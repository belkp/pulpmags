h a lamb

author of tal taulai khan dorgans dcvil-dcvil etc

it was the year of the lion at the very
end of the sixteenth century when khlit
guided his horse into astrakan no
sentries challenged him in the streets of
astrakan for the cossacks were masters here
and no cossack would dishonor himself by
taking precautions against danger there
were many mohammedans in the streets
of astrakan but it was evening and the
followers of allah were repeating the last
of their prayers facing as was the law
toward the city of mecca

  sitting his steppe pony carelessly khlit
allowed the beast to take its own course
the night in midsummer was warm and
his heavy svitza was thrown back on his high
shoulders a woolen cap covered one side
of his gray head and his new pair of costly
red morocco boots were smudged with tar
to show his contempt for appearances
under his shaggy mustache a pipe glowed
and by his side hung the strangely shaped
saber which had earned the cossack the
name of khlit of the curved saber

  khlit rode alone as he had done since
he left the siech where cossack leaders had
said that he was too old to march withthe
army of the ukraine he paid no attention
to the sprawling drunken figures of cos-
sacks that his horse stepped over in the
street clouds of flies from fish houses
odorous along the river front buzzed around
him donkeys driven by naked tatar
urchins passed him in the shadows oc-
casionally the glow from the open front of
an ispahan rug dealers shop showed him
cloaked tatars who swaggered and swore
at him

  being weary khlit paid no heed to these 
a dusty armorers shop under an archway
promised a resting-place for the night and
here he dismounted pushing aside the rug
that served as a door he cursed as he
stumbled over the proprietor of the shop a
syrian who was bowing a yellow face over
a purple shawl in prayer

  lailat el kodr the syrian muttered cast-
ing a swift side glance at the tall cossack

adventure

  khlit did not know the words but that
night thousands of lips were repeating
them-lailat el kadr night of power this
was the night which was potent for the
followers of the true faith when the dhinns
smiled upon mohammed and marduk was
hung by his heels in babylon it is so
written in the book of abulghazi called by
some abulfarajii historian of dynasties

  it was on such a night of power say the
annals of abulghazi that hulagu khan
nephew of ghengis khan and leader of the
golden horde overcame the citadel of
alamut the place of strange wickedness
by the river shahrud in the province of
rudbar it was on that night the power
of hagen ben sabbah was broken

  but the power of hagen ben sabbah was
evil evil says abulghazi is slow to die
the wickedness of alamut lived and around
it clung the shadow of the power that had
belonged to hagen ben sabbah-a power
not of god or man-who was called by some
sheik by others the old man of the moun-
tain and by himself the prophet of god

  it was also written in the book of abul-
ghazi that there was a prophecy that the
waters of the shahrud would be red with
blood and that the evil would be hunted
through the hidden places of alamut a
strange prophecy and never had khlit
the cossack of the curved saber shared in
such a hunt it was not of his own seek-
ing-the hunt that disclosed the secret of
alamut it was chance that made him
a hunter the chance that brought him to
the shop of the syrian armorer seeking
rest

  so it happened that khlit saw the
prophecy of abulghazi who was wise with
an ancient wisdom come to pass-saw the
river stair flash with sword blades and the
banquet-place and the treasure of alamut
under the paradise of the shadna

  lailat el kadr chanted the syrian
his eye on the curved blade of khlit
allah is mighty and there is no god but he

  spawn of islam grunted khlit who
disliked prayer lift your bones and find
for me a place to spend the night and
food

  the cossack spoke in tatar with which
language he was on familiar terms the
response was not slow in coming although
from an unexpected quarter a cloaked
figure rose from the shadows behind the
one lamp which lighted the shop and con-

fronted him the cloak fell to the floor
and disclosed a sturdy form clad in a fur-
tipped tunic under which gleamed a coat
of mail heavy pantaloons and a peaked
helmet a pair of slant bloodshot eyes
stared at khlit from a round face

  khlit recognized the newcomer as a
tatar warrior of rank and noted that while
the other was short his shoulders were wide
and arms long as his knees simultaneously
khlits curved saber flashed into view with
the tatars scimiter

  as quickly the syrian merchant darted
into a corner cossack and tatar enemies
by instinct and choice measured each other
cautiously neither moved waiting for
the other to act khlits pipe fell to the
floor and he did not stoop to pick it up

  toctamish

  it was a womans voice shrill and angry
that broke the silence khlit did not shift
his gaze the tatar scowled sullenly and
growled something beneath his breath

  toctamish fool watch dog is there
no end to your quarreling do your
fingers itch for a sword until you forget my
orders

  the curtains were pushed aside from a
recess in the shop and out of the corner
of his eye khlit saw a slender woman dart
forward and seize the tatar by his squat
shoulders toctamish tried in vain to throw
off the grip that pinned his arms to his side

  one without understanding the tatar
growled here is a dog of a cossack who
would rather slay than eat this is the
khlit i told of the one with the curved
sword are you a child at play

  nay you are the child toctamish
shrilled the woman for you would fight
when the cossack would eat he means
no harm allah keep you further from the
wine cask put up your sword have you
forgotten you are man and i am mistress

  to khlits amusement toctamish who
whether by virtue of wine or his natural
foolhardiness was eager to match swords
dropped his weapon to his side where-
upon khlit lowered his sword and con-
fronted the woman

  beside the square form of toctamish
she looked scarcely bigger than a reed of
the river a pale-blue reed with a flower-
face of delicate olive above the blue
garment which covered her from foot to
throat her black hair hung around a face
which arrested kill its attention too
alamut



narrow to be a tatar yet too dark for a
georgian her head was poised gracefully on
slender shoulders her mouth was small
and her cheeks tinted from olive to pink
the eyes were wide and dark under
khlits gaze she scowled abruptly she
stepped to his side and watched him with
frank curiosity

  do you leave courtesy outside when
you enter a dwelling cossack she de-
manded you come unbidden with dirty
boots and you flourish your curved sword
in front of toctamish who would have killed
you because he is crafty as a kurdish far-
sang and feared you i do not fear you
you have a soiled coat and you carry a foul
stick in your mouth

  khlit grunted in distaste he had small
liking for women this one was neither
tatar nor circassian nor georgian yet she
spoke fair tatar

  devil take me he said i had not come
had i known you were here oh loud voiced
one i came for food and a place to
sleep

  you deserve neither she retorted
following her own thoughts is it true
that you are khlit who fought with the
tatars of tal taulai khan toctamish
is the man of kiragai khan who follows
the banners of tal taulai khan and he has
seen you before it seems he does not like
you yet you have gray hair

  the cossack was not anxious to stay
yet he did not like to go with toctamish
at his back while he hesitated the girl
watched him her lips curved in mockery

  is this the wolf you told me of said
she to toctamish i do not think he is
the one the tatar fold fear see he blinks
like an owl in the light an old gray owl
toctamish made no reply eying khlit
sullenly khlit was fast recovering from
his surprise at the daring of this woman
of a race he had not seen before and very
beautiful who seemed without fear the
daughter of a chieftain he meditated
surely she was one brought up among many
slaves

  aye daughter he responded moodily
gray and therefore forbidden to ride with
the free cossacks my brothers of the siech
wherefore am i alone and my sword at the
service of one who asks it i am no longer
a cossack of cossacks but one alone

  i have heard tales of you the black-
eyed woman stared at him boldly head on

one side did you truly enter here in
peace seeking only food

  aye said khlit

  wait then said she and the nameless
one whose house this is will prepare it for
you meanwhile sheath the sword you
are playing with i shall not hurt you

  motioning toctamish to her side the
woman of the blue cloak withdrew into a
corner of the curtained armorers shop
the cossack who had keen eyes noted that
the syrian was bending his black-capped
head over a bowl of stew which he was
stirring in another corner no others he
decided were in the shop

  toctamish seemed to like his companions
words little he muttered angrily at which
the girl retorted sharply khlit could not
catch their words but he guessed that an
argument was taking place at which the
tatar was faring ill the argument seemed
to be about himself also he heard the
name berea repeated

  although khlit was not of a curious
nature the identity of the girl puzzled him
with the beauty of a high-priced slave
and the manner of a kings daughter she
went unveiled in a land where women
covered their faces from men moreover
she was young being scarce eighteen and
of delicate stature

  khlit bethought him and it crossed his
memory that he had heard of dark-haired
and fair-skinned women of unsurpassed
beauty whose land was at the far end of
the sea of khozar the inland salt sea
they were persians of the province of
rudbar yet fair as they were in the
sight of men none were bought as slaves
berea if that were her name might well
be one of these if that was the case what
was she doing in astrakan alone save for
one tatar who while he was a man of rank
and courage was not her equal

ii

the cossacks meditation was
interrupted by the girl who mo-
tioned to the syrian to set his stew
before khlit

  eat she cried impatiently pointing
to the steaming bowl you are hungry
father of battles and i would speak with
you a man speaks ill on an empty belly
although a woman needs not food nor wine
to sharpen her wits eh look at me and


adventure

say father of battles is it not true i am
beautiful that men would die for me it
is given to few to look at me so closely

  she stepped near the cossack so the
edge of her silk garment touched his shaggy
face where he crouched over the bowl
khlit sniffed and with the odor of lamb stew
he smelled although he knew not its nature
the scent of rose leaves and aloes he
dipped his hand into the bowl and ate

  speak khlit cossack boor shrilled
the woman shaking his shoulder impa-
tiently and say whether it is in your mind
i am beautiful other men are not slow
to say that berea of rudbar and kuhistan
is shapely and tinted as the rose

  khlits hand paused midway to his
mouth

  toctamish has a handsome harlot he
said and swallowed

   the girl stepped back hastily

  clown she whispered softly name-
less one of a dogs breeding you shall
remember that word it was in my mind
to bid you come with me and be companion
to toctamish-

  am i a man for a tatars wench
khlit was making rapid inroads into the
stew

  nay a boor of the steppe remember
your speech is not to be forgotten i am a
chiefs daughter with many horsemen

  berea was watching the cossack half-
angrily half-anxiously toctamish moved
his bulk to the bowl regarding the dis-
appearing contents with regret

  how can one man be courteous berea
of rudbar he asked gruffly when the
tribe is without breeding it were better
to cut the throat of this caphar dog without
faith before he ate of our bread and salt

  nay eat also of the food toctamish
said berea and let me think

  the tatars brown face wrinkled in
distaste

  am i to share bread with a caphar
he snarled truly i promised to obey
you but not thus bid the cossack be gone
and i will eat otherwise he will be
brother in arms and his danger shall be my
danger

  berea stamped her slippered foot im-
patiently

  has allah given me a donkey to follow
me eat your share of the stew toc-
tamish and cease your braying is it not
written in the koran that the most dis-

agreeable of voices is the voice of asses
toctamish remained sullenly silent he
was very hungry likewise khlit was an
enemy of his blood

  eat flat-face chuckled khlit who
was beginning to enjoy himself the stew
is rarely made but the bottom of the
bowl is not far off

  the odor of the food tormented the
tatar and berea for reason of her own
allowed him no chance to back away from
the bowl finally in desperation he
squatted opposite khlit and dipped his
hand into the stew

  remember the law flat-face guf-
fawed khlit as the other ate greedily
we have shared bread and salt together-
i would give a hundred ducats for a mouth-
ful of wine

  it is not i who will forget caphar
retorted toctamish with dignity tugging
at his girdle he held out a small gourd
here is arak drink heartily

  aye said khlit

  he had tasted the heady mares milk
of the tatars before and he sucked his
mustache appreciatively after the draft
pulling pipe and tobacco from a pouch he
proceeded to smoke

  observe said toctamish to berea
to show that he was not softened by what
has passed that the caphar dog is one who
must have two weeds to live he sucks
the top of one and drinks the juice of the
other

  still your tongue said berea sharply
and let me think

  she had seated herself cross-legged by
the bowl and her bird-like glance strayed
from khlit to toctamish the cossack
engrossed in his pipe ignored her

  why did you name me a harlot she
asked abruptly a flush deepening the olive
of her cheeks

  eh i know not sparrow devil take
it a blind man would see you are not kin
to toctamish he is not of your people
and there is no old woman at hand to keep
you out of mischief you have said you
were a chiefs daughter if that is not a lie
then the chief is dead

  the girls eyes widened and toctamish
gaped

  have you a magicians sight caphar
she cried it is true that the sheik my
father is dead but i did not tell you
yet you are alone berea across the
alamut



sea of khozar without attendants a wise
sheik will keep his girl at home except
when she is sent to be married is it not
true that another sent you out of rudbar
bereas dark eyes closed and she rested
her chin quietly on her folded hands one
hand she thrust into the folds of her cloak
at the throat and drew it out clasped around
a small object which hung by a chain from
her slender neck opening her fingers she
disclosed a sapphire of splendid size and
brilliancy set in carved gold the jewel
was of value and appeared to be from the
work-shops of skilled jewelers of tabriz
khlit eyed it indifferently and waited

  it is true that another sent me from
rudbar khlit said berea softly and it
was to be married the one who sent me
sent also some slaves and an attendant
he swore that a certain chief a khan of
the kallmarks had asked me for his wife
and i went not desiring to stay in rudbar
after my father died

 the kallmarks khlit frowned
why you are a persian and the kallmark
tatars make war on persians as did their
fathers a marriage would be strange
eh who sent you

  berea lowered her voice further and
glanced at the persian armorer who was
snoring in his corner

  one it was who is better not named
she whispered he is neither sheik nor
khan listen cossack this is a jewel of
rare value it has no mate this side of
damascus would you like to own it
aye said khlit indifferently at what
price

  service

 do you want another toctamish
buy him in the streets of astrakan is a
free cossack to be bought

  nay khlit whispered berea leaning
close to him until her loose curls touched
his eyes the service is for one who can
use his sword we heard in tatary how
you escaped from tal taulai khan and
his myriad horsemen men say that you
are truly the father of battles i have work
for such a one listen i was sent from
rudbar to kiragai khan up the sea of
khozar and across the jaick river with
one attendant and a box which the attend-
ant said held jewels and gold bars for my
dowry i came to the court of kiragai

khan-

  bah sparrow khlit yawned sleepily

you are tiresome i want sleep not

words in the morning-

  we will be gone from astrakan
berea held up the sapphire you must
listen cossack i told kiragai khan
my mission for there were no others to
speak and opened the box in the hands of
the attendant the jewels were poor
pearls and no gold was in the box then
kiragai khan before whom i had unveiled
my face laughed and said that he had not
sent for me at first it came to my mind
that it was because the jewels were worth-
less but it was the truth

  aye said toctamish suddenly it
was the truth

  i went quickly from the country of
kiragai khan aided by toctamish who
pitied me when others tried to sell me a
slave-of a race that are not slaves at
astrakan we learned the whole truth for
here word came to us that the one who sent
me in marriage had killed my father i
was sent to be out of the way for it would
not do to sell one of my blood as slave
such is not the law he who killed my
father heeds no law yet he is crafty
then inquired khlit you would slay
him give toctamish a dagger and a dark
night and it is done

  iierca shook her head scornfully

  no dagger could come near this man
she said bitterly and he is beyond our
reach he has many thousand hidden
daggers at his call his empire is from
samarkand to aleppo and from tatary
to the indian sea he is more feared than
tal taulai khan of the horde

  then he must be a great sheik yawned
khlit

  he is not a sheik protested berea
and her eyes widened and his stronghold
is under the ground not on it men say
his power lies in his will to break all laws
for he has made his followers free from all
law what he wants he takes from others
and he is glad when blood is shed do
you know of him

  aye said khlit grinning the steppe
fox

  they call you the wolf pleaded berea
and i need your counsel and wisdom
this man i am seeking has a name no one
makes a jest of-twice he is called by
some the arch prophet by others the old
man of the mountain and by others the
shadna of the refik folk he is the head


adventure

of an empire that lays tribute on every
city in persia kurdistan khorassan syria
and anatolia if allah decreed that i
should be his death i should be content
more likely dead responded khlit
truly if these are not lies your old man
of the mountain must be a good fighter
and i would cross swords with him can
you show him to me

  aye khlit said berea eagerly if
you come with me there is the sapphire
if you will come to rudbar with me

  khlit stretched his tall bulk lazily

  one way is as good as the other to me
if there is fighting he muttered sleepily
only talk not of rewards for a cossack
takes his pay from the bodies of enemies
i will kill this master of the mountain for
you let me sleep now for your voice is
shrill

 when toctamish and berea had left the
shop of the armorer the former to seek a
shed outside and the persian girl to sleep
in her recess khlits snores matched those
of the syrian shopkeeper in volume for
a while only then it happened that the
snores of the syrian ceased

  without disturbing khlit who was
stretched full length on the floor the syrian
silently pushed past the hangings over the
door once outside he broke into a trot
his slippers pad-padding the dark street
nor did he soon slacken his pace

m

ftil khlit and toctamish did not
make the best of bed-fellows berea
sife however was careful to see that
no serious quarrel broke out between the
two in a bark that went from aslrakan
the day after their meeting to the south
shore of the sea of khozar the two warriors
of different races occupied a small cupboard
which adjoined the cabin of the sheiks
daughter

  khlit had embarked not altogether
willingly when the fumes of arak had
cleared from his head the next morning
he had half-repented of his bargain curi-
osity to see the other side of the salt sea
which he had known as the caspian
rather than the pleadings of berea finally
brought him aboard the bark with his
horse from which he refused to be separated

  the girl had bought their passage with
the last of her pearls and some gold of

toctamishs and had remained in her cabin
since to which toctamish brought food
the cossack after a survey of the small
vessel which disclosed his fellow-voyagers
as some few syrian silk-merchants with
the tatar crew took possession of a nook
in the high poop deck and kept a keen look-
out for the islands and other vessels they
passed and for bab-al-abuab the lofty gate
of gates as the ship made its way southward
toctamish who had not set foot on a ship
before was very ill to khlits silent
satisfaction

  one day when the wind was too high for
comfort on deck the cossack sought toc-
tamish in the cupboard where the latter lay
ill at ease on some skins

  hey flat-face khlit greeted him
sitting opposite against the side of the dark
recess you look as if the devil himself
was chewing at your entrails can you
speak as well as you grunt i have a word
for you where is the little berea

   in her cabin oh dog without breeding
snarled the tatar who was less disposed
to speak even than usual looking at
silks of a syrian robber this sickness of
the sea is a great sickness for i am not
accustomed

  you will not die khlit stroked his
saber thoughtfully across his boots toc-
tamish gully-jackal and dog of an un-
believing race you have been a fool
perhaps a greater one than i how did
it happen that you became the follower
of the little berea has she bewitched
you with her smooth skin and dark eyes

   nay that is not so toctamish growled
she has told you her story it is true
that kiragai khan my master did not
know of her coming her attendant and
slaves ran away and she felt great shame
yet she did not lose courage when her
shame was the greatest she begged me to
take her to astrakan saying that i should
be head of her army she did not say
her army was beyond the salt sea then
she made me promise to take her to her
people as you know her tongue is
golden

  aye said khlit then you are even
a greater fool than i had thought have
you heard of this emperor she is taking
us to

  toctamish rolled his eyes and shook his
head vaguely

  his name is not known in our countries
alamut



mongol tatars say that their great-grand-
fathers who followed the banners of hulagu
khan made war on one calling himself the
old man of the mountain and slew many
thousands with much booty beside burning
the citadel of alamut which was his strong-
hold they gave me a dagger which came
from alamut it is a strange shape

  if the power of the old man of the
mountain was broken in the time of hulagu
khan said khlit idly how can it exist
now have you the dagger

  the tatar motioned to his belt with a
groan and khlit drew from it a long blade
with heavy handle the dagger was of
tempered steel curved like a tongue of fire
on it were inscribed some characters which
were meaningless to khlit he balanced
it curiously in his bon hand

  i have seen the like flat-face he
meditated idly it could strike a good
blow hey i remember where i have
seen others like it in the shop of the
syrian armorer at astrakan who brought
you to the shop

  we came dog of a cossack the
syrian bade us stay charging nothing for
our beds only for food

  does he understand tatar language
nay berea spoke with him in her own
tongue

  aye did she speak with you of this
old man of the mountain

  once she said that her people had
come under the power of the did man of
the mountain also that her home was
near to alamut toctamish hesitated
one thing more she said

  well god has given you a tongue to
speak

  she said that your curved sword was
useless against him who is called the old
man of the mountain

  with this the tatar rolled over in his
skins and kept silence wearying of ques-
tioning him khlit rose and went to the
door of bereas cabin toctamish he
meditated was not one who could invent
answers to questions out of his own wit
either he spoke the truth or he had been
carefully taught what to say khlit was
half-satisfied that the girls and the tatars
story was true in all its details strange
as it seemed yet he was wise with the
wisdom of years and certain things troubled
him

  it was not customary for a tatar of rank

to follow the leadership of a woman also
it was not clear why berea should have
been so eager for the services of khlit
the wolf again she had declared that
the old man of the mountain was not
to be met with yet apparently she sought
him

  pondering these things khlit tapped
lightly on the door of the girls cabin
there was no response and he listened
from within he could hear the quiet
breathing of a person in sleep

  he had come to speak with berea and
he was loath to turn back pushing open
the door he was about to step inside when
he paused

  full length on the floor lay berea on
the blue cloak she always wore her black
curls flowed over a silk pillow on which
her head rested her eyes were closed and
her face so white that khlit wondered it
had ever been pink

  what drew the cossacks gaze were two
objects on the floor beside her khlit saw
so close that some of the dark hairs were
caught in them two daggers sticking up-
right on either side of the girls head the
daggers were curved like a tongue of fire

  khlits glance roaming quickly about the
cabin told him that no one else was there
berea had not carried two weapons of such
size another had placed them there as
he noticed the silk cushion he remembered
the syrian silk-merchant who had been
with berea

  with a muttered curse of surprise khlit
stepped forward treading lightly in his
heavy boots leaning over the girl he
scanned her closely her breathing was
quiet and regular and her clothing un-
disturbed seeing that she was asleep the
cossack turned his attention to the
weapons

  drawing the latter softly from the wood
he retreated to the door closing this
he climbed to the deck and scanned it for
the syrian merchant almost within reach
he saw the one he sought in a group of
several ragged traders squatting by the
rail of the ship no one noticed him their
black sheepskin hats bent together in
earnest conversation

  with the daggers under his arm khlit
swaggered over to the group the men
looking up silently at his approach

  hey infidel dogs he greeted them
here is a pair of good daggers i found
io

adventure

lying by the steps who owns them
speak

   his eye traveled swiftly over the brown
faces none of the group showed interest
beyond a curl of the lips at his words if
he had expected the owner to claim his
property he was disappointed the syrians
resumed their talk together

  so be it said khlit loudly they
are useless to me away with them

  balancing the weapons he hurled them
along the deck as he did so he glanced
at the traders their conversation was
uninterrupted yet khlit saw one of the
group look hastily after the flying daggers
it was only a flash of white eyeballs in a
lean face but khlit stared closer at the
fellow who avoided his eye

   something in the mans face was familiar
to the cossack khlit searched his memory
and smiled to himself the man who had
watched the fate of the daggers khlit had
seen in astrakan the man had changed
his style of garments but khlit was
reasonably sure that he was no other than
the syrian armorer who had offered his
shop to berea and toctamish

   fingering his sword the cossack hesi-
tated it was in his mind to ask at the
swords point what the other had been
doing in bereas cabin yet if the fellow
admitted he had left the daggers by the
 girl and khlit did not kill him the syrian
would be free to work other mischief
and khlit careless as he was of life could
see no just reason for killing the syrian
better to let the man go he thought
unaware that he was suspected and watch

   as an afterthought khlit went to where
the twisted daggers lay on the deck and
threw them over the side

iv

in the year of the lion there
was a drouth around the sea of
khozar and the salt fields of its
south shore whitened in the sun where
the caravan route from samarkand to
bagdad crossed the salt fields the watering-
places were dry all save a very few

  the sun was reflected in burning waves
from the crusted salt from which a rock
cropped out occasionally and the wind
from the sea did not serve to cool the air
in the annals of abulghazi it is written that
men and camels of the caravans thirsted

in this year the year in which the waters
of shahrud by the citadel of alamut were
to be red with blood

  at one of the few watering-places near
the shore bereas party of three with a
pack-donkey came to a halt at the same
time that a caravan coming from the east
stopped to refresh the animals

  the persian girl watched the kurdish
camel-drivers lead their beasts to kneel by
the well silently khlit beside her gazed
attentively although with apparent indif-
ference at the mixed throng of white-and-
brown-robed traders with their escort of
mounted kurds many looked at berea
who was heavily veiled but kept their
distance at sight of khlit

  it is written abulfetah barb issa
father of battles spoke the girl softly
that a man must be crafty and wise when
peril is round his road else is his labor
vain he follows a luck that flees truly
there is no luck for allah has traced our
lives in the divining sands and we follow
our paths as water follows its course are
you as wise as the masters of evil oh
cossack

  the words were mocking and khlit
laughed

  little sparrow he said i have seen
ever so much evil and there was none that
did not fade when a good sword was waved
in front of it yet never have i followed
a woman

  you will not follow me much further
cossack i will leave you at the foothills
to go among my people the hillmen where
i shall be safe you and toctamish will go
alone the rest of the way my face is
known to the people of alamut who sup-
pose that i am dead or a slave in time
they shall see me but not yet meanwhile
it is my wish that you and toctamish seek
the citadel of alamut which lies a two-
days journey into the interior

  khlit shaded his eyes with a lean hand
and gazed inland above the plain of salt
levels he could see a nest of barren foothills
which surrounded mountains of great size
and height

  where lies the path to this alamut-
he had begun when berea shook his arm
angrily

  not so loud fool of the steppe do
you think we are still by the volga we
are already in the territory of the old man
of the mountain listen to what i have
alamut

ii

already told toctamish two days travel
to the south will bring you to the district
of rudbar you will find yourself near
the river shahrud which flows from the
mountains there will be hillmen about who
do not love the old man of the mountain

  so do not speak his name until you come
to a bend in the shahrud where the river
doubles on itself so like a twisted snake
across the river will be a mountain of rock
which will appear to be a dog kneeling
facing you remain there until armed
men ride up and question you then say
you are come to join the ranks of sheik
halen ibn shaddah who is the old man
of the mountain

  khlit shook his head and tapped his sword
thoughtfully

  nay little berea he said reproachfully
you have told me lies you said it was
your wish to slay one who had slain your
father and because it was a just quarrel
and i was hungry for sight of the world
below the salt sea i came to aid you
are you one oh sparrow to fight alone
against a powerful chief where are your
men that you told toctamish of devil
take me if ill put my head in the strong-
hold of any sheik as you call him

  berea bent nearer rising on tiptoe so her
breath was warm in his ear

  my men are hillmen who will not attack
until they see an enemy flee also they
have seen men who opposed halen ibn
shaddah set over a fire with the skin of
their feet torn off the master of alamut
is all powerful here are you afraid whom
they call the wolf

  nay little sparrow how should i be
afraid of womens tales and a mysterious
name tell me your plan and i will con-
sider it how can this sheik be reached
halen ibn shaddah is safe from the
swords of his enemies yet there is a way
to reach him in alamut the time will
come when you and toctamish will find
yourselves at the head of many swords
how can i tell you who are a fool in our
way of fighting and know not alamut
what is in my mind i swear that soon
halen ibn shaddah will be attacked do
you believe my word

  wherefore should i

  khlit tugged at his mustache moodily
he was accustomed to settle his quarrels
alone and he liked little to move in the dark
yet the woman spoke as one having

authority and toctamish believed in her
blindly

  if this sheik halen is powerful and

crafty-

  still i am a woman and wronged by
a great wrong i was sent to offer myself
unveiled to a man who had not sought me
and at the same time my father was mur-
dered so that the hillmen of whom he was
sheik might come under the shadow of
alamut the girls voice was low but the
words trembled with passion and the dark
eyes that peered at the cossack over her
veil were dry as with fever and burning
halen ibn shaddah shall pay for his evil
for he is cursed in the sight of allah
wicked-wicked beyond telling is alamut
and therefore cursed

  chirp shrilly little sparrow laughed
khlit while your white throat is still
unslit this sheik halen has no love for
you for one of his men on the bark placed
two daggers one on each side of your
black head devil take me if i did not
think you would never chirp again it was
the syrian who took you in for so little pay

at astrakan-

  fool stupid cossack bereas eyes
suddenly swam with laughter did you
think i was asleep when you tiptoed in like
a bear treading nettles or that i did not
see the dirty syrian who thought to catch
me asleep look among the men of the
caravan and tell me if you see the syrian
cautiously khlit scanned the groups
about the well among the kurdish riders
and tatars who were brown with the dust
of the desert trail from samarkand he
recognized a bent figure in a long gray
cloak and black kollah as he watched
the figure it bent still further over a box
of goods and lifted some silks to view
it was the syrian without doubt khlit
felt a thrill as of one who is hunted and
hears the cry of the chase he stepped
forward with an oath when bereas grasp
tightened on his arm

  that is a fedavie of alamut she
whispered i saw the curved daggers
and they are the weapons of the refik folk
of halen ibn shaddah he must have
overheard us in his shop at astrakan and
has followed to slay as is the law of alamut
probably there are more of the fedavie
among the men of the caravan

  then we must deal with the syrian
before he can speak to them muttered


adventure

khlit but again berea tugged him back

  did i not say you were a fool among
my people oh wolf she whispered
watch the syrian shall have his reward
your folly is very great yet i need a man
who is blunt and brave and knows not my
plans it is written that none knows
where his grave is dug yet the syrians
grave is here watch and do not move

  khlit waited the fedavie had stooped
over his box one or two kurds gathered
to look at its contents among the group
khlit noticed toctamish who had come up
quietly the tatar pushed past the others
heedless of their muttered curses until he
stood directly in front of the trader the
syrian looked up and seeing toctamish
was motionless

  khlit saw the kurds stare and draw back
as if they sensed trouble the syrian
still watching toctamish rose with a swift
cat-like movement his hand hidden in the
silks toctamish grunted something and
spat upon the silks

  see whispered berea softly his grave
is dug and the nameless one sees it

  toctamish thrust his yellow scarred face
near the syrians around him a crowd
pressed watching with attention with a
cry the syrian who seemed to have found
the suspense too much for him drew a pistol
from the silks in which it had been con-
cealed

  instantly two giant arms were flung
round him toctamish was on him with
a speed that baffled him and the tatars
huge bulk pressed the syrian backward
to the ground writhing impotently the
syrian saw toctamish draw a dagger from
his girdle and khlit grunted as he noted
that it was the one he had seen with blade
like a curved flame while he held the
smaller man powerless with one arm
toctamish lifted the dagger and thrust it
carefully into his foes body into stomach
and chest

  then rising he wiped the curved dagger
on a handful of the traders silks for
a moment the arms and legs of the unhappy
syrian stirred on the ground and khlit
saw a strange thing for before life had
gone from the body several men of the
caravan khirghiz warriors by their dress
pushed through the throng with daggers
like that of toctamish and struck at the
syrian not until the body was still did
they cease to strike

  then the khirghiz men looked around for
toctamish but the stocky tatar had dis-
appeared in the throng khlit who had
missed nothing of what happened thought
to himself that it was well that the dagger
had been in the hand of toctamish not of
the syrian plainly he thought the khir-
ghiz murderers had been fellows without
knowing to the syrian and he wondered
how men of many races came to be banded
together not knowing that he was to wonder
soon and very greatly at other things

v

berca had disappeared and when
khlit strode through the crowd of
the caravan seeking her his horse
at his elbow he met toctamish the tatar
was mounted and leading the pack-mule
mount he said gruffly and follow
and what of the girl queried khlit
who was unwilling to take orders from
toctamish

  she has told us to go on as you know
caphar snarled the tatar who disliked
to talk later she will send word to us
come

  we are both fools you to be the slave
of a painted girl and i to seek for an empire
which is not to be found to slay a man
who is hidden

  khlits words were silenced by a sudden
uproar in the caravan men sprang to
their feet and hauled at the camels who
had kneeled in weariness traders who
had been eating gave shouts of lamentation
laden slaves ran together in confusion

  toctamish stared at the uproar until
khlit touched his shoulder

  look he said

  from the south over the salt desert a
cloud of dust was threading in and out
among the rocks it was advancing swiftly
toward them and the cossack could see
that it was made by mounted men riding
very fast he made out turbans and spear-
points in the dust the horsemen were
headed directly toward the caravan

  robbers- said toctamish briefly
there will be a fight

  a poor one it seems growled khlit
the kurds are leaving us as fast as their
horses can take them and your countrymen
like the looks of things little-they have
not drawn sword or bow

  in truth the tatars who were acting as
alamut



guard sat their horses stolidly while the
dismayed traders added to the confusion
by rushing about frantically trying to
assemble their goods khlit turned his
attention in disgust to the oncoming
horsemen and counted a bare two score
in numbers the caravan was three times
as strong yet no attempt at defense was
made

  instead the traders were anxiously
spreading out their bales of goods so that
all were displayed camels and donkeys
were stripped and their burden placed on
the ground in the meantime the horse-
men who had come up were trampling
recklessly through the confusion

  a fat greek merchant held out an armful
of rugs to one of the riders who stared at it
insolently and pointed to the heavy packs
behind the merchant other riders jerked
out the contents of these packs and ranged
them in nine piles

  khlit watching them saw that they
were men of varied race he guessed at
persian kurd circassian turk and others
with whom he was not familiar-dark-
skinned and heavily-cloaked who sat their
horses as a swallow rides the wind also
the khirghiz men of the caravan had joined
the newcomers

  the first rider flung some words at the
greek who was cowering on the ground
and khlit thought he caught the phrase
alamut then the horsemen picked up
three of the nine piles of goods and flung
them over pack-horses other riders who
had been similarly occupied joined them
all the while the tatar guardians of the
caravan watched without interest as men
who had seen the like before

  it was not until the horsemen were well
away over the salt plain that khlit recov-
ered from his astonishment at the sight of
few robbing many

  better the mountain-folk than these
he growled spitting in the direction of the
merchants who were putting their goods
away amid lamentations

  so it came to pass that a cossack rode
into the foothills of rudbar where in the
words of the historian abulghazi none set
foot who held allah or christ for their true
god and with him rode a tatar who under
other circumstances would gladly have slain
him

  they rode in silence as rapidly as the
pack animal could move and by nightfall

had gained the edge of the salt deposits
that made that part of persia like a frozen
lake

  each made camp after his fashion and
two fires were lighted instead of one
khlit produced some barley cakes and
wine and made a good meal toctamish
took some raw meat from under his saddle
where he had placed it for seasoning and
washed it down with his favorite arak
both kindled pipes and sat in silence in the
darkness

  toctamishs pipe went out first and
khlit knew that the tatar had swallowed
the smoke until with the burning arak he
had lost consciousness the cossack was
soon asleep

  his sleep was unbroken except that
near dawn he thought he heard the tramp-
ling of many horses feet which sounded
until the rays of the sun slipping into liis
eyes awoke him he made out at some dis-
tance the track of a cavalcade in the dust
and considered that it might have been
a caravan yet it was out of the path of
caravans moreover he was reasonably
sure the track had not been there the night
before toctamish when wakened yawned
in bad spirits and told khlit he was an old
woman of great fear and unmentionable
descent

  when they resumed their path it led
upward through the foothills of rudbar
a few date trees and some thorn bushes
lined the way but for the most part there
was little foliage and many rocks the
grass however was good and this was
perhaps the reason why groups of horses
were met with under the care of single
mounted horsemen who watched khlit and
his companion with curiosity

  they rode apart and silently as before
khlits thoughts dwelt on bereas last
words the girl had spoken as one having
authority she was no ordinary sheiks
daughter living out of sight of men he
thought she was daring and he wondered
if she came from one of the hill-tribes where
the women ride with men

  berea had told him they were in the land
of halen ibn shaddah in the territory
of the refik folk yet khlit saw no signs
of a town or city he did see the tracks of
multitudes of horses in the mountains
where caravans were unknown and the
horses themselves puzzled him for he
could see nothing of their riders


adventure

  toctamish apparently wasted no
thought on his surroundings he rode
warily but kept his thoughts to himself
and pressed onward rapidly thus it was
that the two came to a wide shallow river
and followed the bank along a valley that
seemed to sink further into the hills as
they advanced

  until sunset they rode making detours
to avoid waterfalls and fording the river
where it curved-for it was very shallow-
and then khlit who was in the lead came
to a halt as they rounded a bend

  by the bones of satan he swore here
is the place berea told us of devil take
me if it does not look like a dog with his
front paws in the river

  like an arched bow the river curved
with the two riders standing at the end of
the bow looking inward across from
them rose a high point of rock serried and
overgrown with bushes several hundred
feet no trees were on the summit of the
rock instead khlit could make out
masses of stones tumbling together and
overgrown a few pillars stood up through
the debris

  around the summit ran the semblance
of a wall so great was the waste of stone
that it was hard to see any semblance of
order in it but khlit judged that a citadel
as big as a good-sized town had once
crowned the dog-promontory the rock
jutted out to make the massive head of the
beast and ridges suggested paws

  here is no alamut toctamish growled
khlit in disgust truly we are fools-
the little sparrow berea has made game
of us

  wait caphar retorted toctamish
dismounting she said we would find the
dog sitting in the river thus and we have
found it we will wait here and see what
happens

  well we will wait laughed khlit
and see if the dog will give birth to a
tribe

vi

little khlit suspected how true
his chance word was to be- the
sun had dropped behind the furthest
mountain summit and the night cold of
the high elevation had wrapped around the
two watchers when they saw a sight that
made their blood stir

  the cossack had stretched on the ground
a little distance from toctamish who had
subsided into snores he watched the last
light melt from the ruins on the summit of
the cliff and as he watched he thought
he heard echoes from across the river as
from far off straining his ears he could
catch bursts of music and shouting re-
membering his experience with the horses
the previous night he wondered if the
mountains were playing tricks with his
ears

  the sounds would come in bursts as
though a gate had been opened to let them
out followed by silence khlit was not
at home in the hills and he did not recognize
the peculiar resonance of echoes what he
thought he heard were songs and shouts
repeated from mouth to mouth as by
giants in the heart of the rock opposite
him

  lighting his pipe and cursing himself
for a dreaming fool khlit sat up and
scanned the darkness over the river as
if to mock him the burst of shouting
became clearer and then the skfa moved
along khlits back of its own accord and
his jaw dropped he shook his head
angrily to make sure he was still awake

  out of the rock across the river a multi-
tude of lights were flickering the lights
came toward him rapidly and the shouting
grew there were torches moving out on
the river and by their glare he could see
a mass of moving men armed with spears
and bows splashing through the water
they were fording the shallow river

  khlit could see that they were men of
varied race turbaned and doaked armed
for the most part with bow and arrows
much like those who had robbed the cara-
van as the throng came nearer he shook
toctamish and stood up

  loosen your sword father of swine
he grunted here are men who are not
triflers

  several of the leaders who had caught
sight of the two closed around them the
torchlight was thrown in their faces and
for a moment the shouting of the band
was silenced as they surveyed khlit and
his companion one very lean and dark
of face dressed in a white coat bossed with
gold and wearing a tufted turban of the
same colors spoke in a tongue khlit did not
understand

  hey brothers swore khlit genially
alamut



laughing for the presence of danger pleased
him have you any who speak like chris-
tians khlit called the wolf would speak
with you

  after some delay a dirty tribesman was
thrust beside the man of white and gold

  wherefore are you here the tribesman
who seemed to be a kurd asked in broken
russian and what is your purpose be
brief for the dais are impatient to march
are you a christian cossack

  say that you are not whispered
toctamish who had caught what was said
for none with a god can go into the
mountain

  a dog will give up his faith snarled
khlit but a cossack does not deny god
and the orthodox church aye he re-
sponded to the kurd i am a christian
i have come to rudbar or to alamut
whatever you call the place to seek him
who is called the old man of the moun-
tain what is your name and faith

  a peculiar look of fear crossed the face of
the kurd

  seek you the master of the mountain
sheik halen ibn shaddah cossack my
name is iba kabash and i was once a
christian what is your mission with
the lord of alamut

  tell the unbeliever we have come to
join the refik where there is no law-
began toctamish but khlit motioned him
to silence

  take us to sheik halen ibn shaddah
and we will tell him our mission iba
kabash he retorted we are not men
to parley with slaves

  the man of white and gold had grown
impatient and spoke a few angry words to
iba kabash who cringed several of the
bowmen ranged themselves beside them
and the throng pushed past leaving a single
torch with the kurd who motioned to
khlit to follow him leaving their horses
with an attendant khlit and toctamish
made their way after iba kabash to the
river the current was not overswift and
the water came barely to their knees

  it is the wish of the dai cossack that
you shall enter alamut what is your mis-
sion tell me and i shall be a true friend
i swear it surely you have a strong reason
for your coming the kurds greasy head
was thrust close to the cossacks let
me hear but a word

  if the dai named you guide iba kabash

of the mangy beard lead us and talk not

  in his heart khlit distrusted the offered
friendship of the kurd and he watched
closely where they went across the shahrud
into the shadows of the further bank and
he saw how it was the dais followers had
come from the mountain

  concealed by the shadows were grottoes
where the water had eaten into the rock
grottoes which ran deep into the mountain
the torch reflected from the dark surface
of the water as they splashed forward
with the river becoming shallower pres-
ently they stood on dry rock here they
were in a cave of which khlit could not see
the top

  iba kabash pulled impatiently at his arm
and they went forward and up khlit
saw that now they were on rock which was
the handiwork of man they were ascend-
ing broad steps each one a pace in width
and so broad that the torch barely showed
rows of stone pillars on either side

  khlit had counted fifty steps when iba
kabash came to a halt grinning lifting
the torch overhead he pointed to a square
stone set in the rocky roof of the stairs
on this rock were lines of writing strange to
khlit and blackened with age and the
dampness of the place

  the gateway of alamut oh cossack
laughed the kurd and the writing of
one who was as great as mohammed
prophet of allah and the message

           with the help of god
           the ruler of the world
           loosened the bands of the law

           blessed be his name

  khlit was silent he had not expected
to find himself in a cave in the heart of
a mountain the darkness and damp
rising from the river chilled him glancing
ahead he saw a rocky passage wide and
lofty the passage had been made by the
river perhaps in a former age when it had
risen to that level but the hands of men
had widened it and smoothed the walls
toctamish he saw was scrutinizing his
surroundings his slant eyes staring from a
lined yellow face

  come said iba kabash who seemed
to enjoy the silence of his visitors this was
not the gateway of alamut always in the
days of the first master of the mountain
and alamut has changed it has sunk into
the mountain men say the old alamut
was destroyed
i

adventure

  aye said toctamish suddenly by
hulagu khan

  the kurd stared at him curiously

  come he muttered and led the way up
the winding rock passage

  khlit followed closely other passages
joined the one they were in at times
sounds came down these passages-distant
rumblings and strains of music occasion-
ally a figure armed with a spear stepped
from them and scanned the group always
a wind whipped around them cold in spite
of the heat of the air outside

  after a time khlit saw that they were no
longer in the passage the torch did not
reveal walls and the footing was regular
of stone slabs they had entered a cham-
ber of some kind other torches made their
appearance suddenly the sound of voices
came to them clearly

  they approached a fire around which
lay several armed men khlit guessed from
their dress that they were khirghiz men
furthermore that they appeared drunk
only one or two looked up without interest
iba kabash led them past many fires and
men until they came to narrow stone stairs
which led away from the rock chambers
here a giant turk spoke with iba kabash
before letting them pass

  we will speak with rashideddin whis-
pered the kurd the astrologer of halen
ibn shaddah tell me now your mission
i can help you

  toctamish would have spoken fingering
a money pouch at his belt on which the
kurds gaze fastened greedily but khlit
shook his head with a sneer their guide
stepped on the stairway khlit climbed
after him and noted that the stairs wound
up still further he guessed that they
had ascended several hundred feet since
leaving the bed of the river

  then leaving the stair he found himself
in a round chamber hung with tapestries
and rugs of great beauty several oil
lamps suspended from the ceiling lighted
the place a warm breath of air caused
him to look up a circular opening formed
the center of the ceiling and through this
he could see the stars and the velvet vault
of the sky

  two of the dark-faced men strange to
khlit like the dai of white and gold stood
by the wall wearing mail and resting on
spears a small ebony table was loaded
with parchments and instruments which

the cossack had never seen before in
the center of the floor was a chess-board
and sitting on either side of the chess-
board were two men

  one khlit recognized by his tufted
turban and brilliant white coat to be of the
kind iba kabash had called dai the other
wore a close-fitting skullcap and a gray
cloak without a sash he looked at khlit
and the latter saw a lean face gray almost
as the cloak with close-set black eyes and a
loose-lipped mouth very pale

  oh rashideddin said iba kabash
here are the two who have just come of
whom i have sent word the cossack is
a christian and insolent the other is alto
gether a fool

vii

gzta rashideddin is mentioned in
the annals of abulghazi as a savant
of the khaliate of bagdad and
damascus he was a persian trained in
the arts of astrology and divination who
could recite from memory the works of
jelaleddin rumi he was acquainted with
many languages including russian and
tatar it is believed that he possessed
all the works of the alamut library which
escaped the destructive hands of hulagu
khan

  inscrutable and gifted rashideddin
made a mockery of the koran he kept
his truly great wisdom to himself except
for certain poems which he sent to princes
of persia and arabia who gained no happi-
ness thereby so it was not strange that
rashideddin the savant of dark knowledge
came to a place of evil of strange and very
potent evil so say the annals of abul-
ghazi

  rashideddin did not look at his visitors
he lifted a piece with care and replaced it
on the chessboard the dai who khlit
observed was drunk as were the men
aroimd the fires yet very pale did likewise
khlit who had small liking for chess
watched the players rather than the board
especially did he watch rashideddin the
pale-lipped astrologer sat with half-closed
eyes intent and motionless the gray
cloak seemed not to move with his breath-
ing when he spoke his deep and musical
voice startled them

  have you a god cossack is your
faith firm in the christian cross you wear
around your neck
alamut



  startled khlit moved his hand to his
throat where hung a small gold cross
iba kabash was making hasty signs to him
which he did not see

  aye rashideddin said he gravely
the batko has told me about the cross which
i carry and it is a talisman against evil
hey it has been good that cross be-
cause i have killed many and am still
living

  evil said rashideddin and moved
a jeweled chessman to another square
the earth is evil if a saint handles
earth it becomes gold yet who has seen
a saint do you seek to bring your cross
into alamut

  not so rashideddin vouchsafed khlit
crossing his arms i bring a sword to
alamut to halen ibn shaddah the cross
is my own if you can see it through my
svitza then you must have good eyes i am
outcast from my people of the ukraine
and men told me there was work for swords
with halen ibn shaddah

  and you call yourself khlit the wolf
queried the astrologer how did you find
the gate of alamut

  khlit was bewildered at the astrologers
knowledge of his name until he remembered
that he had told it to iba kabash

  aye there was a caravan by the sea
of khozar that a band from alamut robbed
we khlit bethought him swiftly fol-
lowed the riders to the mountains and
waited by the gate

  rashideddin considered the chessboard
silently

  you came over the sea of khozar he
murmured from astrakan that must
have been the way there is another way
around by land that the caravans take
they are our prey what the kallmark
tatars leave the merchants we share did
you see a syrian armorer in astrakan
aye a bearded fellow we stayed at
his house he told us we might find use for
our swords with halen ibn shaddah
with a delicate movement rashideddin
lifted one of his opponents pieces from the
board

  and your companion he said

  a tatar horseman who has quarreled
with his kin spoke up toctamish bluntly

im tired of laws noble sir and i-

  laws are too complex tatar if a
man has an enemy slay him if a man
desires a certain thing take it are not



these the only laws in alamut you are
free from all laws except those of the rejik
you have an image of natagai in your
girdle tatar rashideddin had not looked
at toctamish since the first moment
take it and throw it on the floor

  toctamish hesitated he glanced irreso-
lutely at khlit then drew out a small cloth
figure painted like a doll and tossed it on
the stones the cossack saw that it was
ragged and worn by much use he had
not suspected that his companion cherished
ahy holy image

  spit on it directed rashideddin softly

  with a muttered curse toctamish did so
his lined face was damp with perspiration
and khlit saw that his hands were trem-
bling the shifting eyes of iba kabash
gleamed mockingly

  the armorer at astrakan must have told
you that alamut is no place for one who
has a god went on rashideddin there
is one here who is greater than mohammed
we are his servants yet our akd says that
none go forth who are not of us think
khlit and decide meanwhile-

  the astrologer spoke to iba kabash in
another tongue and the kurd went to a
comer of the room where a pile of rugs and
cloths lay selecting a long white cloth
he laid it in front of khlit this done
he stepped back licking his thick lips
softly

  tell the cossack what you have done
iba kabash said rashideddin

  this cloth whispered the kurd is a
shroud khlit the astrologer may call his
men and lay you in it dead unless you say
you have no god do as your friend-
remember i have given you good advice
you are in a place where your life is worth
no more than a dagger-thrust your sword
will be useless

  with a beating heart khlit glanced
around the chamber the two mailed
tatars were watching him silently he
thought he could see the dim forms of other
men in recesses in the wall and for all
rashideddins unconcern he felt that the
astrologer was alive to every move he made
he felt as he had once when the krim
tatars had bound his limbs leaving him
powerless

  aye he said

  without looking at rashideddin he
moved to the pile of cloths and selected
another shroud this he brought back
i

adventure

and placed beside the other iba kabash
watched him with staring eyes the dai
frowned and fingered a dagger at his girdle
khlit drew his curved sword and stood over
the white cloths

  tell rashideddin iba kabash he said
what this othfir shroud is for

  what-how do you mean muttered
the kurd

  it is for the man who first tries to kill
me dog snarled khlit

  the astrologer bent over the chessboard
impassively apparently he was blind to
what passed in the room and to the words
of iba kabash the others watched him
and there was silence until rashideddin
raised his head suddenly and compressed his
pale ups

  you fool he smiled blunderer of the
steppes this is not russia here there
is one law and punishment murder
see

  he pointed a white hand at one of the
mailed tatars the man started forward
and drew back shivering

  kill thyself fellow said rashideddin
quietly

  the tatar stared at him and cast a help-
less glance around the room khlit saw his
right hand go to his girdle and tremble
convulsively

  fedaviel the astrologers voice was
gentle show the russian our law by the
oath of the refik kill thyself

  with a grunt of sheer terror the man
dropped his spear his right hand rose
from the girdle gripping a dagger curved
like a flame rose and sank into his
throat with the hilt of the dagger wedged
under his chin the tatar sagged to the
floor quivered and was still one blood-
stained hand had fallen among the chess-
men

  there was silence in the room for a
moment broken by toctamish the tatar
stepped to khlits side

  you and i are brothers cossack he
growled and your danger is my dan-
ger

  rashideddin who had given a sigh of
pleasure at the death of the attendant
studied the disordered chessmen impas-
sively the dai sprang to his feet with an
oath for several heart-beats no one
moved iba kabash stared in fascination
at a red pool which had formed under the
dead tatars head

vni

 the astrologer apparently giving
bmla lip as hopeless the attempt to re-
place the chessmen stood up and
khlit who was watching wondered at his
figure the man was bent so that his back
was in the form of a bow his head stuck
forward pale as a fishs belly topped by
the red skullcap his gray cloak came to
the ground yet when he moved it was
with a soft quickness

  you see he said as if nothing had
happened the oath of alamut-obedience
and-

  he stirred the shroud contemptuously
with his foot then as if arriving at a
decision he turned to iba kabash

  take these clowns to the banquet-place
and give them food see that they are
not harmed

  with that he motioned to the dai and
retreated through one of the recesses
toctamish wiped his brow on which the
perspiration had gathered and touched the
dead man with his foot

  the good rashideddin will not kill you
chanted the kurd eagerly it must be
a miracle for you are both fools you have
me to thank for your safety i have given
good advice have i not

  toctamish eyed him dubiously he did
not feel oversure of safety khlit how-
ever whispered to him rashideddin was
not the man to play with them if he desired
their death it might be that the astrol-
ogers words were in good faith-khlit
learned later that the latter never troubled
to lie-and if so they would gain nothing
and lose much by staying where they
were

  so it happened that both warriors
sheathed their swords with apparent good
grace and followed iba kabash who led
them through empty rooms until they came
out on a balcony overlooking the banquet-
place of alamut and khlit was little
prepared for what he saw now

  the warm wind touched their faces again
iba kabash pointed up in the center of
the lofty ceiling of the place a square open-
ing let in the starlight a crescent moon
added to the light which threw a silver sheen
over the great floor of the hall toctamish
grunted in surprise

  at first it seemed as if they were looking
on the camp of an army from a hillside
alamut



 dozens of fires smoldered on the floor
 below them and a hundred oil lamps
 sprinkled the intervening space about
 the lamps men were lying around small
 tables on which fruit wine and dishes
 massed a buzz of voices echoed down
 the hall and khlit was reminded of bees
 stirring about the surface of a hive

   the sound of eating and drinking
 drowned the noise of voices along the
 stone balcony where they stood other
 tables were placed with lamps numerous
 dark figures carried food and drink to these
 h and carried away the refuse left at other
 tables

    slaves said the kurd captives of
 the refik let us find a table and eat
 it is a lucky night that i met you for i
 shall go into the paradise of alamut

    khlit paid little attention to the last
  phrase later he was to remember it
  being very hungry he sat down with
  toctamish at a convenient table and took
  some of the bread and roasted meat which
  he found there toctamish was less re-
  strained and gulped down everything with
  zest

   as he ate khlit considered his com-
 panions and the banquet-place all of
 them he noticed seemed drowsy as if
 drunk or very gay in the lamplight
 their faces showed white they lay in
 heaps about the tables sometimes one on
 the other

    to the cossack drunkenness was no sin
  yet there was something about the white
  faces and limp figures of the men that
  stirred his blood and the smell of the
  place was unpleasant a damp musky odor
  seemed to rise from the hall under them
  as of beasts piles of fruit lay rotting
  about the floor

    it is time chattered the kurd who
 was sipping at a goblet of wine halen ibn
 shaddah showed himself he comes to
 the banquet-place every night and we
 drink to him drink khlit-are not
 cossacks born with a grape in their mouths
 you are lucky to be alive for rashideddin
 is a viper without mercy

    who is this rashideddin asked khlit
  setting down the wine for it was not to his
  liking

    oh he is the wise man of the arch-
 prophet-the master of alamut he knows
 more magic than all the greeks and der-
 vishes put together he reads the stars

and tells our master when it is time to send
out expeditions they say he has servants
in every city of the world but i think
he learns everything from the magic
sands iba kabashs tongue was out-
stripping his wit there is nothing that
goes on in persia and tartary that he
does not see how did he know you wore
a cross

  he saw the chain at my neck fool
retorted khlit

  he began to feel strangely elated he
had had only a little wine but his head was
whirling and he had a curious languor in
his limbs the trouble extended to his
eyes for as he looked at the banquet-place
it seemed to have grown wider and lighter
he could see that toctamish was half-
unconscious

  thus it was that khlit the wolf in the
banquet-place of alamut came under the
influence of the strange evil that gripped
the place and came to know of the great
wickedness which set alamut apart from
the world as with a curse

  khlit turning the situation over in his
mind saw that it was best to play the part
he had taken on himself he doubted if
it were possible to escape past the guards
by the river stairway even if he could free
himself from the guardianship of iba
kabash rashideddin he felt had not
left his visitors unwatched also he was
curious to see further of the strange world
of alamut which was a riddle of which he
had not found the key he had seen a
tatar kill himself at a word from the
astrologer and iba kabash who was a man
without honor speak with awe of the master
of alamut who was halen ibn shaddah
and what was his power over the men of
alamut

  as it happened it was not long before
khlit saw die man he was seeking and
whom he was sworn to kill there came
a pause in the murmur of talk and iba
kabash clutched his shoulder

  look he whispered here is sheik
halen ibn shaddah who will choose those
to go into paradise tonight you are new-
comers in alamut and he may choose you
whereon i shall follow behind without
being seen pray that his eye may fall on
us for few go to paradise

  across the banquet-place on the stone
balcony khlit saw a group of torches
the bearers were dais in the center of


adventure

the torches stood a tall man dressed as the
dais except that he wore no turban a cloak
covering his head drawn down so that
nothing could be seen of his face the
sheiks shoulders were very broad and the
hands that rested on his girdle were
heavy

  as khlit watched halen ibn shaddah
moved along the balcony among the eaters
on the banquet floor a murmur grew into
a shout-

  blessed be he that has unmade all laws
who is master of the akd chief of chief
prophet of prophets sheik of sheiks who
holds the keys of the gate of paradise

  iba kabash shouted as if in ecstacy
rising on his knees and beating his palms
together as the group of the sheik came
nearer them once or twice khlit saw
halen ibn shaddah beckon to a man who
rose hastily and followed the dais iba
kabash he thought was drunk yet not
in a fashion known to cossacks klilit
himself felt drowsy although clear in mind
he saw that the noise had wakened toc-
tamish who was swaying on his haunches
and muttering

  halen ibn shaddah stood over them
and khlit thought that one of the dais
whispered to him the cossack had fast-
ened his gaze greedily on the cloaked face
for he wished to see the face of the master
of alamut he could make out only a
round dark countenance and eyes that
showed much white vaguely he remem-
bered that he had seen others who had
faces like that but he could not think who
they were the sight of halen ibn shaddah
affected him like the foul smell of the
banquet-place and the rat-eyes of iba
kabash halen ibn shaddah beckoned to
him and toctamish

  klilit supported his companion to his feet
but found that the wine had taken away
all his own strength hands belonging
he suspected to slaves helped him after the
white  figures of the dais they passed
from the banquet-place through passages
that he could see only dimly the torch-
light vanished and there came a silence
which was broken by music very sweet
khlits head was swimming strangely
and he felt himself moving forward through
darkness darkness in which the music
echoed being repeated softly as he had
heard the voices repeated when they first
came into the passages of alamut

         ix

if it was a dream klilit asked
himself why should he be able to
taste the red wine that trinkled
down his throat yet if it were not a
dream why should a torrent of the red
wine issue from a rock and sunlight
burn on the red current when klilit was in
the passages of alamut under the ground

  truly it must be a dream he thought
it seemed that he was lying on his side
near the flowing wine with the sun warm
on his face whenever he wanted to drink
he did not need to sit up for he raised his
hand and a girl with flowers around her
head and breast came and filled some
vessel which she held out to him khlit
was very thirsty and the wine was good

  the girl he felt sat by him and her
finger-nails and the soles of her bare feet
were red he had never seen such a
maiden for her hair also was red and the
sun glinted through it as she drew it across
his face her hair must be perfumed he
thought like the harlots of samarkand for
it smelled very good

  the music came to his ears from time to
time and he snorted for khlit was no lover
of soft sounds neither did he fully relish
the wine which was oversweet he was
well content to be in the sun and too
drowsy to wonder how it happened

  the dream if it was that changed and
khlit was in a boat lying on some rugs
the boat was drifting along a canal from
time to tune it would pass under a porcelain
kiosk tasselled and inlaid with ivory
from these kiosks girls laughed down at him
and threw flowers one of the tinted faces
was like bereas and klilit thought then it
was surely a dream

  one other thing he remembered it was
in a grove of date trees where young boys
ran shouting and pelted each other with
fruit in spite of the warmth and pleasant-
ness khlit felt very tired he was in the
shade of one of the date trees with his sword
across his knees the music was very
faint here for which he was glad he
seemed very wakeful the air was clear
and looking up he could see the sky be-
tween jagged walls of stone he had seen
other walls of stone like these that was
when he and toctamish had stood at the
shahrud looking up at the dog rock that
was alamut
alamut



  even in the dream khlit felt ill he
saw the damsel of the red hair and flowers
and beckoned to her for he was thirsty
she ran away probably at the sight of his
sword khlit felt angry for she had given
him drink for what seemed many years

  then he saw the gray-cloaked figure of
rashideddin the astrologer of alamut
beside him and the white face stared at
him until khlit fidgeted he heard rashid-
eddin speak very faintly

  where art thou

  khlit was too tired to answer at first

  i know not he said finally

  thou art in paradise and by favor of
halen ibn shaddah do not forget
truly khlit had not forgotten there
were other things he remembered vistas
of blue pools where dark-skinned men
bathed and date groves where bright-
colored birds walked dragging their tails
on tije ground he saw girls pass hand in
hand singing and the music did not
cease

  if it had been a dream khlit said to
himself how could the taste of the strange
wine stick to his palate or the warmth
of the sun be still burning on his skin
nay surely it must have been a dream
and the waking was disagreeable

  the place where he found himself on
waking was dark wet and smelled strongly
of wine dregs khlit rose to his knees
cautiously and felt about him with his hand
he could feel the outline of something round
and moist on all sides except overhead
also he came upon the body of a man lying
by him which he identified by its fur tunic
and peaked helmet as toctamish the
tatar was snoring heavily

  wake flat-face and son of an unclean
animal he growled shaking him we
are no longer in paradise devil take me
if it aint a wine cask

  toctamish roused at length and sat up
reluctantly

  is it you caphar he asked stretching
himself many times have i been drunk
as an ox but never such as this may the
devil bite me if there was ever such wine
let us find some more

  then you have been dreaming also
meditated khlit did you imagine that
you saw berea

  berea nay but she said that she
would visit us here that was no dream
caphar for there was sunlight and much

feasting did rashideddin tell you it was
paradise i met other tatars there they
told me what it was

 were they also men who dishonored
their god at rashideddins bidding what
said they concerning this paradise of
yours

 toctamish snarled in anger at the
memory of the scene by the chessboard

  you are one without brains cossack
and it is well that we are here alive my
companions said this that all who came to
alamut were admitted to the paradise by
halen ibn shaddah if they were worthy
then if they were killed in the ranks of
the rejik their souls returned to the para-
dise that was a lie for how can there be
a soul in a man

  khlit said nothing but he thought that
he had found the key to the riddle halen
ibn shaddahs power lay in the lusts of his
men they looked on him even so shrewd
a man as iba kabash as one who held the
secret of paradise and although he did
not know it khlits thought had come near
to the evil of alamut which was a plague
spot on the face of the world

x

in the next few days the two
warriors bound together by mutual
interest although cordially hating
each other made frequent explorations of
the chambers of alamut in the daytime
sunlight filtered in at the banquet-place
the round chamber of rashideddin and
other places but at night the only light
was from lamps or torches the chambers
were large enough to hold a hundred men
in each and there were many khlit who
had keen eyes learned several things in-
cluding the place of the refik treasure

  first a certain area was guarded against
intrusion by picked tatars and arabs
into the guarded chambers he had seen
dais and other higher dignitaries called
dailkebirs go and he guessed they were
occupied by halen ibn shaddah and his
court where was kept the gold that flowed
into alamut as tribute money

  also there was no exit from the chambers
of alamut save by way of the stairway
and the river which was guarded fre-
quently armed bands went in and out also
messengers of many races but all were
closely watched moreover few except old


adventure

residents of the place like iba kabash the
kurd knew the way to the river stairway

  the slaves he learned brought food not
from the river stairway but another source
also wood for the fires the warriors of
alamut fedavie as they were called lived
as they chose under the eyes of the dais
ornamenting their quarters with spoil taken
in raids or from caravans each man was
richly decked in whatever suited his fancy
of silks or jewels the dais who com-
manded them took interest in them only
when it was time to take an expedition out
of alamut

  so much khlit saw and more he learned
from the talkative iba kabash who had
won some gold at dice from toctamish and
was inclined to be friendly the slaves
he said brought the food from the side of
alamut away from the river where they
drew it up in baskets to the summit of a
wall that barred all egress from the citadel

  iba kabash had not been beyond the
walls of alamut since his entry yet he had
heard much of the empire of the refik that
stretched its power from semarkand to
aleppo and from astrakan to basra the
murderers of the refik were feared so
greatly he explained that tribute was
paid by the cities to alamut questioned
by khlit he admitted that in numbers
any of the califates were superior to alamut
the power of halen ibn shaddah lay in the
daggers of his men no enemy escaped
assassination once he was marked and
many were marked

  then there is no way to leave save by
the river stair asked khlit who had
listened attentively

  iba kabash stared and shook his head

  where is the fool who would escape
khlit he responded thrice lucky are
we who are here there was a calif who
marched against us with horsemen from
irak we rained down stones and baked
clay on his men then sallied forth and the
shadrud was red with blood

  aye said toctamish sullenly there
are no better fighters than those of irak
remember hulaga khan and his horse-
men

  nay i knew them not

  iba kabash glanced at the tatar curi-
ously and khlit laughed to distract his
mind for he did not trust the kurd

  there was another who opposed us
continued iba kabash that was a sheik

of the hillmen in the mountains around
alamut him we killed by tearing out
his belly and bowels he had a daughter
who was a spit-fire rashideddin dealt
with her

  how asked khlit carelessly recog-
nizing the description as berea

  cleverly very cleverly chuckled the
kurd rubbing his hands together he
had halen ibn shaddah order her off to
marry some tatar chief who knew her not
it was when she had gone that we slew the
old chief slowly and scattered his tribe
truly a shrewd trick khlit gave
toctamish a warning blow in the ribs that
made the stocky warrior grunt how
fared the chiefs daughter at the hands of
the tatar your knowledge is greater
than that of others iba kabash can you
tell me that

  nay that is a hard one laughed the
kurd i have heard from a slave that
the chiefs daughter berea was seen in
astrakan also that she was taken as a
slave by some caravan not far from here
i know not

  was the one who told you a slave in
alamut demanded toctamish who was
becoming restive

  where else offspring of a donkey
muttered iba kabash i suppose you will
also ask how he came to hear of the girl
nay interrupted khlit toctamish
wondered at the power of alamut he is a
clown you and i iba kabash are men
of wisdom

  so it happened that khlit was not aston-
ished when as he came from the floor of the
banquet-place one night his head hazy
with the fumes of the strange wine a girl
slave leaned close to him and whispered
briefly

  by the far corner of the balcony she
repeated in an hour

  he looked thoughtfully at an object the
slave had thrust into his hand it was the
sapphire which berea had once offered him

  he did not tell toctamish of the message
and he was at some pains to get rid of
iba kabash before the time appointed in
the message so he was alone when he
went slowly along the stone balcony to a
dark corner the slaves had retired from
the banquet-place and the fedavie were
watching for halen ibn shaddah to come
from his quarters standing so that he
could not be seen by those below khlit
alamut



waited waited until the torches came
with the dais and the huge figure of halen
ibn shaddah he felt a touch on his coat
and turned

  follow whispered the soft voice of the
persian and do not tread clumsily

  khlit found that this was not so easy
berea carried no light he could barely
see her cloaked form by the reflection of an
occasional candle as she passed swiftly
through chambers and rock passages his
head was light from the wine although his
mind was clear

  berea kept to passages where there were
few persons and these khlit saw to be
slaves she was taking him through the
slave quarters where he had not been before
through corridors that narrowed until he
had to turn sideways to pass by sunken
walls which smelled evilly through a
corridor that led out of the chambers of
alamut into the paradise of halen ibn
shaddah

  klilit paused in amazement and felt of
his head which was throbbing a half-moon
glimmered down at him and a cofll night
wind played in his hair the branches of
date trees stirred lazily under his feet
he could feel grass and he saw one of the
strange birds that dragged its tail come
from the shadow of the date trees

  berea shook him angrily by the arm

  one without sense eater of swine flesh
she hissed are you a clown to gape at
strange things

a fountain threw its spray on
the wind into khlits face with a
scent like the roses of ispahan
below the fountain was a canal which
khlit remembered vaguely with a boat
attached to the shore in the water he
could see the reflection of the moon gleam-
ing at him and he was dizzy

  this is the paradise of halen ibn
shaddah he muttered unsteadily where
i came by his favor so rashideddin
told me

  berea peered up at him silently her
cloak fell back and khlit saw the dark
masses of hair which fell on either shoulder
and the white throat under the curved
dark mouth that was twisted in scorn

  a weak fool she stormed shaking him
toctamish is a better man than you

  toctamish is drunk nay little spar-
row it is my head it will be better pres-

ently this is no dream how did you
come to alamut little berea

  for answer the girl drew khlit who was
fighting the dizziness in his head to the
canal and into the boat pushing it from
the shore she paddled in the water until it
floated into the shadows not content with
this berea urged the craft along the bank
quietly and khlit who was flat on his back
saw the shadow of a bridge fall over them

  nay he said drowsily the stars are
good it is good to see them again
where are we now how did you bring
me here

  berea came and sat by khlits head
feeling his hot forehead with a small hand
she wrapped her thin cloak tightly about
her and rested her chin on her two hands
gazing at the round moon in the water

  a man must be crafty and wise she
repeated softly yet lo it is a weak girl
a creature of the false prophets paradise
who leads him they told me you were
very shrewd oh my abulfetlah harb issa
gray father of battles soon there will be
a great battle and the waters of shahrud
will be red again have you ever seen
wolves of the steppe tear jackals of the
mountains into bits foam-flecked have
you ever run with the pack of wolves oh
one called the wolf nay they have
clipped your fangs

  that is a lie sparrow growled khlit
surlily give me a horse and freedom to
swing a sword and i shall trounce some
of these evil fedavies for you bah it is a
hotbed of sin a reeking plague-house
show me the way out of alamut

  and your promise queried berea
to cut off the head of halen ibn shaddah
khlit was silent true he had promised
and was in honor bound to berea

  likewise berea he said moodily you
said that there was a plan why do you
keep the plan hidden in your mind if there
is one better be in good faith with me
say how halen ibn shaddah can be killed
how should i kill so strong a man she
laughed softly the koran reads that
allah weakens the stratagems of mis-
believers also that they who store up
evil shall taste what they store up such
are the words of wisdom despised by
rashideddin nay destruction shall come
upon alamut like the storm from a cloud
quick as poison from a serpents fang and
halen ibn shaddah-
 

adventure

  halen ibn shaddah chuckled khlit
is not easily to be found

  abruptly he gripped the girls wrist
beside the round orb of the moon in the
water he saw the reflection of a turbaned
man it was a stout man carrying a
sword as broad as a horses neck or the
reflection lied khlit rose on one elbow
fingering his saber at the same time the
boat moved backward silently under im-
pulse of the girls paddling and passed from
the bridge along the canal under date trees

  a eunuch one of the tribe who guard
the creatures of the paradise berea
whispered i have seen them often
because i am also a celestial houri-while
it pleases me i saw you when you came
here a few days ago listen- her voice
changed-for you must serve me and the
time is near

  khlit nodded the fresh night air had
cleared some of the poison from his brain

  i shall take you back to the chambers
of alamut khlit by way of the slaves
quarters we are on the top of alamut
now where halen ibn shaddah whom may
allah lay in the dust has built an evil
paradise on the ruins of the old citadel to
beguile his men verily what they have
made-he and rashideddin-is a magicians
trick the men who come here are drugged
with a strange poison that i know not i
have tasted it in the wine-may allah grant
me mercy-and it is evil

  khlit grunted in assent

  it is some secret of rashideddins she
resumed the fedavie are foul with it
until they lose fear of death this drug
chains them to halen ibn shaddah that
and their lusts and they have chained
others by fear of the refik yet their doom
is near it is coming from there- point-
ing in the direction which khlit thought to
be north-and it is swift as the hunting
falcon on the wing

  another riddle berea muttered khlit
where have you seen a falcon

  where you have seen them cossack
she laughed and toctamish has hunted
with them where swords are sharpened
for the cutting down of the fedavie in the
land of the kallmark tatars north of the
salt sea oh the doom of alamut will
be very great and munkir and nakir the
dark angels that flay dead men in their
graves will grow big with power
another riddle little berea it is many

generations since tatar horsemen rode into
persia for conquest

  the answer is under your blind eyes
father of battles am i not beautiful as
the rose garden of tiflis in spring is not
my hair dark as the mantle of melik and
my skin white as aloes under the dew
berea moved her perfumed head close to
khlit and the cossack drew away nay
others have eyes so allah has willed that
my honor shall be cleared and the doom of
alamut shall come

  the tatars are marching on alamut
khlit bit his mustache in glee devil take

me that is good news-

  hush fool berea drew in her breath
eagerly twenty thousand horsemen are
riding along the salt sea toward alamut
they will not stop to plunder or gather
spoil oh it will be a good battle my
father shall see it from the footstool of
mohammed aye it will gladden his eyes
i shall open the gate of alamut to twenty
thousand kallmark horsemen the gate
that leads to the banquet-place where
i bring food every night with the slaves
here is what you must do father of

battles-

  she listened intently for a moment
the paradise of halen ibn shaddah was
still and only the birds with long tails
moved

  on the third night father of battles
she whispered the dai who is in command
at the river stair will change his sentries
at the second watch do you and toc-
tamish get among the sentries of the river
gate i have seen you with iba kabash
who is one without honor pay him and it
may be done two sentries are as is the
custom in the river outside the gate on
the third night those two must be you and
toctamish none other that is your task
then will you have a horse to ride you and
toctamish meanwhile keep out of sight

of rashideddin-

  aye said khlit pondering rashid-
eddin

xi

it is written in the annals of
abulghazi that as the year of the
lion drew to its close very great
riches came to the treasury of halen ibn
shaddah from the cities which lived in the
shadow of fear save from the north by
the salt sea where the tithes came not
alamut



nor any riders and in the north said
abulghazi a storm was gathering swift
as wind rolling up all in its path yet no
murmur of the storm came to alamut to
the man who named himself prophet of
god to the banquet-place of the fedavie to
the man of wisdom rashideddin

  it was the second day after the visit of
berea that khlit who had been thinking
deeply sought out iba kabash where the
kurd lay sleeping on the floor of the
banquet-place and roused him from his
stupor

  i have news for the ear of halen ibn
shaddah himself he said squatting and
lighting his pipe none other he will
surely reward me

  iba kabash ceased yawning and into his
lined face came the look of a crafty fox

  halen ibn shaddah will not see you
khlit he will see nobody except a few
old fellows of alamut of whom i am one
verily i have the ear of the master of
alamut tell me your message and i will
give it for you are a man of brains you
klilit are of the chosen the others are
ones without understanding

  khlit knew that iba kabash lied for the
most part he considered his pipe gravely
and shook his head

  my news is not to be repeated halen
ibn shaddah would pay a good price how
can you get such a good price for it as i
nay remonstrated the kurd i shall
get a better price for i know well the
value of news tell me and we shall both
profit you and i

  khlit grinned under his mustache for a
while he played with the skill of one who
understood the game well with the growing
inquisitiveness of his companion iba ka-
bash steadily raised the reward he assured
khlit as he sensed the interest of the
cossack

  then stated khlit slowly you will
do this you will go direct to the master
of alamut and tell him my news to no
other for here a man takes what credit
he can and as the price of the good you
will get for the telling you will aid me in
the plan i have the plan concerns a girl
that halen ibn shaddah would give a finger
of his left hand to see brought before him
i swear it -said the kurd readily on
my ahd the oath of a fedavie now tell me
the news and it shall go to halen ibn
shaddah as you have said

  khlit nodded that much the kurd
would do he was sure whether iba
kabash would tell the source of his message
was dubious khlit felt in his heart that
if the news was important iba kabash
would keep the credit for himself which
was what khlit wanted

  tell halen ibn shaddah this he said
slowly that khlit the cossack called the
wolf has learned that berea the persian
girl who was sent from rudbar by rashid-
eddin has returned and is in alamut
he will be very curious say no more
for you and i iba kabash can find the
girl and take her to him if you help me
it can be managed that is my message

  khlit watched the kurd depart nimbly
iba kabash had sensed the importance of
the cossacks words it would be a rare
tale to pour into the ears of the master of
alamut and nimbly as the kurd took
his way from the banquet-place khlit was
as quick to follow keeping in the shadows of
the passages but well within sight of the
other

  so it happened that iba kabash did not
see khlit when he turned into the winding
stair that led to the room of rashideddin
but the cossack saw him and waited by the
outer chamber if iba kabash had looked
behind he might not have gone where he
did yet he did not look behind and khlit
waited patiently

  presently one of the khirghiz men came
from the winding stair walking idly and
khlit halted him asking if the khirghiz
had seen aught of a certain kurd called iba
kabash

  the man had seen him iba kabash
had come to the astrologers chamber of
a certainty he had spoken to rashideddin
why else had he come was the astrologer
one to stare at they had talked together
and he had not heard what was said
although he listened carefully for it was in
another tongue

  rashideddin swore khlit was a man to
be feared doubtless he was the one that
spoke most often to halen ibn shaddah
the holy prophet nay he surely had the
ear of halen ibn shaddah who held the keys
to the blessed paradise

  the khirghiz swore even more fluently
it was a lie that rashideddin spoke with
halen ibn shaddah more than others
rashideddin was favored by the dark
powers for he read books the khirghiz


adventure

knew that for he was one of the chosen
fedavie of the astrologer

  khlit turned at a step on the stair
instead of rashideddin he saw the stout
figure of iba kabash who halted in sur-
prise

  listen cossack the kurd whispered
with a glance around the chamber i
have not yet delivered your message for
rashideddin stopped me on my way to
halen ibn shaddah and ordered me to
bring you to him but do not tell rashid-
eddin what you know i shall see that
you get a good reward i swear it we must
try to get the girl if you know a way tell
me and it shall be done remember say
nothing to rashideddin

  khlit weighed the words of the kurd for
their gist of truth and foimd very little
he little liked to face the astrologer but he
ascended the stair at once swaggering and
stamping his boots

  in the round chamber of the astrologer
he halted it was night and candles were
lighted around the tapestried walls rashid-
eddin was crouched over rolls of parch-
ment and instruments the like of which
khlit had not seen in a cleared space on
the floor in front of him the wise man of
alamut had ranged a number of images
silver and cleverly wrought of stars

  the stars formed a circle and in the circle
was a bag rashideddin sat quietly arms
crossed on knees staring in front of him
around the walls of the chamber silk hang-
ings had been placed on which were woven
pictures of scenes which khlit recognized
as belonging to the paradise of halen ibn
shaddah

  seat yourself cossack said rashid-
eddin in his slow deep voice in front of
me and watch

wjijp the astrologers eyes were half-
closed looking into them khlit
could see nothing the room was
still and deserted except for the two khlit
wished that others had been there he felt
ill at ease and sucked at his pipe loudly

  in the place of darkness of the spirit
munkir said rashideddin there are no
stars yet when men are alive they can
look on the stars few can read them
from alamut i have seen them and
learned many things do they read the
stars in your country cossack

  nay said khlit we know them not

  rashideddin contemplated his circle
thoughtfully his hands yellow and very
clean took up a pair of dividers with which
he measured the distance between the silver
stars

  in the heart of alamut we have burned
the law books of the persians and the code
books of the medes they were very old
yet is the dust of age a sacrament what
is there about an old law that makes it
graven as on stone in the minds of men
one prophet has said that he who takes a
tooth for a tooth is lawful another has said
that he who injures another for his own sake
shall suffer greatly which is the truth

  nay answered khlit i know not

  it was written that when one man kills
another the kin of that man shall kill the
first so i have seen many in the world
outside alamut kill each other without
cause yet in alamut we kill only for a
reason

  khlit thought of the dead tatar who had
fallen where rashideddin sat and was silent

  watch said the astrologer putting
aside his dividers he took up the bag
opening the top of this slightly he held it
over the circle in both hands tipping it
to one side he allowed a thin stream of sand
to fall in the space enclosed by the stars
the sand heaped itself in moimds which
rashideddin considered carefully setting
down the bag

  there are laws in the stars cossack
he repeated tracing idly in the sand with
his dividers and i have read them is
it not true that when a man has found the
sum of wisdom he has none the poet
has said that no beauty is in the world save
that of power over other men the stars
watch the evil and idleness of men one
who reads them learns many things i
shall tell you what i learned of you cos-
sack

  aye said khlit grimly tell

  under the cover of his bushy eyebrows
he studied his companion rashideddin
was a magician and in khlits mind a
magician was not to be trusted was the
astrologer playing with him using him as a
chess-player moves a piece on the board
what had iba kabash told rashideddin
khlit waited paying no attention to the
stars or the sand watching only the eyes of
the other

  from the land of ukraine you came
khlit said the astrologer alone and
alamut



met toctamish in astrakan when the
wolf runs with the jackal over the steppe
the stars have a riddle to solve perhaps
the wolf is hungry and the jackal is
useful

  aye said khlit iba kabash

  rashideddins expression did not change
as he stirred the sands with his dividers
at astrakan there was a fedavie who is
dead you and the jackal toctamish were
under his roof you came with him to a
ship and the fedavie was slain aye the
wolf was hungered much have i learned
from the stars there was a girl with you
on the ship she did not come with you to
alamut

  khlit made no response and rashideddin
continued to stir the sands

  the girl was not one easy to forget
you have not forgotten her the jackal is
drunk but you have an ear for wisdom
the girl might be found in alamut aye
by one who knows her in the thousands of
slaves

  khlit shook the ashes from his pipe
out of the corner of his eye he saw the
hangings move behind him well he knew
the chamber of rashideddin was pregnant
with danger the pallid astrologer toyed
with mens lives as he did with the magic
sands he made no move waiting for
what was to come

  it came in a blinding flash a burst of
flame and the sands leaped upward
smoke and a wrenching smell filled
khlits eyes and throat the skin of his
face burned hotly blinking and gasping
he rocked back on his haunches

  the wolf is wise -in the ways of the
steppe purred the astrologer yet he
came to alamut the vultures nest it is
a pity the girl too is missing perhaps
she can be found

  the face of rashideddin stared at him
through thinning clouds of powder smoke
and khlit wiped the tears of pain from his
eyes rapidly he thought rashideddin
wanted berea halen ibn shaddah would
pay a high price for the girl who was dan-
gerous being not as other girls

  aye he muttered coughing for the
flame had burned his face she may be
found

  tomorrow there will be an audience by
halen ibn shaddah for the fedavie she
will be there i shall send for you before
evening fail and the fedavie will break

your bones slowly with stones or tear the
skin from your back

  khlit rose to his feet without obeisance
have the stars he asked any other
message for me

  for a long moment rashideddin studied
him through narrowed lids idly the
dividers traced patterns in the powder ash
in the circle of stars and khlit cursed
himself softly for in the eyes of the other
was the look of one who measures swords
once too often he had drawn the attention
of the astrologer on himself

  dismissed from the round chamber khlit
sought out iba kabash and secured the
promise of the kurd that he would be put
with toctamish among the sentries for the
next night for being admitted to the para-
dise of alamut this was their privilege
to gain this point it was necessary to
assure the kurd that berea could be
found once more iba kabash swore khlit
would get a good price whereupon khlit
had the thought that the other was too glib
with a promise

  then he found toctamish and told the
tatar enough of what had passed in the
garden of halen ibn shaddah to keep him
sober overnight this done khlit seated
himself in a comer of the banquet-place
and took out his sword placing it across
his knees he began to whet it with the stone
he always carried as he did so men near
him stared curiously for khlit was singing
to himself in a voice without music

  and rashideddin sat over the circle of
silver stars tracing and retracing patterns
in the ashes of powder with the look of one
in whose soul there is no peace

v xn

came the time of the divan the
assembly of the refik and closed
gates that guarded the apartments
of halen ibn shaddah in the cellars of
alamut swung open in poured the fol-
lowers of the refik fedavie hillmen of
persia men of the khirghiz steppe janis-
saries of yussouf prince of princes scat-
tered in the crowd were magicians of
rashideddin in white tunics and red girdles
in company with white and gold dais
also came khlit with the khirghiz chief
who had seen fit to keep at his side

the throng moved in silence and khlit
waxed curious at this until he questioned


adventure

the khirghiz for reply he received a hard
blow in the ribs

  you are surely a fool cossack growled
the other to bray at what is strange we
are walking through the talking chambers
of the shadna built by ala-eddin
harken he lifted his voice in a shrill
syllable aie

  instantly the sound was taken up and
repeated through the corridors a hun-
dred echoes caught the word and flung it
back shrilly gruffly it rang further into
the caverns men near them stared and
cursed khlit observed that the corridors
were lofty and vaulted with pillars of stone

  it is said whispered the khirghiz
gratified by the effect of his experiment
that before the time of rashideddin when
the refik prayed to allah these were the
chambers of prayer a man could pray a
thousand times with ne word

  and now

  we do not pray

  pushing a way through the crowd reck-
lessly witii his elbows the khirghiz gained
a place where he and khlit could see the
array of the divan in the center of a
cleared space in one of the larger chambers
stood halen ibn shaddah easily marked
by his great height and the cloak that
shadowed his face around him were
grouped certain men in heavy turbans and
green embroidered coats these khlit
recognized as daikebirs emissaries of the
master of alamut at his side was the
bent figure of rashideddin

  these were talking in a tongue that
khlit did not know not loudly for fear of
disturbing the echoes his eye wandered
over the throng wandered and halted
a womans figure stood out from the crowd
and he swore under his breath arms
length from rashideddin among the dais
her blue cloak closely wrapped on her
slender form stood berea her black curls
were pushed under a fold of the cloak her
brown eyes darting from under fringed
lashes swept about the gathered refik and
passed khlit by in unconcern yet he felt
that she had seen him

  no other woman was present khlit
saw that the eyes of many searched her
and he touched the khirghiz on the
shoulder

  is there talk about the woman he
asked softly tell me

  the chief listened tolerantly for a space

  aye he said there is idle talk the
woman is the daughter of a hill sheik she
was sent to be the wife of kiragai khan
that is a good jest for kiragai khan loves
not the refik she has said that she was
sent without a dowry so the painted
flower has come to one who tramples on
flowers to ask that the dowry be given
her

  and will it be done

  will the tiger give up its slain victim
nay you are without understanding cos-
sack halen ibn shaddah does not play
with such the sheiks daughter will find a
place among the slaves not otherwise
such is not the law

  there is no law in alamut but one-the
word of halen ibn shaddah and the law
that the curved dagger must avenge a
wrong

  khlit made no reply considering carefully
what had been said rashideddin then
had found berea as he had declared he
would was it bereas purpose to come
before halen ibn shaddah had she for-
gotten the cunning and cruelty of the man
who had dishonored her perhaps the
girls pride had impelled her to appeal for
justice and a wedding dowry to give the
khan to whom she had offered herself
yet berea had not forgotten the manner
of her fathers death of that khlit was
sure wise in the ways of men the heart
of the sheiks daughter was a closed book
to him he looked around for toctamish
the tatar was not to be seen

  meanwhile rashideddin had been speak-
ing to the girl

  what said the astrologer asked khlit
the old one is crafty grunted the
khirghiz aye he has learned the secrets
of magic where marduk hangs by his heels
in the hell of babylon he asked why a girl
so fair in face and form should bear a gift
in offering herself in marriage

  berea who seemed to ignore her peril
lifted her dark head and answered quickly
in tones that stirred the echoes

  hah the painted flower has a sharp
tongue grunted the chieftain she says
that her beauty has moved the heart of
kiragai khan as wind stirs fire the khan
who desires her would have taken her for
his favorite wife yet would she not being
ashamed for reason of the trick halen ibn
shaddah played her so she has come
back to ask a dowry from the hand of the
alamut



master of alamut who is her lawful ruler
now that her father is dead

  the giant form of halen ibn shaddah
turned on berea and a peculiarly shrill
voice reached the ears of khlit once more
he wondered what kind of man was the mas-
ter of alamut of the giant figure and shrill
voice

  halen ibn shaddah says whispered
the other that berea belongs to alamut
she has returned to alamut and here she
must stay

  klilit thought of the paradise of the
master of evil and understood why the eyes
of the fedavie in the throng burned as they
stared at the girls slender figure outlined in
the blue cloak

  she asked for justice- he began

  nay interrupted the khirghiz care-
lessly her father was slain by halen ibn
shaddah how is she then to be trusted

  khlit did not answer for the gaze of
berea had met his in it he read anxiety
and a warning slowly her glance crept
to rashideddin and back again and
khlit saw the astrologer turn to leave the
chamber

  truly he considered the sheiks daughter
was daring and proud and obeying her
look he followed rashideddin slipping
away from the khirghiz

  so it happened that when the astrologer
left the divan khlit did likewise rashid-
eddin made his way quickly and alone
down one of the corridors without waiting
for a light khlit followed him keeping
as close as he could without being seen
presently both halted

  a voice called through the corridor
clearly and seemingly very near

  a man must be crafty and wise the
voice of berea came to their ears when
danger is round ills path else is his labor
vain

  khlit crossed himself in astonishment
for a moment he had forgotten the echoes
of the corridors of ala-eddin

xiv

rashideddin went straight to
the winding stairs that led to his own
apartment at the foot of these
stairs khlit who had traced the astrologer
closely paused it would not be easy to
go farther without being seen and this
khlit wanted to avoid he believed that

rashideddin was having him watched and
that the khirghiz had attended him to the
divan under orders and at all costs he
must be free to act that night

  rashideddin thought khlit sensed
something impending in some way the
magician of alamut kept himself informed
of what went on in the citadel his spies
were everywhere and on the night when
berea planned to admit the enemies of the
refik both were under watch where was
toctamish

  khlit wasted no time by the foot of the
winding stair there were other entrances
to the circular chamber where rashideddin
kept his henchmen and the cossack cast
about until he came to one of these a
passage led upward unlighted in the
direction he sought and this khlit followed
until he came to a curtain which he sus-
pected divided it from the chamber of the
astrologer beyond the curtain he could
hear voices

  lifting one edge of the hanging klilit
looked out cautiously candle-light in the
chamber dazzled him for a moment he
made out a dozen figures rashideddin not
among them dressed in the red and white
pf the magicians cult they were grouped
around a man prone on the floor this
man was toctamish

  the tatars coat and shirt had been
removed two fedavie held each of his
arms outstretched on the floor his thick
chest was strangely red and he gasped as
if in pain not once or twice but long
broken gasps that shook his body

  as klilit watched startled one of the
fedavie a gaunt tatar with a pocked face
placed some brown dust on the chest of the
prostrate man khlit recognized the dust
it was the same that had singed his face
when he sat opposite rashideddin

  thrusting aside the hanging klilit
stepped into the room the fedavie took
no notice of him believing that he was
one of rashideddins henchmen stationed
in the passage toctamish however lifted
his eyes which gleamed as they fell on the
cossack khlit saw that his brow was
covered with sweat and that blood ran
from his mouth

  the man of the pitted face lifted some
brown powder and sifted it on the chest of
his victim another pushed a torch into
his hand khlit realized then how his
companion was being tortured the smell

ifipbi

adventure

of burning in the air came from singed flesh
and toctamish was feeling the angry hand
of rashideddin

  khlit stepped to the side of the fedavie
with the torch and peered closely at toc-
tamish he saw then what made the
tatars chest red of a strange shade
strips of skin had been torn off over the
lungs and here the powder was laid
khlit swore and his hand strayed to his
sword and fell to his side the fedavie
numbered a full dozen armed and able-
bodied to draw his sword would be to
bring ten whirling around him

  khlit had no love for toctamish yet in
this room the other had stood with his
sword drawn beside him and they had
shared bread and salt toctamish was
standing the torture with the stark courage
which was his creed the lips of the
sufferer moved and khlit bent closer

  kiragai khan-khan of the horde
the cracked lips gasped tell him blood
for blood we have shared bread-and
salt and arak tell him

  the cossack nodded toctamish was
asking him to report how he had endured
torture to kiragai khan who was advancing
on alamut at the head of his men and
claiming vengeance he was weak and
seemed to have no hope of living

  what said the dog muttered the
fedavie with the torch who had been trying
to catch what toctamish whispered he
spoke in a bastard tatar with a strange
lisping he will not speak and rashid-
eddin has said that he must or we will
hang by the heels

  he is out of his mind answered khlit
carelessly what must he tell

  he stuck a dagger into a fedavie a
syrian on the shore of the salt sea a
girl berea the sheiks daughter was there
also this yellow-faced fool must tell if
the girl ordered him to do it bah his
skin is tough as oxen hide and his flesh is
senseless as swine

  and he has not spoken

  nay rashideddin was here and ques-
tioned him but the tatar cursed him
khlit scanned the face of toctamish
the yellow skin was dark and moist with
sweat the eyes were bloodshot and half-
closed the mouth lifted in a snarl dis-
closing teeth pointed as an animals he
felt that toctamish would not yield to the
torture and great love for the man

whose courage was proof against pain rose
in the heart of khlit whose own courage
was such that men called him the wolf
aye he growled blood for blood
that is the law of alamut and kiragai
khan shall know

  he saw by a quick opening of the eyes
that toctamish caught his words

  what say you queried the fedavie
kiragai khan

  toctamishs knotted figure writhed under
the hands of his captors he spat blood
and foam combined at the other

  aye he groaned kiragai khan-lord
of fifty thousand spears-chief of a hunched
ensigns-master of alamut

  he speaks interpreted khlit swiftly
of one hulagu khan who conquered
alamut tell rashideddin and cease
the torture for the man has nothing to
confess

  the fedavie stared at khlit suspiciously
nay he snarled shall we hang by
the heels

  he thrust the torch near the powder
there was a hissing flash a smell of burning
flesh toctamishs body quivered spas-
modically and sank back the eyes closed

  under cover of the flare and smoke khlit
slipped back through the circle and sought
the stair gaining this he did not pause
until he had reached the inner gate of the
underground citadel where a dai was
assembling his men to guard the outer gate
by the river

  when khlit who was nursing in his brain
the sight he had just left went down the
river stairs to his post in the river shahrud
he found that his companion was the
bearded khirghiz chieftain

  the outer post of the guard around the
citadel of alamut was in a small nest of
rocks several hundred paces from the
entrance and midway in the stream so
shallow was the river that they could wade
out to the rocks the khirghiz led the way

  it was not yet the middle of the night
and a bright moon lighted the winding
ribbon of the shahrud that twisted between
the rocky heights of rudbar the mass of
alamut showed dark giving no sign of the
evil world it concealed a wind from the
heights brushed khlits face and he breathed
it in deeply for he was nauseated by the
stench of the caverns

  you and i cossack said the khirghiz
seating himself unsteadily on a ledge of the
alamut

i

rocks for he had beeir drinking will keep
the outer post

  aye said khlit you and i

  he stared out into the moonlight haze
that hung over the river berea had said
that he and toctamish were to hold the
outer post from some quarter the horse-
men of kiragai khan were nearing the gate
of alamut khlit realized that unless the
attack came as a surprise the citadel was
impregnable a surprise might carry the
tatar horde into the entrance berea had
said there was a way and this was it
yet if a surprise was to succeed the
khirghiz must be disposed of he had
been drinking but he was still watchful
no movement of the cossack escaped him

  quietly khlit drew out a small vial
from this he poured a few grains of a while
powder into his hand lifting his hand he
made as if to take the powder into his
mouth the khirghiz bent forward and
his face lighted with evil desire

  have you- he began

  come brother whispered khlit geni-
ally we will be comfortable on the rocks
is not the bread of the refik the vintage of
the shadna to be eaten come

  the khirghiz swore softly and held out
his hand in wine and food the vintage of
the shadna was often in the hands of the
refik men but not except on expeditions
of the master of alamut or by costly
bribery of the dais was the pure powder of
hashish to be had the hashish that brought
bright dreams of paradise and lulled the
mind with pleasures that hardened the
souls of the men of alamut and steeled
their hands to the dagger

  khlit who had discovered the secret of
the drug through the babblings of iba
kabash quietly dropped his portion back
into the vial later he knew the khir-
ghiz would want more and he had but a
little

xiv

it was not long before khlit was
alone the khirghiz lay at his side
on the rocks muttering to himself
with enough hashish inside him to make an
imbecile of an ordinary man khlit sat
by his side saber across his knees and
watched the moonlit sides of the heights
that frowned down on him on the slopes
he could make out the shadowy outlines
of droves of horses and he wondered if the

dais were planning an expedition that
night

  usually khlit was not given to fore-
bodings yet the black mass of alamut
rising at his back gave him the feeling
of approaching danger and when he scanned
the shadows along the river they moved as
if filled with the bands of drug-crazed
fedavie especially khlit wondered if the
spies of rashideddin were watching him
rashideddin had learned of the murder of
the syrian had connected berea with it
and toctamish with berea toctamish at
his order had been tortured with such
devilish cruelty that even the tatars
fortitude might break down

  how much did the astrologer know of
bereas secret once the alarm was raised
in alamut a thousand swords would block
the stairs at the river gate and the rope
hoists of the slaves at the rear would be
drawn up there were no signs of activity
that khlit could see but few ever saw the
movements of the fedavie accustomed as
he was to war on the steppe he was skeptical
of horsemen taking such a stronghold as
alamut

  once the tatar horde forced the entrance
there would be a battle such as khlit had
never seen before himself a cossack he
cared little whether refik or khan were the
victor-except that he had sworn an oath
a double oath that the life of the master
of alamut halen ibn shaddah would fall
to his sword wherefore he waited pa-
tiently eyes searching the road by the river
where the invaders might come

  berea had told him that twenty thousand
tatars were riding through the hills to
alamut yet the road was narrow and
the way twisted it would be hard to move
quickly and there were the horse-tenders
on the hills who would give the alarm
khlit had come to grant a grudging admira-
tion to the sheiks daughter who had defied
halen ibn shaddah but she was in
rashideddins hands and the astrologer
was the man khlit had marked as most
dangerous of the refik

  rising suddenly khlit drew in his breath
sharply outlined against the summit of
a hill he saw a horse and rider moving very
swiftly the man was bent low in his
saddle and khlit thought he saw the long
cloak of the fedavie before the rider came
over the brow of the hill half-way down
the descent the horse stumbled and fell


adventure

  khlit saw a dark object shoot from the
rolling horse and lie passive clear in the
moonlight the messenger if such it was
of the fedavie would not reach his destina-
tion and at the same time khlit saw
something else before his eyes as if by
magic he beheld kiragai khan and thou-
sands of his horsemen

  then khlit surnamed the wolf buckled
tight his belt and drew on his sheepskin hat
firmly there was to be a battle that
would redden the waters of the shahrud
and among the swords of the fedavie halen
ibn shaddah was to be found

  apparently there was nothing stirring
on the mountain slopes of rudbar except
the shapes of the horse droves that drew
down to the river as was their custom
awaiting the bands of the dais which came
out for mounts tonight there were no
men issuing from alamut and it was only
when one of the herds moved across the face
of the moon that khlit saw the tips of tatar
helmets moving among the horses and
understood why the horses seemed more
numerous than before

  even as berea had promised the tatar
horde was approaching the gate of alamut
one of the herds reached the rivers edge
and pressed on in the shadow of the hill-
side khlit could see the faces of men
peering at him and catch the glint of their
spears he gave a hasty glance at his com-
panion the man was sleeping heavily

  familiar with the ways of the tatars the
cossack could guess how their whirlwind
rush into rudbar had cut off all news being
sent to the citadel and how after dark the
refik horse-tenders on the pastures had
been singled out and cut down one had
broken away with the news that was to
carry the doom of alamut only to fall by
the river

  the foremost warriors had reached him
clinging closely to the sides of their horses
a low voice called out to him cautiously

  you are the cossack who will guide us

  aye said khlit but the moon is
bright here and there are others within the
caverns are you ready to rush forward
at once

  lead said the voice and we will
follow lead us to the gate of alamut and
we will purge the devils hole of its filth

  khlit cast a quick glance at the hillsides
other bodies were moving down some
were nearly at the river thousands were

coming over the hillcrest more were
coming by the river road on the far
flanks detachments were moving to the rear
of alamut

  drawing his sword he sprang down into
the river and splashed toward the shore
dark forms closed in beside him and the
welcome stench of sweat and leather filled
his nose the river was full of moving
forms and horses that dashed riderless to
either side khlits heart leaped and his
clasp tightened on his sword one of the
foremost caught him roughly by the arm
khlit had a quick glimpse of a dark lined
face and flashing eyes

  i am kiragai khan cossack where
is toctamish he was to stay by the side
of berea

  she sent him to watch with me yet
very likely he is dead by now

  the other swore as they gained the
shelter of the caverns

  take me to her then he snarled

  so it happened that before the light of
day touched the date trees on the summit of
alamut citadel of the refik and place of
plague and evil the first of the horde that
had ridden from the shores of the salt sea
entered the river gate overcoming a few
guards forced their way up the stair and
spread through the passages of alamut
making no sound but silently as tigers
seeking their prey

xv

in the annals of abulghazi it is
written how in the year of the lion
came the doom of alamut the
refik folk were cornered in the cellars of
the citadel and taken by surprise the
swords of the kallmark tatars flashed in
the passages and their sharp arrows sped
through the corridors and as the proph-
ecy said the waters of the shadrud were red

  yet in the book of abulghazi and the
annals of the persian dynasties there is
nothing said of the fate of halen ibn
shaddah who was the last leader of the
refik the followers of kiragai khan
sought through alamut from the wine
chambers to the gardens among the ruins
on the summit and they did not find
halen ibn shaddah

  the battle was not over for many hours
separate bands of mounted tatars had
surrounded the height on which alamut


alamut



stood and when throngs of slaves and the
eunuchs with the houris of the gardens
swept out from hidden tunnels and were
lowered over the wall they were cut down
they were not spared for that was the
word of kiragai khan the fedavie cor-
nered and led by their dais rallied and
attacked the columns of invaders which
were penetrating to the heart of alamut

  the tatars without their horses and
fighting in the gloom of the caverns were
at a disadvantage which was offset by
greater numbers and the leadership of
kiragai khan for the fedavie had no
leader messengers who sought through
the tapestried apartments of the shadna
for halen ibn shaddah found none but
panic-struck daikebirs the tide of battle
flung the fedavie back to the banquet-place
and to the treasure-house beyond if
there had been a leader they might have
held the dark passages until the tatars were
sickened by the slaughter of their men

  such was the doom of alamut torches
flaring through chambers hung with gold
cloth and uttered with jeweled statuary
from trebizond with silk rugs of ispahan
swords flashing in dark tunnels where
naught was heard but the gasping of men
bitten by steel and the sound of bodies
falling to the earth wailing and lamenta-
tion in the gardens under the date trees
which were the evil paradise of halen ibn
shaddah and the splash of stricken women
in the canals dark-faced squat men in
mail and fur cloaks trampling through
treasure-rooms where the riches of a thou-
sand caravans and a hundred cities stood

  never had the followers of kiragai khan
taken spoil so rich pearls from damascus
golden fish from che-ting emeralds and
sapphires from tabriz urns of gold shekels
from the merchants of samarkand and
ornaments from the califate of bagdad that
would grace the court of a mongol emperor
slant eyes of the kallmark horsemen
widened and they urged their dogs into
the rivers of wine in the gardens ripping
into shreds rugs and hangings splintering
porcelain kiosks with rocks and trampling
on the bodies of the dead few lived

  and still the master of alamut was not
found once iba kabash who had at-
tached himself to the winning side and was
spared because he brought berea safe to
kiragai khan paused beside the body of a
very large man cloaked and jeweled but

he spumed it with his foot when he turned
it over for the giant face was that of a black
eunuch

  yet there was one who said he had found
halen ibn shaddah iba kabash who was
eager to find favor with his new lord
offered trembling to take him to the
circular chamber of rashideddin berea
came with them for she was not one to
leave the side of kiragai khan in battle
being the daughter of a hill sheik and not a
tatar woman

  they climbed the winding stairs escorted
by the renegade with torch-bearers and
armed kallmarks in the circular chamber
of the astrologer they saw a strange sight
the room had been dark by the flare
of their torches they made out three men
two dead and the third sitting on the floor
kiragai khan paused for a moment by the
body of toctamish burned and bloody
for the man had been one of his lieutenants
and very brave

  he died under torture lord and celestial
master gibbered iba kabash pointing
for he would not tell of the queenly berea
or the coming of the noble tatars

  kiragai khan said nothing passing to
the next body and pressing the hand of
berea when the girl cried out this one
was rashideddin his gray robe stained with
red and his lean face convulsed his arms
flung wide and sightless leering eyes
staring upward through the opening to the
stars the astrologer had died in the grip of
anger berea leaning over him watched
vainly for a breath to stir the gray cloak
seated beside rashideddin she saw khlit
wiping his sword calmly with a corner of
the dead mans cloak

  have you seen halen ibn shaddah
demanded iba kabash officiously the
noble kiragai khan has missed you since
he came into the entrance of alamut was
it you that killed rashideddin

  aye answered khlit looking up indif-
ferently have the kallmarks or the
refik the upper hand i have seen halen
ibn shaddah

  the battle is over klilit exclaimed
berea pressing forward but keeping the
hand of the tatar leader her eyes were
shining and she held her head proudly
the doom of alamut has come as i swore
it would it was my will that it should
mine and my lords for i came to him
without a gift and was ashamed yet did


adventure

he marry me in spite of that and i swore
to him that if he would avenge my father
such a gift should be his as no other bride
could bring alamut would be his with
the treasure of the refik and now he has
seen that the gift is rich all that halen
ibn shaddah had

  khlits glance sought that of the tatar
leader and they measured each other
silently

  the way is long from tatary went
on berea tossing her head but i am very
beautiful in the sight of my lord and he
consented to my plan-to come to open the
gate to him-saying only that toctamish
should come i picked you cossack as
my father of battles yet i am grieved
you swore that you would slay for me halen

ibn shaddah-

  have you seen broke in kiragai khan
gruffly the one who is called master of
alamut

  aye he was here

  which way did he go speak

  he did not go

  the khan looked around the chamber
it was empty except for the two bodies a
sudden blast of air from the opening over-
head made the flame of the torches whirl
and cast a gleam on the face of rashideddin
as if the dead man had moved berea drew
back with a smothered cry

 the man who was called halen ibn
shaddah said khlit was a eunuch of
great size the real master of alamut was
another he concealed his identity to avoid
the daggers of those who would slay him
yet is he slain and i have kept my oath
berea princess

  the eyes of the others strayed to the body
of rashideddin and rested on the red stains
that garnished the gray cloak with the red
ribbons of death the blind eyes of halen
ibn shaddah were fixed on the stars visible
through the opening in the ceiling and
khlit seeing this knew that he would be
very glad to turn his horse again toward the
steppe and away from alamut

to a soldier

grit is one of the few remaining
towns on the mojave desert
that represents a survival of
much that has passed away in
other portions of the west

  adobe houses warped and crumbling
from a half-century of sun and rain a
main street double-flanked by saloons and
an array of horse-troughs mongrel dogs
and nondescript mexicans are still its chief
characteristics many of the old-time tra-
ditions and habits still linger about the
place recalling the period when gold-dust
was the chief currency at roaring jack bar
and sourdoughs went bravely out to loot
the hills of their hidden wealth

  among the things that still survived
when the events of this story occurred was
the official range pay-day when sun-
browned lithe-flanked cowboys came riot-
ously in from the south and east to waste
the earnings of months over the green felt
tables the faro parties that lasted the night
out leaving the players heavy-eyed and
spent with empty pockets and the eternal
hope of ultimate bonanzas burning in their
brains the perpetual arguments between
cowmen and sheep-herders over the rights
of the range and then-not least among
the institutions of grit there was sheriff
bill doble in his grimy-windowed office
adjoining the general store with his rows
of dust-hung law books and his picture gal-
lery of reward placards

  bill had been sheriff in grit so long he
had earned the repute of an institution
like the alkali dust that filtered in with the
autumn sandstorms and the night wind

that bit down on the flatlands from the san
bernardino mountains old bill tilted back
in his swivel-chair rowelling the antique
desk with his spurs had become an integral
part of local scenery in los angeles bill
would have been classified as a tourist
attraction and the world taught to make
a pathway to his door but in grit the
world passed him by when it passed at all
with a friendly salute content that he stood
sponsor for the law and order for which the
town was famed afar

  personally bill was just the kind of a
sheriff one would expect to find in a desert
town he was solid and substantial from
his spurs to his snake-belted sombrero
what he had to say was short and pithy
and his convictions left no room for misun-
derstanding in fact bill never had but
one argument and that it had been but
five times disputed was plainly on record
the heavy colt six-gun that dangled from
his belt bore carefully carved notches on
the butt the further reputation of always
giving a square deal and of standing for
unvarying honesty had brought the respect
of the entire range country

  such was the status of affairs when into
the even tenor of grits daily program on a
hot july night came buck saunders
bucks advent was a bomb hurled into the
tranquility of the towns regular routine
which left a changed order of tilings that
is still discussed in reminiscence around
camp-fires in the cow-country when the
chuck ceremonies are over and the brand-
ing crews rest from their strenuous labors

  as a foreword to the arrival of buck




adventure

saunders mention of the transfer of
rusty mcgee roper and buckaroo to-
gether with his caballo and his personal
effects from the hashknife rancho to the
double-o headquarters is of more than
passing importance for rusty had con-
siderable to do with buck saunders in the
eventful days that ensued albeit their
arrival in the same territory was purely
coincidental rusty came with a good
recommendation a mat of fiery red hair
and a cheerful smile-a bond on the
range where men are appraised and ac-
cepted or rejected frankly on their face
value

  rusty mcgee was irish which explains
at once his hair his grin and his eternal
brag of himself his family and all that
pertained thereto rusty had a brother
jim who was a ranger with the canadian
northwest mounted police to rusty the
sun rose and set in jim he spent hours
telling the double- boys about the won-
derful things jim had done up in the coun-
try where the lakes are fastened together
and the bull caribou thunder down with the
flare of the northern lights at their heels
at first it all made little impression but
water dropping upon a rock will eventually
wear a dent and after a time the punchers
began subconsciously to absorb a little of
rustys creed

   they were still in the preliminary stages
of appreciation when buck saunders left his
haunts on the mesa perdita where he had
been rustling cattle for a pastime and set
out for new worlds to conquer he chose
for want of something better the gambling-
house of money meek which occupied a
leading position among similar institutions
in the town of grit as johnnie murray
foreman of the hashknife rancho who wit-
nessed the whole episode afterward de-
scribed him buck was an ornery varmint
with a mean eye who wore his sombrero
on the hump of his nose and packed a gun
on each leg with the toe of the holsters tied
down for a greased lightnin draw

  buck picked a sweltering night when the
place was full he kicked open the swing-
ing doors and walked in with a colt in each
hand while two-score cowboys and sheep-
men stood with upraised hands he made his
wants known in succinct language the
situation was plain to even the stupidest
mexican among them

  git a move on buck adjured i got

other business besides waitin on you horn-
bres

  under the outlaws direction die bar-
tender emptied the contents of the till and
the faro-dealers drawer into a bandanna
handkerchief then he went through the
pockets of those present and added what
he found to the collection the whole he
handed to buck who tucked it in his shirt
backed from the place with a wary eye for
possible gun-play and disappeared from
sight into the shadows of the night on a
mean-faced pinto

  and there we stood said johnnie mur-
ray like five minutes to one not a gun
in the crowd nobody havin figgered on the
genuine article payin us a visit like that

jpsai as might be surmised the liold-
pvyj up formed the main topic for dis-
cussion at breakfast the next mor-
ning when the double- outfit stamped
into the ranch-house with the tingle of
pump water still on their faces sheriff
bill doble had come out of his lethargy
organized a posse and long before midnight
had set out across the mesa on the trail of
the bandit some of the punchers were
optimistic about the result others were
noticeably silent but rusty mcgee was
openly scornful

  up in canada he said there wouldnt
be no such tom-foolery as sendin an army
out to get a four-flusher like buck saun-
ders hes a one-man job whats the
matter is your sheriff gettin old

  the boys tried to explain that age cut
no figure in the matter that it was cus-
tom dating back to time immemorial and
based upon the exigencies of the occasion
and plain lioss sense but rusty mcgee
refused to see it that way he argued that
the thing was being overdone and that a
fugitive had his chances of escape increased
by being able to both see and hear a posse
while a single officer well armed and coura-
geous could run him down with greater
surety

  thats what jim says he added as a
clinching argument and he aint never
lost a man yet

  rustys position was considerably
strengthened when along toward nightfall
the posse returned empty-handed and worn
out with eighteen hours -fruidess beating of
cottonwoods and mesquite johnnie mur-
ray saw them first and he noted the general
hip shootin



attitude of the riders he nudged clothes-
pin mills with his elbow and pointed toward
the cloud of dust kicked up by the lagging
hoofs of the animals

  they done lost him he commented
that red-headed rusty mcgee aint such

a-fool as he looks

  the which i was thinkin when i heard
him palaver agreed clothespin sapiently

  the posse turned its horses into the
double- corral for the night they had
few comments to make being too tired and
hungry for conversation sheriff bill al-
ways reticent bordered on taciturnity he
ate his dinner in silence and vouchsafed
only monosyllabic grunts to the questions
plied by the curious punchers

  rodeo sam one of the posse and a
wrangler from the triangle-z outfit ex-
pressed the general sentiment in an under-
tone to johnnie murray as they were turn-
ing into the bunks for the night

  bills takin these things to heart moren
he used to he said i remember when
he used to liquor up and call it a night
he would say there is always a manana
mebbe hes wore out suggested john-
nie murray

  shouldnt wonder bill aint so young
as he used to be

  johnnie murray recalled rusty mcgees
remark and he found himself speculating

  the posse spent the rest of the week
searching the foothill region without un-
covering a trace of the outlaw the hunt
finally dwindled away to sporadic excur-
sions into the cottonwood and yucca dis-
trict in the hope that something might
show which would approximate a clew
a score of inquiries spread broadcast
through the medium of cattlemen failed
to bring even a hint of the where-
abouts of buck saunders save that once a
glimpse of a crouching figure on a pinto
pony had been had by a passing sheepman
at the lower end of the county

  while this was taking place rusty mc-
gee was making the most of his opportunity
for impressing the double- boys with his
theory of the duty and obligations of a
sheriff rusty had nothing against old
bill doble down in his heart he held a
secret admiration for him but he could
not help making comparisons between old
bill and his brother jim he meant to be
fair he tried to be just but rusty was
a product of his race and always it was

the sheriff who suffered by comparison

  from an outspoken question regarding
bills age and incident lack of capacity as
he saw it he one day broke into open criti-
cism but there he fell afoul of one of the
strongest traditions of the cow-country
for no matter what other faults the aver-
age range-rider may have he is loyal to his
sheriff he will crawl out of a warm bunk
on the coldest nights and ride through slush
and mud and in pouring rain to go to his
assistance he is always ready with horse
and weapon to support the man who wears
the star to the limit of his ability

  rusty embarking upon his reckless cen-
sure of sheriff bill dobles attainments
found himself suddenly jerked to earth and
called upon for proof whereupon he swore
by all the sacred standards of the carrot-
haired mcgees that he would one day ad-
duce this evidence

  i aint sayin that old bill wasnt a
regular hellion in his day he would say
in the lulls between sad-eyed petes
baritone solo on the deep blue sea and
the harmonica obbligato of latigo jones
but that was a long time ago some one
of these here days bills goin to come in
all draped nice and neat over his saddle-
horn the same bein proof plenty sufficient
he had got too old for fast work you
hombres  be feelin some regretful about
then im thinkin

  the boys of the double-o would listen
to his words and spit in the fire thought-
fully

  rusty had his golden opportunity about
a month later when buck saunders tiring
of inaction dropped into san luis a sister
city to grit and farther north on the mo-
jave one of the first places he visited was
that of sandy mcpherson a scotchman
who ran the principal general merchandise
store in the place the streets were de-
serted it being early in the day and most
of the inhabitants save for the hangers-on
attending to such indoor duties as would
keep them out of the morning heat

  the outlaw walked in and called for a
tarpaulin mcpherson threw a stack on
the counter and named the price

  too much snapped buck

  take it or leave it rapped back mc-
pherson turning on his heel

  the outlaw stared at him with an ex-
pressionless face then he whipped his
revolver from its laced scabbard without


adventure

a trace of visible feeling he shot the scotch-
man twice in the back as he bent over
a bin with a sugar scoop in his hand mc-
pherson fell to the bin and died there
citizens of grit attracted by the sound of
the shots rushed to the spot to find him
with his feet sticking out of the bin gro-
tesquely-his wife pulling helplessly at
him buck she said had ridden away with
the tarpaulin

pph rusty mcgee and some of the
i double-o boys were in town at
the time and came up with the rest
they got sheriff bill on the long distance
and received his loud assurance that he
would be right over while they waited
the boys questioned the storekeepers wife
who had been a witness of the shooting as
to what had taken place from her they
gleaned as a striking fact that buck saun-
ders had shot from the hip-line without
raising his weapon

  cant you see bleated rusty mcgee
hes a hip-shooter theyre the worst in
the world its suicide to put old bill up
against a hombre like him now jim
says-

  but latigo jones interrupted the solilo-
quy

  oh shut up cant you you bandy-
legged maverick he growled jerking his
head toward the terrified woman aint
you got no sense at all

  rusty realizing that he had picked the
wrong time and place to stiffen his credit
relapsed into unwilling silence but he
was not to be suppressed

  when sheriff bill arrived he promptly
split the double-o in half taking men he
knew to be seasoned riders and best able to
stand the long gruelling test to which they
would be put to these he added a hand-
ful of local friends of the dead man out of
respect to the latters memory in a few
minutes cow-punchers were scurrying in all
directions gathering ammunition and pro-
visions blankets and winchesters within
half an hour after buck saunders had shot
down the peaceable scotchman fifty well-
armed determined men were hot on his
trail with sheriff bill doble riding well in
the lead on a big bay mare that was known
to be one of the hardest and longest trav-
elers on the range

  rusty mcgee was among the double-
boys that bill had selected to accompany

him he was a good rider an excellent
shot and with all his talk nerve and grit
to the backbone he had been picked with
the rest at the suggestion of sawbones
hawkins foreman of the double-o who
had been irritated at rustys criticism of
the sheriff and wanted him to get ac-
quainted with bill doble at close range
in this the code of the cow-country was
being followed to a nicety-the code which
never seeks to change a mans opinions by
argument but leaves it to the more em-
phatic school of experience

   straight out across the mesa perdita they
rode into the purple twilight haze where
turquoise and lavender met and mingled
with crimson and gold at their head rode
indian joe an indian trailer who was
invaluable to every posse when trails turned
to hard ground and aboriginal skill became
more valuable than white mens logic for
the most part the men were silent attend-
ing strictly to the business of conserving
their mounts across the uneven ground
the only sounds were the jingle of bridles
the steady drum of the horses hoofs and
the rattle of mile after mile of mesquite
against the stirrup leathers with now and
then some brief comment of the trail

  the sky which had been lowering all
day settled down at dusk into an ominous
blackness little gusts of wind puffed in
their faces bringing odd desert odors the
mesquite gave way to matted chaparral
and the jaws of dead mans canon closed
in upon them clothespin mills sniffed the
air like a hound and muttered to himself

  what say chirruped latigo jones
swinging in his saddle

   rain cornin

  its goin to be nice ridin tonight
  sure is where are we headin

  the johnson ranch i reckon

   i think old bills wrong on that

  same here that maverick buck saun-
ders never wasted no time cornin this way
he double-tracked back at morgans water-
hole and went south thats where he
hangs out bud stutz met him down
there last week

   did you tell bill that

  bill was with me when stutz told us
about it but bills got his own ideas you
cant argue with bill

  well id a heap sight rather bunk at
the johnson ranch than go stompin round
in the slush on a night like this
hip shootin



  he emphasized his remark with a glare
at the lowering sky latigo jones grunted
his agreement

  well you know the deal-fresh caballos
at the johnson ranch and keep on goin
i know bill he figgers on makin big
eye butte by mornin you can see a heap
of country from there you know get
me

  yeah i get you but i aint savin
nothin me-im doin a heap o thinkin

 rusty mcgee had been an interested
listener to the conversation he swung
his horse in closer and lowered his voice

  what do you say we drop out and trail
down by the water-hole way he asked

 not me declared clothespin with
finality this here is bills own private
funeral besides theres hot grub ahead
and im strong for it

  the posse was in the canon now the
way was narrow and the little band strung
out in single file picking its way among the
boulders with difficulty the work de-
manded their full attention and conversa-
tion lapsed an hours laborious riding
and they came out of the upper end the
lights of the johnson ranch were just visible
through the sudden night when the rain
overtook them by the time they reached
the friendly shelter of the ranch build-
ings the water was pouring down in
torrents

  the severity of the shower changed the
aspect of things the boys turned their
tired animals into the corral and clattered
into the ranch-house where johnson the
owner of the place gave them a cordial
welcome

  fan up old betsy he said jerking his
thumb toward a cast-iron stove in the mid-
dle of the living-room ill tell the chink
to hunt out some chuck steak and a pan
of soda biscuits some rain aint it

  the posse needed no second invitation
they stoked the fire spread out their wet
clothing and thawed themselves into some
semblance of comfort by the time the
feed was ready everybody was in better
spirits buck saunders became a remote
wraith of rain and storm to be forgotten
until tomorrow

  you aint calculatin on goin on to-
night are you asked the ranch-owner as
they pushed back their plates and felt for
pipes and cigaret papers the sheriff shook
his head morosely

  no use he replied trails plumb
washed out well hit it up at dawn

  the boys gave a sigh of relief they
wanted to round up the outlaw but trail-
ing through wet adobe in a pelting rain was
mighty disagreeable there was little
chance they would overtake him with the
dark in his favor there would be better
opportunity with the daylight he would
take a chance then of being seen by a pass-
ing herder or cowman that would start
a fresh trail there was plenty of time
they do not ride to a kill in one day on the
range it is persistence and not the time
element that counts in a desert man-hunt
so they settled down to the intricacies of
stud poker in the bunk-house with the
ropers from the ranch

at dawn the following morning
with freshened mounts under saddle
the posse swung upward into the
foothills the sky had cleared and every-
thing was new-washed and fresh a lilac
haze hung along the upper levels and in the
distance the rugged outlines of big eye
butte stood out in relief like a sharp-cut
cameo the little cavalcade wound its
way across the steaming earth discarding
known trails for less frequented roads most
likely to show a sign of the man they
sought

  ill bet a squaw-hitch he turned off at
that water-hole snapped rusty mcgee in
growing irritation

  listens reasonable opined clothesipn
mills reckon we might take a look
round on the way back

  accordingly when late in the day
sheriff doble finally backtracked toward
home after hours of fruitless search through
the bad lands of the mesa the two cow-
boys dropped behind the rest when they
reached the water-hole they turned into an
arroyo past a salt-lick to where green stuff
sprouting from the earth gave indication
of hidden water a brief space and they
came to the hole itself its edge stippled with
innumerable cattle tracks running in all
directions

  rusty jumped from his horse and studied
the ground closely clothespin hooked one
knee over his saddle-horn and rolled a cig-
aret as he licked his wheat-straw into
position a sudden exclamation from rusty
brought him to the red-headed ropers side

  look said rusty


adventure

  he indicated the mark of a shod horse
in the sand beside it was the print of a
mans boot-a high-heeled mexican boot
of the type ropers wear to give a firm an-
chorage in the ground clothespin followed
mcgees outstretched finger

  its buck sure as shootin said rusty
his hand shaking

  humph ejaculated clothespin bend-
ing down for a closer inspection

  rusty continued

  he got off here for somethin gave his
animile just time to water and then kept
on a-goin

  head down he began to circle like a
hound suddenly he swung off abruptly
along the bed of the arroyo to a clump of
underbrush gun in hand he stepped
through the bushes clothespin mills at his
elbow directly under a cottonwood tree
a horse was tethered by a slim correa with
a single knot the animal whinnied as the
two men came into view

  bucks hoss exclaimed clothespin his
mouth close to rusty mcgees ear

  they stood silent and tense-listening
there was only the faint rustle of small
ground-animals scurrying through the dry
branches underfoot rusty waved the nose
of his weapon at the animal

  he changed animiles here he com-
mented this here is the one he was
ridin when he plugged mac

  the two cowboys crept out into the open
alert for possible ambush but they were
unmolested earth trampled down by
restless hoofs and tracks running east and
west told the story to their trained eyes
it was as rusty had said the outlaw had
tied an extra animal at the water-hole for
emergencies riding to the utmost limit
of his horses speed he had gained sufficient
headway to give the beast a drink and
change saddles this done he had ridden
away again on a fresh mount more than a
match for the jaded posse behind him

  rusty glanced along the bed of the arroyo
where an ordinarily dry bed had become
a creek from the downpour of the night
before

  aint no use in tryin to foller him
now he said if wed come in here last
night wed a had him where he belonged
just like i thought

  clothespin mills scratched his head re-
flectively

  we might get the boys and lay round

in the bushes for awhile he suggested
he might come back after the caballo

  rusty mcgee shook his head

  not buck there was conviction in
his tone hes too foxy to walk into any-
thing like that nope-we just nachully
lost him this time thats all there is to
it the next time im gonna use my
own judgment-and not some other hom-
bres he flung the last with sudden
venom jim told me a long time ago
when i was man-huntin to play a lone
hand you cant never bet on any other
fellow he says

  clothespin mills dropped his weapon
back into its holster and nodded his head
thoughtfully

  thats no lie he said with conviction

  the finding of buck saunders rendez-
vous and the manner in which rusty
mcgees judgment had been sustained in
the matter of outlaw-hunting as related by
clothespin mills next morning to the
double- contingent raised the red-headed
cow-puncher several notches in the esti-
mation of his fellow ropers his standing
was still further enhanced when the out-
law emboldened by his first success held
up two more saloons within the course of
the next fortnight one was in pacheco
thirty miles from grit the other at du-
barte just across the mesa perdita in
each case sheriff bill doble had gone out
across the sands at the head of a posse in
pursuit in each case he had returned
empty-handed and disgusted conscious of
a growing unrest among his men

  it was not that the posse blamed sheriff
bill entirely buck was a genius for
swooping down on an unprotected or unpre-
pared community in addition he had a
secret hiding-place somewhere in the bad
lands to which he always returned when
the hunt grew close and which had not
yet been discovered bucks habit was to
lay low in the daytime and ride only at
night it was a combination hard to over-
come in a desert country mostly wide un-
guarded stretches of canon and valley a
posse might ride all day and be no nearer
the outlaw at sun-down than when it
started

  it was after buck held up and robbed
the bank at malona in the middle of the
day shot the cashier blind and escaped
with his booty and the posse saddle-weary
and dusty had returned without their man
hip shootin



and carrying the realization that the out-
law had changed his night-riding tactics
to open defiance that matters came to a
head

  from the minute sheriff bill gave the
order to return home after following an
aimless trail into the mohave sand he was
aware that there was a change in his men
conversation dropped out entirely here
and there he caught a furtive glance from
beneath a hat-brim supplemented by sul-
len mutterings and monosyllabic grunts
he was not surprised when they followed
him into his office in grit and hung over
his furniture in uncomfortable attitudes

  johnnie murray foreman of the hash-
knife rancho cleared his throat and stepped
forward aided by the urgings of several
elbows and covert glances of encourage-
ment

  bill he said twisting his sombrero
between nervous fingers the boys-
that is-we-

  he glanced around the room and re-
ceiving several nods of approval gathered
courage

  you see bill its like this youve
been sheriff a long time now and youve
done your share and a lot more we aint
sayin you ever fell down on the job as
far as that goes id be the first to knock
the block offn any hombre that said dif-
ferent he glared belligerently around
the room but times has changed and
old ideas kinda bogs down like a chuck
wagon in wet dobe huntin a bad-man
is-well bill its a young mans job get
me we been kinda talkin it over and
while we aint aimin to discount nothin
youve done bill we-that is-the boys
is hankerin for a change of administration
sort of

he waited and a dense silence
fell on the room old bill glanced
around the circle there was no
eye to meet his own the members of the
posse sat or stood in uncomfortable pos-
tures their eyes on their feet the ceiling
out of the window-everywhere except in
his direction johnnie murray was star-
ing at a band of sunlight that came through
the open window and made a pencil of yel-
low on the floor instinctively bill followed
the shaft of light until the distant hills
tinted with mellow autumn colors crossed
his vision

  yonder beyond those hills lay the great
mohave desert it was the one place in
all the world he knew and loved best the
rolling dunes with their undulating out-
lines the rugged sandstone outcrops that
shoved through from beneath like a giant
fist thrust upward the flaming grandeur of
the evening skies more beautiful than a
preachers heaven the fresh fragrant mor-
nings with the shifting colors of the dawn-
it was all his world his country his life

  his best years had been spent there
posse after posse he had led across the trails
he knew like the lines in the palm of his
hand man after man he had brought back
to pay the price according to range-lands
idea of justice until the coming of buck
saunders no outlaw in his territory had
escaped the reckoning the idea of quit-
ting had never entered his head he had
expected of course to die in his spurs-
most likely in the saddle now-they were
making it plain to him that he had failed
-a young mans job-bill glanced once
more at the circle that ringed him in

  there was a cold glint in his eyes now
so he was growing old was he suppose
his eye did hit fifty yards or so shy of his
record and his leg latches were getting a
might tight couldnt he pick a running
jack from the saddle five times out of six
with his old colt yet and do a days riding
with the best of them abruptly he
straightened his shoulders and cleared his
throat

  you want me to quit-is that the idea

  johnnie murray nodded his eyes still on
the shaft of light on the floor his voice
seemed to have left him

  without a word sheriff bill unfastened
his rusty star and dropped it on the desk
his handcuffs followed-and a bunch of
heavy keys from a drawer he took some
private papers which he tucked in his
pocket then he walked to the door

  the blank warrants is in the top drawer
and the code books over yonder on the
window-sill he said the big key fits
the jail door the rest of em unlocks the
desk for the barest second he hesitated
slong boys he said and banged the
door behind him

  there was a dead silence for a full mita-
ute after bill doble left red-eye weeks
broke it derisively

  well he ejaculated with elaborate sar-
casm i hope you mavericks is satisfied


adventure

me-im goin out and apologize to some
low-down coyote for herdin with a bunch
of hombres like you pore op bill

  he kicked a chair across the room by
way of emphasis and went out cursihg tor-
ridly

  that afternoon representatives of the
ranches along the deserts rim met in the
back room at black la farges gambling-
hall to select sheriff bills successor the
double-o hashknife stutz lazy-fish and
circle- ranches sent delegates the stutz
crowd suggested johnnie murray owing to
his reputation for daring and handiness
with a gun but the foreman of the hash-
knife rancho declined the honor in a charac-
teristic speech

  nix he said and his tone was em-
phatic i let myself be drawed into this
mess agin my will but im blamed if im
goin to wear any grave clothes to please
a bunch of merry widows if you-alls
chuckle-headed enough to think you got a
sheriff among you why go right to it
ive done all the dirty work im going to
me knowin the whole bunch of you i
opines youre a fine bunch of sucklin doves
-the same bein all strut and no eggs
huh

  the speakers remarks nettled rusty mc-
gee whose tinder was always laid to flare

  oh i dont know theres some of us
round here could make pretty blamed-good
sheriffs im thinkin he declared

  johnnie murray whirled and looked the
red-headed roper in the eye

  rusty he said his tone was omi-
nously quiet i call you youre for-
ever shoo tin off your face now its about
time to make good come to think about
it it was considerable your kickin that
rowelled us into askin old bill to take a
pasear from your conversation i now
takes it you are makin a bid for the job
of bein sheriff in his place they not
bein any rush of candates to the fore i
moves the nomnations be closed

  somebody tittered and a laugh ran around
the circle then the puchers saw that the
hashknife foreman was in earnest and the
idea caught like wildfire to the men from
most of the ranches rusty mcgee was as
good a chance as any other to the boys
of- the double- outfit the suggestion repre-
sented a chance to end rustys perpetual
stream of conversation about brother
jim with all that talk on the left side

of the ledger they had a right to look for
something to strike a balance and with
buck saunders loose on the range they
knew rusty would be too busy to spend
much time in reminiscence clothespin
mills was open in his admiration

  well you little ol son-of-a-gun he
said grinning widely at the foreman that
shorely was a right smart little mouthful
rusty started to protest but a roper
clapped him between the shoulders and
before he could get his breath back they
were rushing him down the street to the
office of grits only justice of the peace
where the necessary legal formalities were
complied with this done johnnie mur-
ray swung on the new sheriff of grit

  now you piebald son of cactus parents
he said you been tellin us for some
time what brother jim would a done
with this here buck saunders person well
-you got buck saunders all to your little
self now whats more you aint gonna
be interfered with not-at-all whenever
you feels called on to uphold your family
reputation while a few handsome cow-
punchers looks on and sees how its done
we aint goin to stop you speakin for
the community some general you neednt
be over-particular about bringin buck with
you the which we aint aimin to run no
hotel down at the jail likewise well be
some tickled to death to come and look
him over after youve done hip-shot him
into hell-fire

  rusty mcgee polished bill dobles rusty
old star on his sleeve and pinned it in posi-
tion he seemed oddly serious-for rusty
mcgee he walked to his horse with-
out making reply only when he had his
foot in the stirrup did he throw back a
response over his shoulder

  gents he said im askin you-all to
remember one thing that what you done
for a joke im takin dead serious

  and leaving the thought to soak in he
jumped his animal and galloped off to the
double- bunk-house to get his personal
belongings

the grass was showing green on
the grazing-lands around vaca a
town four miles to the north of
grit and the general headquarters for the
sheepmen of the community before things
began to grow interesting for rusty mcgee
in his new capacity as sheriff of grit the
hip shootin



herders were happy for an unusual fall
rain meant good prices for mutton in the
early spring with plenty of winter feed
as a result the ranch-owners were paying
good money to their men and the gambling-
halls and saloons were running to a more
than lucrative season

  lonesome jack miller was one of the
wealthiest of the upper foothill sheepmen
he was the owner of the paseo grande
ranch at the upper end of smoots pass
and during the late months of each year
would occasionally drop down to some of
the desert towns for a three days spree
and spend-fest vaca whose reputation
must have made nero revolve in his grave
for envy was his favorite stamping-ground
especially if he had more than his usual belt
of money to fling away

  it was his custom to pick out some par-
ticularly rabid dance-hall where greasers
half-breeds and railroad wops were wont
to congregate and sit in on a poker game
until the last of his ample bank-roll was
gone in this amusement he was generally
aided by most of the population of vaca
whose personnel would have made an honest
penitentiary blush for shame

  lonesome jack and rusty mcgee were
bosom friends and pals they had for-
merly worked in arizona together where
miller had saved mcgees life from a mad-
dened steer during a late-year rodeo out
of the episode had grown a friendship that
had led rusty more than once to cross the
strip of sand to the pestilent little town to
help his former chum liven things up among
the hated sheepmen by tying a can on
life whenever miller had spent all that
he brought down from the hills barring
enough for a supply of sow-belly and
aigs it was always rusty who put him
on a horse and started him homeward
bound

  on the night that buck saunders the
outlaw made his famous display of hip-
shooting de luxe rusty had left lonesome
jack peaceably playing stud poker in the
hell-abendin bar and had crossed to an-
other equally disreputable place across the
street with a couple of double- boys and
a crowd from the hashknife outfit who had
been on after rustlers

  they had just about reached the fourth
drink when the sound of gun-play across
the way brought them back on the run
they found lonesome jack miller lying on

the floor with two bullets in his stomach-
dead the others in the room were backed
up against the bar in a state of panic-a
band of wall-eyed blatties at a fox party
as a hashknife roper later described it

  rusty mcgee took three steps into the
room then he stopped and his colt six-
gun came out

  who done it he snapped

  his voice grated for lonesome jack was
his friend

  buck saunders a score of voices
answered him as they crowded around

  from the proprietor of the place jim
bledsoe rusty mcgee obtained the most
coherent account of what had happened
and it sustained all that the grit contingent
had heard about the outlaws capacity as
a killer

  lonesome jack was settin in on stud
said bledsoe when this here buck saun-
son blows in and buys a stack i dont
reckon a man in the place had any sort o
notion who he was for he sets in right cheer-
ful-him with his back against the wall
tilings was runnin smooth when i heard
some chairs scrape the which in this town
is fust cousin to gun-play thinks i theres
somethin wrong

  i takes a look here was this coyote
and lonesome jack facin each other over
the table jack had his hand on his wea-
pon like he was gosh-amighty ready to
pull it buck was standin up with his
gun-hand danglin loose with his fingers all
spraddled out like they had candy on em
and im tellin you gents i been passin
forty-rod over the boards for fifteen years
in some mighty tough places but i aint
never seen nothin like that hombres face
for double-barrelled crocodile meanness
right then i knowed without no further
introduction he was doin business with
buck saunders but says i to myself for
onct in his life he done picked the wrong
hombrel

  jack leans over the table sos buckll
get him good and he says yuh low-down
no-good squint-eyed coyote-just like that
kinda drawlin the words out

  i was lookin right at buck-me not
reachin for my old sawed-off seein as how
jack was plenty ahead on the deal-and so
help me god-the only thing that maver-
ick buck done was to hitch his shoulders a
couple of inches like a frenchie sayin i
dont know the next minnit his colt


adventure

was spoutin flame and destruction from
both hands like a human volcano he
plugs twice and then braced the crowd for
a comeback but there wasnt none jack
just kinda shuts his eyes like he was tired
and wilted down on the floor buck gives
the rest of the room the once-over and
seein none of us was hankerin to act hos-
tile after the gun-play wed seen he backs
out and fades we looks at jack but he
was deadern a flounder he never got
no chanct to pull his gun tall

  rusty mcgee stood silent at the conclu-
sion of the narrative wrapped in thought
then he turned abruptly and started for
the door the boys from the two ranches
made to follow him but he held up his
hand

  nothin doin hombres he said im
playin a lone hand in this game theres
been some palaver about me roundin up
this buck person the which aint altogether
appealed to my sense o humor under the
circumstances im not needin any help
if i aint back in a week you can ride out
and get us both

  rusty swung quickly into his saddle and
lashed his horse into top-speed swinging
toward the llano placido leaving the
punchers and sheepmen open-mouthed with
astonishment

  well the little red-headed runt ex-
ploded red-eye weeks aint he the
stuck-up kid though want any help
no kind sir says he im rollin this little
hill myself i aint no common cow-punch
no more me-im the sheriff 

  and johnnie murray shook his head

  no he said you got rusty dead
wrong red-eye hes hell-bent for action
this time we done kidded him too much
besides jack was his pal and hes double
sore with all the mean on top bein irish
he pulls a heady play and acts plumb fool-
ish he didnt want us to figger he was
afraid to go up agin buck single-handed
the which he aint but the blamed little
fire-and-tow fool will ride up on that killin
houn head down and buckll shoot the

tripe outen him for practise - why

was fools made anyhow

  the picture drawn by the big cattleman
struck the punchers as significant for their
knowledge of the outlaws tricks supplied
only too vividly the detailsthat johnnie
murray omitted but what to do there
was little or no use in going after him for

a posse would only increase his danger of
discovery now and double bucks guard

  hes shore goin up against the scur-
viest maverick on the range for fair de-
clared windy smith one of the hash-
knife ropers i plumb hate to see that
little show-barker called thataway

  yeah and theres a ring round the
moon too chimed in another and that
means more rain and a washed trail

  the boys stared at each other glumly
a man-hunt through the sagebrush flats
along the crumbling edge of buttes and over
slippery clay patches where a horse can get
no foothold with all its instinctive skill
was bad enough under the best conditions
but with all marks of previous travel
washed out with hands blue from the cold
of the soaking mountain mist saddle leather
creaking from the wet and a listening
human viper lying somewhere out in the
night with the nose of a rifle trained over a
sheltering rock-this was no sinecure the
boys missed none of it as they visualized
the situation to themselves

  lets trail the red-headed ijit snapped
johnnie murray suddenly wheeling on the
others its like this rusty aint no
child and he aint goin to walk into no
suicide club besides bein irish hell
get over his peeve meanin principally us
before hes pounded out ten miles of sand
and this here aggregation of gents bein
some loaded for cattle-rustlers might be
considered reasonable fine backin before
this things over what say

the idea was received with en-
thusiasm an hour later well armed
and with fresh mounts a grim band
of cow-punchers loped easily off across the
llano placido toward the foot of bone
mountain johnnie murray insisted on
taking injun joe the half-breed profes-
sional trailer along red-eye weeks had
been selected for the job of interpreter
being the only one in the party who could
understand the half-breeds gibberish with
hardly a word spoken between them the
self-constituted posse steadily loped along
covering many miles of ground before mid-
night

  the prophecy of the ring around the
moon was sustained when shortly after
that hour the mist that had settled around
them thickened into a drizzle for two
hours the horses their bodies steaming and
hip shootin



lathering splashed ahead through the
mud and rain finally red-eye weeks
who had been riding in front with the
trailer called a halt

  this here eddicated product in the flap-
jack pants he announced says hes lost
the trail

  johnnie murray exploded

  - he exclaimed i could a done

that good myself ask him what he thinks
we brought him along for

  red-eye exchanged several grunts with
the indian who was by this time off his
animal feeling around in the mud after
a few minutes the product waved his
arms above his head

  no use growled red-eye he says
big-water done washed everything out and
hes lost

  cant he sniff round or somethin de-
manded the hashknife foreman for the
love of pete whats the use of bein an
injun if youre goin to fall down like
this

  say shouted red-eye in exasperation
you talk to him will you you make
me sick

  well he makes me sick retorted john-
nie murray in deep disgust i got a blind
sheepdog that cant smell that would ve
done a blamed sight better

  red-eye tried a few more scraps of scram-
bled english and indian with the trailer
but all to no purpose so the posse finally
gave it up and took stock of their location
as best they could without a light after
some circling they finally located some
scrub cottonwood under which they hud-
dled with dripping ponchos until the first
breaking of the dawn disclosed their posi-
tion in a small arroyo which opened into
nuevo cut beyond lay perdito valley
objective of the ride

  as they swung their stiffened limbs to
saddle windy smith noticed the indian
sound asleep with his back against a tree
he stirred him up with his toe

  wake up ol blubberin choctaw he
said the trails done come home to roost
whilst you was sawin wood

  the indian jumped to his feet got his
bearings and shook his head then he un-
burdened himself of a few guttural remarks
to red-eye weeks hopped his bare-backed
cow-pony and clattered off down the arroyo
in the direction they had come

  whats happened to little weak-in-the-

head asked johnnie murray staring
after him

  he says chuckled red-eye as how
hes goin no further with a loquero because
cow-puncher always was plumb foolish
anyhow and besides hes wet and he wants
to go back to his squaw and get something
hot to drink

  the boys broke into a laugh that seemed
to wipe out the incipient grouch that every-
body wore johnnie murray cinched his
saddle-leather another hole and looked off
toward the end of the valley ahead
loomed big eye butte a huge granite jut
that stood out like a ruined pyramid
with a great top overlooking the flatlands
beneath somewhere at the base of that
great pile was the rendezvous of buck saun-
ders for whose capture dead or alive rusty
mcgee was taking his life in his hands the
thought acted as a stimulant

  reckon well be movin on he said
softly and flipped his horse into action with
the end of his riata

  single file the little cavalcade wound up
through the cut across the upper end of the
valley toward the base of the mountain
as they topped the rise that led down into
the floor of big butte valley murray sud-
denly threw up his arm every rider in the
party immediately sat his horse back on
its haunches following the foremans out-
stretched finger they made out a speck
crawling up the side of big eye butte just
across the canon from bone mountain so
near the ridge as to be outlined almost
in silhouette

  rusty mcgee cried one of the party

  the foreman shook his head

  take another look he said his head
was thrown back and his hat was pulled low
on his nose as he scrutinized the moving speck
through half-closed lids suddenly he slap-
ped his leg and gave a shout of excitement

  i knowed it i knowed it he exclaimed
i knowed there was something familiar
about that ridin there aint but one
man in this whole blamed county that can
ride a hoss up the side of big eye butte
thataway and not have to pick a trail

  the boys crowded closer

  by crickey its old bill doble they
shouted almost in unison with an exclama-
tion from red-eye weeks

  there could be no mistake once the like-
ness was placed for bill had his own way
of sitting a horse


adventure

  he sure aint headin for the top of big
eye is he queried windy smith leaning
forward

  not him replied johnnie murray
hes headin for bone mountain this
here is a short-cut along the side any-
body hidin on the top of bone couldnt
see him cornin thisaway while tother way
bill would be ridin in the open

  wise bill commented red-eye in ad-
miration he shore is one clever ol coot
presently as they watched the speck
crossed the skyline of the butte and van-
ished over the edge on to the plateau be-
yond thence to reappear again a moment
later on the slight depression that dipped to
the greater slant of bone mountain johnnie
murray galvanized into sudden action

  fellows he said bui aint ridin
like that for his health likewise bone
mountain aint such a bad place the which
to take a squint over the country for rusty

i reckon well just take a little pasear up
there and see whats goin on how

  the effect of his words was electrical a
pack of astonished horses were suddenly
roweled into life and the next instant the
cowboys were tearing across the open space
with the hashknife foreman in the lead
it took them just two hours to make the
top of the mountain-such was the condi-
tion of the country through which they rode
-taking the same trail followed by bill
doble on his big bay mare when they
finally swept out oh the level plateau as
flat as a table-top they gave one look across
the surface and fell to swearing with all the
fluency with which a puncher is gifted
from edge to edge of the mile-square rect-
angle there was not a sign of life

  the cowboys gave their horses a chance
to breathe and then impatiently they can-
tered across the level space toward the far
edge there on the very rim-weary
dusty their nerves and patience worn to a
raveling-they clustered in a compact knot
and peered over the edge to find with unex-
pected suddenness spread out nearly a thou-
sand feet below in the natural amphitheater
of the taza caliente a drama that would
have thrilled a movie producer to the soul

the taza caliente as the name
indicates is the hot bowl of an
b extinct volcano it is nothing more
than a huge pit resembling a natural
arena spooned out of the hills by some

igneous action of prehistoric days the
floor of the bowl is perhaps an eighth of a
mile in diameter stippled with huge gray
boulders and blocks of once molten rock
in the center a score of tiny geysers or
hot springs of sulfurous waters bubble out
draining through a narrow crack in the
bowl which extends off toward the south
the sides are pitted with caverns and grot-
tos until the ensemble looks as windy
smith expressed it like the entrance to
hell with the gate left open

  there lying on the floor on the taza
caliente comfortably braced against a
boulder which sheltered him from the heat
was buck saunders his rifle was resting
in his arm conveniently located for rapid
use his horse was nowhere to be seen
and the boys inferred rightly that it was
hobbled in one of the near-by caverns on
one side of the outlaw was a hot spring
bubbling and simmering in the heat on
the other was a hole of quicksand deadly
and treacherous the only path by which
he could be reached was over the huge
boulder toward which his rifle was pointing

  some two hundred feet away from the
outlaw tucked behind another rock of
jagged formation was sheriff rusty mcgee
but what a rusty his hat was gone
his shirt was torn half-off so that the skin
showed through in patches of white from
head to foot he was plastered with dried
adobe his face was grimed and bloody
where he had fought his way through innu-
merable acres of matted underbrush all
these details the boys got later for stand-
ing on the edge of the overhanging butte
all they saw at that height was the figure
of the red-headed sheriff worming along the
limestone bottom on his stomach toward
the unsuspicious buck saunders

  gosh amighty ejaculated windy
smith the little red-head is goin to get
his man sure

   he slapped his leg in excitement

  less buck hears him cornin com-
mented red-eye weeks skeptically

  johnnie murray gave the speaker a ma-
lignant glance then he whipped his rifle
from its saddle scabbard and slid to the
ground there came the sound of a shell
sliding into the discharge chamber-and
then johnnie murray cursing softly

  damnation he muttered squinting
along the sights i cant make him

  heat waves dancing up out of the bowl
hip shootin



disconcerted the aim and made a steady
bead impossible

  - you couldnt hit a fat man settin

still declared one of the hashknife outfit
in disgust

  lets go down the slant and get in on
the finish suggested another

  no use said the foreman itll be
all over before we get there

  buck was smoking a cigaret they could
see little puffs of smoke sail up into the air
and disappear rusty was crawling toward
him dragging his rifle in the warm mud
the boys packed together in a tense group
their eyes taking in every movement

  god exclaimed johnnie murray this
here is gettin on my nerves why dont
they start shootin

  rusty kept up his crawling until only the
rock separated him from the outlaw leav-
ing his rifle on the ground he drew his re-
volver a punchers invariable weapon for
close work and edged along on his elbows
it was apparent to the watchers on the rim
of the bowl above that he had an exact idea
of where buck saunders was located it
was also equally apparent that the outlaw
did not know that a soul was within miles
of him

  buck finished the cigaret he was smoking
and flipped the stub into the hot spring
then he stood up shook the sand from his
clothes and picked up his rifle it was at
that instant that sheriff rusty mcgee laid
one hand on a shelf of rock that projected
from the big boulder and in two lightning
bounds vaulted to the top buck whirled
at the sound and swung his rifle under his
armpit with one motion together the
two weapons shattered the silences of the
steaming caldron

  rusty mcgees hat sailed across the area
with a bullet-hole through the crown the
outlaws weapon described a parabolic
curve in mid-air and sank in the quick-
sand pit

  the exchange left rusty in command of
the situation he slid down the face of the
rock until he fronted the outlaw on the
level bucks back was half-turned he
stood rubbing his left arm which had been
jarred numb by the impact of the heavy
revolver bullet on his rifle stock rusty
appeared to be talking his weapon at the
outlaws middle they could see him ges-
ticulate with ills free hand once he
pointed off toward vaca as though he was

referring to the murder of lonesome jack
miller of a sudden he reached for his
handcuffs

  as the steel bands glittered for an in-
stant in the sunlight there came a quick
spurt of flame from under the outlaws arm
instantly mcgees weapon coughed back-
a single flash the sounds came up to the
tense little group of watchers with a hollow
plop-plop that was taken up by the walls
of the bowl and echoed and reechoed in
diminuendo for the barest fraction of a
second the two men stood motionless as
though each was awaiting the next move of
the other then rusty mcgee curled for-
ward on his face his fingers plucking at the
warm sand beneath him

  oh my god hes got him moaned
johnnie murray

  his voice sounded high and cracked like
an old mans the rest caught the rasp of
his rifle hammer as he dropped on one knee
to steady his aim before he could fire the
drama that had become in the- twinkling of
an eye a grim tragedy was interrupted

  buck was in the act of dropping his still
smoking weapon back into its holster when
his attention was caught by a movement
high up on the side of the bowl the boys
of the posse clustered on the rim above
caught it at the same time there in
plain sight about three hundred feet from
where rusty mcgee lay a silent figure on
the ground stood the one man everybody
in that part of the country had forgotten-
old bill doble

  the former sheriff was mud from head
to foot his hat was pulled low over his
eyes to shut out the glare of the sun from
beneath the rim his white hair stuck out
in a matted fringe slung over his shoul-
der english fashion was a belt of car-
tridges that glistened in the sun in one
hand he balanced his old-fashioned colt
six-gun-the one with the notches on the
handle clearly exposed to the outlaws
fire and within easy range he made no pre-
tense of seeking cover as buck saunders
swung on him

  the outlaw had just time to register the
picture when he went into action with both
hands straight from the hip he fired
again and again the bullets tin-owing up
little flecks of dust around bill dobles feet
the shots rippled together like the ha-ha-ha
of a machine-gun as he sprayed a deadly
hail of lead up the hillside toward his enemy


adventure

four-six times he shot while the white-
haired figure before him stood motionless

  and then-with all the calm deliberation
of a man shooting down clay pipes in a
gallery bill doble raised his old-fashioned
six-gun with its wickedly long barrel in a
hand as steady as the rocks that surrounded
him and with perfect precision shot buck
saunders neatly between his eyes

  the group on the rim of the bowl above
watched the bad man flounder in the sand
and then lie still the wreath of smoke
from bill dobles weapon hung idly in the
air for a moment and dissipated after a
bit he threw out the empty shell and began
to feel in his pockets for a jack-knife the
action broke the tension the eyes of the
little group met

  reckon we might as well go down and
get rusty said johnnie murray

  his voice was unsteady and his hand
as he dropped his rifle back in the saddle
scabbard was shaking

grit was just shutting up for the
night when a cavalcade of horsemen
trotted down the main street with
old bill doble in the lead with the dead
body of buck saunders swung over the
pommel of his saddle and rusty mcgee
swaying dizzily in his stirrups the whole
town turned out to hear the details crowd-
ing into the sheriffs office while the dead
bandit was spread out on the floor and a
physician bandaged up a bullet crease in
rustys skull the story was told with
much embellishment and illustration while
everybody shook old bill by the hand and
whacked him on the back in bursts of jubi-
lation

  after a bit mcgee began to show signs
of speech he motioned to red-eye weeks

  wheres the judge he asked weakly

  reckon hes over at la farges said
the other

  get him here pronto ordered rusty

  he fumbled in his pocket and brought
out the handcuffs he had never had a chance
to use then he unfastened the star from
his shirt these and a bunch of keys he
shoved into bill dobles hands

  gents said rusty as the last offi-
cial act the which im goin to perform as
sheriff i want to pick my successor-the
same bein the former sheriff of this here
community bill doble and if theres any
hombre what wants the privilege of sleepin

  alongside of buck yonder let him say dif-
ferent

  me-im through i got enough
houndin after coyotes like this here ani-
mile trailin through the rain wallowin
in mud feelin round a hot spring and get-
tin all cooked up like an egg and then get-
tin plugged in the head aint my idea of a
good time howsomever it might tickle bill
doble most to death give me a leg-nippin
cayuse or a loco longhorn to wrastle any
day in the week and all the time im
goin back to punchin cattle theyre
human

  old bill doble looked at the handcuffs
and the keys and the star which rusty had
thrust into his hand then he laid them
down on the desk and started for the door
a dozen hands brought him back hands
used to flopping steers for a pastime it
was at this juncture that judge smalley
grits justice of the peace who had sworn
rusty mcgee into office appeared sud-
denly in the doorway propelled violently
from the rear by red-eye weeks the
judges hair was disheveled his eyes in-
flamed and his hands shaking from one of
his periodic encounters with black la
farges best snake whisky indignation
over his enforced method of travel showed
in his face but he was also distinctly
worried about something

  step up old fire-tongs greeted rusty
mcgee and view the ornariest carcass
that ever flopped to the glory of grit when
youve got an eye-full you-all untie that dis-
tinction you done hog-tied on me the same
bein too onhandy for my temprament
and belongin by rights to the killer of that
hip-shootin devil on the floor

  judge smalley peered at the recumbent
and late mr buck saunders bad man
then a flicker of comprehension showed in
his eyes

  thash a ri he said no shermony
neshary thash whash been worryin
me

  he nodded his head with an expression
of relief

  what do you mean no ceremony neces-
sary

   zactly what i shay said the judge
rushty couldnt reshign fm offish cause
he never wash sherff shnot legal make
sherffs th way i made em i got all mixed
up looked it up in book afterward
zhash wha i did bill sherff all lime
swordfishin



  you mean-all that sweatin in of rusty
you did werent no way leg johnnie
murrays tone was incredulous

  zhash ri chuckled judge smalley
tipsily i was all mixed up-terrble
mixed up  bill good ol bill always
was sherff

  the crowd broke into a storm of laugh-
ter and cheers old bill doble blew his
nose violently and spat on the stove
rusty mcgee took the star out of his hand
and pinned it on bills shirt-back in the
same old holes where he had worn it before
then he grinned under his bandage

  say bill he said tell me somethin
will you how came this maverick didnt
wing you when he was doin all that fancy
hip-shootin i got a mild curiosity for
information now its all over he was
hells lightnin on the trigger that buck
was and fastern scat on the draw and

yet by jinks-

  he left the sentence unfinished

  sheriff bill doble cleared his throat and
spat again on the stove

  son he said i done learned a lot of
things in my time but one thing i learned
powerful strong-that a hip-shooter and a
mule is considrable alike close up they is
hell but git off a ways and there aint

  neither of em can hit nothin consequent
when i does business with one or tother of
em i does it from a distance and takes my
time

  rusty mcgee glanced down at the out-
law once terror of the mojave spread-
eagled on the floor with a bullet-hole
through the center of his forehead

  i reckon yere right bill he said
facing the wide smiles around him i
shore reckon yere right and i guess i
done learned a few things myself only i
learned em some recent one of em is
that it aint any kind of shootin that makes
a sheriff its just plumb natural hoss
sense the which is powerful oncommon

  he reached up and caressed the bandage
on his head

  johnnie murray had his golden oppor-
tunity and he took it

  you aint goin back on yore brother
jim up in canada are you rusty he
asked maliciously

  the red-headed roper threw him a bale-
ful glance then he dropped into a near-by
chair and buried his aching head in his
hands

  - he said you never could be-
lieve a word jim said he always was a
-liar

author of the admiral of the line chaplain to the buccaneers etc

the anvil-chorus of the kling-kling
birds in the coconut palms over
sam chungs rum-shop awoke
warden the american visitor
what stirred the anglo-jamaican in his
cot on the other side of the room was
the whack of the americans shoe hitting
that spot on the wall where a huge spider
had been a second before

  through sleepy eyes hambridge the
sun-scorched man with the faded biue eyes
and fair hair amusedly observed his guests
apprehension over the fact that the spider
had mysteriously reappeared right above
the americans bed warden pajamaed
and slipperless shot from his cot and armed
himself with the tin wash-basin-loaded

  can the brute swim he asked per-
ceiving that hambridge was awake

  that spider said the anglo-jamaican
banana-man with a yawn and a drawl that
had creole languor in it that spider
buccra can do anything it can turn it-
self into a man or any other sort of beast
it can vanish and reappear somewhere
else at will its the brer fox of west
indian lore its name is nancy and its
harmless so far as its bite goes in darkest
africa it was the great god ananzi-god of
cunning-and its the most infernal bad
luck to kill one now how about caw-
fee

  mean to tell me that lump of hair and
legs isnt poisonous wow its as big
as my fist with the fingers spread

  hes also the god of beneficence said

hambridge solemnly if you believe in
him if you dont-ask any roadside
quashie how buzzards came by their bald

heads

  the overseer chuckled but suddenly
turned his head toward the jalousied door
leading to the native outhouses his voice
arose in the broad dialect

  a weh dat gyal habigail dis buccra
not gwine hab cawfee dis fine marnin
ah cornin ri dis minnit busha over-
seer sing-songed a voice from the out-
house kitchen

  mek it soon-soon den for dis banana
day-yah urged the busha

  warden still eyed the motionless spider
on the wall above his cot he would rather
have dispelled his doubts by slaughter for
he was not superstitious yet who was he
to cast doubt upon the mystic beliefs of
darkest africa especially when his anglo-
jamaican host shared them

  i suppose if i lammed the brute said
warden humorously and pereira got
ahead of you today by a single banana
bunch youd boot me out of rio hacha
n-no said hambridge rising lazily
but if my runners heard youd killed a
nancy before breakfast theyd chuck the
fight before it was started ho gyal
weh dat cawfee

  cornin busha

  the jalousied door swung open and a
beaming mulatto girl entered with a bent
tray bearing two tin cups of steaming blue
mountain flanked by a couple of star-apples

and some bread buttered with canned
bluenose

  mamin buslia said the girl with a
white-toothed grin

  to the visitor she accorded less genial
deference without the grin she bowed to
warden and said-

  marnin buccra

  that any fight was in the air nature at
least denied outside the rough shack
which was the ports headquarters of the
caribbean fruit company rio hacha lay
like a dead spanish ruin before being resur-
rected by the promise of new day

  it was a semi-circle of crumbling slave-
built houses on one side of a white sand road
that curved inward between two horns of
volcanic rock goring out to sea on the
eastern horn under the coconut palms
where the kling-kling birds clamored their
anvil-chorus sam chung the heathen let
down the bars of his saltfish quattie bread
and rum store in preparation for the great
business of the week-banana day on
the other horn pereira the portuguese
creole emerged from the shack which was
his abode and rio hacha headquarters of
the banana trust the amalgamated and
scanned the field of prospective battle with
his small soft eyes

  there was no promise of conflict either
in him or the scene the world was tinged
with rose the suns rim was not up over
the edge of the still oily caribbean the
sea-breeze was not due for an hour and the
noon roar of the surf on the reef was but
as yet a mere sigh

  between the horns on the inner side of
the incurving sand road rio hacha still
slept it would sleep late this morning
for the day would properly begin at noon
and last through the ensuing night about
midday the place would wake up when
pereira took his station at the buying wharf
of the amalgamated banana company
when his rival hambridge of the caribbean
occupied his overseers bench at the inde-
pendents pier and when the runners of
the two companies began to squabble over
the incoming drays carts donkeys and
black humanity laden with banana bunches
from the plantations and the native patches

  as the banana day progressed the fight
would grow more bitter as price and de-
mand soared or declined as the required
fruit fell short or otherwise the steamers
of the rival lines would appear racing neck

and neck perhaps for the mouth of the
bottle-shaped lagoon then would begin
the loading and when the last whaleboat
was emptied of its green-gold treasure the
race would be resumed for the market-
ports of baltimore philadelphia new york
and boston then rio hacha like many
another port would fall asleep again for
another week

but at that early hour there was
no hint of the banana war another
battle of which was presently to be
waged the war which had been growing in
heat for weeks between the banana trust
and the independents who sought a place
in the sun where the tiger defied all comers

  for a year the amalgamated banana
company had been making a point to put
the caribbean fruit company out of busi-
ness to defeat this-at rio hacha at
least-the independents had sent ham-
bridge to that fruitful port to match his
brains against a pastmaster of banana-
running-jose pereira of the trust forces
hambridge with a white mans mental
energy plus native birth and understand-
ing had made good in all branches of the
business from selecting and clearing ground
to reaping a crop of straights

  pereira wily behind his sleek sleepy
exterior looked as harmless a west indian
as ever lost energy by climate and slack
morals he was unhealthily fat his
smooth swarthy cheeks trickled humidity
on all occasions his silk shirt-he had
a weakness for unwashable silk-clung to
his perspiring girth like a clammy balloon

  he also wore sandals strained crash
pants and a broad felt hat which it was
said he bought by width-it looked like a
limp parasol and he had a fondness for a
sprinkling of dried lavender sprigs in his
tobacco when the breeze wafted a whiff
of lavender from the west hambridge was
wont to become profanely energetic

  pereira having smelled the air and
scanned the eastern horizon where the
steamers would appear on the race from
port to port retired to morning coffee and
buttered roast plantain

  hambridge and his guest warden having
disposed of blue mountain and bluenose
strolled in their pajamas to the rio hacha
for the morning swim usually they took
the guns along or mitch-chell the buskas
black henchman brought the rods and live


adventure

shrimps for tarpon but-this was banana
day

 some power in the north who had
thought not beyond his desk or possibly
was trying an experiment on public opin-
ion had proposed a tax on bananas that
the people howled mattered little to the
banana-men at banana sources it was all
right about the poor mans luxury so
long as the poor man bought

  at present the poor mans agents-the
middlemen up north-were buying on his
behalf the other half for themselves the
dealers were stocking their refrigerators
with green fruit to be ripened by raising
the temperature in sympathy with the ante

  already the price per bunch as yet the
same to the poor man who bought fingers
hands at most from the corner grocer
was soaring among the banana islands
future bunches fitting on the trees were
being snapped up by contract and for fancy
prices before the tax proposal the busi-
ness had been at unusually low ebb
straights down to thirty-five cents on
the tropic wharves seven-handed bunches
down to eighteen cents sixes rejected
altogether as not worth their stem weight
and returned with all smaller bunches for
quashies family pot and pig-feed

  but since the tax proposal prices had
moved steadily upward the first week
the rio hacha quotations of both the
amalgamated and the caribbean companies
fluctuated from fifty cents to fifty-five
with a tot of rum for the donkey-man who
brought in not less than four straight
bunches the second week while con-
stant reader and pro bono discussed
the tax up north the islands price went
up to sixty-five and seventy cents per
straight with frequent fist-fights between
the runners of pereira and hambridge

  in one such fight a scared jackass laden
with five eleven-handed bunches-extra
straights-fled with its coveted load and
committed inadvertent suicide in the rio
hacha and once hambridge irritated by
lavender floating down from westward
called pereira a soor kaboocha which pe-
reira ignorant of hindustani but sus-
picious resented

  the third week hambridges chief hench-
man mitch-chell smote the amalgama-
teds chief runner in the eye pereiras
man had called him a tiefin porpus
which is not hindustani but has to do with

the questionable honesty of a person who
has once been in a home for paupers both
were arrested but promptly released the
police force owed both hambridge and
pereira since the last poker game-a love-
feast which occurred on the evening fol-
lowing each banana day when the nights
again grew lonesome

  now it was the dawn of the fourth ba-
nana day since the tax proposal in his
hip pocket pereira had a written slip
brought in the night by a black boy on a
mule it was from the amalgamaleds
boss at port antonio it tersely stated his
instructions

  rio hacha fifteen thousand bunches-sixes up
average seventy-five cents-dollar limit steamer
haciendado arrive  pm to clear at midnight

  at the caribbeans shack hambridge
had a message from the independents
chief whose headquarters were at port
maria the chief happened to be war-
dens father his son fresh from an
american college was in jamaica to ob-
serve ananzi spiders the native and other
animals and to learn the difference between
para and guinea grass white yams and
afu and particularly the difference between
a banana and a plantain the bus ha was
expert in these matters

  warden srs message of instruction was
less formal

  buy all you can lay hands on and keep out of
jail go pereiras limit and then some tax on
bananas taxing demand if we dont get the trim-
mings the amalgamated will show the rah-rah
boy something

  this message hambridge studied again
after the swim when he and the rah-rah
boy had returned to the shack it was a
perfectly clear message there was nothing
about it that should have brought a moody
frown to the bushas sun-scorched brow
he studied it turned it over and even held
it up to the light once when the amal-
gamated had been waylaying the carib-
beans dispatch bearers the busha himself
had written an important message with
banana-juice which remained invisible un-
til it had been laundered with a hot flatiron

  but this message from warden sr was
all on the surface it was just as ham-
bridge had expected the wording would be
yet he was troubled he did not know
himself why or what about he had had
the same vague feeling that time he put
his money on a sure favorite in the overseers
the great god ananzi



sweepstakes and lost a months pay a
saddle and faith in his own perspicacity
his abstracted reverie was disturbed by
warden jr

  but how can you tell it isnt a taran-
tula he asked

  the ananzi was still on the wall

  you can tell shortly after it bites said
the banana-man irritably the banana
bunches are full of them and i never knew
one bite except in the new york papers

  he rose and went to the jalousied door

  mitch-chell he roared go bring
come a gallon a rum-yah

  eu-eu busha assented a guttural from
without

  an tell he no sen dis buccra parafeen
all color up wi annotta like las week
said hambridge jamaica man no fool
bout good rum

  as bad as all that said warden when
mitch-chell had departed chungward

  a nigger out of the bush will fall for a
three-farthings of rum where hell turn
down a threepence extra on the bunch
the busha growled

  he went into the cubbyhole which was
his office presently his runners ragged
bare-footed black and shiny as wet ebony
gathered around him for a war council over
a sheet of names

  with a pencil the busha checked off this
man of the hills and who were expected
to bring in fruit before nightfall this
man was no good-pereiras body and soul
-pereira had loaned him money this
fellow was doubtful but mitch-chell was
at his brothers wake wasnt he mitch-
chell must take care of him pereira had
been angling for this other fellow-a regu-
lar six-straight-bunch man give him a
drink first then talk him up

  and so on pereira on the western horn
was holding a similar war council with his
native runners the chiefest of whom had a
bruised eye

  warden had taken a gun after one more
respectful glance at the great god ananzi
on the wall and gone off to the hacha
swamp to pot baldpates on the rise to the
hog-plum feeding in the hills

when the american visitor re-
turned to rio hacha it was past
noon his steps had taken him
over into the bengal plantation where he
had become interested in the barracks of

the indentured coolie laborers and a beauti-
ful but brainless creature of no caste what-
ever who looked like oriental romance
under the sounding name of latchimi

  but he forgot about his hindi flower-
who had been married when she was nine
although he did not know it-when lie
tried to recognize rio hacha the settle-
ment which at morn had seemed as dead
as the spaniards who built it under don
sasi was now alive with jamaican clamor
and american hustle

  the wharves of the rival companies were
scenes of activity on the piers half-clad
negroes were piling bunches of green-gold
fruit at each pile a mulatto clerk in an
immense hat checking the bunches as they
were passed into a whaleboat by perspiring
handlers

  in the doorway of the caribbeans wharf-
building hambridge sat under a huge pith
helmet watching the battle which was going
on directly before him on the sand road
down at the amalgamateds wharf where
the portuguese sat complacently breath-
ing lavender there was on the other hand
comparative order

  the main road from the hills entered
rio hacha from the east and the incoming
fruit-carriers ran the rivals gantlet at the
caribbeans wharf once past that point
it was agreed that the spoils were to pe-
reira but that worthys runners were on
the job with hambridges at the danger
point both sides yelled cursed cajoled
threatened and tried to bribe the dazed
quashie from the interior who had ar-
rived with his humble donkey and his
banana patchs yield of fit bunches for
the week

  clashes between the rival runners be-
tween the banana-sellers and the over-
zealous banana-buyers were so frequent
that one continuous fight was in progress
the moment one was settled and peace
established generous libations at sam
chungs rum-counter led to renewed re-
criminations

  when warden arrived on the scene he
witnessed a typical collision a well-to-
do native planter had arrived with twenty
straight bunches in a small dray dragged
by an unhappy mule that was half-sus-
pended between the shafts the negro was
a newcomer to rio hacha drawn thereto
by the promise of high prices

  unused to rio hacha methods he flayed


adventure

the belligerent runners with his cowhide
whip failing to dislodge them from the
top of his dray he turned his lash upon the
mule urging it out of this pandemonium
knowing that if the dray once passed the
caribbeans wharf the fruit was lost to
pereira hambridges runners seized the
animals head pereiras runners tried to
dislodge them the proprietor raised his
arms to heaven and called upon his maker
to bear witness that he was a baptist in
good standing and had never backslid or
been in the poorhouse-whatever these
virtues had to do with the case

  then the mule took a part in the affaip-
resentfully it let loose with its hind legs
the traces broke a shaft cracked two
minutes later pereira got the mule and
sections of harness hambridges men bat-
tled in the dust with the rival runners for
possession of the fruit that which sur-
vived undamaged presumably found its
way to baltimore by the caribbeans
steamer

  the man from the hills went back to his
yam-patch and his dusky bride with a
smashed dray a penitent mule in mended
harness the price of nine good bunches
mostly in his head the rest being in sam
chungs till five rejects and the remains
of six mutilated banana stems but then
he had learned much

  hambridge observed all this without
once rising from his bench or removing the
pipe from his mouth occasionally he
wrote an order and had it passed to mitch-
chell it usually was a command to give
some prospective banana-seller a la-a-arge
drink of rum

  how goes the battle general asked
warden coming to the bushas side

  good enough said hambridge rather
gloomily we hold our own hes ahead
of us on his contracted fruit of course and
hes turned a lousy trick or two but the
days young

  he spoke with a kind of abstraction a
certain doubt warden thought the over-
seer did not look quite himself-a touch of
fever perhaps he advised a personal
application of the bribe-bottle as a stimu-
lant to zest

  i dont as a rule said the bus ha
thoughtfully but i may before im
through

  the afternoon lengthened and swift dusk
came into rio hacha trundled more

donkeys drays and natives burdened with
bananas many lights appeared on land
and sea and the tropic heavens lit their
million candles the fireflies danced among
the coconut palms and the low logwood
greenery

  in the semi-darkness the broad negro
voices hilarious with rum or furious with
rage and the constant squealing and bray-
ing of mules and donkeys contrasted oddly
with the mirroring sea from which the day-
breeze had fled against the dense blue
of the evening sky the palms rose as sten-
ciled things in mid-air the kling-kling
birds returning in pairs to the palm-crests
again beat out their anvil chorus but not
with the unanimous gusts of dawn

  already the rival steamers had appeared
the caribbeans amato first because it had
gained time through failure to get its quota
at the other ports along the coast the
amalgamateds haciendado was now in the
lagoon too her gun-ports were wide
open and the trusts handlers were passing
in thousands of bunches of bananas from
the wharf at the western end of the bay
pereiras loaders could be heard number-
ing the bunches for the checker in a sing-
song with doggerel rhymings

           bana-a-ana-four

          come gimme one mo-ore-o

           bana-a-ana-fi-ive

           ho boy look ali-ive-o

  the amato had not begun to load the
first whaleboat had just left the caribbeans
wharf and it would be some time before
hambridge could keep the passers as busy
as the stevedores desired to be things
were going badly

  earlier in the afternoon he had received
another dispatch from warden sr at port
maria

   amalgamated cleaning up everything all along
amato not half laden its up to you

  it was up to him yet what could he
do to save the company from sending a
half-laden steamer north for ordinarily
she cleared from rio hacha and go she
must with her perishable cargo ripening in
her holds but even if he captured every
bunch that came into rio hacha even if
he stole fruit regularly contracted to perei-
ra even if he assassinated the fat lavender-
soaked sponge and lifted his deliveries from
the gfeat god ananzi



the piled wharf still he could not hope to
fill the amato

  so he told the anxious supercargo who
came ashore from the amato the minute
she dropped her hook but he went to
work to do his best although somehow that
mysterious prescience followed him like a
shadow his pupil and guest warden
caught the fever of the game and went so
far as to leap himself to the drivers seat
of a newly arrived dray shoulder the pro-
prietor off and drive the load of bananas
into the caribbeans shed

  there he cried dismounting flushed
with battle i like this game buskat

  you-fool said hambridge thickly

you cant do that hes pereiras man
its contract fruit

  whats the odds hes turned a trick
or two on us alls fair-

  drive out that dray said the busha
to the negro planter who had picked him-
self up and was calling down anathema
upon de mad young buccra from obersea

  whats the matter with you de-
manded warden of his fathers employee

  nothing said hambridge with a queer
laugh

  he waved a hand to the spangled skies

  gods ins heavn-

he turned and walked slightly
unsteady toward the shack across
the way warden remained
stunned out of action hambridge the
best man the caribbean had the man his
governor chose for his example in the busi-
ness had been drinking

  no doubt the negro hands knew it and
slacked accordingly it seemed to warden
that most of them were drunk too no
wonder they did precisely what the
busha did he was a white man and could
do no wrong what he did was worthy
of emulation

  no wonder pereira was winning-had
won-banana hands up he would hate
to tell the governor of this but-he ought
to hambridge was the companys best
man ye gods drunk

  presently the busha came back there
was the curious grin on his face the
inane smirk of a man half-paralyzed by
liquor

  come on said warden thinking the
lapse might be merely temporary-a touch
of fever and consequent light-headedness

lets lean up against it well turn a
trick on that lavender chest yet

  whats the use gulped hambridge
slumping down on his bench he wins
-tax on bnanas anyway

  wins shouted warden his yankee
hatred of defeat cropping out not by a
darn sight and if youre that sort of
weak-spined rabbit-

  hardly knowing what he expected to
accomplish right away he grabbed a bunch
of bananas from the hands of one of the
negroes and- just as quickly dropped it
again he sprang back aghast the ne-
gro also leaped away

  from the bunch had dropped a huge
spider even larger than that which had dis-
mayed him in the shack

  spidah yelled the negro

  it was mitch-chell

  warden ashamed of the fact that the
bunch he had dropped had burst into three
pieces sprang with both feet upon the in-
sect intent upon vengeance he did not
miss that spider emerged from the im-
pact a flat mess of pulp and quivering
hairy legs

  now youve done it said the anglo-
jamaican overseer that settles it i
tell you- he hiccouped-mights well
a killed nancy this morning nancy heard
ya anway killed the luck that settl
zit ve killed a nanzi spider

  but busha- mitch-chell protested

  shut up-you shouted hambridge
glaring at his henchman

 but busha-

  will you close your black mouth
roared the busha get me a drink

  my god groaned warden the pupil
and he turned toward the shack in despair

  he would have to talk to the governor

  before he entered the shack he looked
back at the wharf-shed the chief runner
mitch-chell appeared to be arguing with
the busha hambridge had gripped the
negrp by the shoulders-possibly for sup-
port or in drunken affection-and he was
laughing in his face warden went to the
room in the shack where he had slept every
night for nearly a week-for no purpose
except to be alone with his thoughts the
first thing his eyes sought and found was
the ananzi spider of the morning still im-
pending over his cot

  it had not moved it was like a dead
insect fastened by some invisible web


adventu t

only the light of the hurricane lamp caught
two little gleaming points in its head

  he shuddered slightly he desired to
kill it attributing to the strange creature
somehow the ill-luck of the day desiring
more to slay it because hambridge seemed
to believe in its power that he himself was
half-inclined  bah

  he picked up one of his still sodden
bathing-shoes and balanced it for an accu-
rate shot but as he swung his arm a voice
thick with inebriation said behind him

  don do it musn do it ol fella

  warden gave the busha one contemptu-
ous look and hurled the shoe with all his
force the spider vanished the ameri-
can turned furiously upon the overseer
who was chuckling inanely hambridge
pointed waveringly to the opposite wall

  misshed said he

  there was the spider how it had got
over there whether it had leaped or-some
magic it seemed impossible yet there it
was

  the overseer reeled toward the wash-
stand he poured a half tumbler of liquid
from a black bottle which had stood there
and drained it off then he fairly col-
lapsed on his cot

  warden disgusted dismayed beyond
expression went out into the night a
fury raged in him he would not let his
dad lose because his dads trusted best man
had fallen down

  he took charge but he might as well
have followed the bushas example at least
in the matter of going to bed the hands
listened dully to his orders or quite ignored
them they too had slacked up they
too had been drinking they worked
slowly clumsily bunches of bananas were
dropped and shattered they pitched
other bunches into the whaleboat bruising
them against marketable possibility they
allowed dray after dray to run the gantlet
unchallenged the victorious pereira on
the other horn chuckled as he heard of the
doings

  soused-on banana day he said to
his chief runner never knew him take a
drink before even well its an ill wind-
my tally says twenty-two thousand
bunches how about yours amos

  as a last resort warden appealed to
mitch-chell the faithful upon him too
the spell of evil had descended he too
seemed more than half drunk

  wehfado buccra what else can we
do white man he said you no kill
nancy spidah buccra

the amalgamateds steamer iia-
ciendado cleared at midnight with
her holds full the caribbeans
amato cleared hours later with less than
half the cargo for which she had capacity
she headed back to port maria for in-
structions it had been a disastrous week
for the independents especially at rio
hacha pereira had exceeded his order
for fifteen thousand bunches by seven
thousand hambridge shipped only nine
thousand

  while the caribbeans hands finished
their debauch on the beach at the eastern
end of the bay and on the other horn
pereiras victors celebrated warden re-
turned to the shack tired disappointed
disgusted on the other cot lay the busha
apparently dead to the world by his side
was a broken chair and on it the black
bottle and a glass

  what was the man drinking anyway
the dregs in the glass were not red or brown
or amber but transparent and colorless
was it possible he had sunk secretly to the
last resort of the tropic tippler-gin

  sadly anxious to know the worst warden
tiptoed to the side of the man he had ad-
mired until that night he smelled of the
liquid in the glass it had no odor
neither had the remainder of it in the black
bottle he poured a few drops on the palm
of his left hand and touched it with the tip
of his tongue

  it was plain water yet 

p in the morning there was little

iiijki to be said the busha naturally
enough slept late warden took
his dip in the rio hacha alone

  pereira came around as usual after
banana day to talk it over offer to shake
hands and call it a deal for another week
on this occasion he expressed the sympathy
of good fellowship

  we all do it even the best of us at
times said he suppose you have a
hair of the dog hambridge

  no massa said hambridge gravely
i never touch the stuff

  pereira chuckled and helped himself
from the bottle he had brought along for
diplomatic use
the great god ananzi



  when warden came back from the river
he found them seated together quite friend-
ly talking over the setting of a turtle
net

  warden did not like it the dark
thought occurred that these two-alone so
much together-might be closer than he
had been led to believe that possibly the
amalgamated through pereira had bought
the bus ha into the secret service of the trust
he would certainly have a talk with the
governor

  after the late tropic breakfast warden
announced his intention of returning to
port maria the busha did not press him
to remain the farewells were rather awk-
ward warden felt he ought to be frank

  im sorry hambridge said he but
there were things last night i neednt say
more except that its clearly up to me as

my fathers son-

  go ahead said the busha wearily
when i make an ass of myself i bray but
dont kick its my funeral so long
when warden jr told warden sr of
the matter of which he felt he was bound to
speak the governors face expressed utter
disappointment and dismay

  if you werent my own son id call you
a liar said he but this explains yes-
terday ive been twisting my brain for
some explanation of the fall-down of rio
hacha we didnt expect hambridge to
raise twenty-two thousand bunches as
pereira did-he gets half that in contracted
fruit-but we did bank on twelve thous-
and maybe fifteen he was authorized to
go pereiras limit and then some i didnt
understand but now-hambridge drunk
and id meant to make him general man-
ager well ill give him a fair hearing
hambridge upon a summons to port
maria next day rode there huddled in his
saddle like a bag of loose bricks his face
was stamped with wo and his brow fur-
rowed with remorse possibly he had been
an ass a superstitious fool but ever since
that time he lost on the favorite in the
overseers sweepstakes he had been more
and more inclined to listen to that inward
voice no not voice that  what was
it the americans called it ah well it
didnt matter now

  it was therefore a much surprised over-
seer who walking listlessly into warden
srs office at port maria suddenly found
himself enclosed in that banana magnates

arms and being given a lesson in the two-step

  the busha backed off the head of the
independent company trod mincingly
around the office cackling like a gander
and waving a pink slip of paper

  go out and get drunk again ham-
bridge me boy he chanted chortlingly
go out and get paralyzed

  i never touch the stuff said the busha
his usual languid tones heavy with melan-
choly

  eh ejaculated warden sr but
there-thats all right dont discuss it
i wont luckiest thing ever happened
only dont do it again listen to this

  he started to read the cablegram but
broke off to explain in full what the laconic
words meant

  bottoms dropped out of the boom
banana market he declaimed tax on
bananas gone up in smoke constant
reader and pro bono publico and the
poor mans food and all that-killed it
before it was born markets hooded with
bananas to be sold at a loss by dealers
prices dropped through the basement

floor and-

  and- the busha chimed in leaning
forward with a great light in his eyes

  and roared warden sr the amal-
gamated has six steamers crammed to the
gunwales steaming seventeen knots to bal-
timore philadelphia new york and bos-
ton and theyll have to chuck the whole
caboodle overboard as theyve done be-
fore or further spoil the market the
caribbean loses only a poor half cargo on
the amato for the jacquelin and the por-
tuondo of our fleet couldnt make up and
turned over their fruit to the amato and
didnt sail at all

  imphm was the bushas comment
there was a queer look on his sun-
scorched face

  now as to my getting drunk-

not a word interrupted warden sr
as i say it was the luckiest thing ever

happened only-

  as to my getting drunk continued
hambridge lazily it was like this one
time i bet a months salary and a fifty-
dollar saddle on a sure thing in the over-
seers-

  oh can that old yam only-

  and ever since ive sort of leaned to a
bet on the possibility of a rank outsider
finishing first now i had a feeling-


adventure

  a hunch said warden sr becoming
grave at once

  much obliged said the busha re-
lieved ive been hunting that word for
nearly two days-a hunch i had a hunch
that that tax wouldnt go through and the
high prices of the last month and the way
weve been flooding the market meant-
you see my hunch was for its happening
this week between sailing and arriving in
the states-within these five days it was
such a strong-er-hunch then there
was a fool thing about a nancy spider-

  what about the ananzi spider asked
some one in the doorway

  it was warden jr a curious grin on his
face

  hullo warden said hambridge coolly
and went on maybe that was what got
me started your young man here missed
it with his boot and it stayed right in the
room all day maybe i pleaded for its life
and-maybe ananzi took a hand in grati-
tude

  warden sr was shaking with mirth
he knew the native-born jamaicans super-
stition about brer ananzi

  the nancy stayed in the room and i
got a feeling-a hunch-it had something
on its mind that it had a hunch too and
wanted to tip me off on a sure thing

  wien i got word how badly things were
going at the other ports i went to the shack
and had a long confab with brer nancy-
in my mind you know thats what was
on my mind turning to warden jr
fever be blowed and when you sug-
gested a drink-a thing i never do-it
occurred to me the only way to cover up a
lie-down before pereira was to get para-
lyzed  i drank so much water out of that
black bottle that after you left i had to go
over to sam chungs for a real drink-
something i never do

  it was just a-a hunch you see

  hmm there was a good deal of cold
reasoning behind that hunch said war-
den sr

  im sorry old man said warden jr
honest-i thought you were really-all
to the bad and-and i was disappointed
im frank and i want to apologize

  i meant you to think so said the busha
i meant everybody to think so-so it
would come straight to pereira even
mitch-chell believed it until i put him on
and thereafter he proceeded to demoralize
the whole handling staff

  but why pretend to be drunk at all
asked warden jr

  as i never touch the stuff the busha
drawled it was the only thing would ac-
count to pereira for my falling down he
would have been suspicious of anything else
and would have got a-a hunch maybe
that i had private information from head-
quarters a throw-down of the tax on
bananas would have been the first thing to
occur to him i didnt want him to put
that into the heads of the amalgamates at
port antonio i wanted em to go on buy-
ing-and they sure did i helped em all i
could

  but how can you give any credit to the
ananzi or my not killing it didnt i
smash one to pulp that time in the wharf-

shed

  oh that said hambridge with a queer
smile mitch-chell knew thats why
i had to shut him up sharp i wanted you
to think it was a nancy if it had been
id ha known we were really in bad that
was a tarantula

  your nancy is still doing business at
the same stand it was right on the ceiling
over my head last night when pereira sam
chung the police force and i had our little
weekly game sam chung has a mortgage
now on the constables horse and i stung
pereira for eighty-seven cold dollars
however when the busha was promoted
to the general managership at port maria
warden sr presented him with a seal ring
upon which was engraved the great god
ananzi in the shape of a spider somewhat
reduced
i saw him surveying the house with
great care until as if satisfied he put
his hand on the gate and tentatively
fumbled with the catch but having
gone so far he hesitated and i watching
him from behind window curtains intoler-
ant of strangers cordially hating all man-
ner of sellers of things and suspicious of
every one else found myself curiously
disappointed when he nervously took
his hand off the gate and began to walk
away

  an old man whom i knew at once for a
sailor he acted for all the world like a boy
who has a fault to confess and dreads the
consequences of his confession and as he
walked slowly away he kept turning his
head to look back so i went out to the
porch and sat down in the long cane chair
i keep there during fine weather and
he seeing me do this turned about and
walked toward the gate again his keen old
eyes taking in every detail of me although
he at no time allowed his scrutiny to develop
the rudeness of a stare

  then as i was wondering what he would
do next he threw open the gate with
startling abandon and began an extraor-
dinary progress up the path of my garden
while i tried to make a diagnosis from
his walk-at first inclining to tablets but
switching almost immediately to alcohol
because of the absence of certain indica-
tions of the former malady but suddenly
my shameful pathological promptings were
swept aside and half rising from my chair
i realized that the ragged vagabond caper-
ing so curiously up the path was performing

his involved gyrations from an excess of

pure joy

  what little thing is it that brings recog-
nition after many years the face of my
visitor was covered with a ragged growth
obliterating the trim mustache memory
looked for and the weird dance of his un-
dignified approach bravely tried to hide a
knee-tremble which was an unkindly
stranger to the husky young irishman who
had taught me to steer and his rags and
the sorry existence they proclaimed as he
careered along with but a pitiful physical
echo of the jocularly active brennan whom
i knew before lifes bubbles lost their colors
and most of them burst and by what un-
canny methods had he found me

  i had his hand and our eyes met bash-
fully-as if all the things we had done since
we last saw each other were watching us
making us diffident and we did not at first
speak finding our throats very dry but
there would be much to tell and i would
listen as i did when a boy to his tales in
that last word lurks the courtesy due a guest

  he teetered just a bit from weariness as i
led him inside where he took off his nonde-
script hat with the respectful politeness of
the sailor going aft to the cabin and he
admired my bits of things with that silent
flattery which is instinctive with the irish
but unknown to any other race then we
drank as yet wordless because there was so
much to say that neither of us knew where
to begin

  and how did you find me-by acci-
dent i asked after we had beamed at
cach other for several minutes



author of the tide-mating taste of the sail etc
o

adventure

  he had about him-exuded it in fact-
something more than a mere atmosphere of
heavily tarred rigging and strange old car-
goes of dead and gone sailing ships the
mystery and magic of the sea enfolded him
so that he might have been a goodly com-
pany of seafaring men woven cunningly into
one personality yet with every strand of the
weave showing distinctly-coming from the
loft of eternity to the measuring loom of
time drakes men hawkins men pirates
adventurers and decent seamen these
looked at me from the back of his eyeg when
he grinned

  as to that it was easy i meets an old
shipmate-hadnt seen him for years-and
we gets to talking he was after he told
me with a scheme he had to catch a sub-
marine alive before the square-headed
crew of her could destroy the innards of her
out of shape so to speak a reward he
tells me hell get for the catching of one
by and by your name comes up

  i smiled back at him brushing aside the
memory of the weaknesses that had brought
him to his pathetic age remembering only
that once he had been my ideal and that
always he had been ray friend

  that would be ted gillet i answered
he left here when the state went dry
an old old man for such a job-if he
meant it

  so i came along added brennan lu-
minously of course ted told me about
you and where you lived but him being
such a liar always i had to come along here
to see for myself

  and very welcome i said

  ye were a small boy at sea and me
showing ye the ropes he went on after
lighting his pipe and how long is it
now

  oh it must be thirty-five years i ad-
mitted

  and ye remember it all

  i do you began instructing me by
explaining how it was the stars in the china
sea moved around the world the opposite
way to what they do in the atlantic
and the fight i trained ye for he asked
eagerly

  yes i remembered for it brought me fine
weather but that brennan should have
dragged it up-oh well he is brennan
now i wonder will you think as i do often
that coincidence lifted a corner of the veil
that night and showed me reality

it happened in liverpool with
me hardened to a most plebeian
toughness the ship lying in the
herculanean dock and brennan running
aboard with much excitement and a few
drinks in him to find me

  ive been ashore he made needless ex-
planation now barney me boy lay
aside your book and get out of your bunk
for a blessed minute-its a teacher of school
yell be some day thats sure-and listen
to me will ye

  i put the book under my pillow and at-
tended with the gravity befitting what
promised to be a matter of importance

   its a fight he plunged to finality

  boijks were as far as the moon borne
away by the atavistic tidal wave raised by
the vision of combat

  between- i asked getting out of my
bunk quickly

  you and a red-headed feller he ex-
plained

  oh i answered looking at the door of
the forecastle and expecting it to frame my
antagonist

  a real proper fight with a referee and
all went on brennan interpreting my look
sit down and ill tell ye

  so we sat down on the wooden chest con-
taining his few belongings and he talked
zestfully

  he works for the keeper of a public
house just a bit off paradise street at
swabbing floors and washing glasses and the
like a bit unhealthy he looks but oh
the ugly face of him the ugly face and the
red head of him-fighting signs me boy
youve a lot of training to do with me for
your trainer ive bet ten shillings on ye
and the spectators will make up a purse as
its called of three or four bob for the
winner a hard ugly face he lias-but ill
have ye in condition

  when is it to be i asked

  this very night replied brennan

  to his racial peculiarities brennan added
a topsey-turvy fasliion of doing things that
was all his own but he was too much my
ideal sailor for me to utter criticism yet i
may have ventured a suggestion concerning
my condition and the lack of any need of
even the startlingly intensive training he
planned for me but he was decided

  fights he had known in plenty but never
such a fight as this usually he had been a
principal a more than willing combatant
maze of memory



but now he was an organizer a director a
trainer a second a man of functions and
this was no common fight-no mere differ-
ence of opinion followed by a blow and a
struggle among cuspidors and mens feet
on a barroom floor

  no this was to be a well-conducted con-
test with-had he not told me-a watch for
the keeper of time a referee certain wagers
and a purse for the winner and was not
training the invariable preliminary to all
such deliberate entertainments was
then a small matter like shortness of time
to be allowed to upset a well-established
custom would we let the keeper of the
public house the referee and all the other
patrons of sport think us ignorant

  brennan was very serious and there
was the other side of it did he not want
to do the best for me and how could i
fight my best if i were not trained i was
not sure myself and my vague notions
respecting time were dissipated by his
earnestness only there did seem to be
something wrong about training for a fight
a few hours away but who was i to argue
and hurt his feelings besides if it hadnt
been for him there wouldnt have been any
fight and no fight meant no purse of three
or four shillings

  three or four shillings would buy a lot of
second-hand books and brennan might
be right after all of course i was big and
strong and had taught myself to read al-
most all the words in my precious books
but-i was only a bit over fifteen and
brennan was a man he must know best
train i would and we had the ship to
ourselves for the officers and crew were
ashore

  i felt that brennan would have liked to
have an audience but there was only the old
night-watchman puffing a contemplative
pipe over the galley door and watching our
performance with a face expressive of the
utmost approval

  the shadows gathered as i trained-
around the deck as fast as i could run and
up and down the rigging almost as rapidly
-until the few lanterns that flickered about
the dock told that the night of adventure
was upon us the day-time voice of the
city had hushed to a soothing undertone
the smoke of the many chimneys was drift-
ing out to sea in fantastic shapes which it
would never again assume and i utterly
exhausted was fed with mastodonic zeal

and played with advice that i regarded as
cunning beyond price

  then hardly able to move i was assisted
to my bunk where i at once fell asleep

  shades of an ultra-perfect digestion and
an imagination as little likely to trouble as a
faitliful dog to bite an hour later i was
awakened and i awoke reluctantly-so
tired and sleepy that even the lure of dis-
figuring another human had no attraction
for me and with brennan in the smelly
dimly lit forecastle was the night-watchman
shrilling unheeded reminiscences in the
cracked treble of age about the gory battles
in which he himself had had a hand

  an examination into my physical condi-
tion followed the result of which afforded
entire satisfaction to both my trainer and
his ancient admirer often in the light of
the knowledge of further years did i muse
upon the method of that examination find-
ing a fascination in its uniqueness-as if
testing the fitness of a horse about to run a
race the color of its tail was the crucial
consideration yet i was genuinely glad
that brennan found no fault in me and that
the night-watchmans toothless comments
rose to the shrill exclamation that he
wouldnt mind betting a shilling on me
himself that he wouldnt

  so what wonder if i took on new dignity
as i dressed to go ashore-a dignity that a
chill drizzle pattering in a melancholy way
into the water of the dock and dripping dis-
mally off everything else in no wise ruffled
or upset the gaunt masts and rigging of
many ships looked an impartial understand-
ing out of their own stressful fives the
watchman waved his smoky lantern and i
set out upon my crusade with my squire
carrying a pair of swimming trunks-the
armor in which i was to fight

  and indeed i felt something of knight-
hood in my attitude toward the affair spite
of the victors wreath being a matter of
three or four shillings for was i not content
to fight without question out of sheer loy-
alty to my rather erratic friend who had
shown his faith in me by what to him was a
large wager could i imagine keener joy
than that coming from his pat on the back
of gratitude when he pocketed the money i
had won for him

  and the prospect of the fight itself was no
mean delight and every step of our muddy
progress brought its thrill of anticipation
little fun had life offered me-no school no


adventure

playmates never a show or a party-
what wonder then that i became as happy
and excited at the thought of what was
before me as a luckier child would have been
on the way to a circus

  but brennan did not guess my state of
mind perhaps i seemed thoughtful for i
saw him glancing at me furtively whenever
we passed under a street lamp and he began
to regale me with funny stories told with a
nervous haste that betrayed his fear of my
mental condition-something which even
his system of training could not take care
of-the while he pushed his way through
the crowds with an eye to my protection
from the jostling drunkenness of both sexes

  his solicitude pleased and flattered me
indeed i strutted swelling slightly at my
unusual importance-for i had no memory
of ever having been of greater consequence
than a fathom of rope or a pot of paint

a few yards past the grotesquely
abominable museum of anat-
omy we turned down a dingy side-
street that had no lamps of its own and into
which the lights of the main thoroughfare
hardly penetrated it was a very narrow
place uneven cobblestones under foot and
no sidewalk

  two gin-sodden women veritably flung
themselves at us hiccuping hello
dearie like two cuckoo clocks they
clawed at us as they swayed and brennan
grabbed my hand and hurried me along the
women laughing jarringly after us crea-
tures of a bat-like repulsiveness brushed
past us others leaned against the walls with
a lack of movement that was mummy-like
their baleful eyes watching with the inhu-
manity of devilfish

  brennan muttered an explanation which
i did not catch and presently we reached a
wooden door which he pushed open to ad-
mit us to the back yard of the public house
a place littered with empty casks bottles
straw and packing-cases through which
raffle we made our way to the door of the
cellar where my friend paused and put a
hand on my shoulder he loomed up wetly
in the gloom and his voice trembled
slightly as if he were cold

  ye aint afraid are ye barney he
asked

  of course not i answered not quite
truthfully for the latter part of the walk
had made me nervous

  its the quick way of me to settle
things between two drinks me boy with-
out so much as your leave but ye dont
mind do ye

  of course not i repeated shaking the
rain from my cap

  and ye dont feel-ye feel all right
  yes

  then with a rather feeble laugh lets
go in out of the wet

  he knocked on the door but nobody
answered so he knocked again more
loudly and then we heard footsteps and
the drawing of bolts and the door opened
widely enough for a head to protrude and
break the uncanny secrecy of the perform-
ance by asking what we wanted

  its us whispered brennan

  a gust of wind blew a spluttering of rain
and the head swore

  and who in-is us

  me and the boy for the fight explained
my companion

  oh said the head withdrawing itself
to open the door why didnt you say
that at first come in

  we entered what felt like a narrow pass-
age and the owner of the place-for the man
who had opened the door was this impor-
tant person-fumblingly replaced hi bolts
and bars panting obesely as he did so it
was as dark as a tomb and smelt horribly
i shivered for many reasons and was
cheered but little when the saloon-keeper lit
a piece of candle which he produced from
somewhere about his person after a series of
grunts-each grunt indicating a different
place of search

  i looked at him apprehensively in the
little light he can be simply described
as a selfish mass of fat impregnated with
villainy he started to paw me with a
beastly hand but i shuddered away from
him

  scared eh he sneered

  i did not answer so he turned to bren-
nan who stood regarding the brute with
that species of awe which partially par-
alyzes the bird shows it when the cat
approaches certain animals bow before the
snake because of it and the old-time sailor
always manifested it when in the presence
of the crimp or saloon-keeper both of whom
made their living by robbing him bren-
nan answered servilely and i felt shocked

  you say he aint sixteen the saloon-
keeper grunted
maze of memory



  just a bit over fifteen replied brennan
with a deprecating giggle

  - exclaimed the other hes ugly

enough for twenty

  brennan laughed loudly and seemed de-
lighted that the other appreciated his
laughter

  and wheres your boy he asked show-
ing pride in the saloon-keepers toleration of
his tentative familiarity

  oh i never lets him out till the fight is
ready to start hes that fierce that if he
saw your boy hed jump at him and tear
him to bits and then there wouldnt be
no fight

  again brennan laughed his care for me
forgotten he laughed until the fat man
hushed him with a reminder about the
police who were very active at suppressing
these illegal fights-hence the cellar then
they turned and walked down the passage
together and i trailed along behind physi-
cally and spiritually sick keeping back my
tears with a great effort

  the saloon-keeper opened another door
and the place of battle flared before us lit
with lanterns strung from the floor above
and along the walls a small-far-too-
small-ring without any padding occu-
pied the center of the cellar and crowded
around it upon a heterogeneous collection of
seats were about two dozen men who were
varying the monotony of smoking by spit-
ting generously upon that part of the floor
where presently i would have to stand and
fight

  we were greeted by what the parlia-
mentary reports call cheers and laughter
and i shrank under the unkindly curiosity
of the spectators whose attention was un-
necessarily directed to my unhappy self by
the owner of the place-

  eres the fighter he announced

  then he said something to brennan which
i did not hear and my second beckoned
me to follow him to a comer of the room
where i shiveringly undressed and put on
the swimming-trunks after wringing the
rain out of them as well as i could of
course i had no rubber shoes only my
clumsy every-day affairs but brennan
did not appear to notice this need or
perhaps he did not know that they were
needed

  yet i tried to smile at him finding no
hate in me and-oh well we all revolve
within our limitations the years have mel-

lowed the memories and the seed of early
association has grown into a friendship that
finds nothing to forgive

  then a burst of real cheering announced
the entrance of my antagonist and i looked
over at him startled and much afraid
brennan had said that he was ugly and his
description was not unkind the saloon-
keeper had said that i was ugly enough for
twenty i do not flatter myself but using
the same method of calculation the boy i
was about to fight must have been nearly a
thousand and he was at least twenty
pounds heavier

  then brennan led me back to the ring
leaving my one poor suit as a careless offer-
ing to any thief that unpleasant gathering
might contain and i found myself sitting
on an up-ended box waiting for the end of
the world and hoping it wouldcome quickly
the main events of my unhappy little life
came before me and i had not felt so miser-
able since somebody stole the barrel in
which for three weeks i had once made my
home for brennan was the one friend i
had known the only human being from
whom i could remember receiving any sign
of affection any sort of kindness and now
he had denied me for the laughter of a
saloon-keeper

at the opposite comer sat my
rugged opponent attended by his
seconds-two young fellows like
himself posturing with what they obviously
regarded as the correct amount of tough-
ness the spectators were pridefully ad-
vertising their friendship for the boy i was
to fight with vociferous questions concern-
ing his health and to these questions he re-
turned the properly condescending replies
but after some minutes of this they became
silent and i found myself the object of their
wordless appraisement

  i tried to look back at them all not to
show my courage but with the vague vain
hope of finding just one spark of pity which
perhaps might lead them to let me off-
my body shaking with the mixed emotions
of a schoolboy about to be publicly
thrashed and a felon waiting to be hanged
but there was no pity only regret that i did
not appear to be enough of a fighter to make
the affair interesting

  then brennan patted me timidly on the
back and i felt that he was sorry for what
he had done so i warmed to him like a


adventure

hungry dog grateful to the one foot in a
crowd that does not kick him

  there was a slight disturbance at the
back of the crowd where some steps led to
the bar above and the saloon-keeper ap-
peared half-supporting a tall thin man with
a huge mustache who was evidently very
drunk but whose dress and an indefinable
something proclaimed the gentleman-a
proclamation which the extreme deference
of the owner of the house corroborated
with some difficulty this person was as-
sisted to a seat at the ringside where he im-
mediately fell asleep

  captain blake the referee announced
the saloon-keeper pulling out his watch
with the intimation that he would keep time
and look after the refereeing until the cap-
tain felt better an arrangement to which
no one offered any objection-for after all
the fight was merely a show to amuse the
customers of the place into buying more
drinks from the two frowsy potmen who
were kept busy navigating through the fog
of tobacco smoke

  blake had probably offered to referee in a
moment of drunkenwhimsy and the saloon-
keeper anxious to oblige a good customer
had accepted the offer regarding the ap-
pointment as a distinctly humorous for-
mality and using it as an added lure for bren-
nans bet of ten shillings for it is unlikely
that any of the spectators saw any necessity
for having a referee and some of them saw
no need for a timekeeper-prefering to see
me beaten to a pulp without the minute
rests between punishments but the major-
ity were of a more epicurean leaning with
esthetic tastes demanding a more lingering
brutality

  only brennan found a glimmering of
doubt regarding the ethical status of this
dual official and doubtless feeling that his
cordial reception at the cellar door entitled
him to intimacy he approached the saloon-
keeper smiling deprecatingly and timidly
whispered his objection adding as his rea-
son for speaking a laughing but most un-
diplomatic reference to the ten shillings-
which by the way he had not only bet with
the saloon-keeper but also with child-like
faith had put up with him

  ho shouted the master of the cere-
monies loudly wot is it

  in the dead silence that naturally followed
brennan murmured something about the
double job being too much for one man

  speak up bellowed the saloon-keeper
making great pretense of listening with a
hand cupped over an ear speak up i
carnt ear yer

  but brennan could not speak up or
otherwise under the leering gaze of every
man in the place except the sleeping blake
he flushed and shuffled his feet uneasily
then with a pitiful effort to appear uncon-
cerned he returned to his place behind me
the saloon-keeper winking elaborately to the
crowd and raising an appreciative laugh
for brennan so far as the owner of the place
was concerned had long ceased to exist and
the wager had changed hands when the
money had changed pockets

  it was always thus with brennans type
ashore in a ships forecastle not only
would their positions have been reversed
but the fat man would have been washing
brennans place after meals-out of sight of
land that is now my friend was as help-
less as a shanghaied sailor in the power of
the crimp and he tried to hide his ignominy
by whispering plaintively to me

  the referee me boy is a real gentleman
-hell see ye get fair play once he was an
officer in the army-just a bit of a habit he
had of cheating at cards was what got him
put out so-

  but his doubtful testimonial was inter-
rupted by the saloon-keeper who called
time and waved his hand expressively
then i saw my opponent dancing toward me
in fighting attitude-i forgot to mention
that it was a bare fist fight-and all that
i knew of right and wrong bade me get up
and meet him but i was unable to move
i sat helpless not so much from fear-al-
though fear was but half-suppressed-as
from a strange pity that suddenly grew into
a most extraordinary fondness for every one
in that cellar the result of the emotional
storm i had been through i craved affec-
tion not contest

  and my opponent was coming nearer-
he had almost reached the center of the ring
-but still i could not move my thoughts
were racing past my ego like hurricane-torn
clouds driving across the face of the moon
the dreams of my very earliest years
whirled up from the dark horizon of forget-
fulness and i wondered again why i had
been put into a world for which i had no
desire i forgot became oblivious to my
surroundings

  the fact of another humans intention to
maze of memory



beat me up became as relatively unim-
portant as it was absolutely so the hoarse
roaring of the spectators was the wind in
the rigging and it was soothing i was
very sleepy and i would go to sleep yes
i would sleep and perhaps i would not be
obliged to wake up any more

  but there was a discordant note in the
wind and because of that discord i could
not sleep i tried to ignore it but it per-
sisted with devilish insistency and then
i made out that it was brennans voice
howling and patting my back as he howled

  up at him barney and scatter every
feature of his face

  at that i jumped to my feet and made
for my opponent who had just reached the
center of the small ring i had no wish to
fight and i was still a bit dazed and i
looked at the red-headed boy with the for-
lorn friendliness of a stray puppy he
laughed at me dropping his hands in-
sultingly whereupon the saloon-keeper who
was still in the ring also laughed and the
jovial spectators added their hilarity to the
general mirth now even a dog resents
being laughed at

  a cold anger stiffened my spine cleared
my tired brain and added strength to my
ijody an ancient ancestor-lent me his stone-
age ferocity the cruelty of those who had
long been dust stirred my ijlood and a cu-
riously pleasant determination to smash the
ugly face of my antagonist became the sole
reason of existence he leaned toward me
tauntingly his hands by his sides and as his
vile breath puffed into my face i jabbed him
viciously on the nose-the sudden spurt of
blood cheering me more than anything i
had ever seen he hit back and his blow
landed somewhere but i felt no pain so
we stood toe to toe slugging at each other

u i i must imagine that the specta-
prg tors were surprised and that the
saloon-keeper nearly dropped his
watch in astonishment for i was too busy
to notice them but the pained grunts of my
opponent were not imaginary nor was the
change that underwent his expression-not
only that of blood and bruises but the
change from the grinning leer of confidence
to the dawning fear of possible defeat

  he stepped back and i followed then he
desperately drove at me until he bore me by
sheer weight to my corner getting home a
terrific blow on my left eye which almost

blinded me then for some time we struggled
in a clinch the referee making no attempt
to separate us because i was at a disad-
vantage owing to my being the lighter

  but in spite of brennans training i was
in the better condition by far even with
his extra weight my opponent tired of the
wrestling before i did and at last he
loosened his hold on me and stepped back
dropping his guard as he did so seeing my
opportunity i drove my fist into that part
of his body where ribs cease to be ribs-
where flesh is weak and had my full
strength been behind it that blow would
have ended the fight but as i hit him his
fist hit my biceps and the power of my
punch was lessened

  nevertheless it looked as if he would col-
lapse his knees sagged inward his head
dropped forward and so sure was i that all
was over that i stepped back without the
finishing blow i could have so easily given
then he pluckily straightened and began
to retreat too late i followed excitedly
hitting at him with far more energy than
skill making most remarkable swings at his
head more often than not missing that
ugly aim by a foot and forgetting all about
the vulnerable portion of his anatomy i had
recently disturbed

  why hadnt i finished him when i had
the chance why had i held back-wasnt
i there to beat him up was i going to let
him win and so on-i prodded myself
into a sort of desperation forgetting what
little boxing i knew but utterly changed
from the scared child who had come into
that cellar twice i bumped into the
saloon-keeper who had cast aside the dig-
nities of timekeeper and referee and who
was exhorting his boy with the zeal of both
backer and second-the boy responding by
swinging at me as wildly as-i swung at him
and making about as many hits

  it was a frantic scene with the spectators
on their feet yelling advice and criticism
dropping pipes and upsetting beer mugs
hands waving fists pounding palms

  sometimes i got a glimpse of their faces
gibbering like strangely pale baboons at the
bars of a cage with the uncertain fog of
smoke billowing fantastically occasion-
ally i slipped and occasionally the other
boy slipped but a curious chivalry grew be-
tween us so that neither hit when the other
was on his knees

  but i could see that the saloon-keeper


adventure

could hardly keep from hitting at me him-
self and knew that at the first chance he
would do something foul to defeat me
and here i must give credit to my antag-
onist for once when his boss told him com-
manded him to hit me when i was down he
found something in his soul which told that
obese brute to go to-

  the noise increased and wilder became
our boxing it seemed ages since i had
drawn a satisfactory breath and my
throbbing heart was reaching up into my
throat the lights swayed uncertainly
and my opponents ghastly bloody face
was as difficult to hit as that of the chief
devil in a nightmare the arcs described
by our swinging fists became smaller and
the fists themselves took on the weight of
cannon-balls

  amid my physical distress i found myself
wondering if my face was as badly mauled
as that of the red-headed boy then as if
both of the same mind we fell into a clinch
sobbing not breathing upon each others
shoulder and through the tumult of voices
came that of the saloon-keeper-

  time

  instead of three minutes we must have
been fighting for ten and whether he
stopped us because we could fight no longer
or because he was afraid the noise would
bring the police is something i have never
decided with uncertain steps i stag-
gered in the general direction of brennan
but instead of taking the box he hastily
pushed forward for me to sit upon i lay
down upon that indescribably dirty stone
floor finding it as delicious a haven as ever
offered by a feather bed

  and my unexpected success had won me
some adherents half-conscious i knew
that a pillow of empty sacks was being put
under my buzzing head that rough hands
were lifting my brusied body tenderly and
laying another sack between it and the
floor and that brennan was fanning me with
amateurish vigor and the tails of my shirt
but i also knew that no power either in
heaven or in earth could get me in shape to
continue the fight at the end of the pre-
scribed interval of one minute

  i need not have concerned myself for the
saloon-keeper had no intention of allowing
his duty as timekeeper to interfere with the
workings of his natural affection for his
protege he was swearing horribly at the
unfortunate boy because i was as yet un-

licked while the two seconds rubbed and
fanned him but several minutes passed
without his showing any interest in his
watch and i knew that the red-headed one
would be allowed to fully recover before the
next round

  but the spectators were impatient they
wanted to see somebody beaten properly
and the delay annoyed them it was noth-
ing to them if the saloon-keepers boy was
licked there were other saloon-keepers
with fighting boys who sold as good beer
for the same price and as my strength and
wind came back to me until i felt almost as
well as i had done before the fight i under-
stood what i had hitherto been ignorant of

  competition was keen between the differ-
ent public houses of the district and price-
cutting having gone the limit some sort of
attraction was required to get the business
hence these fighting boys every saloon-
keeper had one and the red-headed boy had
proven the best of them all therefore he
was a valuable asset and his boss did a
bigger business than his rivals

  it was all very simple- had i looked to
have had a chance we would have been told
at the cellar door that the fight was off and
now that i was more than holding my own
every dirty trick would be tried to defeat
me the red-headed boy lacked my con-
dition and the spectators were booing and
whistling like the audience in the gallery of
a theater for the show to continue

  time-call time yelled one large-
lunged individual at the ring side

  taint quite time yet replied the
saloon-keeper placatingly his pig-like eyes
looking in my direction with an illuminating
malevolence

  call time the other yelled back at him
call-

  then suddenly the bibulous but some-
times benevolent god of the chances
prompted him and he leaned over and
shook captain blakes shoulder

  ere youre the referee aint yer make
em fight and he laughed heartily the
crowd laughing with him and the saloon-
keeper readily grasping the opportunity for
further delay

  lor bui youre the funny one he
wheezed youu be the death of me yet

  and the funny one greatly encouraged
again prodded the captain who stirred un-
easuy and then opened liis eyes and looked
about him evidently sober after his sleep
maze of memory



i was sitting up by now ready to
go on and the captains eyes rested
on me for a moment and mine
dropped-that is the one i could see out of
did-for i had never seen such wonderful
eyes masterful eyes that men obey and
when he looked around that motley assem-
bly it suddenly became quiet

  what were you saying he asked his
cool cultured voice rendered the more no-
ticeable by the environment

  i were asking you to make em fight
sir said bill very politely youre the
referee sir

  oh yes-of course-forgot about it
drawled blake getting to his feet leisurely
and adjusting a monocle i thank you for
reminding me

  yes sir-thank you sir replied the
subdued bill

  of course this happened in the late
eighties when the impalpable mantle of
caste brought a homage to its wearer that is
less in evidence in the england of today
yet blake was a man to command respect
anywhere when he was sober and the easy
way he obtained obedience in that cellar was
not surprising-the unusual with its more
than a hint of life-tragedy lay in his being
there at all in his non-association with his
kind in his spending his time and income in
the private bar of the public house seeking
the most holy grail of forgetfulness

  he looked at the ring with a frown of dis-
gust and hailing one of the hurrying pot-
men ordered him to bring a sack of the
sawdust used to sprinkle the floor of the bar-
room and spread it on the floor of the ring

  men can not fight on that slippery
dirt he said and besides im going to
referee inside american fashion

  he wiped his hands fastidiously and fas-
cinated me by tucking his handkerchief up
his sleeve and the potman having spread
the sawdust-the spectators watching with
admiring silence-he stepped into the ring

  well briggs he asked whats the
delay

  taint quite time yet sir answered
the saloon-keeper

  yes it is yelled the crowd make
em fight sir 

   the voice of the people you know
briggs said the captain so youre
keeping time

  yes sir briggs voice was full of some
emotion

  all right-get out of the ring

  sir

  get out of the ring

  all right sir obeying slowly its all
in your hands sir

  call time then

  briggs obeyed and again the red-headed
boy and myself stood toe to toe slugging at
each other with more energy than skill
now unless he expected to get me with a
lucky punch i could see no reason for his
wasting his strength with this continued
swinging it was obvious that i was in the
better condition and that if he kept at it
at this rate he would tire out and be at my
mercy that was my job then-to make
him waste his strength with these wild
swings keep out of danger and wait for my
opportunity it was very simple

  so we whaled away at each other blake
watching us carefully and the spectators
yelling their appreciation but this did not
last long as i had expected my opponent
began to back away from me showing every
sign of weariness while i was fairly com-
fortable i followed him still swinging and
occasionally getting home lightly and
then he backed against the ropes his head
lolling tiredly i had him

  he wavered his hands dropped and i
steadied myself for the final blow next
moment came the realization that i was a
second or two too late for the other boy
straightened up and putting all his remain-
ing strength into the blow beat me to the
punch-getting home on the point of my
chin-and i landed in a quivering heap on
the trampled sawdust

  but i was not out and i felt no pain
only i was so angry at myself for falling
into so simple a trap that i could have cried

  over me captain blake was counting and
his was the only voice in the cellar except
that of brennan who was putting up some
wonderful prayer to the numerous queer
deities of his acquaintance

  but i was puzzled why was the cap-
tain counting me out couldnt he see that
i could get up as soon as i wanted to did
he think i was hurt why i was all right
i would just he there for a little while and
rest up

  five-six

  this was absurd and everybody watch-
ing me and so quiet too of course i knew
that a man was beaten when ten seconds
were counted over him but that meant a


adventure

hurt man-i was not hurt-i could get up

if i wanted to

  seven

  there he went again one thing about
it the seconds seemed to be long ones like
those when one is half-asleep but it was
all rot surely the captain knew that the
red-headed boy couldnt hit hard enough
to hurt me

  eight

  barney barney-get up get up

  oh well i thought drowsily suppose i
must how often had brennan roused me
to go on deck like this when i wanted to
sleep awful nuisance but must get up
i yawned

  nine

  i dont remember getting to my feet i
felt the fist of my opponent swing past my
head without touching and then the im-
petus of his blow carried him into me and i
clung desperately

  break-break commanded blake

  still i hung on

  the captain tried to pry us apart

  its time i shouted more than
three minutes

  blake pulled out his watch and looked
sternly at the saloon-keeper who wilted
under that look and called time i
stumbled into brennans arms and was
eased down upon the kindly sacks

  so blake was saying you let the
time pass want your boy to win eh
after this ill keep time myself a little
more nerve briggs and you would have
succeeded-i hadnt looked at my watch for
hours until just now

  i really wasnt much hurt although i
heartily wished for more than one minute
rest and when the captain totally ignoring
the saloon-keeper called time i had no
trouble stopping the rushes of the red-
headed boy and presently i felt that he was
far more tired than i was

  but now i was not swinging-contenting
myself with blocking and waiting for a cer-
tain opening and at last it came the other
boy dropped his guard for a moment and i
hit him again where ribs end and he sank
groaning to the floor apparently all in it
happened so suddenly that it looked like a
fluke and perhaps it was but i was not
worried by that i was too pleased to hear
the captain counting over somebody else to
care how that somebody came to be counted
over

but that boy was plucky and
when he struggled to his feet at the
count of nine i felt sorry for him
only a few minutes before he thought he
had won and my youthful health had
cheated him besides his very existence
depended upon his winning while to me the
fight was but an incident an experience to
remember and talk about he staggered
pathetically as he got up and the specta-
tors held their breath waiting for the finish

  i didnt want to do it i saw no reason
why i should hit the poor devil again he
was a stranger to me and somehow i
had grown to like him why take away his
living then and then i remembered
brennans ten shillings and the purse of
three or four bob of which i had seen no
evidence

  since i had entered that cellar the
changes of years had passed over me i had
come to understand that certain things
must be done however much we may dis-
like doing them and however much we
may wonder why the absolute should allow
conditions which make it necessary we
should do them

  now it was necessary that i should re-
duce that red-headed boy to a condition
where he could fight no more i put up my
hands

  a few feet away my opponent stood
swaying on sagging legs i made a step
toward him and then the saloon-keeper lost
control of himself and deliberately pushed
his foot into the ring and tripped me
heavily

  it was the rottenest trick i had ever seen
and i was mad clear through i forgot the
red-headed boy turned round hearing a
babble of voices and hit the saloon-keeper
in the middle of his fat face

  that was the most comforting blow i ever
struck but it had the most extraordinary
results one of those causeless panics
which occur in herds of humans and other
cattle was the consequence and it all hap-
pened so rapidly that to tell about it is
difficult

  the red-headed boy seems to have started
it whether he thought that my striking
his boss was a sort of sacrilege or whether
it was his notion of the end of the earth or
whether he knew that mr briggs temper
for some hours would be a thing best
avoided and consequently lost his head in
his haste to escape i know not let it be
maze of memory



simply told that he dived under the ropes
with more activity than i thought he had
left shouting at the top of his voice-

    police-police-help-murder  

  he forgot to shout fire but even with
that omission the cellar cleared with start-
ling rapidity i seemed to hear the cap-
tain telling the saloon-keeper that he was a
dirty rotter then came a noise like a ship
being dismasted in a cyclone-the disturb-
ance of the heterogeneous collection of
seats impeding a frantic audience doubtless
-and then there was nobody there but the
captain brennan and myself the crowd
had left nothing but its odor

  well drawled blake what a rout-
what a bally routl

  but what was the matter sir asked
brennan somewhat agitated

  the captain shrugged his shoulders

  you saw as much as i did mobs are
like that and so sometimes are armies

   i began to dress feeling rather blue if
the spectators had gone where would my
purse of three or four shillings come from-
presuming that my opponents running
away implied my victory i mentioned
this to brennan adding rather plaintively
that i would not be able to buy the books
i so badly needed

  what broke in blake books-is it
books you want boys dont usually
tell me about it

  brennan explained with some enthusiasm
somewhat proud of his ability as an or-
ganizer but dubious concerning his skill as a
collector would the captain be so kind as
to teh him how he was going to get his ten
shillings from mr briggs

  so answered blake this boy is not
your son

  no sir replied brennan laughing
hes a boy on our ship his parents are
dead

   yes sir i amplified my father was a
captain in the army like yourself when i
was a year old my mother and father were
killed in a carriage mother was driving
and the horses ran away-over a cliff i
lived with my aunt till i was ten then i ran
away from her

  what is your name and what was your
fathers regiment asked the captain rap-
idly his voice shaking

   i told him and he put his arm around me

he was greatly agitated and his whole body
trembled for some minutes we stood like
this silent blake staring into the shadowy
corner of the cellar then suddenly he
turned furiously upon brennan

  so he said taking his arm from me
and shaking his fist at brennan so you
subjected this boy this son of a dead lady
to this vile outrage in order that you might
win ten shillings did you

   brennan hadnt looked at it in that light
and he tried to stammer some sort of an
explanation but the captain cut him short

  its in the mind of me to give you in
charge his irish increasing with his anger
its six months with hard labor youve
earned

  i dont think he meant any harm-and i
wanted to win the books i broke in

   of course yed be loyal he said gently
but ye dont understand he smiled at
me then turned again to brennan get
out of here and dont let me see your face
again you and your dirty ten shillings
go now and brennan went looking
very shamefaced

    was very much mystified and not a little
embarrassed and uncomfortable as i went
on with my dressing with the captain watch-
ing me-his hard masterful eyes filled with
a yearning that was painful

  ye may think its calling the kettle
black i am he said suddenly

  i had no answer to this for my life had
told me to consider drunkenness from its
funny side besides in those days it was
too fashionable to be frowned upon as it is
today

  but he continued with apparent irrel-
evance dont ye believe them when they
tell you that its the bad women that send
men to hell its losing a good one that
does that

  there was a noise of argument in the bar
overhead

   i think your friend is trying to get his
ten shillings said captain blake he
must want it mighty bad by the way
what do you want most in all the world
enough to eat a place to live in away
from ships and all the books i can read
sir i answered promptly

  well now said the captain i tliink
that can be arranged

  and it was
author of the madness oj quill mchenry the rag and the roaring giant etc

tiny markenson was
called tiny because he was a
mere slip of a fellow weighing
but one hundred and ninety
pounds and was set up like a draft horse
he also had brains and knew how to use
them perhaps that is why the island
trading corporation made him its resident
agent and instructed him to take up head-
quarters on tamana island and look out
for its thousands of square miles of planta-
tions on tamana and a hundred other
islands lying about in the pacific

  while life among the natives of poly-
nesia is not exactly the sort of life a white
man stlects above all things markenson
managed to make out at frequent inter-
vals excitement and adventure intervened
to wipe out monotony and the drudge of
routine work among the islands hence
this story as it opens markenson is
seated in a deck chair on the awning-shaded
quarterdeck of the auxiliary schooner jane
nichols at anchor in tamana harbor idly
gazing forward

  presently doctor craig jarvis an ex-
citable little man came up the cabin hatch
and threw himself wearily into the loam-
mock stretched from the mizzenmast to
the skylight both men were as nearly
naked as civilized men dare to be and still
retain a measure of their modesty but the
heat waves that danced and quivered along
the unshaded portions of the deck seemed
to make a mockery of any attempts to be
comfortable as the doctor sat down in

the hammock markenson tamed on him
with questioning eyes

  whats the trouble he inquired when
the other advanced no information after a
reasonable lapse of time

  jarvis fitted his big shell-rimmed glasses
to the bridge of his nose with a spasmodic
twist of his slender fingers

  whats the trouble with anybody whos
fool enough to parade around in a billion
horse-power sun without a hat he replied
petulantly hes loony thats the trou-
ble

  serious

  i tell you hes crazy snapped back the
other

  markenson muttered a disgruntled
humph and fell to watching the rising
and falling brown backs of the kanakas
as they beat the rust from a length of chain
cable on the forecastle for two solid
hours the two men sat on in silence and the
sun went down behind the rim of the sea
and the kanaka crew knocked off with the
chain then markenson removed his bulky
frame from the chair in which he sat and
moved toward the low rail at the rail he
stopped and looked back

  ill be at the bungalow if you need me
he said shortly

  receiving a curt nod in return he stepped
overside into the boat moored there and
pulled toward the beach a quarter of a mile
away jarvis followed the boat with dreamy
eyes until it reached the beach and its
occupant disembarked and disappeared in


the madness of johnny dyer

i

a grove of date palms that but half con-
cealed a spacious bungalow then he too
rose to his feet and went below to see how
his patient was coming along

  neither of the sane members of the
trinity as the islands knew the three
friends could remember when one of its
number had been laid low by the hand of
the sun yet there was johnny dyer me-
chanical engineer for the corporation lying
in a bunk in the cabin of the jane nichols
talking as no sane man talks as a concrete
proof that calamity plays no favorites

  he rambled on and on through the realms
of fantasy calling up stray bits of life that
began at the end and ended at the begin-
ning which made it all very hard to under-
stand but no matter how far distant his
hallucinations led him he always returned
to the person whom he called edith dar-
ling he muttered over and over seem-
ingly to the girl that it was a blasted
he jarvis who had paused beside the
bunk where the sick man lay tossing heard
and shook his head sadly he picked up a
small silver-framed photo of a girl he found
on dyers pillow and gazed at it long and
intently his gaze at intervals wandering
to dyers flushed face

  then he replaced the photo on the pil-
low and swore softly to himself jarvis
had never been in love but he knew some
things not in medical books it is better
to give a man latitude in which to express
his delirium audibly than to give him medi-
cine to make him sleep and choke him with
phantasmagoria so jarvis betook himself
to his own bunk across the passageway and
left his patient to fight it out

  some time in the very early morning of
the next day before the veil-like mist had
blown out to sea markenson was awakened
from a fitful sleep at the bungalow by a
tumultuous knocking on the veranda

  whats the row he yelled

  is johnny here tiny came a voice
which the agent instantly recognized as
belonging to his doctor friend

  an anxious note in the voice caused him
to hop hastily from his bunk

  what about johnny he inquired ap-
pearing on the veranda where stood jarvis
clad in very little of nothing except his
glasses with their retaining ribbon stream-
ing in a festoon about their wearers neck

  markenson noted that his caller was
white-faced

  well what about johnny he de-
manded a second time when the doctor
seemed to be lost in peering into the dark-
ness where the jane nichols riding light
glimmered like a star on the water 

  hes gone the doctor burst out finally
what a scared look flashed into
markensons eyes when did you miss
him

  about an hour ago

  you searched the schooner carefully
all over-everybody searched replied
the little doctor brokeply

  how about the boats

  all there except the one you came ashore

in i wonder if-

  jarvis stopped abruptly and threw a
frightened glance down toward the surf
breaking softly on the beach not a hundred
feet away

  my god not that gasped the agent
too many sharks for swimming

  thats the only way to explain- began
jarvis when a warning glance stopped him
-blake is standing by for orders-sug-
gests that we circle the island he finished
markenson shook his head hopelessly
a waste of time he said if hes not
aboard and none of the boats are missing
weve got to take it for granted that-the
other you know the white-bellied dev-
ils

  he too threw a glance toward the water
but it was more a glance of hatred than of
fear

  get back to the schooner and have
blake fix rations for twenty men for ten
days you and frankie bring the stuff
ashore ill want both of you to go in one
of the parties bring automatics for you
and me and jarvis he called as the
other man turned away better bring along
a coil of two-inch manila and a grapnel
we may have work of that sort now
hustle

  jarvis hastened back to the beach where
he had left his-boat and pulled off to the
schooner while markenson hastily dressed
and rushed off to the copra sheds to rout
out the natives by dawn jarvis and
frankie blue kanaka boatswain of the
schooner had landed at the bungalow with
the provisions and other gear for an ex-
tended trip after a hasty breakfast two
parties immediately set out for the interior
of the island one party of ten men under
markenson heading northeast the other


adventure

party of twelve men under jarvis heading
northwest both gradually shaping their
course toward big rock which stood near
the center of the island

encountering interminable
toil and hardship in the reeking
jungles the two parties met three
days later under the towering cliffs of big
rock big rock got its name from the
fact that it was indeed no less than a mam-
moth rock circular in shape about two
miles in diameter and circumscribed on all
sides by sheer cliffs from one to two hun-
dred feet high

  no luck confessed jarvis weakly when
the parties met

  and i am positive nothing escaped us
but our luck was no better said marken-
son sitting down in dejection but hes
somewhere on the island of that im sure
he declared trying to keep his thoughts
from dwelling on the monsters darting about
in tamana harbor

  well where demanded the doctor im-
patiently

  i dont know was the forlorn reply
weve got to keep going until we find him
failure in their quest made markenson
peevish for he added-

  are you sure you didnt skip anything
  are you was the pointed retort

  well somebody has been neglectful
the little doctor looked at his companion
narrowly and somewhat resentfully

  well its not me he snapped

  just what proportions this embryo argu-
ment might have reached is a matter for
conjecture but at that moment kind provi-
dence stepped in and saved the day provi-
dence was represented in the person of one
of the natives who suddenly gave a shout
and pointed toward a tongue of rock jut-
ting out from the top of the cliff

  the others looked and saw a naked man
standing on the tongue of rock his hands
on his hips looking down at them with
great concern they could see his features
distinctly it was the missing dyer when
he saw that he was discovered he emitted
a whoop and swung his arm in a wide arc
and the next moment a heavy stone came
crashing down into their midst

  you fool yelled markenson dodging
as the stone caromed against a boulder and
went bounding away narrowly missing one
of the natives in its flight

  stop it supplemented the little doctor
noisily and scooped up a stone and threw
it with all his strength at the man above

  it fell short by a good measure and called
forth a derisive taunting yell from the man
on the cliff who then disappeared beyond
the edge of the cliff and they saw him no
more

  markenson turned to the natives who
were standing nearby in a huddled fright-
ened group and engaged one of them in
conversation he had not gone far in his
questioning when he saw that the man was
cowering under an abject fear he trembled
visibly markenson shot a quick glance
at the other natives and saw tliat the same
was true of them they appeared like dogs
afraid of a masters whip

  the man to whom he was talking stut-
tered and halted in his speech and nothing
intelligible came from his lips finally in
disgust markenson caught the fellow
roughly by the arm and ordered him to
divulge the secret he was apparently at
such great pains to keep despite his
threats commands and entreaties however
the agent was forced to give it up he
swore

  he says theres no way to get up there
he said savagely turning to jarvis

  ask the beggar how johnny got up
there returned the little doctor dryly i
think hes a liar

  so do i and well have to take it out
in thinking

  the next several minutes markenson
spent in scrutinizing the cliff before him
search as he would however his keen eyes
could discover no projection or depression
that might afford foot or liand hold the
face of the cliff was as absolutely smooth
and flat as a wall of glass though he had
lived on tamana island a matter of three
years markenson knew practically nothing
about big rock from what he had been
able to gather from the native it was inac-
cessible no one had ever been on top of
it that is no human dyer was a pioneer

  yet markenson was certain that he had
been lied to had he been more the brute
and less the man he would have whipped
the truth from a natives tongue with a
ropes end being a man he swore and sat
down on a convenient boulder to think it
over his keen eyes roving constantly then
at length he got up again and smiled to
himself
the madness of johnny dyer



  but there is more than one way to kill
a cat doc he said and at once occupied
himself with the rope and grapnel brought
from the schooner

  jarvis carefully adjusted his glasses and
inspected the cliff at length and in detail
then shook his head dubiously

  it cant be done tin he declared
emphatically now if you had a life-
savers gun you might shoot the grapnel up
there but since you havent-well it cant
be done thats all

  again he shook his head

  which proves that your knowledge of
things is limited to anatomy replied the
other scornfully

  the little doctor muttered something
about fools in their wisdom and sat down
with the assistance of frankie blue mark-
enson stretched the rope to its full length
along the ground some three hundred feet
and with his sheath knife cut off about
a hundred feet of the line one end of the
longer line he fastened to the eye on the
shank of the grapnel and one end of the
shorter line he fastened to one of the three
hooks of the grapnel

  he then turned his attention to a single
coconut palm that stood somewhat apart
from a clump of its fellows this tree
seemed to have been produced by a nature
anticipating the needs of the trinty for
it lent itself very readily to the scheme the
big agent had in mind it grew with a
slight inclination away from the cliff its
base which was about seventy-five feet
distant fromthe base of the cliff rooted
at the very edge of a steep incline the
bole was smooth and supple terminating
in a scant clump of foliage about fifty feet
from the ground

  with a satisfied nod markenson ordered
one of the kanakas to shinny up the tree
with the free end of the grapnel line and
fasten it at the top when this had been
done and the man once more stood on the
ground the agent led the two lines with the
grapnel dangling between down the incline
directly away from the -face of the cliff
then markenson paused and looked at the
little doctor and grinned

  a catapult eh said the doctor return-
ing the grin

  history has a habit of repeating itself
admitted the agent proudly

  the idea was to shoot the grapnel to the
top of the cliff with the spring of the palm

all hands now tailed on and began to
haul away frankie blue passing several
turns of the hauling line about a convenient
tree and taking in the slack as the others
hauled it back to him foot by foot and
inch by inch the supple bole of the palm
bent away from the cliff until it formed a
deep bow and the line was as taut as a fidclle-
string

  when all was in readiness markenson
slashed the shorter hauling line close to the
grapnel the palm whipped up with a
rush of wind the long line with the grapnel
at its end trailing after up and up went
the grapnel sailing over the top of the palm
and continuing its swift flight over the edge
of the cliff where it lodged

  as the grapnel disappeared a howl of
terror went up from the natives and before
either of the white men knew what was
transpiring the kanakas were streaming
away down the incline in the direction of
the jungle a short distance away frankie
blue alone hesitated and was lost the
threatening glance he received from mar-
kenson though not sufficient to quell the
uprisings of frankies barbarous nature
was yet sufficient to stay his itching legs

  what the devil ejaculated the little
doctor who stood in wide-eyed wonder until
the last of the bounding kanakas had dis-
appeared in the jungle

  markenson hesitated between a laugh and
an oath the former finally mastering him

  theyre a bit frightened jarvis thats
all said he laughingly the gentlemen
with whom i conversed a while ago in-
formed me that buwani god of things
dwells atop the cliff and weve desecrated
holy ground in short weve stepped in
where angels fear to tread

  rats the missionaries havent been
idle scoffed the other

  to judge from this they have was the
reply a native cant forget his ancestral
gods in a day you know

  jarvis dismissed the thing with a shrug
of his shoulders

  thank the lord theyve left us the
grub he said fervently

by this time the sun was hanging
a blood-red disk in the west and they
decided o let matters rest until the
morning climbing hand over hand up a
swinging rope against the face of a sheer
cliff would in the light of day be a big
	adventure

job after dark it would be as much as a
mans life was worth to attempt it so
frankieblue all ashiver from what he had
seen and still expected to see made a fire
in the lee of a boulder and prepared a sup-
per of canned beef ships bread and coffee

  the meal over the two whites sat puffing
at their pipes and talking then sought their
couches of freshly cut leaves and slept the
sleep of the just not so frankie blue
superstition and fear had put him in a
state of mind where he could hardly bat
his eyes without conjuring up a thousand
devils to torment him at times he felt
an almost uncontrollable impulse to fly
but a glance at the sleeping form of the big
agent nearby quelled the impulse he was
pretty much like a man between the devil
and the deep sea was the kanaka boat-
swain-if he remained the devils would
probably destroy him and if he fled there
was much likelihood of losing his soft snap
as boatswain of the jane nichols

  so debating the matter with himself he
sat with his knees drawn up under his chin
and stared moodily into the fire it was
just before daybreak when markenson
quickly opened his eyes and looked up into
the kanakas terror-stricken face the
agents sudden wakening was caused by
frankie prodding him gently in the ribs

  come quick whispered the kanaka
tensely when he saw that his master was
fully awake

  he started away

  markenson sensing something unusual
grabbed up his automatic and followed the
man at the base of the cliff the kanaka
halted and pointed upward markenson
threw back his head and saw outlined in
clear relief against the graying sky a swing-
ing swaying object that he could not quite
identify that it was not a man he was
certain for the thing possessed none of the
general forms of a man

  but that some one was fooling with the
grapnel line was plainly apparent more-
over it was evident that the object what-
ever it was would soon disappear over the
edge of the cliff in haste markenson threw
up his automatic and emptied its contents
into the rapidly ascending object hardly
had the reports of the shots died away when
a shower of fine granulated substance came
raining down

  if frankie blues brown skin had been
capable of such a thing it would at that

instant have transformed itself to a livid
white

  the sacred meal buwani buwani
he screamed and dashed away yelping at
the top of his lungs

  jarvis awakened by the uproar of the
firing and the kanakas yelling came rush-
ing up

  for heavens sake whats up he
gasped groping wildly for his glasses which
he found at the end of their ribbon and
clapped them to his nose

  markensons answer was a disgusted
grunt going to the fire he shortly re-
turned with a blazing brand and by its
light stooped and scooped together a palm-
ful of the substance that had fallen on his
and the boatswains heads he looked at
it critically a moment then chuckled

  behold the sacred meal of buwani
he chortled and thrust the stuff under the
little doctors nose

  jarvis studied the white grains with a
puzzled expression then sniffed at them

  rats thats rice he asserted with
conviction

  right little man agreed the other

  lets have the tale from the beginning
commanded the doctor tartly

  so they returned to the fire and marken-
son began with the moment he had opened
his eyes and wound up with the fleeing boat-
swain the listener lifting his brows little
by little as the narrative proceeded

  which means that johnny was actually
down here in camp said jarvis at the con-
clusion of the recital

  exactly unless you can offer a more
logical explanation for the fact that one of
our grub packs has disappeared over the
edge of the cliff on the end of the rope

  but as the doctor could not or at least
did not offer that more logical explanation
he suggested that as it was now growing
daylight they get breakfast and make a
start somewhere they had hardly sat
down to a hastily prepared breakfast if
coffee and bread could be called a break-
fast when a deep booming sound assailed
their ears coming on them so abruptly
it was positively disconcerting

  they twisted their heads this way and
that in an effort to fathom the mystery but
could make neither heads nor tails of it
it was not the booming report of a gun they
were quite sure though small cruisers fre-
quently put in at tamana it possessed more
the madness of johnny dyer



the ringing qualities of a bell yet it was
unlike the sound of any bell they had ever
heard the first few notes were intermit-
tent each note complete and distinct in
itself then they blended into a continuous
weird singing noise of great volume in
that desolation of hills and jungle it was
uncanny

  it gives a fellow the creeps whispered
jarvis

  for fully fifteen minutes the sound con-
tinued then died down to a whisper and
finally ceased altogether the two men
finished their breakfast in silence

  well the ropes gone tiny said the
doctor as they rose to their feet and began
to lash their packs what now

  well look for the path replied mar-
kenson last nights episode convinces
me that there is a path to the top of that
rock else how did johnny get down here

  perhaps he came down on the rope
suggested jarvis

  markenson shook his head

  perhaps but i dont think so going
on the supposition that there is a path
well start here and work our way clear
around this blasted rock then if we dont
find anything well hire a balloon and get up
that way

  therewith they threw their packs on their
backs and hiked away toward the west
they had gone but a short distance exam-
ining every inch of ground carefully when
they encountered a tangle of jungle that at
first glance appeared to be well-nigh im-
penetrable but markenson swore by all
heathen gods and his own that nothing short
of death would balk him to which noble
declaration the little doctor nodded a hearty
amen they forged ahead at noon they
halted in a little glade cool and inviting
after the toil of the morning and here they
had dinner

  just how it all happened markenson did
not remember it came on him so suddenly
that he did not have time to think all
he remembered was that after dinner he
walked over to the base of the cliff where
something had attracted his attention and
stepped on an innocent mat of vines trail-
ing along on the ground the vines rushed
up to meet him and yelling he fell into
darkness when he came to he was lying
on his back with jarvis leaning over him
bathing his head which felt immensely dis-
torted and painful

  its all right old man stay where you
are he heard an anxious voice saying as
he opened his eyes and looked into the little
doctors goggle-eyed face

  it requires more than a nasty fall to kill
some men however and despite the medi-
cal mans protests markenson sat up he
put his hand to his head and it came away
stained with blood he looked at jarvis
for an explanation

  you tumbled down a deep deep well
tiny said jarvis interpreting the expres-
sion on the others face aright a very
silly thing to do but you did it nevertheless
and inadvertently you stumbled on the very
tiling we have been looking for-the path
at least thats the way it looks to me
would you care to look at the place

  the agent signified his willingness and
jarvis helped him to his feet and led the
way to the cliff where the mat of vines lay
the doctor pushed back the vines with his
foot to disclose a black rift markenson
leaned over and looked down but the place
was as dark as a velvet pocket and he saw
nothing

  and down there i had to go and drag
you out went on the doctor letting the
vines fly back in place tiny when
youre unconscious youre about as handy
to handle as an elephant he laughed

  how in the world did you manage it
queried the big man in amazement eyeing
the slight figure of the doctor from head to
feet

  goodness knows-i had to replied
jarvis but hold on i forgot to say that
i had the assistance of a perfectly good
flight of stairs

  what

  the doctor nodded yes a flight of
stairs thats why i say weve found the
trail at last

  that settles it burst from markenson
and he would have shouldered his pack and
made an immediate start down into the
well had not the other held him in leash

  no you dont we stay right here until
you are fit to travel protested the doctor
haste makes waste you know he coun-
seled weve got plenty of grub and
oceans of time so we can afford to take it
easy

  but johnny- began the injured man
but was interrupted by a curt gesture of the
little mans hand

  johnnys an ass let him wait


adventure

interposed the doctor explosively if it
wasnt for johnny we wouldnt be breaking
our hearts and backs traipsing around look-
ing for him

  markenson growled at the restraint but
jarvis was obdurate and hinted broadly
that his orders would be obeyed if he had
to enforce them with the butt end of an
automatic over a thick head he spoke
so earnestly that the big agent smiled and
gave in they saw or heard nothing of
dyer during the next day or so they did
hear however sometimes at night and
sometimes during the day the weird boom-
ing sound but they did not connect the
missing dyer with the booming

  at the end of the third day following his
tumble into the well markenson pro-
nounced himself fully recovered and to
prove the assertion he picked the doctor up
bodily and threw him across his big shoul-
ders with ease that was sufficient proof of
his fitness so they agreed to make a start
the next morning

by daylight of the next day
they had finished breakfast ahd
made a torch of dry twigs then
again taking up their packs they started
for the door to hell as markenson ex-
pressed it tying back the vines at the
point where the stairs began markenson
lit the torch and led the way down

  the center of the step was deeply
grooved proving that they had been used
very extensively in their day the sides
of the well were composed of small
smoothly-hewn stones damp and cold to
the touch and thickly studded with niter
which glittered like diamonds in the fitful
light of the torch

  arriving at the bottom of the stairs about
forty steps in all they found themselves
looking into a dark forbidding tunnel the
height of which was barely sufficient to per-
mit the big agent to walk upright into
the tunnel they plunged and at the end of
five minutes they turned an abrupt curve
and saw a faint light ahead hurrying on
they presently stepped out into the light
of day

  the light was rather feeble however
owing to the fact that it filtered in at the
top of a narrow crevasse about two hun-
dred feet long and more than a hundred
feet deep it was for all the world as if
they were standing at the bottom of a tall

chimney of unusual and erratic dimensions
plainly the crevasse was the work of a
terrestrial convulsion and owing to a freak
of that convulsion the crevasse could be
seen only by approaching it through the
tunnel or from the top of the rock

  at first glance it appeared that the way
was blocked but jarvis who had been
looking around suddenly caught his com-
panion excitedly by the arm and pointed
to a narrow fissure extending from top to
bottom at one side of the crevasse at
regular intervals up this fissure thick iron
rods had been embedded in its sides thus
forming a ladder of sorts

  it will be like climbing a jacobs-ladder
to heaven cried jarvis

  its the only way up said markenson
grimly so lets be at it

  jarvis as the lighter man elected to
start first he stepped on the bottom
round of the ladder and began the ascent
testing each round of the ladder carefully
before trusting his weight to it marken-
son soon followed to the man who has
not had his share of perilous feats the
climbing of such a ladder up a narrow crack
in the earth might present drawbacks but
to men who on numerous occasions had
faced death in various guises the feat was
merely one of those prosaic incidents that
go with a days work

  at last the two men stepped from the
crack at the top of the rock and stood work-
ing the cramps from their limbs and looking
about them their eager eyes beheld a
scene of gorgeous beauty they surmised
that at the moment they were standing on
the lip of the crater of an extinct volcaao
the diameter of the crater almost equal to
the diameter of the rock about two miles
in truth big rock itself was no less than
the upstanding colossal throat of the volcano

  from the hp the crater at every point
on its circumference swooped sharply down
to a depth of fifty feet or more then
leveled itself and flowed away a beautiful
flat plain carpeted with a verdant growth
of grass with here and there clumps and
rows of bushes and trees of variegated
colors the whole appeared as a pro-
digious bowl upon the inner surface of
which a gigantic artist had painted a
pastoral scene of surpassing beauty and
as the immensity of the picture impressed
itself upon the two spectators they gasped
with wonder and appreciation
the madness of johnny dyer



  but what surprised them even more and
caused further exclamations to leap from
their lips was the solitary two-story build-
ing that stood in the very center of the bowl
moreover from the building a thin column
of smoke drifted lazily into the still air
buwani cried the man of medicine
johnny echoed markenson

  they both laughed

  now if i were an archeologist i would
say that we have discovered something
valuable went on the agent after an in-
terval once i entertained a party of
tourists here at tamana and among them
was a professor dawes who informed me
that the islands in the pacific were once
component parts of an extensive continent
maintaining a superior civilization

  theres your evidence said jarvis in-
dicating the building with a nod of his head
however lets find johnny we can sift the
evidence afterward

  we havent seen any evidence of his
having a gun said markenson as they pre-
pared to go on but thats no sign he hasnt
one crazy men are not apt to be dis-
criminating so lets be careful

  they made their way to a point on the
lip of the crater several hundred yards far-
ther along where a row of trees extended
down the side of the bowl and across the
plain to within a hundred or so feet of the
building down they plunged using the
trees as concealment and at last stood but
a short distance from the building clearly
now they saw that the structure before
them was of heroic proportions

  it had the general appearance of one of
the community houses of the navaho in-
dians but instead of the adobe brick and
mud of the navaho houses this building
was constructed of the small stones similar
to those they had seen in the well beyond
the cliff they scrutinized the place closely
but saw no sign of human habitation except
the wisp of curling smoke rising from the
roof suddenly a rumbling boom broke
the silence and courageous though the two
men were they instinctively shrank jar-
vis whipped out his automatic

  hold on cried the agent in alarm
sweeping the gun down with a quick motion
of his hand dont get excited and plug
johnny little man

  with a shame-faced grin jams replaced
the gun in its holster the boom ceased
with the single stroke but in its stead as

if to further play upon their taut nerves
there came from the interior of the building
a mocking laugh markenson swore

  come on he said savagely

  therewith gritting their teeth they
marched out from the shelter of the trees
and made for the building as they went
they heard the mocking laugh again then
again and again and at last it ended in a
series of croaking derisive guffaws

  the poor poor devil muttered jarvis
compassionately

  jarvis had heard such sounds before issu-
ing from the lips of madmen and knew of
the great disaster that lay behind them
johnny was doubtless a babbling slobber-
ing idiot

  without mishap they reached the build-
ing and entered by one of the several doors
on that side they stepped inside with
every sense alert every muscle tensed and
ready for instant action should occasion
warrant as men go dyer was not a giant
but life in the open had developed him
beyond the ordinary and he was as tough
as wire nails in a scrimmage he would
no doubt prove himself a wicked if not
altogether triumphant adversary so dis-
cretion was indeed the better part of valor

  by the light reflected into the building
from outside the two men had no difficulty
in finding their way about the room in
which they stood was spacious and bare of
all furnishings unless a rough ladder stand-
ing in one corner which lost itself in a trap-
door affair in the ceiling could be called
furnishings from room to room they
made their cautious way hearing no sound
except their own footsteps and seeing noth-
ing but the naked walls and floors the
place seemed to be utterly deserted

  up stairs said markenson shortly when
they had looked into the last room on the
ground floor

  he led the way to the room where they
had noted the ladder and without hesita-
tion began the ascent jarvis following
closely on his heels at the top the agent
paused and thrust his head cautiously above
the aperture half expecting to feel a club
come smashing down on his skull nothing
of the sort occurred however and they
went on up and stepped into a black void

  if the room in which they found them-
selves contained a window or a door it was
hermetically sealed the only light in the
place came from the blotch which marked


adventure

the trap-door through which they had just
come and that was negligible the dark-
ness closed in about them like something
tangible something that they could feel and
cut with a knife their ears tensed to catch
the faintest sound they stood listening

      abruptly like a flash from a
v ty clear sky the sound came it
 poured over them like a rushing
river tumbling and surging and swirling
about them eddies of deafening sound
crashing and roaring one moment the
next sighing and crying into their ears
like the wailing of a gale on the open sea

  boomi b-o-o-o-ml it came rushing at
them like an invisible clutching hand that
would choke the very lives from their bodies
smothering and suffocating them with its
detonations beings of flesh and blood
have their limitations

  jarvis jerked his ever-ready automatic
from its holster and emptied its contents
into the vast wells of darkness about them
then with a cry flung the weapon from him
and leaped for the ladder when almost
to the bottom of the ladder he lost his foot-
ing and fell sprawling on the floor of the
room below like a fish stranded on the beach

  markenson followed an instant later but
more fortunate than his companion landed
right-side-up and ran blindly scrambling
to his feet the erstwhile dignified physician
followed his big friend into the sunlight
the little doctor was indeed a disreputable
sight

  what little clothing he wore was ripped
and torn and the grub pack on his back
now twisted awry was a wreck which per-
mitted its contents to leak out and mark
the path of flight over his right eye was
a cut from which the blood oozed slug-
gishly nor was markenson much better
off they were both visibly and shock-
ingly scared at a safe distance from the
building they stopped and looked back
jarvis fumbling for his glasses and clamp-
ing them to his nose

  a strange sight met their gaze and one
not conducive to relieve their outraged feel-
ings to any appreciable degree standing
on the roof of the building one foot resting
on the low parapet and leaning indolently
on a huge wooden maul stood the missing
man he was looking down at his two
comrades with an expression of mingled
surprise and mirth but far from being

disrobed as they had seen him on a previous
occasion he was now garbed in the conven-
tional white duck trousers and soft shirt of
the gentleman of the pacific a wide-
brimmed straw hat cocked rakishly over
one eye

  hello there you boobs were you look-
ing for some one he called down after a
long interval of staring

  the little doctor gulped surely such
rational words could not issue from the lips
of a madman a further exceedingly mi-
nute diagnosis of the madmans face con-
vinced the doctor that dyer was perfectly
sane there was none of that wild aimless
staring so noticeable in the eyes of one
mentally unbalanced markenson was the
first of the two to regain control of himself

  what the- he began but got no fur-
ther he choked with wrath and the ques-
tion transformed itself into a violent burst
of swearing

  dyer laughed

  come up and lets talk it over he in-
vited youll find steps on the other side
of this shebang

  there was no alternative so the two men
walked around the building to the other
side and found the steps as directed in a
few moments they stood on the roof dyer
eyed them suspiciously holding himself in
readiness for flight or battle at the first
signs of hostility

  is there anything youd like to know
gentlemen queried the madman after a
time

  his words were the pattern of elaborate
graciousness

  no not a thing we assure you replied
markenson with biting sarcasm but the
sarcasm was lost on dyer who grinned
good-naturedly

  whats the meaning of this foolishness
demanded the little doctor angrily glaring
at dyer as if he would eat him

  ill let buwani tell you part of the
story replied dyer from what ive
seen of this place i imagine buwani used to
have the careful attentions of a priest but
as the priest hasnt been around for a hun-
dred years or so im filling the job tem-
porarily listen to what buwani has to
say

  taking the wooden maul he held in his
hands dyer walked across the roof to an
object which the others had not before
noticed or if they had noticed it had
the madness of johnny dyer



thought it of no consequence the object
was a gallows-like affair from which was
suspended a smooth log of wood about ten
inches in diameter and six or seven feet long
it swung free of the roof and much resem-
bled a man hanging by the neck thus
heightening the illusion of a gallows

   going up to this contrivance dyer swung
the maul and brought it with great force
against the log the result was a deep
resonant boom that literally made the roof
tremble it was the sound markenson and
the doctor had heard the first time beyond
the cliff the apparatus was in fact a
one-note xylophone on a large scale dyer
swung the maul for a second stroke but
jarvis made the intervening distance and
caught his arms

  for gods sake let the thing alone
ive had enough of buwani he cried

   i should think so said the other laugh-
ingly throwing the maul down yet
you must admit it is a wonderful instru-
ment my friend on a still day its music
can be heard ten miles the native monks
in morocco use such a device for frighten-
ing devils though i know of a case where
white men-

   a dangerous glint in two pairs of eyes
warned him that he was treading on dan-
gerous ground

  what else gentlemen he finished
quietly

   markenson seated himself on the parapet
and pulled dyer down beside him

  tell me johnny how did you get
ashore he inquired his eyes fastened on
dyers face

   in a boat

   no lies there were no boats missing
how did you get ashore repeated the
agent ominously

   well then one of the natives brought
me ashore in his canoe replied dyer

  thereupon markenson looked daggers at
the doctor

   i said somebody had been neglectful
he growled

   and wasnt it up to you to look after
the shore boats retorted janas acidly

   markenson snorted and ignored the slur

   if you came ashore in a natives canoe
why werent we told of it he asked turn-
ing again to dyer

   thats a fair question and deserves a
fair answer replied the other after a mo-
ments study you see tiny i bribed

one of the niggers to bring me ashore
  well

  when you get back to the bungalow
take an inventory of your stock of liquor
you will find a bottle of scotch missing i
purloined it i promised my abductor an-
other if he would keep his mouth shut
insult to injur with my own whisky
too moaned markenson

  but broke in the excitable little man
of medicine at this point whats the idea
for all this why did you sneak away
why have you put us to all this trouble
why did-oh the devil-why everything
speak

  then johnny dyer sighed a happy sigh
and from his shirt-pocket took a sack of
tobacco and papers he painstakingly
rolled a cigaret and lit it then to further
aggravate his companions he leisurely puffed
at the cigaret and sent delectable clouds of
smoke from his nostrils

listen my dear friends he
began impressively i have done
what i have done to get square with
you perhaps your weak brains will per-
mit you to recall that you two miserable
sinners played a joke on me not so very
long ago to an auckland newspaper you
sent an article wherein was set forth that
one johnny dyer which was myself was
married to one of the native queens down
this way securing a copy of the paper
in which your article appeared you marked
the article and forwarded the paper to a
certain lady in the states unfortunately
she believed every last word of that in-
famous lie

   never let me see your blackguard face
again she told me in a letter which she
wrote immediately upon receipt of your
paper and by numerous blotches appear-
ing on that letter i was sure it cost her a
great deal to write it however after much
trouble chiefly caused by securing affi-
davits from prominent people in these
parts i was again admitted to the ladys
affections

  oh lord have mercy groaned jarvis
yes the lord have mercy said dyer
bruskly i have none

  it was only a joke johnny cut in
markenson lamely trying to defend a posi-
tion which he knew full well was inde-
fensible

  dyer laughed scornfully
o

adventure

  and a fine joke it was was his cynical
rejoinder if you have ever been in love
youll realize what your silly joke cost me
i lived in hell for several weeks believe me
i took a solemn oath to get even with you
fellows and here you are not so long ago
i chanced to hear our doctor friend here
telling you about one of your niggers who
had been bowled over by the sun that
was my clue if the sun would knock out
a nigger what would it do to a white man
knock him silly eh doc at any rate
it knocked me silly at least thats the sup-
position

  remember how i went about without
my hat it was a risky thing to do i
admit but i had to make the evidence
plain i read in one of your medical books
jarvis how a man acted when he got a
touch of the sun so i did some practising
to get the hang of it yet my friends it
is you who were loony not i while you
were groaning and moaning over my con-
dition i was laughing at you

  detestable wretch rasped jarvis

  detestable wretches you mean grimly
corrected dyer as a climax to my sup-
posed insanity he went on i bribed a
nigger to paddle me ashore while you slept
i had a few things stowed away at the copra
sheds so i got them and came up here i
took it for granted that my good freinds
would not let me perish and that -youd
come seeking me oh men i had great
faith in ye

  naturally you knew all about the path
up here and said nothing about it said
markenson ironically

  certainly responded the other quickly
about two weeks ago i came up this way
hunting and by the merest chance stumbled
on that hole down by the cliff since i
took your rope i suppose you came the
same way i fully intended to tell you
about my find but before i got back the
big idea came to me it struck me that
i could use my secret to get square with
you fellows

  one thing following another i fixed
things with the native and went mad then
i vamoosed and let you dig in and enjoy
yourselves to judge by personal appear-
ances i wouldnt say youve been to a
picnic trouble trouble toil and trouble
eh besides what would your many
friends think of this story

  he paused and looked at them eloquently

  for a time after dyer ceased speaking
there was an unbroken silence then mar-
kenson urged on by certain signs of appro-
bation from the doctor said

   johnny your point is well taken but
remember what the book says in regard to
such things forgive them for they know
not what they do now in order to make
amends and set you right in the estimation

of this-ah-er-

   miss edith supplied the little doctor
with a sly glance at dyer

  a-hum-this miss edith yes con-
tinued the agent we will doc and i
write her an explanatory letter fully
exonerating you from all sin is that
enough

  the eyes markenson turned on dyer
were so filled with repentance and con-
trition dyer was himself somewhat ashamed
of his revenge he grabbed the agents
hand and gave it a liberal squeeze doing
the same for jarvis

   i forgive you both he said

   thanks johnny came the echo

   but it is indeed an ill wind that blows
no good spoke dyer at length looking
out across the plain ive made an im-
mense discovery in this old crater a dis-
covery that will have a far-reaching effect
on international affairs this crater is one
huge solid deposit of sodium nitrate and
sulfur my friends of course you know
without being told that the former is a base
for a number of high explosives and the
latter is used extensively in the manufac-
ture of common powder what do you
think of that

   what has that got to do with the cor-
poration inquired markenson his keen
eyes on dyers face in search for a hidden
meaning the corporation has no rights
here except on the plantations

   did i say anything about the corpora-
tion demanded the other i am think-
ing of something far greater than the cor-
poration

   well what said jarvis striving vainly
for light

   i am thinking of the united states gov-
ernment almost shouted dyer the
united states owns every grain of these
immense deposits and when you consider
that the greater part of the worlds supply
of sodium nitrate comes from chili a
country none too friendly to our interests
you will realize what it means to uncle
a lucky cross



sam and the government doesnt know
that these deposits are here

  funny i admit but its a fact i am
the discoverer of these deposits gentlemen
the records on file merely state that
tamana is an island of volcanic origin and
of little value oh lord of little value
bully boy shouted the little doctor as

the full import of the thing came home to
him

  well done thou good and fraudulent
lunatic yelled markenson

  but the madman only grabbed the maul
and beat on buwani until that abused god
sang the star-spangled banner in one
note

a lucky cross

        by bert van

george frenchy bur-

goyne was what we called in
montana a cayuse-frenchman
if there is such a hyphenated
nationality he punched cows for a liv-
ing sang songs because his nature de-
manded it and grinned when somebody
wanted to fight not that he wanted to
fight but as he said

  when somebody she goes on de prod
dere mus be somebody to accommodate
george carried an old bone-handled colt
and gained the respect of every one when
he emptied the old gun in a saloon one eve-
ning and obliterated the features of a lith-
ographed damsel who knelt at a spring and
advertised the wonders of a certain mineral
water the head would measure about
three inches and george was fifty feet away

  kid haley hated george for no
known reason except that george laughed
all the time while the kid was of a sullen
morose disposition prone to soak his sys-
tem in absinthe and whisky and their na-
tures clashed haley was a bartender and
was painfully cross-eyed he had made
threats that some day he would wipe the

grin off that - frenchman but when

george heard about it he laughed and shook
his head

  non she ees dere to steek dat keed
is too cross in de eye

  came the night of a dance and the little

cow-town was in its glory haley was
tending bar at the eureka saloon and get-
ting more sullen at every drink while
george danced and sang and leaned
against the bar and drank whisky like it was
water

  i had left the saloon and started for the
dance-hall when i heard the sputter of pis-
tol shots in the saloon a few seconds later
i heard the door slam and somebody came
running down the street it was the
frenchman and he was choking with
laughter when he caught up with me

  a few pistol shots more or less was noth-
ing unusual especially on the night of a big
dance but i knew there must have been
something out of the ordinary connected
with that fusillade i waited until his joy
subsided and then inquired as to the cause
for his hilarity

  haw haw haw he roared shes
one good joke

  keed haley shoot tree four times at me
hard he could blow haw haw haw
laughable i agreed did you kill
him george

   non whats de use she ees worse
den death you sabe de beeg mirror what
cuts off de fron door bien de keed
ees so cross in de eye dat he mak meestake
which ees me an he shoot-out from de
mirror now he have de bad luck seven
year for sure-ver good eh

o
author of the white moths of vizgayon danger trail etc

     u stand by the gang kid
         warned buck hcndricks with
         portentously scowling brow

   jl if you do the gangll stand by

you see if you dont-

  a significant snap of the fingers elo-
quent in its promise of an early demise
completed the sentence

  but in truth the commandment was an
easy one for jimmy to accept for all his
young life he had been standing by any one
whom he had once called a friend child
of the streets as he was clouds of glory
hadnt yet ceased to trail about his boy-
hood and since other forms of righteous-
ness were rather in eclipse in his world
jimmy had been compelled to build all his
creed upon the one article of faith called
personal loyalty

  he answered hendricks suitably enough
in words but more convincing was his
expansive smile wide beaming trustful
and altogether trustworthy a smile which
hendricks immediately recognized as an
asset in his business in which the appear-
ance of friendship availed much

  when hendricks asked him what he had
done for a living jimmy replied naively-
folks but that answer was actuated
mainly by a desire to please true a
certain cleverness at craps was jimmys
but on occasions he had worked too
peddled extras carried messages once for
a whole week held a regular job in a grocery
store all in all his had been a rather
harmless existence but it can not be
denied that knowing no home he had

  become quite adept in the tricks ruses and
  camouflage of the pavements and in the
  various arts of getting without giving by
  which according to his teaching men ac-
  quired merit

    in a month hell be as fly as they make
  em his patron assured hendricks who
  was standing at the time in the middle of
  his shabby office back of the bar

    hendricks shot his cold passionless eyes
  into the boys shrewd ones carefully scruti-
  nized the young-old freckled wise face
  and decided it might be true so jimmy
  who looked fourteen and might have been
  eleven was taken into the cobweb which
  was to the world of legitimate trade as the
  jackal to the useful beast of burden and
  forthwith began his real business career

    during the next- six months he learned
  many things well not the least of which
  was the principle that anything that is easy
  and profitable is right provided it is suf-
  ficiently safe as a lookout he acquired an
  uncanny intuitive ability to recognize any
  one connected with the police as a runner
  he became acquainted with most of the
  habitues of the fascinating shadowy dis-
  trict north of portsmouth square and
  learned to carry cryptic unintelligible
  messages without altering a syllable also
  he made wide observation of the various
  methods of turning drunkenness to good
  account and he came to look without any
  particular repugnance upon hendricks
  specialty which was that of the knock-
  out-not however by fistic means

    one night when fog lay upon the city

square



like a cloak dulling business in the dance-
halls-already interfered with past all
reason by some new freak ideas of the po-
lice-hendricks drew jimmy through the
side door of the cobweb which opened off
the office on hendricks full rather
handsome broken-nosed face was an avid
eager light the look of a hunting animal
that stalks its prey

  you got me he asked holding jimmy
for a moment in the doorway

  i gotcha all right the chinos
jimmy flashed the ghost of his old smile on
hendricks

  sure dont make no bull now that
dudes got a roll like an elephants trunk
and the dicks are all down commercial
street for a wonder if you aint back in
twenty minutes youll wish you were

  he slipped jimmy a dollar

  now hustle

  jimmy wasted no time in starting
hendricks watched him disappear down
the blurred street then turned and drew
the door shut behind him the sound of
blaring near-music and of shuffling feet had
been coming out of the dance-hall but the
closed door shut this off and shut the light
off too leaving only the blank unpainted
board wall with the mist swirling against
it and dripping down

  full of curious chances as was jimmys
world it would nevertheless have suiprised
him a little had he known that the moment
hendricks was gone a figure detached itself
from that wall it was the figure of a man
a very thin man with flapping black clot hes
and a japer-white face of nervously jerk-
ing shoulders and twitching fingers-such
a man ih short as jimmy might easily be-
come he hurried after jimmy and the
flaring street light at the corner showed
his mean predatory features crossed with a
look of desperate urgency

  jimmy his thoughts boyishly vagrant
but concerned principally with the dollar
or so of easy money that might come to
him from his errand turned down kearny
street for two blocks here where the
sidewalk was full of men was a good chance
for his pursuer to close up on him and he
improved it when the two turned off
into a side street they were perhaps fifty
yards apart

  this section overlooks the down-town
district which was flooded with a garish
yellow light at one end of which the ferry

building pointed upward like a dully illu-
minated monstrous needle but where
jimmy walked there were few open shops
and the lights from thesef discouraged-
looking chinese restaurants and pawn-shops
hardly thrust back the curtain of night
the fog was so thick that what few loiter-
ers there were seemed to be waiting in
ambush the hurrying figures loomed up
suddenly and then were gone like specters
and everything seemed shrouded in the
folds of mist

  but there was nothing about this that
conveyed a warning to jimmy and pres-
ently he passed into an even more desolate
street where the ramshackle buildings
seemed to have jostled each other to the
point of tumbling and there were no other
passers-by at all here the white-faced
man lengthened ins stride putting his feet
down at the same instant as did jimmy
and so creeping upon him unheard and
in the middle of a block with a swift noise-
less rush he pounced upon the boy gripped
his throat with one hand and dragged him
sideways into an alley and down upon the
ground

 sudden as was the attack jimmy
f could have cried out but he didnt
ejthat was another lesson he had
earned at the cobweb noise might
bring regular assistance but it would be
more apt to bring the police and in the
forces of the law there is no redress for the
lawless so he fought like a trapped rat
squirming wriggling scratching

  wheres that money turn over that
money came in a hiss

  you-traitor

  the demand told jimmy it was one of
his own world that had attacked him un-
speakable treachery and what little fear
he had felt was drowned in a rush of rage

  somehow jimmy managed to twist his
head until he got his assailants arm be-
tween his teeth and he crunched down
savagely but the other wrenched his-arm
free and ground jimmys face against the
pavement

  you-yer worsen a snitch it was
the uttermost insult

  he felt the mans hand pressing into his
trousers pocket and was suddenly worried
by the thought that hendricks plans
would be delayed probably nullified alto-
gether because of his own lack of alertness


adventure

  you petty larceny thief he cried

  and then rescue came just as jimmy
felt the dollar fished from his pockets it
came sauntering along the street in the
shape of a man who loomed enormous in
the gloom deftly he reached down
plucked up the two combatants bodily
and pulled them apart he did it with
gentleness albeit with absolutely irresistible
strength and there was a certain large
good humor in his first words that held
jimmy over his instinctive impulse to try
to wrench away

  waal waal whats the rumpus dirty
place to be sploshin around in why
what the devil his tone quickly changing
to anger i thought you was both kids

what dye mean ye big-

  one glance had sufficed jimmy to classify
the man the high boots corduroy trous-
ers and flannel shirt were unmistakable
signs and jimmy knew that had it been
lighter the broad roughly hewn face of
his rescuer would have shown brick-red
from sun exposure he was one of the
large-hearted good-natured race whom
jimmy had nevertheless learned to despise
and because he was jimmy voiced his ap-
peal confidently

  oh mister hes got-

  but the gutter-man was of no mind to
wait for judgment at the beginning of
the boys wail he had writhed sideways and
twisted under the restraining arm it was
a clever dodge devised primarily for the
confusion of policemen and their ilk and
it wasnt to lie expected the hand of the
rustic would prevail against it like a
shot the fellow was off down the black
alley leaving his erstwhile captor staring
stupidly after him

  but jimmy was not content to stare
he flung after the fleeing man an entirely
unexpurgated string of epithets until the
countryman put a protesting hand on his
shoulder

  tut tut thems strong words off a
young belly mson not that i aint in
entire agreement for a grown-up man
thatll beat up a kid is anything you want
to say what the dickens was the mat-
ter anyway

  whereupon jimmy realizing there were
still possibilities in the situation choked
back his anger and recalled himself to the
practical side of life

  he stole my dollar he cried as plain-

tively as he knew how i gotter have
that dollar its for medicine for my
sick-

  pshaw now thats too bad but a
dollar aint so much except when you aint
got another i reckon-there yare

  jimmy grinned in the darkness hicks
certainly are easy he reflected

  tank yer he said aloud i gotter
pay yer back some time he added as the
proper sort of afterthought

  the man laughed he had a deep real
laugh such as the gray and sordid lives of
jimmys companions didnt seem to
produce

  youd have one fine time findin me
kid whats your name

  jimmy

  mines jenkins

  gravely he extended his hand and as
jimmy took it he perceived that the man
was not wholly free from drink

  ill tell you jimmy i dont blong here
no moren a rabbit i five up nevada
city way and then some way back where
the world all stands up on edge and there
aint nothing but rocks and trees and wild
things and-and god a miner i am
placer-miner one-man claim but it pays
and say kid im so plumb lonesome for
them old hills that-

  he waved his hand generally in the
direction from which jimmy had come

  seems like in town i got to have some
company but im goin back in the
mornin so - dye really want to square
this up

  sure said jimmy since promises cost
nothing

  well you just pass it along then
when you see a fellow that aint got no
chance like you hadnt you just pass along
any little help you can scrape up and the
dollar too if he needs it thatll make it
square far as im concerned will you do
it

  i-i-sure jimmy was conscious
of feeling unpleasantly and uncharacteris-
tically solemn

  thats all right then jimmy was
edging away so long

  so long said jimmy and so long
hick he flung over his shoulder as he
retreated

  probably it was perversity that made
him add that last derisive word but some-
thing else than perversity caused him to
square



voice it so the miner could by no means
have heard it

  then jimmy was running up the street
worried a little by the delay but with cer-
tain other strange emotions crowding his
heart too promises made in such a case
certainly meant nothing but as certainly
there was something about this one that
clung to his mind maybe it was the
miners use of the word square since
squareness was jimmys one rule of life
to be square to the gang-but my how
the miner had twisted the meaning of the
word

  when you see a man that aint got no

chance-

  what chance would the dude have-the
dude with the plethoric bankroll in the
annexation of which jimmies present
errand was to end the same chance that
any of his predecessors had had to be
drugged dragged out robbed and left to
the mercy of the black alley jimmy
thought with a rather twisted smile how
quickly he could redeem his promise if he
chose

presently jimmy still with his
thoughts unpleasantly confused
turned into pacific street hurried
up that thoroughfare for a block and a half
and then into a narrow passageway up
a certain rickety flight of steps he climbed
to the second story rapped softly on a door
and muttered a password the door
opened he entered and came out a minute
later with a tiny bottle in his hand

  as he started down the steps he dropped
that bottle as he had been taught over
the balustrade upon a little space of soft
mud that received it without a sound he
had done this many times before super-
caution it had seemed but this time the
trick served him well for as he reached
the ground a heavy hand came out from
behind the stairs and gripped him

  where is it

  wheres what le me loose

  the dope come quick with it

  a detective had him a plain-clothes
dick arch-enemy and by jimmys creed
despised of all true men a muscular
middle-aged heavy-set man with a black
mustache and a harsh and threatening
voice

  i aint got no dope le me go

  well see about that

  the search was intimate and thorough
but it revealed nothing but a broken-
bladed pocket-knife and a dog-eared story-
book

  what did you want with that chink
  hendricks sent me up to pay him some

money selp me

  the old story said the detective a
lie of course but we cant raid every chino
joint in town and then theres the drug-
stores see here jimmy his voice
changed to the cajoling note youd
better cough up

  what yer talkin about

  you know all right youre clean this
time but weve got your number and
the chiefs passed the word the games got
to be stopped youre runnin with a
smooth gang but well get em and you
with em and youre too fine a lad to go to
quod theres fifty dollars cash in it for
tellin us what you know and a good job

besides and ill-

  jimmys little frame stiffened and anger
and contempt came into his voice

  you go chase yerself bet yer was a

-stool yerself before-

  aw i was eh

  cruelty flourishes where men prey upon
men and in turn are preyed upon the
detectives back-hand blow caught jimmy
and knocked him sprawling and jimmy
scrambling to his feet knew he was lucky
to have escaped so easily

  get along with you rasped the de-
tective ill see you with nippers on and
in the reform school

  jimmy went reeling from the effect of
the blow and quivering all over he went
as far as the end of the alley there he
hid and when he was sure the coast was
clear came back and retrieved the bottle
then he ran as fast as he could back to the
cobweb

  he went through the side door into the
office signaled the bartender and hen-
dricks came out

  a devil of a fly boy you are what
kept you but give me the peter

  his harshness didnt hurt jimmy how-
ever for later he could explain the delay
and win praise and though jimmys
head still throbbed he rather liked to feel
the throbbing it reminded him that
under pressure of fear and a bribe enor-
mous he had kept faith but the scene he
knew was to follow inside the dance-hall


adventure

drew him with an unpleasant fascination
presently he followed hendricks and crept
cautiously-for there was a silly police
prohibition against his presence in the bar-
room-to the end of the bar

  try as he would jimmy had not yet
learned to like this part of the game he
was not gifted in self-analysis and the
stirring of his not yet dead moral sense
went unrecognized but there was some-
thing about it from which he shrank it
was easy money it was fairly safe it was
the practise of the gang and he had accus-
tomed himself to join in their merriment
over it but-well jimmys was as yet a
boys inquiring mind and he sometimes
wondered with all the talk of squareness
to whom the gang was really square

  things in the cobweb were about as
usual men and women dancing men and
women drinking determined light-hearted-
ness everywhere and all sadness prohibited
except perhaps in the make-believe human
heart and jimmy with just the slightest
cloud upon his own spirit peered around
among the tables until he caught sight of
hendricks

  hendricks had already taken his seat
and was beckoning a waiter affability per-
sonified there were three other men at
his table two of them jimmy knew as
hendricks usual confederates in affairs like
this red sam and mccarthy but the
intended victim sat on the other side of
hendricks and jimmy could see only liis
forearms lying loosely on the table

  but at sight of those forearms jimmy
started clearly the program had changed
in his absence for they were not the fore-
arms of a dude they were heavy power-
ful and roughly garmented-and then
jimmy gasped for hendricks had moved
in his chair and the face of his prey was
revealed

  the waiter was coming with the drinks
on hendricks face was a smiling mask he
was talking smoothly jocularly entertain-
ingly as he knew so well how to talk and
-no there could be no mistake-the man
who listened to hendricks with a broad
smile of good-fellowship on his sunburned
face was jenkins the stalwart miner

  jenkins the man who had rescued
jimmy and befriended him without need
the man whose hearty voice and wholesome
words still rang in jimmys ears and stirred
his heart jenkins who had made possible

the success of jimmys errand and by that
act made possible his own undoing

  and jimmy jimmys face whitened
tautened his eyes widened his lips parted
as though for a warning cry and then a
dark angel whispered in his ear and he
grinned

  a joke it was the finest joke the cobweb
had ever known the jest of a man being
hoisted by his own petard being poisoned
by the draft which his own money had
bought such a fine humorous sense had
jimmys gang given him-and to an under-
standing heart the smile on jimmys face
would have been sadder than any tears

  a comic twist to the little drama of the
night-but still grinning jimmy found
himself coming forward between the tables
and as to the force that impelled him to do
this he could not have given a guess
what was it the miner had said

  when you see a man that aint got no
chance-

tip the waiter placed the foaming
ijjlj glasses he placed them with care-
-ful carelessness the miners glass
well to his right almost before hendricks
he placed them so that hendricks had
only to lean forward and the miners glass
would be hidden from the man who was to
drink it and then   

  jimmy remembered that in the dark
alley he had given the miner his hand but
the gang were jimmys pals the grin had
quite faded from jimmys lips by now

  a man that aint got no chance

  drugged dragged out robbed and left
lying like a corpse all in the name of friend-
ship in pretense of caring for one suddenly
overcome by drink-that was the chance
that would be given the miner then in
the morning the terrible awakening
money gone brain muddled the horrible
reaction of drug and drink upon him
memory of this present scene like an inco-
herent nightmare-what chance would he
have even then for redress against men who
could buy alibis with their cigars

  jimmy saw a tense alert look flash into
the eyes and across the smiling faces of
mccarthy and red sam he saw hen-
dricks bend over to the miners ear in a
confidential whisper and raise his right
hand swiftly in the palm of that hand
lay the tiny vial of deadly chloral hydrate
at that all the good that still lived in the
square



boy roused itself in one last passionate
appeal-the appeal of a terrible memory

  to be dragged out robbed and left to
lie like a corpse jimmy remembered one
victim of this most humorous game that
had lain like a corpse indeed he remem-
bered the shuddering fear of the gang at the
sight of the black headlines next morning
and then he did that which seemed to him
in the doing to be unreal and fantastic as
a dream

  past two crowded tables he leaped and
just as hendricks hand poised itself above
the miners glass jimmy caromed with all
the force of his young body against hen-
dricks elbow and he saw the thin color-
less liquid spill itself not into the miners
glass but upon the table

  with the sickening knowledge that his
world was wrecked jimmy saw the miner
perceiving in a glance what had been about
to happen to him spring to his feet

  damnation cried hendricks and then
the miner struck him in the mouth

  from all sides men came running for the
most part friends of hendricks chairs
and tables crashed over in a general pande-
monium mccarthy swung at the miner
missed him but red sam gripped him
about the waist the miner seized an
empty beer-glass

  deyll kill you hick cried jimmy
deyll kill you

  the out-of-doors man swiftly aware of
his peril shattered the rim of his beer-glass
with one blow on the edge of the over-
turned table the resultant ragged pro-
jecting edges made it a terrible weapon
he raised it against red sams face and
the man released him and leaped back

  the miner whirled and sprang toward
the door jimmy who had hovered on the
outskirts of the group started after him
hendricks tried to reach jimmy with his
fist but the blow fell short half-way to
the door the miner checked himself and
seizing jimmy pushed him ahead of him
into the street

  he flung the swinging-doors back with
such terrible force that the foremost of his
pursuers were knocked off their feet but
there was no need of that once in the
street they were safe enough provided

they kept out of the shadows they were
safe the miner with one arm flung about
jimmys shoulder started down the middle
of the street

  but what was this jimmys shoulder
was quivering under his touch the boy
was sobbing

   its all right kid all right jimmy the
miner said reassuringly

  but to jimmy it was not all right it
was indeed all wrong for to him who
had periled his life to save the man who
had succored him had come the unutterable
loneliness that only an unprotected boy
can feel and not unfounded fear of the
vengeance of the gang that had been his
and worst of all remorse and he an-
swered with something like a curse

  puzzled the miner questioned him
whats the matter everythings all
right and that was the gamest tiling the

squarest tiling-

  square cried jimmy thinking angrily
that for this strangers sake he had crossed
his only friends and trampled his one creed

into the mire square the-it was

  but an hour later jimmy was seated on
a bench in portsmouth square with a man
who was no longer a stranger they had
talked of many tilings-the miner had got
a pretty clear idea of jimmys life and the
shadows through which his soul had wan-
dered-but principally they had talked of
the crooked trail of the man who would be
square to those who are square to no one
else and the end of their talk was this
listen jimmy said the miner may-
be you saved my life tonight and maybe
not but anyway it aint any reward im
offerin you its darn lonesome up there
in the hills and i sure would like you to
say yes you better come with me out
where the birds sing and the trees grow
and there aint nothing in earth or heaven
you need to be square to-except just the
whole world

  jimmy in whose mind a vision of a new
life had already begun to unfold could
only reply faintly-

  you-yer kiddin me

  am i said the miner well see
and so jimmy waif of the streets came
out into the world of larger loyalty

sxorv part three
rqj thomas addison

      author of the boss of powdermlle g- defective etc

 the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

pate pulls the strings of human destinies and
a the puppets at the ends of them move in igno-
rance of the force they are elected to serve

  such a victim was james perry jr of norfolk
virginia convalescing from pneumonia he sailed
south and landed at cortina the seat of govern-
ment of zanhoria central america the early part of
april

  by a darkened bedroom window in her home in
the calle dolores winifred brewer stood look-
ing out across the public park it was eleven
oclock the hour of retiring a mans white-flan-
nelcd figure loomed in the rays of a street lamp
as he passed a poinsettia thicket a hand shot out
the man fell hands dragged the body swiftly
into the bushes

  screaming the girl ran downstairs and out into
the street she did not stop for her father who
alarmed at her outcry had appeared in the hall
below in the street winifred ran into enrique
segovia together they searched the park and
found jimmy perry prone under some bushes
perrys head was bleeding from the blow he had
been robbed

  in walter brewers home jimmys wound was
treated he introduced himself to his host and
rescuers leaving the house enrique asked
jimmy if the latter remembered reading of a wil-
liam bowman a richmond real-estate dealer who
had absconded recently with a quarter of a
million dollars jimmy did

  apprehended by the police juan lopez jimmys

assailant disclosed information that led officials
to believe the germans were trying to cause trouble
between zanhoria and the united states jimmy
and enrique planned with the aid of officials to
checkmate the conspiracy

  intent on calling on miss brewer jimmy was told
she and her father had deserted the house in the
calle dolores

at the banco nacional jimmy and enrique
conversed with sefior morales the bank presi-
dent and were introduced to miss mary taylor a
traveler and author miss taylor was the guest
of senor and dona morales having just arrived
from guatemala

  mopping the perspiration from his face senor
morales flipped from his pocket a card bearing the
letters d-viii-k jimmy picked it up and
returned it to the banker

  from the bank jimmy went to the american
legation to call on the hon john henry lane
united states minister to zanhoria

  closeted with the minister jimmy asked him to
send in the official code to washington a letter to his
father mr lane granted the request jimmy ex-
plained what he had learned about the german
conspiracy

  in the street again jimmy saw winifred brewer
drive by in an automobile and stop at a pharmacy
he hastened to her and petitioned her and her
fathers assistance to foil the german plot she
pledged herself to the cause


for the flag	

  the brewers new home she told jimmy was at the
rafael fernandez hacienda on the santa maria road

  shortly after president wilson made his speech
prior to the united states declaration of war on
germany jimmy enrique don luis valera secre-
tary of state and don emilio ortega slate super-
intendent of police questioned lopez about what
he knew of the conspiracy

  lopez told of secret meetings of five mysterious
men at senor morales home from his descrip-
tion one of the conspirators was recognized as herr
adolph kaufman the german minister at this
juncture jimmy told of the card bearing the letters
d-viii-k

  ah said enrique it is simple d stands
for domingo sunday thus domingo-the
eighth-kaufman kaufman writes to morales
from arraca and sets a date for their meeting
arraca was a german lumber camp on the rio
negro river

  zanhorias sympathies senor valera explained
were with the united states and the german
scheme was to overthrow president hurango of the
republic and place a german sympathizer at the
head of the government by this means kaufman
hoped to foment revolutions in central america
and thus divert a part of the united states forces
from her allies abroad

  the proposal to kidnap kaufman was then made
by jimmy he called on brewer to obtain the use
of the hacienda as a prison for the german minister
brewer consented while on the way to the haci-
enda jimmy met mary taylor who broached him
for a ride in his automobile he declined gracefully

  driving away from the brewer place jimmy
passed miss taylor out riding in senor morales
car she nodded to the american

  i lied to her and she caught me wailed jimmy
as he sped toward cortina

ceated at a table in the dining-room of the
europa cortinas hotel were billy smith and
jimmy an automobile bearing miss taylor and
segovia stopped at the entrance

  ha i know that girl exclaimed billy point-
ing at miss taylor i ran across her at the gatun
lodes sunday

  you must be wrong replied jimmy the news-
paper la cronica says she just arrived here from
guatemala

chapter xvii

kidnaped

closed car awaited them
the door opened as they ap-
proached

step in jimmy said a
voice from within

 it was ortegas

 the two entered and the machine glided
 away where they were going neither
 knew nor asked

what is this about enrique don emi-
lio inquired jimmy anxiously

  later in the afternoon kaufman and several
reservist officers of the german army were quar-
tered at the club-house at arraca kaufman was
talking he said

  senor morales has been ordered to call his
committee sunday night for a final consultation
after that we shall hear from general peralta and
then strike on the night of the designated day
captain karsch will seize the cable station at
puerto mono and cover peraltas landing with
machine guns we shall take cortina by surprise
under cover of darkness our u-boat will attend
to the zanliorian navy

  that evening kaufman returned to cortina to
meet miss pricz after he left arraca the following
telegram was sent to cortina

look for package on arraca train tonight

  the next day mrs rebecca isaacs of new york
who said she was searching for a lost uncle visited
the german legation

  then came to the europa segovia with news
that a state paper had been stolen from luis
valeras office he and jimmy hastened to the
office there evidence was adduced proving that
segovia and miss taylor had been the only two
persons in the room before the paper had been
missed

  suspicion was fastened on miss taylor which
segovia resented while at the conference senor
ortega received the arraca message

  an unsigned message also was received by sefior
ortega the following day it stated that there
was a secret wireless plant at the german legation
and one at arraca also

  while standing in front of a renting-agency in
the calle grande mrs isaacs saw miss taylor
drive by in an automobile she signaled the driver
to stop and then advanced to the running-
board of the car she and miss taylor talked for
several minutes

  after a call from jimmy at the american legation
lane announced that billy had resigned

  jimmy and billy were at the hotel when a messen-
ger arrived with the news that enrique had been
injured in an encounter and desired to see jimmy

  well go declared jimmy come on billy
and the two slipped into the street where a car
awaited them

  he was not quite certain that he had in-
terpreted the summons aright the su-
perintendent laughed reassuringly

  not a word of truth in it jixnmy an
excuse to get you out enrique is by this
time on the roof of the valdera warehouse
in the rear of the german legation the
party-wall extends four feet above the roof
an excellent screen for him he held out
his hand to billy good evening mr
smith how are you sir

  he retained the boys hand a shade
longer than the occasion seemed to require
billy sensed the reason

  if its not just steady sir its not


adventure

nerves its excitement he said apolo-
getically im a little tuned up thats all
ortega released his hand smiling to
himself

  youll do he remarked he went on
very seriously now i want to say briefly
that this enterprise you are engaging in is
attended with a danger i wont attempt to
minimize if you fail kaufman will in-
voke all the power of his government to
have you punished unless he takes the law
in his own hands and shoots you down in
your tracks he is a resolute violent man
and he would kill you i believe without the
slightest hesitation

  i wouldnt blame him said jimmy
coolly i would do it if any one tried to
get away with me

  if he isnt good well spank him put
in billy gleefully

  don emilio mightily pleased noted that
the pair was not even considering the pos-
sibility of failure

  we are stopping where are we
queried jimmy

  a patrol-box i am going to telephone
just a moment boys

  ortega stepped out jimmy took a look
around from the door but he could not
determine in what part of the city they were
the superintendent came back he gave a
direction to the driver and the machine
darted off soon it was going at express
speed there was none to forbid for the
body of the law sat inside and ruled
ortega spoke

  herr kaufmans limousine has left its
garage in the calle rosario with lights out
three minutes ago the minister is in it
he took the avenida corona that means
that he will come out on the santa marta
road travel south turn east over the
arroyo rebelde and so into the avenida
alejanrino

  and then jimmy shot the question at
him

  one of three things must happen after
kaufman enters the house otto stoll
the chauffeur will turn back over the bridge
and drive around for a fixed time or he will
go east on the avenue in the same purpose
or he will wait in front of the house until
kaufman comes out i dont think he
will do the second he will probably do
the first yet he may do the third it is
late it is dark and there are no houses
near

  and if he does the first or the second
interrogated jimmy

  he will be stopped a drunken man
will stagger into his path there will be
trouble-a fight both will be arrested
and locked up for the night and you will
get possession of the car but if otto
waits at the house it is not so simple a
commotion will bring kaufman out

  billy caught him up

  and theres where ill come in you
take care of otto and ill meet kaufman
with a story to account for my being at the
wheel he doesnt know me

  ortega lifted the curtain at his side and
peered out a street-lamp flashed by and
they were again in the dark

  this is the avenida bella vista he
informed them it is just south of the
avenida alejandrino and is built up only
a short distance we have passed the last
light we shall come presently to an open
field-ah we have reached it

  the car slowed down it turned off to
the right bumped along a few yards and
came to a stand

  we will get out here said ortega

  the car had brought up midway of an
unpaved weed-choked street that formed
a connecting-link between the two avenues
trees lined it but there were no buildings
ortega addressed a few words to his driver
after which with a low come to the boys
he struck off diagonally across the field to
hisjeft jimmy and billy followed billy
held the box of cigars clutched to him

they came at length to the grove
of conifers that fronted morales
house on the south side of the avenue
as they plunged into it a man stepped out
from the shelter of a tree jimmys hand
went to his pistol but he saw that ortega
was not disconcerted by the apparition
he advanced to the man and held a short
conference with him at its close the man
slipped away into the darkness ortega
returned

  it is all right he said we have ar-
rived in time

  i say don emilio submitted jimmy
suppose those others come-the rest of
the five we cant wait in front of the
house for kaufman if they do

  move to this side and say nothing
ortega replied my men will take care
of the other cars but ive really no hope
for the flag	

of such good fortune herr kaufman
doesnt want a debating society on his hands
tonight he will tell morales what to do
and morales will pass the word along he
added miss taylor went out early in
the evening and has not returned she
was walking

  what do you think of it jimmy asked
him

  im not thinking i shall have a report
on her later she was followed 

  they were quiet after this standing well
back among the trees their ears strained
to catch what sound the night might bring
from the west the bell of la caridad
beat distantly on the still air twelve o-
clock a while longer they stood

  ola

  it was ortega calling attention to a shape
looming in the street it came nearer
purring gently and stopped directly across
from them a smaller shape detached
itself from the larger and moved toward the
house they could hear the soft tapping
of leather on stone accented with a curious
regularity-tip-tap tip-tap the house-
door opened and a mans figure was re-
vealed in the faint light of the hall then
the door closed

  a bur-r-r came from the machine it
moved off described a half-circle and
went west

  quick hissed ortega to the boys

  he raced through the trees running in
a divergent line from the street when he
was out of the grove he waved high above
his head an electric-torch three times
but he did not check his steps and they
went on till they came to the intersecting
by-way their car was already there in
response to ortegas signal they tumbled
into it and sat panting for breath

 what are we waiting for gasped
jimmy as the machine throbbed under them
but did not stir

  to give the others time we dont
want to come up until they have taken
otto away

  for five minutes by ortegas watch they
stayed where they were then-

  vayase he barked at the man in front

  it was at the east end of the bridge that
they came upon the limousine a man
saluted as they drew up ortega ex-
changed a few hurried words with him and
they got out into the road

  stoll kicked up a row but they quieted

him said ortega grimly can you man-
age this machine of kaufmans he asked
of billy

  sure i can drive it in my sleep
try it out-over the bridge and turn
you havent many minutes to spare it may
be

  billy jumped into the drivers seat
ware there he cried to the man in the
road

  he switched on the head-lights for the
bridge crossed it and tore into the night

  jimmy said ortega gravely it all
rests with you now

  right you are don emilio jimmy re-
joined cheerfully dont worry youll
hear from me before day where shall
billy leave the car

  some one will be waiting here for it
dont let mr smith delay i shall want
to know how you got along

  billy was coming back he shut off
his lights after crossing the bridge and came
to a stop

  runs smooth as silk he remarked
i havent forgotten the cigars jimmy
theyre on the seat with me he sniggered
mischievously i hope our guest will
like the brand

  the policeman standing near muttered
something to himself cigars they were
thinking of in a time like this these ameri-
cans

  you must go said ortega good
luck my friends i will stay here till you
pass should anything happen that you
cant control fire one shot i will come
no matter what the cost

  he wrung their hands jimmy got in
and billy let the car slide easily away
he made a turn when he came to morales
house and came up to the walk headed for
the bridge a dim fight showed over the
door otherwise the place was dark for all
they could see at least fifteen minutes
had passed since kaufman entered the
house he might not issue from it for half
an hour-an hour-longer even it was
this uncertainty the delayed action that
bore heavily on the two one thing
however seemed assured there were to
be no other visitors this night

  they talked in hushed tones jimmy de-
tailing to billy the procedure he had deter-
mined on then he pushed the door open
noiselessly and squatted on the rear seat
next to the walk like a frog ready to leap


adventure

from the heart of the city after a time
came the sentinel call of the great church-
bell one stroke

  is that one oclock or half-past twelve
it seems a year whispered billy

  the half-after jimmy answered

  they fell silent again jimmy stretched
himself out on the seat to ease his stiffened
legs the minutes passed again the
clock boomed

  tsitl billy gave a warning sound

  the house-door was opening

  jimmy cautiously drew himself up to his
former crouching posture every nerve taut
as a fiddle-string the door closed and
the limping-tap of leather on stone followed
kaufman was coming to his car he was
muttering to himself in german angrily
it seemed something had gone wrong
with him

  his short paunchy form was at the car
now his foot was on the running-board
his head came in at the door then his shoul-
ders stooped to clear the lintel his eyes
were directed to the supposed otto sitting
at the wheel he was in the act of giving
him a command when one hundred and
fifty pounds of solid beef and bone crashed
down on his neck and flattened him to the
floor at the precise instant the car
started off the door swinging wide and the
imperial german envoys feet kicking the
air outside

  easy as two and two crowed billy
softly

jimmy snapped on the ceiling-
light he had one minute in which
to do the work he meditated
kaufmans wind was knocked out of him
but he would be getting it back and the
trouble would begin jimmy felt for one of
the germans hands found it jerked it
rudely up over his spine and slipped it into
the noose of a stout cord he had laid out
carefully on the seat in advance he found
the other hand and bound if securely to
the first

  hey whats the matter he yelped at
billy and snapped off the light

  the car had stopped at the bridge billy
spoke to some one in the street his voice
was coolly urgent

  shut that door please weve got a
sick man inside

  the imperial minister was shoved un-
gently on his nose to the farthest limit of

the floor and the door closed against his
protesting feet kaufman bellowed in in-
articulate rage crazed with the misad-
venture that had befallen him

  they passed the cane huts that fringed
the city and took up the santa marta
road jimmy switched on the ceiling-
light again he bent over kaufman and
exerting all his strength raised him and
plumped him into the seat-corner this
accomplished he ran his hand over his cap-
tives person and when it came away there
was a neat hammerless in it the man
kicked at him his heavy-lidded eyes
shot out venomous sparks spittle slimed
his beard a great guttural oath broke
from his snarling lips

  what did he say jimmy asked billy
id hate to tell you grinned the
boy

  he spoke to kaufman in his own tongue
a duel of words followed and suddenly
ended kaufman had regained in a degree
his self-control and he had found his en-
glish he delivered it at jimmy

  you shall answer for this you scoundrel
both of you and bitterly my person
is sacred i represent his imperial majesty
the kaiser at this capital

  i wish said jimmy evenly you were
in actuality that infamous man fortunate-
ly for yourself you are not

  ive told him hes a prisoner of war
offered billy that he has conspired against
the government of the united states and
that until we have dug up all the deviltry
he has set agoing he wont see his happy
home again

bah spat out kaufman the city
will be aroused tomorrow you will be
apprehended punished i shall see to that
you-release my hands i command you
jimmy gave him a cold smile

  you dont seem to take us seriously
herr kaufman you will do so later
that is all i have to say to you now

  he settled himself in his corner with the
ministers own pistol resting lazily in his
hand and ignored the flow of threats di-
rected at him they ceased shortly and
only the hum of the big machine devouring
the miles disturbed the silence

  the dipping down of the car told jimmy
that they had come to the ravine on the
other side of which lay the farm billy
put the car across the shallow stream with
due care and swung through the ruined
for the flag	

gateway jimmy looked at the time it
was a few minutes of half-past one

  give them the horn he bade billy
they will know what it means

  billy complied and when the car swept
out from the trees on to the plateau before
the house the headlights threw into relief
the little group waiting for them at the door
walter brewer stood in advance of his
daughter his thin form drawn up erect and
alert back of winifred to one side the
huge frame of the negro sam was lined
against the gray front of the building
jimmy jumped down from the car billy
followed

  here we are sir jimmy said to brewer
this is my friend and fellow-american

mr-

  better not cautioned billy

  mr blank finished jimmy

  brewer understood he came forward
and peered into the automobile

  you have him ah-yes-i see
will you descend herr kaufman
inquired jimmy pleasantly

  an oath was the response kaufman did
not move jimmys face set sternly

  there is a lady with us kaufman he
said i will advise you-this once only-
to guard speech in her presence

  sam i want you called brewer and
when the negro running was come to him
he said bring this man in you know
where to place him

  he led the way to the door here the
boys paused and came to a salute over
the entrance was draped the starry banner
of their country billy passed in with
brewer but jimmy detained winifred

  this is splendid of you he exclaimed
pointing to the flag i had not thought
of it it is the one thing needed to con-
vince this brute german that in entering
here he has americans to deal with

  her dark eyes were raised to the silken
folds

  i brought it from home she murmured
but it was father who placed it there
i wish you could know what this change
in him means to me

  she went in rather hurriedly

  jimmy heard sams voice raised persua-
sively to the solitary occupant of the car
and he tarried for an instant

  dey aint no use er bringin trubbel on
yerssf mister taint fur yer got ter go
jes a step er two de queschun tween

you an me is is yer gwine ter walk it or is i
got ter tote yer hits one er tuther an
i aint partickler which

  what kaufmans reply was jimmy could
not catch but he saw sam reach into the
car kaufman came forth in his grasp
and was headed for the house under forced
draft as a sailor would have termed it

  jimmy grinned to himself and passed in

chapter xvih

what happened in the city

there were strange happenings in
cortina on this same night in the
early hours of the evening- at forty min-
utes after eight to be exact-miss mary
taylor slipped secretly out of the house in
the avenue alejandrino and walked rapid-
ly in the direction of the calle central
she was supposed to be writing letters in
her room she had in fact given out that
she would be so engaged for at least two
hours

  if her absence was discovered mean-
while she would account for it in some off-
hand way-a little stroll in the near neigh-
borhood to rest her after her labors with
her pen dona natalia simple soul took
her for an eccentric anyway and don
manuel knew her for a self-reliant person
amply able to look out for herself in dark
or day

  miss taylor had good reason for her
secrecy this night mrs isaacs had sup-
plied her with the reason and after weighing
it to a nicety she was convinced that it was
sound and valid they must confer to-
gether without delay she walked on
engrossed with her thoughts and gave only
an unafraid glance to the shuffling mestizo
she overtook on her way along the avenue
the mans gait quickened the least bit
when she passed him when she reached
the calle central he was but fifty feet be-
hind her he lit a cigaret with an erratic
flourish of the match and continued at a
much slower pace

  miss taylor turned south on the calle
central a man loitering across the street
had seen the brandished match and loafed
along toward the south the supposi-
titious half-breed retraced his steps up the
avenue it was his beat for the night

  miss taylor pursued her way and her
thoughts she was casting over again her


adventure

interview with mrs isaacs that afternoon
she was in final review summing up each
word each look of the little woman they
were she decided in harmony throughout
and crowning all was one indisputable fact
certified to by morales when on his arrival
home before dinner he had given her an
account of mrs isaacs call on him in the
morning yes beyond doubt it was wise
to keep this rendezvous

  she began questioning the street names
at the corners for she was drawing near to
the calle dolores she came to it with the
next block followed it east until opposite
the park found the number she had been
given and as instructed tapped lightly on
the door mrs isaacs herself responded
to the knock

  a moment afterward the man loitered
along he made a swift examination of
the premises at no  and lounged over
to the park he glanced about and moved
a bench from one of the paths into the deep
shadows of a clump of shrubbery there
were but a few persons passing through the
park the number grew less as time went
by and finally the place was abandoned
of all save the concealed watcher on the
bench

  the night was warm and still and the
man yawned wearily more than once la
caridad struck ten then the half-hour
the house gave no outward sign of life
the man caught himself nodding now and
then and straightened up but he nodded
again and again and at length his head
fell forward on his breast and stayed there

  at  the door of no  opened and
an insignificant little figure stepped out
the door was shut noiselessly it could be
opened only from the inner side unless one
was provided with a latch-key mrs
isaacs flitted off in the dark toward the
calle central where she hoped to find a cab

  eleven oclock from the cathedral bell
dinged its way into the consciousness of the
man on the park-bench he roused guilti-
ly he had slept for twenty minutes
what had happened in the meantime
he was in for a grilling at the central office
if the woman he had followed had slipped him

  as he looked he saw that the thin strip
of light he had noted below the drawn
window-shades was gone and so was the
woman it was probable unless-another
thought-she was spending the night there
he crossed over to the house the street

was deserted and he resolved on a bold
expedient he advanced to the door and
rang the bell he could hear it shrilling
somewhere in the rear it went unan-
swered he tried the door softly and rang
again-three times at half-minute inter-
vals there was no response the man
cursed at himself

  they sleep well these people he mut-
tered either she is gone or she remains
till morning he reflected a moment
two women there would have been
leave-takings always there is that and
i would have heard i was but nodding
she rests here for the night it is a cer-
tainty i will wait and see twenty
minutes only pah and two women
my skin is saved

  he hugged this comforting assurance
to himself and returned to his vigil on the
bench resolved to stick it out till morning
and note who should come forth from this
devils hutch constructed solely to keep an
honest man from bed

  inside the house miss mary taylor lay
stretched out on a couch in the living-room
sunk in a soundless sleep consequent on a
glass of claret she had swallowed when
making ready to take her departure the
wine was to have fortified her against her
walk home mrs isaacs in sisterly com-
radeship had drunk of it with her though
without untoward results it appeared

  the bosom of miss taylors dress gaped
open in unseemly fashion a small pearl
grip pistol lay on the floor beside the couch
a jeweled bracelet-watch encircled her
wrist and a ring of value her finger one
might have imagined that a pillaging-hand
had been busy with the young womans toi-
let and yet strangely enough had spared
an obvious loot

on the party-wall between the
valdera warehouse and the ger-
man legation was a broken weather-
beaten soap-box some one had carelessly
thrown it up on the wall at a forgotten
period and there a worthless derelict it
had persisted ever since enrique segovia
hailed the box as a boon its coverless top
faced him and through a rent in the bottom
he could command the legation roof his
head sheltered as by a hunters blind

  not fifteen yards distant was the flag-
pole five yards farther on the breast-
high parapet was outlined to his eye the
for the flag



flagpole rose thirty feet above the roof
well over the surrounding buildings and
was supported by guy-rods from midway
its length

 it was a long soul-harrowing wait
segovia had to endure for it was not until
the quarter-hour after twelve that any
move was made within the enemys terrain
he had been sorely tempted to go over and
cut down the pole out of hand but decided-
against it they might find other means of
raising the antenna and his work would go
for nothing-he would not have another
chance at the wireless they would see to
that

  but now at last his patience was rewarded
the scuttle opened and two men appeared
they spoke in german not loud yet with
no great suppression of voice it was
plain that fear of eavesdroppers did not
disturb them one of them walked to the
parapet and peered into the street the
other came toward the party-wall segovia
guessed from his square-cut figure that
it was gustave landeker for he knew the
legation attaches by sight

  he crouched and held his breath feeling
for the rubber-covered handle of the hatchet
in his belt but landeker or whoever it
was gave a perfunctory survey of the ware-
house-roof and went back the other
man had returned to the flagstaff

 segovia was up again viewing them
through his box he saw them lift a
board off what seemed to him a long wide
slit in the roof he saw them loosen the guy-
rods and unstep the pole as they would a
mast and lower it through the opening
and after ten minutes more or less he saw
the pole rise the men lay hold of it and
grunting with the effort replace it in its
socket for now the pole was topped with
a fan-shaped collection of wires upheld by
an insulator

  the legation would be calling the camp
at arraca presently and it was not hard to
guess the news they would send to pre-
vent this was the task set for segovia and
he realized that only by unexampled good
fortune could he accomplish it here were
two sturdy men armed no doubt either
one was his match in strength either one
he was persuaded would go to any length
to defeat his purpose if he should leap
the wall they would be upon him before he
could advance a yard and then it
would be a silent straining struggle in

which he would be worsted-unless he
plied the murderous weapon at his side

  it was a sickening thought and segovia
shrank from it and yet delay spelled
failure he imagined-so wrought up was
his fancy-that he could hear through the
open hatch the spark-balls crackling in the
cellar far below he was about to risk all
and vault the wall trusting to his felt-shod
feet to land him silently when he saw one
of the germans go to the scuttle and pre-
pare to descend through it he waited
tensely

  with but a single man to deal with his
chances of success would be enhanced a
hundred-fold the man descended the
other idled about humming a snatch from
an opera segovia recognized it-from
tannhauser the pilgrims chorus how
perfectly secure the fellow felt

  the man was approaching the party-
wall segovia instantly conceived a plan
of action he marked in his mind the spot
at which the man was likely to pull up
squatted low and backed away paused a
vital moment to gather his energies then
hurled himself at the barrier and over it
his hope was to catapult into the other and
bowl him off his feet or if not that so to
disconcert him that he could not take an
immediate offensive

  it was a miss on both counts segovia
botched the jump his toe caught on the
top course of bricks and he tumbled in a
heap on the opposing roof before he
could recover himself a pistol-butt ham-
mered on his head a quiver ran through
his limbs and he was whisked away out of
his senses

  he came to himself in a lighted back-room
of the legation building some one was
trickling raw brandy down his throat from
a flask he choked and coughed and
opened his eyes he was stretched out on
the floor with a chair cushion under his
head the man bending over him raised
up an ironical smile curved his lips
he spoke in spanish but with a pronounced
accent

  ah you recognize me i see senor

  gottfried neiderlein segovia mum-
bled

  your devoted servant lieutenant don
enrique segovia let me congratulate
you on your recovery gustave was a
little afraid that the medicine he adminis-
tered was too potent he paused but


adventure

his unpleasant smile persisted well
he continued we still go on senor lieu-
tenant

  he strode to the door and opened it
the hum of a dynamo charging the con-
densers of the wireless in the cellar stole
into the room segovia clenched his teeth
to stifle a groan he had failed miserably
and completely the man returned to
him

  there is water in the corner he said
you may wish to use it shall i help you
up senor lieutenant

  no answered segovia shortly and
for your information i will say that i no
longer have a claim to the title you give me
i have resigned my commission in the
army

  oho this act of yours then is that of
a simple citizen no one to blame but you
tjn bum chistel

segovia vouchsafed no reply
he drew upon will-power and com-
pelled himself to a sitting posture
from this he clambered painfully to his feet
his head was like a whirligig on his shoul-
ders and he staggered to a chair and
dropped into it the german placed the
flask on a table near him

  i will leave this with you he said
i would advise a stiff drink now you
will be the better for it these windows
you will observe are barred the door i
will lock his excellency will decide what
further is to be done with you

  segovia consulted his watch it was one
oclock he prayed that jimmy had not
failed as he had done

  herr kaufman is not in the legation
he asked

  the other gave him a quick glance

  he is here he replied

  segovias heart sank but he spoke with
forced indifference

  then say to him that unless he comes
very shortly to his decision he will find it
taken from him

  ha you threaten

  i counsel my friends good herr
neiderlein are not all dead

  bah you have invaded the legation
his excellency will know how to require
satisfaction meanwhile your friends can
whistle on the doorstep

  neiderlein marched out and the key
rasped in the lock after him acting on the

mans advise segovia reached for the brandy
flask and drank from it direct slowly and
sparingly it put life into him and he got
up and took stock of himself he had been
relieved of course of his hatchet and pistol
but otherwise he was not disabled-his
bones were sound he went over to the
wash-stand in the comer and surveyed
himself in the mirror suspended above it

  he turned from the picture in disgust
his face was grimed with the dirt of die roof
and streaked with blood from a gash over
one eye and his head behind the right ear
was wofully bruised it was the mark of
gustave landekers vehement attention to
him

  segovia washed the grime from his face
and used some of the brandy as a lotion for
his wounds after this he resumed his
chair and lighted a cigaret half an hour
went by neiderlein unlocked the door
and looked in segovia fancied there was
an air of uneasiness about him neither
spoke and the german after an irresolute
pause went away

  segovia knitted-his brows had neid-
erlein lied about kaufman had jimmy
succeeded in as great a degree as he him-
self had failed ah then the legation
would have something to wire arraca that
was news indeed he was jubilant with
the thought he forgot his own failure
his own unease of body and reveled in
the growing assurance of his friends tri-
umph singularly enough not once did
the image of mary taylor present itself
except in the merest shadowy outline-
an inconclusive background figure in a
stirring canvas

  it was striking two when neiderlein again
appeared in the door segovia was con-
vinced that he was correct in his deduction
concerning kaufman the man was plain-
ly worried he entered and stood re-
garding his captive with a lowering face

  you have come with a message for me
from his imperial excellency questioned
segovia mockingly

  neiderlein strode over to him

  where is he he demanded

  segovia raised his eyes in surprise

  where is who

  herr kaufman

  why has he gone i understood you
to say that he was here in the legation

  neiderlein scowled at him menacingly

  it doesnt matter what you understood
for the flag



ortega will be glad to see that car again

mr brewer this is mr-

  leave it off cut in the boy wrinkling
his nose just plain billy smith sir-
billy to my friends miss brewer hasnt
called me so yet but im hopeful

  jimmy glanced at winifred her eyes
were dancing it was a new phase of her
to him and he could have hugged billy for
bringing it forth and he heard from
brewer a foreign sound the man was
laughing not loud but in a stifled sort
of way as though he was fearful of letting
the unaccustomed emotion have free play

  i will do it for her billy-for us both
brewer said and we shall hope to see
you back soon

  its that what bothers me replied the
boy how am i going to get back if i
hire a machine it will be like trailing an
anise bag cross country for the hounds
to follow and to walk is a pretty stiff stroll
for a chap out of training

  you are not coming back not right
away jimmy told him you are to stay
in town and pick up news therell be
doings today if im not mistaken

  we could send sam in for him after
dark suggested brewer billy could
walk out on the santa marta road and
meet him id go myself but i dont
drive

  winifred had turned thoughtful she
was debating a point that had suddenly
presented itself

  i think she said slowly it would be a
wise thing to do if you both went back
i think that mr perry ought to be seen
around town tomorrow it would throw
them off the track perhaps though im
not sure i am afraid they will have a clue
to herr kaufmans whereabouts

  jimmy directed a startled look at her
a clue he exclaimed the tiling was
done absolutely without a hitch what
clue could he have left

  it isnt that winifred said nothing
positive its a clue by inference it did
not occur to me until mr smith-until
billy-explained why he came tonight
instead of mr segovia tell me is this
miss taylor tall with close-cut yellow hair
and eyes like-like tourmalines-some-
times-and again like-

like prussian blue interpolated billy
yes yes jimmy made an eager step
forward you have seen her where

  here it was yesterday after you had
gone she drove in with another woman
she expressed surprise at finding the place
occupied she said shed been told it was a
quaint old house and she desired to see it
jimmy dashed his fist into his palm
here indeed was a discovery

  i met her as i was going out he cried
she simply wanted to learn what brought
me here

  well she didnt learn gave out
brewer we didnt ask her in i let her
see that she wasnt welcome

  it was the last thing he should have done
decided jimmy but he did not voice it
winifred was speaking to him

  i did not think anything of it at the
time i put her visit down to idle curiosity
and even now i dont just understand what
brought her you are a stranger in

cortina-

  spying is the womans business inter-
rupted jimmy and im a friend of
enrique it was enough for her she
wasnt overlooking any bets and i was
cracking her up to you only that morning
heavenly powers

  he laughed ruefully

  the least little glimmer of complacency
brightened the girls eyes but it was
instantly quenched

      of course you couldnt know
      she said i was rather pleased
      with her she has an engaging

manner

  part of her equipment snorted jimmy
  billy spoke

  miss brewer is dead right jimmy
you must go with me sister mary will
begin to gossip as soon as she learns kauf-
man has turned up missing say it would
be a joke to go into morales bank and get a
bill changed gosh that would set em
back a peg or two

  jimmy looked dubiously at winifred

  i reckon its the thing to do but it
leaves you short-handed here you must
be dead for sleep and you mr brewer

 dont fancy the thought-

  we slept in the afternoon put in
brewer briskly and anyway sam and
i can relieve each other at kaufmans door
winny may go to bed when she likes
jimmy hesitated still he was frowning
at his swift-succeeding thoughts

  tonight wont matter i suppose he


adventure

  on what

  on developments

  kaufman glowered at him from under his
bushy brows he knew what was implied

  you have done this thing at the in-
stance of the zanhorian government
you are in its pay

  wrong jimmy answered i did it
on my individual responsibility i am not
in the pay of any government i am a
private american citizen it came to my
knowledge that you were making mischief
for america i decided to put a spoke in
your wheel ive done it whatever the
consequence i am willing to assume it
and i will repeat mr minister what my
young friend said to you in the car you will
remain here until the plot you have hatched
against my country is uncovered after
that-

  you will pay a price for this thrust in
kaufman wrathfully you will all pay
and it will not be reckoned in gold ver-
damml amerikander schwdn

  he clutched a chair with a hairy hand
gave it a twirl and sat down with his back
deliberately turned to them jimmy
grinned at brewer

  the gentlemans pleasant way of bid-
ding us goodnight he remarked let
us go

  they left the german sitting as he was
and closed the door on him brewer shot
to a bolt on it

  i put it there he said and this too
is my work we shall want to know what
goes on in there he indicated a slit
sawed in the door a slide was arranged
to cover it at will

  agood idea-bangup declared jimmy
and he could see the man warm to the praise
sam here is a little something i promised
you a yellow coin was pressed into the
negros great paw suppose sam takes the
first watch until we can decide on a sched-
ule he suggested to brewer its
hardly necessary perhaps but it is just as
well to let kaufman know that we intend
to keep an eye on him from the start
exactly agreed brewer sam fetch
a chair and mind you dont go to sleep
if that person gets away its a hanging
matter for all of us do you understand
i does boss sam replied with an
earnestness that denoted a literal interpre-
tation of the portentous words

  jimmy chuckled to himself as they went

  up the hall to the living-room into which
billy and winifred disappeared brewer
was certainly blossoming out into another
man jimmy was glad for brewers sake
for winifreds sake and-yes-for his own
sake it was hard lines to be condemned
to contempt for the father of the girl he felt
so strongly drawn to he was genuinely
rejoiced to see this change in brewer and
the leaven that had worked it was the most
inspiriting aspect of the case it had lifted
worse men to redeeming heights of honor
and repute

hbilly was inspecting the guns
ortega had sent out he had intro-
duced himself to winifred in his
own proper name and explained why it
was he had taken segovias place in the car
his light-hearted way of projecting events
on the screen of his personal preoption of
results was irresistible and winifred smiled
despite the anxiety that rested on her in
the knowledge of the grave step to which
they all were committed

  billy seemed to regard it simply as a
harum-scarum adventure that would make
good reading in a magazine or it might
have been that he was making little of the
danger in an effort to comfort her women
in billys well-matured opinion were
creatures of small courage otherwise why
should they take fright at a mouse or a
hundred harmless creeping tilings he could
name

  of course he was saying they will
set up an awful holler at the legation when
they find old doctor kaufman is missing
from their midst but what can they do
who is going to tell them where he is
echo answers-who-o-o

  winifred laughed

  suppose she answers here

  billy patted the mauser he was holding

  why then we may have a use for this
but dont you worry miss brewer echo
isnt irish shell answer according to rule
hist- as jimmy and brewer entered-
here comes the leader of the black hand
neat little blow-pipes these jimmy he
rattled on ive a bet with miss brewer
that give me an arm rest and the wind right

i	can hit a church at fifty feet three times
out of ten want to come in on the
money

  youd better be hitting the road home
young fellow jimmy retorted senor
for the flag



ortega will be glad to see that car again

mr brewer this is mr-

  leave it off cut in the boy wrinkling
his nose just plain billy smith sir-
billy to my friends miss brewer hasnt
called me so yet but im hopeful

  jimmy glanced at winifred her eyes
were dancing it was a new phase of her
to him and he could have hugged billy for
bringing it forth and he heard from
brewer a foreign sound the man was
laughing not loud but in a stifled sort
of way as though he was fearful of letting
the unaccustomed emotion have free play

  i will do it for her billy-for us both
brewer said and we shall hope to see
you back soon

  its that what bothers me replied the
boy how am i going to get back if i
hire a machine it will be like trailing an
anise bag cross country for the hounds
to follow and to walk is a pretty stiff stroll
for a chap out of training

  you are not coming back not right
away jimmy told him you are to stay
in town and pick up news therell be
doings today if im not mistaken

  we could send sam in for him after
dark suggested brewer billy could
walk out on the santa marta road and
meet him id go myself but i dont
drive

  winifred had turned thoughtful she
was debating a point that had suddenly
presented itself

  i think she said slowly it would be a
wise thing to do if you both went back
i think that mr perry ought to be seen
around town tomorrow it would throw
them off the track perhaps though im
not sure i am afraid they will have a clue
to herr kaufmans whereabouts

  jimmy directed a startled look at her
a clue he exclaimed the tiling was
done absolutely without a hitch what
clue could he have left

  it isnt that winifred said nothing
positive its a clue by inference it did
not occur to me until mr smith-until
billy-explained why he came tonight
instead of mr segovia tell me is this
miss taylor tall with close-cut yellow hair
and eyes like-like tourmalines-some-
times-and again like-

like prussian blue interpolated billy
yes yes jimmy made an eager step
forward you have seen her where

  here it was yesterday after you had
gone she drove in with another woman
she expressed surprise at finding the place
occupied she said shed been told it was a
quaint old house and she desired to see it
jimmy dashed his fist into his palm
here indeed was a discovery

  i met her as i was going out he cried
she simply wanted to learn what brought
me here

  well she didnt learn gave out
brewer we didnt ask her in i let her
see that she wasnt welcome

  it was the last thing he should have done
decided jimmy but he did not voice it
winifred was speaking to him

  i did not think anything of it at the
time i put her visit down to idle curiosity
and even now i dont just understand what
brought her you are a stranger in

cortina-

  spying is the womans business inter-
rupted jimmy and im a friend of
enrique it was enough for her she
wasnt overlooking any bets and i was
cracking her up to you only that morning
heavenly powers

  he laughed ruefully

  the least little glimmer of complacency
brightened the girls eyes but it was
instantly quenched

      of course you couldnt know
      she said i was rather pleased
      with her she has an engaging

manner

  part of her equipment snorted jimmy
  billy spoke

  miss brewer is dead right jimmy
you must go with me sister mary will
begin to gossip as soon as she learns kauf-
man has turned up missing say it would
be a joke to go into morales bank and get a
bill changed gosh that would set em
back a peg or two

  jimmy looked dubiously at winifred

  i reckon its the thing to do but it
leaves you short-handed here you must
be dead for sleep and you mr brewer

 dont fancy the thought-

  we slept in the afternoon put in
brewer briskly and anyway sam and
i can relieve each other at kaufmans door
winny may go to bed when she likes
jimmy hesitated still he was frowning
at his swift-succeeding thoughts

  tonight wont matter i suppose he


adventure

conceded its the day that worries me
if the taylor woman does suspect us we
will have those germans out here for a
rescue

  weve got to risk it declared billy
the longer we can keep em guessing the
better

  yes approved winifred and as
father has said sam will meet you only i
think it will be better if it is at noon he
can go to the post-office and from there to
the santa marta road and pick you up
jimmy shook his head

  sam must stay he is worth two
ordinary men and kaufman is afraid of
him this man diego who works about the
place can he drive your car

  tio diego winifred smiled you
couldnt coax him into the machine he
believes it is a contrivance of the evil one
but the matter is easily arranged i will
come for you

  you this did not appeal to jimmy
he eyed brewer if there should be

trouble in town-

  brewer interposed

  winifred is not afraid shes not that
kind and youd better be going it will
be getting light in another two hours
brewers manner was authoritative
jimmy bowed to it winifreds eyes rested
on her father with a little flash of pride in
which doubt yet had part for the miracle
of his transformation was a thing so new
to her that she feared to accept it wholly
lest it pass and leave her in greater depths
than before

  billy was already at the door impatient
to be away

  come on midas jr he called its
nearly two were wasting time

  brewer saw them off

  dont be uneasy about us he said to
jimmy we will keep our end up

  by jove sir im sure of it jimmy
rejoined and impulsively held out his hand
to him

  when they had crossed the ravine and
were burning up the road to town billy
sundered the silence that reigned between
them he giggled as he spoke

  and i was trying to stiffen her spine-
that girl thought she was the scary kind
oh gee

  youve a lot to learn smith said
jimmy shortly

  with a teacher like that you bet

  the laugh was still on the boys lips when
the car rose up under them and went wild
for a perilous moment billy cut off the
gas and brought it to a grinding halt
jimmy was pitched forward against the
windshield and the singular thing was
that the car itself pitched and rocked in a
curious gentle rhythm the pit of jimmys
stomach fell in and a sickening nausea fol-
lowed then as suddenly the movement
ceased

  good lord what was it he gasped

  automatically he pulled out his watch
the hands pointed to three minutes after
two

  a quake billy answered he was
feeling sick himself well wait a minute
there may be another they come usually
in pairs

  there was another though it was not so
severe as the first but billy waited for a
time after it had passed he wished to
make sure that the disturbance was entirely
over

  its the third ive known since ive
been out here and i dont like them he
volunteered in a strained voice they
say its old borazo yawning-that big
mountain back there nothing serious
they claim but i dont know one of
these days he may yawn too long and
then-i guess we can go on now

 hold up jimmy spoke sharply
perhaps wed better go back to the house
the quake may have damaged it

  that old stone barracks its been
standing half a century old borazo
would have to do more than yawn to bowl
it down in the city they havent even
turned over in bed for this baby shock
they are used to em

  billy pressed the starter and they took
up the road again jimmy had nothing
to say until they had left the country
behind and crossed the bridge at the
arroyo rebelde a tropic earth tremor
is not a tongue-loosener for the outlander till
he is thoroughly over his fright

chapter xx

in the night hours

 i heir headlights picked up a man at
the farther side of the bridge he
raised his hand in a signal to them

  its the chap ortega said hed have
for the flag

ioi

waiting for us i reckon jimmy remarked

  billy slowed to a stop the man came
to them his eyes lifted as he saw that
there were two persons in the car but he
offered no comment

  from the senor superintendent he said
in spanish with your permission gen-
tlemen i will drive

  ask him if they felt the earthquake
here jimmy requested of billy i cant
find the words for it

  the man shrugged in reply to the ques-
tion

  as one stretches himself in his sleep
senor no more

  you see borazos yawn billy re-
minded jimmy the natives think noth-
ing of it

  they came to morales house gliding
softly by with lights out but lights
showed in the house they were astir
there at this unseemly hour of the night
billy whispered a conjecture

  perhaps the legation has been tele-
phoning kaufman would have gone there
from morales for news from arraca they
want to know what keeps him

  it may be that mrs morales is worse
suggested jimmy ironically too bad we
cant leave our cards

  they swung into the calle central
proceeded north two blocks and drew up
at ortegas private office door

  rap four times instructed their con-
ductor when they had descended

  with this he drove away

  ortega opened to them if he was sur-
prised at jimmys return to town his face
did not show it when they were inside
and seated he looked at jimmy

  well was all he said

  quite well jimmy grinned at him
hes under lock and key

  quiet as a lamb if not so eatable put
in billy

  jimmy gave his reason for returning
ortega approved it

  miss brewer was right it was well
thought of he said brewer himself-
will he hold out i know as you are aware
his history

  billy was all ears at this jimmy
noted it

  yes he answered briefly have you
heard from enrique

no i am a little uneasy about him
ortegd glanced at a clock on his desk

they raised the wireless two hours ago
  um you know that sir

  yes i watched with a night glass from
the roof

  mrs isaacs snapped jimmy its
what she did-used a glass but pshawl
im off on that again mr lane says shes
a harmless little creature she called on
him-

  he left off some one was knocking at
the door insistently and without pause
segovia cried billy

  don emilios hand was on the knob
opening the door it was segovia he
stood alert and listening on the step for
a moment then he entered and threw
himself into the first chair his clothing
was torn the gash over his eye had
recently bled afresh and his face was
stained from it he breathed in gulping
gasps

  by jove from your looks youve had
an experience old man exclaimed jimmy
here swallow this

  ortega had produced a bottle and de-
canted a glass of wine segovia drained it
greedily

  get your wind before you try to talk
ortega bade him and went into an adjoining
room

  but segovia did not obey him
kaufman he panted at jimmy
you-got-him

  easy as falling down stairs billy
smith here drove

  segovia nodded at billy

  good he wheezed

  ortega came in with a washbasin and
towel he set the basin on the desk

  wash up and youll feel better don
enrique he advised

  enrique got up he bathed his face and
hands brushed off his clothes and returned
to his seat

  im right again he avowed got
my wind it was a run that landeker
chased me i expected a shot in the back
any minute but i guess he was afraid of
the row it would make he gave up and
i came on

  suppose you begin with the roof
submitted ortega quietly what took
place up there

  srgovia made an apologetic gesture
oh yes of course im ahead of my
story

  he related the occurrences at the legation


adventure

  his audience gave him a hushed atten-
tion but when he arrived at the point where
neiderlein drew his pistol on him billy
broke in excitedly

gee he ejaculated did he shoot
even ortega laughed and billy grinned
as he realized the bull he had perpetrated

  it was at that instant the quake came
said segovia you can imagine what
happened don emilio neiderlein is new
to the country i struck at his arm it
sent the weapon flying and we were at each
others throat but his fright gave me the
advantage i got him down to his knees-
and to his back-and i battered his head
on the floor i took the pistol went out
and locked him in

  well done said ortega and then
  segovia continued-

  i found my hatchet on a stand outside
the door together with my pistol i knew
what to do then the cellar stairs were
close by i ran to them the wireless
operator was coming up he too was
frightened but not so that he had lost his
wits when he saw me he seemed at once
to understand what had passed he
charged at me

  i hurled neiderleins gun at him it
took him full in the chest he lost his
balance-there was no rail to hang to-
and he went over backward down the stairs
it was a nasty fall and he didnt move
afterward i thought he was dead but
i couldnt stop to find out i remembered
landeker up on the roof hed be coming
down perhaps

well i found on the operators
table duplicates of the messages
hed been sending and receiving
neiderlein load the originals i suppose i
gathered them up and stuffed them in my
pocket then i went at his condensers
with my hatchet-at his key and spark-
balls i smashed everything in sight
and in some way i cant explain i cut the
electric light circuit anyway everything
went dark

  gosh exclaimed billy breathlessly

  he was sitting on the extreme edge of his
chair carried out of himself by the recital
segovia went on

  i had matches and i struck one it
showed me the stairs and i made for them
i wanted to get out of that place i had
one foot on the steps when i felt the other

gripped by the man on the ground he had
come to we had it out fast and furious
he was hurt i could tell by his groans i
managed to break loose from him at last
and climbed the stairs it was ticklish
business in the dark when i got up
i didnt know where i was and i wanted to
find the street door i struck another
match the door was straight ahead and
so was landeker he was groping his way
to the cellar i blew out the match but
he had seen me of course

  the deuce fumed jimmy as segovia
paused to light a cigaret you can do
that later get on

  ortega said nothing he waited pa-
tiently segovia inhaled zestfully

  the first ive had in an hour he men-
tioned and proceeded with his story
there is not much more to tell landeker
would have taken a shot at me im sure
but he was afraid that some one was behind
me and he would hit him he called out
in german and neiderlein set up a cry
from the room i could hear landeker
coming and dropped to my knees i was
lucky i caught his legs and jerked them
from under him and i got a stiff kick in the
stomach as he went over it pretty nearly
did for me but i was up before he was and
found the door fortunately it wasnt
locked and i was in the street with a fair
start of landeker

  and you came here direct inquired
ortega gently

  not so i knew enough for that i ran
north to the calle cristina east a block
south three and west here i lost landeker
after the second turn

  that was well praised the superin-
tendent

  by george enrique exploded jimmy
ours was tame as a sunday-school picnic
beside your performance youre an honor
to the old tech

   segovia looked pleased but he said
im not so sure of that you see they
had their say back and forth with arraca
before i got my work in thats the mis-
chief of it they sent off that washington
dispatch of course and i have a notion
neiderlein let them know he feared for
kaufmans safety but here is the stuff
he drew from his pocket a sheaf of papers
smoothed out the rumpled sheets on his
knee and passed them to ortega at the
desk saying-

m
for the flag



  german but we can find some-
body-

  right here cried jimmy elatedly
billy do your stunt

  billy studied the sheets a moment and
looked up with a bored air

  in code it might as well be choctaw
for all i can make of it

  segovia stared blankly at jimmy

  an honor to old poly-oh yes i am
he jeered bitterly ive raised the devil
and thats all

  you wrecked the plant they wont
be talking back and forth in a hurry
consoled jimmy thats a lot at this
stage of the game

   ortega smiled in his quiet way

  you have done a good nights work all
of you my friends we can guess what
these messages say in a general way or
if we cant it is not a vital matter the
thing is weve got the key to the situation
in herr kaufman and weve stopped the
conversations with the lumber camp now
we will get some sleep against what may
happen when day comes ive a car waiting
for you in the yard don enrique you
can deop jimmy at his hotel and mr

smith-

   billy sir put in the boy

  and billy-

  billy stays with me tonight spoke up
jimmy and its only a step or two to
the hotel well walk it enrique is all
in pack him home good night old
chap see you later-somewhere

  he gripped enriques hand and hustled
him to the door despite his protests
ortega had touched a button and a man
stood ready to pilot the worn-out young
zanhorian to the car

  well arent you going asked ortega
quizzically of the two who remained it
is three oclock

   i just wanted to say sir that morales
house was lighted up when we passed
replied jimmy i was about to mention
it when enrique came in do you think
the legation has been talking to morales
very likely but there is another thing
that is worrying him miss taylor has not
returned or she had not at the last report
an hour ago

  the boys stared at him

  thats funny observed jimmy who
of course meant exactly the opposite

  don emilio shrugged

  excessively so he commented dryly

  they were leaving when jimmy be-
thought himself of another question

  if i am overcurious stop me but i
would like to know sir if the detectaphone
was of any help did they use the dining-
room

  yes but their talk was low my man
could catch only snatches of it they
intend to rescind american concessions
in the republic for one thing and to make
the abrogation general if they succeed in
their dream of creating a united states of
central america thats of interest to
you other points deal with the methods
of the revolution which by the way waits
only on a word from peralta and we were
right about the card you saw in the bank
it was kaufmans call for a meeting on
sunday night-the committee he termed
it

  but the names of the committee
werent they mentioned

  ortega shook his head

  they go by numbers it appears only
one name was spoken a womans-a
miss prietz herr kaufman was exercised
about her she had failed him in some
way-what way the detectaphone missed-
and much it seems depended on her

  another woman exclaimed jimmy

  the superintendent met this with his
cryptic smile

  a woman may have more names than
one

  miss taylor

  quien sabe good night i shall sleep
here

mr ricardo gomez himself
took jimmy up in the lift to his
room he had inquired solicitously
about segovia and now he said

   it is a night of retardation of the sleep
caballeros you are not single in your
deferment the madame of your country
-new york-her also is arrived muy tarde
oho t

  you mean mrs isaacs jimmy re-
garded him curiously

  si es la una-one oclock-her is
came

  billy exchanged a glance with jimmy
but to mr gomez disappointment neither
remarked on the information it was not
until they were in the room that they spoke

   what do you think of that asked billy


adventure

  to the deuce with mrs isaacs snapped
jimmy crossly ive quit guessing about
her shut up and get to bed im dead
tired

enrique segovia meanwhile
was adding to his adventures of
the night his way home led
through the calle dolores as the car
came abreast of the park the driver uttered
a queer exclamation and threw out his
clutch

  what is it demanded segovia sleepily

  mateo of the force and a woman
there is trouble

  mateos watch had been rewarded he
had saved his skin or at least he was so
persuaded the woman had come forth
from the house the heave of the earth-
shock had penetrated to her deadened con-
sciousness and brought to her the first
stirrings of awakened life slowly through
the mental fog in which she was lost she
had made her way to thought then to
leaden action in which minutes crawled
onward to an hour and when at last she
was out of the place of her imprisonment
she had stood looking about her bewilder-
edly endeavoring to get her bearings

  her will to do returned and she started
down the street in the direction of the
calle central she reeled weakly-
drunkenly mateo thought-and he had
hastened over to her from the park he
had offered cunningly to aid her to see
her to whatever place she was in mind to go
the woman had waved him off had in
fact flourished a revolver at him

  it was this sight as he peered from the
machine that caught segovias eye he
got out and ran forward to the pair a cry
broke from him

  miss taylor-mary my god

  enrique

  miss taylor thrust the pistol in her waist
and let herself droop toward him she was
indeed sick and shaken and yet her
clouded faculties responded to the im-
perious demand she made upon them
she moaned piteously

  take me home oh take me home

  yes yes at once segovia assured her
but what has happened to you why
are you wandering on the streets-at this
hour-in this part of the city and the
man-he would not have harmed you he
is a police officer

  miss taylor drooped pronouncedly on
his arm

  take me home enrique she pleaded
i am dreadfully ill i will tell you as we
go take me home

  mateo had fallen back to the car
he was in low rapid colloquy with the
driver as segovia came up mateo touched
his hat to him

  she came out of  senor he said and
walked away

  segovia helped his charge into the car
she sank upon the cushions with a long
sobbing sigh

  to the senor morales house in the
avenida alejandrino segovia directed
he turned to his companion her head
had fallen to one side shes fainted
he cried out drive like the devil man
he chafed the girls hot dry hands but
with no response from her his senses
were in a whirl this staggering event
bursting from out the curtain of the night
on him had scattered his wits he could
not think collectively he could only
wonder in a dazed way what it all meant

  they were nearing morales house he
called marys name softly urgent her
eyes opened she pressed the hand holding
hers he bent down to her

  i am better she murmured

  thank god you have given me a
horrible fright

  they were at the house stopping she
sat up with unexpected energy

  stay at home until i send for you to-
morrow she breathed in his ear i will
tell you then i am not able-tonight-
to go through with it

  of course not he soothed to-
morrow-or never it rests with you i
do not ask a word

  she gave him a strange look and of a
sudden a fugitive kiss brushed his cheek

  you are a dear boy-a dear boy she
said with a catch in her voice no i
can get out alone i am much better
dont wait go i wish it

  she stepped down unaided from the car
some one was opening the door of the
house

  vayal she bade the driver and went
slowly up the walk to the beckoning door

  enrique athrill with the kiss she had
bestowed on him yet found his lips me-
chanically repeating the words of mateo
as he drove away from dolores street-
she came out of  senor they had
glanced off his mind at the time but they
came back now knocking for admittance
she came out of 

  why that was brewers late residence
had a new tenant been found for it in this
short space if so who who in three
days could have established such a claim
on mary that she should spend long hours
in the house-for of course she had gone
there early-and then be brutally turned
forth in the dead of night to find her way
home alone and ill who

  a thought presented itself to enrique that
made the blood surge like liquid fire in his
veins that caused his nails to bite into
his palms until the very pain of it cleared
his vision no not that mary was
above suspicion it would all be made plain
to him in the morning something so far
out of the ordinary that it could not be
guessed had influenced her some-
thing   

  oh my god he cried in his heart
and i must wait

  not until he was at home and in bed did
it occur to enrique amid the dark jumble
of his reflections that here was no secret
he could hold as his own two other men
shared it with him and tomorrow don
emilio would make a third what could
he say if questioned by him request him
to wait until he had heard from mary

  enrique did not sleep as he had thought
to do when he bade good night to them all
at police headquarters less than an hour
gone

chapter xxi

hue and cry

over the seas and under the seas on
the morning of friday the sixth day
of april flashed the news that the congress
of the united states of america had for-
mally declared the existence of a state of war
with the imperial german government
on land to the farthermost settled regions
the word was sent telegraph offices
hummed with it on the broad waters
ship after ship caught the winged tidings
and relayed it on

  the white yacht sea bird caught it from
a belize boat talking to a sister ship plow-
ing eastward by the rosalind bank the
secret german submersible lurking like a
poisonous creature of the deep off matina

cay caught it from an elders  pinsch
freighter out of puerto mono querying a
orleans mail steamer headed for colon
ana from this last the u s gunboat
lincoln crawling up the coast under orders
avidly drank in the news

  she was too far east of matina cay for
the us limited radio to listen in but the
powerful plant at the arraca lumber camp
overheard and passed it and the gunboats
position to the submarine there was a
licking of chops aboard and a disciplined
bustle of preparation this was lieuten-
ant kumpels mission-to hinder in peral-
tas behalf any interference from seaward
now with this long-expected news the
way was made plain for him

  in the camp there was also the bustle of
preparation for immediate action stir-
ring advices had been received during the
night first had come from cortina the
transcript of the washington dispatch
this was relayed to the u and to the sea
bird word was returned that general
peralta would sail instantly for puerto
mono it was a five-hundred-mile run
but the yacht was fast it would make port
in the early morning of saturday the
message was transmitted to the legation
in the meantime intelligence had come from
neiderlein of segovias attempt on the
wireless and later neiderleins anxiety for
kaufman

  colonel heinrich ludolf in command at
the camp did not mention neiderleins
fears to the sea bird he deemed it pre-
mature for at first he did not attach any
great importance to it-herr kaufman had
his reasons for absenting himself never-
theless he flashed back an imperative in-
junction to the secretary-

find him and report

  it was this message that had sent neider-
lein in on his last visit to segovia with
drawn pistol and this message was the
last as events proved that the camp got
through to the legation there was no
response to repeated calls after this col-
onel ludolf understood that something
calamitous had befallen at the other end
and now alarm for herr kaufmans safety
fell upon him yet he refrained from
communicating with the yacht

  the thought in his mind was too incredi-
ble to be seriously entertained and even
could this incredible thing have happened
io

adventure

the imperial envoy would wish he knew the
coup to be carried out to stop it now
would create doubt and suspicion in pej
tas followers it might in truth result
in an irretrievable fiasco so he let the
yacht come on

  but as the hours passed without further
word from the legation what at first had
seemed unthinkable took on the guise of
probability and finally conviction ludolf
summoned to him sub-lieutenant karl
hecht told him of the purloined dispatch
of the change in peraltas plans and of
neiderleins misgivings concerning kauf-
man he added

  it is possible that his excellency has
been abducted i base it on obvious rea-
sons-it would confound the supporters
of the revolution very well we will
nullify it you are to go to cortina on the
morning train pick four men to accom-
pany you learn from herr neiderlein
what has been done he will have made
demands on the zanhorian government
but the government will know nothing-
of course so if the whereabouts of his
excellency has not been discovered dis-
cover it find him stop at nothing
herr kaufman must be back when i enter
the city tomorrow he is the kaisers
deputy

in cortina a late edition of
la cronica came out with the news
from washington in twelve-point
type to make the most of brevity as
the action of congress had been discounted
in advance by the presidents message it
caused but small excitement it was dis-
cussed mildly at breakfast-tables and in
business offices and then dismissed peo-
ple went about their affairs in the usual
leisurely way on the surface life in cor-
tina was rippled only by the stones of in-
dividual desires cast into the tranquil
waters the events of the night were as a
sealed book to the commonalty

  but in officialdom it was different mat-
ters of import occupied it-quietly cooly
yet none the less intensely president
hurango sat in secret council in the rose
room of the executive mansion with his
secretary of state his secretary of war and
the state superintendent of police present
by request was the american minister
in the presidents hands was definite in-
formation of the revolutionary movement-

the arranged day for peraltas landing the
strength of his immediate personnel and
the aid he counted on in the province of
puerto mono and in the provinces of
boaca espero and cortina

  furthermore president hurango even
had in his possession on this day written
down in general peraltas own scrawling
script the names of the chief revolutionists
in the state with the posts promised them
under the new government it was an
invaluable paper most unexpectedly de-
livered to him indeed it was the prime
reason for the meeting secret service
agents were on their way to the provinces
to make arrests

  in the capital arrests would not be made
until late in the day this delay was for
the purpose of allowing the report of herr
kaufmans disappearance to seep privily
into the ears of the conspirators to first
dismay them disorganize and sow distrust
among them would the more readily bring
confession when they were taken into
custody then would be the time to re-
turn herr kaufman meanwhile all ave-
nues of exit from the city were guarded

  that the desired intelligence was already
in process of dissemination was indicated
by a report to the council from the assistant
secretary of state over the presidents pri-
vate telephone to wit herr neiderlein had
called at the department with the opening
of the doors to demand the whereabouts
of the german minister also to demand
an explanation of the forcible detention
overnight of one otto stoll driver of the
ministers car and only just released by
the police herr neiderleins initial de-
mand the assistant secretary had reported
was received with amazed concern but with
a protest against the aspersion cast upon the
government and to his following demand
assurances of an immediate investigation
had been given and redress if warranted

 in brief spanish diplomacy had returned
herr neiderlein to his legation as empty-
handed as he had left it but with unabated
suspicion in his heart and it rankled the
more because he knew the secretary was
laughing in his sleeve at him for not daring
to voice a third demand-punishment of
the man who had invaded the legation the
night before

  while these events were in progress
jimmy perry opened heavy eyes upon the
day he yawned and blinked and then in
answer to the insistent call of his subliminal
self sat up suddenly wide awake he
fished his watch from under his pillow and
looked at the time the result was a vig-
orous pummeling of billy smith into re-
luctant consciousness

  hey you grandson of the seven sleepers
its after nine he cried -shake a leg
there weve got to get out on the street
and learn the news and miss brewer will
be here at twelve

  billy responded querulously

  i was just dreaming wed dyed old pop-
per kaufmans whiskers green and set a
goat loose on em youve spoiled the fun
they dressed and started down for
breakfast in the corridor they paused
and stared mrs isaacs door stood open
and there was not a vestige in the room of
occupancy they crossed over and looked
in there were no personal belongings any-
where everything was in order for the
next comer

  not even a hairpin left said billy
shes found her uncle and gone

  they questioned a criada who was making
up an adjoining room she only knew that
the office had sent up word that no 
was vacated

  im going to find out where she has
gone declared jimmy shes given me
the creeps the last two days that woman
i want to know for sure that ill see no
more of her

  the clerk on duty was not the polyglot
mr gomez he spoke but the language
of his fathers billy interviewed him and
learned that mrs isaacs had left on the
 puerto mono train

  i hope she doesnt miss the boat ex-
claimed jimmy

  huh there are a dozen stops between
here and there billy reminded him
cheer up maybe shell be coming back
it was half-after ten when they came out
from breakfast they decided on a pro-
gram jimmy thought it advisable that
he keep away from the american legation
at this juncture but billy could go without
exciting comment he was to ascertain
from mr lane what developments if any
had occurred in that quarter and then
proceed via the calle cristina to the santa
marta road meantime jimmy acting
on billys suggestion at the farm was to
visit -the banco nacional and show him-
self to morales

  billy went on his mission jimmy waited
a wile then sauntered over to the post-
office ocght pme cards for which he had
no use and lounged along the calle grande
to the bank if secret eyes were on him
he presented the appearance of one without
a care in the world

  he strolled into the bank and spoke to
the teller he had met through segovia on
his first visit to the place the man
changed the bill jimmy tendered and ex-
pressed a burning desire to be of further
service jimmy inquired casually after
senor morales perhaps if he was not
engaged he came to an abrupt pause
morales car was at the door and morales
was entering the bank he was late this
day jimmys glance took swift appraisal
of him he discovered he thought signs
of disquiet in his manner his thick lips
were compressed his beady eyes roved from
point to point they fell on jimmy as
he stepped forward to greet him and the
man stopped dead a baffled expression on
his face-the expression of one who has
accepted a proposition as logically sound
only to find it in the same breath logically
refuted

  she has told him jimmy said to him-
self to morales he said blandly

  how do you do senor i came in to
change a note

  ah yes delighted to see you mr
perry morales stuck out his hand with a
great show of friendliness some one-er
-i heard you were leaving town i am
glad i was misinformed

  i am leaving shortly jimmy said
got to go home and help lick the
germans he mischievously put an en-
trapping question mrs morales-she is
well

  yes-er-no no i am alarmed for
her health quite upset about it and it
has deprived me of the pleasure of enter-
taining you at dinner i fear now-

  pray dont concern yourself for that
jimmy entreated him mrs morales
health is the thing we have to deplore i
was in hopes that she was recovered it
is needless to ask if miss taylor is well
she is the picture of health

the banker did not have himself entirely
in hand on this morning his brows in-
voluntarily contracted he sought to
counteract it with a voluminous smile
miss taylor will die of old age-unless
io

adventure

she meets with an accident he asserted
is there anything i can do for youmr
perry you have onlyvto cbmmand
me

  they were standing precisely at the spot
where they had met morales made no
move toward his private office jimmy was
not the welcome guest of a former day and
he chuckled inwardly as he noted it

   you are kind senor but there is nothing
i could ask of you he answered oh
yes there is he supplemented quickly
under a devils impulse just mention to
miss taylor that you saw me will you
please and that i sent her my most de-
voted regards

  morales little eyes gave him a needle-
like glance it was instantly hidden in an
urbane inclination of his head

   you will come again i trust mr perry
before you leave the city he murmured

  oh most certainly senor i should
grieve to think that we were not to meet
again 

  he returned the others bow and went
out into the street

  now what the deuce made me send
that word to the taylor woman he ques-
tioned of himself irately i gave my
hand away and the old fox caught on to it

qs it was eleven oclock he had
an hour to kill he thought of
dropping in on ortega if there was
news to be learned that was the fountain-
head but he dismissed the notion it
was not in his re to be seen hobnobbing
with the police it occurred to him as he
strolled down the west side of the plaza
that he had come to town on a fools errand
if mary taylor had imparted her sus-
picions to morales it was only a question
of hours when an investigation would be
instituted and his utterly maladroit re-
mark to the banker would hasten it he
would have better stayed at the hacienda
and made ready for whatever came

  jimmy was suddenly rooted to the pave-
ment in frightened surprise winifred
brewer in an automobile was coming
toward him - stopping - speaking low-
voiced and hurriedly it was not in their
plan something had happened

  get in she said where is billy

  at the legation what-

  get in she bade him curtly we
have no time to lose they have been out

to the farm-two men they will be going
back with other men

  he was in beside her but instead of
speeding away she drove slowly up the
calle central and into the calle grande
eastward they might have been riding
for pleasure to all seeming

  we mustnt look as if we are disturbed
talk laugh-anything

   she smiled as she said it

  where are you going he smiled back
at her

  to get billy we shall need him oh
if we have luck and dont have to wait

  things that neither of them could after-
ward recall they chattered gaily about
until they turned into the calle commercio
the luck for which winifred had prayed
was with them billy was coming out of
the door as they approached the legation
he saw them and paused his mouth drop-
ping open his nose twitching spasmodically

  dont ask questions jump in look
pleased jimmy enjoined on him as they
drove up

  they went on easily up the street to-
ward the calle cristina it took them past
the german legation it was a bit of bra-
vado on winifreds part she could have
chosen another way but she was curious
to see if there was any stir at the mission
nothing however was apparent as they
passed

  those chaps back there are sporting
kaiser hogitalls rag today just as if every-
thing was hunky with them advanced
billy from the haze of his bewilderment

  he could not think of anything else to
say and he was forbidden a question

  his remark drew no reply winifred
was turning into the cross street she
pressed the accelerator and the car re-
sponded with quickened life soon they
were on the santa marta road winifred
opened the throttle degree by degree until
they were roaring south at forty miles an
hour the girls hands were steady on the
wheel she felt the road like a veteran
pacemaker

  now tell us exploded jimmy  they
came who

  billy clutched the forward seat and
leaned over to hear

  two germans from the legation
ones name was landeker herr kauf-
man called him by it the other had his
arm in a sling
for the flag



  kaufman-they got to him jimmy
shouted his alarm

  wait winifred answered they
came in a car she glanced at her wrist-
watch it was an hour ago father met
them at the door sam was with him
they were in a furious mood-the germans
-and demanded the instant production of
the minister they knew they said that
he was there father-oh he was fine-
pretended astonishment indignation he
gave them no satisfaction they attempt-
ed to force an entrance and father drew his
revolver he said he would shoot the
first man who came a step farther-and
they knew he would do it sam stood with
his white teeth bared grinning at them like
a wolf and with one of those big pistols in
his hand

  it stopped them then one of them
started running around the house and by
a hap took the east side he cried out
herr kaufmans name kept crying it at
every step with words we could not under-
stand-german we heard herr kaufman
answer from his window-herr landeker
and there was more german but sam
put an end to it he had run back through
the hall when landeker started and he
caught him under the window

  what sam said or did i dont know
but he came around the house with lan-
deker in his hold father motioned the
man with the sling to get into his car and
sam shoved the other in and father and
sam covered them with their pistols until
they were out of sight then i decided to
come on at once and find you i waited
only until i was sure i wouldnt overtake
those two on the road

  i didnt think it would come so soon
jimmy frowned i thought it would be
in the night

  where were you during the time miss
winifred billy asked

  with father she said simply

   of course said jimmy as simply

   she glanced at him and away again at the
ribbon of road before them they were
eating it up soon they would reach the
ravine

  too bad we couldnt get word to ortega
about this maybe he would send us help
commented billy

  the government cant mix in it you
ought to know that retorted jimmy

  any news at the legation

   billy gave a snort of disgust

         whisper his eminency hadnt
shown up yet and if whittaker knew
anything he wouldnt spill it he was sore
at me for playing sick instead of telling
him that id resigned i had a frightful
time screwing five dollars out of him on an
i o u hes so darned tight hell pop and
blow away one of these days

  winifred laughed it did jimmy good
to hear her she was disturbed but not dis-
mayed by the event of the morning brew-
er was right she was not afraid she
was not that kind he told her of enriques
raid on the secret wireless

  ah that was splendid she acclaimed
single-handed against three he is
brave

   they were at the pitch of the ravine and
she eased the car down

  i say broke out billy who had been
scanning the sky to the west theres
nasty weather making over yonder black
as coal ever see it rain in this country
jimmy-a cloud-burst

  ive only been here since monday
jimmy recalled to him

  huh youve got something coming to
you then it can rain hard enough to
drown a mule in one place and two miles
away they are eating dust and its all
over in half an hour

  they splashed through the rivulet at the
bottom of the gorge and went up the other
side two minutes later they were at the
farmhouse door brewer was there to meet
them he stabbed a question at jimmy

   is war declared

  by an overwhelming majority of both
houses

  brewer looked up at the flag over the
door a nebulous smile touched his face

  we will raise it from the house-top
he said let them come and haul it

down

chapter xxii

dead men tell no tales

on this same afternoon of april sixth
el terror the flag and only fighting
ship of the zanhorian navy lay drowsing
at anchor behind the breakwater in the
harbor of puerto mono it had drowsed
there weeks without end except for a semi-
occasional sally into the farther waters for
frugal gun-practise
no

adventure

  admiral miguel terrozas was ashore
he spent indeed most of his timtshore
having nothing to do when afloat but listen
to his rusty anchor-chain grinding in its
hawse-hole ashore there were matters
to talk about matters that of late had been
whispered to him in secret corners by cer-
tain persons and to which he had lent an
attentive ear for he perceived advantage to
his personal renown and fortune in these
confidences

  but on this afternoon admiral terrozas
was receiving light in his darkened under-
standing and the source of it and the man-
ner of it whelmed him in astonishment and
a waxing fear he was seated in the port-
wardens office overlooking the harbor
his companion was a woman-a dark lit-
tle woman in gray with a quiet voice and a
quiet way that somehow conveyed the
effect of a vast authority speaking through
her

  admiral terrozas was made to see that
his personal fortunes lay on the upper side
of the shelf instead of being suspended by a
hair from the lower side he was made to
see that a long and powerful arm was ready
to stretch down from afar to zanhoria and
knock mutinous heads together until the
isthmus should resound with it

  he was made to see the vision of an event-
ual united states of central america found-
ed not in strife but in the concord of mutual
interests and aspirations and incidentally
with a defensive navy that a brilliant sailor
would have profit and pleasure in com-
manding and finally admiral terrozas
was made to see that to go out and intercept
peralta on his approach to the coast would
be a very excellent way to avoid the adobe
wall that waited in cortina for the enemies
of the republic	

  in fine admiral terrozas had been made
to see in sharp relief which side his political
bread was buttered on when he left the
port-wardens office he went immediately
aboard his ship and in half an hour was
steaming for the open sea the sea bird
probably would lay a devious course for
puerto mono out of the regular lane of
traffic also she might put in at a point
above or below the port

  the admiral would patrol the coast in the
hope that good fortune would place the
yacht in his way whether on this day or
the morrow or the day after and as
chance or providence would have it he

laid his course south by east at first when
with equal reason he might have laid it
north by west

  mrs isaacs meanwhile after watching
el terror clear the harbor entertained her-
self at dinner in a retired cafe by the water-
front and prolonged the meal to the ex-
treme limit of gentility for she had a wait
of three hours to endure before her return
train left for the capital

steaming up the coast as el
terror steamed down it came the
gunboat lincoln she was off pun-
ta gorda and inshore in the territorial
waters of zanhoria less than four hours
lay between her and puerto mono she
would drop anchor at ten if all went well
one bell in the second dog-watch had struck
the sea was bland as a moorland pond

  submarine on the starboard beam sir
just emerging distance about four thou-
sand yards called the lookout on the
heels of this came another call steamer on
the port bow sir rounding the point a
gunboat

  the lincoln was agasp with astonish-
ment a submarine in these waters un-
less-it might be-an american boat

  a four-inch explosive shell screaming
through the lincolns rigging settled the
question it burst a hundred yards away
the general alarm and torpedo defense
bells rang out men jumped to their
stations the range-finders sent in their
curt orders and the forward guns spoke

  the u worked in nearer shelling as she
came but without a hit it was not afraid
of this old slow-footed tub with guns no
greater than its own it could run circles
around her and this other old tub poking
out from the point-blundering in where
she had no business-would make off when
she saw what was up terrozas knew
where his interests lay

  great spouts of water rose about the
lincoln from the falling shells and around
the u each was getting the range and
it was nip and tuck as to which would score
the first hit if the lincoln it would be
all over with the enemy if the u it depend-
ed on where the shot struck

  then from the boiling sea about the sub-
marine a white streak darted forth with
tremendous velocity it circled a little
to allow for the pitiful speed of the gunboat
but the submarine had not taken into
for the flag

iii

account the gunboats zigzag and with a
venomous zip the torpedo whizzed by
twenty yards ahead of the mark

  the lincolns wireless was signaling the
other gunboat the quarter-deck had
made her out but could not understand her
tactics she had sheered off on a course
that would bring her well to the north of
the submarine these were neutral waters
was the zanhorian going to make no pro-
test

  terrozas kept his silent course the u
thought it understood him-he was simply
going to quit the scene and let his friends
finish their work unhindered his action
could bear no other interpretation but
the old fool was taking a stupid risk he
might get a stray shot in his vitals from the
american

  a shell from the u found the lincoln at
last it plumped into her engine-room
killing two men but did not explode it
smashed in the intermediate cylinder-head
however and the boat lay crippled on the
water but her guns still spoke and the
submarine kept her distance a shot had
grazed its conning-tower and carried a man
along with it

  and then something happened and it was
a miracle-no less

  el terror was off the beam of the u now
the latter was preparing to launch a second
torpedo-with long odds in its favor this
time-when the zanhorian gunboat let
loose its entire starboard battery of three-
pounders at the german and it was a
hit-that was the miracle of it-a hit the
first time by a gun-crew that scarccly
knew the smell of powder the submarine
rolled over and went down with only a
floating patch of stinking oil to mark where
she had been

  terrozas left the few men yet alive
struggling in the water and wore around to
go to the lincolns aid he had proved that
he knew which side his bread was buttered
on and besides dead germans tell no tales

chapter xxiii

unveiled

tnrique stayed at home on friday
 as he had promised for the message
that was to come from mary he was up
at ten oclock and after a breakfast he had
no relish for and a listless half-hour with

the mor ing paper he dawdled about the
house in miserable suspense

  don luis valera had gone away very
early the old butler informed enrique in
answer to a note brought by a messenger
who would deliver it into no hands other
than the secretarys own enrique won-
dered a little what such an imperative sum-
mons foretold was the german legation
making trouble well let don luis at-
tend to it he had done his part and had a
broken head to show for it

  since the quarrel with his uncle enrique
had exchanged with him only the perfunc-
tory civilities demanded in the presence of
the servants they had dined together the
night before in cold silence enrique had
not mentioned his purposed attack on the
wireless if he failed it would only be
what don luis would have expected of him
and if he succeeded don luis would have
small praise for him he had called him a
fool-let him remain in that belief

  the boy did not know that his uncle
apprized by ortega of the dangerous task
he had set for him had lain awake listening
for his home-coming nor could he know
that before leaving the house that morning
don luis had softly looked in on him as he
slept to reassure himself of his safety he
moped about from room to room counting
the time and chewing the cud of bitter re-
flection his uncle-jimmy-ortega-were
all in league against mary they per-
sisted in reading her falsely in manufactur-
ing a character for her that was as far from
truth as hell from heaven

  but as he recurred to the incident in the
calle dolores he was compelled to acknowl-
edge that it looked equivocal it was part
of an event to which as yet he did not hold
the key mary had promised to supply it
but the day was wearing on and there was
no word from her and it was a thing that
demanded explanation a woman could
not hold silence in the face of the extraordi-
nary situation in which she was found by the
man who loved her she would hasten to
give a reason that should be at once sound
and satisfactory why did mary delay

  enriques forehead gathered into heavy
furrows he had told mary that he would
not ask an explanation would she rest on
this but no of her own accord she had
said she would send for him he was to
stay at home until he heard well he was
staying and he did not hear why it


adventure

was two oclock surely she mustmow the
agony of his waiting

  he tried in a dozen ways to ease the pass-
age of the hours to create for himself an
atmosphere of unconcern of assured confi-
dence in his ultimate deliverance from the
suspense in which he was prisoned all his
devices failed-nothing mattered but this
primal passion that was devouring him at
last he could endure the ache of it no
longer it was striking three six hours
he had waited in a torture of expectancy
he would put an end to it

  he went to the telephone in the library
and called up morales house they were
an eternity in answering but at length a
womans palpitant voice came to him on the
wire it was not marys it was the senora
morales perhaps or a maids

  i would like to speak please with miss
taylor he requested say it is senor
segovia

  there was a pause then the voice re-
plied-

  miss taylor is not here senor

  she has gone out

  yes senor

 when

  hours ago-ten oclock or a little be-
fore it may have been

may i ask when you expect her back
i can not say i do not know senor
enrique hung up the receiver he sat
for a long time gazing at the instrument as
though it might if it would give answer to
the questions that battered at his mind

  she told me to wait-and she kissed me
-she kissed me he repeated over and
over in a dull monotone

  he got up and walked the floor walked it
back and forth from side to side with
dragging feet and it was on him in this
endless chain of steps that don luis en-
tered home for a brief hour in a day that
would merge into another before he would
see repose he took in the young mans
neglige attire and his drawn face

  you have not been out today he asked
  no sir enrique answered briefly

  he had left off his walk

  you were hurt last night senor ortega
tells me are you in pain

  a bruise only it does not inconveni-
ence me

  don luis looked at him straightly his
eyes cynical and coldly disapproving he
said slowly

  the man mateo has been disciplined
he slept at his post he did not see the
other woman who left the house possibly
miss taylor mentioned her to yoil

  it was don luis way of introducing a
subject he intended to dispose of finally
but to segovia it came as a ray of light
athwart the gloom that filled him it was a
woman mary had gone to see his faith in
her was born again he returned his
uncles gaze scornfully defiant

  so they set a watch on her and it
failed why sir this is notable news
two women meet for a purpose of their
own what the purpose one would think
was strictly their affair but it seems not
a watch is set on them they are dogged
by a sneaking spy one goes away unseen
and the other whom i chanced to meet is
ill and i escort her home a mystery
truly

ijgp don luis studied him an intense
wi moment hevvasconsideringwhether
msm he should say the thing that was in
his mind he decided to defer it for the
present the boy was in the grip of an
infatuation that was blinding him even to
his honor it might be he would open his
eyes first

  you have not answered me he said
but it does not matter miss taylor did
not mention the woman to you she did
not tell you what happened to her in that
house engaged solely for the purpose of
receiving her on that night she had ex-
cellent reasons for not doing so she
wished to keep her hold on you and to tell
you would have destroyed it perhaps
there is no counting on what a man will
do in your evil case

  sir enriques face flushed darkly
he made a- threatening step toward his
uncle and checked himself you take ad-
vantage your excellency of my obligations
to you

  you still have faith in this woman after
what you saw last night-after what mateo
saw and the man in the car with you

  don luis thwacked him with the inter-
rogatory as with a stick enrique flinched
under it

  until i have a better reason to forego
it he returned sullenly

  let us begin then the secretary
handed him a slip of paper read it it
is the reply to a question asked by the
for the flag

ii

american minister of the north american
gazelle it would have been unnecessary
to ask it today with what we know

  the cablegram fluttered from enriques
hand to the floor he made no attempt to
recover it but stood staring at it benumbed
and voiceless it read

unknown to us we have no traveling contributors

  don luis was merciless

well do you still believe hedemanded
are you the one sage in a rabble of fools
enrique did not reply to him he turned
to the window and he stood there gazing
unseeingly into the street

  a judas kiss he cried from his riven
soulit was a judas kiss she gave me
his uncle watched him a space and spoke
again

  her real name is ella prietz she is of
the german intelligence office a spy
but she was outwitted at the last and it
was you who found her defeated and dis-
comfited and coddled her to her home
enrique tell me did she cajole from you
our secret plans not that it matters now
but-

  enrique wheeled about his eyes were
blazing

  i am a fool but not a traitor senor don
luis maria santiago de valera

  the older mans expression softened
yes that i could not believe he mur-
mured and to enrique his tone gentle
and persuasive sit down my boy i will
tell you what has passed since the early
hours of the day zanhoria has abandoned
her neutrality the call to action has come
but first i will say that the president is
highly pleased with your performance at the
german legation he has a captains com-
mission for you and i-

  enrique made a violently impatient ges-
ture

  where is she now he rasped did
they let her get away

  she is in senor ortegas charge she was
arrested as she was taking the arraca train
at two oclock she was at the legation
until then

  ha it is plain neiderlein was send-
ing her to the camp to warn them of kauf-
mans disappearance

  much more than that said don luis
gravely in the house in dolores street
she was inveigled into giving information
of general peraltas plans she believed



she was talking to a confederate spy but
there was one thing she held back it was
peraltas written list of the conspirators
and intended only for herr kaufmans eye
that was taken from her with other papers
a glass of wine-and it was done all the
papers were in mr lanes hands in half an
hour afterward

  i understand now enriques face re-
flected the mocking thoughts that besieged
him but this other woman who is she
where did she come from

  senor valera smiled faintly it indexed
his complacency with the turn of events

  she is known as a mrs rebecca isaacs
of new york she is in reality a united
states secret service agent and she was sent
to jamaica to run down the rumor of pe-
raltas proposed coup women succeed
better than men in these things oftentimes
mrs isaacs established the truth of the
rumor and she went further she gained her
way into peraltas confidence how one
can only imagine-but her german is
fluent and her spanish and her plainness
disarms any thought of feminine intrigue

  at all events she learned many things
and among them that this miss prietz was
the bearer of an important document to
herr kaufman mrs isaacs managed to
get a strong letter from peralta to morales
and she came on to cortina with the pre-
text of helping to forward the uprising
she called immediately at the german lega-
tion as a confidential agent of peralta and
it was she who conveyed the stolen dispatch
from morales to herr kaufman yesterday
morning morales asked her to be his mes-
senger

  enrique looked his astonishment

  she played into their hands

  my dear boy she knew morales would
tell miss prietz it strengthened the posi-
tion mrs isaacs was planning to assume
with the woman and herr kaufman
would have had from morales a precis of
the note in any event he added all
of the conspirators will be arrested within
the hour

  jimmy perry can let kaufman go now
remarked enrique in a heavy voice

  he was thinking of what jimmy would
say when he should be acquainted with
these facts

  we shall send word word to him to-
night said don luis perhaps you will
be the one to go
ii

adventure

  no i-i would rather not protested
the young man vehemently send some
one else i must decline i have some-
thing that will engage me here in cortina
his uncle did not combat him for he fan-
cied he understood his objection

  oh as you choose my boy he agreed
good-humoredly senor ortega can find
another messenger

  enrique made him a preoccupied gesture
his gaze was remote-absorbed black and
deadly don luis saw only that his nephew
was cured of his passion and he went out
well contented with the interview

chapter xxiv

a semi-understanding

they were busy at the hacienda the
germans might return at any time
tia matilde in the outdoor kitchen was
boiling eggs and a great ham in anticipa-
tion of a possible siege that would preclude
the use of the stove

  tio diego was getting a short ladder from
the stable to be set up in the house under
the skylight he was going about this
business with many a shake of his gray poll
in fearful speculation on what these extraor-
dinary events in which he was enmeshed
portended

  in the dining-room winifred was setting
out a lunch and marshaling her stores of
tinned goods in the pantry ready to hand
sam was helping her with a watchful eye
on the open slide of herr kaufmans door
across the hall jimmy was in there having
been summoned by the prisoner for a parley

  brewer and billy had gone to the woods
in search of a sapling that would answer
for a flagstaff brewer was curiously bent
on this project before the boys return
from cortina he had hunted up some iron
braces to secure the pole to the coaming
of the skylight the house was tiled and
the coaming offered the only vantage-point
for his purpose a ladder from the inside
would give safe access to it the two
were coming back now

  we will have to hurry sir billy was
saying those clouds over there are get-
ting a gait on

  it wont take us long brewer answered
ten minutes will do

  but the halyards it will take time to
rig the pole

  we wont need halyards we are going
to nail our colors to the mast

  billy glanced at him the look in the
mans face sent a tingle up his spine

  i see he said softly

  they did not speak again until they were
in the house

  if we had a pair of glasses we might pick
out something up there suggested billy
when they had taken the flag down from
over the front door and were preparing
to mount the ladder we might get a good
look up the santa marta road

  we might agreed brewer

  he stepped into his room and returned
with a binocular field-glass the hall was
high-studded and the ladder did not reach
the ceiling by three feet it was an ancient
and shaky affair diego steadied it and
from the top rung they were able to draw
themselves up by the skylight casing on to
the roof diego passed the pole to them
and they fell to at their work

  jimmy came out from his talk with kauf-
man he spied winifred in the dining-
room and stopped at the door she was
fetching something from the pantry to the
table with an eager gesture she bade him
enter

  what did he have to say she queried
jimmy glanced around kaufmans eyes
were at the slide he was listening jimmy
calmly closed the door on him

  he said a lot of things he replied i
reckon you wouldnt care to hear some of
them they were not exactly drawing-
room remarks

  the girl placed the dish she held on a
tray on which were other dishes she called
sam from the pantry

  take it in to herr kaufman she
directed she added austerely-

  if he shrugs at it bring it immediately
away as you did this morning

  sam grinned knowingly and departed
with the tray jimmys blue eyes glinted

  kaufman was unmannerly about it this
morning he asked

  she nodded

  but tell me what he said why did he
send for you

  boiled down it was to demand his in-
stant release under penalty of violence
from the legation staff

  he meant that we would be attacked
yes war to the knife you know-
blood and iron that sort of thing
for the flag	

  you smile you dont take it seri-
ously she taxed him

  yes i do but one might as well smile
as cry and its not so disfiguring to the
features

  she smiled herself now

  well what did you say to him
nothing much i reminded him that
as he had set the example of violating the
neutrahty laws we felt at liberty to follow
in his distinguished footsteps and i inti-
mated that we were very well prepared to
extend a warm reception to any of his
friends who might consider it advisable to
come for him

  is that all as he paused

  the sum of it kaufman made a com-
ment in german when i was leaving i
dont know german so i decided to accept
it as the expression of a profound interest
in my hereafter and bowed myself
away

  a small laugh escaped winifred-his
manner was so entirely at variance with the
gravity of the situation

  i like you that way he put forth
quickly may i say it it makes me
feel that we are getting to be friends not
just companions in a cause

  the smile left her face her dark eyes
regarded him with a melancholy that moved
him to a great compassion for he guessed
the origin

  i think i answered that the other day
she said her voice low wont you please
let it rest that way

  but he was not content to do this until
he was assured that her objections were not
based on grounds other than those he
guessed he discovered an urge in him to
put the issue to the test

       you are not fair to me he told
her in warm protest i am not
-jlkj lightly asking for your friendship
and at this time when-when things may
happen-i wouldnt intrude the question
if it did not mean a great deal to me

  he reddened with the avowal and went
on blundering sadly in his confusion

  i-i havent had much to do with girls
only in a sort of passing way-at college-
places like that-just funning with them
perhaps im not the kind to win a girls
friendship though i havent thought about
that-not till now you see ive been
busy with other things a lot-in fathers

office for one thing getting the hang of the

business and-

  oh dont go on dont winifred
stopped him with a little outfiinging of her
hands it is not that-not you any
girl would want you for a friend only i-
i must deny myself your friendship i can
not reach up to it i-i am not worthy
of it

  she bowed her head standing before him
in humble abasement his heart con-
tracted with the pity of it

  i will not believe that he disputed
fiercely no one can make me believe
it and least of all yourself some circum-
stance some condition you were powerless
to prevent has been forced on you i do
not ask what it is i do not care what it is
and whatever it is it could not affect my
regard for you a man knows when he
stands in the presence of goodness and
i know it now some one is coming will
you take me as your very faithful friend-
winifred

  his eyes were insistent upon her in
answer-slowly falteringly-her hand rose
from her side and went out to his and
yet she did not wholly yield she cried
out

  ah you make me how can i refuse
but it is only until we are done here with
what we have to do-only until then after-
ward it must end

  it was sam coming back from kaufman
that jimmy had heard the interruption
did not irk him he was well satisfied to
let his reply to winifred wait for in truth
there was no reply ready to his tongue
it was only a semi-understanding he had
achieved but it was something after-
ward it was yet to come and hope lives
in the tomorrow

  sams white teeth showed in the ebon
setting of his face as he entered the dining-
room the tray was not in evidence

  mister coughem aint so rambunctious
bout his vittels dis time miss winny he
announced

  oh he has changed his mind since morn-
ing has he sam

  yesm i reckon he beginnin ter feel
kinder sharp-set long bout now but he
play off fusttlat he aint got no intres in
wat ise a-bringin him i make des as

miss winny but he dont have nuffin
mo ter say cept in dat outerlandish lingo
he make talk wif ter himsef an so i come
erway an leave him whar he is

  the room while sam was speaking had
taken on a strange livid hue jimmy went
to a window and looked out the storm
billy had prophesied was about to break
gusts of scorching air blew in on him in
the yard old tia matilde was hurriedly
stripping a clothes-line of certain household
linens she had washed in the early hours of
the day a blinding flash of lightning sent
jimmy staggering back from the window

  im not fond of fireworks he said with
a forced smile not that kind and
coming on top of that quake last night it
makes me skittish hadnt we better see
to the windows on the west

  yes close these in here please i
will look after the others sam go out and
dose the shutters on this side

  winifred sped away and sam hastened
off on his mission jimmy saw to the win-
dows in the dining-room and went out
into the hall tio diego was steadying
the ladder for billy who was scrambling
down without any nice regard to his foot-
ing he was panicky and confessed it

  that last flash gosh i could feel it
to my boots he gulped you dont smell
any brimstone about me do you

  father why doesnt he come down
it is raining great sheets in the valley we
will get it in another minute

  it was winifred she had run out of
the last west room and was anxiously ques-
tioning billy

  he stopped to have another look with
the glass you can see the road for miles
up there wed furled the flag-be whipped
to pieces if we hadnt-when that flash
came i didnt wait to say good-by but
mr brewer just stood there looking up the
road like a boy watching for the circus
say miss winifred your father is a cool
hand all right the kind to have

  in the crepuscular light bred by the

onrushing tempest jimmy could not see

the cross-fire of emotions pictured in the
girls face but he could fancy how they
battled there-pride and pain and with
victory aloof from either could brewer
ever give back that which he had taken
from her

  the man was coming in from the roof
the binocular swung from a strap about his
neck he paused on the upper rounds of
the ladder to lower the wings of the sky-
light and barely in time a flying wave of
water dashed in on him and sprayed those
below brewer was drenched to the skin
but he finished his work then he came
down

the storm swooped bellowing about
the rock-built house the rain
drove by in solid walls and the
darkness of night was in the hall diego
crossed himself and muttered what he
could remember of his prayers none of
them gave a thought to kaufman in his
solitary confinement a few feet away
brewer shouted above the turmoil to sam
light the lamp let us see what we
are about here

  but jimmy was already at the lamp and
presently the enfolding gloom was relieved
winifreds hand lay upon her fathers arm
and she was urging him to his room

  you must change your clothes she
said putting her mouth close to his ear to
make him hear you will take cold

  her solicitude warm and pressing was
new to him his pale face flushed under
it and with a sort of timidness that brought
a kindred flush to his daughters cheek he
laid his hand on hers and kept it there
he bent his head to her

  i am all right he told her it wont
hurt me to wait and ive something to say
when i can

  he unslung the glasses and dropped them
in a chair

  they stood all of them silently listening
to the uproar without after a little the
first fury of it abated it grew lighter
the thunder rolled away into the distance
the wind fell the rain came down no
longer in bucketfuls but in measured lenity
in half an hour the sun would be smiling on
the water-swept earth

  i wanted to tell you brewer said when
at last he could make himself heard in an
ordinary tone that my glass discovered
an open car coming from cortina it was
filled with men

  the germans ejaculated jimmy
how far off was it

  i should say about three miles they
may not be the germans but we wont be
caught napping at any rate we are ready
for them

  theyll have a merry time getting over
here derided billy the ravine is a rag-
ing river by this we are not getting the
full force of this rain it started in the low-
land it will be hours before they can
cross if they havent turned back what
do you say tio this isnt the first time
youve seen a cloudburst here

  he addressed the old man in spanish
they talked at some length and jimmy
noticed that billy was frowning and his
nose twitching fitfully he cut tio diego
off with a curt gesture and spoke to
brewer

  he says theres a foot-bridge down the
ravine about a mile where it turns south
its rocky there and high and narrow
thats what piles the water up so when
it rains the indians built the bridge years
ago diego says it was pretty shaky the
last time he saw it but you could get
across

  if they know about it jimmy inter-
jected perhaps they dont

  i think said brewer quietly we had

better go on the supposition that they do
know about it anyway they are likely
to explore the ravine before giving up

  in this rain objected jimmy

  billy jeered at him

  rain a german isnt afraid of water
on the outside of him its on the inside he
kicks at

  but the car what will they do with

it

  run it in the bushes off the road until
they are ready to go back

  brewer smiled in a set stem way
perhaps he remarked they wont go
back at least not with kaufman sam
go around the house and close every shut-
ter we wont have time for it if they try
to rush us and wed better have lunch
right away winny ill be with you in
five minutes

  he drew his arm from the girls hold on
it very gently and went into his room

  my heavenly home exclaimed billy
as the door shut if i was an insurance
agent id hate to have popper kaufman
for a risk not if he started to cut up with
mr brewer about

  he did not laugh he was in sober ear-
nest jimmys eyes sought winifreds but
there was a faraway look in hers that did
not take him in she murmured some-
thing about seeing tia matilde and slipped
away down the hall

to be concluded
me and muley bowles and
chuck warner are putting
a saddle on a colt in the cross
j corral when telescope tol-
liver enters the precincts of said ranch and
we gets our first glimpse of archibald ames

  archibald occupies a seat on the buck-
board with telescope and they soon comes
over and climbs on top of the corral fence
archibalds name fits him-in a way the
length of his first name indicates his girth
and his last name his height hes one of
them persons who youd never invite to set
down cause he dont seem to require no
such posture

  it takes him quite a long time to nego-
tiate the top-pole of the corral and when he
does get up there he has to balance-his
feet wont reach the next pole hes wear-
ing them dinky little pants with the seat
of a shoplifter and the knees of lord
fauntleroy his calves perspire in shiny
leggings and for a hat he wears a libel on
the name of stetson

  muley gives him a passing glance yanks
up another notch on the cinch and grunts-
whatll we do with it

  love it to death or render it out grunts
chuck looks to me like one of them
playthings for kids that yuh cant tip over
and make it stay down lets give this
colt a chance to breathe while we peers a
little closer at this attraction

  we ambles over and looks up at the
critters soles

  mister ames orates telescope im
obliged to make yuh used to muley bowles

hes the sylph-like critter in woolly chaps
that one with the sad horse-faced features
is chuck warner the anti-george wash-
ington of yaller rock county and the
other person down there is henry peck
theyre all harmless

  bunch this is mister archibald ames
who is to be with us for a spell

  im pleased to meet yuh smiles archie

  you ought to be agrees muley it
aint often that we shows this much interest
in a stranger what seems to bring yuh
hither

  i brung him states telescope mis-
ter ames is looking for local color sabe

  whats he done and is he wanted by
federal state or county asks chuck
serious-like wiggling his ears

  chuck can wiggle his ears just like a
mule

  done what grunts telescope chuck
you boob dont yuh know what local
color is

  ill bite grins chuck go ahead and
spring it telescope

   telescope clears his throat rolls a cigaret
and glares at chuck who glares right back
and wiggles his ears

  look at them ears applauds archi-
bald id love to get a close-up of them

  mister reproves chuck it aint
seemly that a stranger should set on top
of a corral and make remarks about the
physical failings of a native son keep on
at the pace youve started and that spell
that telescope spoke about can be spelled
in four letters g-o-n-e sabe


dough or dynamite		

  you got a lot to say about it now aint
yuh reproves telescope you aint
nothing around here but a forty-dollar
puncher you got a lot of chance to tell
visitors where to head in come on mister
ames and well go up and see the man
what owns this ranch and aint no more
sense than to pay forty dollars to a runt
like that

  they climbs down and goes up to the
ranch-house

 haw haw haw whoops muley
shaking every ounce of his two hundred and
forty pounds of bone and lard haw haw
 come on mister ames and we go up to
see the man-haw haw haw you will
tell folks where to head in at will yuh
muley is a poet there might a been
as good rhymers as him once upon a time
but theyre all dead and departed muley
is the he-buzzard of the flock right now he
hangs on to the side of the corral and wipes
the tears out of his eyes

  gosh he snorts telescope sure
showed his breeding chuck yuh could
tell hes been well raised sticks his chin
up in the air like a grouse with a goiter
and proclaims come on with me mister
ames haw haw haw

  some day im going to reach up and
hang my fist on his jaw proclaims chuck

  you better catch him in bed or carry a
ladder with yuh says i you got ambi-
tion chuck but your height aint noways
adequate

  a little later old man whittaker who
owns the cross j outfitrcomes out with
archibald and them two goes back to town
in the buckboard telescope comes down to
the bunk-house and sets down in our
midst

  chuck gives him a mean look and goes
on playing solitaire telescope admires
himself in our cracked shaving-mirror

  better fix your features in your mind
telescope cause youre sure going to need
a pattern after chuck gets through with
yuh laughs muley

  that banty little ear-wiggler snorts
telescope i got a feeling that i aint
going to punch cows much longer

  dead men punch no cows states
chuck your perceptions are getting
clearer

  where do yuh feel bad telescope i
asks tell papa where it hurts

  aw - telescope turns from the

mirror and glares at us im glad im
going to get away from you half-wits
has the old man been kicking on yuh
wasting so much time over at the bowers
ranch holding hands with miss amy or
has that tumble-bug yuh had down to the
corral been whispering sweet nothings in
your ear asks chuck

you leave miss bowers name
out of itl snaps telescope mis-
ter ames is a moving-picture man
and i may cease punching the festive cow
to play hero parts for him me and him
have had quite some conversation regarding
same and he assures me that ive got the
physique and features for a lead

  you got the physique and features for a
funeral if yuh dont quit wearing my red
tie says i thats right-throw it on
the floor if yuh wants to make a hit
with folks why dont yuh buy some clothes
of your own

  tell us all about it little one begs muley
resting his fat chin on hi hands and squint-
ing at telescope

     sing us a song of a locoed man

      who got stuck on your face and shape-

     a form that was built by accident

       and the face of a jungle ape

     sing us a song of a keeper bold

      who went sound asleep one day

     a keeper whos going to show up soon

       and lead little archie away

  ill tell yuh nothing yelps telescope
you fellers are just plumb ignorant
aint it true nods chuck id take
a job too if i was begged

  you snorts telescope haw haw
haw mister ames told me that if he wanted
something for the public to laugh at hed
sure hire you no chuckie this is a
moving picture-not a sideshow

  heres the idea continues telescope
mister ames wants something real he

wants real punchers and-

  ninety-eight cents in chicago nods
chuck i seen in a mail-order catalog

where yuh could get good ones for-

  he wants a real hold-up states tele-
scope he wants a stage held up and he
dont want no fake sabe somehow hes
got the idea that i could do it artistic-
like

  your experience will help yuh out
nods chuck there was a hold-up over
in mexican canon once and the feller-


adventure

  sufficient chuck snorts muley and
chuck winks at me

  well of course it wasnt done by one
man murmurs chuck one of the posse
shot the horns off a animile and made a
muley correct me if i appear to be wrong
you stand corrected states muley
desist from historical romance or ill re-
member one summer afternoon down in
cottonwood when a certain man went into

a bank and-

  i accepts the correction admits chuck
playing a red queen on a red king and tele-
scope continues

  you fellers keep this under your hats
sabe along about wednesday afternoon
im going to hold up the stage from pipe-
rock of course after its over ill return
everything and all the while this picture
will be taken he wants to advertise it
as a real hold-up and she will be all that
going south as she drags out of hell
gate crossing orates chuck

  thats the designated place grins tele-
scope you must a been studying the
situation chuck

  suppose somebody takes a shot at yuh
i suggests art miller aint no suckling
infant and if theres a shipment from the
golden cross aboard there might be a
guard

  yuh never can tell about them ship-
ments agrees chuck ive tried several
times to find out

 no wonder yuh know a good place
laughs telescope never mind there
aint going to be no shooting ill have em
buffaloed my shells will all be blanks
if i makes good in this i cinches a job with
archibald ames and its good-by to the
cross j no more will mister tolliver ride
the hills and smell of burnt hair and corrals
poor eh ill be eating breakfast in bed
while chuck warner is out chopping holes
in the ice so the doggies can drink

  a little more such talk and yuh wont
have to be a actor to get breakfast in bed
states chuck keep it up and youll
have all your meals in bed if you wants
to hear me say what i think about you being
a actor you got to come outside i got too
much respect for the bunk-house to express
myself here

  this day being monday we has to put
up with that kind of conversation until
tuesday afternooon when chuck opines
that hes going up to piperock chuck

cant stand prosperity and tuesday is pay-
day hes a roulette fiend and he runs into
bad luck every time he bucks a wheel in
paradise so he wearies his bronc with
monthly trips to piperock once he won
eight dollars up there it cost him forty
but he never figured that side of the
ledger

  anyway we wishes him many happy re-
turns of the day and he lopes away as
he forks his bronc he grins at telescope and
says

  to be a good actor yuh got to imagine
youre the party youre imitating just
think youre slippery silverton telescope
hes a good pattern to go by sabe
slippery sure aint no imitation hes
had the montana officers buffaloed for so
long that they think hes more than one
man the accumulated rewards for him
look like the weekly clean-up at the u s
mint

  me and muley wishes to see the pro-
ceedings so we rides down to paradise
the next day with telescope and has con-
verse with archibald ames he squints
at the sky and shakes his head

  i doubt it says he too cloudy
yuh cant get snappy stuff in atmosphere
like this and there cant be no retake
well let her go until tomorrow i may
set up after a while and get some character
stuff lots of local color aroimd here
good characters and the background is
great know what i mean

  perfectly says i sheep-herders and
so forth

  telescope opines that old man bowers
ranch is calling him so a little later on he
rides away me and muley horns into a
poker game and about an hour later archi-
bald ames invades the place and leans
against the bar mike pelly leaves the
table to serve him but archie aint dry
he asks a question-

  can vou tell me where i can get some
raw beef

  he turns to us and we sees the most
wonderful black eye yuh ever seen

  holy henhawks i snorts what yuh
been doing

  ill tell yuh snorts doughgod smith
from the doorway hes been exhibiting
his danged ignorance he opines to get a
picture of a shepherd and he picked me
doughgod aint no shepherd i explains
to archie
dough or dynamite	

  this is a -of a time to tell me

wails archie and he goes across the street
to a restaurant

  the next we sees of him hes taking a
picture of a rackful of broncs and then he
goes over and photygrafts a greaser kid and
a dog

      me and muley donates as much
as we can to mikes game and then
quits we wanders down to art
millers barn and sets down in the sun
we havent been there long when we sees
the stage drive up to the depot they
dumps some stuff off and then drives down
to the bam beside art is old man war-
ners son chuck and when he sees us he
grins all over his homely face art sees us
and they both whoops

  any time yuh dont think it was yuh
got another think coming whoops chuck
hanging on to a front wheel haw haw
haw left the danged fool up a-haw
haw haw-tree

  art leans against one of his wheelers and
the tears runs out of his eyes

  some-haw haw haw-picture gar-
gles art i aint laughed so much in my
whole life

  him and chuck looks at each other and
busts out laughing again

  what seems to be tickling yuh asks
muley is it a secret

  oh glory gasps chuck listen you
fellers thats going to be some picture
telescope held up that stage but nobody
will ever see that picture haw haw
haw we drives out of the crossing and
he stops us just like a regular bandit of
course we know hes got blanks in his gun
but we elevates our hands to make the play
good hes got a sack over his head so
yuh cant see his face and i got a false mus-
tache on so he wont know me i made it
myself

  well we kicks the express box off and
sudden-like goes for our guns he must
a been dreaming to let us get the drop
thataway we makes him throw his gun
in the river haw haw haw

  then we makes him put the box back
on the stage whoops art after he gets
that done we makes him walk down to the
river and get a big rock then we marches
him back and makes him put it on the empty

boot he made ten trips after boulders
then we makes him dance a while crawl
all the way around the outfit on his hands
and knees and to finish up we made him
climb up an old cottonwood snag and hes
there when we drives out of sight with our
thumbs at our noses at him haw haw
wait till i see telescope promises
chuck weak-like

  haw says muley hed admire to
hear it chuck he was here until a while
ago and went over to bowers

so we postponed taking that picture

   art and chuck looks foolish-like at each
other and then at us

   well says chuck i dont sabe this
thats the trouble with you chuck
opines muley art dont have much sabe
either i reckon you fellers had about ten
thousand easy dollars crawling around your
stage on its hands and knees and jus to
show your contempt for it yuh rode away
with your thumbs at your nose and your
fingers wiggling at it

   sus-slippery silverton stutters chuck
that sure was slippery aint we the
dangdest fools on earth

  by a majority of two agrees muley
telescope will be delighted

  my - gasps art slippery sil-
verton i think that box had a shipment
from the golden cross what a chance i
took

   all the way from piperock says i but
i dont think chuck got it-he was beyond

words

  me and muley went up and had a drink
and muley laughs so hard that he forgot
to pay for it we meets art a little later
on but there aint much fun joshing him

about it

   its on chuck says he he explains
the joke to me and as shes pulled off as
per schedule i thinks its all right

   but it spoils things for telescope says
i you knowing about it spoils the hold-
up it might look like a fake sabe
thats right agrees art telescope
is a friend of mine and-i got it ill make
out that i dont feel good and ill ask
ricky henderson to drive for me he
wants to come down anyway

  thats fine says muley telescope
will make it right with you and we wont
tell him about today


adventure

  that night we dont have neither tele-
scope or chuck with us telescope is just
riding away as we come in and we dont
have a chance to talk with him and chuck
dont come home cause hes too danged
ashamed to face telescope

  the next morning the old man sends me
and muley over to the triangle to get some
cows that johnny myers brought out of the
sleeping crick hills with some of his and
we misses the picture-taking we travels
as fast as we can but the stage has gone
past when we hits the main road on our
way back there aint nobody at the hell
gate crossing so we pilgrims on to the
ranch

  about an hour later telescope comes in
and a little later chuck drifts home

  there seems to be a jonah on this job
states telescope

  what yuh limping about telescope
asks chuck

  hurt my knee reckon its a good
thing the stage didnt come down today
cause id a been a cripple in that pic-
ture slipped on a rock

  stage didnt come down i asks and
telescope shakes his head

  nope me and mister ames was there
for two hours after the time but she dont
show up

  didnt come down wonders chuck
aloud didnt go to paradise

  she sure didnt hadnt been there
when i left

  chuck looks foolish-like and gets busy
reading an old magazine i notices that
hes got it upside down but his lips are
moving so i reckon it dont matter hes
restless and dont sleep well that night

  the next morning right after breakfast
up rides bill mcfee our unworthy sheriff
ricky henderson art miller and a mc-
guire who manages the ground work of the
golden cross telescope limps over to
greet them and they seems a heap inter-
ested in telescopes walk

  what do yuh think ricky asks
mcfee

  id hate to swear to it bill but he
limped

  i arrests yuh in the name of the law for
robbing the piperock stage yesterday tele-
scope states bill

  telescope looks foolish-like at bill and
then laughs

  yesterday bill why it never-

   the description covers yuh states bill
i got your pardner who calls himself archi-
bald ames in jail -hes already admitted
the intent to rob it but says if you robbed
it he dont know nothing about it said
he was late meeting yuh so he dont know
what yuh might a done

   whoever done it got seven thousand in
that box states mcguire

  seven thousand wonders telescope
i thought the clean-up was brought down
yesterday

  some folks did grins mcguire we
figured to double-cross some wise folks

  i hears a deep breath and chuck sets
down hard on the step old man whitta-
ker comes out and they has to chaw the
whole thing over again

   well says the old man i dont think
that telescope done it but under the cir-
cumstances i reckon hell have to go to
jail

   at least yuh can have breakfast in bed
consoles muley and then he recites

   a man in jail dont have no cares

       the flight of time dont bother him

   there aint no place for him to go

       the passing hours lightly skim

   the judge may say a year or two

       in places where they dont need clocks

but you should care-when you get loose
youve seven thousand in that box

  muley when i get loose im going to
cut your rhymer square in two proclaims
telescope and just then the old man leads
telescopes bronc up and he rides away
with the posse

were sad doggone it sure is
a sad sight to see our compatriot
in the hands of the law we
smokes a while and then i turns to chuck-
where is that seven thousand chuck
he looks queer-like at me for a moment
and shakes his head

  danged if i know hen

   you had it didnt yuh

  nope listen i held up that stage
before it got to the ford sabe i was
going to chase ricky away and drive it
myself figured id have some fun with

telescope sabe well i scared-out

of ricky he aint got no nerves anyway
and-

  wait yelps muley do you mean to
set there and tell us that you scared ricky
so bad that he didnt know your physique
dough or dynamite



from telescopes how about the limp
dont rush me snaps chuck tele-
scope was so cocky about that picture stuff
that i figured to have some fun did yuh
ever walk on stilts well i did when i
was a kid i made me a pair that just
filled my boots and pulled a flour sack over
my head limp

  of course id limp i danged near fell
on my face when i yelled for him to stop
i made him get out and walk back up the
road and told him if he stopped id per-
forate him i took the box off the seat
which i figured was that shipment and looks
her over on it in big letters she proclaims
to be dynamite i lays that box back on
the seat gets my stilt tangled in a wheel
and fell plumb off the grade

  well the team ran away thats all i
know i figured that ricky would stop
em-they wasnt running fast

  what kind of a looking box asks
muley

  wooden box with two ends and four
sides regular dynamite box

  well described applauds muley all
we got to find is a wooden box with two
ends and four sides

  art miller comes back in about an hour
for some things of telescopes and we talks
it over with him

  must a been telescope or the party
what held her up that other time says
he the feller that me and chuck fussed
around with didnt have no limp

  maybe the exercise that you and chuck
gave him made him stiff and sore i suggests
and art grins maybe funny thing
about that hold-up after that feller helps
himself he must a scared that team cause
they runs away and scatters things all the
way up to mighty jones place where they
smashes a front wheel on a stump and stops

  ricky says there was a box of dynamite
from the golden cross the same of which
he holds careful in the seat he said that
he was meek when held up cause he was
afraid that feller might shoot into that box
that box is a goner and its a wonder it
didnt blow that outfit to thunder-unless
thats the treasure-box

  art pilgrims back towards town and we
all starts for the corral

  where yuh going asks muley

  after some dynamite dough says all
three of us together

  we rides up and down that road from

the ford to mightys place but we dont
find nothing we stops at the old soda
springs trail which shows fresh tracks
by mutual consent we turns up the trail
about half a mile up the crick we discovers
a camp

  we recognizes old frenchy timmons
as the party humped over the fire tossing
flapjacks so we rides up and greets him
hes got a couple of moth-eaten burros
nosing around his little tent frenchy is
so crooked that hes suspicious of himself
hes one of them kind of prospectors what
goes around with the feeling that every man
what speaks kindly to him is laying to beat
him out of the next strike he makes he
looks up through a decade of whiskers and
grunts a greeting

  hows your stock of location notices
holding out frenchy asks muley for
a man with only two burros you can make
more discoveries than any sourdough i
ever seen

  yah-h-h-h gurgles frenchy way back
in the whiskers i find heem sometame
mooley

  you dang well know yuh-yuh sure
have frenchy look

  muley points behind frenchy and there
one end sticking out of the brush is a
wooden box and the word dynamite
fairly yelps at us in big letters

  frenchy turns to see what were looking
at and the son-of-a-gun reaches for his
six-shooter he was years too late me
and chuck have him covered before he
can touch his gun and he stands there like
a lamb while muley balances that box in
front of him on the saddle-horn

  next time yuh better find out who owns
things before yuh picks em up for yourself
advises chuck throw that gun over in
the brush thats the stuff now keep
your mouth shut sabe

  frenchy didnt say a word but we can
see that hes a heap annoyed we strings
out down the trail and when were about
two hundred yards from the camp conies
a splintering noise and the report of a
big rifle me and chuck throws our broncs
off the trail and gets down we can hear
muley complaining about tilings and we
asks him why he feels so cross

  danged old pelican he wails that
bullet cut the comer off our box

  you still got it aint yuh i asks
  uh-huh i got her hen but she almost
	adventure

met her waterloo on a rock reckon it
loosened all the nails shall we go back
and smoke up that old coot

  next christmas replies chuck that
old coot has got a sharps - and the
warners dont care for that style of death
hes crazy muley and wed put ourselves
in his class if we went back

  we lifts that box back on muleys sad-
dle and went on

  we hits the road and makes good time
for a mile or two when we meets mighty
jones he stops and we exchanges pleasan-
tries we comments on the weather the
crops-which theer aint none-and the
general wear and tear on the human race
muley switches the position of that box
and the next second were covered by
mighty jones i starts to grin but when
i sees that mighty is in earnest i irons my
face out flat again

 hands up he snaps and muley lets that
box slip she hits the ground and rolls
over i glances at mighty and hes got
the look on his face of a man who has seen
all there is in life but aint reacjy to go
blind

  my - he gasps whirls his bronc

around and gallops off down the road like a
crazy man holding on to his hat with one
hand and fanning his bronc with the other

  we watches him fade away in the dust
and puts our hands down

  of all the locoed actions on earth thats
the sharp end of the limit proclaims
muley sliding off his bronc

  that last shock was almost too much for
that box cause when muley essays to lift
her she sort a opened on one end

muley holds his position for a
moment straightens up and gets on
his bronc without taking his eyes
off the box he spurs his bronc easy-like
until hes a few feet away from that box
and then he imitates mighty jones

  me and chuck puffs away on our cigarets
and watches muley depart

  ill likely get scared too but im taking
a chance states chuck and walks over to
the box

  he sighs deep-like and takes off his hat

  henry peck there must be a supreme
being what watches over fools and cow-
punchers this box is full of eighty per
cent dynamite come and take a look

  your word is as good as gold chuck

that stuff must have a good disposition to
stand all that grief lets go home before
something happens to irritate it

  we finds muley at the ford but he aint
got much to say he asks chuck if he saw
what was in that box and chuck said that
he did

  wonderful exclaims muley it stood
rough handling but i never thought a face
like yours could look upon eighty per cent
dynamite and not explode it thats why
i went away so rapid

  the old man is home when we gets there
and he announces that telescope and archi-
bald ames are still in jail

  what does archibald have to say about
it i asks

  that fat four-flusher yelps the old
man he says that telescope might a
done it of course this ames feller dont
fit the description but he might at least-

  im going down to see telescope an-
nounces muley

          he lies down there in durance vile
          behind the bolts and locks

           with prison staring in liis face
           cause we cant find that box

          that held a little bunch of gold

         which was labeled dynamite

          will we let our pal wear striped clothes

  not by a gol-danged sight i finishes
being somewhat of a poet myself

  muley shakes my hand and invites me to
join the perverted order of paradise poets
of which hes the only living member

  dont tell too much down there muley
advises chuck if you rims off at the
mouth i might get eased into jail and that
would cut down the number of detectives
on the case sabe

  fear not says muley i go but to
bring cheer to the needy i will be back
anon

  about three hours later doughgod smith
rides in and we walks out to where him
and the old man are greeting each other

  if this keeps on whittaker youre going
to be short of men states doughgod

  huh grunts the old man one man
dont make no difference this time of year
three punchers is enough to set around and
play cards and eat up good grub

  you only got two left now says dough-
god muleys in jail too

  muley snorts the old man whats
he in for
dough or dynamite



  stealing dynamite from mighty jones
chuck had started to set down on his
heels but when doughgods information
hits his ears he sprawls flat on his back and
blinks at the sky i starts to lean on a
buckboard wheel that is ten feet away and
i ends up on my back with my feet over
the tongue

  mighty spoke of some folks being ac-
cessory to the fact too states doughgod
offhand-like

  stealing dynamite yelps the old man
where when and what for

  i dont know mighty comes to town
and acts like a man what has had delirious
delight scared out of him he anchors to
fellys bar until hes gained normal again
and then he speaks knowingly of powder-
thieves mightys half-loco and what aint
loco is absent-mindness but just the same
he has muley arrested and he hints of more
arrests as soon as certain persons hit town
i seen muley and he said if i came this way
to have chuck and hen come to see him
thats right agrees the old man
well all go down

  not me says i i got rheumatic
pains in my knees notice how i fell over
that buckboard handle i aint myself
today and i simply couldnt stand it to
ride

  neither could i says chuck im
sore all over lets wait until tomorrow
muley will be there just the same

  well go in the buckboard says the
old man in a case like this id go if i
had to walk

  id admire to walk says chuck but
the old man goes after the team and me
and chuck helps each other limp to the
bunk-house

  shake hands with a murderer henry
says chuck offering his hand ive killed
the old man and crippled doughgod for life
-in my mind you and me will spend the
evening and night in the paradise jail
henry clay peck

  cant yuh think of nothing cheerful to
sing i asks if were in jail we never
will find that box think

  think- yelps chuck going to the

door im going to enjoy the untainted
air as long as i can

  i rustles out my war-sack and puts on
clean clothes its liable to be some time
before i gets a chance to change again
chuck comes back after a while and sets

down on the bunk disconsolate-like and
plays just before the battle mother on
his mouth-organ pretty soon the old man
yells to us

  we walks out slow-like and i climbs
painfully into the seat with the old man
chuck holds the team by the bits until
were all set then he lets loose and hops
aboard as we goes past we whirls out of
the yard and hits the road on the run sud-
den-like that equipage does a high dive on
one side and yours truly stands on his head
in a mesquite bush

  when i gets through making a cactus
pincushion of my cranium i riseth up and
looks around

  down the road about fifty yards sets the
old man gazing off down the road and cuss-
ing at a piece of line hes still got in one
hand i hears a groan across the road and
chucks head sticks up out of the brush

  the old man gets up out of the road and
painfully dusts off the seat of his pants he
plods up to us and looks us over

  by cripes he snorts i aint sus-
picious of nobody on earth im a man
among men and i dont suspicion nobody
but if that wasnt foul play ill eat the whole
ranch now ill haul you hombres to town
in a lumber wagon

  he plods on to the house while i extracts
cactus spines and cuss words from my car-
cass chuck limps over and rubs his hip

  light on a rock i asks and he feels of
his hip some more

  he reaches into his hip pocket takes out
an object and tosses it on the ground

  lit right on the darned thing he
groans

  its the nut off a front wheel of that
buckboard i kicks it off into the brush

and rolls a smoke

  well says he after a while you
can give me credit for blocking the wheels
of progress for a minute cant yuh ill
likely have to stand up all the way to town

  well get plenty of time to rest says i

we got to paradise but it wasnt
no pleasure-ride and the first per-
son we see is mighty jones

  mighty seems to have drowned his feel-
ings and hes spending his afternoon trying
to hold up the hitch-rack the old man
goes in the saloon but me and chuck goes
over to have a interview with our enemy
he nods at us like an owl


adventure

  tut-tut-tried to bub-blow me up he
stutters thas mean thing to-to-to do
tell us all about it old-timer says
chuck helping the old boy let loose of the
rack and leading him over to the side-
walk whats all this dynamite stuff im

guage

zas so fool to drop eighty per shent
awful careless

  where did you put that box you took

word distinct and separate

  mighty is so danged absent-minded that

  you took it out of the stage and then
what did you do with it

  somebody must a stole-whoa i
know in the woodshed i thought i put
it in the barn ain that the limit mus

old pelican wise as a barn owl mus
shee if ricky wants to hold him for stealing
that eighty per shent mighty jones is
law-abiding pershon know what i mean
we watches mighty weave down the
street and chuck grins all over his face-
well find telescopes and muleys
broncs and well go up to mighty jones
woodshed and rescue that money

  we finds both broncs in pellys barn so
we saddles up and fares forth we dont

fare far until we meets bill mcfee we
stops and asks bill if theres anything new

  nope says he i reckon we got em
in jail

  so says chuck bill how would
you like to take a ride with us and bring
back that seven thousand

   bill grins like it was a good joke
uh-huh id admire that whats the
joke

  aint no joke sheriff says i you
go with us and bring the gold back is that
satisfactory

   id admire to know a little more

not at all necessary says chuck
election is only three months away and
the credit aint going to hurt yuh none bill
thats sensible agrees bill im with
yuh

  bill attempts to find out things but we
dont talk much and its dark when we
climbs off at mightys place we hikes
right over to the woodshed bill lights a
match and looks inside drops the match
and dont stop running for a hundred yards
me and chuck gallops with him for a ways
sort of sympathetic-like

  bobcats whistles bill sheds full
of em

  yuh never can tell what kind of a pet a
nut like mighty is liable to have so we aint
surprised a lot

   i aint afraid of no cat what ever lived
states chuck im going to get that box
in spite of anything

   we pilgrims up close again with our guns
ready chuck finds an old newspaper
which he lights and we peeks around the
corner of the door and looks right into the
shiny eyes of two big cats three guns
goes off at the same time and three men
went away there aint a sound from the
shed so we sneaks back

  thats good shooting applauds bill
two shots killed em both cause i shot
in the ground

   sure was i agrees i did too
wonderful agrees chuck they must
a jumped high cause mine went through
the roof

chuck tosses in that burning paper
them cats are still there but dont move

  rugs snorts chuck mighty is sort
of a taxidermist and he put them eyes in
himself they sure look natural

  we found that box chuck makes a
presentation speech to the minion of the
dough or dynamite



law who recites a few appropriate words in
return bill takes the box on his saddle-
horn and we goes back to paradise

  we gets mcguire and all the rest of para-
dises population to see the grand opening
we assembles in pellys saloon and mike
furnishes the hammer

  gents states bill this aint a com-
plete exoneration of telescope and ames
but i reckon it clears em a plenty the
law recovers said stolen property but ill
let mister warner and mister peck tell the
story i can hunt lost things but i cant
tell a interesting story like some folks
you better superintend this mcguire
he continues its a lot of wealth to look
upon

  he tears the top boards off and paradise
gazes a plenty

  me and chuck takes one gaze and slips
loose we meets at the door ambles around
the comer and forks our broncs i follers
chucks lead and about a mile from town
we stops and looks back

  henry says he sad-like who do you
suppose put them rocks m that box
if i knew id be a murderer says i
and then it strikes me funny box of
scab-rock guarded by two mounted bob-
cats haw haw haw mister mcfee
we hereby puts in your care and cus-
tody one box the value of same being prob-
lematical you being a duly elected officer
of the law and we having faith in your
integrity and sense of duty turneth over
said box to be dealt with as yuh see fit
says i quoting chucks woodshed speech

  value being problematical takes the
curse off anyway hen says he

  its about midnight when we arrives at
the cross j the old man is in the bunk-
house and he looks us over sad-like

  what are you fellers trying to do he
asks the sheriff sure is one sore person
says he can prove that one or both of you
was mixed up in that robbery

  aw - snorts chuck i thought

it was the right box

  it was mcguire identified it the
question is this you knowed where the box
was-where are the contents thats what
paradise wants to know

paradise aint got nothing on us eh
chuck says i if they wanted to know
any worse than we do theyd all be sick
me and chuck talks it all over and decides
that the longer were out of jail the more

theyll have against us when we do get in
so we decide to give ourself up before were
liable to capital punishment

the next morning we rides away
to be locked up in self-defense just
outside of paradise we overtakes an
injun hes jogging along on a glass-eyed
pinto and he grins when he sees chuck
chuck stands in with all the aborigines
hello tenas charley grins the buck
hello hiawatha grins chuck where
you go so early

  you sabe doc milliken

  you bet why you wantum

  givum letter me got letter white
man hurtum leg no walk me go to doc
milliken sabe

  he fusses around in his blanket and pro-
duces a piece of paper chuck takes the
paper and reads the few words he hands
me the letter and grins it reads like this

hurt my leg follow the injun to me

  there aint no name signed

  heap scared informs the injun
hurtum leg on tree

  where you camp asks chuck and we
gets informed that its on little beaver
crick chuck gives him back the letter
and swings around so long setting
bull says he and the injun grins and bobs
off down the road

  now where i asks and chuck grins
slippery silverton he whoops if it
was anybody around here theyd a signed
their name hes hived up with that injun
and were going to land him henry maybe
hes got the gold too

  it didnt take us long to find that camp
we advances on foot theres a white man
setting on the sunny side of that teepee and
hes in blissful ignorance until me and chuck
lands on his shoulders like two playful bears
he gets energetic but chuck taps him on
the head with his gun and we hog-ties him
proper when he opens his eyes chuck
grins at him an says-

  hello slippery

  he dont say a word

  dont talk advises chuck yuh
might wear out your teeth

  the feller looks at us foolish-like so we
hoists him up on chucks bronc and chuck
rides behind him once he opened his
mouth and spoke one line

  you fellers are an hour late


adventure

  thats all he said i reckon chuck hit
him pretty hard

  we pilgrims right into paradise and up to
pellys saloon there aint a soul in sight
but we observes signs of life down where we
holds our court we takes our captive
down there cuts the ropes off his legs and
takes him inside

  the place is crowded and telescope is on
the stand we gets in just in time to hear
the judge ask telescope if he can think of
any earthly reason why he shouldnt be
held for the next term of court

  a lot of reason judge yells chuck
pushing our prisoner up to the front
heres the main reason gents i makes
yuh used to slippery silverton

  silverton- i hears mcguire yelp

thats the owner of the golden cross mine
mister warde and then he horns his
way over to our prisoner and snorts-
what does this all mean

  i dont know says the feller i-

i must a got hurt unless im mistaken
i came part-way from the mine with joe
allerton we had that gold shipment we
sent out two decoy boxes on account of
so many robberies we rode across the
hills joe figured on just making that train
he went to helena i wanted a pair of
moccasins and joe left me at that indian
teepee the owner wasnt there so i
waited thats all i guess somebody
jumped on to me and-here i am

  the-the gold didnt come down yes-
terday gasps mcguire and warde shakes
his head painful-like no just a box
of rocks

  just then in comes doc milliken

  say he yells will one of you strong
men come and help me set a mans leg
mighty jones cut a tree the wrong way and
it lit on him lucky he was found by an
injun who came for help he was able to
send a note but fainted before he could sign
his name all i want is somebody to hold
him down hes so absent-minded that
hes liable to run away he says to tell
ricky henderson that his box of dynamite
is either in the hay-loft or under his
cabin floor he cant remember which
art miller is standing close to chuck and
chuck grabs him by the arm and whispers-
what does a new wheel for your stage
cost art

  about eight dollars chuck-why
  heres ten dont ask me

  while there is plenty of talk me and
chuck backs out and rides out of town
were in the bunk-house when telescope
and muley and the old man comes home
telescope and muley comes in and looks
us over solemn-like pretty soon muley
climbs up on the bunk and recites with ap-
propriate gestures and feeling

   let me sing yuh a song of four danged fools
       four punchers whose brains are nix

   who done some things they ought not to do
      and got in a-of a fix

   one was stuck on himself and wanted to be
      admired at ten cents a throw

   another wore stilts so hed look like a man
       when he went out after the dough

   three of the fools fooled with dynamite

      one beat up an innocent man

    the price of a wheel was all that it cost

      you may beat it-i dont think yuh can

  beautiful says i youve got a
soul muley theres still that box of dy-
namite of mightys to account for

   he picked it up on his way home says
muley thats settled

   did archibald ames get his local color
i asks and telescope shakes his head
archibald ames didnt wait for nothing
he even hired somebody to drive him to
silver bend i asked him what he wanted
me to do and he told me to go to a place
where they dont cut holes in the ice

   youll miss them meals in bed sympa-
thizes chuck wiggling his ears and ducks
outdoors just in time

   a boot-jack splintered on the door be-
hind him

in the district of the upper ituri
where the ground begins to rise in
rhythmic waves as if summoning cour-
age for the mighty heave of the
mountains of the moon are patches of
grass land brown freckles on the green
face of the forest whose lips are the mouth
of the sun-kissed congo

  in one of these glades at the time of the
stirring of life from the noon siesta the
stagnant air was rippled as slightly as a
leaf impinging on the placid waters of a
lake by the breathing of a white man who
sprawled at the foot of a great tree his bare
head glowing like a pumpkin against the
fungoid bark a scarlet-and-emerald lizard
darted from the grass paused by the butt
of a rifle propped against the trunk and
flashed away at the quirk of the outstretched
arm a water-buck appeared like a warm
shadow twenty paces distant snuffed deli-
cately and vanished the yellow pall of
heat beyond the blue shadows shimmered

  as the dank silence was scratched by the
shriek of a parrot rose from the grass two
faint sounds resembling the softest gurgles
from a water-bottle

  the white man slept on one gaitered leg
thrown across the other within three
feet of them the stems of the rank grass
were parted slowly revealing the glimmer
of eyes again came the liquid noises
the eyes developed into the frame of a small
brown face woolly-headed having a squat
nose which seemed to snuff the air stealth-
ily followed as small a body wrinkled and
bony holding in a claw-like hand a tiny bow



and arrow two more raptorial beings
glided in his wake

  as the sleeper stirred and emitted a
choked sigh the three were frozen into
immobility but when the steady breath-
ing recommenced the patient creep began
again suspiciously continued until the
leader peered inquisitively into the pallid
face half-hidden by the red beard and hair

  the great frame twitched and the eyes
opened then as swiftly as the dart of
the lizard the rifle disappeared into the
long grass something-perhaps the blue-
ness of the eyes-stayed the fingers on the
bowstrings as the white man heaved on to
his elbow and stared at the two bronze
figures poised to shoot or to flee

  say he remarked quickly but amiably
i am pleased to see you

  the smile or the voice distracted the
savages one hopped a pace but the
leader held his ground

  i suppose continued the white man
smiling that if i take my eyes off you
youll consider it necessary to stick me
with one of those ridiculous arrows and
i notice that my rifles gone presumably
there are others of you possibly many
behind me probably

  he ceased to speak the bowstring of
the younger savage tautened

  very good my son pursued the white
man hastily as my melodious accents
seem to please you i will continue-
although i fail to see anything particularly
humorous in the situation he smiled

nothing doing eh now i suppose that
if i attempt to pantomime my most ele-
mental need youll surely misconstrue my
intentions presumably the primitive life
conduces to as cynical a view of other
peoples motives as does civilization is
that so

  the steady smile deepened but the eyes
did not quaver

  however wed better introduce our-
selves im professor john p ogorman
of the american museum of natural his-
tory very much-obviously-at your ser-
vice and you i presume are the original
pigmy nest ce pas sir i am most de-
lighted to have made your acquaintance-
having traveled some five thousand miles
for that express purpose certainly you
are most interesting i wonder whether
you would mind standing up no ah
well from this elevation i should hazard
a guess that you are not more than three-
feet-six-at most-and im six-three

  quite a gulliver eh you havent read
swift evidently your educational system
is as defective as the american ah you
dont appreciate the joke well no mat-
ter but by the way this smile is getting
rather worn and my shoulders devilish
stiff now i wonder-

  cautiously he began to move his arm
instantly came a water-bottle cluck and
the fingers tautened

  dear me observed professor ogor-
man this is the longest lecture ive ever
given-and such attentive students ive
surely never had but what in hell am i
to do yes yes i will resume now-
er-i wonder whether it would interest you
to know that your skulls appear to be sub-
brachycephalic more interesting than you
appear to suspect unfortunately i havent
got my instruments with me however-
i wish you wouldnt fiddle with that bow-
string it gets on my nerves

  yet i rather doubt whether the fire-
hardened point of that ridiculous arrow
would penetrate this cloth very inter-
esting point no i didnt intend to pun
im not feeling like that just now ive got
that disagreeable sensation popularly-and
most descriptively-known as pins and
needles in my elbow-and my shoulder
aches abominably now i wonder what
gesture would convoy william j bryan to
your bright young intellects

  he raised his right hand toward his

mouth phttl an arrow quivered in his
coat above his heart he remained motion-
less never relaxing the intent gaze nor the
fixed smile

  that gentlemen he said in a quiet
voice is distinctly an overt act

  very slowly he moved the arrested hand
plucked out the arrow and snapped it
between two fingers the two heads
quirked in a bird-like movement as he cast
the pieces on the ground professor ogor-
man saw indecision in one action he sat
up bunching his knees the savages
hopped backward and stopped to watch
as he tore open his shirt exposing a bare
white chest he grinned widely again
came the rapid clucks

  you forget that i always carry my note-
book in that pocket-although ill admit

that your-arrow does penetrate said

the professor and held out his hand

  they made no attempt to shake but
evidently understood the amicable sig-
nificance of the gesture

  good now well try again

  he motioned to his mouth masticating
imaginary food they put up their bows
and timidly suspiciously clucked at him

  no savee-the tower of babel

  they chattered and pointed across the
glade and at their mouths

  good i get you very hospitable

pptl as he rose the two little men

i	hopped to one side nervously and
i--stared up at the giant as if para-
lyzed by the realization of his height

  i hope you dont live far away re-
marked the professor as im - tired

and i wonder whether youll think me
impolite if i ask what youve done with
my rifle ah you devil as he caught a
glimmer of eyes in the long grass and the
blue gleam of the barrel

  the pigmy leader who erect looked like
a hairless ape clucked violently pointing
all right my son lead on

  the professor nodded vigorously but
the savage gabbled and hopped behind him
the professor hesitated then strode on in
the direction indicated

  - it he grumbled as the pigmies

trotted behind him across the glade like
children herding a red ox this is the first
time ive ever been driven

   but in the forest the professor was not so
fresh progress was laborious once he
john odamn



stopped and thought that he had lost his
escort-until a soft cluck drew his eyes
to a brown face and a pipe-stem of an arm
in the riot of greens pointing the way

  oh damn gasped the professor as he
slid into green slime to his knees this
stinks like hso

  the professor plunged on panting and
sweating scrambling from gnarled root to
root across acres of bog wading through
swamp and crashing through undergrowth
the relaxation from the strain of grinning
and talking for his life had cooled the
enthusiasm evoked by the meeting with
any being who merited the description-
however remote-of genus homo after thirty-
six hours in a hot dank prison whose walls
were green and clinging he began to
realize the gravity of his plight and his
temper began to fray he swore feebly
but venomously

  at last when the irritation of fatigue
appeared intolerable he suddenly became
conscious of twenty pairs of eyes regarding
him from the tangled screen of creepers
he stopped skinny arms and legs rustled
the leaves they swarmed down and
clustered round him a quaint band of
dusky beings scarce up to his middle

  good afternoon gentlemen said the
professor recovering his sang-froid with an
effort

  the sound of his voice evoked a gust of
dental chatter like a puff of wind among
autumn leaves a wizened being whom
with difficulty he recognized as the leader
of his captors so much alike were they
strutted in front of him pointing ahead
the professor obeyed expecting to come
upon a clearing or opening in the forest
in which the village would be located but
twenty paces away he was halted abruptly
by the sight of a strange being head and
shoulders above the little people whose
body gleamed pallidly in the half light of
the forest a being showered to the hips in
amber hair

  pithecanthropus murmured the pro-
fessor eagerly impossible-but-

 a slender arm was upraised as she
clutched a tendril one leg was poised for
flight the foot upon a branch with a
prehensile grip she peered in eve-like
curiosity at the red-bearded giant the
evidence of his senses bewildered the pro-
fessor-yet the presence of a lady brought
reaction-he took off his helmet

  amid a gale of clucks the girl appeared
to glide upward disappearing in the wall
of green amazedly he stared at the
circle of little men each with a bow strung
menacingly quickened by the need of
conciliatory action he held out his hand
the gesture was successful the wizened
elder loosened his bowstring and shot
upward into the tree clucking violently

  now what the devil can this amazing
person be grumbled the professor as
footsore black with sweat and slime he
sank on to a gnarled root

  for a few moments there sounded the
rustle of leaves and a faint purling as of a
brook over stones then came a scuttling
among the little men peeking at him as
from the wall of green emerged the girl
advancing upon a fallen log like an acrobat
her hair spread out like an amber peacock
tail each tress borne by one of the little
people who strutted in a crescent behind
her

  fearful of offending again the professor
sat with the helmet upon his knee at five
paces from him the cortege halted her
flesh he saw had a strange waxiness like
green ivory the abundant hair was of a
very fine texture the small oval face with
wild blue eyes was poised upon a well-pro-
portioned body-seeming like a tower of
chalcedony above the dark bronze escort

  while his mind fought with a flail of
questions he rose slowly and said very
gently-

  good evening madame

  she continued to stare silently her small
lips parted like an astonished child

  er-you speak english

  she did not blink

 hm vous ties francaise non
well-sprechen sie deutsch hm ilabla
espanol no nothing doing eh
pointing at him she uttered several labial
syllables a chill of horror affected the
professor as he realized that she could speak
no language save this-simian lingo but
how  earth had she gotten here these
people must have stolen her she was
evidently aryan-and brought up by these
monkeys away from all civilized environ-
ment terrible but    the pro-
fessors scientific mind and training over-
came sentiment he ejaculated-

  really the most interesting case ive
ever heard of

  she smiled-a white smile not a grin


adventure

exposing small white teeth-and darting
forward the escort attached seeming to jerk
forward like puppets on a wire ludicrously
she pulled the professors beard

  amazing ejaculated the professor
acutely interested

  he smiled at her she laughed silently
like a vastly tickled child

  she clapped her hands and chattered

  -it i wish you would not do that

exclaimed the professor it offends-
ones sense of what a lady should do
again she laughed soundlessly and paused
expectantly the professor stared she
drummed her small feet impatiently chat-
tered and suddenly pulled his beard again

  dear me remarked the professor
what is it that you wish me to do at
any rate smiling you seem determined
to get my goat

  as the professor guffawed she clapped her
hands delightedly and began to dance

  ho ho ho roared the professor
hands on knees tickled by the conclusion
that she connected the pulling of his beard
with the control of his laughter a guffaw
which startled her into a peal of clear
laughter

  he he he she squealed capering
madly in front of him apparently intoxi-
cated by her own vocal expression while her
escort rustled about by her jerking tresses
solemnly regarded this strange rite

  the reaction from this paroxysm left him
weak he sank back on to the root the
sudden solemnity sobered the girl she
gaped as he motioned to his mouth and
turning swiftly wrenching her hair from
her absurd courtiers beckoned and led him
to a fire smoldering at the foot of a great
tree as he stood gazing round for their
village or camp she thrust a blackened
calabash pot into his hands after pecking
at the glutinous mess with a forefinger he
recognized the faint sweety taste as wild
cassava which he bolted greedily regarded
by the little people with as absorbing
an interest as a launch of new yorkers
watching the excavation of a drain-pipe

  the food produced an intense desire to
sleep but the girl who had squatted to
regard him fascinatedly rose eagerly

  oh damn exclaimed the professor
irritably as she plucked his beard smiling
with childish anticipation nothing doing
savee i want to sleep sleep

  but having gotten the correct reaction

from the beard-baiting she began to clap
delightedly he gestured violently and
posed his head upon his hand the girl
regarded him inquisitively as if demanding
whether this were a new game then
comprehending began to swarm up a tree
the professor was nonplussed but as he
stared upward he observed what appeared
to be giant nests amid the branches

  oh my god he groaned now ive
got to be a bird

  with the aid of her prehensile toes she
led the band with simian ease but for
the professor with his bulk and heavy boots
the way was as hard as the path of righteous-
ness exhausted and panting he crawled
into a shelter formed of branches interlaced
across horizontal boughs and sprawling
in a corner sank instantly to sleep amid a
crowd of chattering women and children

  from a ridiculous dream in which he was
in a hospital being tickled by nurses he
became semiconscious a real poke in the
ribs elicited an ow and brought him wide
awake to find that he was packed like a
codfish in a tin of sardines between moist
limbs and bodies

  a vivid realization of his environment-
and the stench-impelled him to dash out
of the hut only quelled by the recollection
that he could not fly now and again
above the rhythmic breathing and the drip
of the forest which sounded like eternal
weeping came the dismal hoot of an owl
the professor groaned swallowed a mouth-
ful of fetid acrid heat and lapsed into the
slumber of the exhausted

ii

jksi the strain of thirty-six hours wan-
dering in the jungle although it had
not killed scientific interest in his
amazing discovery had clouded the pro-
fessors mind until the elemental needs of
food and sleep had been satisfied

  but when he awoke to find himself alone
in the green light of dawn he realized fully
the gravity of his plight these little
people were undoubtedly the wild pigmy
of the forest seldom seen or even glimpsed
by whites or negroes a primitive shy folk
who even in bartering with their com-
paratively tame brethren of the forest
fringe would only consent to leave skins
at a tree in the darkness and return the
following night to collect the sweet potatoes

or copper wire or other produce left for
them they were nomads neither culti-
vating nor fighting living mostly on edible
roots and game in the deepest recesses of
the congo forests

  the professors camp was two hundred
miles from the nearest belgian outpost
and he was-he had no idea how far from
his camp what chance had he of being
rescued as he stared despondently at
the glow of sunrise leaf-patterned on the
forest roof he could hear them chattering
he listened mechanically noting four
distinct clicks-a labial kissing sound
dental as a monkey chatters palatal as
a carter encourages his horse and a lingual
a gurgling klop-klop of a water-bottle so
he concluded that their language consisted
of combinations of these four clicks

  interesting he mused but how the
devil was he to communicate with them
to ask aid to offer a reward he knew a
little kiswahili the lingua franca of middle
africa but they no word as he jotted
down notes he became aware of a looseness
in the waist his belt had gone hence
the ridiculous dream of nurses tickling
the devils had the cartridges as well as
the rifle however there was nothing to
be done but to make the best of the situa-
tion by studying the conditions what a
splendid monograph he would be able to
write-if ever he got free

  as he continued to scribble the girl swung
from a bough into the communal nest
squatting on her haunches she smiled at
him he smiled she chattered and
stretching out her hand pulled at his
beard

  good morning then said he as evi-
dently thats what you want eh

  she laughed a loud peal of delight
imitative continued the professor
probably youve never laughed aloud in
your life until you heard me savages
never do however you seem to enjoy
it thoroughly satisfying a repressed
instinct she gesticulated delightedly
splendid now for the first thing suppose
we begin a lesson your imitative faculty
should help you some food food
food he repeated pointing to liis open
mouth get that

  but she chattered and pointed below
no not yet i want you to say it my
dear listen-foo-d foo-d

  as he leaned toward her mouthing the

word she goggled and perked her head on
one side like an inquisitive sparrow after
he had performed about twenty times she
pursed her lips

  fool she said blowing it at him

  not bad said the professor now
again-foo-ddd

  but she persisted in counting it as a new
game blowing at him and giggling the
professor considered and pointed to his
mouth and below immediately she swung
out of the nest with the effortless ease of a
monkey he clambered after her watched
by a dozen- faces below were the ashes
of a fire the girl proffered him a lot of
the cold or tepid cassava

  oh damn ejaculated the professor
with an image of breakfast food before him

  the girl laughed delightedly

  hm said he sticking a finger in the
mess -of a joke isnt it

  while he ate-not much-he regarded
the crowd of men and women they
found him a most absorbing object the
women wore no ornaments of any kind
not even the usual tribal cicatrices the
woolly hair was unkempt on even the
stoutest of them the ribs showed plainly
in contrast to the white girl who although
lean was well fleshed

  evidently mused the professor heredi-
tary powers of digestion and resistance-or
perhaps she gets the pickings

  overcome by a longing to know the exact
conformation of the skull he advanced to a
young pigmy judging from her breast
with a squeak she fled instantly the
white girl chattered angrily provoking
much clucking among the tribe which was
finished by the girl seizing the child and
dragging her up to the professor

  she protested volubly he hesitated
fearing to rouse their ire but concluding
that the girl had the power of a chief and
guessing at their conception of his in-
tentions decided that it would be best to
disabuse their minds so while the girl
held the terrified child he ran expert
fingers over the skull estimating shrewdly
the dimensions and formation

  then just to show that there was no
favoritism he turned his attention to the
white girl she stood as still as a rock as
his fingers fumbled beneath her hair
gravely extracting his memo-book he made
notes the little folk watched the magic
ritual in complete silence


adventure

  thanks very much he said bowing
solemnly

  the girl laughed seemingly eager for
the slighest excuse to exercise her newly
found vocal accomplishments and he
noticed that save for the head man who
had grinned no facial contortion re-
sembling mirth ever disturbed the pigmies
features-tending to the conclusion that a
sense of humor only developed in ratio to
the intellectual development

  the compliance of the lady suggested that
he might be able to enlist her aid in recov-
ering his rifle and cartridges he patted
her arm to emphasize approval and pointed
to his waist and peered around the girl
watched him attentively chattered and
began to make a hoarse screaming noise

  puzzled the professor again pantomimed
the missing belt which elicited once more
the bellowing as the girl pointed at him
and to the forest the noise suggested
a bad imitation of a cow lowing

  but a cow-here murmured the pro-
fessor

  she laughed delightedly gestured at the
stolid folk still gazing and then walked awaj
beckoning immediately the professor
moved the whole tribe followed him the
sight of one little man bearing a smoldering
stick and of women loaded with babes and
calabashes gave him an idea they were
on the march

where were they going prob-
ably deeper into the forest making
escape more improbable than ever
as the professor halted the tribe stopped in
his wake the wizened little captor mate-
rialized pointing a pipe-stem arm two
yards away the girl waist deep in under-
growth beckoned the sun was merely
an incandescent glow through the roof of
the forest the professor could not take
his bearings and had he been able to see
he was not sure in what direction he had
wandered from the camp perforce he
must obey

  as he plunged on the tribe melted away
except for the girl leading him but they
were there now and again he could catch
a glimpse of a tiny brown leg or arm a
head and hear the click-click of a conversa-
tion in the dense green

  to the professor the struggle was almost
insupportable but the little folk slid
through the jungle as snakes glide through

grass occasionally the professor was com-
pelled to rest panting and exhausted
sometimes the harsh screams of a flock of
parrots broke the eternal dripping of the
forest and the perpetual rustle of the
myriad life

  and they stuck to the cursed forest
forest all the time once when an open
glade was sighted through the cavernous
gloom the professor jibbed and pointed
earnestly to the blinding spread of sunlight
but the girl chattered and beckoned
straight ahead and a dozen thin arms
protruded through the green walls always
was he conscious of those eyes watching
ever driving him

  sometimes the girl would squat on the
limb of a tree and watch him patiently
when the exasperated professor cursed
aloud she would laugh delightedly-and
the professor swore anew twice when
he failed to curse she approached and
pulled his beard and he hed with
delight at the torrent of oaths with which
the professor reacted

  as they were traversing a piece of com-
paratively dry going she suddenly leaped
a clear six feet to the right he stopped
the girl chattered at him excitedly at
first the professor could see nothing then
a mass of brilliant green leaves and dark
shadows moved he saw the coils of a
snake the professor moved quickly

  the farther he went the more anxious
grew the professor they might be off
on a weeks march for all he knew he
couldnt do it no white man could

  at last at  by his repeater the
professor mutinied he sank down on a
root and refused to budge he made
signs of sleep the whole tribe only
fragments of it visible discussed the
situation energetically but the professor
didnt care he slept

  when he awakened from a short doze he
found the girl squatting a few feet from
him as motionless as a sphinx no sign
of the little folk could he see but he had
learned enough to know that they were
not far off immediately she saw that he
was awake she approached and pulled his
beard

 the professor had thought this was
funny at first but now he was tired and
irritable he scowled and spoke no word
she seemed surprised and she made a move
to repeat the action but the professor
john odamn



snarled fiercely showing his teeth like a
red-muzzled irish terrier she appeared
to understand the menace and desisted
then after a pause she pointed to her head
the professor stared she reached and
taking his hand put it in her hair for a
moment he left it there puzzled to know
what she could mean he laughed she
wanted to have her bumps read again
the tickling sensation was pleasing

  he scratched her head she whined
as soon as he ceased she chattered at him
but he shook his head smiling she
plucked his beard this time the pro-
fessor felt better-tempered

  all right my dear said he you can
get the reaction this time as its up to me
to make you my friend if ever im to get
out of this-and if you like ill take you too
would you like to

  she laughed in delight and danced about
youre a base flatterer you know he
continued humoring her i never guessed
that i had such a charming voice before
as a matter of fact its the music of your
own kind that pleases you i wonder who
the devil your people were how old are
you not more than fifteen i should think
by your development-allowing for the
tropics

  she glided close to him and put down her
head

  well im - said he i know

dogs love to have their ears scratched but
never a human dyou know youd be
rather a beauty if you had a wash and got
dolled up a bit what i cant get is how
on earth youve gotten your color you
certainly have the most extraordinary pig-
mentation say now wouldnt you like
better to come with me and get the benefits
of civilization eh if i can get out of this
i guess i can get you with me and it isnt
the thing to let a white stay with these
friends of yours what do you think
he stopped scratching and held her
face up

  what do you think

  she smiled delightedly and put her head
down to be scratched again

  no no look here

  he held up her head and pointed to
himself to her and the vague distance
she stared puzzled for a moment and
then arose evidently prepared to resume
the journey

  no no exclaimed the professor vigor-

ously you dont get me come here
he beckoned

 obediently she came and sat beside him

 thats it now lets try another lesson
 watch me foo-dd

 f-oool she blew at him ready for the
 game again

 oh damn said the professor

 oh damn she echoed back at him

 the professor nearly fell off the root
 he stared she seemed impressed with the
 effect

 oh damn she repeated distinctly

 with an effort he repressed the impulse
 to laugh aware jjiat for some subconscious
 reason she had gotten the impulse to
 mimic

 foodd he said solemnly

 she repeated the word clearly-

 foodd

 good he ejaculated in triumph

 goodd she mimicked

 fine said the professor now-
 tapping his chest-john

  onn

 no good listen-jo-hn

  onn she repeated

 oh damn swore the professor dis-
 appointedly jo-hn

 john-oh damn exclaimed she

 oh splendid shouted the professor

 john oh damn she repeated joyfully

 peal after peal of laughter startled the
 little folk and fifty pairs of eyes watched
 from the clouds of green this strange magic
 of the white folk

ill

 that afternoon the professor de-
 cided that the better plan was to
 delay their march as much as pos-
 sible accordingly he resolutely refused
 to move they chattered and clucked
 but to no purpose the professor had
 mutinied for some reason that he could
 not fathom they finally elected to camp
 on the ground swiftly making shelters of
 boughs and grass

 desperately he kept on with the lessons
 in english whether from a natural or
 hereditary aptitude she picked up words
 with surprising celerity many she got
 muddled misconnecting the sounds with
 the objects try as he would he could not
 dissociate the name john with oh damn
 so that she continued to touch him on the


adventure

 chest with much delight saying john 
 damn followed by a peal of laughter

  all through the heat of the day grimly
the professor played the wonderful new
game besides the interest in teaching
her and getting a little inside this strange
anomaly of a mind there lay the principal
chance of escape

  one morning in the midst of a lesson she
put her hands on his chest and began to
pick at the fastening of his shirt the
professor almost blushed he held her
hand wondering what on earth she was
after she chattered at him expostu-
latingly saying

  good good john oh damn

  then she pointed to her own breast to
his chest and at the little people

  for a while he could not imagine what
she could mean finally out of curiosity
he unbuttoned the shirt and dropped his
hands to see what she would do with a
quaint gesture like a monkey opening a bag
of nuts she pulled the shirt apart the
exposure of his bare chest startled a litter
of clicks a finger touching his flesh and
her own acquainted him that she was
pleased to observe that they were both of
approximately the same color

  by the end of a week she had gotten the
sense of fully a score of words into her head
and with such a vocabulary much may be
done they were all words of simple and
concrete objects verbs were limited to
go come stop sleep each at-
tempt to invite her to escape with him
was doubtful for the most he could attain
was to suggest more than one white man
the vague distance and that she would
go with him she had assented eagerly
laughing but whether she had understood or
not he could not determine only could he
await an opportunity

  evidently the savages had thoroughly
established the identity of race or godhood
whichever it was between the two for now
a separate shelter was erected for each of
them and his primitive behests were
obeyed without question except-the return
of his rifle and cartridges for even gods
were not to be trusted in their estimation

  on one day the tribe did not make any
attempt to persuade him to march and
were very excited the girl in explanation
made the cow-like noise again which was
explained later by the bellowing of an
elephant

  come come said the professor

  come echoed the girl

  she led him through the jungle to a
swamp where an elephant hamstrung by
the little people lay wallowing and trum-
peting in death agony with half a dozen
tiny arrows in the soft of the joints

  the professor demanded his rifle but
the girl replied that the beast would
sleep when the elephant did sleep
the little folk were soon crawling over and
in the vast carcass like ants over a chunk
of meat they camped immediately and
forthwith gorged themselves to repletion-
to sleep to wake to eat again the pro-
fessor was in despair yet he was weak and
thin and the meat food was strengthening
he noticed that the girl ate moderately-
instinctively apparently

  on the fourth day amid much chatter
they began to move although the greater
part of the carcass remained they made no
attempt to carry any away with them
perhaps knowing no method as did more
civilized tribes of preserving meat but
they did remove the tusks this made
the professor think hard he decided
that hope of escape lay in the fact
that as ivory is of value all over africa
that even these peoples would desire to
realize something upon it and would con-
sequently approach nearer to a more civil-
ized tribe to barter for wire or implements

  in the dank cavern of the jungle all ways
were the same to the professor so that he
could not surmise whether they had
changed their direction or not however
in desperate hope he no longer tried to
delay progress but marched as long and
as hard as he could on the third day they
came to an open glade about a mile across
and halted a terrific discussion broke out
evidently like apes they feared to leave the
trees for they waited on the fringe until
scouts had returned from the long grass
and the tops of high trees

  then came another commotion the
girl refused to enter the open chattered
violently gestured the professor was
puzzled at her fear until she pointed to the
blazing sun and at her body

  ot she said persistently ot ot
using her english vocabulary

  then the professor understood why she
had retained her color acquiring the greeny
pallor in the stewing atmosphere of the
jungle but this refusal to leave the
john odamn



shelter might mean a serious bar to their
escape he reflected

  good-good said he patting her
and taking off his coat he put it upon her
she made no resistance by her smiles
and oh damns she seemed to consider
it a great joke and without further ado
capered on ahead into the sunshine
laughing

  evidently she decided that the coat was
good medicine for on entering the forest
on the other side she made no attempt
to return it the professor acquiesced
saying good good and she laughed
crying oh damn john oh damn
delightedly

  but the glimpse of the sun had informed
the professor that they were going north-
which meant toward the boma masindi
trail from uganda

that evening there was much
excitement in the tribe which the
professor mistakenly translated as
being near to an alien people they camped
high in a tree which indicated that some
danger was apprehended for the first
time since he had lost it the professor saw
his rifle-being dragged into a nest on an
opposite bough he drew the girls atten-
tion energetically making the most of their
vocabulary to his surprise she assented
saying-

  come-john oh damn

  she chattered across the tree which
resulted in two pigmies bringing the
rifle

  eagerly he opened the breech-to find
that somehow they had contrived to work
the ejector for the cartridge had gone
and upon examination he discovered the
barrel to be full of slime he managed
to clear it after a fashion but the rifling
was rusted from breech to muzzle how-
ever the professor attempted to conjure
some cartridges cursing the professor
went to bed

  at the hour of the monkey he was
awakened by the girl he sat up abruptly
at her no good-oh damns the moon
was full and high around in the tree the
little folk were clicking away as softly as a
spring shower upon a roof then his ear
caught a peculiar sound-a distinct drum-
ming as of native tom-toms

  a village must be near he thought
joyfully but the girl kept whispering

  no good oh damn no good oh
damn

  she pushed a cartridge into his hand
as she tugged at his shirt sleeve he
crawled to the edge of the nest platform
noticing that her eyes registered extreme
terror as she pointed downward

  a glimpse in a patch of spattered moon-
light made him catch his breath-a gorilla
half-erect was pounding its hands on the
enormous hairy chest

  as the brute vanished into the blue
shadows another appeared moving side-
ways like a gigantic crab-and another

  now the professor comprehended why
they had restored the rifle evidently not
understanding how to use it they desired
him to defend them but one cartridgel
he held up the cartridge saying no
good-five and lifted both hands for as
he had learned the little folk could only
count to four five two hands upraised
conveyed plurality generally

  the girl brought him two more

  oh damn he whispered

  oh damn she murmured encour-
agingly

  hastily he attempted to ram home a
cartridge but try as he would to manipu-
late the ejector the cartridge would not
enter the rusted breech he scraped at it
in the gloom with a penknife the car-
tridge jammed half-way and would neither
go in nor come out he peered below again

  the gorillas were still around the tree
they were cornered there was nothing
to do but wait and trust that the brutes
would not be moved to attack

  as the girl lay beside him along the great
bough she pointed down and at herself
whispering

  me me

  the professor pondered and imagined
that she meant that these brutes were her
parents

  no good he murmured your biologys
all wrong my dear

  yes yes she insisted pointing at the
great apes below at the pigmies and then
at her breasts muttering persistently
me me

  the professor grasped the fact tl iut she
knew that she had been stolen from her
people by gorillas as the orang-outang
steal native children in borneo and prob-
ably he surmised rescued by the little folk

  the rhythmic thrum of the beasts


adventure

continued to the rustle and squelch of the
undergrowth the green pallor of the
moonlight above was warming to the glow
of dawn save for an occasional click as
soft as rain-patter the pigmies were
silent

  peering as far over the branch as he
dared the professor strained to see more
of this strange rite of the great apes only
as they passed in the spattered patch of
moonlight could he catch a glimpse of each
performer whose terrible teeth were bared
in a snarl of ecstasy the hairy paws pound-
ing rhythmically upon the mighty chests
as far as the processor could determine
they were moving shuffling sideways
in the most primitive dance in the world
round and round the tree as if it were a
maypole

  just as he was wondering whether the
beasts were given to this social amusement
when the mood took them or whether as
with all savage tribes the moon was the
instigator there came a squawk the crack
of a branch breaking and the rustling of
leaves in the passage of a heavy body
falling to the accompaniment of a terrified-

 eh eh eh

  instantly the rhythm of the great apes
ceased there was a momentary silence
then one of them seemed to bark a com-
mand answered by grunts of rage from all
sides a hail of chatter broke out among
the pigmies the girl dragged at the pro-
fessors shirt hissing

 no good oh damn no good-oh
damn mixed with excited monosyllables

  he heard the phtt of arrows and much
rustling of undergrowth from which arose
savage grunts then immediately beneath
him appeared a dim face with small vicious
eyes black holes of nostrils and a cavern
of a mouth set with wolfs teeth clicking
violently the girl tugged at his shirt anew
but the professor realizing that he could
not compete with a gorilla in speed at the
top of a tree clutched the bough with his
legs as -he swung the useless rifle by the
muzzle at a hairy squat body propelled
upward with the ease and swiftness of an
elevator

  the rifle-butt crashed on the shoulder
muscles beside the conical head and as
swift as the riposte of a skilled duellist
a paw shot out plucked the weapon from
the professors grasp and holding by his
prehensile feet the great beast buckled

the rifle in half as easily as a child would
bend a reed

  a clutch at the professors boot toe
hastened his movements as he turned
he saw the slim leg of the girl disappear into
the foliage above him but as he stood up on
the bough in a desperate attempt to follow
her his boots slipped he grabbed at a
small branch which tore away in his hand
was conscious of the gorilla yawning be-
neath him and clutching wildly-fell

when he grew conscious again
he was aware of some one tugging
at his arms he began to kick and
struggle imagining that he was in the hands
of the gorilla then a familiar oh damn
no good oh damn reassured him

  he was lying half-submerged in a morass
beneath the great tree from which the girl
was trying to drag him the sun was
incandescent through the patterned roof
he lumbered heavily out of the slough
covered in green slime from head to foot-
but slime which had broken his fall and
saved his bones around him was the
gentle rustle and drip of the jungle

  good said he sitting on a root but
whats happened

  he peered about near at hand was
the elephant tusk sticking upright in the
swamp but there was no sign of the
pigmies nor the apes he sighed and
wiped some more slime out of his eyes
bending forward she pulled his green beard
and laughed delightedly as he smiled

  good for you he commented but
where are your friends friends-where-
no good-here he translated with appro-
priate gestures

  good said she go-go-go and
pointing to the forest mimicked with both
hands and -feet suggesting climbing and
running

  yes yes i get you assented the

professor but-

  he made faces beat upon his chest and
grunted fiercely she clapped her hands
delightedly and pointed in the direction
which the tribe had taken t

i see the gorillas have followed the
tribe eh lucky for us-or rather me
good brave girl you stuck to me good  
she appeared to comprehend for she
laughed pleasedly

  but what are we going to do you-
gesturing-me-many me- tapping his
john odamn



chest and holding up two hands-go-
find-huh

  again she clapped delightedly

  splendid come along

  he arose eagerly but he dared not go
without his hat or some covering she
understood after a while and mounting the
tree with effortless ease fetched his helmet
from the nest

  good go go

  but she started off toward the recesses
of the forest immediately the professor
sat down saying no-no-no vigorous-
ly back she came and pulled his beard

  oh lord groaned the professor exas-
peratedly

  oh lord she mimicked and danced
about laughing

  come on he exclaimed starting up
once more but as he turned one way
she went off on the pigmy trail again the
professor stopped and considered the
situation seemed more hopeless than ever
apparently she did not understand or if
she did did not wish to assist him to leave
her tribe natural after all he reflected
he thought of exploring on his own
leaving her to follow or not as she wished
but-in what direction was he to go
if he could find an open glade he might
be able to work out some idea of direction

  the girl had halted watching as if
waiting for him to follow when-the report
of a rifle startled him he listened in-
tently fearful that his ears or his imagina-
tion had misled him for a rifle meant either
a white man or at least a semi-civilized
native again came a report close at hand

  with a wave of the hand and a shouted
come on the professor plunged forward
slipping and scrambling toward the sound
quite regardless mirabile diclu of whether
the girl was following or not crazy at the
call of environment which that shot
symbolized

  fifty yards beyond he was wading in
swamp to his waist toward the silver of
sunlight upon open water just as he
hesitated again another shot rang out
directing the professors attention to a
canoe beyond the trees in which like the
gleam of the sun upon a house window
was a white helmet sending him floundering
on regardless of crocodiles or any beast or
lady yelling hoarsely

  the uncouth noises had attracted the
occupants of the canoe the paddlers

stopped the blessed figure in the helmet
turned round to stare the canoe began
to approach the shadows of the over-
hanging forest the professor ceased to
yell climbed into the handiest tree and
waited not until the canoe was within
hailing distance did the professor think
of the girl he peered around she was
close to him but high up in a tree staring
open-mouthed at the strange vision of the
canoe the professor laughed with relief
and waved a hand to her crying

  good good come come

  but she did not seem to hear him she
stared-stared

  qui est id came a voice from the bright
sunlight

  oh god me yelled the professor in
his tremendous relief and recovering his
sense of reality added-amcricain

  norn dc dieui echoed the voice over the
still water

  the canoe shot forward more swiftly
under the branches into the swamp grass
a small black-bearded man in the helmet
gazed curiously at the gaunt figure of the
red-headed giant with a green beard and
slimed clothes as the paddlers poled
their way the two white men exchanged
explanations the little man was an
italian in the belgian congo service upon
a shooting-trip upon the semliki river
he had heard by runner of the loss of an
american professor very distinguished etc
and bade him welcome and congratulations

  but said the professor as the canoe
was forced through the grass beneath him
i demand a thousand pardons but i have
here-what would you call him-an extra-
ordinary phenomenon-a lady white who
has been brought up among these-your
pigmies-very charming-and whom i
wish to bring with me she is i assure you
the most interesting case i have ever
encountered in my life

  enchanted assented the italian
come good began the professor
hanging on to a branch as he looked up
toward the girl but she was not there

  then in the spattered sunlight beneath
the forest roof he saw her cloud of amber
hair upon the khaki coat and one slim leg
which blended with the green of the forest
leaves as it vanished in the distance

  oh damn-shes returning to the tribe
exclaimed the professor and added yet-we
are only creatures of environment after all

jimmie bellew put his feet up
on the bookcase knocked the ashes
out of his pipe into an elaborate
silver rowing-trophy and relaxed in
lazy contentment

  hand along the humidor walt he
requested

  his friend bestirred himself sufficiently
to reach with the tips of his fingers a
cunningly mounted skull with a brown
porcelain lid and give it a shove which
sent it plowing its way through an assorted
litter of pencils and note-books and little
wicked knives on the table to stop right
on the edge by the others elbow

  ha phenomenal judgment as usual
commented jimmie and proceeded to fill
his pipe from the grisly relic

  the room was small and correspondingly
cozy with the battered furnishings and
grotesque adaptations of natural objects
to the needs of student life which are so
dear to the heart of youth engaged in the
pursuit of knowledge the walls were
hung with the usual varied assortment of
pennants and boxing-gloves and photo-
graphs of athletic teams the typical den
of a young man whose thoughts were con-
cerned more with the strenuous outdoors
than with the honorable pursuit of medicine

  jimmie blew two smoke rings endeav-
ored to throw the stub of his match
through them and then suddenly sat bolt
upright

  yep he said with finality im
going to take a crack at it and i think ill
get away with it walt

  walter jamieson smiled with the supe-

rior condescension of the man who has been
through the thing and knows

  youll flunk he said with conviction
that physical test is ascorcher

  the younger mans face flushed just a
trifle alert-eyed hawk-nosed hawk-
faced generally with a hard lean body to
match he certainly did not look as though
any physical examination in the world
should hold terrors for him but the test
they spoke of was the much-deliberated
designing of an over-careful government
to weed out all but the most perfect speci-
mens of manhood in the country jimmie
defended himself eagerly

  flunk me eye barring that sinus
operation i had im as fit as any man alive
ill pass everything else with a whoop
and youve told me yourself when youve
taken me up that i have all the earmarks
of a good flyer

  ocular and muscular balance entirely
my boy you know darn well that for a
couple of months after your operation you
walked like a souse and you used to get
seasick and all that your canals are all
wrong man and that cold scientific re-
volving-chair thing will get you in a minute
it got bud blakelock they said hed
never be able to carry out a night bombing
raid where he couldnt use his eyes and
bud has been doing stunt stuff for
years

  jimmie leaned forward and lowered his
voice with instinctive caution

  it got bud blakelock walt because
he hadnt spent three years in a medical
college but it wont get me ive been


sense of balance



boning up on the flow of the lymph in the
auricular canals and i know all the normal
reactions by heart i can fake that stuff
as easy as winking

  the older man looked at him through
half-closed eyes

  why not get a test from one of the
faculty your trouble was two years ago
maybe youre quite all right now

  jimmie fell silent he knew that that
was just what he ought to have done long
ago but like many a consumptive or heart
patient he was afraid to face the truth
when he spoke it was in a low monotone
looking away from his friend

  you see-its this way walt i want
to do my bit and i want to do it flying
and-i guess ill fake the chair test
jamieson read the youngsters thoughts
like a book he smiled grimly

  and you want to do it flying hm
well it has been known that a man may
develop such a very keen sense of muscular
balance as to overcome the ear defect
but theres more in this flying game than
just the mechanics of it nerve my boy
nerve or rather nerves i should say

  theres the psychological aspect of the
thing you may get away with the
physical exam but youll know when
youre up in the air that you lack that
certain requirement and that knowledge
will break down your confidence without
confidence some day your nerve will go
then youll make the high dive

  rats said jimmie with the omniscience
of youth

  jamieson smiled still less grimly but with
a pinch of determination about the lips
quite made up your mind

  yep quite going to pull all the strings

i	can to bag a commission shoot in my
application tomorrow

  well then the smile was faintly re-
nunciative im coming in with you
you

  yes i-i think sometimes that i need
something to give me a jolt to help me cut
out this stuff it dont fit in with flying
he indicated with a lift of his eyebrow the
tall tumbler which stood at his elbow

  jimmie jumped up with a glad exclama-
tion

  good for you i hated to say it walt
old scout but ive been thinking that way
for quite a while myself gee im awfully
glad why with your experience theyll

make you a gold-lined lootnant right away
mm-m maybe hope so anyway
maybe when you get through with your
ground stuff ill have you for flight instruc-
tion howd that be

  bully jimmie enthused lets go up
together tomorrow

jimmie bellew was dead right

in both of his forecasts his friend
jamieson an experienced aviator
was called for examination with the least
delay possible and the next news that was
heard of him was that he had been ap-
pointed to a second lieutenancy in the
army signal corps jimmy himself after
a period of waiting during which exhaustive
inquiries were made into his mental and
moral fitness for that most exacting service
finally received notice one day to present
himself at headquarters forthwith for the
prescribed physical examination

  as his friend had warned him it was a
scorcher five hours of exhaustive search
by skilled scientists for the least possible
traces of unsuspected defects which might
some day result in disaster as jimmie had
said however he passed everything else
with a whoop five-feet ten of hard wiry
athlete there was no reason why not

  came then finally those delicate ear tests
the cold merciless probing of scientific
machinery for a possible clogging of the
lymph flow in the semi-circular canals of
the inner ear which act as the spirit-levels
of the body jimmy was the least bit
nervous but confident withal his un-
bounded confidence of youth had not been
broken down-yet

  hearing of course was perfect jimmy
had no fear on that score he could hear
a whisper at twenty feet without diffi-
culty and he knew all the tricks of the
examiners about pretending to hold a watch
somewhere behind his head but that
deadly revolving chair that inexorable con-
trivance which had blasted the hopes of so
many aspirants to the great game  
jimmie took his seat with a half-smile of
alert readiness a sergeant grasped the
lever and spun him rapidly

  enough called the examining surgeon
suddenly and looked into jimmies face
with a watch in his hand

  jimmy knew that his eyes ought to roll
wildly for about five seconds he rolled
accordingly while the surgeon ticked off


adventure

the time and made a note of the result in
his record sheet

  all right again now

  this time the whirl was a longer one

  right stop now what do you see
point to it

  what jimmy saw in front of him hap-
pened to be the bald high forehead of an
eminent scientist he knew that a normal
person would point a foot or so to one side
of it without hesitation he did so

  hm remarkably quick reaction mut-
tered the surgeon arid made a favorable
note to that effect a short respite fol-
lowed and then jimmie was told to sit
forward with his head bent over his knees
the chair was then spun in sharp jerks once
to every two seconds for about twenty
revolutions

  now straighten up ordered the sur-
geon sharply

  jimmie straightened up and instantly
heaved himself over tugging at one arm
of the chair as though to right a falling
aeroplane

  hm youll do the examiner smiled
thats all you can dress now

  jimmie grinned covertly to himself and fled

  yes dead right was jimmie bellew he
had faked that stuff and got away with it-
so far

tjm in due course presently jimmie
ifixjl was notified that he had been ac-
ru-ui cepei as a candidate for a com-
mission in the army signal corps and was
ordered to present himself again at head-
quarters where the signing of various
documents and the taking of sundry oaths
awaited him from there he was sent away
to the great ground school at newport
news a full-blown member of the united
states aeronautic service

  at the ground school he learned all about
stream lines and aspect ratios and angles
of incidence and lift-drift coefficients and
the mysterious names of cloud formations
with their approximate heights and he
washed acres of aeroplane wings with
gasoline and was initiated into the art of
twanging brace wires like a banjo to see
whether they were tight enough and there-
after he graduated through the successive
stages of third second and finally first
mechanician and was eventually promoted
to grass-hopping in a low-powered ma-
chine

  all these things jimmie with the benefit
of his previous instruction under his friend
jamieson learned with unusual rapidity
and with the further benefit of thpse
favorable notes on his report-sheet about
the quickness of his nerve reactions he
began to be looked upon as a very prom-
ising subject he was picked out from
among the many who were condemned for
some failing or other to ground work for
all time and posted for air instruction
yes jimmie bellew was marked down for
a flyer-and only jimmie knew about the
clogged lymph in his left ear which had so
much to do with his sense of balance

  in due course again jimmie found himself
commissioned as a second lieutenant and
hustled off to mineola for advanced in-
struction there in keeping with his lucky
streak he found his friend jamieson now
a first lieutenant and-unprecedented luck
-he managed to come under him for
tuition

  those were good days for jimmie long
filled-up days of hard work and teeming
interest and earnest endeavor anybody
would have considered himself lucky to
have the personal interest of an expe-
rienced flyer like walter jamieson and
jimmie progressed rapidly from mere pas-
senger observation to being allowed to
handle the dual deperdussin control him-
self and to make wide easy banks and long
glides with a watchful hand of his teacher
on the other wheel to check up the in-
variable beginners mistake of over-control

  he began to get the feel of the air
that sensation of the supporting planes
having a tangible grip on something which
is so markedly distinguishable from the
emptiness of a side slip he had the natural
gifts of quickness of thought and presence
of mind which go to make a good flyer
and presently he was promoted to single
hops he was allowed to take a machine
up alone he experienced the thrill of
controlling immense power at immense
heights the wild exhilaration of speed it
was the call of the bom bird-man

  good days but there was a tiny spot
in the clear sky of jimmies contentment
a little gray spot like a mote before the eye
which can be winked away but which is
presently there again a little blacker than
before and jimmie in his ebullient youth
began to realize that perhaps the man with
experience might know something after all
sense of balance	

nerves jamieson had spoken of the haunt-
ing knowledge of defect jimmie could
whoop along at a hundred miles an hour
and could make a sixty-degree bank but
how much of that was pure muscular
sense of balance he found himself wonder-
ing and how much did he have to rely
on that swaying air bubble in the red arc
of the inclinometer attached to the dash-
board in front of his control wheel

  that was a mechanical spirit-level and
it turned his thoughts inward to his own
spirit-levels inside his head bud blakely
would never have been able to carry out
a night raid when he could see nothing
they had said to what extent then was
that defective ear of his affecting him and
how much of his flying did he owe to his
eyesight

  a troublesome little speck that which
kept recurring with disquieting suddenness
apropos of nothing

  jimmie thought he would try one day
to find out how long he could fly with his
eyes shut that surely would prove some-
thing he climbed to a good three-
thousand level to allow plenty of room for
recovery in case of accidents and then
with his lean jaw clenched in determination
and his hawk brows drawn down in a fierce
frown he pinched his eyes shut hard he
sat tense while the machine hurtled along
for nearly two minutes the tight lips
began to spread in a smile it was easy he
said to himself

  then a side puff struck him and the
machine heeled over to the left instantly
he whirled the wheel over in the opposite
direction and instinctively he opened his
eyes immediately the great planes rocked
over to the right he had badly over-con-
trolled in his anxiety in a second he had
righted the machine again but his heart
was in his mouth when a man is three
thousand feet up in the air it takes very
little to make him taste his whole internal
system

  after a few minutes the hammering of
his pulse calmed down and he tried to
analyze the thing he had felt the tilt
while his eyes were shut that was all right
but was his over-control due only to over-
anxiousness-or had he gaged the angle
of deflection all wrong and would he
have righted the machine with his eyes
still shut he thought yes but then
again-maybe not

  that little speck was growing apace
later reviewing the matter in the less
strenuous environments of terra firma
jimmie tried to persuade himself that the
thing was quite all right not once or twice
but many times he told himself so the
thing lived with him he spent quite a lot
of his spare time telling himself that nothing
had been wrong-but he hated to try the
experiment again

  that kind of thing is bad for the nerves
of men who are supposed not to have any
nerves but it is surprisingly good for
cankerous specks under the stimulus of
suppression the dark growth throve amaz-
ingly and began to assume a horrifying
shape jimmie was something of a mental
analyst he knew what was happening
to him those three desultory years of
college had not been entirely wasted

  that spook has got to be laid said
jimmie firmly

  he hit upon a solution on his next
instruction flight he said to himself he
would try the experiment again under the
controlling hand of his teacher it would be
safe the next time accordingly he did
try he shut his eyes tight and waited for
the feel of whatever he might feel for a
while there was nothing to do and then
came one of the usual little dips which
needed correction jimmies analysis of
self had not gone quite deep enough he
was still over-anxious and he made the
same old mistake

  he felt the instructor in the rear seat
with his greater leverage take the control
firmly out of his hands and right the
machine for a star pupil this was a
disgrace jimmie felt very much ashamed
but that vital question simply had to be
settled presently he experimented again
this time the corrective force was applied
with a jerk of impatience jimmie burned
all over but he set his teeth and deter-
mined to see the tiling through

  whatever might have been his con-
clusions about himself there was no mis-
taking the instructors attitude after that
with angry bruskness he took the control
entirely away from his pupil made a wide
bank and came down without further ado
on to the flying-field that lesson was
over-and jimmie had learned nothingl
as soon as they had climbed out

  what the deuce was the matter with
you snapped jamieson crossly you


adventure

were flying like a -- fool beginner i
have enough to do teaching the elementary
stuff to that kind

  he seemed to be unreasonably irritable
it reminded jimmie uneasily of the old days
when his friend had looked a little too freely
on the tall yellow tumbler and jamiesons
face was unnecessarily flushed too jimmie
wondered

  he would have liked to tell his friend all
about his experiment to have made a full
confession of his trouble and asked for
advice but the opportunity was not ripe
just then he reflected he would wait for a
more favorable one but somehow that
opportunity kept postponing itself with
heart-breaking indefiniteness

  lieutenant jamieson in common with all
the other instructors was frantically busy
for one thing with the pressing need of
training as many men in one day as used
formerly to be handled in a month and
for another his irritation seemed to have
settled on him permanently now when
jimmie in desperation sought his friend
at his quarters in the hotel one evening
and made bold to mention the matter
jamieson laughed self-consciously and
flushed and explained

  its an awful strain on ones vitality old
man to take up fifteen or twenty boobs
every day but lets not talk shop now

  which explained nothing or rather
not enough jimmie wondered some more

  in the meanwhile the days sped on and
jimmies unlaid ghost walked at his heels
but his confidence was still unshaken he
felt sure that his mistakes had been due to
nothing more than over-anxiety all he
needed was to prove it to himself till
suddenly there came the first big jolt
which shook him into a realization that the
man with experience not only might know
something but that he is usually right

  two of the huge new sperry search-lights
were installed in the flying-field and it was
rumored that the more advanced pupils
were to be given practise in night flying
then only did jimmie know that jamieson
had spoken deadly truth on that first day
in his den his little subterfuge had be-
come a curse and had come home to roost
with the knowledge hanging over him
that the little physical defect which had
looked so inconsequential at that time
remained still untested his confidence in
the pinch had broken down

  jimmie had run away and hidden himself
in his room to think over this new menace
when the full force of it struck him with all
its pitiless clearness the speck had sud-
denly grown to maturity and taken a
definite and horrible form it had a shape
and a name it was fear

  second-lieutenant james bellew of the
army signal corps was afraid

  the thing was unspeakable infamous
jimmie fought it desperately for long
terrible hours he tried to convince himself
that it was only a passing hysteria born
of cumulative brooding but the thing
stood out before him solid in its merciless
accusation there was no dodging it
jimmie was afraid to take up a machine
in the dark he flung his arms out over
the table and hid his face with shame

a week passed and jimmie fought
with his fear and with the greater
fear of having somebody discover
lis fear a dozen times he made up his
mind to test himself out once and for all
and a dozen times he went up and did not
dare to try the fearsome experiment the
thing had got a hold of him he would
confess everything to jamieson he deter-
mined and then with his co-operation he
would decide the matter definitely on his
next instruction flight

  but no instruction flights were forth-
coming for jimmie jamieson was too busy
with the less advanced pupils and with
experimental work on the night tests
and he was so confoundedly morose these
days no time could be wasted on a flier
who shaped so well as jimmie did-by day

  then lists were posted with the names
of officers who had been selected on account
of their good showing for promotion to
night practise jimmies was well up near
the top he began to go about with a
hunted look and to evolve desperate plans
to postpone his turn until he should have
found out about himself he felt half
inclined to go to captain wilson in charge
of the flying-school complain of ear
trouble and get himself reexamined

  that would be easy and plausible and
he would then be automatically relieved
from flying-duty without anybody having
found out his shameful secret but here
came in a curious anomaly jimmie wanted
to be a flyer the great game called to him
irresistibly and he had besides the pride
sense of balance



that went with his lean-jawed type of face
surely was jimmie caught between two
fires of his own making

  he haunted the night practises praying
desperately for some unexpected oppor-
tunity to go up as a passenger many
passengers went up but jimmies luck
was running strong on the ebb now some-
how it never so fell out that he was called
and junior officers are not encouraged to
be importunate when there are a host of
seniors who are anxious to experience a new
sensation

  then one night when the immense search-
lights were stabbing through low-scudding
layers of cumulus clouds and flooding rain-
bow billows on to the next layer a thousand
feet above jimmie found himself standing
near captain wilson the flying-school
chief turned to him

  how about making a short jump for us
mister bellew we want to see if we
can pick a machine out from behind those
cloud patches imagine were being raided
the conditions are ideal for a practise

  jimmies heart almost stopped beating
the thing was upon him with appalling
suddenness

  why er-yes sir he managed to say
certainly er-can i take up twenty-
four

  twenty-four was his favorite machine-
and twenty-fours engine was out of com-
mission jimmy calculated that he would
be able to get away on the excuse and that
presently tired of waiting they would send
up somebody else

  sure said captain wilson

  jimmie hurried off elate and then the
captains voice calling after him chilled him
to the marrow

  oh wait a minute i believe twenty-
four is on the sick-list youll have to take
one of the others

  yes sir jimmie mumbled just got
to get my helmet and he fled

  as it happened they did get tired of
waiting they would have had to wait
beyond the patience of any man for
jimmie was hiding in his room other fliers
were a-plenty somebody else went up
jimmie had got away with it-this time

  but that sort of dodging could not go
on indefinitely jimmie was one of the
young officers posted for night practise and
as such it was his duty to be present on
the field during these experiments other



occasions arose and jimmies frantic ex-
cuses began to draw wondering attention
in that hazardous game there were always
keen observers ready to pick up the slightest
signs of wavering on the part of the less
experienced students people began to look
sideways after jimmie and whisper

  jimmies hawk eyes snapped up these
covert glances in a second and he burned
all round to the back of his neck as he
passed again the temptation came strong
over him to report in to the chief medico
for ear test but jimmie had come into
this game with the intention of fighting
for his country in the aviation service
and unless he should prove to be physically
unfitted he was going so to fight he was
deadly afraid and deadly ashamed but he
gritted his teeth and hung on

  jimmie roomed in the same hotel with
jamieson he passed the latters room
every day on his way to his own but it was
not often now that he looked in on his
friend for one thing his own primary
impulse was to hide from everybody and
for another walt was not at all companion-
able of an evening nowadays

  today however jamieson called him in
the tone was both domineering and
derisive jimmie entered and shut the
door perhaps this would be his long-
waited opportunity jamieson sat slumped
down in his chair with his feet stretched
far under the table his khaki tunic was
carelessly open at the neck and his cap lay
on the floor he regarded jimmie for a
long time with a dull eye while he kept
nodding his head with sententious wisdom
then his lip curled in a foolish caricature of
his old slow smile

  so its come huh he gibed whatd

i	tell you s got you hasnt it scared
thats what theyre all saying afraid to
go up

  jimmie flung his head down on his arm
and groaned he had hoped for under-
standing and sympathy from his friend

  jamieson rambled on

  yeah dead scared-my star pupil too
after all i taught you-fraid to go up

  there was an emotional self-pity in the
tone that was almost maudlin this wasnt
like walt jamieson or rather not like
what he ought to be jimmie looked up
quickly his own misery was heavy
enough but his concern for his friend
drowned out for the present all other


adventure

considerations jamieson sat looking at
him with foolish mournfulness jimmie
had seen that look before

 walt he burst out with genuine
solicitude youre not-you havent been
touching the stuff again

  jamieson flushed jimmies suspicion
was enough to straighten him up in his
chair he laughed shamefacedly

  well hang it all you know its an
awful strain on the nervous system taking
up so many beginners every day im all
worn out and i need some stimulant
jimmie stood up and stared at him with
horrified eyes

  but walt you-you cant he whis-
pered tensely

  jamieson was suddenly perfectly sober
he passed his hand wearily over his eyes
he couldnt face his friend

  yes i know he said quietly looking
at the floor im going to cut it right out
lets get together tomorrow and talk over
things about both of us im dead tired
but tomorrow jimmie was detailed to
some routine work which took him off the
flying-field and the next day jamieson was
furiously busy with a flood of instruction
and was held late into the evening in a long
consultation about something concerning
the big search-lights and on the third
day the list had come down to jimmies
name for night practise so jimmie in-
continently reported himself sick he did
not dare to think of that flight before he
should have settled things with his teacher

  later however toward evening it was
rumored that night practise was all off on
account of some other more important
thing on hand so jimmie put a bold face
on it and presented himself at the flying-
field pretending that he had heard nothing
of the change of plan

eflgs he found the night lit up like
the san francisco exposition
long milky rays from half a dozen
search-lights stabbed far up into the sky
and cut the moonless blackness into a
kaleidoscope of geometrical figures it
was just such another night as that recent
one when he had so ignominiously fled
wide shifting banks of cloud hurried over-
head at various levels

 whats the program he asked a
sergeant who stood near with a sheaf of
flight-report forms in his hand

  spotting experiment sir imaginary
raid from here on philadelphia lieutenant
jamieson will go up and the lights will try
to pick him up at both ends theyre just
trying out their current now

  jimmie watched the display full of
gloomy thoughts he would have given
his soul to go up with his friend on the
long trip for there surely they would be
able to put his accursed problem to a test
but it was too late to attempt to make ar-
rangements everything would have been
scheduled long ago-and in any case it
would probably be a one-man flight

  his surmise was correct in a little
while he saw a fast curtiss baby scout
wheeled out into the open and the mechan-
icians busy themselves about it soon the
captain of the flying-school arrived with
a group of senior officers captain wilson
looked up into the sky with satisfaction

  splendid night for the experiment
he remarked bit gusty though i fancy
well be able to follow him for at least six
thousand but ill bet they wont pick him
up on the other side before he is right on
top of them hope he wont keep us
waiting been rather a habit of his
lately

  one of the officers stepped aside and spoke
to an orderly jimmie could follow the
man as he passed from one lit-up hangar
to another looking in all the likely places
where a prospective pilot might be he
was away a long time captain wilson
began to show signs of impatience

  suddenly a wild suspicion flashed into
jimmies mind was it possible he
thought surely not but jimmie wasted
no time in empty speculations he stole
behind the hangars and commandeered the
first car which came to hand and raced
out to the hotel it was only a short five
minutes he rushed up-stairs and burst
into his friends room

  it was possible it was a hopeless fact
lieutenant jamieson sat there a picture of
dire retribution his eyes burned blood-
shot with fever a wet cloth encircled his
brows and his face was propped haggard
between hands that trembled like an ague
patients

  walt whispered jimmie hoarsely
theyre waiting dont you know

  the wretched man nodded wearily

yes he croaked i know but-i
cant fly tonight i-i had a fierce day
sense of balance



today and-they rung this in on me un-
expectedly-take advantage of the clouds
but-

  but walt theyll-theyll be here look-
ing for you in a minute and-itll break
you foreverk take a hold on yourself

  jamieson shook his head in weary resig-
nation

  yes i know he murmured again
but-impossible

  jimmie looked at him with horror any
second a man might arrive from the field
and there would be no excuse for an offense
of that sort the realization hit jimmie
like a tangible thing there was force
enough behind it to take his breath it
was preposterous to contemplate that
his friend should be irrevocably broken
under the inexorable law of the service-
his instructor to whom he owed everything
he knew it was almost a blasphemy

  jimmies mind worked furiously sud-
denly he gasped and his breath left him
entirely for seconds he stood just as
he had been struck a cold stone statue
and then his deep eyes began to burn and
slowly his lips began to set then sud-
denly again he was electrified into swift
purposeful action

  lock your door he hissed at jamieson
and keep it locked and he rushed from
the room

  captain wilson was striding a short
impatient beat and fuming with aggravation
when an automobile dashed into the field
and drove close up to the waiting scout
machine before it stopped a lithe figure
all muffled up in leather coat and helmet
and goggles jumped from it it saluted
from the distance called huskily sorry
to have kept you waiting sir and climbed
agilely into the pilots seat

  all right boys im all set let her go

  everything had been ready to the last
little item for many minutes a nimble
mechanician spun the propeller over it
caught up the ignition with a roar and the
light little machine sprang forward like an
impatient race-horse

  captain wilson whistled his amazement

  well he certainly was in a deuce of a
hurry to make up for lost time bet hes
grinning all over to think hes avoided a
censure

  but nobody could see the desperately
serious eyes behind those goggles and the
white knuckles which gripped round the

  control wheel and the grim-clenched jaw
as the machine lifted from the ground and
circled to the left in a steep climb jimmie
knew nothing of any instructions which
might have been given for the procedure
of the flight he knew only that he was
expected to rise to at least six thousand
feet and then to make for philadelphia
but he didnt much care whether he carried
out the program correctly or not his only
impulse was to get away from there to
gain time while his friend might recover
and his whole will was grimly centered on
accomplishment somehow

  long shafts of light stabbed at him as
he circled they lit up-the surrounding
air like day coming as a special blessing of
heaven to enable him to settle down and
pull himself together during the first few
minutes when the first cloud came be-
tween he felt an instantaneous qualm and
sat tensely expectant while the machine
hurtled on but even here was a certain
diffused radiance from the giant lights
below it was providentially helpful he
found himself making the old mistake of
over-control and he set his will to getting a
grip of himself and correcting that

  presently a long pencil of light caught
him again and seemed to hang itself on to
the rushing machine then another licked
across and back again and caught hold
then more clouds then for an instant
a pale flash passed him and jimmie could
follow the thin ray crisscrossing about
feeling into the night like a ghostly white
finger and then he was lost for good in
pale formless starlight

   and still he flew at a very fair horizontal
jimmies teeth relaxed a little from his
bruised lower lip and he began to think
with less rigid effort

  far to the southward he could see
through the flying clouds the beacon
light on the summit of the town-hall tower
that was a fair mark for philadelphia and
he knew then where the flying-field was
he headed the machine for it straight as
an arrow a hundred and twenty-five
miles his speed if only he could hold her
level for about forty minutes more

jimmie hummed along for several
minutes more at his high altitude
on an astonishingly level keel but
the clouds bothered him he put her nose
down to it and slanted through long banks


adventure

of them like a shooting star it was
darker down below but less confusing
several more minutes sped behind and
with them several miles jimmie began
to wonder why he found the controlling
so easy-just as though there was not a
single disturbing puff of wind his mouth
relaxed almost into a smile he began to
feel the old elation of power and speed and
then right in the middle of his triumph
something happened

  jimmie heard a thin shriek above the roar
of his engine and instantly he felt the
machine keel over terrifyingly and begin to
slip frantically he tugged at the wheel
all his resolutions about over-control thrown
to the winds the machine answered
beautifully nothing had suddenly broken
as had been jimmies first blood-chilling
thought but that sudden diabolical stroke
was only the beginning after that every-
thing was either wildly over-controlled or
hopelessly under-controlled

  all that beautiful security of balance
which jimmie had been congratulating
himself on had vanished as though be-
witched away from him something had
gone terribly wrong with the controls but
there could be no stop for investigation
for twenty frenzied minutes the machine
rolled and dipped and rocked like a leaf
through the terrifying blackness jimmies
every muscle was tense with the readiness
for instant action and the sweat rolled
from him with the exertion of it how the
machine lived through it he never knew
it was a mercy of providence that he was
kept too frantically busy to think

  when he finally managed to get the
crazy controls in hand again he found
himself sailing in a creamy glare of long
convergent rays coming from far ahead
and somewhat to the right mechanically
he pushed the depressing control and when
he came to earth a few minutes later his
mind was still in a whirl he was just
worn out mentally and physically

  officers crowded round him and shook
his hand proffering congratulations which
were beyond his comprehension how
should they know that he had accomplished
something which to him had been a fearful
ordeal he found himself feeling irre-
sistibly tired and sleepy he murmured
evasions and excuses by the thousand
and finally broke away and stumbled to a
car and eventually to a hotel

  he had slept for about three minutes
when he thought he woke up still dreaming
his dream was that his friend jamieson was
shaking him fervently by the hand and
mumbling a vague jumble of gratitude
and happiness and congratulations one
sentence impinged clearly on his con-
sciousness

  by golly they all thought you were done
for when that squall hit the world

  huh jimmie sat up with sudden
wide-awake interest howd you get here
so soon d you fly through it too was
that thing that happened a squall
jamieson took him hilariously by the two
shoulders

  fly no siree first train out this
is tomorrow morning already son and
squall well i should say it was dam
nearly a typhoon

  gosh marveled jimmie god knows
how i ever steered her i was too scared
to think i just pulled everything in sight
by instinct

  jamieson threw back his head and crowed
why thats just it jimmie my boy
all this time youve been so darn scared
youve been cured your canals are per-
fect phenomenal you could never have
done it on muscular balance alone youve
flown a stunt son youll get all kinds of
credit out of it

  me jimmie started from his bed
nobody knows me here personally-i was
all goggled up anyway and if by any gods
chance they dont know you either then-
say did they get you in the hotel
no nobody knows a thing thanks to
you old friend you saved me from that
and-jimmie boy i-i guess you saved
me from the other too i saw a whole lot
last night when you went off like that
and i knew what it meant to you-and
when that storm came up and you were
in it while i lay there like a helpless swine
i-well im done with that stuff jimmie-
for keeps

  then said jimmie stoutly lieu-
tenant jamieson flew that machine here
and lieutenant jamieson is going to fly it
back ive already got more out of this
thing than all the credit in the world ive
got confidence walt old scout confidence
his friend gripped his hand again hard
and with confidence he said slowly
some day youll fight for your uncle

the road through platt river
flats is a trial to pedestrians a
despair to wagon drivers a tor-
ment to motorists it is a
double rut of shifting sand winding through
a wilderness of dense slashings heavy
growths of stunted trees and a riot of black-
berries in the undergrowths half con-
cealed under these growths is an abattis of
fallen cedar trees and hemlock logs hurled
aside when the timber pirates looted
michigan of its wealth of pine

  south of the bridge that spans the platt
this road is a tunnel through dense growths
the land is flat and in places swampy
north of the bridge the road bounces over
a series of short hills where blueberry
bushes mat the earth and the raspberry and
blackberry bushes and stunted trees strive
to hold the earth against the torrential rains
and the winds that beat upon that exposed
point jutting out into lake michigan

  wherever the roots are torn away the
elements rip great holes in the sandy soil and
the winds pile up the great shifting dunes to
smother out other vegetation

  if one struggles through that trail he will
presently emerge upon high land and gaze
northward along the magnificent bluffs to the
majestic sweep of the lake on clear days
looking toward the straits he may see the
islands the indians called manitous-the
foxes and a glistening silent mountain of
white sand jutting out into the blue-green
of the lake the point called sleeping bear
from the hill tops he may look eastward

upon a string of gem-lakes set down between
great dunes

  but behind him he the flats-once a
glorious country of majestic pines-now
ravished and left to desolation save for the
scattered clearings where homesteaders
battle against the wilderness

  in that arena surrounded on three sides
by orchard-crowned heights bisected by
the short-lived river that serves to empty
the dune-prisoned waters of platt and little
platt into lake michigan the war of the
lunds and the barneses was fought

  lund head of the tribe was named
john he had come with his family of
boys and girls from sweden whether by
choice or necessity none knows the new
world of which perhaps they had expected
much gave them little john lund had
been a fisherman and a fisherman turned
farmer seldom succeeds

  perhaps there were high hopes ambitions
dreams that ended in a homestead in the
wilderness the tribe of lund increased
the winters were long the harvest season
short always the berry vines the stub-
born undergrowths the rank weeds out-
grew the corn and potatoes in the little
clearing the rains washed the sandy
soil the winds heaped sand over the
crops

  mrs lund having proved more produc-
tive than the soil yielded at last and john
lund was left with a swarm of boys and
girls who ran wild-human undergrowth
that thrived physically on berries and




adventure

fish and game-and starved morally and
intellectually

  later to an adjoining homestead came
henry barnes and his three boys they
were from the east farmers seeking cheaper
land henry barnes had theories and his
chief theory was fruit his boys were
strong had attended school and had profited
by their fathers education to the barnes
boys the new life in the wilderness was ad-
venture the hunting the fishing the joy
of clearing the land and erecting the stout
cabin furnished them a prolonged vacation

  the beginning of the feud is shrouded in
mystery at first the barnes boys had
tried to be friendly and to include their
neighbors in their sports and work per-
haps the lunds were envious whatever
the cause the lunds proved suspicious un-
neighborly and had sullenly rebuffed all
advances the year after the barnes
family came into the flats they started to
erect a line fence between their homestead
and that of the lunds and john lund re-
sented the act

  two or three times fences were torn down
barnes protested the lunds denied the
boys joined in the quarrel and there was a
fight in the road afterward whenever a
lund boy met one of the barnes youths
there was a fight and later the fathers
took up the quarrels each time barnes
had emerged victor from physical encoun-
ters with his neighbor lund sullen bit-
ter planned to secure revenge

  one terror rules the flats men who
fear nothing else show anxious strained
faces when they see a curl of smoke over
the wooded desolation in time of drought
there is little sleep and the whisper of one
word will bring homesteaders leaping from
their beds the dread word is fire

  it was this terror that john lund in-
voked against his foe

one night the barnes family
slept in their cabin the wind rose
to a gale that swept down from the
straits roared between the manitous beat
upon the old sleeping bear and howling as
if with the voices of the long departed mani-
tous descended upon the flats and raged
as if to tear loose the roots that held the
soil against its fury

  on that night fire sprang up in the flats
was fanned into fury by the gale and swept-
down from three points upon the clearing in

which the barnes family slept billows
of flame leaped across the narrow plow-
ground the potato vines withered and
burned the pasture dried by hot winds
crackled a moment and was black

  faggots of burning brush wind blown
rained down upon the cabin and after a
fight barnes and his boys fled and all night
they remained standing deep in the water
of the lake strangled by smoke scorched
by the flying embers when the fire passed
they crawled from the water gazed upon
the smoking ruins of their house and crops-
and vowed vengeance that day henry
barnes found where the three fires started

  during the winter and spring barnes
and his boys grubbed and cleared worked as
never before and felt the pangs of hunger
they cleared land the fire had left un-
touched grubbed the roots of burned
bushes and saplings and as they dragged
brush and chopped away the tough branches
of dead trees the father said grimly-

  throw it over on john lund

  by early summer a barrier of brush and
bushes marked the boundary line when
summer and the drought came they piled
more brush and waited in august a gale
blew from the south fast strong and to-
ward the lund clearing at midnight
fire started and before daybreak the lunds
were homeless and their crops were ruined

  for more than twenty years the war
raged other homesteaders came into the
flats but few remained five times the
fires had swept over the barnes place
leaving desolation each time barnes and
his sons set to work in grim silence en-
larged their clearing and after each attack
henry grimly ordered his boys to throw
it over on john lund each time his
vengeance was heavier he was patient
and could wait until fire was most effective

  with each attack the lunds shiftless
and indolent became poorer the barnes
clearing increased orchards grew and bore
fruit the thickets were driven back until
the buildings were beyond reach of fire un-
less the entire flats were swept the riot
of weeds and berry bushes pressed closer
and closer upon the lund cabin making
revenge easier

  twice after the barnes clearing became
almost safe buildings on the place had been
fired in the night and each time henry
barnes and his boys waited and when the
wind blew from the right direction burned
throw it over on john lund

the lund homestead the lunds beaten
scattered john died the boys and girls
went away working on the lake boats and
only jim remained

  death claimed henry barnes two of the
boys married and moved west and on the
two homesteads lived ben barnes and
yim lund hating each other the
feud was not dead but smoldering because
ben lived up to the creed of his tribe-to
strike only in revenge and then strike
harder and because yim feared ben-
feared him because he could not understand
a man who could wait four years for the
brush to grow in order that his revenge
might be the more terrible

  that was the status of the feud when i
came upon the scene having built a shack
on the lake ben was my nearest neighbor
and we became friends he was tall and
straight his long hair was white and his
eyes were blue he wore khaki clothes
and moccasins in summer he went through
the woods bareheaded and in winter he
wore home-made fox-skin caps and gloves

the summer was long and dry
the thunder storms that brooded
on the horizon each day poured
their precious burdens into the lake or went
away growling toward the straits and the
land parched berries withered on the
bushes the indians became lean and after
a time broke summer camp and returned
to their reservation homes

  the creeks and even the lakes dwindled
in size leaves curled upon the trees the
corn withered and grew yellow the choke-
cherries shrivelled into black beads on the
trees and the evergreens became yellow

  ben came to see me at longer and longer
intervals and remained only for brief calls
he said nothing but there was a worried
frown on his forehead and as he talked his
eyes roved along the crests of the great tree-
clad hills beyond which lie the flats

  when i visited his place he was busily
engaged in mowing weeds cutting down the
berry growths in fence corners with a
scythe and as the corn was beginning to
form ears he cut several rows around the
edges of the fields for ensilage

  it was his odd custom to sing a snatch
from some old song at the completion of
each chore but for weeks he did not sing

  late in august ben stopped at the cot-
tage in the afternoon he had been com-

pelled to go to town for supplies and was
hastening back when i hailed him we had
been talking only a few moments when
suddenly he sprang to his feet and sniffing
the air he stood anxiously regarding the
crests of the hills to the northward he
resumed his seat and the conversation but
within a few moments leaped to his feet

  i smelled smoke he said have you
been burning brush

  no i said it must be from the
kitchen fire this thing is getting on your
nerves better forget it and stay to supper
-i caught three fine bass today

  i must be getting home he said i
dont like to be away long when the wilder-
ness is so dry

  as he spoke one of the town boys came
racing down the road in his automobile

  big fire up in the flats he yelled as he
stopped the lookout at point betsie tele-
phoned he says the fire is this side of the
platt and spreading rapidly

  ben who scorned automobiles and never
had ridden in one sprang across the yard
and leaped into the machine

  get me as close as you can he ordered
wait for me i called grabbing a cap
it was three miles from the cottage to the
crest of the range of hills and as the little
machine reeled and lurched over the un-
even road ben urged the boy to greater and
greater speed we crested the ridge and
stopped gazing over the wilderness

  a strong gusty breeze was blowing from
the northwest spreading a high haze of
smoke over the flats but presently a cur-
tain of lighter colored smoke seemed lifting
and falling on the tree-tops and in places
flame shot upward through the thick pall

  as if resting upon the tree-tops was a dull
glare and in the middle distance a huge
dead pine rising over the lower trees flamed
like a torch the acrid smell of burning
wood and leaves came stronger and stronger
as the gusty wind moved the smoke curtain

  to the west the sun was setting blood
red as seen through the deep smoke mist

  shes a terror said the boy awed by
the grandeur

  go on as far as we can ben ordered
the light machine ricketed over the hill
past long lake and plunged down into the
tree tunnel the air was clear here and
even the scent of the fire was missing
although high above us the spreading
smoke pall brought the darkness more


adventure

quickly for two miles we rushed on-
ward

  the smoke was beginning to settle lower
we could smell fire now ahead in the tun-
nel between the trees smoke poured as
through a chimney and presently the boy
strangling and coughing brought the ma-
chine to a halt ben leaped out

  go back he ordered im going on
you mustnt ben i said you
could not save the house now

  to - with the house said ben

lunds kids are in there

  without another word he plunged for-
ward into the tree tunnel his head held
low running rapidly with the easy ground-
gaining gait of the woodsman

  the boy and i retreated to the hill and
watched as night fell slowly giving ground
as the smoke became denser fire-lighters
volunteers led by the rangers were rushing
forward to battle with the flames at
midnight a lurid half - light covered the
entire wilderness but the breeze died and
then blew gently from the south

  weary fire-fighters returning for rest and
refreshment reported that the rangers were
holding their own and that from the north
empire had rushed rescuers while from the
east beulah and honor citizens were bat-
tling to restrict the area

all night the boy and i waited for
word from ben and in the morning
we went forward to the fighting
lines the fire still was raging but was
hemmed in now on three sides and great
gaps in the forest showed where the axes
and the back fires had stopped the spread
of the flames there was nothing to do but
wait until rain brought relief or the fire
burned itself out and left miles of the wilder-
ness a blackened desolation

  in the afternoon the fire-fighters reached
the lund clearing house and barn were
smoldering ruins three-quarters of a
mile away bens buildings stood scarcely
touched the fire had swept along both
sides of the clearing doing little damage
but in the clearing not a trace of human
life could be found ben had not succeeded
in reaching his own home nor had the lunds
escaped in that direction

  exhausted and with hope almost aban-
doned i joined the anxious ones waiting at
the life-saving station on point betsie
late in the afternoon a message telephoned

by a circuitous route around the burning
area brought fresh hope traces had been
found of ben and lund they had been
cut off from escape in direction of bens
clearing and had made their way to the
platt river clothing cast aside in the
stream indicated that they had reached
the water in safety

  fire still raged on both sides of the short
river timber heavier than that that lined
the stream further back was blazing wheth-
er ben and the lunds had attempted to
ascend the river to reach safety in platt lake
three miles above or had tried to descend to
lake michigan no one knew either way
they would be compelled to run the gant-
let of fire which in places arched tire
narrow river

  searching parties in boats already were on
platt lake seeking the fugitives five of
us inspired by hope of rescue launched one
of the old litc-boats and straining upon the
oars drove it along the lake michigan
shore toward the mouth of the platt
tall trees on shore burned like beacons
here and there the fire still raged in thickets
but the lighter underbrush had been burned
off and the fire was dying out

  our eyes searched the beaches and the
dunes as we drove the boat forward just
outside the surf of the bars but no trace of
human life was discernible foxes wild
with fear ran down the sand and plunged
into the water to draw back and whimper-
caught between two terrors rabbits hud-
dled close to the quaking foxes as if seek-
ing companionship here and there por-
cupines waddled along near the waters
edge in clumsy panic

  we rowed over the sandbar that guards
the mouth of the platt and waited pres-
ently the breeze lifted the smoke curtain a
trifle and we pulled into the mouth of the
river and gazed into the mouth of a furnace
the banks of the stream piled with the
tangle of long-dead logs glowed sullen red
and a few feet above the surface of the
water the smoke hung black and heavy

  it seemed that no living thing could run
that gantlet fifty yards into the river
we rowed and were driven back by heat
and smoke at dusk we surrendered hope

  we were preparing to row back to the
life-saving station to await news from the
rivers mouth when there emerged from the
mouth of the furnace a strange figure-the
figure of a man blackened hairless with
throw it over on john lund



tattered shreds of burned doth hanging
from his shoulders

  he was waist-deep in water when first
we saw him every few feet he stumbled
fell disappeared for an instant emerged
and advanced his progress was a series
of fallings forward

  ben we shouted and drove the boat
forward again

  he did not hear us but pitched forward
struggled a moment and lay lialf-sub-
merged in a shallow

  a moment later we reached out eager
hands two of us leaped from the boat to
lift him from the water-and saw the cause
of his stumbling progress he was towing
a rude raft by a towline made from the
vine of the wild grape the raft was com-
posed of dead logs tied together with vines
and upon this raft were the bodies of yim
lund and his two children lund and the
younger boy were unconscious the older
boy half conscious was lashed to the back
of the strange raft

  an hour later all four were in cots at the
life-saving station and trained hands were
dressing their burns and wounds

ben had reached the lund clear-
ing to find his foes fighting hope-
lessly trying to save their home
he had fought with them until the fire
reached the buildings and they found them-
selves cut off from bens clearing the
younger boy had fallen exhausted by the
heat and the exertion

  carrying the unconscious boy ben had
led the retreat to the river twice they
fought their way through the fire curtain
itself and finally threw themselves into
the water

  all night standing and crouching in the
river they fought for life ben and lund
taking turns supporting the unconscious
boy at daybreak the fire around them
grew less but the smoke hung low and they
breathed at the surface of the river then
ben started to make the raft by dragging
logs that had escaped the fire because they
were stranded at the waters edge they
planned to push the raft up-stream to platt
lake but when it was finished found them-
selves too weak to propel it against the
current so turned down-stream toward
lake michigan

  the unconscious boy and his exhausted

brother were placed upon the raft and the
two old enemies pushed and dragged the
raft down the swirling river between walls
of fire sparks and at times large pieces
of burning wood fell upon and around them
sizzling in the water or searing their flesh
they threw water upon the children and
ben removed his coat soaked it with water
and covered their faces twice burning
trees fell across the river and almost barred
the path at noon they had passed the
worst of the fire

  in mid-afternoon they heard the roar of
lake michigans surf piling upon the bars
at the rivers mouth safety seemed at
hand but lund could go no further in
vain ben urged and threatened lund
fell in the water and could not rise ben
lifted him to save him from drowning
for an hour they lay upon a little sandbar
in the river waiting for lund to regain
strength then ben scented fresh danger
the wind had changed and he knew that
the fire might come roaring back through
the dense cedar swamp that had been
scarcely touched

  he succeeded in reviving one of the boys
and together they rolled lund upon the
raft and lashed him to it his weight
submerged the raft until all its occupants
were in danger of being drowned ben had
solved this difficulty by lashing the older
boy to the rear of the raft so that his weight
would lift the forward end and hold the
heads of the others above the surface

  during the last mile bens mind was not
clear how many times he had struggled
to his feet fallen forward and dragged the
raft a few yards he did not know

  two days after we brought them to
point betsie station a heavy rain washed
the flats clean and the breezes swept
away all save the scent of dead smoke it
was a week before i saw ben again i
knew he and the lunds were recovering
one morning as i prepared for fishing ben
came down the road his hair was gone
his face was disfigured with bandages and
plasters but his blue eyes were glad and
laughing in his bandaged hands he
carricd a double-bitted ax

  come on over and help start a shack for
yim lund he said

  and as i looked at him in surprise he
laughed and said-

  feuds over

el cay de los quatros hombres

        like herrings cured in sun and wind
          the four lie side by side

        dry as a husk of coco-rind
        above the creaming tide

                              buccaneer ballades

     kurtler tom was the man who
discovered them and gave name
to the islet he had beached his
sloop fn the leeward lagoon the
better to calk a leaking seam and found
them lying on the sand just above tide
reach the desiccated rinds of what had
once been human beings mummified dis-
torted husks of shriveled skin and flesh and
bone their bleaching skulls wisped with hair
a few discolored rags flapping about the
pitiful remnants

  what tortures had forerun the giving up
of their ghosts on this arid shoal that thrust
itself above the blue bermudan waters
tom could well imagine there was- no
water on the cay no shaide no growth but
scanty herbage and brown palmetto scrub
that survived between the rains by some
miracle he looked for identification traces
in the shreds of personal belongings and
found none

  dead of hunger and of thirst tom
said to his carib sailor what brought
them here there is no wreckage

  then his foot kicked up an object buried
in the sand and wind-drift he stooped
and picked it up

  it was a boarding-pistol of unusual design

forged of the same strip to which the trigger-
guard was attached and deep-set in the
wooden frame of the barrel was a heavy
blade machete- shaped sickle-curving a
formidable weapon for close quarters after
the discharge of the pan-primed powder
and bullet a thing designed by the genius
of deviltry

  turtler tom had seen this pattern before
though it was rare those days the recent
invention of a buccaneer scourge of the
caribbean his moody eyes gleamed as
he hefted the cunningly balanced weapon
by its carved grip

  marooned poor devils marooned by
tong tom pugh he exclaimed one
of his bullies dropped it from his belt
likely and it got shuffled under the sand
come tampi well bury whats left of em
turtler tom bore the news of his grisly
find with him back to providence and to
port royal and all along his devious water
wanderings but the score of long tom
pugh was a long one and los quatros hombres
lay beneath the weather-fluted sands on the
cay that bore their name as only epitaph
unrecognized though doubtless not un-
mourned

chapter ii

the mercy of long tom pugh

the chase had been a long one and long
tom pugh raged like a thwarted devil
from dawn until a scant half-hour of sun-
set pughs schooner had trailed the other

maroonefl

a complete
ovelette

author of the sign of the skull the bully etc


the marooner



both vessels tacking on long reaches with
canvas set until their tall masts bent like
whips and their lee rails were gutters of
foam

  foot by foot pughs scourge had over-
hauled the fugitive until the weapon from
which pugh got his name the long tom
couched in the bows had found first its
range and then its target so that now the
trader lay wallowing in the choppy seas off
the tiny cay hull riddled foremast gone
its decks a clutter of rope and canvas that
served as shrouds to live of its crew that the
last charge of partridge had dismembered
and disemboweled three men stood near
the stern weary blood-stained helpless
yet defiant watching pughs longboat
crowded with his bullies dance over the
water to take them off

  a murrain on the luck said pugh
a stinking shell-pedler and i thought
it a gold-carrier from the plate and we
short of powder but theyll pay for it the
dogs

  he cupped his hands and bellowed across
the crisp waves

  bring em away and let her sink blast
her the winds ashift

  the hair upon pughs broad and naked
chest was black save where a streak of
white marked where a cutlas slash had
sliced his brisket but the hair of his head and
of his long beard was dyed a rusty purple as
if it were stained with dried blood his
fierce face deep-tanned deep-scored was
split by a great bony nose like the beak of
a macaw with nostrils that were narrow
slitted and twitched as he watched the
progress of his boat one black eye had
pugh and one of hazel and from both of
them the devil looked out as it leaned on
elbows across the sill of his brain never
free from the fume of liquor and never
seemingly affected by it

  he was bare to his belt that was studded
with pistols tucked into a gaudy over-sash
and to which swung a hanger in a leather
scabbard wide pantaloons were thrust
into wider sea-boots of leather and he stood
with his legs wide apart and his furry hands
upon his hips almost alone of all his
crew of forty ruffians who overcrowded the
capacity of the scourge pugh wore no
earrings the lobe of one brown ear lopped
in twain where some desperate foe had tom
away the ornament his teeth were natur-
ally divided and pugh had filed them in the

manner of the madagascar savages the
better to characterize his evil countenance

  the sim dropped rapidly and the sinking
schooner swashed about in water that was
incarnadined with the sunset nine of
pughs bullies were in the longboat now
returning with the three prisoners forty-odd
watched at the rail or made ready for the
tack to come for the fickle days-end wind
was setting them down to the shoals that
outribbed from the cay

  the three men were set aboard their arms
pinioned behind their backs and shoved aft
to where pugh stood agrin they were of
varying age and stature and one was bald
save for a fringe of hair but there seemed
some link of related features common to all
of them and they looked pugh fairly in the
face though the blood was running into the
eyes of one of them from a scalp-wound

  so said pugh ye thought to out-
sail the scourge in that coffm-box of
yours

  the bald man answered

  we could not fight we had no wea-
pons to match yours

  then ye would have fought priest-face
eh ye would have fought with pugh
ill fight with ye now an ye let one arm
free answered the other composedly

  pughs face grew purple with a rush of
choleric blood he whipped a pistol from
his belt and leveled it the hammer slowly
cocking to the pull of his finger then he
lowered the weapon

  sink ye for a bragging fool he said
but i will not kill in cold blood i must
remember my vow i am a merciful man
yet ye crow well what is your name
we be three graemes

  pugh glanced to where the yellow letter-
ing on the pitching stern of the wallowing
vessel showed the name three brothers and
nodded

  of nassau turtlers

  aye our port is nassau but we are
carolinans

  so what know ye of the schooner
belle isle bound from the river plate
she should be hereabouts speak up
naught nor would i tell ye an i did
say ye so look ye graeme i am a
merciful man and ye are a fool to be
stubborn standing on the edge of trouble
it is in my mind that ye are lying so i
give ye another chance tell me what ye
know of the belle isle and join my crew


adventure

we can find room for all of ye and a full
share apiece if ye come willingly

  silence hung for a few seconds

  no still stubborn then we but
waste time brethren three into the boat
with them pugh ordered as a stronger
gust set the scourge to shivering where
she swung in the eye of the wind uneasy
and restive her keen bows pawing the
waves give them the usual provender
and set them on the cay

  for the first time something like anxiety
showed in the faces of the trio

  ye would not maroon us on yon cay
said the eldest graeme tis waterless
man twill be worse than murder it

means-

  a fig for what it means said pugh
ye will shortly find that out and i am
a merciful man graeme i am sending
meat and drink

  the brothers exchanged glances it
was as if they nodded acquiescense with
their eyes the bald-headed one spoke

  theirmay god curse ye for a murderer
and a coward long tom pugh he said
may ye come at your end to linger till
your tongue grows to the roof of your mouth
and your belly shrivels may your soul
shred out into the darkness and whine in
the winds for mercy

  he suddenly shot out neck and head and
spat full in the buccaneers face

  pugh turned livid and his eyes became
points of fire he snatched the scarlet
bandanna from the head of one of liis
crew and wiped his face and beard then
flung the gaudy silk overboard where the
wind snatched at it and whirled it far astern

  ye are a cunning knave graeme he
said and his voice held hate and breathed
it as an iron holds heat i would that i
had time to handle ye aright yet before
ye die ye will wish a hundred times that i
had shot ye as ye would have me do over
with them ye will find company ashore
graeme ask the four i left there a while
ago to play hosts to ye 

  and speed back he called to the quar-
termaster in the stem of the longboat
these are tricky waters ah look at
that

  the foundering schooner had taken her
last sudden plunge and disappeared but
her maintop spar protruded from the water
warning of a shoal toward which wind and
sea were slowly backing the scourge

  well pick ye up outside roared pugh
let her come up pay off there star-
board tack

  lie leaped to the wheel active as a tiger
for all his bulk and laid a guiding-hand to
the spokes to aid the helmsman the
lithe schooner gathered way and hurled
herself ahead as she caught the wind in the
shallow hollows of her sails close-hauled
fighting free from the threatening reefs and
bars the longboat sped to the shore
tumbling out the three graemes hurling
after them two kegs one of which fell short
and swashed about in the tide fringe till
two of them retrieved it

  the boat went racing back after the
scourge as clear of shoals it once more
hung in the wind the bullies clambered
aboard and left the longboat riding to a
line to lunge after the schooner like a leap-
ing dog after its master then the sun fell
below the horizon and darkness jumped up
from its ambush beyond the rim of the sea

  presently a spark of light appeared on the
leeward side of the cay and grew to a crack-
ling radiance as the crisp palmetto fans
flared up about the fire squatted the three
brothers their faces grim in the ruddy glow
as they took counsel

  i would not care so much save for
margaret said willgraeme the youngest
of the three the babe was to come this
week i had thought to be at home
and a spasm contracted his features

  take heart lad said john graeme the
bald-headed we will win through aye
and settle accounts with long tom pugh
the rains are not so far off a month at
most we can eke out we will fret
not will the child will be bom ere she be-
gins to worry over ye but we must go
carefully just keep the life in us till the
rains come or we sight some ship may-
hap well get enough from the wreck to
build some sort of craft

  the current swings about the cay
said alec graeme there was no drift-
wood on the beach and we were chased by
the scourge far off the travel lanes ye
heard what pugh said about company
how he left four here this is quatros
hombres cay where turtler tom buried
them that pugh marooned

  yet we will win through said john
graeme ill handle the rations alec
see if the water-keg is full we can do with-
out tonight
the marooner



  tis but a double anker grumbled
alec graeme as he rolled the keg closer to
the fire and john graeme did the same with
the barrel of meat now may the flesh
rot on his bones while he lives in anguish
cried alec passionately this is no water
anker tk brandy and the other bully
beef the lying grinning devil with his
talk of mercy brandy and salted meat
and the rains a month away

chapter iii

the inn at porto bello

   oh sing me a song of a rover

     a tale of the spanish main

   of a buccaneer living in clover

     and drink to the jolly refrain

   ho yo ho as blade as a crow
     is the flag the bullies sail under

  to long tom pugh and his rollicking crew
    and the roar of his carronades thunder

   ho yo ho for the swing of the surge

     show me a schooner as swift as the scourge

   gallant and free are the men of the sea
     who sail under long tom the wonder

they beat out the time of the tune with
their rummers and mugs on the
scarred tables while their crimson faces
loomed through the blue haze of the to-
bacco-smoky low-ceilinged room like sun-
dogs through a mist the song ended and
pugh tossed a couple of gold pieces to the
singer who spun them with a flick of thumb
and finger and roared for more liquor

  there were twenty rowdy blousy wenches
muslecs most of them bred of full whites
and quadroons olive-skinned and flushed
with their portions of the tankards thrust
upon them by the pirates who shared them
each woman with either arm about a buc-
caneer ogling cajoling for a dividend of the
freely spent lightly gained gold present-
ly the wail of violins joined in a pulse-
quickening hornpipe there was a scuffle
for partners half-jovial half-ugly and a
score of couples thrust back chairs and
tables and swung and lurched upon the
sand-gritted floor

  long tom pugh and his bullies were in
porto bello there were no hovering
kings ships to annoy and the town was
theirs as long as their gold lasted pugh
did not dance he sat apart with the
quartermaster of the scourge and his matq
and chief gunner his evil face seamed in a

smile that split his henna-stained whiskers

  im done said the quartermaster
glowering at the dice he had just cast
im clean as a whistle curse the bones
theres the devils own luck in them

  there should be answered pugh as he
scooped in the stake they are shaped
from the thigh-bone of the man roaring
raines left to guard his treasure-chest when
he buried it on ransom cay raines
buried it and i found it with the skeleton
of the poor devil he took ashore to do the
digging sprawled atop of the chest raines
didnt figure on the shifting dunes

  we got hold of a member of his crew
and persuaded him to tell which cay raines
chose to leave the loot on he told us
what he knew and luck did the rest the
wind had blown the sand and there was the
hand of raines grave-digger sticking up
like a sign-post beckoning us to come and
get even with roaring dick and my
bosun shaped me the dice try your own
man come youve a ring there i fancy
ill stake a gold doubloon against it

  the quartermaster hesitated then drew
the ring from his finger it was of crude
workmanship fashioned to form a snake of
gold with a flawed emerald set in the flat
of the head and two diamond chips for the
eyes

   ill set it against five and no less he
said

  three and no more answered pugh and
piled the stake a minute later and he
stuck it on his own hairy digit

  the quartermaster smothered his re-
sentful oath in his tankard

  where did ye loot the ring asked
pugh twisting it about i do not recol-
lect seeing it in the sharing

   i got it from a wench lied the quarter-
master

  he had taken it from the finger of will
graeme when he had bound his arms be-
hind him and in this he the chosen
representative of the crew in the division of
spoils had cheated but the lie passed

   she gave it ye for your handsome face i
suppose said pugh and the others at the
table laughed for the quartermasters face
was pox-pitted so that his features seemed
to have crumbled

a winners jests come easy he growled
and the look he gave pugh was murderous

the scrape of the fiddles and the shuffling
of feet ended and once more the sweating


adventure

servers scurried about replenishing the
empty mugs a fight over a girl broke out
in a corner and the mustce ran squealing
from the grappling men

  bring em out in the open bawled
pugh

  with all the blood-lust in them flaming
from the liquor they had swigged a dozen
men hustled out the combatants to the open
space between the tables

  take away their knives ordered pugh
ill lose no good men for the sake of a
worthless wench a doubloon to the win-
ner

  left to themselves the two pirates
roaring like bulls rushed at each other
swinging arms like flails locked swayed
and fell together to the floor one got
astride of the other and gripped his throat
while the under mans knees played a tattoo
against his back and he squirmed like a seal
the topmost lost his balance and they rolled
over and apart to scramble to their feet
amid the yells of their comrades

  there was no science to it and much
comedy for one was squat and bow-legged
and the other lanky and gangling but
the latter bashed the short one in the face
with a straight left so that his nose seemed
to split like a rotten pear and the blood
spurted the squat man bellowed grabbed
his long opponent about the buttocks and
sent him hurtling over his shoulder to
smash against the table-leg with his
head

  the unsound support splintered at the
impact and the table pitched forward with
all its contents while the room echoed with
ribald laughter the lanky man lay stunned
and was hauled out by his feet to have a
tankard of ale dashed in his face as the vic-
tor advanced to pugh for his doubloon

  a door had opened in the rear and a girl
came in whose appearance drew the swift
attention of those nearest to her halting
their jesting and buffoonery to a silence
that rapidly spread so that she advanced in
a strained quietude to the center of the
sanded space where she stood for a moment
before she gave a nod to the fiddlers and
began to dance

  she danced like a reed in the wind
swaying with infinite grace of posture
her feet scarce leaving a circle less than
that of an ordinary platter she was tall
and lissom though full-busted and she
looked like a half-opened flower fresh un-

smirched with paint and holding an air of
aloofness that was eery

  her dark gray eyes almost violet at times
in the uncertain lights seemed to gaze far
beyond the tavern walls she danced as
one might dance at will on the sea-sands
as a nymph might dance strangely in-
congruous in that assembly of gross-
passioned men unconscious of her sur-
roundings her golden hair was coiffed
in classic simplicity and her sable draperies
were at odd variance with the tawdry
gauds of the mustees who viewed her with
palpable disfavor yet shared the silent
concentration of the buccaneers

  the air the fiddlers played was soft and
low a crooning rhythm that sounded like
the murmur of surf after a storm or a
breeze playing amid young birches and
as she danced to the masterful masterless
men about her came visions of spring
woods where hyacinths and primrose clus-
tered of brooks winding amid lush sedges
all set in the far-off days of their own
innocence

  the rhythm changed and she floated
round the room light as thistle-down or a
foam-bell her eyes passing over the rough
seamed faces with no hint that she regarded
them as indices of humanity hypnotizing
them by the sheer beauty of her dance
then she snapped her fingers to the players
and they swung their bows to a wild
tarantelle the violet eyes became black
sudden roses flashed out on her cheeks her
posturing became of the flesh rather than
the spirit provocative yet so infinitely
graceful that it still held the audience in
thrall though their heads swayed to
the increasing lilt and their pulses
pounded

  she was no longer a foam bell but a
curling wave that leaped upcurving crest-
ing to the very feet and then swept back
in furious eddies that bewildered with their
whirl

  a fiddle-string snapped she stopped
ivory arms flung back audacious chal-
lenging as a shower of coins fell upon the
floor and one of the pirates snatching a
tambourine from his quondam consort
gathered up the gold and humbly offered
it to her as she courtesied low before long
tom pugh whose eyes were ablaze and
whose beaked nose showed its ridge of bone
as the nostrils twitched and dilated and the
great chest lifted and fell
the marooner



he rose sweeping the table aside
and in one great stride reached
and raised her crushing her to him
while his bearded lips sought hers then
he drew back with an oath as she twisted
free and stood less at bay than ready for
attack a dagger she had drawn  from
between her breasts flashing in her hand
her eyes holding pughs while one of his
great paws fumbled at his beard where
blood was oozing its way through the mat
of hair just beneath the line of his chin

  all breaths were held sensing the verge
of tragedy but pugh still fumbling at his
beard slowly retreated until his other hand
back-stretched f it the edge of the table
he had pushed aside his eves no longer
blazing but ablink were fixed on those
of the dancer and as he leaned against the
support he shivered

  she is a witch he muttered look
at her eyes they are not human by
god she missed my jugular by an inch
she would have let the life out of me

  and still the room hung on the scene
marveling to see pugh so strangely tamed
yet conscious of the weird power of the
woman pughs hand fetched up against
a rummer and tightened about it he
lifted it and chained the raw cafia it con-
tained as he set it down the dancers
gaze suddenly fastened on the ring he had
won from the quartermaster

  she seemed to stiffen in a sinuous pose
while the arm that held the dagger glided
like a white-skinned snake back in an
almost imperceptible movement that pre-
saged a lightning thrust it came but
only to sheath the knife between her
breasts once more and she laughed

  know ye not ye must not touch me
she asked and her voice clear as a bell
seemed to come from afar off like the sound
of a distant chime ye must not touch
me for i am death she said i am
the white death and this dress is the
shroud of love her eyes absolutely
fearless burned in their absolute belief
of what she spoke to pughs brain and to
all in that still silent room the light
in them was uncanny as if the soul no longer
reigned behind them in its seat they were
lambent with the high glaze of madness
and they held pugh as a snake charms a
bird

  you are death he muttered she
nodded

  but you need not fear me yet she said
i have not harmed you only warned
you did i not dance for you and you
sought to take me know ye not that it is
death who comes for you

  she advanced her hand and the great
bulk of pugh cowered he crossed himself
and many of his men did likewise

  where got ye that coiling ring about
your finger she asked

   he took it off and offered it to her

  take it he said take it and go
there is blood on it she answered
pugh looked shudderingly at the circlet
and laid it on the table not realizing it was
his own gore from the fingers thathad
pressed his neck that stained it

  it is yours he said shortly take it
nay i have not yet earned it nor
have ye told me its history surely it has
a history mayhap it was a love-pledge
once upon a lime tell me then i
will sing for ve and so i shall have earned
it

  i know naught of it said pugh i
won it but now from him

  he nodded at the quartermaster and the
womans eyes scrutinized the pitted face
for an instant

  ye shall tell me presently she said
and smiled

  and with her smile the dread that had
stiffened the face of the quartermaster
passed and he grinned at her with yellow
teeth the witch had turned siren and his
vicious blood responded

  ill spin the yam he said i am not
so timid as others and he glanced
sneeringly at pugh who had sat down
and was shading his eyes with his hand

  no she asked then why do ye
make the holy symbol for the pirates
bundled fingers still touched his tunic above
his heart he who woos death does not
always win yet death is kind

  she stepped back and commenced to
sing

             where lies he now

lost love of mine

             his marble brow

is creased with brine

               his lips caressed
                 are chill and gray

            how warm they pressed
               the other day

             his body swings
               to shifting tide

              no twilight brings
              him to his bride
io

adventure

            yet do i know
            our tender vow
            shall ever bind

    as then so now

   when fails my breath

when life grows dim

    ill thank grim death
    for finding him

  it was a dirge that changed into a pajan
of joy while she sang there v as not a soul-
calloused sea-rover not a hardened drab
but sighed to the memory or the lost hope
of love tender gallant and enduring not
one but thrilled to the credence of the last
triumphant lines in a spell they sat as
she took the ring and glided from the room
the tambourine with its golden offerings
untouched

  then pugh shook off the mood that
compassed him

  go bring her back he ordered
fiend take me but ill teach the jade
ill take her aye and break her till she
sighs for death rot me up and after her
i say

  no one moved till the quartermaster
with a contemptuous look at pugh got up

  ill find her he said but ill not
promise to bring her back

  pugh started up coughed and set a swift
hand to his mouth the stab had pierced
through to his throat and his mouth had
filled with blood as his anger quickened
its flow and the quartermaster catching
up the tambourine as he went vanished
into the night outside

  the tavern-keeper came hurrying with a
bowl of water and a pannikin of rough salt
pugh swallowed his own blood and waved
him aside

   tis no hemorrhage fool he said
only a scratch unless he added
half to himself and his ruddy face paled
the witch poisoned it

  best let me fetch a leech said the
tavern-keeper indeed i know little of
the wench save she is a bit mad she
comes from nassau some say she has an
infant she lost her man at sea and it
crazed her but this is hearsay she has
danced here and elsewhere and sings among
the sailors seeking news of her man yet
she seems not to know her own name
and she was ever harmless until now

  i have a leech of my own said pugh
if the fool is sober so folsom here ye
are take a look at this slit the she-devil
put in me where is the quartermaster

  gone after the witch said the dis-
credited medico who had joined the out-
laws of the scourge

  may she slash his weasand agape
said pugh we would be well rid of
both of them what think ye of the
wound	-

  i think tis clean some ointment and a

stitch maybe-

  then come off to the schooner lads
we sail on the flood close after dawn i
have news of a gold-ship and he added
as he left the tavern with the leech if she
bewitches the quartermaster well sail
without him he is too solid with the men
now for my liking

  as they went down the beach the chorus
broke out again behind them muffled by
the closing door

   ho yo ho as black as a crow

     is the flag we bullies sail under

  to long tom pugh and his rollicking crew
    and the roar of our carronades thunder

chapter iv

margaret graeme

tt is hard to say if margaret graeme
was mad perhaps it was merely the
passing fever of a brain lit by the exaltation
of one great concentration of purpose bred
of a mating love and hope-the finding of
her man will graeme had promised to
be back for the birth of their son no ordi-
nary circumstance would have held him

  now he was two months overdue and
for six weeks she had been seeking news
of him bending her will to the best ways
and means of cajoling sailormen the use
of her beauty of her voice and of her grace
so used as to keep herself inviolate for will
so had grown in her a wondrous cunning
coupled to her gifts of dance and song that
had bubbled up within the sweet fountain
of her body in the happy days of love and
mating

  she had thought of the boucatiiers
there were other perils of the deep but
it was not yet the season of hurricanes
and the three brothers was a stanch and
speedy craft while alec and john and will
formed a trio of mariners who were innate
masters of the sea rather than doomed
to be its playthings in her six weeks of
flitting from port to por-t she had heard
more than once of quatros hombres cay
the marooner



and the way of long tom pugh and others
of his calling

  earlier pirates had been different men
big in a crude way moved by fits of cruelty
or generosity as the mood swayed them
sometimes they would kill kill for the sheer
joy of blood-letting drunk with the fight
the reek of powder and the drive of blade
or point through elastic flesh and stubborn
bone and again they would give some
gallant foe his ship after they had glutted
their fancies from the cargo or send the
survivors adrift in an open boat to take their
chance of landing after having sworn them
not to inform

  but pugh and his ilk took no chances
they were marooners leaving their victims
on desert cays to perish destroying all
witnesses yet styhng themselves merciful

  and margarets grief-shocked brain had
determined that buccaneers had taken her
will and his brothers true the three
brothers hull held nothing worth the rifling
but she had the heels of the trading fleet
and the pirates were apt at changing to a
faster or sounder vessel than their own
on these lines margaret had hidden her
identity asking rather than leading up to
information listening piecing together
charming her crews and selecting by her
womans wits the natural chiefs among
them

  even the child came second with her
on her wanderings went a coal-black west
indian negress a giantess in size and
strength a child in loyalty and admiration
of her golden-haired mistress who played
nurse to the infant and guardian to the
mother

  margaret knew when she left the tavern
that the pox-pitted quartermaster would
follow her it was the compelling urge
of her sex grown to its utmost power in
the hothouse of her love that called to
such rough spirits yet held their coarseness
in check by the purity of her own spirits
flame she was a circe and she bent mens
passions and wills as one might weave
osiers to a basket

  as the quartermaster the hot blood
flooding his brain to one mad desire that
was only tempered by a certain dread
emerged tambourine in hand its golden
coins jingling slightly on the taut parch-
ment out from the heated tavern into the
quiet night he saw between the interlacing
shadows of the palms upon the shell road



silver where the moon lustered it the
figure of the dancer vague uncertain
almost ghostly in the checkered light that
shifted with the play of the land wind in
the plumes of coco-palms she had a
mantilla about her head but he caught
the gleam of her eyes as she glanced his
way and marked the play of her beckoning
hand

  involuntarily he crossed himself then
swore at his own weakness with a crude
sea-oath and followed her in his lurching
deck-gait followed for she glided ahead
without ever looking back on beyond the
clustering houses of the port on to where
a path led through the sea-bush she went
fast and the quartermaster his heart
pounding a devils jig against the cage of
his ribs lunged after striving in vain to
gain without breaking into a run from
which the same latent tugging fear at the
back of his inflamed brain prevented him

  they came into a scanty clearing where
a mud cabin stood and a little stream flowed
from the hills and spent itself in the sand
an owl hooted and the quartermaster
checked his pace at the omen it might
be the witchs familiar but he was a
slow-witted man save in the practise of
his calling and the strength of his body
and the triumph of a hundred personal
skirmishes had endowed him with a sturdy
belief in his own prowess that built up a
dogged courage born of the flesh rather
than the mind ilis purpose once set he
would hold to it and he followed

  lights glowed suddenly in the two
visible windows of the little cabin and he
saw the door open as the woman reached
the threshold and turning for the first time
drew aside her mantilla showed him the
witching oval of her face with its gleaming
eyes and with the tiniest beckon of her
head passed in

  there was but one room in the low-
roofed place by the light of two brass
lamps burning whale-oil he saw that it was
empty saw too that the only other door
at the back was barred on the inside
there was little furniture a low bed
stood behind a screen and near the pillows
he saw what seemed a small bundle under-
neath the coverlet

  who then had opened the door or lit the
lamps he felt the hair rising at the nape
of his neck and the incipient goose-quills
lifting down his spine his hands tapped
adventure

the pistol butts in his belt and the handles
of his dirks and the swift wish came to him
that he had a silver witch-bullet in the
muzzle of one of the former

ran but the woman had turned and

i s radiantly alluring pointed to a
la  l rough chair in which he sat even
while he felt little cold beads break out
upon his brow beneath his headkerchief
a slight draft caused him to slightly turn
his head and roll his eyeballs toward the
door through which he had just entered
it was slowly closing of its own volition
the dancer was holding out a pewter mug
toward him

  it is cana she said i will pledge
you first

  she sipped a little and swallowed it he
could see the moisture of the liquor on her
crimson lips and he took the mug and
drained it the ardent stuff fired him
his eyes became bloodshot and he leaned
toward her swaying a trifle like an amorous
bear god but she was beautiful white
-and tender and sweet but some tingling
touch of restraint still thralled him

  what if i should take you mistress
he uttered in a deep guttural

  she surveyed him unafraid with her
shining eyes they held a hint of amuse-
ment

  you would be dead long before the
dawn she said and the utter conviction
of her voice hammered home to him the
feeling that she spoke sooth

  did i not tell you i was death she
almost crooned i could kill you in a
hundred ways so very easily they say
i am a witch you think so as you sit
there wouldst see my familiar look
at the window

  swiftly she lowered the wicks of the two
lamps till they barely showed the moon-
light came in at one window and made a
wedge-path to where the quartermaster
sat the path began some two feet from
the window where the shadow of the wall
below the sill ended it was very white
and luminous squared off by the woodwork
of the panes

  slowly a blotch began to eclipse its
brightness a drumming noise commenced
and quickened as the blotch enlarged
and the pulse of the mariner beat faster
until it seemed as if the sound were that
of the blood flowing through his own

veins then suddenly a face leered in
at the window

  the face of a demon livid emitting a
pale lambency that set off a great grinning
mouth set with pointed tusks between
which lolled the tip of a lusting tongue
staring eyeballs floating in white circles
wide nostrils eagerly agape and crisp hair
that seemed alive with mysterious lights
the skin was black like that of a devil from
the pit and it appeared fungused with the
phosphorescence of decay it blotted out
the moonlight and shone by its own
radiance

  santa maria this dancer was no
woman she was a ghoul a succubus
the quartermaster snatched a pistol from
his belt and pulled trigger by some
mischance the powder had fallen from the
pan and it missed fire but his brain gave
no such ordinary explanation the face
was still there and by the living god
a snake was twining through the tresses
he flung himself at the door that opened
outward it was of solid hardwood and
it resisted his heavy thrust as if it had been
of iron

  behind him the dancer laughed he
turned sweat clammy on him at bay
fumbling for a knife the lamps were
turned up again the face had gone

  sit down she said since ye can not
go sit down i mean ye no harm

 no harm then why-

  so ye should not harm yourself by
trying to harm me take more cana

  she handed him a fresh measure and took
a pipe from a stand filled it and handed
it to him with a paper spill that she had
lighted above the flame of her lamp
half-mechanically he drank the liquor and
accepted the pipe sitting down once more

  are ye human or what he asked
gaining false courage from the cana and
the homely elements of her hospitality
or have ye tricked me by the wounds
of gods son that head cast a shadow on
the floor twas no spirit

  he half rose

  wouldst try another pistol at it she
asked smiling or will ye go outside and
seek it the door is open now or closed
as i will but i am flesh and blood
see

  she took his rough hand in her smooth
one and set it on the warm satin of her
forearm the beast in him leaped to the
the marooner



front he sprang up coarse mouth open
eyes crimsoning his clutching hands apart

  sit down she said and her voice rang
like the crack of a trainers whip if ye
would win me ye must woo me sit down

  his half-befuddled brain obeyed the
dominance of her will and he crouched
rather than sat as an unwilling brute going
through a disliked performance

  she had said if would she come
willingly to him would she play an
obedient eager beauty to his beast if
only she would take her eyes off his she
might be human but those eyes were not
they made him blink as they had made
pugh blink yet she had preferred him
to pugh why not he was the better man
for all his ravaged face some day   

  ye are a brave man she was saying
ye have done brave things and ye will
do braver with my aid come ye were
going to tell me about this ring

  there may have been some subtle herb
steeped in the cana the negress voodoo-
worshiper who had so ably backed her
mistress by her startling apparition her
sooty face smeared with match-phosphorus
fireflies in her wool a harmless snake looped
in the kinks knew many secrets

  it was not the first time she had raised
a devil to her mistress conjuring using
such simple but not necessarily transparent
means as in the present case when she had
lit the lamps and swung the door at sight
of margarets approach backed by a sailor-
gaited man then descending through
the cellar-trap kept covered by a grass rug
she had emerged by the outer hatch to play
her demoniac role and set a prop against
the entrance door as she and her mistress
had planned for such emergency

  and it was small wonder that with the
setting the suggestion and eery atmosphere
that environed margaret the quarter-
master knowing nothing of the existence
of her sooty slave had deemed the appari-
tion supernatural

  perhaps margaret graemes stress of will
gave her hypnotic power the quarter-
master gazed upon the dull emerald and
the twinkling eyes of the golden snake and
felt his own will melting into a desire to
serve if she was circe he was caliban

  he had meant to lie about the ring to
spin some yarn redounding to his own
prowess but his words came aside from
his own volition and he spoke the truth

  there were three of them left all
brothers he said we chased them all
day thinking them a gold-ship from the
plate for there was one due in that neigh-
borhood the schooner was fast we
overhauled it at sunset and we sank it
we killed all the crew forard and amid-
ships with a round of partridge the
three brothers it was called their name
was graeme	

  we brought them aboard in the long-
boat i bound the youngest of them
and i took this ring from his finger as i
made it fast one was bald and he mocked
pugh who sent us ashore with them we
left them with a keg of salt-horse and an
anker of brandy pughs provender we
call it they are dead now and you have
the ring

  where did ye land them where
nay i know not i told ye we chased
them all day we took no sun that noon
nor did i check our bearings in the log
for pugh and i were at outs and i bunked
forard for a week before and since
somewhere to the southeast of the windard
isles

he had told all he knew in the
longboat he had not heard pugh
mention the four men set ashore
at a time when he himself had been ashore
at skull cay their own headquarters
recovering from fever and a bad shot-
wound nor did pugh himself know that
turtler tom had found the shriveled
men and styled the islet quatros hombres

  margaret repressed a sigh she was
balked of the pith of what she sought
even while she heard what caused her heart
to leap for will was still alive-she was
strangely confident of that he had been
on a barren cay for eight weeks nearly nine
for the quartermaster had said sunday
and the babe was born on thursday night
nine weeks with the food that was an ag-
gravation rather than sustaining the rains
had not yet come though they were overdue
but she was sure that her will her gallant
strong loving will would win through
as her love had made her do wonders so
his would help him to a miraculous preserva-
tion then there were john the canny
and alec the capable oh it was im-
possible to think of them perishing

  so now she bent her wits to locating
the cay somewhere southeast of the


adventure

windward islands was like saying some-
where in the haystack lies the needle  there
were hundreds of cays-no man yet knew
how many cays since the charts were
acknowledged vague-humping themselves
above the waves just awash arid isles of
the ocean desert

  but pugh knew and pugh must tell
pugh would be more difficult he was not
as plastic as his quartermaster quicker-
witted more-due to his imagination-of
a beast when aroused margaret swiftly
made up her mind to ply the quarter-
master of all he knew of pugh his ren-
dezvous his habits his next intentions
this she would take to the kings ship-
there was one expected soon at providence
and she would make her bargain news
of how to capture pugh in exchange for
information to be dragged from the pirate
as to the whereabouts of the cay on which
he had set the graemes she might go
farther and ask for passage on the kings ship

  yet this course-and she reasoned so
swiftly that the quartermaster knew naught
of her mental process-was uncertain
pugh might be killed in the fight and
the scourge had outsailed many a kings
ship she must have two strings to her
bow the quartermaster was her surest
method later would come the ultimate
revenge if aught really happened to her will

  while the shuttle of her mind shot
nimbly through the warp and woof of her
brain weaving in bright strands of hope
the land-wind swept down from the hills
in a sudden rush bringing with it the swift
patter of rain her heart leaped it was
a sign-a sign that before many hours the
seasons fall would be mercifully drenching
that scorched cay where will fought off death

  she turned to the quartermaster

  it is a pretty ring she said i am
sorry it has no stranger history or that we
do not know it thank you

 thank me not thank pugh or
rather thank no one you paid for it
with your dancing god it was like the
swaying of the seaweed in the lagoon pools
when the tide shifts and all the colored fish
swim in and out and that last it was
a flame see i forgot the gold they
gave ye

  he took up the tambourine with its
jingling coins from the table

  i need it not she said take it
ye can use it

  open-mouthed he goggled at her insist-
ence then pouched the gold

  ye care not for money he said in-
credulously

  not for coins they pass through a
thousand hands a hundred times a year
they are counters in the game i like
jewels i love jewels

  she sighed and looked at him with
deliberate languishment

  i have seen rare ones aye and owned
them he boasted i will get ye jewels
that have adorned princesses jewels from
sacred shrines jewels from the hilts of
chieftains swords i will outweigh thee

with jewels why look ye once-

  go on she said tell me of yourself
brave man

  there is no flattery so subtle as that of
desdemonas gift all the world loves a
ready listener and the quartermaster
talked until his own experience his own
limited invention and what he remembered
of the yams of others were combined in
his ulyssean tale ever and anon the
wind would rise to a gale with spit and slap
of rain that passed unnoticed by the teller
at last he paused and emptied the mug
she had kept replenished

  i knew you for an adventurous man
and a brave one simon hart she said
for he had told her his name you have
told me your past give me your hand
i will read ye the future

  then from his horny palm she conjured
a vision of success tinged with suggestions
to her own end that so accorded with
simon harts self-estimation that it knit
his will to achieve these things she read
and leavened his jealousy of pugh of any
master she cajoled him and held out hints
of reward until he swore by all the gods of
sea and land that she was a marvel and that
he would prove her so

  the men are with me he boasted
pugh is puffed up with pride and has forgot
his fellowship they are tired of seeing
him with the lions share and with their
smaller measure only harsh words he
would forbid them the freedom of the cabin
he would curb their shore liberty he calls
no conferences he gives only half an ear
to what i set before him

 the wind blows my way now and
when we have given him the black spot
when he is deposed and i rule and reap a
harvest of the caribbean wilt come with
the marooner

me to skull cay and queen it i will build
you a house and bring you mustee slaves
white slaves and black and i will be the
chiefest of them i will make pugh your
servant i will humble him as i will
elevate thee wilt come

  come back to me soon and tell me ye
have done these tilings we will reap the
harvest later prove to me you are a better
man than pugh bring him to me or me

to him-

  what want ye of pugh he asked with
sudden suspicion

  i hate him he tried to kiss my lips
he would have taken me by force i could
have killed him but i would rather see you
break him and then give him to me see
the lamps are wan the day breaks
simon hart leaped to his feet and looked
through the rain-streaked window at the
graying east

  we sail on the flood he said pugh
would go without me farewell

  he would have embraced her roughly
but she eluded him and a hintof struggling
rose stained the sky above the hills and
flushed the room

  farewell he cried again and left the
cabin running heavily across the clearing
margaret watched him with eyes from
which the glaze of fever had lifted to show
exaltation struggling with weariness and
saw him plunge into the bush path with
a hasty wave to her then she turned
back into the cabin and leaned above the
small bundle on the bed behind the screen

  babe babe she breathed softly
your father whom ye have never seen
and who has never seen your little straight
limbs and his own image in your eyes and
shape is coming home again

  and the pattering saving rains told the
beads of her prayers

  when the great negress came softly in
she found margaret graeme asleep on her
knees beside the bed continuing her grateful
petitions in her dreams

chapter v

fox and hounds

gor the third time the scourge with
mutiny mounting in the hearts of her
crew headed up for skull cay pughs
rendezvous in the delta of the river plate
for the third time the chagrined lookout

in the top saw through his glass the
kings ship in the offing visible to him by
her higher spars and canvas behind them
outdistanced for the time more by luck
than speed for the scourges bottom was
fast gathering a drag of weed pugh knew
the thetis sloop-of-war was following re-
lentlessly

  somewhere below the sea rim her consort
was cruising and they were all after the
scourge the hunt for pugh was on and
these three indomitable untiring gaze-
hounds of the sea had viewed him and never
had one of them or two failed to loom on
the horizon at nightfall and again at dawn

  once after a gale that blotted sea and
sky a frigate had shown so close to them
in the swift clearance that the bullies of
the scourge could see from their deck the
yellow hull with its blue top-works and
the scarlet gun-ports that opened eagerly
to belch a broadside that came skipping
and scattering across the waves pugh
had run for it outmetaled by this frigate
of the fourth-class but not outsaued
then the sloop-of-war had appeared head-
ing them off and pugh and his bullies
fought a smashing encounter

 the sloop had diem inshore and the
frigate was plowing along far astern
so that there was nothing for pugh to do
but run the gantlet of the sloops broadside
until he could forge ahead on his superior
speed this the scourge had finally accom-
plished but not until showering round-
shot had taken toff of the crew and damaged
the gear so that pugh had to fish his fore-
topmast five bullies went overboard to
the ground sharks seven still tossed and
groaned in the stuffy cock-pit their jagged
wounds attended by the leech with the
rough surgery of those times

  their best suit of sails had been sadly
rent by the iron hail and they had been
given no time to patch only to change
foresail and two of the jibs for extra canvas
well worn and none too sound altogether
they were in evil case their bottom was
fouling rapidly so that already they could
note the difference of speed and answer to
the helm their water was low and
beginning to smell musty worst of all
the powder was running short

  they had made but a brief stay at porto
bello on account of the tip given pugh by
the tavern-keeper concerning the gold-
ship and they had been unable to buy
adventure

munitions there they had missed the
gold-ship or the tip had been false the
men were tired and lacked sleep the grog
was none too plentiful and simon hart
assiduously encouraged the idea that it
was all the fault of pugh that the captains
luck had gone that he had had his day and
that the passing of the black spot was in
order such whisperings went about with-
out any knowing who started them

  pugh sensed the trouble sensed too that
the quartermaster was the brewer and
cursed the day that he had taken among
his crew a man who knew navigation so
far the common peril kept the snake of
rebellion coiled and only sleepily resentful
once out of it pugh determined that
simon hart must die in such fashion that
the crew should not suspect pugh of the
deed and hart read the wish and the will
in pughs demeanor so that the two went
warily watching each the other

  it was the continuous presence of one
or other of the kings ships in the plata
gulf that gave pugh greatest uneasiness
true he might at nightfall slip into one
of the many mouths of the plate and work
his way through the labyrinth of creeks
but it was vital to refit and careen and to
reach the stores and powder in the maga-
zines at skull cay but it seemed evident
that the enemy knew of the existence and
location of that rendezvous

  some one had blabbed pugh knew not
whom there were moments when simon
hart wondered if the dancing witch had
played him false but he could see no reason
for such vindictiveness toward himself
and her hate of pugh he set down to a
womans whimsy a flare-up that would die
as swiftly as it had flamed nor did it
curb his ultimate ambition to displace
pugh and see himself as a master buccaneer
a swaggering colorful figure to be sung of
ashore and at sea

  meanwhile they were in jeopardy they
were closer to the land and to their haven
than the frigate but the scourge lay in a
belt of alternate calm and sudden forceless
catspaws that sent the schooner surging
forward for a little footage then died away
to leave her with slapping canvas and
jerking rigging as she pitched on the ground-
swell but the frigate was coming in on a
full breeze all her courses were set and
studdingsails had been spread in her cap-
tains eagerness to head off the chase

  on she came lifting higher and higher
until they could see the gleam of her wet
side its airy roll as it lifted and the cream-
ing rush at her bows and still the sharp
line of the wind dark against the sluggish
shore waters showed sharp and clear and
steady two miles seaward of the scourge
presently the frigate ran out of the breeze
her studdingsails hung idle course after
course wrinkled from their bellied fulness
and the crew began to take in some of the
useless kites under her own impetus she
glided into the calm belt that girdled the
schooner and lay there heaving to the
swell

  pugh looked at the distant land and at
the haze that hid the crests of the range
he looked at the sky that was a blue flame
and he looked at the sea about him a sea
of greenish brass he looked at liis crew
and at simon hart and gritted his teeth as
he walked his quarterdeck

  may their souls crisp in hell he mut-
tered and the oath included kings men
and his own

  he was trapped he had less than
thirty able men and presently boats would
drop over from the kings ship filled with
fighting men two at least to his one and
they would come swinging over the swell
with the bosuns pipe of boarders away
still ringing in then ears his men if they
could be called his would fight hard and
well but there would be no spirit in them
only the sullen desperate courage of the
cornered pirate while the kings men would
swarm over and through the nettings with
cheers

  he leveled his glass already tiny
figures were swarming at the davits of the
frigate pugh snapped the telescope shut

  lay aft here all hands he roared
men were in a tight box see to it they
dont nail the lid down on us the devils
own luck is in the weather and hear me all
ill serve a mass to satan an hell but send
us enough wind to slide by that frigate
weve got to beat off their boarding-party
so up double-nettings and fight like the
devils own gunner ill lay long tom
myself double-shot your carronades
use partridge and canister lively all of
ye or yell be squirming on hells griddles
in an hour

  pugh went forward and saw to the load-
ing of his long bow-chaser one hand fondly
on the sleek metal skin of his barking
the marooner

serpent while he hung over the breech
watching the foremost boat from the
frigate as it came up on the long surges of
the ground-swells and hung on the crests
for a moment the oars of the men dipping
in rhythmic man-of-war sweep making the
four craft that had been dispatched against
them look like water beetles straddling on
top of rather than in the water

  igi little specks of white light

  s broke out from the weapons of the
fighters soon the pirates could see
the gay colors of the uniforms the figures
of the officers in the stern sheets urging
their rowers on in the gallant race for the
honor of being first aboard the chase
they could see the spurts of foam from the
quick even catch of the ash blades work-
ing with toy-like precision the little
flotilla split apart they were going to
attack on both sides

  the pirates worked like fiends raising
a double-net above the rail piling up their
ammunition setting handy pike and double-
ax and pistol and musket many were
armed with pughs special boarding pistols
he himself carried a variety of small arms
in his belt and slung from a sash that ran
across his bare and matted chest

  every man was nude to the waist belts
were taut and kerchiefs wrapped tight
about their brows and each mans face
was grim for the encounter swabs stood
beside the inhauls of the carronades and
buckets of water ready to cool the heated
metal by the foremast they were taking
turns at a grindstone edging their cutlases
afresh and the sparks shone orange in the
sun before they died

  and still pugh waited calculating the
range and the lift of the water before he fired
he was the master-gunner of them all and
their only hope lay in smashing at least one
boat no easy mark as it raced on the
leading cutter poised on the rounded
summit of a swell and pugh squinting
through the sight dipped the glowing
linstock to the powdered touch-hole the
long-tom roared and white smoke cauli-
flowered up from the muzzle in the still air
pugh peering through the screen saw the
shot souse into the sea beside the boat
shearing off the blades of the port oars
and throwing the crew into temporary
confusion

  jump to it-ye jump he yelled

lending his strength to the inhaul of the
gun seizing the swab himself and plying it
dexterously

  the charge was set and rammed home
with almost incredible swiftness and pughs
hawk eyes fiercely sighted the mark the
missile plumped fairly into the cutter
fragments flew and the sea was dotted
with the black forms of struggling men
survivors of the deadly aim

   the second boat swung in to the rescue
and pugh laughed

   a taste of our metal they didnt relish
he crowed well try em again

   but his next shot ricocheted harmlessly
past the target and a puff of white smoke
from the bows of the frigate followed by a
hollow boom sounded the recall

  done theyre done the snivelling
hounds cried pugh

  no by god the wind is coming
he had seen the flattened royals and sky-
sails on the distant frigate puff and fall to
puff again while a line of foam showed faint
at her bows the boats had turned with
the men they had rescued from the wreck
of the cutter and were speeding back
twice more the long-tom roared without
a hit

   seaward the sky had suddenly darkened
wind pouring out of gathering clouds as
from a bellows the swift riffle of it all about
the frigate now and reaching toward the
scourge the kings men had to get
aboard which equalized to some extent the
fact that the schooner was last to get the
breeze a fine haze had veiled the sky
and tarnished the sun a moan came out
of the source of the wind a hurricane was
forward it was not a plate pampero but
a true sea-gale

   a black mass to thee satan shouted
pugh well beat em yet

  the sudden unleashed gale grew in in-
tensity aboard the frigate they were
shortening sail as she rushed on toward the
scourge but now the schooner had caught
the breeze and was fleeing northward the
wind abeam the sweet lines of her entry
slicing the long rollers that had replaced
the heave of the swell the heavier frigate
heeled her bows deep to the catheads her
masts abend a faint sound like a pistol
-shot came to the scourge and an unfurled
royal flew from the frigate like a bird yet
her superior canvas while it held smashed
her through the seas faster than the


adventure

scourge which trailed a beard of weed
along her keel and she held the windward
gage

  the frigate did not fire the distance
was still extreme for her range and the
pitch and toss of chaser and chased made
targetry a waste of powder but her
canvas held in the bolt-ropes the lighter
sails having been furled before the full
fury of the gale broke and she gained little
by little a drenching area of rain from
an overswollen cloud passed between the
two ships hurrying to gain the shore with
the remnants of its load and for a minute
or so blotted out all view

  following it came a gusty squall and the
wounded topmast of the scourge smashed
at the cross-trees still the frigate gained
and now a long headland loomed up barring
the way the schooner could not clear
it but pugh held on to his tack until the
last moment before he ordered-

   bout ship

  the pirates hauled madly on the sheets
as the scourge spun on her keel and clawed
a frantic way seaward into the face of the
gale with the kings ship plunging like a
bull coming fast up as the schooner
crossed her bows the frigate yawed and fire
spurted from her dripping sides round
shot screeched through the rigging above
the voice of the storm round shot gouged
the scourges planks and tore away her rail
round shot slugged into her side-planks as
she rose to the roll of the sea peak and
throat halyards of the mainsail were torn
away as the blocks came smashing down
the canvas drooped like the broken wing of
a bird and the schooner fell off in the trough

 two men swarmed aloft with repair
tackle but as she rose to the pitch of the
great waves another volley came and men
dropped groaning while pugh cursed at
their impotence

 satan take me but send rain he
bawled as he stood at the wheel astride
the headless helmsman who had fallen
at his feet in the last discharge

  above them an ebon cloud was rived with
lightning and from the gash a blinding
torrent fell hiding sea and sky battering
the deck and hissing in the scuppers
striving to flatten the rearing waves
that ran and leaped uncontrolled as the
hurricane reached its height

  the mainsail reefed close rose again
and the stricken schooner gained headway

pugh could not see the frigate for the storm
and darkness but he knew she too must
have tacked to avoid the cape and was now
using every effort to combat the gale out
to sea they fought foot by foot under the
inky pall of the sky while the thunder
pealed and the rain thudded down once
only as a blue javelin split the clouds from
the zenith did pugh catch a glimpse of the
laboring frigate

  hour after hour they beat out until they
had struggled through to the skirts of the
tempest and at sunset sailed a troubled
but subsiding sea without sail in sight or
fall of land

chapter vi

reprisal

at midnight pugh sat alone in his
cabin neither his lieutenant folsom
the leech nor simon hart who slept in
tiny cubbyholes that opened from the main
cabin had come aft since they had run
out of the storm all three were forward
with the men and though pugh had closed
transom and door against the sound he
was conscious of snatches of song and
drunken shouting in the bows

  for the first time he had lost control
of his men they had refused to clean
ship after they had run out of the gale
and pugh swallowing his black wrath
had let the matter go under simon harts
smiling excuse that the hands were dog-
tired

  it presaged trouble pugh realized that
very plainly he was not the man to
brook tamely the taking away of his
authority and a place forward among the
hands with his share the same as the least
among them he could hardly believe
that he had dropped the whip and lost the
power over his bullies they were all
brainless-save simon hart left to them-
selves they knew naught but to drink sing
or listen to bragging evil yarns they
never thought a story-spinner could hold
them any one with initiative could get an
audience the last thought placed in their
heads was the prime one and simon hart
the crafty devil had worked upon them
as a modeler would handle clay until they
were all of his pattern with hart out of
the way he pugh could bring them round
again
the marooner

  and he walked the cabin pondering the
best way of disposing of simon hart he
might challenge him or start a quarrel

  the medico came down the companion-
way and sank down unbidden on a chair
at the table beneath the gimbaled lamp
his face was drawn and his tired eyes were
set in black caverns

   ranting dick has gone he said
bates and willett will go out with the
dawn i may pull ames through but hell
lack a leg and bartlet is in evil case
pugh scowled of all the crew bates
and ranting dick might have been de-
pended upon to stand with him against
the rest

  stop your croaking he said angrily
then changed his note nay folsom
i meant it not ye need somewhat to
bring back your own blood art white
as a corpse mix yourself a rummer of
grog mix one for me

  the leech looked craftily at pugh as he
mixed gin water and the juice of limes
with sugar into a cold toddy there was
malice in his eyes

  theres trouble forard he essayed
tentatively and as pugh did not forbid him
went on

  the men say that pughs luck has
broken that ye have given your soul to
satan and that ye are accursed they
have held a council and they have voted
to slip ye the spot

  he squealed suddenly like a rabbit when
it feels the fetters bite and his glass fell
from his palsied hands as pugh clutched
him about the throat and shook him clear
of the floor

  so they will slip me the spot will they
and they have sent ye sneaking aft to
deliver it you dog you drug-pounding
treacherous dog ye dare to come to me
and tell me i am to be deposed

  he flung the doctor from him with a
crash and the leech landed in a huddle upon
his hands and knees

  nay i bring nothing i-i voted
against it i came to warn ye they
will slip ye the spot in the morning i tell
ye some wanted to see ye walk the plank
but i would none of it

  aye ye persuaded simon hart to mercy
i doubt not said pugh grimly get up
man and finish your grog mix more
now listen where are your drugs in
harts cabin

  yes

  have ye enough to mix a sleeping draft
for the quartermaster have ye enough to
mix one so deep for hart that he will wake
up in hell listen folsom do this for me
and we will win through yet well slip
through this cordon well repair ship and
sneak back to porto bello or some other
port and refit well get more bullies to
replace our dead and you folsom shall be
my right-hand man a double share for
ye in all well set up another rendezvous
and ye shall have a house there of your own
a house for your loot and your women
what say ye

  it must be a cunning drug or that devil
hart will note it in his liquor and one
that acts swiftly with him down i will
drive the rest of them until they beg for
me to forgive them have ye such a drug
folsom look ye he clapped the lecch
upon the back i have gold and jewels
here aboard the scourge ill share the
gold with ye and give ye the pick of the
jewels gems to win a womans favor with
folsom gold to buy it

  where is it asked folsom still with
the malice cold in his eyes though now it
was tinged with greed

  there is a false bottom to the locker
in my room cabin below floor-level slip
forard and take the drug put it in harts
drink and then come back to me art
game for it

  the leech nodded and pushed pughs
second toddy toward him

  yell pledge me your word he asked

  pugh picked up the rummer and gulped
down its contents

   ill play fair with ye he said

  suddenly his face contracted his mouth
drew back in a snarl and he set an uncertain
hand to his head looking at folsom through
a thickening haze his voice came in a
husky growl that choked in his dry throat
as his staring eyes began to glaze

  double-dealing knave ill-

  he lurched heavily against the table and
groaned as folsom watched him with
fascinated gaze then pugh squared him-
self with a mighty effort andstood erect
a dirk in his hand

  drug me would ye ill slit thy
weasand

  folsom made a sudden dive for the com-
panionway but pugh towered between him
and escape with the dose that the lecch


adventure

had mixed in the second toddy it seemed
incredible that the pirate chief could keep
his senses he dodged behind the table
and pugh came toward him with a certain
grim dexterity wedging him in a corner of
the main cabin behind the table and reach-
ing for him his head nodding as if with
the palsy dry lips apart eyes protruding
with the effort of the will back of
them

  pughs fingers closed twisting the
medicos cravat and dragged him across
the table turning him on his back wind
and speech cut off weak and limp from
semi-suffocation gaze goggling at the blade
that descended in inexorable jerks that
marked the failing coordinations of pughs
mind and body descended until its sharp
edge broke the skin and gashed flesh and
windpipe while the air from folsoms lungs
rushed whistling out with his escaping soul
his half-severed head fell back across the
tables edge and pugh groping toward
the sealed companionway bolted and barred
it before he slumped and lay inert

     pugh came back to consciousness
with a frightful pounding pain
in his head a searing almost un-
endurable torment his mouth was foul
and dry when with an effort he opened
his gummy eyes the vertical rays of the sun
glared into them and added torture to the
pulsating agony of his brain

  he was lying in the bottom of a small
boat his bulk wedged and crumpled be-
tween the thwarts the boat floated on
even keel in a dead calm there were little
sucking noises at the bow that sounded to
him like drum-strokes along the thwarts
lay a mast with its sail wrapped about it
together with two oars in the stern were
two kegs and a baling pannikin

  pugh managed to get one arm across his
face to shade the furnace of the sun
slowly recollection came back to him in
disjointed fragments as it had registered
he remembered the drugging and the
killing of folsom-that was a deed well
deserved and well done-then the breaking
of the skylight the battering down of a
door with himself rising and fighting like a
man in his sleep he remembered the
taunting face of simon hart then he had
fired at it and missed but had hit some one
for a face back of hart had changed from
a triumphant grin to a mask of pain some

one had struck him on the head from
behind-and that had been the end

  and they had not killed him why
he lifted his head and exquisite agony
spread from a spot above his right ear
until it surged like a white flame through
his consciousness the blow must have
laid bare his brain he feared to touch
the place it seemed to him he would feel
the pulsing matter oozing at the contact
as an egg when the shell is broken but the
membrane holds intact and dimly shows
the yolk that was how his head must be
and the sun was frying his brains yet
he could use them he was still alive
it was the remnant of the cursed drug that
bound him presently he would get up
make an effort plan the future

  he lapsed again when he revived he
lay in shadow the sky was a bowl of
jade above him and the boat was moving
tossing to one side and another unevenly
as if in the jobble of a tide-rip thepain
in his brain was less the vitality seemed
to have come back to him somewhat
though he was terribly cramped and
terribly weak so that the best he could
do was to crawl and twist himself to a
huddle in the stern close to the two kegs

  there was no wind no tide-rip no motion
on the placid sea of peacock-blue

  blunt muzzles reared above the surface
gray forms rubbed against the planks like
great cats that arch and scrape their backs
while waiting to be fed the boat swayed
and swerved as the sharks forged under
the keel and lifted it there were two
score of them or more silently persistently
striving to upset the thing that kept from
them the food they sensed and craved

  it was cooler it had rained yesterday
tomorrow it would likely rain again since
the rains were fairly started but mean-
time with his partial revival there came a
craving for food and water principally for
water pugh knew what was in the kegs
beside him before he made certain of it
they had given him pughs provender
the same brandy and salt-meat he had
devised for those he had marooned if
he could only strike land somewhere and
find puddles and pools of yesterdays down-
pour he seemed partly paralyzed from
the drug and he hitched himself up with
elbows and hands to a higher position

  far to the south he thought he glimpsed
the blue phantom of a sail that would
the marooner

be the scourge there must have been a
breeze when they had put him overboard
pugh prayed that one of the kings ships
might come up and demolish the schooner
and hang simon hart to the yardarm
kicking and jerking like an impaled crab

  the sun dropped and evening swiftly fled
before night pugh could no longer quite
control his mind he was still afraid to
touch the wound he had received it must
have been from belaying pin or marlinspike
he thought and he held the belief that only
a thin integument lay between his brain
and the air once let that be picrced and
he would die

  all night gray sharks trailed with the
boat muzzling nudging each other in a
ghastly cortege sooner or later what was
in the boat would come to them sooner-
or later once pugh thought he heard the
boom of guns across the watery sounding-
board but he could not be sure

  soon after that he began to see shapes
seated on thwart and gunwales some with
their dried arms folded and their desiccated
bodies in the water there were others
who grinned at him from the bows folsom
the leech with his severed throat and simon
hart good-if that was simons ghost
simon was dead and he pugh was still
alive very weak but alive and there-
fore still the better man

  the shapes were those of men and
women vaguely he remembered some of
them he had marooned them there
was one phantom of a girl with great black
eyes she had died by her own hand-
after    and there were the four men
he had left on the cay he had left three
there just recently where were they
ah there-there on the next thwart one
was bald-headed priest-face he had called
him

   the boat began to slide along in the grip
of some mysterious current for there was
no breeze no veil in the sky to herald rain
water there it was a hidden stream
running underneath the keel and he too
weak to dig for it once he had seen a man
with divining rods   

  dawn rushed up and the phantoms dis-
appeared the boat rocked the gray
shapes were breaking water now pugh
essayed to pick up an oar and batted feebly
at the snouts that showed the boat
swerved they were trying to capsize it
the boat moved on grounded and now the

blood-beat in his brain grew louder it
was surf breaking on low land pugh craned
his head painfully he was being carried
fast by flood and current to a sandy beach
dotted with gray shrubs

  land and somewhere in some rock
crevice there must be water the boat
bumped dragged lifted and bumped on
again a swell tilted the stem and swept
the boat on to strand it on the shore the
gray shapes were cheated left behind in
deeper water he was ashore

  somehow he got out and collapsed on
the wet sand then some vital spark
brightened and he began to crawl me-
chanically up the slope there were no
rocks about that his bleary eyes could see
but there were marks that showed that
turtles had been there how fresh the
trail he could not tell he could no longer
reason his moves were instinctive some
low mounds loomed ahead they should
be where the turtles had covered their eggs
he clawed with painful effort and unearthed
a grinning skull

  he tried to scramble from the place and
bones grasped at him from the loosened
sand with a prodigious effort he got to his
knees and so to tottering feet out of the
palmetto scrub three grisly figures came
toward him ragged thin-one of them
had a bald head the others   

  pugh turned and lurched down the slope
he was blind and dizzy his brain afire
he could not see his boat and staggered
on with outspread arms pursued by the
phantoms he heard the lap of water
it was the old swimming-pool he would
dive and escape there was a gap behind
an old root waist-deep he splashed into
the lagoon scooping up the salt sea and
thinking it nectar then he struck the
verge of a tide-swept gulf and plunged
forward

  a gray shape followed swiftly by another
and yet another rose swirled and lunged
there was a commotion under the surface
that sent long ripples diverging on the top
ripples stained with crimson that rapidly
dissolved to streamers of pink

 twas pugh himself cried alec
graeme the sharks have got
him

  he has left his boat said will graeme
hoarsely he has left his boat see
there are mast and sail come alec come

john weve won through margaret
he fell to his knees on the sand in thank-
fulness and his brothers dragged up the

chapter vii

the end of the chase

in the gray of the dawn captain thorne
of his majestys sloop-of-war thetis
chuckled as he picked up the pirate schooner
that he had fought at long range as they
drifted through the starlit almost breeze-
less night now the wind strengthened
with the dawn the canvas filled and they
bore down upon the scourge

  it was the end of the long chase the
schooner sailed but sluggishly compared
with the sloop and while her stern-chaser
fired intermittently the aim was bad and
the shot fell short

  they are saving on the charges pow-
ders low he said to his lieutenant
weve got them now blair

  the woman standing by the rail moved
over to him her sleepless eyes were
brilliant captain thorne nodded to her

  well have them inside of an hour mrs
graeme he said kindly thanks in
great measure to you

  pugh must know the island where he
left them youll get it from him cap-
tain

  aye well persuade him to tell all he
knows as she moved back to the rail
where she had watched ever since the
first shot had been fired thome added in
an undertone to his junior if we get him
alive well keep bargain with her and
seek the island but they can hardly be alive
for all her faith look-look at their flag
they are surrendering

  the black flag of the pirate was fluttering
down its halyards then it stopped and
through his glass captain thome noted a
commotion on her decks a figure broke

from a mob of men and fled down a hatch-
way but the flag came on down to the deck

  cease firing ordered thorne

  suddenly the schooner seemed to split
apart as a gush of black smoke rushed up
from her amidships a dull roar came over
the water and the smoke spread above a
flash of red while fragments of spars fell
slowly there was a momentary vision
of the stern and bow of the schooner
plunging beneath the waves and then as
the smoke drifted off before the wind a few
blackened scraps of floating timber a
struggling speck or two that vanished and
the career of the scourge was ended
simon hart cheating the gallows had
broken through his spirit-crushed men and
fired the remnants of the magazine

  margaret graeme pale-faced gazed
horror-struck at the spot where the scourge
had vanished now the last hope of find-
ing will was surely gone slowly with
hanging head she went below to the cabin
thorne had assigned her where the negress
sat with the babe

   she was still there sick despairing when
a cry came from the mast-head

  hardly discernible a black dot showed
against the salmon of the sunset sky the
thetis shifted course and soon the dot
became a boat making steady headway
to the northwest under a lug sail closer
and closer the sloop came toward the tiny
craft until all aboard could see three men
in the stern and then a waving cloth

  mrs graeme a miracle has happened
said captain thome your husband and
his brothers are alongside

   margaret rose with shining eyes

  an answer to prayer is not a miracle
captain thorne she said and with her
babe in her arms she went on deck

  there must have been a hurricane
somewhere said alec graeme the kind
that comes before the rains arrive prob-
ably it destroyed the growth on some isle
and its to be hoped there were none living
on it but the drift brought the uprooted
palms to us and scattered five of them
along the beach two more we got by
wading off the point seven in all close
to two hundred nuts with nigh to half a
pint of life-saving liquor in each of them
that saved us sheer luck i call it

  plus sheer pluck said captain thorne

  but margaret graeme safe in her hus-
bands wasted arms knew otherwise
do you remember that several years ago
we suggest ed naming regiments instead
of numbering them or in addition to num-
bering them the idea is sound since
weve enlarged our army regiments and
divisions have frequently been given names
it makes for esprit de corps also it is a
natural human impulse

  one of you who took up the idea was c s
edmiston of quitman mississippi who sug-
gested a regiment of musicians but he did
more than that he went ahead and by his
own efforts organized a military band that
band was accepted for service and when i
heard from mr edmiston was stationed
with the th engineer regiment he
himself was expecting a discharge because
of physical disability his third honorable
discharge but his band remains in service

an interesting word from h a
lamb concerning his story in this
issue mr lamb like several others of
our writers brigade is still able to furnish
us occasional stories though in the army

  alamut is not a creation of the author it was
one of the four castles of the refik the latter are
more commonly known as the ismail ians a sect
that separated themselves from the other moham-
medans

  a secret empire wielding murderous power
more powerful than the knights templars the
council of twelve or the ku klux klan the
old man of the mountain a master of the
empire so feared by his subjects that two of them
threw themselves from the high walls of a castle
at the bidding of a priest in order to impress a
foreign envoy a paradise so devilishly ingenious
that the warriors of the refik threw away their
lives readily in order to return as they supposed
to the joys of the ismailian paradise

tphese were startling particulars even for the
adventurous times of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries they proved however to
be history and not legend the dynasty of the
assassins as the rulers of alamut were called
holds its place among the kings of persia the

old man of the mountains who should more
correctly be called the sheikh of the mountains
was known to travelers and historians from marco
polo to mirkhond as to the paradise it is not
known whether its power for evil lay in the effects
of the drug hashish or in an actual scene of splendoi
and license

  the power of the assassins was broken by hulagu
khan and his tatars some two hundred and fifty
years before the time of khlit but nests of the
ismailians survived until the end of the eighteenth
century and as a religious sect the ismailians
number many followers today-deprived of course
of the secret terror of their ancient daggers

any one who can tell just what our
camp-fire is is wiser than i on the
face of things it is merely an indefinite
something on paper only certainly there
is no definite organization of any kind-no
officers no constitution or by-laws no fees
or dues a few unwritten rules but no
formalities of any kind any one belongs
who wishes to and he doesnt need any help
in joining

  our camp-fires general object is an in-
definite kind of good-fellowship and it pre-
tends to nothing except being the means
of swapping interesting experiences of
course our lost trails ask adventure
and other free services are practical helps
but in each of them the magazine is a neces-
sary factor our magazine avowedly tries
to help its readers when it can but the
thing that always leaves me in doubt is the
relationship among the camp-fire mem-
bers themselves theoretically they are
under no obligations to each other theo-
retically they only read or write the letters
we have in our department of the magazine
theoretically they are acquainted only on
paper

  but the facts of the case the facts
knock the theories sky-high again and
again and again i learn here at this clear-
ing-house desk of real friendships created
by our camp-fire i am the richer by quite
adventure

 

 a number of them myself and here is a
 letted from one of you which speaks for itself

    to show the camp-fire what its members are like
  i wish you would print this letter without names or
  identity of course just say a camp-fire-ist had
  his shack burgled and gutted and got this letter
  from another camp-firer i only wish it was good
  form to tell who he was of coursc i didnt need
  the help but oh man what a man he is to so
  offer any lodge would ask me are your dues
  paid up but he-i havent the words to tell what
  he is that is the old-time west exemplified in him

    the last sentence in his letter refers to three
  notches in the butt of my  that he noticed but
  was too tactful to ask about

   following is the letter he enclosed and
 asked to have returned to him the two
 men never heard of each other until they
 got acquainted through our camp-fire

    i am coming at you head on square as a brick
  with no evasion or dodging the issue you would
  take me in and feed me and sleep me and divide your
  tobacco with me if i came along broke and down on
  my luck now you give your friends the same
  privilege

  oend me a list of what you need most with sizes
  descriptions etc and send it at once ill be
  teetotally jumped up if i am going to have you left

	in such a plight i have been studying how to help
  in some way that would not hurt your feelings and
  i have given up the struggle believing that tbe best
  way is to come at you like one man meeting an-
  other you and i are no women to hem and haw
  over things if we were trapping in partnership or
  prospecting the same way what one had both would

  have it dont niake a-bit of difference if i am

  here in an upper room and you out there we have
  got to look at this thing as though we slept under the
  same blanket and ate out of the same frying-pan

    what do you need most if it is underclothing
  what sizes if it is socks too what size if it is

half a dozen times if i had a car i would have gone
right down there as soon as i heard and if i did go
there i would sure labor with that cuss by force of
arms dont you kill anybody unless you can prove
self defense

jut ere is a letter with some big ideas
 the general purpose is the real ameri-
canization of naturalized citizens and the
prevention of strong alien allegiance among
those in this country who are not citizens a
general purpose- which i indorse un-
qualifiedly

  as to barring the teaching of any foreign
language in our schools there must be limi-
tations if no americans could speak french
spanish and other foreign languages it
would mean not only an immense com-
mercial social literary and scientific loss
but an increase in the provincialism that is
one of our national weaknesses even
from a military point of view a nation none
of whose people can speak the enemy lan-
guage is at a decided practical disadvantage
to say nothing of ability to speak the lan-
guage of foreign allies my own first im-
pulse was a desire to sweep all foreign
languages from our schools but second
thought convinces most of us that the rem-
edy itself would be a calamity

and a needless calamity only the ger-
man language is now a danger in its
case i am for drastic measures the other
languages are a different matter one that
can safely be handled by wise limitations
and a more gradual treatment as a first
step we might for example bar all lan-
guages as compulsory parts of any school
course forbid the use in schools of any for-
eign language as the teaching language in any
the camp-fire



subject except that language itself and per-
haps ban the teaching of any foreign language
in primary grades these merely as sugges-
tions the subject is far too complicated for
settlement in a few brief sentences

but the german language is a case by
itself a case in which the one pressing
necessity overrides academic arguments
and even consistency in according german
the same treatment as other languages
the issue of the war is at the date this is
written still in doubt but only a blind fool
can deny that up to  military success
has been with the enemy their success
has been due to only four things- mili-
tary and economic organization and pre-
paredness  unity of command in the
hands of trained soldiers  sacrifice of
right to might of humanity and decency to
brute efficiency and at least as important
as any of the other reasons  systematic
propaganda at home and abroad

  we have been inclined to view this fourth
reason german propaganda as bad but not
as vital yet if you analyze the german
success down to its very fundamentals and
beginnings you find that systematic propa-
ganda has been their most important weapon
it began several generations ago in ger-
many itself the systematic governmental
education of the german people into effi-
cient carefully shaped cogs in the great
hun machine of brute force the second
step was the planting of germans in other
countries notably russia the united
states and latin america generally as citi-
zens of these countries but always held to
germany and germanys interests by the
invisible steel chains of german propa-
ganda the third step was the building up
among these hospitable peoples of senti-
ments advantageous to germanys inter-
ests and particularly the fomenting and
encouraging of any and all kinds of internal
differences and strife among these peoples
that would weaken them against the day
when germany would be ready to strike

there was no chance in all this no
luck no accident nothing but a
coldly carefully worked-out definite plan of
tremendous size and the whole sum and
substance of that plan the very heart of it
was hun propaganda and education sub-
tle delicate psychological invisible and
almost unsuspected when sometimes we

noticed a silken thread of the great hun web
we failed to realize that it was not silk but
steel almost no one realized that the little
thread was part of a vast world-choking
web of evil hun ambition

  even now americans fail to give this web
a hundredth part of its real importance
we are still enmeshed in it our every effort
more or less crippled by its barely visible
throttling grip it is not just a crude mat-
ter of spies and property destroyers in our
midst that is merely ordinary enemy
activity-mere childs play compared to the
less visible instruments and not half so
serious spies and bombs produce quick
results these more subtle instruments may
not produce results for years or generations
but their results arc infinitely more danger-
ous to us and-more permanent

  it would take years and volumes to
specify all the tiny and various means em-
ployed but as a whole they can be quickly
gaged by considering the central hun ma-
chine at berlin that for years and years has
been systematically spinning this silk-
steel web do you know that at berlin
there is a regular and permanent govern-
ment department officially called the
bureau of enemy psychology stop read-
ing a minute and think what that means

we pride ourselves on being a prac-
tical people we believe in driving
at main results by direct paths we are
commercial and industrial labor material
capital transportation these we consider
the practical factors we belong to the
want results show me aint no such
animal class it is things not ideas that
we handle and believe in the most patri-
otic thing i can say is that we are -

fools no thing ever existed that was not
first an idea or that can not be shaped and
controlled by ideas the average ameri-
can business man believes nothing is prac-
tical unless he can feel it with his fingers
or enter it on the pages of a ledger and
thereby proves himself an infant in swad-
dling-clothes or an adult imbecile and all
the rest of us are a good deal like him
wherefore the hun who for all his brutish-
ness is intelligent enough to understand
that ideas are more important and more
practical than things has been able to en-
tangle us in a net whose strength is almost
wholly psychological

  the hun wove this kind of net because he
	adventure

knew that to control the ideas of men is to
control every concrete thing that men
possess we let him get away with it
because we were too drunk with our childish
delusion that only things were practical

 he hun is so alive to the value of his
psychological net that he guards from
publicity its very existence he has pre-
vailed thus far solely because of it and he
knows that if we begin to realize the im-
portance of that net his immediate and his
ultimate hopes are dead i have heard
that any one who sees the psychological net
and tries to warn his fellows will be marked
down by the hun machine and quieted or-
removed probably you and i differ be-
cause you do not believe that and i consider
it very possible god knows that if i knew
more of the inside definite details id gladly
shout them from the house-tops i do not
know them but i can see the web the de-
tails are important only as a means for
making you see it if i can make any see it
who have not seen it hitherto i do not mind
seeming silly and childish to the rest of you
by suggesting that if any calamity hap-
pens to drop on me after this is published
said accident might be taken as tending
to prove the very point i wish to make

toubtless most of you will consider
i- merely silly and fantastic the report
that german thoroughness and understand-
ing of psychological values has led them to
install at berlin a little corps of men
steeped in the psychological wisdom of
india adepts in human mysteries laughed
at by the practical western world and
that hypnotism on an international scale is
one of the weapons systematically used by
the hun machine personally i do not
consider it silly and fantastic it may not be
true and yet it may certainly it is in
keeping with german methods and i am
not fool enough to laugh it off the boards
merely because i cant pinch it with my fin-
gers in any case it is a perfect example of
the kind of net they have been spinning for
generations

r  his to come back to our letter is why
i am strong for drastic action against
the german language in our schools for
that and publications in german are an
essential part of the hun web the letters
suggestion that german be barred from all

our primary schools seems to hit at the
heart of the matter but the remedy should
go further for example no german
course should be open at any time to any
child of german parentage or birth

  as to the german press there is only one
safe argument against suppressing it at
least during the war-the plea that loyal
publications in german can be of value in
creating american loyalty among germans
i do not belive this argument is sufficient

tn general mr sextons letter is
based on the principle that no one is fit
to be a citizen of the united states unless he
is fully able to speak the language of the
united states fully able to transact all the
business of a citizen of the united states in
the language of the united states a
sound principle and a truth so elementary
that we seem very stupid in being so long in
seeing that truth any organization in
support of this would be good but it is to be
remembered that there is already a strong
organization working along similar lines-
the american defense society  east
d street new york city n y

  this is mr sextons letter he can be ad-
dressed in our care

  dear sir-i propose the formation of the
american language league objects a enact-
ment of legislation with concurrent development of
public sentiment to prohibit the teaching of any
alien language in any primary school whether pub-
lic or private b the suppression so far as pos-
sible of daily newspapers published in an alien
tongue whether or not they print parallel columns
in english c the americanization of immi-
grants as quickly and completely as possible by pro-
viding facilities for learning the english language
and encouragement to make use of said facilities
d legislation limiting the rights of aliens to vote
to such of them as can read and write and speak
english fluently e the development of a senti-
ment hostile to organizations designed to keep alive
the interest of foreigners in alien governments cus-
toms and institutions

  but the one weapon of sharp steel wherewith to
fight alien intrigue is-language it is because this
is so true that the german government through its
agents in america fights so hard to retain the ger-
man language in the daily life of our people re-
move it and the kaiser goes with its removal you
can not have a real american country unless the
members thereof think exclusively in the american
language and approach other languages as they ap-
proach greek or latin or as they learn some modem
and unfamiliar language in the years of youth or
manhood as an elective study

   if some of the adventurers started such an or-
ganization i believe it would quickly acquire many
thousands in members dues nominal-a r

firearms old and new

by d w iggins and l f brown

a complete history of the principal types of firearms
their development and an aithoritative discussion of
those now in general use

there are few subjects in which the
readers of this magazine are more
interested than in firearms for
some years we have considered a department
devoted to them as ask adventure is
best divided into departments according to
geographical areas covered a department
on firearms does not belong there but
adventure is not through growing yet and
some day we may be able to accept one of
the kind offers that have been made by so
many of you who are willing to act as
adventures gun expert

  all magazines now and then allow mis-
takes in firearms details to creep into their
stories and our own magazine has not been
guiltless it is not easy to prevent a
perfect editor of adventure would know not
only all about all kinds of firearms but all
about some thousands of other subjects
equally complex and intricate i dont
neither does any one else on the staff
further the staff changes from time to
time and a comparatively green man re-
places one who had begun to learn the
things we have to try to learn in this
particular office yet again no one man
no two men can copy-read and proof-read
every story that goes into the magazine
even if one or two of us knew all about
firearms it wouldnt insure against mis-
takes most of our writers are pretty well
up on firearms personally but even this
additional check is not enough to prevent
a mistake now and then

you readers can help as you have in
the past by pointing out mistakes if
we make them help comes after the mis-
take is made but it tends to prevent simi-
lar mistakes in the future recently there
came a letter from lloyd f brown of the
a llerton iowa news covering an accumu-
lation of our past sins at least part of the
points he made i already knew but they
were made just the same his letter did two
things first it made us resolve to get as

full and detailed information on firearms
as possible for reference here in the office
second it made me see that this informa-
tion would be both interestingand valuable
to most of you theres quite a lot of it
even in condensed form but it follows here
just as it came in to us and i know most of
youll have a good time with it here is
the letter from mr brown

i noticed in the camp-fire talks that you say
you welcome any suggestions that tend to make
adventure better which of course is right well
here are a couple small matters to be sure that
dont really have any effect on the stories but which
would make them sound more realistic

in the first place i see in stories now and then
references made to  and  caliber automatics
there is no such thing as a  or  automatic pistol
the only automatic calibers now made being  
     knowing this the discrep-
ancies mentioned above are very jarring to me

also there is reference made in a story in your
last issue of a man shooting an automatic and the
gun simply screaming as it poured its bullets forth
an automatic does not fire more than one shot to a
trigger-pull and no one can work one fast enough
to make the mechanism scream or anywhere near
it and i might state that revolvers can and have
been fired faster than any automatic ever was
it the story makes mention of the delicate trig-
ger evidently meaning light trigger-pull no auto-
matic has a light trigger-pull all having stiffer pulls
than a revolver as to make them light would be
to cause the probable death of the operator from
premature explosion caused from the jarring off of
the arm from the reaction of the slide

also i hate to read about automatic revolvers
there aint no such animal an automatic is
either a pistol or a machine gun and no revolver is
automatic also if any one thinks he can shoot
an automatic under water hed better take my
advice and not try it ht might not get hurt but
the chances are he would

also in the last issue there is a story in which a
man has an automatic under water in a lake dives
for it and coming to the surface shoots his man
and later states that they the automatics work
all right when wet well they may work all
right when wet and would fire the first shot all
right but unless the water had time to nm out
of the slide-spring recess and the magazine and
the barrel they wouldnt function for the second
shot

i know all of the above having tried them all
with the exception of shooting the gun under
water i wrote two pistol factories about it and
i

i
firearms old and new	

they told me most emphatically not to try it as
t would unquestionably be disastrous have owned
several of eveiy model and make and caliber of
revolver and pistol obtainable in this country and
a few not obtainable here-lloyd f brown

  i wrote to mr brown and in reply came
the following interesting letter

  i am glad to see that you took the suggestions
i made in the spirit in which they were intended
i can appreciate your position as to proof-readers
etc as i am a newspaper man

  your idea as to arranging a list of firearms of
the different makes and calibers of arms is a good
one but this subject is a pretty extensive one i
have noticed that most discrepancies in this line
arc made as to revolvers and automatic pistols and
their respective calibers and possibilities it is
truly wonderful the things writers can do with
small arms

  most of them seem to have the idea that auto-
matic pistols fire their whole magazines by simply
holding back the trigger this as i pointed out in
my previous letter is not the case it can be done
by filing off or removing the safety-sear which regu-
lates this but it would probably be disastrous to
the party holding the arm automatics have a
sharp recoil public opinion to the contrary not-
withstanding and as each shot throws the muzzle
up a little more the last few shots would no doubt
shoot the shooter in the head an automatic can
not be held rigidly solid even the smaller calibers
because of the lightning-like shifting of balance and
recoil one must brace the hand for the back-
ward plunge of the action-slide and then brace in
the other direction for the forward plunge of the
same which can not be done as the action is too
rapid also it has somewhat the effect of an
electric shock i once fired three shots from a
-caliber colt automatic which had been treated
to act like a machine gun i put only three car-
tridges in the arm as i knew how the gun would
act and i wanted it to stop shooting by the time
it was pointed straight up at least and the result
was that i felt as if i had grasped a live wire

  i am enclosing a list of the makes models and
calibers of small arms obtainable in this country
which may be of some use to you if so you are
welcome toil i can make a list of the makes and
calibers of rifles if you wish though this is such an
extensive subject that i dont know all of it i am
however acquainted with practically all the makes
used in tlite country

  the smith  wesson arms company are now
making a revolver to handle the  colt auto-
matic pistol cartridge but as they are for the use
of the army only and will not be for sale to the
trade for at least a year to come i will not list this
caliber in the revolvers-lloyd f brown

  here is the list mr brown inclosed
many of you know most or all of it already
but to any one the list as an assembled
whole has decided value

  first i wish to state that there is no such thing
as an automatic revolver a small arm must be
either a revolver automatic pistol or single shot or
double-barreled pistol an arm seldom seen

 these are all that occur to me now and i believe
 they will cover your needs i forgot to mention
 that the harrington  richardson people make a
  and a  caliber automatic pistol you under-
 stand that the small-caliber arms are all small arms
 and the large calibers are all large arms

 now i had also written on receiving mr
 browns first letter to our old friend d
 wiggins of salem oregon asking whether
 i couldnt arrange with him to cover the
 whole subject in considerable detail he
 rose to the occasion splendidly in the fol-
 lowing letter

salem ore

     i received your letter of the rd in due time
 and have read the letter of mr brown with very
 great interest

 his list of american automatics is very complete
 but there is a correction to be made the h  r
  automatic has been suspended other than

 this i do not know of a single difference in the list
 he sent

  the automatic is in my opinion at least just a
man-wounder at short range from what i can
leam of the various makes they are not the equal
of the heavy lead bullets of the big revolvers say
die colt and smith  wesson s and s

  as to the automatic only firing one shot at each
trigger-pull b is exactly right and i have never
seen any automatic fired as fast as a good revolver
can be shot either

  of course when they are not in good order as he
suggests they are dangerous to handle witness
history sayeth that the first self-loader ever brought
into oklahoma territory was a  colt automatic
pistol it was brought as a sample by a drummer
for a chicago hardware firm he was exhibiting it
in a hotel lobby at muskogee i t and bud
ledbetter the u s marshal for the creek nation
was watching him demonstrate it as bud is
reputed to have caused something like thirty-eight
bad citizens to leave this vale of tears with their
boots on he was doubtless trying to wise up on
new methods of law enforcement

  well the spatter-gun commenced to give a fine

  i can shoot as well with an automatic as i ever
saw any one shoot and i must say that if my man
were over ten yards from me i would never try to
get him in a hurry with one of those guns ed l

  as to the flying-up propensities of the automatic
i am not able to state as my chief trouble with
them was always to get the muzzle high enough to
hit within a foot of where i wanted the bullet to

up once in a blue moon however i think you
will be able to get the general drift you once
spoke of having given the once-over to a manuscript
written on a rattlesnake skin

   this is of course not complete that will take
 considerable time this is just to give you a ready
 reference for the office to use for instance john
 jones alludes to a winchester automatic pistol
 when there aint no such animal or to captain
 kidd defending his life with a six-shooter

   however most of the contributes get their gun
material so correct that it does not appear to need
much of the blue pencil

firearms past and present

   the origin of firearms and explosives is wrapped
 in mystery it is supposed that the carthaginians
 used blasting compounds but nothing is certainly
 known it is recorded that the inhabitants of a
 town in india repulsed the troops of alexander with
 flames and thunders greek fire was a well-known
 war engine of the middle ages supposed to have
 been naphtha

  gunpowder appears to have come from the far
eastern countries korea or china there is no
record of the first use of guns but it is conceded
that the celestials were in possession of the secret
of the smoking weapons as early as the seventh
century a d

   the invention of gunpowder in europe is ascribed
 to a friar one roger bacon who was so progressive
 that i am surprised that he was not attended to by
 the inquisition as a wizard berthold schwartz
 also was raising cain and smoke about the same
 time so we do not know to whom william s hart
 is most deeply indebted

   it is said that the english used cannon at crficy
 but the credit for the victory is due to the long bow
 in the hands of the english yeomen firearms did
 not play much of a part in war till the beginning
  of the sixteenth century as till that time the bow
 had a greater range the shoulder arms seem to
 have appeared about  they were a novelty

   the gun was in its element in the conquest of the
 americas the natives regarded the wielders as
 gods said belief was soon shattered by a short
 observation of the actions of the newcomers

  it is recorded that cortez had three breech-
loaders in his campaign in mexico they were a
crude tye of wedge breech and could be loaded
very fast but were not very strong on velocity and
penetration

   all firearms up to this time had been the match-
 lock so called from the fact that the charge was
 ignited by the flash of the powder in a shallow
 flash-pan on the breech of the barrel the flame
 was communicated through a small hole in the

barrel the powder in the pan being ignited by the
slow match carried by the soldier

   the arm was loaded as follows first the powder
was poured in the muzzle and a wad placed over
and rammed down on the powder then a ball
was inserted sometimes wrapped in a greased patch
but more often not this was rammed down
and then the cover of the flash-pan was raised
and a little priming powder poured in the pan
the cover then being let down upon it

  the great objections to the matchlock were that
it was visible at night it was liable to be extin-
guished by wet weather and it was apt to be fired
by a high wind blowing the powder on to the
spark

  the wheellock came about  from nurem-
berg it was manipulated in the same manner as
the matchlock with the difference that the firing
was by sparks caused by the action of a toothed
wheel on a bit of flint held by the lock over the pan

it was a great improvement over the matchlock

   a curious tale is told of the thirty years war a
detachment of the swedish troops of gustavus
adolphus was besieging a town held by the aus-
trians the latter surrendered one morning say-
ing that the great reinforcement received by the
swedes made resistance hopeless they had seen
the glowing matches they said the swede com-
mander was loo foxy to let on that the supposed
army was a swarm of fireflies who said square-
head

   the flintlock supplanted the preceding ones about
 it is the invention of a bunch of dutch -
brigands who were in the habit of eloping with
their neighbors fowls not necessarily the neigh-
bors chickens this gentle practise gave them
the name of snaphanns and the term became
snaphaunce the wheellock was a rich mans
tool the honest robber was forced to extemporize
something that a watchful hen-owner couldnt see
after dark he did it

  the flintlock was made by all the gunmakers of
the day but the english probably made the best
ones i have read that a great london maker by
the name of joseph manton finally reached such a
pinnacle of perfection that his locks were capable of
eighty per cent of fires most of the flintlocks
giving forty to sixty per cent the flintlock also
was difficult to use as there was an appreciable
pause before the shot due to the slowness of the
ignition of the powder in the barrel from the powder
in the pan

  the american rifle was the finest development
of the flintlock and to the skill of the frontiersman
with his deckard is due our national pride in shoot-
ing today also our independence

  in  a scots clergyman invented the percus-
sion system of ignition and revolutionized firearms
at first the explosive mixture was in the form of a
small pill this gave the guns using them the name
of pill-locks soon the familiar-to our daddies
-form of percussion cap came and the rainstorm
had no more terrors for hunter or soldier

  tis said that napoleon offered forsyth the sum
of  for his invention but the patriotic domi-
nie refused he offered his invention to the british
government who treated him with scorn and only
was won to the right view in time to pay a few
thousand dollars after his death truly the way
of the inventor is hard and if hes a patriot it is
still rougher


adventure

  in  colt placed on the market bis world-
famous revolver and in the hands of the citizenry
of the texas republic it won fame if we had old
sam with us today to produce equally record-
breaking weapons we would lead k ii up broad-
way in chains he was the man more than any
other who made possible the rapid expansion of
the united states in the years - as we
read that he was a man of a most violent temper
i think that he was trying to fix up something
faster than a single-shot pistol or a bowie knife
for his intercourse with his opponents probably
couldnt kill em off fast enough with the existing
armament john m browning is his modem type
as to ingenuity

  whitney in about  devised the method of
making arms by machinery to such an extent that
all parts of the same kind were interchangeable
this was a big step in the right direction as pre-
viously all broken guns were a matter for expensive
hand work by the individual gunsmith

  guns having a heavy barrel were used with both
ball and shot in countries where a different type of
game might be met india for instance

  three-barreled guns were also well liked and
four barrels were not unknown to sportsmen

  the first repeater as we now know it was the
volcanic appearing about  it was a crude
weapon and was not a great success the henry
 and the spencer  were much better
arms in every sense of the word

  winchesters first appeared in  and have been
with us since smith  wesson revolvers came
about 

  since that time the advance has been too rapid
to catalogue the sharps remington winchester
ballard hotchkiss and others have made more his-
tory than any of our readers are likely ever to see
about all of the real wild life of the globe seems to
have been tamed except for spots like mexico
tibet and the present disturbance accross the
herring-pond that can not rightly be termed a
bit of aboriginal deviltry its highly civilized liquid
fire gas non-combatants tortured and slain etc
how geronimo must revolve in his grave with envy

  roughly speaking flintlocks up to  per-
cussion to  revolvers to date from 
breech-loaders from  repeaters the same au-
tomatics from  to date the old borchart and
french arms not being known to any great extent
i think the borchart was invented in  it
was a funny-looking thing looking like a letter t
with a short upright

  so if any one tries to run anything in before these
dates you may consider him either a gun-crank of
the thirty-second degree or a faker in the latter
case i think you had better draw the editors faith-
ful weapon the printers towel and assassinate him
on the spot see e wilson nye for details

  as to some tricks that will naturally drop into
stories the double roll was done by hanging the
old single-action colts revolver on the forefinger
and whirling it over rapidly if the roller was
expert and the mainspring was not too strong the
revolver would cock and fire itself by its own
weight the thumb catching the hammer in its
revolution and the trigger being pulled by the
guns weight coming on it as the roll brought it over

  fanning was a great favorite with some of the
more spectacular of the old gun-fighters but i
never knew positively of but one man killed by the

trick the colt was held in the right hand low
down by the right side the trigger held back and
the hammer slapped swiftly by the left hand the
result was a stunning volley of shots that rarely
hit anybody

  the road-agent spin was done by presenting the
weapon to a captor upon the palm of the open hand
and as he reached to pick it up it was whirled
over and discharged many a good officer was
killed in this manner which is attributed to billy
the kid

  many gun-fighters removed the trigger from the
old colt single-action completely some tied it back
snapping the gun with the hammer only it was
quick and picturesque

  a modem double-action can be fired quicker than
any automatic i have ever seen and i am not
exactly without experience in that line i think a
man in denver mccutcheon has fired his smith 
wesson in one second for five shots hows that
for a  special all on a man-size target

  the automatic will not fire more than one shot
at each pull of the trigger unless there is some
defect in the gun this does not apply to machine
guns of course

  as to fancy shooting no one can with certainty
tell just what can be done i have done a little in
my time and have seen some really fine work with
both rifle and revolver such men as toeperwine
and gus peret can do things with a rifle or revolver
that you would brand as impossible till you had
seen them shoot gus for instance will hold his
revolver upside down and beat the best that  can
do shooting in regular fashion while i in turn can
trim die average shot in the same manner

  i have heard of one desperado who terrorized the
northwestern border some years back he was
reputed to have killed about half a dozen of the
northwest mounted he was said to be able to
lay a rifle across his arm and while working the
lever and shooting with deadly certainty to be able
to feed cartridges into the magazine through the
loading gate in the side of the frame while keeping
up a steady fire this with a winchester of course

   there is an old rifle with a history in a drug-store
in baker oregon it is an old  winchester and
was found on a bluff overlooking upper powder
river rusted into an unrecognizable mass it was
finally cleaned up so that we could identify it it
lay under a skeleton that had a bullet-hole squarely
between the eyes and the remains of about fifty
cartridge-heads lay around probably a lone miner
or cowboy who had been driven there by the in-
dians and made a game stand or it may have
been a cattle rustler there have been some queer
things done on the edge of the land i tried to get
the gun but the owner will not part with it

  now as to machine guns as i said before i
dont know as much now as i will in a short time
but uien i wont be allowed to talk i presume

  here in america there are the colt savage lewis
and the bnet-mercier the latter is the service
gun and won the dislike of all soldiers by the way
it jams at a crucial time it is claimed and prob-
ably with truth that if one of the two guns in
barracks at columbus had notjammed they would
not have had the orders to get him dead or alive
he would have been dead already

  the english use a variety of guns i recall the
maxim the hotchkiss the lewis the b s a and
many others most of the machine guns now in
firearms old and new	

use in the respective armies use the small-arm am-
munition but i understand that special guns for
the warplanes are using cartridges up to an inch in
diameter

  by the way heres a little history that you may
know already when hudson maxim invented his
famous gun he offered it to the war department
first and found a cold shoulder turned toward him
england welcomed him with open arms and knight-
hood lewis a retired colonel of the u s army
was treated the same way and his gun won fame
as the belgian rattlesnake incidentally the
famous inventor wiggins drew the same deal on a
sight he patented and offered to his uncle like a
dutiful nephew

modern firearms

  as to present-day firearms we have a host of
different makes calibers and models i list such
as i am familiar with

winchesters
model -calibers   and  w c f

  discontinued

model -calibers - - and -

  discontinued

model  or hotchkiss-caliber - dis-
  continued

model -calibers - - - -

model -caliber  only

model -calibers -   and  w

model -calibers - -  special
  - and -

model -calibers -  british  
  and    and  winchester -
  - two latter are now discontinued

the automatics run from the  caliber up 
  and the  the most powerful automatic
made

shotguns are made in    and  gage

no winchester revolvers or pistols were ever made
  some writers to the contrary notwithstaning

          remingtons
autoloading also called automatic-calibers 
  and  only slide actions the same with
the old-style  and  in addition

remingtons made rifles of all descriptions since
   and i am not familiar with all the models
  the remington-keene and the later models of
  the remington-lee were powerful weapons the
  latter being a high-power rifle and made in cali-
  bers from  or  mm up to -

savages

savages are made in  h p - -
  -  - and - light  re-
  peaters are also made savage automatic pis-
  tols arc made in calibers  and  a few
  experimental s were made for the u s army
  and the only ones that were ever offered the pub-
  lic were the ones rejected from the tests when
  automatics were selected by the board of ord-
  nance

marlins

marlins are made in calibers   and  rimfire
in more powerful models they are made in -

  - - - - -  special
  - - - - --- -
  and -

shotguns are made in  and  gages

colts

colts revolvers arc made in     
     and  calibers the last
  three are for english shells

colt automatics are made in     
  and  calibers

colts formerly made rifles and shotguns but have
  ceased to do so several years since many
  models of their revolvers have been discontinued
  and i am not familiar with them their most
  popular model for hard service is still the old
  model that colonel colt placed on the market
  in  with the various improvements neces-
  sary to adapt it to cartridges it being a muzzle-
  loader when first brought out catalogued as
  the single-action army and frontier

  many makes of firearms have been discontinued
and off the market for years but the ones i have
mentioned are the ones in most general use to-day
in america and to a great extent in the whole world
the winchester can be found in every country under
the sky

mausers

  in europe before the beans were spilled the
mauser and the heavy double-barreled rifle were
the heavy game and maii killing weapons the
mauser is the parent with but two exceptions as
nearly as i can tell of every rifle that is drilling
holes in wilhelms cohorts today the two excep-
tions are the winchester and the martini

  mausers have been in use since  and were
modeled on the old needle gun as made by dreyse
supposedly they were made in calibers 
         and
 i think one was made in  caliber but am
not sure mauser made a great many actions and
barrels for other manufacturers who finished the
fine points themselves and then labeled the gun as
their own product this was particularly true of
the english gunmakers they furnished mausers
for a bewildering array of ammunition and for
every conceivable game under the sun incidentally
they demanded many shekels for their handiwork
so much in fact that i never felt justified in pur-
chasing any of their wares

  yes there is an automatic revolver made mr
brown to the contrary notwithstanding it is the
webley-fosbery made by the webley company
the contractors to the british government it is
made in  and - calibers walter winans
the expert shot praises it highly

  for the man who is going out there a good
thing to remember when stocking up on firearms
is that the sizes of ammunition most easily found in
out-of-the-way places are the following ones

   caliber rifle and pistol cartridges

  -gage shotgun shells

   winchester or - rifle cartridges

  these can almost always be picked up in any
store and even in most camps a man runs across one
in this country the - rifle ammunition is almost
as easily obtained but i do not think it would be
so in foreign countries

for the man who needs weapons that can be
adventure



always used in any country from the ammunition
view-point i would recommend the following bat-
tery

  one rifle or carbine caliber  or - as the
individual preference map dictate

  one colt or smith  wesson revolver as the
individual may prefer using the rifle shell in 

  one shotgun  gage double or repeater

  this armament can always be depended upon to
get food in any country and the ammunition is not
expensive it can usually be replenished at out-of-
the-way places

  if a man must go stripped down to his clothes
and one weapon i would choose a double-barreled
shotgun this with shot shells for small game
and a few ball loads for large mammals is without
doubt the one all-around gun in a mixed-game
country carry one barrel loaded with shot and the
other with the round ball the latter is deadly at a
range of fifty yards and gives terrible shocking effect

  the automatics are at present the best thing in
the one-hand gun for close work that we have i
refer to the colt  automatic pistol adopted by
the government of course while it does not
appear to give the shocking effect of the big calibers
using black powder and soft-lead bullets i would
consider it effectual for pretty nearly anything that
a weapon of self-defense is ever used for and you
can slip in an extra magazine in the time it takes
you to put one shell in the big revolvers

  just a little hint when going to an argument with
adversaries of homicidal tendencies wear a big
revolver openly at your belt and a smaller one on
the opposite side of your body under a coat as
long as you dont reach for the big fellow your
opponent will not suspect you and you can get the
drop on him without much trouble in case he proves
warlike this is given in waller winanss work
on revolver shooting and seems to be good advice
so i pass it over

rifles

  american-winchester savage marlin rem-
ington stevens newton and the hand-made
weapons of adolph of genoa new york these
arms are modem ones in the course of manufacture
some of the older ones whose manufacture has been
discontinued are as follows spencer henry
sharps howard robinson maynard peabody
whitney kennedy ballard bullard allen fore-
hand  wadsworth hopkins  allen star merril
smith ward-hutton colt wesson joslyn evans
and blake more modem ones now off the market
are the remington-lee lee straighpull standard
and blake

  english-b s a westlcy-richards rigby jef-
fery webley  scott purdy lewis  sons lan-
caster and greener pretty nearly every english
gunmaker made rifles of one sort or another but
did not always place their name on the gun ross
rifles are made in canada are excellent

  german-mauser mannlicher and double and
single barrel tip-up actions are met with mauser
commercial actions are sold by the mauser works to
gunmakers in every country and by these makers
stocked and finished to be sold as their own make
mannlidiers the same

  austrian-mannlicher the standard arm but the
schoenauer is a popular and excellent action

  france spain italy and russia have distinctive
military rifles but their sporting weapons are

almost all imported ones from germany and the
united states scandinavian countries use the
krag-jorgensen service arm

actions

   omitting s as not worth consideration the
leading actions of the world are as follows

   winchesters lever and automatic actions at pres-
 ent bolt actions were made in - and 
 calibers both now discontinued shotguns are
 slide lever and automatic

   savage rifles are lever action in all sizes above 
 except the  high-power which is a lever action

   marlins are lever action in everything above 
 rimfire in power their shotguns are all slide or
 pump actions

   remington rifles are slide and automatics bolt
actions and single-shots have been discontinued
shotguns are pump and automatics revolvers
and pistols have been discontinued

  newtons are the latest comer in the firearms
line and are probably the best we have they are
powerful bolt actions no short arms made

  fred adolph of genoa makes fine arms to
order by hand having learned his art in germany
he ludwig wundhammer and w wilshirc of
los angeles california produce nothing but high-
grade arms made to the order of the sportsmen

   colts formerly made repeating rifles in both lever
 and slide actions and double-barreled shotguns but
 have not made any of these arms for years they
 make no automatic rifle

  the henry spencer and sharps with the old
springfield needle gun helped civilize the west
they were popular and reliable weapons the
first two were rimfire repeaters the latter was a
heavy single-shot center-fire rifle sharp made a
repeater and offered it to the government testing
department but it was rejected and i do not think
it was ever on the market sharps pistols were
made in four-barrel types also but for small car-
tridges the sharp by the way was the first
reliable breech-loading weapon we ever had in-
vented according to bannerman in 

   i do not consider the hall breech-loadcr rifle a
 practical arm as a number of men lost their thumbs
 by its blowing open it was invented about 

   english rifles are made in a great variety of styles
 and actions from the old snider to the latest type
 of bolt action for tlie high-power cartridges for big-
 game shooting the favorites are the bolt action
 and the double-barreled rifle they are made in
 calibers ranging from  savage high-power to the
  caliber and the  bore i can not manage to
 recount all the different calibers and cartridges as
 some of the same shells are known by a different
 name with every maker

   english shotguns are made in double and single
barrel styles the automatic is made i have read
but has never met with favor they are not strong
for a multishot gun there

   the english revolvers i do not know much about
but the webley is the service weapon and from
what i have seen of them they are a reliable gun
although very clumsy and of complicated design
i guess they deliver the goods

  as to the other european nations i am under
the impression that the bolt action is the standard
and this in fact is the only action that stands up
well under the terrific shock of the heavy loads of
smokeless powder now favored by big-game hunters
firearms old and new

american rifles are exported to a considerable extent
but more go to south america than to europe or
africa asia seems impartial from what i can learn

shotguns

  america makes the parker fox ithaca smith
winchester remington marlin union chicago
biffar davis folsom harrington  richardson
hopkins  allen tver johnson baker lefever
stevens royal and tobin winchester marlin
remington and union are pumps remington and
winchester are automatics all others are double
and single barreled both hammerless and hammer
styles are made with the former in the lead

  england-andrews anson bonehill halloway
naughton lancaster osborne pulverman web-
ley  scott lang westley richards and jeffery
all these are double and single barrels no re-
peaters to my knowledge some are made to handle
ball or shot equally well and are a favorite weapon
in a mixed-game field

  belgium-parkhurst browning pieper and
francotte browning is an automatic the rest are
double and single barrels

  germany-daly sauer and others i am not
familiar with three-barreled guns two-shot bar-
rels with a rifle barrel under and between them are
very popular a close friend of mine killed a game
warden with one i shall always believe he praised
its execution highly

  all the above double-barrel and single-barrel
guns are made in  gage and most of them in
  and  gages also automatics are 
gage in united states but a -gage browning
is made in europe

  now for my pets the short guns

revolvers

  america-colt smith  wesson iver johnson
harrington  richardson forehand and wads-
worth hopkins  allen meriden there are some
old-timers now discontinued that may figure in
stories so i list them starr remington bacon

  italy-brescia supposed  caliber

  the european makers produce so many different
automatics that it is not possible to keep up on
them i know an appalling number of patents are
granted upon this type of arm but how many are
actually manufactured and how successful they are
its impossible to state with any accuracy they
turn them out about as we do pocket-knives and
fords

  over there a great business is done by large firms
like the mauser works at oberndorff-on-neckar
where the rough forgings for frames and the rough
tubes for barrels are made and supplied to indi-
vidual makers all over the continent to be made
up into finished arms and labeled as the finishers
own product until the war the american makers
of shotguns imported practically all their high-grade
barrel-tubes and bored and finished them them-
selves incidentally our domestic tubes were far
superior to the imported article and the price was
mostly on the high-sounding foreign name

  now as regards ammunition i can not do all
i would like to as it would keep me as busy as a
blind paper-hanger with the dobie itch to get them
all down heres a little on the matter however

  american rimfire ammunition is made in 
          and 
calibers all over  rimfire are for obsolete
weapons however-old spencers henrys howards
etc

  as to the dates when these were introduced i can
give the following colts for fixed ammunition
about  winchesters the same year spencers
in  henrys in  volcanics in  these
were a lever-action arm made in repeating pis-
tols as well as rifles now very rare

  the springfield needle gun was issued as a breech-
loader in  but was not in general use till 
it was conceded to be hiyu cultus by the in-
dians who said shootum to-day killum tomor-
row it was as distinctive a weapon as the six-
shooter the old veteran served in the infantry
until  and some of the volunteers shouldered
it in the spanish war the cavalry used the
spencer till  then the springfield carbine the
same gun as the infantry but shorter

  winchesters came into general use about the
time of center-fire cartridges  they were the
favorite gun from that time on the winchester
company state that there are about a million of

hunting in alaska

  question-i am planning to go to alaska as
soon as the spring opens what hunting is there
to be done there in spring and summer re
hunting licenses necessary to possess and use fire-
arms if so how much would a license cost are
the mining regions open to a newcomer to stake a
claim what region would you advise could
you refer me to any book that explains the kind of
mining carried on there what caliber rifle do you
consider the best for that region-george
newman detroit mich

  annver by mr solomons-the hunting in
spring and summer is not so good of course as in
lall and winter but alaska is always a good hunt-
ing-ground though a big one and it is not easy to
get over the ground in summer however with
a poling-boat one can cover a great deal of ground
on the many rivers

  fur-bearing animals may be taken at the proper
season and under the moderate regulations in force
which you can obtain by writing the bureau of
fisheries washington d c game animals are
rather rigidly protected however including deer
moose caribou mountain sheep goats brown bear
-the big fellows-ducks geese ptarmigan and
oilier game birds this is for the market of course
and killings for personal use by miners or explorers
is sanctioned at any time

  a resident of alaska does not pay a license but

visiting hunters are taxed fifty dollars if americans
if foreigners one hundred dollars you may ob-
tain the game regulations and much general in-
formation by writing the geological survey or
department of the interior for general informa-
tion regarding the territory of alaska which mil
be sent you free of charge

  iprefer a - winchester for all round work in
alaska with soft-nosed bullets for quick use on big
bear and moose any high-powered rifle is good
but the lighter the better any one out looking for
the big brown bear or the silver-tip alaskan grizzly
would do well to take a somewhat heavier bore
rifle however good books for present-day use are
besides the numerous government publications
greelys hand-book of alaska-scribners-and
alaska an empire in the making by j j under-
wood-dodd mead  co

poor eyesight at sea

  question-i am twenty-one years old and have
a good healthy constitution but owing to short-
sightedness am obliged to wear glasses would
that be any obstacle in getting a position on a
vessel i can operate a typewriter have an ex-
cellent knowledge of bookkeeping and have had a
year in high school might i get a job as assistant
ask adventure

steward or something of that kind until i have
experience-edward guild adams mass

  answer by captain dingle-your defective
eyesight need not prove a bar to sea service entirely
although it is a bad asset for a man seeking to be-
come an officer you should have no difficulty in
getting some sort of a berth but it is not usually a
welcome thing aboard ship that a man is absolutely
obliged to wear his glasses while performing his
duties can you not work without them a
stewards job for example at least an assistant
steward consists in waiting on table and general
cleaning up that doesnt require excessively keen
vision but of course neither should a man be so
imperfect of vision that he would pass a passenger
sugar for salt

  in this regard go down to any steamer in your
nearest port and apply to the chief steward or
purser there are mvny jobs that a beginner can
take and after the first trip the rest is simple

  one other chance occurs to me and i think it is
your best method if you are able to do it glasses
wont matter there take a course in wireless
operating-the marconi company wool worth
building new york will tell you how and all
about it-then ship through these same people as
an operator youll rate as officer right away
have a good respectable job and it wont matter
how your sight is much so long as your ears are
keen

industrial conditions in victoria

  question-what are the industrial conditions
in victoria is there any demand for stenogra-
phers and newspaper men and what is the average
wage my wife is a stenographer and i am a news-
paper man what would be our chance of getting
by should we come to your country with a capital
of three thousand dollars or less the statement
that i am a newspaper man does not mean that
any kind of productive work would not look good
to me as i am in excellent health and physical con-
dition-kenneth f lee augusta maine

  answer by mr carson-you need have no
hesitation in coming to this country with the capital
you mention but while there are many good open-
ings for people of your stamp i very much doubt
if you will ever want them you can get a start
on a small ranch with what you have and one
season in this country will spoil you for indoor
employment forever just the same it is pleasing
to know that it is there in the event of your ever
needing it

  i am rather of the opinion that your chances
would be better in seattle if you decide to follow
your line of employment but this is a small matter
as the fare from seattle to victoria is only s
and the trip only requires some four hours by boat

  if you finally decide to try the coast i wish you
to feel that i stand ready to assist you in any way
i can it might be a good idea to come direct to
me and take a week to look things over before
committing yourselves to any particular line of
action dont turn on the gratitude flume i
have done this before as letters published in ad-
venture will show but i find the satisfaction of mak-
ing somebody come alive and really live is a big
return for any trouble i am put to i brought one
man from new hampshire and he has smiled ever
since glad to hear from you at any time and

i

any information i can give you is yours for the
asking

panama woods

  question-i am seeking information on the
country located on the north coast of panama be-
tween colon and bocas del toro relative to timber
possibilities in that section especially fronting on
the caribbean sea what is the character of the
timber and its principal growth or varieties com-
pared with cypress yellow pine oak and hickory
and if hard or soft varieties predominate what
are the health conditions and what altitudes are safe
for fair health what are the labor conditions
prevailing prices and if intelligent and competent
or not are the people reasonably law-abiding and
are the general laws such as would be favorable to
investments and general development-e c
austin st louis mo

  answer by mr young-besides the well-known
mahogany-swietenia-there are over a hundred
other timber trees having woods suitable for one
purpose or another in the forests of panama
prominent among these are the cedros-cedrela
sp-of which cedro amargo-c glaziovii-fur-
nishes cigar-box wood and a great deal of imitation
mahogany used by cabinet-makers

  other important lumbers are the numerous
quizarras which belong to the lauraceae the
guayacan-tecoma crysantha-one of the many
woods called lignum vitae the laurel-cordia
gerascanthus-and such leguminous trees as the
guanacaztli guapinol gavilan candelillos guachi-
pelin etc the guachiielin is very valuable for
posts foundations etc because when buried it re-
mains sound almost indefinitely and is not subject
to the attacks of insects

  to express it in a few words the forests of panama
are able to duplicate any character of timber we
have here and have left others with which we are
not familiar

  with the exception of malaria panama is healthy
in all parts and in the mountains the climate is ideal

  the panamanian native is worthless as a laborer
and all companies who operate in the republic im-
port west indian negroes for this purpose these
may be had for about a dollar a day and quarters
they are very stupid also and have to be driven
every minute of the time

  panama in all parts is very law-abiding and the
laws are favorable to investments with the excep-
tion of the san bias indian country a strip of land
between colon and colombia these indians are
about as ferocious as one would care to encounter

living conditions in california

  question-i would like to know about the
climate of california in general and los angeles in
particular i have heard that there is a long and
dreary rainy season in the state is that so
what are the working conditions in los angeles
particularly in the hotel business-waiters cooks
etc also what are the chances for a prospective
civil engineer is there much work in that line
either in los angeles or elsewhere in the state
are there good technical schools in the city where
one may finish out ones course what are the
conditions of life is the cost of necessities high
adventure



are rents very high and are the dwellings of the
lower middle class furnished with modem improve-
ments-frank pei new york n y

  answer by mr harriman-the climate of cali-
fornia in general is mild all the year where i live
our summers are far less heated than the eastern
and in winter-well to illustrate-i am sitting in a
chamber-room no fire going in any part of the
house my windows wide open and i without coat or
vest perfectly comfortable it is cool at times
occasionally we have frost and in summer our
nights are always cool allowing us perfect rest i
always sleep under one single blanket in summer

  regarding the long dreary rainy season we had
fifteen days in  when we did not have sunshine
at least part of the day could you endure that
there are parts of the state where they have fogs
and more cloudy weather up around san fran-
cisco for instance from santa barbara to mex-
ico it is about as here i have been here  years
and i wouldnt take new york as a gift if i had to
live there

  this is a great place for hotels and they are going
to be rushed to the limit from now on the tour-
ists are beginning to flock in from the frozen bliz-
zardy east and middle west filling everything
waiters and cooks are busy men here at this time-
january-and on till summer in fact they are
busy all the year but the first five or six months of
the year are the busiest

  civil engineers are not at a premium since our
schools turn them out by the score we have here
a superb school the l a polytechnic and our
manual arts is not far behind it i have been told
by eastern educators that our polytechnic ranks
with the best in america

  as regards living costs i am told by eastern men
now here that the meals in good places here cost
less than half new york prices one said only a
third as much a friend of mine went to boston
and wrote back that it cost him easily  mere to
feed his family there

  i ate dinner with a friend who knows the east as
i know my own yard and has traveled all over the
world he said as we ate-

  you set up a meal for fifty cents that i would
buy in new york at from one dollar to one-twenty-
five

  he also told me that he found clothing prices very
cheap and other things in proportion another
friend just back from chicago said he had a notion
that he could get a tailored suit more cheaply there
than here so he made a call on a tailor and ordered
two he said he lost about twenty-four dollars on
the two by not getting them here

  rents are all prices according to where you go
and the kind of house you rent i do not consider
them high in fact just the reverse

  the homes of even the sewer-diggers have modem
plumbing this city has more real homes for its
workers than any eastern city of its size i ever saw
and i have been in many of them here there are
literally thousands of small cottages and bungalows
prettily built with full modem plumbing fireplace
gas and electricity lawn in front and a garden in
rear occupied by laboring men and women

  i	have lived in minneapolis cleveland and other
towns in the middle west but i never saw such
pretty and comfortable homes for workers there
nor did i see anything like so many that owned
their own

the cook islands

  question-i am after information regarding
the cook islands in the southern pacific what is
the title of the representative of the british crown
there how are they governed is the white
population very numerous is the climate health-
ful please inform me as to the resources and in-
dustries of the islands-ottawan ottawa
canada

  answer by mr mills-the pacific group known
as the cook islands annexed by new zealand in
 include rarotonga mangaia mauke aitutaki
mitiaro and hervey islands palmerston niue
danger rakahanga manihiki penrhyn and su-
warrow the best known and most important of
these islands are rarotonga-which is the head-
quarters of the resident commissioner for the group
and the seat of the high court-mangaia and niue

  rarotonga promises to become a very important
position in the pacific ocean because it is one of the
stepping-stones on the greatest of all sea routes
from america to new zealand and australia it is
also to be an important wireless station it is
easily the finest of the cook group both in scenic
attractions and general productiveness being a
particularly good specimen of the volcanic order of
islands

  the island is well watered has a range rising over
 feet above the sea level and a belt of rich soil
varying from one to two miles in width extends all
round from the mountains to the sea the cir-
cumference of rarotonga is over  miles and the
total area  acres the coconut palm is ex-
tensively cultivated and there is a good orange and
banana trade with new zealand the island being
particularly well suited to the growth of the banana

  the population of this center of the cook group
is something over  natives-a very gentle and
kindly people well educated by the london mission-
ary society schools-and there are not more than
about  europeans the resident commissioner
is appointed by the new zealand government and
all the people in the group are governed by british
rule tempered of course by a wise and discretion-
ary use of native customs as is the case in new
zealand with regard to the maori-the native race

  by the way you will be interested to learn that
there is a contingent of maoris serving in flanders
with the new zealanders and a contingent of
rarotongans serving with the new zealanders in
palestine-all doing splendid war work for they are
ideal fighters the climate of the cook group is
healthy but of course it is pretty warm some
delicate friends of mine however have been resi-
dents of rarotonga these  years and are doing
well in health and pocket-kia ora maori for
good luck

trading in the orient

  question-what are the chances of making a
good living in china or malay peninsula by trading
working for companies etc what have you ever
heard of the interior of borneo i have heard that
it is peopled by a strange unknown race is this so
are they like the ainus or are they civilized yellow
men do you think that the oriental coolie
laborers or labor of all kinds should be excluded
from the united states what do you know of the
senussi-j o shahane cavalier n d
lost trails



  answer by mr mccreagh-it is difficult for me
to tell yno what chances you would have of making
a good living in china or the malay states since
you have not told me what your qualifications are

  if you are a skilled mechanic in any line you could
get employment with one of the large firms i
might be able to give you further particulars il you
would tell me what you could do

  as to trading i would advise you and every-
body else never to try to trade against the asiatic
races unless you happen to have enough capital to
swamp them out the white man can not trade in
a small way against the asiatic for the asiatic can
outbuy him outlie him and undersell him every
time remember the asiatic can live on about
one-tenth as much as the white man and can afford
to cut his profits correspondingly also there is a
strong race sentiment prevalent the asiatic will buy
from an asiatic whenever he can in preference to
a white man no you cant buck that game with-
out capital

  interior of borneo there has been written in past
years an awful lot of hot air about the wild and
mysterious people of the jungles as a matter of
fact they are nothing more than savages in a very
low state of civilization they represent what is
left of the original inhabitants muruts or dusuns
they are known as ethnologically distinct from the
dyak race they have some queer customs as
have all savages but there is nothing mysterious
about them they are not even cannibals though
they all collect heads just as the indian of this
country collected scalps

  they live largely on meat any kind of meat from
iguana lizard to wild pig or dog and they would just
as soon eat it raw as not the jungle communities
are always very small a village consists usually of a
single immense hut like a barrack with separate
cubicles for each family all the cubicles filthy

places in which ten or twenty people herd together
irrespective of sex open on to a wide sort of ver-
anda with a hard-stamped earth floor where the
bungalow-dweller of our summer colonies would

  an interesting item is their coinage-or rather
the recognized medium of exchange a large porous
earthen pot is currency for one pig or twenty
chickens or a pigskin full of yams and so on an-
other inteiesting fact is that all of them from
infants of three or four years of age get periodically
very drunk on a fiery liquor which they call murua
or bolo which they brew in some weird way out of
rice and fermenting bamboo shoots they get
drunk whenever they have a religious festival and
they hold a religious festival whenever it is necessary
to propitiate any of their numerous devils who live
in the trees and the streams and the rocks owing
to this high living and to some of their queer mar-
riage conventions they are gradually dying out-
and it isnt anybodys loss either

  do i think that oriental coolie labor should be
excluded from the u s a yes i do i think
that any form of labor which can underbid the
white man in his own country owing to a lower scale
of living should be excluded from a white mans
country

  the senussi i cant tell you much about the
senussi except that about them too a great deal of
foolishness has been written they are a semi-
political semi-secret organization of considerable

about them

how i improved my memory
in one evening

        the amazing experience of victor jones

  of course i place you mr
addison sims of seattle

  if i remember correctly-and i
do remember correctly-mr bur-
roughs the lumberman introduced
me to you at the luncheon of the
seattle rotary club three years ago
in may this is a pleasure indeed

i	havent laid eyes on you since that
day how is the grain business
and how did that amalgamation
work out

  the assurance of the speaker-in
the crowded corridor of the hotel
mcalpin-compelled me to turn and
look at him though i must say it
is not my usual habit to listen in
even in a hotel lobby

  he is david m roth the most
famous memory expert in the united
states said my riend kennedy
answering my question before  could
get it out he will show you a lot
more wonderful things than that
before the evening is over

  and he did

   as we went into the banquet room the
toastmaster was introducing a long line of
guests to mr roth i got in line and
when it came my turn mr roth asked
what are your initials mr jones and
your business connection and telephone
number why he asked this i learned
later when he picked out from the crowd
the  men he had met two hours before
and called each by name without a mis-
take what is more he named each
mans business and telephone number for
good measure

   i wont tell you all the other amazing
things this man did except to tell how he
called back without a minutes hesita-
tion long lists of numbers bank clear-
ings prices lot numbers pared post rates
and anything else the guests had given
him in rapid order



  when i met mr roth again-which
you may be sure i did the first chance i
got-he rather bowled me over by saying
in his quiet modest way

   there is nothing miraculous about my
remembering anything i want to remem-
ber whether it be names faces figures
facts or something i have read in a
magazine

    you can do this just as easily as i do
 anyone with an average mind can learn
 quickly to do exactly the same things
 which seem so miraculous when i do them

  my own memory continued mr
roth was originally very faulty yes
it was-a really poor memory on meet-
ing a man i would lose his name in thirty
seconds while now there are probably
 men and women in the united
states many of whom i have met but
once whose names i can tell instantly on
meeting them

   that is all right for you mr roth
i interrupted you have given years to
it but how about me

   mr jones he replied i can teach
you the secret of a good memory in one
evening this is not a guess because i
have done it with thousands of pupils in
the first of seven simple lessons which i
have prepared for home study i show you
the basic principle of my whole system
and you will find it-not hard work as you
might fear-but just like playing a fasci-
nating game i will prove it to you

   he didnt have to prove it his course
did i got it the very next day from his
publishers the independent corporation

   when i tackled the first lesson i sup-
pose i was the most surprised man in
forty-eight states to find that i had learned
in about one hour-how to remember
a list of one hundred words so that i could
call them off forward and back without
a single mistake

   that first lesson stuck and so did the
other six

   read this letter from c louis allen
who at  years is president of a million
dollar corporation the pyrene manufac-
turing company of new york makers of
the famous fire extinguisher

     now that the roth memory
   course is ilntshed i want to tell
   you how much i have enjoyed the
   study of this most fascinating sub-
   ject usually these courses involve
   a great deal of drudgery but this
   has been nothing but pure plea-
   sure all the way through i have
   derived much beneht from taking
   the course of instruction and feel
   that i shall continue to strengthen
   my memory that is the best part
   or it i shall be glad of an op-
   portunity to recommend your work
   to my friends

   mr allen didnt put it a bit too strong
the roth course is priceless i can ab-
solutely count on my memory now  can
call the name of most any man i have
met before-and i am getting better all
the time i can remember any figures i
wish to remember telephone numbers
come to mind instantly once i have filed
them by mr roths easy method street
addresses are just as easy

   the old fear of forgetting you know
what that is has vanished i used to be
scared stiff on my feet-because i
wasnt sure x couldnt remember what
i wanted to say

   now i am sure of myself and confident
and easy as an old shoe when i get on
my feet at the club or at a banquet
or in a business meeting or in any social
gathering

   perhaps the most enjoyable part of it
all is that i have become a good con-
versationalist-and i used to be as silent
as a sphinx when i got into a crowd of
people who knew things

   now i can call up like a flash of light-
ning most any fact  want right at the
instant i need it most i used to think
a hair trigger memory belonged only
to the prodigy and genius now i see
that every man of us has that kind of a
memory if he only knows how to make it
work right

   i	tell you it is a wonderful thing after
groping around in the dark for so many
years to be able to switch the big search-
light on your mind and see instantly
everything you want to remember

   this roth course will do wonders in
your office

   siiice we took it up you never hear any-
one in our oflice say i guess or i think
it was about so much or i forget that
right now or  cant remember or i
must look up his name now they are
right there with the answer-like a shot

   have you ever heard of multigraph
smith real name h q smith division

pany ltd in montreal here is just a
bit from a letter of his that i saw last

   nutshell mr lioth has a most re-
   markable memory course it is
   simple and easy as falling olt a log

   yet with one hour a day of practice
