zombies living dead men emaci-
ated mortals without a soul-raised
from graves by satanic power and
driven to toil by the will of a merciless
tyrant-for greed and power

  hokum says science death will not sell
its heritage even to the devil drugs sus-
pended animation hypnotism-of such
things are zombies

  but have you ever seen a zombie many
men have such men do not scoff-they
run for they sense the ungodliness of
zombie eyes-the atmosphere of hell that
permeates the presence of these things be-
yond the grave who neither talk nor eat
nor bleed when torn apart

corpses of corruption

  haiti inner china-eye-witness accounts
by those who do not want to talk afraid
of the demonic power which might reach
out to fasten uncanny fangs on those who
tell too much even starving rats and
wolves of china shrink from these corpses
of corruption nor will the snakes of haiti
strike at these walking things which defy
poison

 haiti- a united states marine
lost in the swamp given up for dead by
his comrades forced to seek refuge with
natives preparing for black magic he
would have become a human sacrifice to
the zombie god had he not at one time
saved the life of a wounded native and
now this native pleads for the white marine
-and he is allowed to see but never tell-
under penalty of what he knows would be
worse than torture

 but he has now spoken to one he can
trust the zombie god will understand
because this one in whom he has confided
does not scoff nor seek to punish by man-
made laws

unholy discord

  the night is dark-the wet mist of an
eerie fog rises like the breath of hell from
the stinking swamp where reptiles crawl
and wait to devour insects which venture
into the night tom toms accompany a
weird incantation of unholy discord as
tiny lights appear on surrounding hillocks

  then a stronger light looms up in the
depths of the swamp-a fire before a crude
altar ready for the kill the smaller lights
of single torches begin to move like fire-
flies slowly converging on the altar fire

until they are dimmed by the greater light
and then go out

  the assembly is ready the master a
giant native clothed in filthy shroud steps
forward and stands before the altar the
black skin of his fiendish face smeared
with rancid oil and blood shines in the
firelight-and his eyes gleam like pools of
phosphorus

  the incantations grow louder broken
only by mumblings of a demonic ritual

the sacrifice

  a scream the sacrifice a young virgin
her body writhing like a captured python
as it is carried to the altar by two naked
blacks each holding a leg and an arm of
the victim

  the sight of the altar and the fire is too
much for the terrified girl she swoons
voices stop but the tom toms pound with
increased fury

  the great moment has arrived

  gently the quivering body is laid upon
the blood-stained altar the master steps
forward-a knife flashes-and the body is
still the tom toms stop as though in si-
lent respect for the departing soul of this
child of sacrifice no sounds save the
crackling of the fire and the noise of in-
sects

 the master withdraws his knife and
raises his hands above his head instantly
voices mumble and the tom toms once more
begin their dirge of death

sinister operation

  down again comes the knife-this time
slowly the incantations continue then
with the precision of a surgeon the master
cuts into the breast of the girl slowly
carefully he removes the heart he drops
the knife and takes the bleeding heart in
the hollow of both his hands and holds it
before him

  all but the master drop upon their faces
in supplication none sees what the master
does with the heart for when the natives
come to their feet again the heart has dis-
appeared somewhere in the folds of that
filthy shroud rests the cherished organ of
a girl who might have found love

but the ceremony is not over although
the swamp is now quiet the body of the
girl is quickly removed authorities must
never find it the master steps away from

the fire-and the natives not more than
twenty of them line up behind him there
is a job to be done before dawn disturbs
the blackness of this night of hell

a marked grave

 zombie another zombie for the
master for days prior to this festival of
evil a grave has been marked-a grave
where rests the body of a strong man who
died in the prime of life he must live
again and this time work for the master

  the unholy procession soon arrives at
the designated grave by this time the
moon has risen the master halts no
words are spoken    only queer move-
ments of fingers and lips the master steps
back the men come forward crude
shovels appear and soon the wooden box
which houses the corpse pronounced dead
by a white mans doctor is opened

  death looks up into the moonlight it
matters not if rigor mortis has stiffened
the body or if putrefaction has brought a
stench beyond white mans endurance-the
corpse is lifted by strong arms and stood
up on its feet in front of the master

  the master then grasps the hand of the
corpse and holds the body upright before
him then the followers fall prostrate and
watch no more

  only the master speaks but his words
are a whisper his other hand passes over
the head and face of the man perhaps
buried for weeks

  there is a sickening gurgle stronger
than the rattle of death and this sound
comes not from the master but from the
thing before him

a zombie is born

  the master still holds the hand of the
corpse but not for long the dead man
is standing alone his eyes open but in
those eyes are no longer a look of human
intelligence    but a vacant stare of a
soulless creature without consciousness or
the breath of god

 another zombie is born a compact
with hell-deaths bargain for the virgin
sacrificed to the devil who knows

  i dont believe it says the skeptic
it might have looked true but the man
wasnt dead he had been drugged by the
so-called master perhaps some strange
drug known only to the witch-doctors of
haiti this drug might have the power
to suspend animation stop the heart and
lungs sufficient to fool any doctor maybe
the drug would soften the brain and then
when the master dug him up days later
another drug was administered and the man
came back to life-his mind a blank an
imbecile-not a zombie

john who was employed by a french
planter says the frenchman i saw john
die of pneumonia he was pronounced
dead by the doctor-and before we could
bury him rigor mortis had set in and his
body turned green i saw him buried

  three weeks later my son said he saw
john working in a field back in the hills
but john seemed deaf and dumb

  in order to quiet my son i investigated
the man looked like john even to the
scar on his cheek and the pock mark on
his nose but john didnt know me he
seemed to look right through me with the
expression of an imbecile no it couldnt
be john john was in his grave of course
it was possible for two men to look alike
even to similar scars-but this man didnt
have johns expression

  i dismissed the thought but my son was
not convinced he had heard too much
about zombies so i secured permission
to open johns grave we dug the grave
was empty

  but someone must have learned about
my secret investigation for when we went
to claim johns body-he was missing the
native owner knew nothing about him he
said we must have been dreaming or see-
ing a ghost

  and the skeptic replies of course they
were dreaming perhaps the grave was
robbed by body snatchers who sold it to
medical students for dissecting purposes

a strange experience

  but-how about the japanese corporal
who confidentially revealed his strange ex-
perience in northern china to an english
friend within the past year here is the
story

  for many miles northwest of peiping
a japanese regiment had advanced finally
nearing the objective not far from mon-
golia but before they could reach this
point they had to pass through a small
mountain village situated in a tiny valley
the road was narrow bounded by two hills
which commanded the road on the cliff-
like sides of these two hills were huge
rocks ideal for machine-gun nests which
could mow down any soldiers entering the
village

  there were several of these nests and
many japanese soldiers had been killed
finally the japanese commander brought
up his artillery and gave orders to blow
those machine-gun nests to bits they
were demobilized any chinese gunners
in them were buried under a pile of rocks
and debris all but one heavy shells
could not stop this gun which kept firing
whenever any japanese soldiers came into
view

  something had to be done to silence that
gun finally a japanese corporal with one
man was ordered to climb the rear of the
hill and try to sneak down on the chinese
gunner and destroy him



  the whole regiment waited an hour
passed then the corporal and his man
were seen crawling on their bellies down
from the top of the hill they had to be
careful the slope was steep

 it was an intense moment if the
chinese gunner saw them he would be
able to swing his gun around and exter-
minate them with ease

  but the gun kept shooting at the road
below whenever a japanese soldier ap-
peared in the open the japanese pur-
posely coaxed the fire so the gunner would
not notice the men creeping down behind
him

tense moments

  it was not until the corporal was fifty
feet away that he could barely see the
chinese gunner protected under a heavy
arch of rocks sitting at his gun which
pointed through a small opening

  the corporal was afraid to hurl a hand
grenade for fear that the explosion might
loosen the dirt beneath his own body and
he and his man would slide to death and
it would be difficult to throw a grenade
in the small archway furthermore the
gunner was so protected that even a pistol
shot would have to be too accurate there
wasnt enough of the body exposed to view
no-the only way was to knife him or
shoot him at close range

  suddenly as the corporal crawled closer
a small rock under him gave way it
rolled down the slope and bounced on the
archway

  the japanese corporals heart almost
stopped from -fear if the gunner heard
it and looked around it would be sure
death for the japanese

  but the gunner didnt budge he seemed
to be glued to the spot his eyes on the
opening in front of him

  forty feet    thirty feet    twenty
   ten    they were upon him now
to rush him the corporal drew his gun
and the private grabbed his trench knife
in readiness

  both men jumped at the same time and
inches away the corporal shot the chinese
in the back while the private plunged a
knife into the filthy neck the gunner
seemed to slump over his gun from the
force of impact-and the two japanese
satisfied they had killed him jumped to the
top of the archway and shouted to their
comrades

  a cry of victory went up from the troops
below as they ran into the road in answer
to the brave corporal

  but something was wrong the gun sup-
posed to be silenced began firing again
and several japanese soldiers dropped in
the road below

  the corporal infuriated dropped behind
the archway and this time hurled a hand
grenade tearing head and arms from the
chinese gunner

what frightening force in
clintons brain wove the

  by robert bloch

author of the curse of the house feast in the abbey etc

the real horror lay in the
fact that harry clinton was
just an ordinary college boy

  he sported a disreputable suede
jacket the left under-arm well-worn
from the rubbing of the textbooks he
carried he was given to whistling
popular song hits and he owned
most of the latest swing phono-
graph recordings he drove a non-
descript car and worried about the
price of gasoline he played basket-
ball on the second team he liked
ketchup on his hamburgers he-oh
well he was an ordinary college boy
just one of thousands and yet he
knew grinning fear

  harry clinton had gone to west-

ern tech for two years when pro-
fessor baim began his experiments
like the other students in psychol-
ogy  clinton participated in the
initial trials it was just a routine
matter nothing more

 professor baim was interested in
the rhine experiments-the duke
university studies in extra-sensory
perception he summarized his in-
tentions to the psych  class briefly
at the outset

 the rhine experiments were an
effort to determine the laws of
chance and their relation to human
guesses

  youve heard of hunches and in-
tuition and telepathy baim told his

scarlet pattern of his
mysterious fate

strange stories

class the first day well heres
your chance to find out what its all
about i have here a pack of twenty-
five playing-cards they are special
cards-five suits of five each there
are five stars five circles five squares
five sets of wavy lines and five
crosses they are single black line
figures on a white background and
these five were more or less chosen
for their simplicity and their sym-
bolic association with ordinary con-
scious and subconscious images

  is that clear enough five sets
of cards square circle cross star
wavy lines ill pass these sets out and
allow you to examine them

 he did so and harry clinton
looked at the little cards with the
rest professor baim continued

  the basic idea in using these
cards is simple the operator holds
one of them up to the subject with
only the back visible the subject
closes his eyes allows his mind to
become a blank then he calls out
the name of the first of the five sym-
bols to cross his consciousness he
may actually seem to see a square or
a circle or a star as the case may be
perhaps the operator and the subject
are seated back to back so that there
is no possibility of facial expression
or eye reflection on the part of the
operator informing the subject or
giving him a hint

i

the class exhibited tepid interest
clinton included

  according to the experiments the
score of correct guesses in most
cases is five this seems natural
enough because if you were to go
through the deck of twenty-five and
call out star each time youd have to
be right five times since there are
five cards in each of the five suits

  but-and this is a very large but
-in the course of these experiments
it was discovered that some students
were able to guess perhaps ten or
twelve cards correctly upon repeat-
ing the tests over a period of days
many achieved scores of fifteen or
even twenty certain people seemed
peculiarly apt guessers while the
scores of others varied from high to
low there were some who persist-

ently turned in the same or nearly
the same high score

  this has led to the setting up of
a theory of extra-sensory perception
-an unknown quantity which may
or may not account for certain peo-
ple having the knacks in making
hunches or foreseeing the future or
even for receiving telepathic com-
munications

  harry clinton was thinking about
betting on football games

  certain students submitted to
months of testing it was discovered
then that odd effects on their scor-
ing ability could be brought about
by getting them drunk or by testing
them when they were fatigued or
excited or stimulated some of them
scored higher when told they were
making progress others dropped
woefully

  it was ascertained that guessing
ability has nothing to do apparently
with the actual intelligence of a per-
son

  but-and this is important-the
variance of reaction under differen-
tiated forms of stimuli implied that
there was a definite power affected-
rhine has chosen to call this power
the power of extra-sensory percep-
tion i believe that professor rhine
has shown the way to opening up
new frontiers of the human mind
and with your permission i should
like to call upon a few volunteers
today-

  clinton was one of the five chosen
he watched three others sit blind-
folded in a chair while professor
baim held up the cards one by one
and waited for them to call out a
symbol he sorted the cards into
piles of correct and incorrect guesses

  clinton noticed that the first sub-
ject a girl guessed very swiftly
the second hesitated often the
third went quite fast for a space
slowed down and regained speed to-
ward the end

  clinton sat in the chair placed the
warm blindfold over his eyes and
began guessing

  square - circle - circle - star-
square - curly line - star - cross -
cross-curly line-cross-no thats a
square-now a cross-circle-
death has five guesses



  he felt queer it was hardly his
own voice droning it was hardly his
brain that saw in the darkness the
rapid flickering images of circles and
squares and stars and curly lines and
crosses something directed him
made him speak he completed the
test in forty-two seconds

baim said nothing he discoursed
on individual peculiarities men-
tioned how some guessers were fast
others slow others erratic he also
intimated that memory that is the
knowledge that one had already
called star five times and conse-
quently would not call it again dur-
ing the same testing-might subcon-
sciously influence the guessing

  a real definitive score he said
can be obtained only after seven
consecutive tests ah-mr clinton
would you care to go through the
pack again six times for the benefit
of the class

 clinton agreed sat down in the
chair again

 the images came swiftly

  the period bell rang as the tests
were concluded and the students
trooped out

  baims bulky figure leaned close as
clinton rose and removed his ban-
dages

 mr clinton id like to have a
word with you

  yes professor

  mr clinton i should very much
appreciate your working with me
this semester on these tests your
initial scores i might say are-ah
remarkably high this might be a
fluke an accident but any extraor-
dinary ability should be cultivated
of course this will be credited to
your regular work you know

 why sure why not say what
is my average anyway

 twenty-three mr clinton an
amazing twenty-three

 clinton worked with professor
baim for months the experiments
broadened in their technique new
methods were employed one night
baim called clinton on the phone
and requested him to guess the cards
over the wire they worked in sep-
arate rooms for several days worked

with screens between them worked
in total darkness conducted the
tests with telegraph keys and called
the guesses in french and german
it made no difference clinton
showed his remarkable aptitude
throughout

  at first for clinton it was a lark
then it became a problem to wonder
over after a time it reached the
stage of a competition a battle of
wits against the unknown and
finally during the third month it was
drudgery

  baim was writing a monograph on
his work with clinton although the
professor endeavored to repress his
enthusiasm clinton knew that he
was highly pleased with the venture

  the extra-classroom nature of the
studies kept clinton very busy
baims demands on his time and his
insistence on undertaking tests at
odd hours and under odder circum-
stances began after a while to annoy
him

  there were days when clinton
went through the deck thirty times
running he grew sick of the sym-
bols exasperated even the surpris-
ingly high percentage of totally cor-
rect scores no longer seemed a
worthy goal to him despite all the
work he understood no more of his
unusual power or ability than he had
at the beginning he merely closed
his eyes and the pictures came the
five symbols loomed up almost au-
tomatically

  he tried guessing ordinary play-
ing cards and failed miserably he
lost two dollars on the home team
in a football game he had no luck
in guessing examination questions
undoubtedly this peculiar sixth
sense was uncontrollable

  by the conclusion of the third
month it was worse than that he
left his daily tests with headaches
he began to experience periods of
moody irritability moreover he had
a tendency to forget trifles and de-
tails a sort of mild amnesia seemed
to steal over him at times so that
he was unable to account for his
actions for half-hours at a time

  usually after his testing periods
he would have difficulty in concen-


strange stories

trating on anything else for quite a
while the symbols stuck with him
and closing his eyes he would invol-
untarily conjure up images of
crosses and stars and curly lines and
squares and circles they floated in
his head and when he opened his
eyes again an hour had passed some-
how

  this got worse clinton told no
one for he himself did not quite
know what was the matter but in
the middle of may he suddenly ex-
perienced an attack of amnesia which
lasted for three days

	   

t was so hard to think

  harry clinton-that was his
name-had gone into a room and
now his hands were around some-
thing soft

  he had done many things in the
past three days and somehow he
couldnt think just what they were
or rather a part of him didnt want
to remember what they were they
had been bad things

  was he at home in the rooming-
house in his own bed was this all
a nightmare

  no it was real he was standing
with his hands around something
soft and three days had passed

  three days of school of study
of work why couldnt he remember
them

  it was even hard to see he felt
as though his eyes were closed as
though he was taking the tests-
guessing at the brightly-colored
mental pictures of crosses stars
curly lines squares and circles

  that was why he couldnt remem-
ber it had something to do with
the tests and the way they had af-
fected him lately

  he must think back now for a
week or so he had been taking forty
turns through the deck a day pro-
fessor baim had asked him to as a
final experiment to be written up for
his almost completed monograph
each days testing had left him with
a terrific headache

  more than that he had been un-
able lately to shake off the recur-
ring visions of the five symbols he

would leave the college and one or
more of the symbols would come and
stay in his brain he would fall
asleep thinking of the cross and
awake with the same thought static
in his mind that had caused his
memory lapse but where was he
now

  he stared down again at his hands
and gasped as mists cleared

 he-harry clinton-remembered
he remembered that first evening
when he had thought he was going
to be sick and had stepped into the
alley he had leaned over the refuse-
box as consciousness dissolved into
a swirling mist but now he could
recall what happened

  he had leaned over the refuse-
box had gazed into it and seen what
lay at the bottom two broken sticks
lay there probably torn from some
packing-crate they lay there one
atop the other-and they had formed
a cross

  a cross clinton had picked them
up-that is his hands had done so
clinton himself did not exist there
were only hands and something
guiding them which was not clinton
or clintons brain-some alien force
that felt drawn to the symbol of the
cross the hands picked up the
sticks fumbled about in the trash-
box for a length of wire bound the
sticks into a permanent crucifix-
shape then clintons body had
walked down the narrow alley and
clintons eyes had kept looking at
the base of the cross where the
stick was broken and ended in a
jagged point clintons eyes had
gloated

 but clinton himself had hated
what he was doing because he did
not understand and hated the other
part of consciousness which drove
him to fashion a symbol he wished
to forget so that as he walked he
grew very angry every time he
closed his eyes the cross was there
in his forehead

  it was burning up there just the
way it did when clinton guessed
the cards at school only there were
no cards this time and still the cross
remained the memory was haunt-
ing him making him do absurd
death has five guesses



things like fashioning this wooden
crucifix with the pointed end if
only clinton could forget the cross
he closed his eyes quite tightly
lurching down the alley wishing
that the two crossed iron bars against
his brain would go away he must
not see the cross-

  clinton opened his eyes and saw
the man coming down the alley from
the opposite direction it was dark
but the moon was up and he saw
that the man wore black skirts for
a moment he feared he was delirious
and then he realized the truth it
was a priest coming near he saw
the moonlight pick out a glittering
pattern on the priests chest a glit-
tering pattern-of a cross

 the golden cross dangled it
swayed from side to side as the
priest walked the moon was cruelly
bright so that its rays made of the
crucifix a blinding blur clinton
looked and could not tear his eyes
away but he wanted to he wanted
to with all his soul he did not want
to do what he-

  and then clinton stepped over to
the priest just as he passed and
from behind his back he drew the
wooden crucifix with the pointed
end and drove the point straight
into the priests chest

  he walked away his empty hands
clutching at the air with a sort of
joy born of the fact that they were
empty they no longer held the

cross there was joy in his mind
too for it was empty of the symbol
which when normal he so deeply
respected but which in his dream-
like state of abnormality obsessed
him no cross now only that tin-
gling emptiness-his whole brain was
empty and free

 harry clinton went home and
slept slept gratefully without
dreams for he was empty and when
he awoke he had forgotten the night
before with the cross and the priest

  in the class the next day when
the cards were called clinton scored
only seven two squares had come
two circles one curly line and two
stars but no cross never during
the entire test had he called out a
cross or thought of one

  there were times when his eyes
closed he had almost consciously
tried to conjure up the vision of the
cross in his mind he had failed
he knew that there were five cross-
marks in the pack of twenty-five
and yet in honesty he could not call
aloud an image that he did not see

  this clinton now remembered

me remembered the following day
-the day he guessed the five
stars correctly it was the day of
the astronomy lecture too had that
affected him he wondered

  he had called the five stars cor-

strange stories

  he walked through the cool streets
of dusk his feet moving automati-
cally along unbidden paths thoughts
refused to come he stopped in at
a drug store and bought some as-
pirin then meandered along the
streets again he had not wanted to
go to his room he caught himself
straining to hear the sound of cars
passing the conversation of others
in the street for some reason he
was particularly anxious to be amidst
noise and lights and people-any-
thing that might arrest his attention
and ease the ache in his temples
the ache that was all dull nothing-
ness in which a bright star blazed

  erratic footsteps followed his gre-
garious urge until he was moving
along downtown the welcome
clangor of street-cars began to fade
and only constant blinking enabled
him to keep his eyes open abnor-
mal nictation seemed the sole salva-
tion at the moment when now even
sounds failed to hold his attention

gratefully he had entered the
vaudeville theater sunk into a
loge seat and willed himself to watch
the final reels of the motion picture
flashing across the screen at the
conclusion he experienced a nasty
shock when the trademark of the
producing company flickered into
view with its crest of five stars the
theater was nearly deserted at sup-
per-hour and in the darkness harry
clinton fought a losing battle with
the five-pointed image that thrust
itself again and again between his
inner eyes and his outer vision of
the screen

  the brassy orchestra heralded the
stage show and for a few minutes
clinton again knew peace

 but the star act-clinton had
winced when the master of ceremo-
nies announced the turn as such-was
the personal appearance of a movie
queen

 the whole thing was madness
movie star-she swept onto the stage
against a background of a glittering
silver-foil star garishly lighted the
five silver points gleamed painfully
and clinton could not move his eyes
away the image mocked him and

the blonde girl before it undulating
about the stage in sequins seemed a
part of the star itself

  clinton bit his hand to keep from
screaming

  his mind groped for a thought-
any thought to hold his attention to
swerve it from the thought which en-
gulfed him and in the darkness he
lost

  he rose to his feet and started
down the aisle before the act was
over no longer was he conscious
aware of thought or action he
passed the boxes and entered the
passageway which led backstage
some part of him was moving slowly
cautiously all he saw was a great
glittering star-a star which was em-
blazoned on his mind and which ob-
truded between any other image and
reality he must get rid of the star
in his mind

  cautiously he moved along the de-
serted backstage corridor the act
was over the hallway momentarily
deserted he walked slowly down
toward the door under the light
paused before it

  there was a gold star on the door
of the dressing-room its five points
were saw-teeth biting into his brain
he stared at it then pushed the door
open

  the blond girl vas sitting at her
dressing-table eating clinton did
not see her he saw a star

  there was a heavy blunt-ended
mirror on the table there was a
large sturdy walking-stick in the
corner clinton did not see them
he saw a stage-property artificial
mace in a wall-stand its head was
studded with five-points a star
clinton ignored the other weapons
walking slowly he seized the mace
as the door closed behind him

  the girl turned around clinton
saw the star burn brighter she rose
said something clinton saw the
star move closer it was close enough
to reach now some part of him
held the mace and then dream
fused with reality as he brought the
mace down one two three four
five times-each time a point fell
away from the core of torment in his
brain then there was only a blur
death has five guesses



that became red red as the pool on
the floor where something lay

  clinton turned opened the door
walked out back through the passage
and resumed his seat in the theater
he must have fallen asleep for when
he awoke the last show was over
and the house-lights were going up

  he did not remember how he had
come to this place or what he had
done here and he did not think
about stars

  the next day in class he had re-
fused to take the test telling pro-
fessor baim that he was indisposed
at the time he did not know any
reason for doing so except that he
felt vaguely tired and incapable of
effort

  he asked to be excused early and
went home he did not even read
the papers had he done so he might
have seen the accounts of the mys-
terious death of father pornelski
who had been murdered by an un-
known religious fanatic two days
before he could have read of a
second murder which was already
making national headlines the
strange death of a well-known mo-
tion picture actress

harry clinton was oblivious
to all he only knew that he
felt tired and quite unaccountably
he did not wish to continue with the
extra-sensory perception experiments
they had given him these recent
headaches and peculiar lapses of
memory he felt sure today he was
glad that his mind was free once
in his room he lay back in the win-
dowless gray and almost revelled in
the blankness of his brain

 funny-since taking up these
psych experiments hed thought a
hell of a lot about his own mind
before that he had never even known
he had one oh well it was pleas-
ant and soothing here closing his
eyes he watched the two dancing
lines of parallel curlicues-two gray
curly lines wriggling before his
naked brain two curly lines what
did they remind him of

  sally

  of course sally sallys curly
hair he sure was forgetful these

days-why he hadnt seen sally for
over a week mrs johnson the land-
lady had left a note under his door
three days ago saying that sally had
called the night he was out some-
where walking off his headache the
poor kid she was worrying about
him why had he neglected her
that way

ow that he thought of it-
thought of gray lines-he could
not stop this psych stuff was sure de-
veloping his concentration all right
it seemed as though he just had to
go and see sally she would be
home now thursday afternoon her
biology lab period was over at
eleven on thursdays he must drop
in and surprise her he had to sur-
prise sally sally with the curly
yellow hair two curls in back
long golden curls old-fashioned
girl curls

  he was already walking down the
street turning up a light misty
rain was falling and glancing into
the street clinton noticed the tread-
markings caused by the tires of a
skidding car they left two curly
lines he was going to see sally

  one block more the curly lines
they got mixed up with his thoughts
of sally two golden caterpillars on
her neck on her white neck two
curly lines

  ring the bell no one in open
the door her room is in front

  curly fringes on the carpet be-
neath his feet curly fingers knock-
ing on the door curly lines of two
red lips to kiss

  oh harry-where have you been
ive worried so-

  curls on her neck think about
sally not the curls

 what are you staring at you
look-funny

  must feel the curls dont want
to but must cant think until they
are felt

  cant think at all   

  it was only after touching the
curls that harry clinton did begin
to think it was then that he re-
membered everything-the death of
the priest and the star and the ob-
sessive mingling of sally and the


strange stories

curly lines clinton thought of all
these things because he had been
shocked into doing so-shocked by
gazing down at his own hands clutch-
ing sallys curls sallys curls which
his hands had wound about her neck
and tightly pressed to strangle her
to death

  clinton knew then even as he ran
through the streets he knew he
could think only too clearly now
he was in the grip of some obsession
concerning the five symbols on the
extra-sensory perception cards the
strain of guessing those symbols
with closed eyes day after day for
months in a variety of experiments
his facility in conjuring up the
proper mental images-these things
had induced some abnormal condi-
tion whereby one or more of the
symbols now came to his mind with-
out conscious effort to recall any
it was sheer habit to think of a star
a cross a curly line a square or a
circle

 telepathy-what was it what
peculiar force in the brain aided him
in his guessing was it a psychic
power or an alien intelligence
prompting him

  whatever the cause the matter
had passed all controllable bounds
he was helpless to fend off the
power of the symbols for symbols
they had become

  when preyed upon by the recur-
ring image of the cross he had en-
countered the priest and some part
of his brain had identified the holy
man with the cause of his torment
he had killed the priest to erase
from his mind the cross symbol
and had not instinct guided him to
choose a symbolic weapon

  in the vaudeville theater he had
seen the star out of several weap-
ons in her dressing-room he was
prompted by the symbolism of the
mace-head

  was he actually guilty of such
crimes or was he a dual person-
ality some subconscious murdering
impulse had guided him very cun-
ningly in the execution of his kill-
ings was he insane

  he must have been to kill sally
good god he had killed her that

was why he was running no one 
had seen him her curly hair two
curly lines on her neck writhing
through his brain-he was forced to
erase the crawling curly lines from
memory symbolically he did so
with her death

  that was another thing he had
not taken the test merely thinking
of sally this last time had caused
identification and there was still
the circle and the square to go
would he murder two images of
transference because of them

  he panted with exhaustion lying
on the bed in his room would he
murder two more what could he
do to prevent it

had to drop psych that was cer-
tain and keep from anything
which might even vaguely be asso-
ciated with the last two symbols he
could not he fancied play poker
any more with the three boys down
the hall they sat at a square table
and there were four of them it
might suggest the square or the
chips might suggest the circle a
fat man could evoke the circle image
or even the phrase a square-
shooter applied to some man was
liable to set him off

  yet he needed a square-shooter
he had to tell someone about this
that was the way they did it in
psychiatry wasnt it the old idea
of the confessional whom could he
trust whom could he tell he
would state the case hypothetically
of course and get the dope straight
but whom

 professor baim yes baim was
the logical man he knew about all
this clinton would have to see him
to drop the class anyway and per-
haps baim knew of a way out

  there had to be a way out at once
murders could not continue he was
going crazy it was all insane and
at any minute the torturing images
might recur to blot out all thought
and sanity

 why not go now

  clinton rose and walked swiftly
out of the room out of the house
down the street to the campus
square
death has five guesses



  it was four oclock

 he had murdered sally at two-
thirty

 it was an absurd thought an
hour and a half ago he had mur-
dered a woman now he was going
to-what was he going to do oh
yes see baim good old baim he
would know a way to help his
classes were over hed be working
in his office

  the wide office door loomed before
him it was very wide almost
square

 clinton walked in baim was sit-
ting at the desk his square shoul-
ders hunched over-

 oh no mustnt think of squares

  hello professor

  dont think about the square jaw

  i wanted to talk to you

 think of something else quick
whats he doing oh yes he has
the cards out on the desk why-the
cards are square

 your cards are square profes-
sor

hat was he saying the cards
are square professor baims
cards are square professor baim
taught me to think of squares pro-
fessor baim will play square with me
professor baim is a square

 whats the matter dont be
afraid professor

 professor square-no baim-hes
afraid hes backing away what
do i look like what am i doing
hes backing up to the window the
window think of the window for
gods sake think of anything but
professor baim is a square think of
the window

  the window is square

 baim is backed against the open
square window

  square against square

  square accounts

  professor i-

 hes falling twisting around
twisting-why he isnt square any
more hes all crumpled

 well that was easy its gone
simple now to get rid of that
damned circle

 clinton was almost happy as he
slipped out the side entrance he

walked slowly back to the room-
ing-house even listened to the news-
boy on the corner of hale and jef-
ferson shouting about the extra
reedalla bouta moider collichgoil-
foundead extraaah

 he didnt buy a paper he knew
all about the murder he knew all
about lots of murders but what
worried him was that he didnt know
about the next murder

 there had to be one there sim-
ply had to be one he must get rid
of the circle then hed be all right
again somehow he realized that
these things were not right but it
was all necessary a man couldnt
live when his brain was on fire with
incomprehensible images this pe-
culiar power of his-this psychic
power of guessing correctly-it was
somehow alien and evil

 poor old baim had he actually
realized the full extent of the forces
he had tampered with there was
certainly a lot to it he hadnt sus-
pected must have had his suspicions
though when he went out the win-
dow perhaps he knew now

  this stuff was all from across the
border clinton didnt know and
couldnt control it funny idea
suppose this was really some extra-
sensory perception of his this
guessing faculty hed developed
suppose it were and that it was
not meant for men something or
some one might guard it or per-
haps this faculty merely opened up
a new part of the mind in such a
way that the old mind was unable
to govern or control the actions of
its augmented self

 there was dark stuff here and
clinton didnt want to tamper with
it do the murder get rid of the
last image forget about it all-erase
the circle and be free

  whom to sacrifice

 the moonfaced husband of mrs
johnson the landlady rogers the
kid with the shaved head and the
round skull

 the circle is the symbol of in-
finity eternity all life is a circle
curved space curved existence
round round and black

  up the stairs around to the room


strange stories

  think deliberately of the circle
so that it may provide a key to the
way out release the brain

  this would be a planned deliber-
ate murder why not there was a
gun in the drawer a gun

  clinton took out the gun filled it
with round cartridges gazed down
the round hole in the muzzle

  he was trying hard to think of
the person he meant to kill and
strangely no thought came although
by this time he could see the circle
quite plainly in his mind and for
the first time he actually rejoiced
in the pain the blazing circle
coruscated swirling round and round
and round as he looked down the
dark round muzzle of the gun

 it was then that he heard the
sounds from below and the tramp
of footsteps on the stairs

  sluggishly he realized the truth
they were coming for him after
all four murders-he was in a daze
must have left many clues they
were coming for him now

 but they couldnt come they
couldnt lock him up now not now
when the circle was squeezing tightly
around his brain he must get rid
of the circle first find peace be-
cause they would shut him away for
the rest of his life in a madhouse

and he couldnt stand it there with
nothing but the thought of the cir-
cle they were coming up the stairs

 who what clinton rose and
stepped forward wildly gun in hand
the circle of his room

  something bright arrested his at-
tention something bright and round
like the circle in his head he tried
to see it yes yes he could see
it it was the mirror-the silver cir-
cle of the mirror over his bureau
he stared into it

  in the silver circle he saw himself
-his own round head

  the knocking on the door came

  but clinton stared into the silver
circle at his own round head clin-
ton stared into the dark circle of the
gun-muzzle he put the round muz-
zle to his round head and looked
into the round mirror as though for
confirmation

  yes it was right

  open in the name of the law

  he had found the fifth symbol it
was the circle of life-back to him-
self he was the last symbol once
he erased that he could find peace

  harry clinton sent a circular bul-
let into his circular brain

  whatever the source of his extra-
sensory perception he had guessed
right at the end

ask for this quality ken-
tucky straight bourbon its
easy on your pocketbook

 ll right here we are said
f- major crosby halting

-	he glanced briefly at

the four men who formed his body-
guard and then turned to young
henley

 now henley he said i dont
want any interruption from you im
going to handle this thing myself
understand you know how much
influence these native witch-doctors
have and its no go angering them
needlessly and logodas a bad one
-he and his filthy heads

henley flushed beneath his bronze
one of those heads may be all thats

 left of my brother he said shortly

logoda knows too much to bother
an englishman returned the major

my brotjier knew his magic he
knew too much of his magic said
henley staring through the bushes
toward the squat hut of the witch-
doctor logoda

 well for gods sake dont start
 anything

the major started forward but
henley caught his arm

 wait major he said

 what is it crosby snapped

 talk to him in his own language
 said henley

logodas

heads

the dead are dumb
but in the jungle
their tongues
gibber-

logoda
turned to-
w a r d the
dried heads
ringing out
his arms as
ii in entreaty


strange stories

 i havent mastered the native
tongue yet returned the major
crossly

  i didnt mean that said henley
significantly

  oh said the major startled for a
moment then he shook his head
moodily and strode on across the
clearing with henley at his heels

  a few natives scattered warily as
they came on leaving the door to
logodas hut clear there was a col-
lection of trophies about the en-
trance  some of them were not pleas-
ant to look at major crosby reflected
briefly upon englands inability to
stamp out certain practises then he
turned and curtly ordered his men
to stay outside

 major crosby lifted the matted
doorway and went inside followed
by henley it took them a minute to
get used to the darkness then they
saw logoda-and the ugly stained
heads dried and strung along on
poles above the witch-doctors head

  major crosby had been in the hut
once before not so very long ago
there were ten heads then now
there were eleven the additional
one in the light of bob henleys dis-
appearance made him uneasy

   ogoda an ungainly hulking
mla man sat on his haunches in a cor-
ner he wore an odd head-dress ap-
parently hastily put on at the inti-
mation of visitors but apart from
this and a few streaks of none too
fresh paint he looked very little
different from his fellow natives
yet the man was a very tangible and
irritating power to the english sta-
tioned at the nearby post

  logoda a white man is missing
said the major coming directly to
the point of his visit he was known
to have come in your direction a
week ago seven days seven times
the sun he came this way where
is he

 no white man said logoda se-
renely

 he moved the upper half of his
body slightly forward so that his
outflung arms came to rest on palms
pressed flat against the ground

  no white man he said again
logoda crosby replied sternly
many men will come to search they
will burn your village they will put
you in a room with many bars
surprisingly henley interrupted
youre wasting our time major i
told you to talk to him in his own
language will you let me talk to
him

  no snapped the major angrily
im convinced youre needlessly
worried weve no actual proof that
your brothers dead and theres-
once again henley interrupted
him im going to look at those
heads he said and before crosby
could stop him he stepped forward

  instantly logoda pointed furiously
at henley and shouted you go
way

  but henley paid no attention he
stood under the dried heads gazing
at them imperturbably mid logodas
furious mouthings and major cros-
bys nervous scrutiny

  suddenly henley caught his breath
and expelled it again with a sharp
hissing sound

  bob he muttered

  major crosby expostulated now
look here henley-logodas not had
time to dry a head only a week
hardly that

 henley looked at him you are
too new here major crosby he
said i know how quickly they can
dry them

 there was something about hen-
leys cold stare that stayed crosbys
angry words on his lips

  abruptly logoda crossed his hands
before his face bowed his head
quickly to the ground and turned to-
ward the dried heads flinging out
his arms as if in entreaty to them
his palms turned upward toward
them from his mouth issued a
stream of weird gibberings

  he is talking to the heads said
henley softly do not be surprised
if they answer

  you dont actually believe in this
tom foolery henley demanded the
major incredulously

  yes said henley simply i do
bob and i have studied it a long
logodas heads



time there is more in it than you
think

  logodas gibbering quickly ceased
for a moment there was complete si-
lence the major was about to stalk
out disgusted-

 then there sounded as if from
far away a shrill strange tittering-
it grew-it mounted-until it sounded
all about them    and then it sub-
sided-it subsided into a subdued
whispering which was lost grad-
ually lost in silence again

 above them logodas heads were

the majors skepticism was shaken
and he was trying not to show it

  will you do me this favor major
i will not bother you again on my
honor i want to talk to logodas
heads and i do not want him to hear
what i say to them

  the simplicity with which this re-
quest was uttered was in strange con-
trast to the wierdness of its content

 the major swallowed with some
difficulty and asked in a thick voice
will you go after that

  yes ill go then replied henley

coming in the next issue

the man who
was death ef j w

a complete novelet of

plus many other gripping tales of the uncanny

swaying back and forth though no
one had touched them

good god whispered the major

major said henley in a strong
voice will you take logoda out of
the hut for a minute or two i want
to be alone here

v ogoda sat smiling to himself
his eyes hrlf-closed rocking back
and forth a little like a drowsy joss

but i thought you promised-
stammered the major

nothing will be disturbed i
promise you logoda will have no
cause for complaint

but then why must he go out

  very well

  the major stepped to the doorway
and signalled to two of his men
knowing they would be needed to
move logoda who would certainly
not go of his own volition despite
his furious protests logoda was
dragged to the doorway where he
rose and walked so that his natives
might not see this indignity being
visited on him

  henley was left alone in the hut
and his whispering voice drifted eeri-
ly to major crosby and his men
who looked questioningly at each
other henley was speaking in a na-
tive tongue


strange stories

 only a few minutes elapsed then
henley stepped from the hut his
eyes glittering strangely and lo-
goda after glaring at him in mur-
derous fury entered his home again

  im ready now major said hen-
ley

 very well said the major in a
low voice

 the five men made their long way
back to the english post where they
arrived just in time for suppsr

 for a long time henley and the
major did not speak to each other
but over coffee at last henley spoke

 how much would you people give
to be rid of logoda he asked softly

  major crosby was startled but re-
solved not to show it a good deal
i think but if youre planning to
go back there to get him stop now
we could have potted him a long
time ago but for an englishman to
be seen anywhere around when a
witch-doctor dies suspiciously is cer-
tain to cause an insurrection-and a

nasty one

  will you guarantee me passage to
the coast pursed henley

  i told you it was impossible hen-
ley i need all my men here any-
way

  i didnt mean protection-i meant
money i have money waiting for
me in cairo-but thats a hellish long
way off i want to get there and i
havent enough money

  oh said the major softening i
had no idea well you dont have to
earn it he went on smiling now
im glad to be able to help you
out

 and get rid of me murmured
henley smiling too but theres
one more favor i want to ask of you
before i leave

 and that asked the major ap-
prehensively

 i want you to tie me to my cot
tonight and set a guard over me
said henley grimly

 what an extraordinary request
exclaimed major crosby

  nevertheless an earnestly meant
one will you major

  well  if you insist and will
you go then in the morning

  yes

  i feel very odd about this said
the major some hours later as he sat
beside the cot to which henley had
been tied

  you neednt said henley shortly
im just protecting myself logo-
das afraid of me he isnt afraid of
you if youll forgive my saying it
he knows i know too much bob

did	too and bobs a dried head now
i have decided i dont want to die
and there are so many ways of bring-
ing about my death for a man like
logoda he could call me and i
would have to follow or he could
come himself-maybe a little white
dog or a snake-almost anything
thats the why of all this you see
really henley said the major
somewhat stiffly youre talking like
the most impossible madman i find
it difficult to believe that youre the
same man who has been so sane in
my company the previous weeks
yes i understand that said hen-
ley i know how you feel i am
sorry to disturb the waters like that
most of us like them smooth but
there are things like this and they
do happen bob and i have studied
them too long to deny them you
dont have to believe them-youd
probably be better off without know-
ing anything about them

hho made that laughter this
ww afternoon and who made
those heads sway like that asked
the major curiously and obviously
against his will

  i told you-logoda spoke to them
and they answered

  thats not telling me a thing re-
plied the major

  perhaps not thats the only an-
swer though now-forgive me-
ive got a long journey ahead of me
and ive got to get some sleep

  in the morning henley awoke to
find the major bending over him un-
tying the ropes that bound him

 good morning henley said
hope you slept well

  thanks said the major smiling
i didnt

  did anyone call for me in the
logodas heads



night asked henley his voice grim

 no one i watched for dogs and
snakes and things and even consid-
ered potting a couple of birds that
got lost in the clearing

 good old major thanks i think
it was too late for logoda to send
for me

 i suppose youll be leaving di-
rectly after breakfast asked the
major then

 i am expecting a message-and as
soon as it comes ill be on my way
from whom asked major crosby
bluntly

 that i cant say but you have
scouts out havent you

 of course said crosby shortly
 henley smiled

they were at breakfast when one
of the majors scouts came dodg-
ing out into the clearing he was ex-
cited and breathless from the exer-
tion of running

 theres my message i think
said henley calmly how about my
passage money major

 the scout came up to them lo-
godas dead he said jerkily hes
been killed i

 killed echoed the major good
god i hope there werent any eng-
lishmen around howd it happen

  the natives say his magic killed
him its a queer business sir his
guards didnt see anyone enter the
hut or anyone come out they heard
logoda talking to his heads and they
heard the heads answer then they
heard him cough once or twice and
finally he slept that was all this
morning he was found in his hut
with his throat torn out-terribly
mutilated cut and tom as if by thou-
sands of rats

  go back and find out whatever
else you can ordered major crosby

  the scout disappeared at once into
the jungle

 crosby turned to henley you
were on the bed all night henley i
know and you guessed logoda
would be killed who did it the
question came angrily

  i did said henley simply

  major crosby flushed nonsense
he snapped

  henley stood up smiling yet his
voice was grim

  i told you it wasnt good to know
about forbidden things but ill tell
you you heard logoda and those
heads and you will recall my insist-
ence on being left alone with them
logoda knew how to make them talk
and sway back and forth i knew
how to make them rend and tear i

strange stories

stood mocking rough taunts were
voices but for a time the white-
bearded oldster paid no heed to the
gibes his sunken eyes beneath
their snowy penthouse brows dwelt
on the far distance where a forest
swept up into the mountain slopes
and faded into blue haze

  his voice came thin piercing
wo wo unto sardopolis fallen
is jewel of gobi fallen and lost for-
ever and all its glory gone dese-
cration shall come to the altars and
the streets shall run red with blood
i see death for the king and shame
for his people   

  for a time the soldiers beneath the
wall had been silent but now spears
lifted they interrupted with a tor-
rent of half-amused mockery a
bearded giant roared

  come down to us old goat well
welcome you indeed

the prophets eyes dropped and
the shouting of the soldiers
faded into stillness very softly the
ancient spoke yet each word was
clear and distinct as a sword-blade

  ye shall ride through the streets
of the city in triumph and your
king shall mount the silver throne
yet from the forest shall come your
doom an old doom shall come down
upon you and none shall escape he
shall return-he-the mighty one
who dwelt here once  

  the prophet lifted his arms star-
ing straight into the red eye of the
rising sun evohe evohe

 then he stepped forward two
steps and plunged straight down
his beard and robe streaming up till
the upthrust spears caught him and
he died

  and that day the gates of sar-
dopolis were burst in by giant bat-
tering-rams and like an unleashed
flood the men of cyaxares poured
into the city wolves who slew and
plundered and tortured mercilessly
terror walked that day and a haze
of battle hung upon the roofs the
defenders were hunted down and
slaughtered in the streets without
mercy women were outraged their
children impaled and the glory of
sardopolis faded in a smoke of shame

and horror the last glow of the
setting sun touched the scarlet
wyvern of cyaxares floating from
the tallest tower of the kings palace

  flambeaux were lighted in their
sockets till the great hall blazed
with a red fire reflected from the
silver throne where the invader sat
his black beard was all bespattered
with blood and grime and slaves
groomed him as he sat among his
men gnawing on a rnutton-bone yet
despite the mans gashed and broken
armor and the filth that besmeared
him there was something unmistak-
ably regal about his bearing a kings
son was cyaxares the last of a line
that had sprung from the dawn ages
of gobi when the feudal barons had
reigned

  but his face was a tragic ruin

  strength and power and nobility
had once dwelt there and traces of
them still could be seen as though
in muddy water through the mask
of cruelty and vice that lay heavy
upon cyaxares his gray eyes held
a cold and passionless stare that van-
ished only in the crimson blaze of
battle and now those deadly eyes
dwelt on the bound form of the con-
quered king of sardopolis chalem

  in contrast with the huge figure of
cyaxares chalem seemed slight yet
despite his wounds he stood stiffly
upright no trace of expression on
his pale face

  a strange contrast the marbled
tapestried throne-room of the palace
was more suitable to gay pageantry
than this grim scene the only man
who did not seem incongruously out
of place stood beside the throne a
slim dark youth clad in silks and
velvets that had apparently not been
marred by the battle this was
necho the kings confidant and
some said his familiar demon
whence he had come no one knew
but of his evil power over cyaxares
there was no doubt

  a little smile grew on the youths
handsome face smoothing his curled
dark hair he leaned close and whis-
pered to the king the latter nodded
waved away a maiden who was oiling
his beard and said shortly

  your power is broken chalem
cursed be the city



yet are we merciful render homage
and you may have your life

  for answer chalem spat upon the
marble flags at his feet

 a curious gleam came into cy-
axares eyes half inaudibly he mur-
mured a brave man too brave to

die	  

  some impulse seemed to pull his
head around until he met nechos
gaze a message passed in that si-
lent staring for cyaxares took from
his side a long bloodstained sword
he rose stepped down from his dais
-and swung the brand

chalem made no move to evade
the blow the steel cut through
bone and brain as the dead man
fell cyaxares stood looking down
without a trace of expression he
wrenched his sword free

  fling this carrion to the vul-
tures he commanded

  from the group of prisoners near
by came an angry oath the king
turned to face the man who had
dared to speak he gestured

  a pair of guards pushed forward
a tall well-muscled figure yellow-
haired with a face strong despite
its youth now darkened with rage
the man wore no armor and his
torso was criss-crossed with wounds

 who are you cyaxares asked
with ominous restraint the sword
bare in his hand

  king chalems son-prince ray-
nor

  you seek death

  raynor shrugged death has come
close to me today slay me if you
will ive butchered about a dozen
of your wolves anyway and thats
some satisfaction

  behind cyaxares came a rustle of
silks as necho moved slightly the
kings lips twitched beneath the
shaggy beard his face was sud-
denly hard and cruel again

  so well you will crawl to my
feet before the next sun sets he
gestured no doubt there are tor-
ture vaults beneath the palace su-
drach

 a brawny leather - clad man
stepped forward and saluted you
have heard my will see to it

  if i crawl to your feet raynor
said quietly itll be to hamstring
you bloated toad

 the king drew in his breath with
an angry sound without another
word he nodded to sudrach and the
torturer followed raynor as he was
conducted out then cyaxares went
back to his throne and mused for a
time till a slave brought him wine
in a gilded chalice

 but the liquor had no power to
break his dark mood at last he
rose and went to the dead kings
apartments which the invaders had
not dared to plunder for fear of cy-
axares wrath above the silken
couch a gleaming image hung from
its standard-the scarlet wyvern
wings spread barbed tail stiffly up-
right cyaxares stood silently star-
ing at it for a space

 he did not turn when he heard
nechos soft voice the youth said
the wyvern has conquered once
again

  aye cyaxares said dully once
again through vileness and black
shame it was an evil day when we
met necho

 low laughter came yet you sum-
moned me as i remember i was
content enough in my own place
till you sent your summons

  involuntarily the king shuddered
i would ishtar had sent down her
lightnings upon me that night
ishtar you worship another god
now

 cyaxares swung about snarling
necho do not push me too far i
have still some power-

 you have ali power the low
voice said as you wished

 for a dozen heart-beats the king
made no answer then he whispered
i am the first to bring shame upon
our royal blood when i was
crowned i swore many a vow on the
tombs of my fathers-and for a time
i kept those vows i ruled with
truth and chivalry-

 and you sought wisdom

  aye i was not content i sought
to make my name great and to that
end i talked with sorcerers-with
bleys of the dark pool

 bleys necho murmured he


strange stories

was learned in his way yet-he
died

  the kings breathing was unsteady
i know i slew him-at your com-
mand and you showed me what
happened thereafter

 bleys is not happy now necho
said softly he served the same
master as you wherefore- the
quiet voice grew imperious where-
fore live for by our bargain i shall
give you all power on earth fair
women and treasure beyond imagina-
tion but when you die-you shall
serve me

  the other stood silent while veins
swelled on his swarthy forehead
suddenly with a bellowing inarticu-
late oath he snatched up his sword
bright steel flamed through the air
-and rebounded clashing up the
kings arm and through all his body
raced a tingling shock and simul-
taneously the regal apartment seemed
to darken around him the fires of
the flambeaux darkened the air was
chill-and it whispered

 steadily the room grew blacker
now all was midnight black save
for a shining figure that stood im-
mobile blazing with weird and un-
earthly radiance little murmurs
rustled through the deadly stillness
the body of necho shone brighter
blindingly and he stood without
moving or speaking till the king
shrank with a shuddering cry his
blade clattering on the marble

 no he half sobbed for his
mercy-no

  he has no mercy the low voice
came bleak and chill therefore
worship me dog whom men call
king worship me

 and cyaxares worshiped   

chapter ii
blood in the city

prince raynor was acutely
uncomfortable he was stretched
upon a rack staring up at the drip-
ping stones of the vaults roof and

sudrach the torturer was heating
iron bars on the hearth a great cup
of wine stood nearby and occa-
sionally sudrach humming under
his breath would reach for it and
gulp noisily a thousand pieces of
gold if you help me escape raynor
repeated without much hope

  what good is goto to a flayed
man sudrach asked that would
be my fate if you escaped also
where would you get a thousand
golden pieces

 in my apartment raynor said
safely hidden

  you may be lying at any rate
youll tell me where this hiding
place is when i burn out your eyes
thus ill have the gold-if it exists
-without danger to myself

  raynor made no answer but in-
stead tugged at the cords that bound
him they did not give yet raynor
strained until blood throbbed in his
temples and was no closer to free-
dom when he relaxed at last

  youll but wear yourself out
sudrach said over his shoulder
best save your strength youll
need it for screaming he took an
iron bar from the fire its end
glowed redly and raynor watched
the implement with fascinated hor-
ror an unpleasant way to die   

  but as the glowing bar approached
raynors chest there came an inter-
ruption the iron door was flung
open and a tall huge-muscled black
entered sudrach turned involuntar-
ily lifting the bar as a weapon then
he relaxed his eyes questioning

  who the devil are you he
grunted

  eblik the nubian said the black
bowing i bear a message from the
king i lost my way in this damned
palace and just now blundered to
my goal the king has two more
prisoners for your hands

  good sudrach rubbed his hands
where are they

  in the- the other stepped
closer he fumbled in his belt

  then abruptly a blood-reddened
dagger flashed up and sheathed it-
self in flesh sudrach bellowed
thrust out clawing hands he doubled
up slowly while his attacker leaped
cursed be the city



free and then he collapsed upon the
dank stones and lay silent twitching
a little

 the gods be praised raynor
grunted eblik faithful servant
you come in time

  ebliks dark gargoylish face was
worried let me- he slashed
the cords that bound the prisoner
it wasnt easy when we were
separated in the battle master i
knew sardopolis would fall i
changed clothes with one of cy-
axares men-whom i slew-and
waited my chance to escape it was
by the merest luck that i heard you
had offended the king and were to
be tortured so- he shrugged

 raynor free at last sprang up
from the rack stretching his stif-
fened muscles will it be easy to
escape 

 perhaps many are drunk or
asleep at any rate we cant stay
here

 the two slipped cautiously out
into the corridor a guard lay dead
weltering in his blood not far away
they hurried past him and silently
threaded their way through the pal-
ace more than once dodging into
passages to evade detection

 if i knew where cyaxares slept
id take my chances on slitting his
throat raynor said wait this
way

  at the end of a narrow hall was a
door which pushed open showed a
moonlit expanse of garden eblik
said i remember-i entered this
way here- he dived into a bush
ard presently emerged with a sword
and a heavy battle-ax the latter he
thrust in his girdle what now

  over the wall raynor said and
led the way the high rampart was
not easy to scale but a spreading
tree grew close to it and eventually
the two had surmounted the barrier
as raynor dropped lightly to the
ground he heard a sudden cry and
glancing around saw a group of
men armor gleaming in the moon-
light racing toward him he cursed
softly

  eblik was already fleeing his long
legs covering the yards with amaz-
ing speed raynor followed though

his first impulse was to wait and
give battle but in the stronghold
of cyaxares such an action would
have been suicidal

  behind the pair the pursuers bayed
menace swords came out flashing
raynor clutched his comrades arm
dragged him into a side alley and
the two sped on frantically search-
ing for a hiding-place it was eblik
who found sanctuary five minutes
later passing the blood-smeared
corpse-littered courtyard of a tem-
ple he gasped a hasty word and in
a moment both raynor and eblik
were across the moonlit stretch and
fleeing into the interior of the tem-
ple

 from a high roof hung a golden
ball dim in the gloom this was the
sacred house of the sun the dwell-
ing place of the primal god ahmon
eblik had been here before and
knew the way he guided raynor
past torn tapestries and overthrown
censers and then halting before a
golden curtain he listened there
was no sound of pursuit

  good the nubian warrior said
ive heard of a secret way out of
here though where it is i dont
know maybe we can find it

he drew the curtain aside and the
two entered the sanctuary of
the god involuntarily raynor whis-
pered a curse and his brown fingers
tightened cn his rapier hilt

  a small chamber faced them with
walls and floor and ceiling blue as
the summer sky it was empty save
for a single huge sphere of gold in
the center

 broken upon the gleaming ball
was a man

  from the wall a single flambeau
cast a flickering radiance on the
twisted bloodstained body on the
white beard that was dappled with
blood the man lay stretched across
the globe his hands and feet im-
paled with iron spikes that had been
driven deeply into the gold

  froth bubbled on his lips his
hoary head rolled eyes stared un-
seeingly he gasped water for
the love of ahmon a drop of water

  raynors lips were a hard white


strange stories

 line as he sprang forward eblik
 helped him as he pried the spikes
 free the tortured priest moaned
 and bit at his mangled lips but made
  no outcry presently he lay prostrate
 on the blue floor with a muttered
 word eblik disappeared and came
 back bearing a cup which be held
 to the dying mans mouth

   the priest drank deeply he whis-
 pered prince raynor is the king
 safe

   swiftly raynor answered the
 others white head rolled

   lift me up-swiftly

   raynor obeyed the priest ran his
 hands over the golden sphere and
 suddenly beneath his probing fin-
 gers it split in half like a cloven
 fruit and in its center a gap wid-
 ened a steep staircase led down
 into hidden depths

   the altar is open i cannot see
 well take me down there they
 cannot find us in the hidden cham-
 ber

   raynor swung the priest to his
 shoulders and without hesitation
 started down the steps eblik behind
 him there was a low grating as the
 altar swung back a gleaming sphere
 that would halt and baffle pursuit
 they were in utter darkness the
 prince moved cautiously testing each
 step before he shifted his weight
 at last he felt the floor level be-
 neath his feet

 slowly a dim light began to
 grow like the first glow of
 dawn it revealed a bare stone vault
 roughly constructed of mortised
 stones strangely at variance with the
 palatial city above in one wall a
 dark hole showed on the floor was
 a circular disk of metal its center
 hollowed out into a cup within this
 cup lay a broken shard of some rock
 that resembled gold-shot marble
 half as large as raynors hand on
 the shard were carved certain sym-
 bols the prince did not recognize
 and one that he did-the ancient
 looped cross sacred to the sun-god

   he put the priest down gently but
 nevertheless the man moaned in
 agony the maimed hands clutched
 at air

 ahmon great ahmon    give
me more water

 eblik obeyed strengthened the
priest fumbled for and gripped ray-
nors arm

 you are strong good strength
is needed for the mission you must
undertake

 mission

 the priests fingers tightened
aye ahmon guided your steps
hither you must be the messenger
of vengeance not i i have not
long to live my strength ebbs  

  he was silent for a time and then
resumed i have a tale to tell you
do you know the legend of the
founding of sardopolis how long
ago a very terrible god had his altar
in this spot and was erved by all
the forest dwellers    till those
who served ahmon came they
fought and prisoned the forest god
drove him hence to the valley of
silence and he lies bound there by
strong magic and the seal of ahmon
yet there was a prophecy that one
day ahmon would be overthrown
and the bound god would break his
fetters and return to his first dwell-
ing place to the ruin of sardopolis
the day of the prophecy is at hand
the priest pointed all is dark
yet the seal should be there-is it
not 

 raynor said a bit of marble-
aye-the talisman lift it up
the voice was now peremptory ray-
nor obeyed

  i have it

 good guard it well lift the
disk now

 almost apprehensively the prince
tugged the disk up finding it cu-
riously light beneath was nothing
but a jagged stone crudely carved
with archaic figures and symbols a
stone-yet raynor knew somehow
that the thing was horribly old that
it had existed from the dawn ages
of gobi

  the altar of the forest god said
the priest he will return to this
spot when he is freed you must go
to the reaver of the rock and give
him the talisman he will know its
meaning so shall ahmon be avenged
upon the tyrant   
cursed be the city



 suddenly the priest surged up-
right his arms lifted tears streaming
from the blind eyes he cried ohe
-ohe fallen forever is the house
of ahmon fallen to the dust  

 he fell as a tree falls crashing
down upon the stones his arms still
extended as though in worship so
died the last priest of ahmon in
gobi

 raynor did not move for a while
then he bent over the lax body a
hasty examination showed him that
the man was dead and shrugging
he thrust the marble shard into his
belt

 i suppose thats the way out he
said pointing to the gap in the wall
though i dont like the look of it
well-come on

 he squeezed himself into the nar-
row hole cursing softly and eblik
followed

chapter iii
the reaver of the rook

ith slow steps cyaxares paced
his apartment his shaggy
brows drawn together in a frown
once or twice his hand closed con-
vulsively on his sword-hilt and
again the secret agony within him
made him groan aloud but not once
did he glance at the scarlet symbol
of the wyvern that hung above his
couch

 going to a window he looked
down over the city and then his
gaze went out to the plain and the
distant forested mountains he
sighed heavily

 a voice said you may well look
there cyaxares for there is your
doom unless you act swiftly

 is it you necho the king asked
heavily what new shamefulness
must i work now

 two men go south to the valley
of silence they must be slain ere
they reach it

 why what aid can they get
there

  necho did not answer at first his
voice was hesitant when he said
the gcds have their own secrets
there is something in the valley of
silence that can send all your glory
and power crashing down about your
head nor can i aid you then i can
only advise you now and if you fol-
low my advice-well but act i can-
not and must not for a reason which
you need not know send out your
men therefore with orders to over-
take those two and slay them-
swiftly

  as you will the king said and
turned to summon a servitor

ffjoldiers follow us eblik
said shading his eyes with a
calloused hand he was astride a
rangy dun mare and beside him ray-
nor rede on a great gray charger red
of nostril and fiery of eye the lat-
ter turned in the saddle and looked
back

  by the gods he observed cy-
axares has sent half an army after
us its lucky we managed to steal
these mounts

  the two had reined their horses
at the summit of a low rise in the
forest back of them the ground
sloped to the great plain and the
gutted city of sardopolis before
them jagged mountains rose covered
with oak and pine and fir the nu-
bian licked dry lips said thirstily
the fires of all hells are in my
belly lets get out of this wilder-
ness where theres nothing to drink
but water

  the reaver may feed you wine-
or blood raynor said neverthe-
less our best chance is to find this
reaver and seek his aid a mer-
cenary once told me of the road

  he clapped his heels against the
chargears flanks and the steed
bounded forward in a moment the
ridge had hidden them from the
men of cyaxares so the two pene-
trated deeper and deeper into the
craggy desolate wilderness a place
haunted by wolves and great bears
and men whispered monstrous
snake-like cockadrills

  they went by snow-peaked moun-
tains that lifted white cones to the


strange stories

blue sky and they fled along the
brink of deep gorges from which
the low thunder of cataracts rose
tumultuously and always behind
them rode the pursuers a grim and
warlike company following slowly
but relentlessly

 but raynor used more than one
stratagem thrice he guided his
charger up streams along which the
wise animal picked its way care-
fully again he dislodged an ava-
lanche to block the trail so it came
about that when the two rode down
into a great grassy basin the men
of cyaxares were far behind

  on all sides the mountains rose
ahead was a broad meadow-like
valley strewn with thickets and
green groves far ahead the preci-
pice rose in a tall rampart split in
one place into a narrow canyon

  to the right of the gorge lifted
a great gray rock mountain-huge
bare save for a winding trail that
twisted up its surface to a castle
upon the summit dwarfed by dis-
tance the size of the huge structure
could yet be appreciated-a castle of
stone incongruously bedecked with
fluttering bright banners and pen-
nons

  raynor pointed he dwells there
the reaver of the rock

 and here comes danger eblik
said whipping out his battle-ax
look

  from a grove of nearby trees burst
a company of horsemen glittering
in the afternoon sunlight spears
lifted casques and helms agleam
shouting they rode down upon the
waiting pair raynor fingered his
sword-hilt hesitating

  put up your blade he directed
eblik we come in friendship
here

 the nubian was doubtful but
do they know that

  nevertheless he sheathed his sword
and waited till the dozen riders
reined in a few paces away one
spurred forward a tall man astride
a wiry black

  are you tired of life that you
seek the reavers stronghold he
demanded or do you mean to en-
ter in his service

 we bear a message raynor
countered a message from a priest
of ahmon

 we know no gods here the
other grunted

  well you know warfare or ive
misread the dents in your armor
raynor snapped sardopolis is
fallen cyaxares has taken the city
and slain the king my father chalem
of sardopolis

to his amazement a bellow of
laughter burst from the troop
the spokesman said what has that
to do with us we own no king but
the reaver yet you shall come
safely before him if that is your
will it were shameful to battle a
dozen to two and the rags you wear
arent worth the taking

  eblik started like a ruffled pea-
cock by the gods you have little
courtesy here for a coin id slit
your weasand

  the other rubbed his throat re-
flectively grinning you may have
a trial at that later if you wish my
ragged gargoyle but come now for
the reaver is in hall and tonight he
rides forth on a raid

 with a nod raynor spurred his
horse forward the nubian at his
side and surrounded by the men of
the reaver they fled across the val-
ley to the castle thence they
mounted the steep dangerous path
up the craggy ramp till at last they
crossed a drawbridge and dismounted
in a courtyard

 so they took raynor before the
reaver of the rock

  a great shining red-cheeked man
he was with grizzled gray beard and
a crown set rakishly askew on tan-
gled locks he sat before a blazing
fire in a high-roofed stone hall an
iron chest open at his feet from
this he was taking jewels and golden
chains and ornaments that might
have graced a kings treasury exam-
ining them carefully and making
notes with a quill pen upon a parch-
ment on his lap

 he looked up merry eyes dwelt
on raynors flushed face and touseled
yellow hair

  well samar what is it now
cursed be the city



 two strangers they have a mes-
sage for you-or so they say
suddenly the reavers face changed
he leaned forward spilling treasure
from his lap a message now
there is only one message that can
ever come to me    speak you
who sent you

aynor stepped forward confi-
dently from his belt he drew
the broken shard of marble and ex-
tended it

 a priest of ahmon bade me give
you this he said sardopolis is
fallen

  for a heartbeat there was silence
then the reaver took the shard ex-
amining it carefully he murmured
aye so my rule passes for long
and long my fathers held the rock
waiting for the summons that never
came and now it has come

 he looked up go all of you
save you two and you samar-
wait for you should know of this
the others departed the reaver
shouted after them summon del-
phia

  he turned to stare into the fire
so i kialeh must fulfill the ancient
pledge of my ancestors and in-
vaders are on my marches well-
there came an interruption a
girl strode in dark head proudly
erect slim figure corseted in dinted
armor she went to the reaver flung
a blazing jewel in his lap

  is this my guerdon she snarled
faith o the gods i took ossans
castle almost single-handed and my
share is less than the share of samar
here

  you are my daughter the reaver
said quietly shall i give you more
honor then in our free brotherhood
be silent listen

 raynor was examining the girls
face with approval there was beauty
there wild dark lawless beauty and
strength that showed in the firm set
of the jaw and the latent fire of the
jet eyes ebony hair unbound fell
in ringlets about steel-corseleted
shoulders

 the girl said well have you
had your fill of staring

 let be the reaver grunted i

have a tale for all of you    listen
his deep voice grew stronger
ages on ages ago this was a bar-
barous land the people worshipped
a forest-god called- his hand
moved in a queer quick sign-called
pan then from the north came two
kings brothers bringing with them
the power of the sun-god ahmon
there was battle in the land then
and blood and reddened steel yet
ahmon conquered

  the forest-god was bound within
the valley of silence which lies be-
yond my castle the two kings made
an agreement one was to rule sar-
dopolis and the other the younger
was to rear a great castle at the
gateway of the valley of silence
and guard the fettered god until a
certain word should come   
the reaver weighed a glittering
stone in his hand for there was a
prophecy that one day the rule of
ahmon should be broken then it
was foretold that the forest-god
should be freed and should bring
vengeance upon the destroyers of
sardopolis for long and long my
ancestors have guarded the rock-
and i kialeh am the last ah he
sighed the great days are over
indeed never again will the reaver
ride to rob and plunder and mock
at gods never-whats this

  a man-at-arms had burst into the
hall eyes alight face fierce as a
wolfs kialeh an army is in the
valley

  by shaitan raynor cursed
cyaxares men they pursued
us-

  the girl delphia swung about
gather the men ill take com-
mand-

  suddenly the reaver let out a
roaring shout no by all the gods
ive flouted-no would you grudge
me my last battle girl gather your
men samar-but i command
samar sprang to obey delphia

  then he was gone and curtains of
black samite swayed into place be-
hind him

  raynor was curiously eying the
girl her face was pale beneath its
tan and her eyes betrayed fear red
battle she could face unflinchingly
but the thought of entering the val-
ley of silence meant to her some-
thing far more terrible yet she
said come we have little time

  eblik followed raynor and del-
phia from the hall they went
through the harsh splendor of the
castle till at last the girl halted be-
fore a blank stone wall she pressed
a hidden spring a section of the
rock swung away revealing the dim-
lit depths of a passage

  delphia paused on the threshold
her dark eyes flickered over the two

  hold fast to your courage she
whispered-and her lips were trem-
bling for now we go down into
hell  

chapter iv
the valley of silence

ltet at first there seemed nothing
 jlterrible about the valley they
entered it from a cavern that opened
on a thick forest and glancing
around raynor saw tall mountainous
ramparts that made the place a
prison indeed it was past sunset
yet already a full moon was rising
over the eastern cliffs outlining the
reavers castle in black silhouette

  they entered the forest

  moss underfoot deadened their
footsteps they walked in dim gloom
broken by moonlit traceries filtered
through the leaves and now raynor
noted the curious stillness that hung
over all

  there was no sound the noise of
birds and beasts did not exist here
nor did the breath of wind rustle the
silent trees but queerly the prince
thought there was a sound whisper-

ing through the forest a sound be-
low the threshold of hearing which
nevertheless played on his taut nerves

  i dont like this eblik said his
ugly face set and strained his voice
seemed to die away with uncanny
swiftness

  pan is fettered here delphia
whispered yet is his power mani-
fest 

  soundlessly they went through the
soundless forest and now raynor
realized that slowly and impercep-
tibly the shadowy whisper he had
sensed was growing louder-or else
his ears were becoming more attuned
to it a very dim murmur faint and
far away which yet seemed to have
within it a multitude of voices   

  the voices of the winds    the
murmur of forests    the goblin
laughter of shadowed brooks   

 it was louder now and raynor
found himself thinking of all the in-
numerable sounds of the primeval
wilderness bird-notes and the call
of beasts   

 and under all a dim powerful
motif beat a wordless shrilling a
faint piping that set the princes
skin to crawling as he heard it

  it is the tide of life delphia
said softly the heart-beat of the
first god the pulse of earth

 for the first time raynor felt
something of the primal secrets of
the world often he had walked
alone in the forest but never yet had
the hidden heart of the wilderness
reached fingers into his soul he
sensed a mighty and very terrible
power stirring latent in the soil be-
neath him a thing bound inextric-
ably to the ijrain of man by the cords
of the flesh which came up by slow
degrees from the seething oceans
which once rolled unchecked over a
young planet unimaginable eons ago
man had come from the earth and
the brand of his mother-world was
burned deep within his soul

  afraid yet strangely happy as
men are sometimes happy in their
dreams the prince motioned for his
companions to increase their pace

  the forest gave place to a wide
clearing with shattered white stones
cursed be the city



rearing to the sky broken plinths
and peristyles gleamed in the moon-
light a temple had once existed
here now all was overgrown with
moss and the slow-creeping lichen

  here the girl said in a low whis-
per here   

  in the center of a ring of fallen
pillars they halted delphia pointed
to a block of marble on which a
metal disk was inset in a cuplike
depression in the metal lay a broken
bit of marble

 the talisman delphia said
touch it to the other

  silence    and the unearthly tide
of hidden life swelling and ebbing
all about them raynor took the
amulet from his belt stepped for-
ward fighting down his fear he
bent above the disk-touched marble
shard to marble-

  as iron to lodestone the two frag-
ments drew together they coalesced
into one the jagged line of break-
age faded and vanished

 raynor held the talisman-com-
plete unbroken

  now quite suddenly the vague
murmurings mounted into a roar-
gay jubilant triumphant the metal
disk shattered into fragments be-
neath it the prince glimpsed a small
carved stone the twin of the one be-
neath the temple of ahmon

  above the unceasing roar sounded
a penetrating shrill piping

  delphia clutched at raynors arm
pulled him back her face was chalk-
white

  the pipes she gasped back-
quickly to see pan is to die
louder the roar mounted and
louder in its bellow was a deep
shout of alien laughter a thunder of
goblin merriment the chuckle of
the shadowed brooks was the crash
of cataracts and waterfalls

  the forest stirred to a breath of
gusty wind

  back the girl said urgently
back we have freed pan

  without conscious thought raynor
thrust the talisman into his belt
turned and with delphia and eblik
beside him fled into the moonlit
shadows above him branches tossed

in a mounting wind the wild shriek-
ing of the pipes grew louder

  tide of earth life-rising to a mad
paean of triumph

  the wind exulted

  free    free

  and the unseen rivers shouted
  great pan is free

clattering of hoofs came
from the distance bleating
calls sounded from afar

  the girl stumbled almost fell ray-
nor gripped at her arm pulling her
upright fighting the unreasoning ter-
ror mounting within him the nu-
bians grim face was glistening with
sweat

  pan pan is free

  evohe

  the black mouth of a cavern
loomed before them at its threshold
raynor cast a glance behind him
saw all the great forest swaying and
tossing his breath coming unevenly
he turned following his companions
into the cave

  shaitan he whispered what
demon have i loosed on the land
then it was race sprint pound up
the winding passage up an unending
flight of stone steps through a wall
that lifted at delphias touch-and
into a castle shaking with battle
raynor stopped short whipping out
his sword staring at shadows flicker-
ing in the distance

  cyaxares men he said theyve
entered

  in the face of flesh-and-blood an-
tagonists the prince was suddenly
himself again delphia was already
running down the corridor blade
out raynor and the nubian followed

  they burst into the great hall a
ring of armed men surrounded a
little group who were making their
last stand before the hearth tower-
ing above the others raynor saw the
tangled locks and bristling beard of
kialeh the reaver and beside him
his lieutenant samar corpses lit-
tered the floor

  ho roared the reaver as he
caught sight of the newcomers you
come in time in time-to die with


strange stories

chapter v
cursed be the city

rim laughter touched raynors
lips he drove in sheathing his
sword in a brawny throat whipped
it out steel singing nor were eblik
and delphia far behind her blade
and the nubians ax wreaked deadly
havoc among cyaxares soldiers who
not expecting attack from the rear
were confused

  the hall became filled with a mill-
ing yelling throng from which one
soldier a burly giant emerged shout-
ing down the others

 cut them down theyre but
three

 then all semblance of sanity was
lost in a blaze of crimson battle
swinging brands and huge maces
that crashed down splitting skulls
and spattering gray brain-stuff del-
phia kept shoulder to shoulder with
raynor seemingly heedless of danger
her blade flicking wasplike through
the air and the prince guarded her
as best he could the sword weaving
a bright maze of deadly lightnings
as it whirled

 the reaver swung and his sword
crushed a helm and bit deep into
bone he strained to tug it free-
and a soldier thrust up at his throat
samar deflected the blade with his
own weapon and that cost him his
life in that moment of inattention
a driven spear smashed through
corselet and jerkin and drank deep
of the mans life-blood

  silent he fell

 the reaver went beserk yelling
he sprang over his lieutenants corpse
and swung for a few moments he
held back his enemies-and then
someone flung a shield instinc-
tively kialeh lifted his blade to
parry

  the wolves leaped in to the kill

 roaring the reaver went down
blood gushing through his shaggy
beard staining its iron-gray with
red when raynor had time to look

again kialeh lay a corpse on his
own hearth his head amid bright
jewels that had spilled from the
overturned treasure-chest

  the three stood together now the
last of the defenders-raynor and
eblik and delphia the soldiers
ringed them panting for their death
yet hesitating before the menace of
cold steel none wished to be the
first to die

  and as they waited a little silence
fell the prince heard a sound he
remembered

 dim and far away a low roaring
drifted to his ears and the eerie
shrilling of pipes   

  it grew louder the soldiers heard
it now they glanced at one another
askance there was something about
that sound that chilled the blood

  it swelled to a gleeful shouting
filling all the castle a breeze blew
through the hall tugging with elfin
fingers at sweat-moist skin it rose
to a gusty blast

 in its murmur voices whispered

 evohe evohe

 they grew louder mad and un-
checked they exulted

  pan pan is free i

 gods a soldier cursed what
devils work is this he swung
about sword ready

  the curtains of samite were ripped
away by the shrieking wind deafen-
ingly the voices exulted

  pan is free

 the piping shrilled out there
came the clatter of ringing little
hoofs the castle rocked and shud-
dered

 some vague indefinable impulse
made raynor snatch at his belt grip-
ping the sun-gods talisman in
bronzed fingers from it a grateful
warmth seemed to flow into his flesh
-and the roaring faded

 he dragged delphia and the nu-
bian behind him close to me stay
close

 the room was darkening no-it
seemed as though a cloudy veil of
mist dropped before the three guard-
ing them raynor lifted the seal of
ahmon

 the fog-veils swirled dimly
cursed be the city



through them raynor could see the
soldiers moving swiftly frantically
like rats caught in a trap he tight-
ened one arm about delphias steel-
armored waist

  suddenly the hall was ice-cold
the castle shook as though gripped
by titan hands the floor swayed be-
neath the princes feet

  the mists darkened through rifts
he saw half-guessed figures that
leaped and bounded    heard elfin
hoofs clicking horned and shaggy-
furred beings that cried jubilantly as
they danced to the pipes of pan   

  faun and dryad and satyr swung
in a mad saraband beyond the shroud-
ing mists faintly there came the
screaming of men half drowned in
the loud shrilling

  evohe the demoniac rout thun-
dered evohe all hail o pan

 with a queer certainty raynor
knew that it was time to leave the
castle-and swiftly already the
great stone structure was shaking
like a tree in a hurricane with a
word to his companions he stepped
forward hesitantly the talisman held
high

  the walls of mist moved with him
outside the fog-walls the monstrous
figures gamboled but the soldiers of
cyaxares screamed no more

 through a castle toppling into
ruin the three sped into the court-
yard across the drawbridge and
down the face of the rock nor did
they pause till they were safely in
the broad plain of the valley

  the castle eblik barked point-
ing see it falls

 and it was true down it came
thundering while clouds of ruin
spurted up then there was only a
shattered wreck on the summit of
the rock   

  delphia caught her breath in a
little sob she murmured the end
of the reavers for all time i-i
lived in the castle for more than
twenty years and now its gone like
a puff of dust before the wind

  the walls of fog had vanished
raynor returned the talisman to his
belt eblik staring up at the rock
swallowed uneasily

  well what now he asked

  back along the way we came the
prince said its the only way out
of this wilderness that i know of

  the girl nodded yes beyond
the mountains lie deserts save to-
ward sardopolis but we have no
mounts

  then well walk eblik observed
but raynor caught his arm and
pointed

  there horses - probably stam-
peded from the castle and-shai-
tan theres my gray charger
good

  so presently the three rode to-
ward sardopolis conscious of a
wierd dim throbbing that seemed to
pulse in the air all about them

at dawn they topped a ridge and
saw before them the plain all
three reined in their mounts staring
beneath them lay the city - but
changed

  it was a ruin

  doom had come to sardopolis in the
night the mighty towers and battle-
ments had fallen and huge gaps
were opened in the walls of the
kings palace nothing was left but a
single tower from which ironically
the wyvern banner flew as they
watched that pinnacle too swayed
and tottered and fell and the scarlet
wyvern drifted down into the dust of
sardopolis

  on fallen towers and peristyles
distant figures moved with odd un-
gainly boundings quickly raynor
turned his eyes away but he could
not shut his ears to the distant cry-
ing of pipes gay and pagan yet with
a faintly mournful undertone

  pan has returned to his first altar
delphia said quietly we had best
not loiter here

  by all hell i agree the nubian
grunted digging his heels into his
steeds flanks where now raynor

  westward i think to the sea of
shadows there are cities on its
shore and galleys to take us to a
haven unless- he turned ques-
tioning eyes on delphia

  she laughed a little bitterly i
cannot stay here the land is sunk


strange stories

back into the pit pan rules i go
with you

  the three rode to the west they
skirted but did not enter a small
grove where a man lay in agony it
was cyaxares a figure so dreadfully
mangled that only sheer will kept
him alive his face was a bloody
mask the once-rich garments were
tattered and filthy he saw the three
riders and raised his voice in a weak
cry which the wind drowned

  beside the king a slim youthful
figure lounged leaning idly against
an oak-trunk it was necho

  call louder cyaxares he said
with a horse under you you can
reach the sea of shadows and if
you succeed in doing that you will
yet live for many years

 again the king cried out the
wind took his voice and shredded it
to impotent fragments

  necho laughed softly too late
now they are gone

cyaxares let his battered head
drop his beard trailing in the
dirt through shredded lips he mut-
tered if i reach the sea of shadows
   i live

  true but if you do not you die

and then- low laughter shook the
other

  groaning the king dragged him-
self forward necho followed

  a good horse can reach the sea
of shadows in three days if you
walk swiftly you may reach it in
six but you must hurry why do
you not rise my cyaxares

  the king spat out bitter oaths in
agony he pulled himself forward
leaving a trail of blood on the grass
   blood that dripped unceasingly
from the twin raw stumps just above
his ankles

  the stone that fell upon you was
sharp cyaxares was it not necho
mocked but hurry you have little
time there are mountains to climb
and rivers to cross   

  so in the trail of raynor and eb-
lik and delphia crept the dying
king hearing fainter and ever fainter
the triumphant pipes of pan from
sardopolis and presently patient as
the silent necho a vulture dipped
against the blue and took up the pur-
suit the beat of its wings distinctly
audible in the heavy stagnant si-
lence   

  and raynor and delphia and eb-
lik rode onward toward the sea

   the fatal negative

by tally mason

author of the lost wraith

house of darkness etc

the second print was authentic but
the framed photograph had changed
again in the night

old wemyss gave him the
packet without question and
moncati stood politely lis-
tening to him his head cocked a
little to one side his bright dark
eyes were smiling coldly but his
thin lips remained devoid of any
movement

 i confess id have been afraid of
 your stepfather myself said we-
 myss there were some very strange
 stories about him and the man him-
 self always impressed me as some-
 thing evil

wemyss coughed nervously and
cast a glance over his shoulder to
where his law partner was at work
on a brief

belatedly lowering his voice he
added i admire your fearlessness
moncati

thank you said moncati and
left him

outside his lips smiled and he
said within his mind wemyss you
had the secret

 his hand tightened a little about
 the packet and the photograph in it
 this kind of blackmail would never
 have occurred to wemyss


strange stories

  as he walked through piccadilly
in the sunlight so unusual for lon-
don moncati held his smile and his
thoughts dwelt upon the photograph
and the occasion upon which he had
taken it about his stepfather we-
myss had put it mildly indeed mon-
cati himself had heard the old man
boast i am the lord of evil
proudly sure of himself

  moncati remembered it well and
had reason to believe it on natural
grounds wemyss had not been
wrong when he had warned him that
the old man had an eye on the legacy
coming to moncati at twenty-five
moncatis dabbling in photography
had saved his life-just as teddifer
his stepfather was preparing to leap
upon him fingers already curved for
his throat the flashlight bulb had gone
off

  moncati had risen from his simu-
lated sleep thrust teddifer away
and gone with the camera and film
he remembered yet the fury and
chagrin on the old mans face when
he had learned about moncatis elab-
orate precautions-but he remem-
bered too that already then he had
known that some day he would have
to take other steps

moncati paused to tear into
little pieces the letter that had
been with the packet for wemyss
which began in case of my death
please forward immediately to in-
spector winslow at new scotland
yard   and went on chuckling to
himself now light-hearted and gay
with eyes for every pretty girl he
met

  deep in his mind he was well sat-
isfied with himself as proud as old
teddifer had ever been of his magic
and necromancy and not a little
scornful of the evil old man who had
come to such a prosaic and untimely
end

  moncati felt not a qualm at re-
membering how carefully he had tied
the cord which had tripped teddifer
at the head of the stairs and left him
at the bottom with his scrawny neck
broken after all moncati had had
every provocation he had known
that by some design or other ted-

  difer had meant to accomplish his
death and take his legacy and the
thought had irritated and at last had
worried him into action if a fly
bothers me i kill it he had told
himself then why hot teddifer

  when moncati reached home he
unpacked the enlarged photograph
found a frame and hung the picture
on the wall squarely over his desk
so that he might remind himself
from time to time of his own clever-
ness in circumventing the evil old
man who had been his stepfather he
had already burnt up most of teddi-
fers books and papers and had be-
gun to rearrange the house to suit
his own convenience

  he went whistling up the stairs
and left the picture there in the
patch of sunlight on the wall the
evil-faced old man with head half
turned toward the hidden camera and
the flare that had surprised him
moncati himself in bed the glare of
light that made strikingly clear the
huge cruel old hands and the de-
signing mind behind the sunlight
was additionally merciless and there
the picture hung moncati in bed
and hercules teddifer about to reach
for his neck

  for some days the picture com-
forted moncati it gave him a deep-
seated feeling of contentment of sat-
isfaction with himself and the world
and he glanced at it smiling once or
twice a day then he went down to
sussex for a weekend and when he
came back he felt for the first time
a disquieting note about the picture
it was something intangible some-
thing upon which he could not put a
finger but it was there

  the photograph gave him the old
pleasure and satisfaction but there
was something more something ma-
levolent about it and he was irritated
to think he did not know what it
was for a brief moment he thought
that the old mans expression had
subtly altered become more calcu-
lating but being careful about his
imagination he dismissed the
thought

  two evenings later as he sat at
his desk writing a difficult letter he
glanced absently up at the photo-
lord of evil



graph and saw a movement there

  because the indirect light threw a
diffused glow over the picture he
thought at first that the movement
he had seen was a normal hallucina-
tion springing from the slight re-
focusing of his gaze from paper to
photograph but almost instantly his
eyes fixed unconsciously upon the
spot where he had thought the move-
ment to have been hercules teddi-
fers hands

 with a faint tremor he knew that
he had seen the old mans large bony
hands flex-open and close-and he
involuntarily waited fascinated for
the hands to move again but only
for a second he recollected himself
and turned the light full upon the
photograph a faint feeling of panic
guiding his hand

  he looked at it closely but noth-
ing happened there was nothing
changed about it and he suffered a
brief moment of distaste before he
felt the old pleasure creep over him
again the sense of proud security he
had made for himself by so fortunately
ridding himself of his menacing step-
father

 he sat down again presently and
resumed the letter but every little
while he caught himself looking ex-
pectantly up at the photograph
watching nervously and uncertainly
so that in the end he was obliged to
give up the letter somehow his
mind would not return to it would
not concentrate properly on the task
before it

  with a faintly derisive smile half
for himself half for the photograph
he left the desk

  he had no doubt that his eyes had
played a trick on him and he slept
well that night without dreams he
rose in the morning got at his letter
again and finished it without any
trouble

 on his way out of the house to
the victoria and albert museum he
gave the photograph a fleeting glance
with his customary good humor and
went whistling into the mornings
fog

 not until he was seated comfort-
ably in the underground did it occur
to him that hercules teddifers face

as he had seen it in the photograph
that morning was no longer turned
toward the hidden camera he had
not actually realized it at first but
his eyes had seen the image had
been transmitted and now suddenly
he remembered it with a certain def-
initeness which he found difficult to
escape

  the possibility of any physical
change in the photograph was too
absurd to entertain seriously he be-
gan to think very clearly around
what his eyes had seen in an attempt
to find some explanation of it but
the more he thought the greater his
confusion grew until he knew that
he must return to the house and as-
sure himself that such a change had
not actually taken place

  he made a mental note at the same
time to see about his eyes glasses
certainly were indicated

he let himself in the house with
trepidation and went directly
to the picture he looked and looked
again stepped back a little and
stared his mind in outraged tumult
there was a change the old mans
face no longer peered out at him in-
stead it had turned ever so slightly
and taken new cognizance of the fig-
ure in the bed the head bent a little
and the eyes lost in contemplation
it was incredible but it was true

  moncati took the photograph off
its hook and peered closely at it he
rubbed his fingers over it as if he
might feel some subtle difference his
eyes could not see but there was
nothing baffled he put it back and
stood looking at it for a long time
until he became conscious of the fact
that he was waiting for change to
take place there before his eyes

  then angry with himself he turned
away and went grimly out of the
house intending to complete the
days itinerary as he had set it for
himself but somehow before he
knew it the museum palled on him
and he found himself sitting down to
tea with old wemyss who eyed him
a little askance

  investment trouble asked the
barrister

  moncati shook his head no dan-


strange stories

ger of that ive just developed some
curiosity about my late stepfather
wemyss put on his pince-nez and
looked at him god bless my soul
he exclaimed whats put you in
mind of him now hes dead and
the worlds the better for it-you
particularly

  moncati smiled his most persuasive
smile agreed mr wemyss but i
have a reasonable amount of curios-
ity and id rather like to know some-
thing of the nature of those strange
stories about which you hinted the
last time i called on you

 wemyss eyes narrowed what
misguided impulse roused your cu-
riosity he asked

 moncati shrugged is it mis-
guided

  i hesitate to talk about things i
dont myself understand and yet
must put some belief in replied
wemyss because i dislike being
held up to ridicule even if only in the
private opinions of my clients i dont
suppose you believe in such things
as magic and sorcery eh

 moncati smiled pleasantly and
said only a fool refuses to keep an
open mind

 well said answered wemyss
shortly teddifer practised that
sort of thing-squares and circles
and spirit rites and such i dont
hold with it myself but i understand
that some very unusual occurrences
took place in that house of his

  wemyss shrugged a little irri-
tated but went on the best i can
say is that some people died very
oddly-servants two that i know
of both strangled but of course
your stepfather was out of the city
at the time no question about that
wemyss smiled a little oddly with
a kind of menace behind his lips
he had some queer theories about
the projection of psychic doubles
and astrals and the like for that
matter no one ever found any prints
of any kind on those two dead serv-
ants

 of a sudden wemyss gulped his
tea and was off saying over his
shoulder god bless my soul ive
forgotten my appointment with dot-
son

  moncati waved at his back but he
was puzzled the inference behind
wemyss words was clear enough
and somehow moncati could not get
his thoughts away from hercules
teddifers huge ungainly hands the
tough claw-like appendages that had
so greedily threatened his own throat
he shook himself presently paid for
the tea and wandered somewhat re-
lunctantly homeward

he looked at the picture but there
was no further change he
was conscious of a slight feeling of
relief but this was dissipated at
once in the memory of that first
change he took the photograph
down again and examined it anew
but could discover nothing remarkable
about it

  for the first time he began to be
aware of something akin to fear he
began to search his memory for some
clue to this strange occurrence and
at the same time he began to cast
around for some manner of escape
from the intangible dread he had be-
gun to feel insidiously drawing upon
him from the recesses of his mind-a
malignant dread akin to that same fear
he had known when first he had be-
come aware of his stepfathers evil
design to kill him

  doggedly he put the picture back
on the wall and went about his small
tasks by evening he had sufficiently
recovered his composure to contem-
plate coolly some means of combat-
ting the subtle dread that lay in the
back of his mind he could not re-
frain from looking at the picture
again but there was no further change
and he felt a renewal of faith in him-
self

  he had thought once fleetingly of
burning the picture but this seemed
to him somehow a reflection upon
the resourcefulness and courage that
had brought it into being and he
could not contemplate with equanim-
ity the resultant drain upon his self-
esteem

  throughout the evening he sat in
the room reading his desk light
thrown upward upon the picture
but nothing happened nothing what-
ever he had come almost to expect
lord of evil



some further development but this
absence of anything again set him
doubting what he had first seen

 had there been any change in the
first place or had his imagination
over-reached itself certain as he
was that the old man had first been
looking out at him from the photo-
graph he was equally certain that he
was now no longer doing so but if
this change had indeed taken place
it was utterly against natural law

 this thought gave him but little
comfort until he realized that he
could settle the question of whether
or not his imagination had been re-
miss by taking the negative and hav-
ing a separate print made for com-
parison at once he was flooded with
a strange feeling of freedom from
dread he felt that he was about to
do the right thing the possibility
that his confidence did not come en-
tirely from within himself did not
occur to him

 in the morning he took the nega-
tive and made a second print en-
larged to the same size as the orig-
inal he came to his desk with it
and stood it up below the framed
photograph

 what he saw was so far from re-
assuring that he caught hold of a
chair and eased himself into it not
only was the second print as he had
originally believed the framed photo-
graph to have been but the latter
had again changed in the night her-
cules teddifer had moved closer to
the figure in the bed and his hands
were clenched

 moncati began to perspire coldly
for a moment he sat there at a loss
to know what to do and he thought
confusedly of the old mans strange
beliefs somehow it had not before
occurred to him that by photograph-
ing the old man he had managed
however obscurely to himself to per-
petuate teddifer and his evil design
but in the height of his misery hope
came to him he came to his feet
and in two strides had torn the pho-
tograph from the wall

 three minutes later all that was
left was a small drift of ashes

 he was utterly relieved at once
how the old man could have man-

aged recourse to his magic sorcery
in this way was beyond moncati but
the knowledge that he had circum-
vented him a second time was not
his opinion of himself soared

  he went out to celebrate he made
a night of it hilariously told some
acquaintances that he was celebrating
his freedom and congratulated him-
self upon shaking off the dread he
had known so briefly again he came
in late after midnight his mind a
little sluggish and threw himself
partly dressed on to his bed where
he fell asleep at once

  not quite an hour later he awoke
the clock had struck two and he lay
drowsily staring into the darkness
for some minutes before he heard the
sound like the rattling and rustling
of paper even at that he did not
come fully awake he pondered the
sound sleepily and was not aware of
its approach until it was almost upon
his room

then he listened carefully won-
dering what it might be it was
like nothing he had ever heard be-
fore save for its dry rustling and
crackling

  he raised himself tiredly on one
elbow just as the door of his room
opened this distracted him momen-
tarily from the sound of movement
and he thought a draft had drawn it
open for at the moment there was
nothing but darkness flowing in upon
him

 not until an uncanny chill per-
vaded his senses did he realize that
the darkness he saw was not the
shadows in the hall but that it was
something alive something malig-
nant instantly he was caught in a
cloud of dread he saw the darkness
resolve itself into a dim human fig-
ure one side aglow as if a light were
falling upon it and heard a dry
chuckling all too familiar

 it was hercules teddifers grim
face that looked down upon him

 even as an outcry rose to mon-
catis lips the ungainly hands closed
around his neck

 the last thing moncati remem-
bered was the thing he had unfor-
tunately forgotten the second print

chapter i
the empty cube

i was with chatham when he
discovered the box and i can
still remember his cry of de-
light and surprise when he unearthed
it we had been doing a bit of fos-
sil hunting on a piece of land of his
in southeastern pennsylvania where
a spur of primal rock strata reared
its head practically to the surface
so far we had found little more
than the usual fossil shells and a few

the lantern was to be
extinguished as soon as
gunthorp was in
position

fern impressions so battered by time
that they were practically worthless
but this was different

 at his shout i left my own dig-
ging a little distance away and
joined him he was standing over
what looked like a pocket in the
solid rock formed by some freak
folding of the strata back in pre-
glacial times

 look wilder he exclaimed

it was hollow but not empty nothing


v-r-t

jubilantly i was trying to chip off
this upper layer when my pick went
straight through what do you make
of it

 i got down on my hands and knees
and peered into the opening he had
made i saw what he was raving
about

  the pocket extended a foot or two
in all directions beyond the opening
and about four feet downward and

resting flat upon its bottom was a
rectangular shaped object

 what the dickens i exclaimed
and began to pry away pieces of the
loose rock with my hands what is
it

 he got down beside me looks
as though it might be man-made
doesnt it nature doesnt work in
such perfect cubes

  i dont know i replied thought-

was in it but nothing was-something




strange stories

fully although the same idea had
flashed across my own mind there
are certain slate formations-

  but this isnt slate he inter-
rupted he picked up a shard of the
dull colored rock its igneous stuff
much older than slate

 but later than the surrounding
rock apparently i said i scram-
bled to my feet lets enlarge the
opening and see what youve found
a few blows of our picks cleared
away the top of the pocket giving
us an unobstructed view into the
cavity beneath it now measured
about four feet in all of its dimen-
sions with the two foot cube resting
upon the middle of its floor

 ill drop in and pass it out to
you chatham said then we can
examine it better

 think you can manage it alone
i asked it looks as though it were
made of solid metal

  ill try he answered letting him-
self down into the hole if i cant
well attach ropes

  he knelt in the confined space and
wrapped his arms about the cube
his muscles swelling beneath his
khaki shirt in anticipation of the
strain the next instant he had al-
most gone over backwards taking
the cube with him

his expression of stunned sur-
prise was so comical that i
laughed man you dont know your
own strength i told him here let
me take it

 he rose holding the cube easily
under one arm believe it or not
wilder he said the things hol-
low

 nonsense i scoffed taking it
from him while he climbed back be-
side me but immediately i realized
that he had spoken the truth no
solid could have been so weight-
less

  if its hollow it must be a box
of some sort i said and there
must be a way to open it

 but a careful examination first
with the naked eye and then with a
powerful lens revealed not the
slightest trace of latch key-hole or
hinge the six sides were as smooth

as though they had been cast in one
solid piece

  chatham was both excited and dis-
turbed he shook his head there
was the beginning of awe in his
eyes

  one things clear at least he
muttered its man-made but made
by what sort of man its too old
for the stone age even if they pos-
sessed a knowledge of metals in
those days which they didnt why
the rock this thing was embedded
in must go back to the pleistocene
period

  and that was just the beginning
of the age of mammals i said

  we looked at each other and i saw
the inward sense of strangeness re-
flected in his eyes and knew that
mine held the same reflection we
felt less elated even a little subdued
here was an object unquestionably
made by human hands yet found
embedded in rocks that had been
formed ages before man himself had
come into being

 chatham laughed nervously i
know what im going to do he said
with sudden determination im go-
ing to telegraph for old gunthorp
at the university hell be able to
explain it if anybody can i got
the odd impression that we were
like children a little frightened and
therefore appealing to a father for
aid and advice

  professor timothy gunthorp was
like ourselves an amateur archeolo-
gist but an exceptionally good one
his real work was in the physics
department at one of americas
largest universities where he was
working upon an experiment to con-
vert energy into matter thus reversing
the usual process

  we rode into town in my rattle-
trap car and sent off our wire at
once before sundown we had re-
ceived an answer

 youre mistaken there aint
no such animal will come on
tomorrow to see it

gunthorp

  we felt better we were clearing
away our breakfast things the next
morning when the familiar bald head
the box from the stars



and steel-rimmed spectacles of pro-
fessor gunthorp looked in at the
open door of our shack

  youre fools both of you he an-
nounced with his customary abrupt-
ness tearing a man away from im-
portant work with a cock-and-bull
story lets have a look at this im-
possible marvel of yours

  i went over to our work table and
removed the tarpaulin that we had
thrown over the box gunthorp
frowned disapprovingly

  so you couldnt leave it where it
was until i got here he observed
well you must have taken photo-
graphs of it in its original position
at least

  feeling like utter simpletons we
had to admit that in our excitement
we had overlooked that bit of rou-
tine

  gunthorp clucked his tongue in
annoyance and you blockheads
call yourselves archeologists he
snorted

  only rank amateurs professor
chatham said humbly

 gunthorp began to examine the
box first he lifted it to test its
weight then he rapped upon it with
his knuckles

  hollow as your two heads he
vouchsafed he bent closer and
studied the metal looks like tung-
sten he observed but it isnt
either of you got any idea what it
is

 we both confessed that we had
not

  well neither have i he ad-
mitted sourly now take me out
and show me where you found it

  we conducted him to the spot and
stood aside while he examined first
the hole itself and then the sur-
rounding rocks as his inspection
progressed there grew upon his
long lean face a look of bepuzzle-
ment that afforded both chatham
and me secret satisfaction pres-
ently he picked up a spade that we
had neglected to take in the night
before and with an energy surpris-
ing in a man of his years began to
clear away the rubble for about six
feet on all sides of the hole

  of a sudden he threw down the
spade and whirled upon us i never
before suspected either of you of
possessing a sense of humor he
barked at us but in any case your
so-called practical joke is rather
thin

  practical joke we gasped to-
gether we were both accustomed to
gunthorps peppery outbursts but
this did not sound like the usual
thing

  if theres a practical joke pro-
fessor its on us too i declared
we found the box in that pocket
yesterday precisely as we told you
in our wire if anybody put it there
for a little leg-pulling they did an
unusually clever job for the rock
stratum was closed above it

  i broke into it accidentally with
my pick chatham added

something in cur words or at-
titudes must have convinced him
for his manner underwent a subtle
change a queer unreadable expres-
sion crept into his eyes

  youve noticed i suppose that
this rock is not the same as the sur-
rounding rocks he queried

  we nodded a glacial boulder
from the riss or wurm- i began
but he interrupted me

  use your eyes wilder use your
eyes this is no glacial boulder from
the wurm the riss or any other
glacier look at its pitted surface
its a fallen meteor i

  i looked even with my limited
knowledge of meteorology i realized
all at once that he spoke the truth
the thought was dizzying millions
of years ago this huge blob of mat-
ter had been drawn into the earths
gravitational field and had become
embedded in the still soft rocks
probably it had originally been bu-
ried hundreds of feet deep and the
gradual weathering and wearing
down of the top strata through
countless millenia had only within
the past thousand or so years
brought it near the surface near
enough for our spades to strike

  chatham was staring at the gray
pitted mass that the professors


strange stories

spade had cleared but-but the
box he asked dazedly

  exactly gunthorp repeated
the box

  without another word the three
of us marched back to the shack for
a further examination of our myster-
ious find

  but we learned no more than we
already knew acid tests showed
that it was composed of an alloy of
tungsten and some other metal with
which we were unfamiliar a further
proof if we had needed any that it
was the work of intelligent beings
but that those beings could have
been inhabitants of this earth was
utterly impossible both because of
the tremendous age of the rocks in
which the box had been embedded
and its unquestionable encasement in
a meteor

wild thoughts flashed through
my mind imaginings based on
remembered legends of a race be-
fore the time of adam and of things
that had supposedly drifted down
from the stars but i did not men-
tion them to gunthorp he was
striving desperately to keep matters
on a rational prosaic plane besides
there was bound to be some less fan-
tastic explanation there had to be

  what id like to know chatham
remarked in the manner of one
thinking aloud is what the thing
was for why should it have been
made hollow

  gunthorp looked up why not
cut it open and find out he asked

  the suggestion seemed like a good
one and we agreed chatham brought
out the large plate camera and took
several pictures of the box from all
angles then i set to work upon it
with a cold chisel

 we got our second shock my
greatest efforts produced not a sin-
gle dent in the tough metal

  chatham and gunthorp tried their
hands but with no better success
between us we turned the edges on
four tools the box itself remained
practically unscratched

  chatham ran his fingers through
his red hair its a lot tougher than
ordinary tungsten he said-

  then he had an idea going over
to the supply cupboard he brought
back two phials one containing iron
oxide the other powdered aluminum

  if this doesnt do the trick well
get an oxyacetylene torch he said

 not bad gunthorp commented
in what was for him extravagant
praise of course theres a chance
of its marring the inside when it
burns through but well have to run
that risk

  he took the two vials from chat-
ham and blended their contents in a
thin careful line along the four
edges of the boxs topmost plane
then he lit it

  there was a sharp hiss as the pow-
ders ignited then it began to
burn with a brilliant greenish white
flame

  wordlessly we watched that hol-
low square of fire keeping well back
from the tremendous heat that it
generated slowly it began to sink
into the metal eating its way like
an acid in another minute or so it
would be through and the top of
the cube would drop inward

  gunthorp was standing by with a
pail of water which he meant to dash
over it at the crucial moment he
had even taken a step forward when
without an instants warning the un-
expected happened

  with a final sputter the burning
powder ate through the last thin
bit of metal but instead of falling
in the top of the box flew upward
there was a rush of escaping force
-the word does not describe it prop-
erly but it is the nearest i can find
-and we were hurled backwards
into unconsciousness

 we all regained our senses at
about the same time and stared at
one another in bewilderment

  what was it i muttered an
infernal machine

  but i knew better even as i spoke
had there been any kind of explo-
sion our frail shack would have
been in ruins whereas not even the
glass of the windows were broken

  gunthorp picked himself up and
went over to the work table

  whatever it was its left no trace
behind it he said jerkily he held
the box from the stars



up the cube still glowing redly
around its seared edges its interior
was as blank and uninformative as
its exterior had been

 it couldnt have been a gas of
any kind chatham supplemented
a gas powerful enough to knock us
all out would have left some after-
effects it was more like-like-
he groped inadequately for words

 like a great mental shock i
supplied trying to analyze my own
feelings at the time

 thats it gunthorp rasped
the thing that was in that box
paralyzed our minds temporarily
but its gone now he added with a
rueful shrug dissipated upon the
air and thats the end of it

 but for once professor timothy
gunthorp was wrong

       chapter ii
       missing men

two weeks drifted by gunthorp
had returned to his research
work at the university where in his
spare time he was writing a mono-
graph upon our mysterious discov-
ery and subsequent experience a
work which he told us frankly he
had little hope that anyone would
believe chatham and i had gone
back to our fossil hunting and al-
though we talked about the box
often we felt that there was nothing
more we could do about it

 then one day chatham who had
gone into town for supplies brought
back a strange story there was be-
tween our camp and the town a fair
sized woods that formed a veritable
paradise for rabbit hunters during
the game season since the season
had just opened the day before a
swarm of them had descended upon
it and that was where chathams
story came in

 it seemed that a party of local
men had started out early in the
morning and had separated after
reaching the woods according to

custom after hunting all day they
met again at a lodge that they kept
to spend the night and they dis-
covered that one of their number a
man named ed stanton was missing
they waited for him until ten
oclock then fearing that he might
have met with an accident they set
out in search of him

 they searched with lanterns for
half the night but found no trace of
the missing man finally someone
suggested that he might have gone
home instead of returning to the
lodge so they inquired there but
without result members of his fam-
ily and neighbors had then joined in
the search which had continued
throughout the night with the com-
ing of daylight stanton was still
missing

 looks bad i commented when
chatham had finished his recital
that woods is large enough so that
if he were badly hurt or killed he
could lie there for days before being
discovered

 i know it chatham said he
glanced toward the forbidding dens-
ity of the woods scome half mile
away what do you say we join
in the search

  i was willing and we set out to-
gether the going was slow it was
nearly noon when we encountered
three members of the original hunt-
ing party coming from the opposite
direction

 what luck i asked

  the oldest of the group shook his
head not any he replied weve
found plenty of fresh marks in the
bushes but with the gang that was
in here yesterday its impossible to
tell whether any of them are eds
it seems funny that he could have
disappeared this way but of course
weve got a good bit of territory
still to search

 what about his dog chatham
asked didnt he have a dog
thats another funny thing the
other answered the dogs gone
too

 however we found the dog or
rather another party did around
three oclock in the afternoon it
was lying under a clump of laurel


strange stories

bushes and it was dead with its
tail drawn down between its legs and
its eyes bulging but there was not
a single mark of violence upon its
body

  maybe it got hold of something
that poisoned it one fellow sug-
gested as a number of us gathered
round

  but the county sheriff who had
now taken charge of the search
shook his head it wasnt any poison
killed that dog he declared look
at his eyes and tail he was scared
to death plumb scared id swear
it and damn it im scared too

  we redoubled our searching ef-
forts we thrashed literally every
foot of the underbrush within a mile
radius of the place where we had
found the dog we found no trace
of stanton

  with the coming of night the
sheriff called us all together

  no use going on after dark he
told us these woods are too thick
and we couldnt do a thorough job
better to wait until daylight and
start in again

however a few searchers con-
tinued on their own and in the
morning one of them a farm laborer
named jake mills had a somewhat
weird story to relate he and a com-
panion had penetrated with a lantern
into the deepest part of the woods
when of a sudden they had become
aware of a strong sensation of being
followed

  we didnt hear nothin and we
didnt see nothin jake explained
it was just the way you feel when
somebodys behind you starin with
all his might at the back of your
head we turned around and sent
the light of the lantern as far as it
would go among the trees but there
was nothin there we even went
back apiece but we couldnt find
anything yet every time wed start
on wed have that feelin of some-
thin behind us but not as close as
it had been the first time finally
it got on our nerves and so we de-
cided wed better take the sheriffs
advice and wait till mornin

  it was this story of jakes that

gave rise to the belief that an es-
caped lunatic with homicidal ten-
dencies might be hiding in the
woods but a check-up of all the
local and even more distant institu-
tions for the insane revealed that all
their inmates were accounted for a
number of the men began to laugh
at what they called jakes case of
cold feet others remembered stan-
tons dog and werent so free with
their jibes

  nor were the others when four
days later a second man disappeared

  he was a dr philip morse mem-
ber of a boston society for physical
research he had arrived at the local
hotel shortly after stantons disap-
pearance and advanced the theory
that the missing man had fallen vic-
tim to some elemental or earth spirit
that had been released in the woods
there was considerable amusement
at his statement but when he
calmly announced his intention of
camping alone in the woods in an
attempt to contact the thing the
amusement faded

  its not that i hold with your
ghost stories dr morse the sheriff
told him but theres something in
them woods thats snatched ed stan-
ton away bodily and scared the life
out of his dog a man aint safe
there alone

  dr morse only smiled that eve-
ning he pitched a small tent near
the place where jake mills and his
companion had first felt they were
being followed

  early the next morning the sher-
iff and two other men went out to
check up on him what gruesome
horror they expected to discover
they themselves did not know but
they found the doctor calmly pre-
paring his breakfast after an un-
eventful night

  the fact that he had spent one
night alone in those supposedly sin-
ister woods without anything out of
the ordinary befalling him lulled
everyone into a false sense of secur-
ity hence the discovery that was
made the following day vas doubly
shocking

  a party of searchers coming upon
the camp around noon of the second
the box from the stars



day found it literally torn to pieces
as for dr morse himself he had
disappeared as completely as stanton
had done five days before

  chatham and i went to view the
wreckage as soon as we heard about
it we found a large crowd there
looking about

 looks like a cyclone hit the
place one man remarked as we
stopped beside him the doc must
have put up a fearful fight

  a cyclone or a lunatic another
amended one of them funny farms
must be holdin out on us

  but the tent was demolished the
camp furniture bedding and even
articles of clothing were torn to
pieces in a way that even the most
desperate struggle could not properly
account for

  the sheriff came over to us well
at least we know where morse was
when he was attacked he said ive
sent to philadelphia for bloodhounds
when they come im going to start
out from here and see what they can
find

 we complimented him upon the
plan he nodded then with a sig-
nificant glance and quick gesture im-
plied that he had something else to
discuss with us in private he mo-
tioned us aside

  i found this notebook under a
part of the tent he explained when
we had drawn a little away from the
others morse must have been writ-
ing in it just before the thing got
him i thought maybe you fellows
would take a look at it and tell me
whether theres anything in it except
just craziness

  i took the notebook from him and
flipped open the top cover several
pages were covered with a cramped
closely written shorthand almost un-
decipherable

  it will take a little while to figure
this out i said may i keep it
until tomorrow morning

  sure he agreed readily keep
it as long as you like just so you
find out what it says

  but i was destined not to trans-
late personally more than the open-
ing pages of that manuscript for
that evening the bloodhounds arrived

chapter iii
the cave

at the sheriffs invitation we
joined him and a party of about
a dozen others on the man-hunt
darkness had already fallen when we
assembled at the scene of dr morses
demolished camp in the flickering
yellow light of lanterns the shadows
of trees and bushes danced and
writhed in grotesque contortions
giving the scene an eeriness that un-
pleasantly affected all of us

  a little to one side a stranger
stood with the dogs two powerful
black fellows who lolled passively at
the ends of their chains as though
they had no interest in what was
going on presently the sheriff went
over and held a brief low-voiced con-
versation with their owner then he
addressed the rest of us

  mr pattons gonna let the dogs
go now he announced he says we
should stand back till theyve picked
up the scent then we can follow as
close as were able if they start up
any ruckus you fellas that have guns
aint to use them unless you can see
plain what youre shootin at youre
liable to hit the dogs or the doc

  the man called patton was hold-
ing part of a torn coat-evidently
morses-against the muzzle of first
one dog then the other when they
had sniffed their fill he slipped the
chains from their collars and with a
final indistinguishable command to
them stepped back

  noses pressed to the ground the
two animals began to run around the
wreckage of the tent in gradually
widening circles then with a kind
of nasal whine one of them suddenly
darted off at a tangent followed al-
most immediately by the other

  with a feeling of rising excite-
ment we started after them falling
into a rough single file to facilitate
travel we lost sight of the dogs
almost from the beginning but we
could hear them breaking through


strange stories

the underbrush a short distance ahead
of us while they gave voice almost
continuously to their deep-throated
baying

  for nearly a mile we pushed on
without anyone uttering a word the
silence around us broken only by the
crackle of twigs and the baying of
the dogs now farther distant then
of a sudden their baying gave place
to excited yelping interspersed with
high-pitched whining noises

  theyve found him the sheriff
exclaimed and broke into a run

know practically nothing about
bloodhounds but i had a pre-
monition the moment their tone
changed that everything was not go-
ing according to schedule no dog
regardless of his breed ever indulges
in that high-pitched whine when
everything is running entirely to his
satisfaction i glanced at patton and
saw the same suspicion reflected on
his face

  by this time we had come out
upon a deep gully whose opposite
wall was broken by the yawning black-
ness of a caves mouth the dogs had
already crossed this gulley and were
now yelping and whining in front of
the cave

  gosh almighty he must be in
there the sheriff exclaimed and
started scrambling down the steep
side of the ravine whod have
thought-

  equally puzzled the rest of us fol-
lowed we all knew about the cave
of course but no one had thought to
search it because it was known to be
the abode of bats and small but very
disagreeable snakes ed stanton
would never have gone in there alive
and he could not have got there dead
but dr morse now might be an-
other story-

  patton had forged on ahead of the
rest of us and was standing over the
dogs when we came up

  theyve got something cornered
in there but they wont go in after
it he announced ive never known
them to act like this before i dont
understand it

  the sheriff went over and held up
his lantern so that its light pene-

trated some ten or twelve feet into
the cave the dogs came straight
here without seemin to lose the
trail he commented so morse must
be inside shall we go in

  someone in the crowd offered an
objection maybe theres a wild ani-
mal in there if the dogs wont go
in-

  but patton scouted the suggestion
theres no animal in this part of
the country that these dogs are
afraid of he declared still ill
admit theres something strange about
the way theyre acting

  he made a final effort to induce
the dogs to lead the way into the
cave but without success they only
cowered upon their bellies and
whined gazing pleadingly at him
with their large intelligent eyes

  its no use he announced either
well have to go in without them
or we stay out

  the sheriff gave a hitch to his
belt and stepped almost casually into
the cave entrance all right he
drawled all them that wants come
along them that dont can wait
where they are

  there was a momentary hesitancy
on the part of a few individuals but
eventually everyone followed him
into the dark opening

  we advanced about fifty or sixty
feet without making any sort of dis-
covery a few bats disturbed by the
glare of our lanterns darted blindly
about our heads but that was all
then suddenly the sheriff stopped

  look he commanded and pointed
downward

  there in the thin sticky mould
that covered the damp rock of the
floor was a human footprint

  instantly an excited babbling of
speculation broke out among us it
was quite obvious that the footprint
had been made within the past
twenty-four hours since as yet none
of the microscopic green algae plants
had begun to form within it there-
fore it had almost certainly been
made by dr morse

  further searching revealed more
footprints in fact two sets of them
the one superimposed upon the other
from the presence of the algae in
the box from the stars



the earlier set it was plain that it
had been made at least several days
before the second

  it looks as if morse and stanton
might both have come this way i
whispered to chatham as we began
to move forward again

  he nodded in the ruddy glow of
the lanterns his face appeared wor-
ried thats what i dont like about
it wilder he replied what could
have brought both of those men to
this same cave and why did neither
of them come out

  it almost seems as if- a sudden
startled shout from one of the men
up ahead interrupted me

  look he was crying pointing a
trembling arm as he spoke look
over there on that ledge

  we all looked in the direction he
indicated where a ledge of rock ex-
cept for a narrow crevice some two
feet wide opening into unexploited
blackness formed the back of the
cave perched facing us upon this
ledge and seeming to stare at us
with unblinking lusterless eyes were
two human figures

  the sheriff took a quick step for-
ward then almost dropped his lan-
tern merciful god he gasped
its ed stanton and doctor morse
so it was the faces of the two
men bore no marks of physical
change or disfigurement yet in some
subtle way they had altered so that
at first glance we had been unable to
recognize them

  a  number of the men went oyer
and lifted them down both bodies
were limp and clammy but to our
surprise they were not dead

  get them out of here and into the
open the sheriff ordered maybe
we can bring them around

  four men took up the inert bur-
dens and we started back the way
we had come two of the younger
fellows however lingered behind the
others

  i wonder where that crack leads
to i heard one of them mutter to
the other id like-

  but i was too interested in the
condition of morse and stanton to
pay any further attention i was to
wish later that i had

 the two bodies were placed upon
the ground at the entrance to the
cave and the local doctor who for-
tunately was one of the party bent
over them

  i cant make it out he reported
after a brief examination it looks
like catalepsy except that theres
no rigidity wed better get them to
a hospital at once

  while crude stretchers were being
improvised from coats chatham drew
me aside

 wilder did you ever see a cre-
tin he asked lowering his voice so
that none of the others might over-
hear

 no i answered wondering why
he should bring up such a subject at
this time i cant say that i have
why

 well i have he went on and
except for the physical deformation
that accompanies cretinism the faces
have the same blank mindless look
that these two have

 but what- i never finished my
question from the interior of the
cave arose a sudden wild shriek of
terror followed by a hideous mouth-
ing and gibbering that was distinctly
not human

 i remembered the two men who
had lingered behind

snatching a lantern i dashed
for the mouth of the cave fol-
lowed closely by chatham and one or
two others

  it took me almost no time at all to
reach the place where we had found
morse and stanton but in those few
minutes the sounds that had sum-
moned us had subsided into a low
jabbering like the chattering of a
monkey and they were coming from
beyond the crevice at the back of the
cave

 holding the lantern high above
my head i started toward the narrow
opening but before i could reach it
a man staggered out and all but col-
lapsed in my arms he was jim
lentz one of the two who had re-
mained behind

  something-in there he muttered
thickly got heilman-no use   
going in    too late  
eo

strange stories

  then he fainted

  i do not lay any claims to bravery
for actually pressing on into that
dark passageway it was the sheer
excitement of the moment that drove
me leaving no room for fear still
holding the lantern in front of me i
sidled along the crevice for about six
feet abruptly i found myself in
another cave

  it was much smaller than the first
so that the light of the lantern pene-
trated into practically all of it at
once as the ruddy rays sent the
black shadows scuttling back among
the uneven prominences and fissures
that marked the walls and ceiling i
experienced a curious sensation which
i am wholly unable to describe al-
though i realize how ridiculous the
words may sound i can say only
that it was as though some over-
powering force had collided with my
mind

  the impression was only momen-
tary and was gone with the retreat-
ing shadows but instantly a second
shock-this time wholly explicable-
took its place for groveling upon
the middle of the rock floor and
mouthing horribly like some mad
animal was the figure of heilman

  i heard an exclamation behind me
and realized that chatham had fol-
lowed me through the narrow pass-
age

  merciful god he choked hes
gone mad

  quick i ground between clenched
teeth we must get him out of here

  i set the lantern upon a projecting
rock and chatham and i flung our-
selves upon heilman he had paid
no attention to us until he felt our
hands upon him then he began to
fight with the strength of a maniac
in the end we were forced to knock
him unconscious before we were able
to drag him from the cave

  when he came to he was-f still in
that savage bestial state he had to
be taken to an asylum

ttext day we heard lentzs story
of what had taken place i set
it down here as nearly as i can in his
own words

  we were about to leave the cave

with the rest of you he told a
group of us when heilman sug-
gested that we stay and see where
that little opening at the back led to
i wasnt so keen about it but when
he laughed and said i was afraid i
gave in

 he had the lantern and so he
went first while i followed close be-
hind the passage was so narrow
that we had to go sideways and the
first thing i knew my coat had caught
on a sharp rock so that i had to stop to
get it loose heilman must have
thought that i wasnt coming for he
made a grab for me as he did that
he somehow dropped the lantern and
it went out

  he paused and passed a trembling
hand over his face it was plain that
what he had to relate filled him with
almost unendurable horror

  its hard to explain what happened
next he went on after a minute
for i dont exactly know myself
all of a sudden he let go of me and
staggered backwards then he let
out the most awful yell ive ever
heard

  at first i thought hed fallen into
a pit or something and i called out
to him to ask what was wrong he
didnt answer me with words but he
began to make those awful noises
like-like an animal or something
there were sounds of thrashing
about too but they werent so much
like two men or even a man and an
animal struggling together as like
one man fighting with himself

  i tried to go to help him but all
of a sudden i-i couldnt move it
was as if everything id ever been
afraid of without giving a name to
it had taken form in there if any
of you fellows were ever scared of
the dark when you were kids youll
know what i mean it was like that
only a hundred times worse and all
the time heilman kept making those
terrible noises not so loud as at first
but more and more like an animal

 then i heard somebody coming
and i-i managed to get out to them
i guess thats all i know

  that afternoon the sheriff and sev-
eral others searched both parts of
the cave with powerful electric
the box from the stars



 torches they found absolutely noth-
 ing but the sheriff in telling us
 about it afterwards concluded with
 a strange statement

   i was the last one to leave the
 inner cave he said and just as i
 stepped into that narrow passage
 that connects the two a funny thing
 happened all of a sudden i had the
 same feeling that jake mills had had
 in the woods the night after ed
 stanton disappeared the feeling of
 something staring at the back of my
 head it fairly made the chills go
  over me for i knew there wasnt a
 living thing back there ive a notion
 to ask the county commissioners either
 to have that place sealed up or
 better yet dynamited

chapter iv

the gunthorp theory

ith the finding of stanton
 and dr morse and the insan-
 ity of heilman the newspapers
 which had hitherto given the disap-
 pearances only passing notice now
 broke out with headlines naturally
 this resulted in an army of curiosity
 seekers who had to be kept away
 from the cave by an armed guard
 but it was also indirectly responsible
 for bringing about the solution to
 the whole mysterious affair for it
 brought back prof gunthorp

   he presented himself unannounced
 at our shack sarcastic and snappy as
 ever

   well i see youve done nothing
 toward clearing this mess up he an-
 nounced abruptly so i came my-
 self

   chatham made some ill-advised re-
 mark about not seeing how the hap-
 penings at the cave could come under
 the province of archeology the pro-
 fessor shot him a withering glance

  you wouldnt he snapped i
 suppose you and wilder are ready to
 subscribe to morses ghost theory
 still he added as if on second
 thought that man may have been

nearer to the right track than he
realized a shame he didnt make
any sort of notes before the thing
got him

 but he did i exclaimed sud-
denly remembering the notebook that
i had promised the sheriff to trans-
late here they are

  he fairly pounced upon the little
book you blithering idiots he
cried if you had examined this
that last poor devil heilman might
not have been sacrificed now get
out while i see what morse had to
say

 all the rest of that morning he
was occupied with laboriously trans-
cribing dr morses cramped short-
hand by the middle of the after-
noon he had completed the task and
was ready to share what he had
learned with chatham and me

 well skip over the first few
pages he announced since they
consist of nothing but morses idiotic
theories funny how an otherwise
sane man will cling to worn out
superstitions when he can find a
wholly satisfactory explanation of
the facts in the laws of higher phys-
ics but let that go you probably
wouldnt understand it anyway

  he leafed jerkily over one or two
more pages this next is an hourly
record of his first nights vigil he
continued and consists mainly of
the words nothing so far so we
can skip that too but here is his
record of the second night up to the
point where he was attacked

  he cleared his throat and began to
read aloud

   eight p m it is fairly dark now
so i will begin my record for to-
night although i really cannot hope
for any genuine phenomenon for
some hours yet still for the sake of
science it is best to be on the safe
side the woods are very still but
no more so than they should be ordi-
narily again i shall endeavor to work
without light since light of any kind
seems to be antagonistic to psychic
forces

  nine p m nothing yet the
trees and bushes on all sides are
loud with the voices of night insects
it seems almost impossible that such


strange stories

tiny creatures can make so much
noise i am beginning to believe
that the true intensity of sound is to
be measured only by the intensity of
the silence that surrounds it

   ten p m either some of the
insects have gone to sleep or i am
growing accustomed to their minia-
ture racket i probably did not notice
this last night because i was still too
new at this type of vigil

  ten-thirty i am making this
entry a half hour earlier because i
believe that soon i will have some
sort of success the insects are
nearly all quiet now a circumstance
which i am positive did not occur
last night but it is not merely this
cessation of ordinary night noises
that leads me to believe i am about
to experience some kind of psychic
phenomenon there is a decided feel-
ing of tension in the air such as is
noticeable just prior to a severe elec-
trical storm yet the sky wherever
it is visible through the trees is en-
tirely cloudless and my little barom-
eter which i examined a moment
ago with my flashlight shows no in-
dication of falling weather

  ten forty-five i was right a
force of some sort is gathering out-
side my tent as the man mills
described i can feel eyes upon me
but they are not human eyes i will
make my mind receptive to whatever
may be coming

   eleven p m it is here in the
tent with me and i must fight it off
my god it is horrible i can neither
see it nor hear it and yet it has
taken hold of me if the cold arm of
an octopus could reach into my mind
it would be like that it is too strong
for me i- 

  gunthorp looked up from the note-
book the writing breaks off here
in a meaningless scrawl he said
the power must have overcome
him

chatham and i had been listen-
ing open-mouthed but what
power i asked incredulously if it
was something he could neither see
nor hear-nor apparently even feel
tangibly-what was it

  gunthorp shot me an enigmatic

glance through his thick-lensed spec-
tacles hasnt it dawned upon you
-even now he asked

  but chatham was leaning forward
his red hair bristling with excite-
ment professor he exclaimed
that day we opened the box-the
feeling of mental shock

  exactly the professors bald
head nodded the box

  he paused to enjoy the little dra-
matic moment he had created then
he went on

  it was a theory of the early phys-
icists and pseudo-physicsts-paracel-
sus in particular-that atoms were of
two classes the heavier and inert
composing matter the lighter and
more active composing mind

  of course such an idea went into
the discard even before the subdivi-
sions of the atom were discovered
but it is my belief that paracelsus
came nearer to the truth than even
he realized

  if as millikan suggests all mat-
ter i merely a form of energy-and
my own experiments tend to bear
this out-then it is quite possible
that the thing which we call mind or
mental force is a form of this energy

  whether the process of thought
is its ordered releasing through the
material chemistry of the brain or
whether it is an independent quantity
that acts through the brain need not
concern us now the important point
is that such a quantity should be
able to exist in the free state the
same as any other of the known ele-
ments

  if i am right then some sort of
entity made up of this pure energy
was imprisoned in the box which you
found embedded in the meteor dont
ask me how or by whom for those
are questions beyond our power to
answer but when the box was
opened this force was released to go
about preying upon other mental
forces just as we feed our material
bodies with other material bodies
do you follow me

  we did after a fashion although
the idea behind his words seemed al-
most too fantastic for credence

  chatham was running his fingers
through his hair as if to aid in as-
the box from the stars



similating the professors startling
statement

  but it isnt logical he finally
burst out if the thing feeds upon
mental power how did it manage to
keep alive during all those hundreds
of thousands of years that it was im-
prisoned in the box

  perhaps feeds is an ill-chosen
word gunthorp admitted the en-
tity - if we can call it such - could
exist indefinitely without nourish-
ment because it is composed of pure
force and force is indestructible it
may be more accurate to liken it to a
large blob of mercury which when
liberated will draw smaller globules
into itself

  we considered this in silence
then

  but if this thing remains at large
it will go about attacking others as
it attacked stanton and morse and
later heilman i exclaimed in hor-
ror why if it isnt stopped it isnt
beyond the bounds of possibility that
it will eventually absorb into itself
all the mental power of the world
is there no way to stop it or destroy
it

  destroy it no gunthorp an-
swered gravely however it is pos-
sible that we may be able to trans-
mute it so that it will be rendered
harmless and that is what we must
try to do

  it has long been a tenet of phys-
ics that force or energy is produced
by the destruction of matter in
other words matter which is made
up of minute particles may be
changed into energy which is of
wave composition but recent experi-
ment with light for example have
shown that it possesses the character-
istics of both particles and waves
this leads to the conclusion that the
two are but different forms of the
same thing and therefore inter-
changeable

  but what has all that to do-
chatham began but the professor
cut him short

  think the old mans raving again
do you he snapped well hes
not what im getting at if you had
the brains to see it is that its as
logical to convert energy into matter

as it is to convert matter into en-
ergy

  your energy transformer i ex-
claimed remembering his work at
the university and suddenly seeing
the light

  exactly he replied of course i
cant guarantee that the thing will
work satisfactorily since its still
largely in the experimental stage
but at least we can try if it
fails-

  he shrugged well we will have
to think of something else

chapter v
the reversal of nature

that evening gunthorp sent off
a long wire to his assistant or-
dering the shipment of several pieces
of apparatus from his laboratory

  two days later the equipment ar-
rived a whole truck-load of it gun-
thorp did not unpack it but directed
his assistant who had brought it per-
sonally to drive it down to the
mouth of the cave

  well have to carry it piece by
piece into the outer cave and set it
up there he announced id prefer
to have it in the inner cave but it
would be impossible to get it through
that narrow passage the best we
can do is coax the entity out to us

  but how i asked practically

  you leave that to me was his
only answer

  it took us the better part of a
week to set the machinery up to his
satisfaction during all of our opera-
tions we kept the cave brightly
lighted with a number of kerosene
lamps for as gunthorp pointed out
the thing we were fighting struck
only in darkness indicating that
there was some property in light
that drove it off but even with the
protection of the lamps it was eerie
enough working in that ghostly bat-
hung cavern knowing that just be-
yond the narrow passage in the inner
chamber something lurked in wait


strange stories

something that fed upon mens
minds   

  i will not attempt to describe the
energy transformer other than to say
that it bore a rough resemblance to
those elaborate mechanisms used in
experiments to smash the atom but
built on a much smaller scale it
worked gunthorp explained by
changing the lengthwise undulation
of energy waves to sidewise or cross
vibration which would bring about
the transformation of pure energy
into free atoms

 when at last everything was in
readiness gunthorp gave chatham
and me our final instructions

 i want you both to listen care-
fully and to do exactly as i tell
you he began his usual fussy
bumptiousness was gone now and he
seemed unnaturally grave when
we go into the cave we will extin-
guish all the lanterns otherwise the
thing will not come out where we
are then you wilder will start the
generator while i go to the entrance
of the narrow passage that leads to
the inner cave

  but professor i broke in do
you realize what that means youll
be placing yourself in the position of
a human decoy to that monstrosity
yes yes i know he snapped
with a momentary return of his old
irritability but the thing must be
lured out somehow and thats the
only way i can think of however
there will be little danger if chat-
ham does precisely what i tell him
what do you want me to do
chatham asked a little uneasily

 i want you to stand by the pro-
jector gunthorp explained as
soon as you hear me utter a sound-
either an intelligible word or other-
wise-you will release the trans-
former beam leave it on for five
minutes if at the end of that time i
have not returned to shut it off you
must both get out of the cave as fast
as you can

 and leave you there chatham
exclaimed not if-

  be quiet you young idiot gun-
thorp interrupted testily youll do
as i tell you i know what im
about

  his tone precluded further argu-
ment we followed him obediently
into the cave

  one after another the lanterns
were extinguished until only one re-
mained chatham held it until gun-
thorp had taken up his position at
the entrance to the passage then it
too was put out

  for what seemed an eternity we
stood there in the darkness waiting
somewhere in that darkness we
knew a malignant entity lurked
something that fed upon mens minds
and cast aside their bodies like dis-
carded husks to my over-excited
imagination it seemed that this in-
visible horror was creeping up on me
from all sides at once and i felt
myself shrinking as if from a physi-
cal contact

  abruptly gunthorps voice came to
us out of the blackness

  now he hissed release the
ray

  with a feeling of relief that the
suspense of waiting was over and
definite action about to begin i
heard chatham throw the switch
the next instant-

how shall i ever describe what
followed there was no flash
for the condenser ray was invisible
nor was there any sound other than
the steady hum of the generator but
suddenly the air around us became
charged with the straining tension of
a mighty struggle a force that was
intelligent but not tangible had been
caught in the grip of a man-made
force against which it was now fight-
ing for its life

  for nearly four minutes by the
radium dial of my wrist watch the
battle raged seeming all the more
terrible because it was not physical
the air seemed to boil and swell
like water churned up by the thrash-
ing of a sea-serpent in its death
agony

  and then at last when it seemed
that we ourselves must be crushed by
the mighty force of the conflict
something snapped of a sudden the
tension was dissipated while the re-
lieved atmosphere appeared to col-
lapse like the sides of a balloon from
the box from the stars



which the straining gases have been
released the struggle was over

  someone was groping toward the
projector it was gunthorp i recog-
nized his voice as he stumbled over
some piece of apparatus in the dark-
ness

  professor are you all right i
called anxiously

  of course im all right came his
tart reply cant one of you idiots
make a light before i break my
neck

  here let me chatham offered he
struck a match

  there was a burst of flame accom-
panied by a terrific explosion the
walls of the cave rocked around us
and rocks and dirt were rained down
upon us one large sized rock struck
me upon the head-

  when i regained consciousness i
was lying upon my bunk back in
chathams and my shack gunthorp
was bending over me for the first
time since i had known him i sur-
prised an expression almost of ten-
derness in his eyes

  are you all right boy he asked
how do you feel

  oh i guess ill live i grinned
trying to ignore the pain in my head
tell me what happened

  it was all my fault chatham put
in that match i struck-

  it was my fault for being an old
fool gunthorp cut him short i
should have known better than to
have used the converter without test-
ing its strength first

  you see he explained the ray
was much stronger than i had antic-
pated thus instead of converting
the energy entity into free electrons
it condensed it into hydrogen atoms
the lowest step in the atomic scale
then when at my direction chat-
ham struck a match- he made an
expressive gesture

  the highly inflammable nature of
hydrogen did the rest chatham fin-
ished it took the roof off the cave
just above where you were standing
and dropped a piece of it down on
your head

  with a start i sat up unmindful
of the dizzying throbbing in my
head good lord i cried in alarm
if the thing was converted into hy-
drogen and the hydrogen exploded
then it was turned back into energy

         j

again

  i know gunthorp nodded but
this time it was scattered by the
force of the explosion and can do
no damage or at least he added
grimly so i hope

  and so far it seems that he is
right it is more than probable that
the entity torn apart by the explo-
sion was rendered utterly powerless
or if it was not it apparently prof-
ited by its bitter experiences in the
world of men and fled back to the
distant stars from which it came orig-
inally

  but that is something i suppose
we shall never know god keep us
from such things we need more
mind in the world not less

dead woman

by dr david h keller

author of the thing in the cellarthe human termites etc

he was found in the room
with his wife slightly con-
fused a trifle bewildered
but otherwise apparently normal he
made no effort to conceal his con-
duct any more than he did to the knife
in his hand or the pieces in the
trunk

  fortunately the inspector was an
officer of more than usual intelli-
gence and there was no effort made
to give the third degree or even se-

cure a written confession perhaps
the police department felt it was
too plain a case at least it was
handled intelligently and in a most
scientific manner the man was well
fed carefully bedded and the next
morning after being bathed and
shaved was taken to see a psychi-
atrist

  the specialist in mental diseases
had the man comfortably seated
knowing he smoked he offered a

eerie and flesh-cravling revelations form this shocking
kaleidoscope of a mind crying not guilty

that night the ies were worse than usuat
the dead woman

t

cigar which was accepted then in
a quiet pleasant atmosphere he made
one statement and one request

 i am sure mr thompson that
you had an excellent reason for act-
ing as you did the other day i wish
you would tell me all about it

the man gazed at the psychiatrist
will you believe me if i tell

you

  i will accept every part of your
story with the idea that you are con-
vinced that you are telling me the
truth

 that is all i want whispered
thompson if everyone i talked to
in the past had done that if they
had even tried to check up on my
story perhaps this would not have
happened but they always thought
that i was the sick one and there
was not one who was willing to ac-
cept my statement about the worms

  i suppose that i was happily mar-
ried at least as much so as most
men are you know that there is a
good deal of conflict between the
sexes and there were a few differ-
ences of opinion between mrs
thompson and myself but not
enough to cause serious difficulty
will you remember that that we
did not quarrel very much

  about a year ago my wifes health
began to give me considerable cause
for worry she started to fail if you
are a married man doctor you know
there is always that anxiety about
the wifes health you become ac-
customed to living with a woman
having her do things for you go to
places with you and you think about
how life would be if she should
sicken and die perhaps the fact that
you are uneasy about the future
makes you exaggerate the importance
of her symptoms

  at any rate she became sick de-
veloped a nasty cough and lost
weight i spoke to her about it and
even bought a bottle of beef wine
and iron at the drug store and made
her take it she did so to please me
but she never would admit that she
was sick said it was fashionable to
be thin and that the cough was just
nervousness

  she would not go to see a doctor
when i spoke to her mother about
it the old lady just laughed at me
said that if i tried to make lizzie a
little happier she would soon get fat
in fact none of our family or our
friends seemed to feel that there was
anything wrong with mrs thomp-
son so i stopped talking about it

  of course it was not easy on me
the way she coughed at night and
her staying awake so much i work
hard in the daytime and it is hard to
lose a lot of sleep at last i was
forced to ask her to let me sleep in
the spare bedroom

  even that did not help much i
could hear her cough and when she
did fall asleep i would have to tip-
toe into her room and see if she was
all right her coughing bothered me
so much that when she did not cough
it worried me more because i thought
something had happened to her

  one night the thing i was afraid
of happened she had a hard spell of
coughing and then she stopped it
was quiet in the house i could hear
the clock on the landing tick and a
mouse gnawing wood in the attic i
thought i could even hear my own
heart beat but there was not a sound
of any kind from the other bedroom

  when i went in there and turned
on the light i just knew it was all
over of course i was not sure a
bookkeeper is not supposed to be an
expert in such matters so i went
and telephoned for our doctor on
the way to the phone i wondered
just what i should say for he had
always insisted that my wife was in
grand health so i simply told him
that mrs thompson was not looking
well and would he come over just
like that i told him and tried to
keep my voice steady

  it was about an hour before he
came he went into the bedroom but
i stopped at the doorway he spent
sometime listening to her heart and
feeling her pulse and then he
straightened up and said to me

  she is fine just fast asleep i
wish i could sleep as soundly as that
what did you think was wrong

  that surprised me so much that
all i could do was to stammer some-


strange stories

thing about not hearing her cough
any more he laughed

   you worry too much about her
mr thompson

  right there my difficulty started
here was a doctor who was supposed
to know his business and he said
there was nothing wrong with my
wife and there i was just a book-
keeper and i just knew what was
the matter what was i to do tell
him that he was wrong send for
another physician

  it was growing light by that time
so i went down to the kitchen and
started the coffee i often did that
then i shaved and made ready to go
to the office but before i went i
sat down a while by the wifes bed
it bothered me but i had to keep
telling myself that the doctor knew
better than i did

eenefobt leaving the house i

  -h phoned to my mother-in-law
just told her that lizzie was not feel-
ing well and would she come over and
spend the day and she could get me
at the office any time she called
then i left the house it felt better
out in the sunshine and after work-
ing a few hours over the books i al-
most laughed at myself for being so
foolish

  no telephone calls from the old
lady i arrived home at six and found
the house lighted as usual my wife
and mother-in-law were waiting for
me in the parlor and told me supper
was ready naturally i was surprised
to see my wife out of bed

  at the supper table i watched her
just as carefully as i could without
making the two of them suspicious
of me mrs thompson ate about as
she usually did just pieced and
minced at her food but i thought
when she swallowed that the food
went down with a jerk and there
was a stiffness when she moved

  but her mother did not seem to
think there was anything wrong at
least she did not make any comment
even when i went with her to the
front door to say good night to her
and we were alone there she never
said a word to show that she thought
her daughter was peculiar

  i started to wash the dishes after
that i often washed the dishes at
night while the wife sat in the front
parlor watching the people go up
and down past the house after the
kitchen was tidy i lit a cigar and
went into the parlor and started a
little conversation but mrs thomp-
son never talked back in fact i do
not believe she ever talked to me
after that though i am positive that
she talked to the others

  when the cigar was smoked i
just said good night and went to bed
later i could hear her moving around
in her room and then all was quiet
so she must have gone to bed she
did not cough any more i congrat-
ulated myself on that one thing be-
cause the coughing had kept me
awake a good deal

  during the night i lit a candle
and shading it with my hand tip-
toed in to see her she had her eyes
open but they were rolled back so
all you could see was the whites and
she was not breathing at least i
could not tell that she was breath-
ing and when i held a mirror in
front of her mouth there was no
vapor on it my mother had told me
the purpose of that when i was a
boy

  the next day was just the same
my mother-in-law came and spent the
day i came home at night and ate
supper with them and washed the
dishes the water was hot and it
was a pleasure to make them clean
perhaps i took longer than usual at
it because i did not fancy the idea
of going into the front parlor where
the wife was sitting looking out of
the window

  but i went in tonight without
the usual cigar i wanted to use my
nose it seemed there was a peculiar
odor in the house like flowers that
had been put in a vase of water and
then forgotten for many days per-
haps you know the odor doctor a
heavy one like lilies of the valley in
a small closed room it was specially
strong in the parlor where mrs
thompson was sitting and it seemed
to come from her i had to light the
cigar after a while and by and by i
said good night and went to bed she
the dead woman



never spoke to me in fact she did
not seem to pay any attention to me

 about two that morning i took
the candle and went in to look at
her her eyelids were open and her
eyeballs were rolled back just like
they had been the night before but
now her jaw was dropped and her
cheeks sunk in i just could not do
anything but telephone for a doctor
and this time i picked out a total
stranger just pickcd his name out of
the telephone book haphazard

 what good did it do none at
all he came he examined mrs
thompson very carefully and he
simply said that he did not see any-
thing wrong with her and then down
in the front hall he turned on me
and asked me just why i had sent
for him and what i thought was the
matter with her of course i just
could not tell him the truth with
his being a doctor and i being just a
bookkeeper

          mother-in-law went to the
mountains next day for the
summer and that left us alone break-
fast as usual and to the office and
not a word all day from the house
when i came back at night the
house was lit and supper was on the
table and the wife at her end as usual
and the food served and on the
plates she ate but her movements
were slower and when she swallowed
you could see the food go down by
jerks and her eyes were sunken into
the sockets and seemed shiny and-
well like the eyes of a fish on the
stalls

  there were flowers on the table
but the smell was something differ-
ent it was sweeter and when i took
a deep breath it was just hard for me
to go on eating the pork chops and
potatoes you see it was summer
time and warm and in spite of the
screens there was a fly or two in the
house and when i saw one walking
around on her lip and she not mak-
ing any effort to brush it off i just
couldnt keep on eating had to go
and start washing the dishes per-
haps you can understand how i felt
doctor things looked rather odd

 the next day i phoned to the

office that i would not be there and
i sent for a taxi and took mrs
thompson to a first class specialist
he must have been good bccause he
charged me twenty-five dollars just
for the office call i went in first and
told him just exactly what i was
afraid of and i did not mince my
words and then we had the wife in

  he examined her even her blood
and all the satisfaction i got was
that she seemed a trifle anaemic but
that i had better take a nerve tonic
and a vacation or i would be sick

  things looked rather twisted after
that either i was right and every-
body else wrong or they were right
and i was just about as wrong men-
tally as a man could be but i had
to believe my senses a man just has
to believe what he sees and hears and
feels and when i thought over that
office visit and the wife smiling and
the doctor sticking her finger for the
blood to examine it just seemed im-
possible anaemic why-that was
a simple word to describe her con-
dition

  that night the flies were worse
than usual i went to the corner
store and bought a fly spray and
used it in her bedroom but they kept
coming in the big blue ones you
know seemed as though they just
had to come in and i could not keep
them off her face so at last in des-
peration i covered her head up with
a towel and went to sleep i had to
work the interest on the mortgage
was due and the man wanted some-
thing on the principal and it was a
good house and all i had in the
world to show for twenty years of
hard work keeping books

  the next day was just like all the
days had been except that i made
more mistakes with the books and
my boss spoke to me about it and
when i arrived home supper was not
ready though mrs thompson was in
the parlor and the lights on the
heavy odor was worse than usual and
there were a lot of flies you could
hear them buzz and strike against
the electric lights i got my own
supper but i couldnt eat much
thinking of her in the parlor and the
flies settling on her open mouth


strange stories

  she just sat there that night in
the parlor till i went to her and took
her arm to lead her up the stairs
she was cold and on each cheek
there was a heavy purple blotch
forming once she was in her room
she seemed to move around so i left
her alone and when i went into her
room later on she was in bed

  it had been a hard week for me
so i sat down by her bed and tried
to think but the more i thought the
worse things seemed the night was
hot and the flies kept buzzing just
thinking of the past and how we
used to go to the movies together and
laugh and sometimes come near cry-
ing and how we used to bluff about
the fact that perhaps it was just as well
we didnt have a child so long as we
had each other knowing all the time
that she was eating her heart out for
longing to be a mother and blaming
me for her loneliness

 the thinking was too much for
me so i thought i might as well
smoke another cigar and go to bed
and try to keep better books the next
day and hold my job-and then i
saw the little worm crawl out

  right then and there i knew that
something had to be done it didnt
make any difference what the doctors
or her mother said something had to
be done and i was the one who had
to do it

  i telephoned for an undertaker

  met him downstairs

   it will be a private funeral i
told him and no publicity and i
think after you are through you will
have no trouble obtaining a physi-
cians certificate

  he went up stairs in about five
minutes he came down stairs

   i must have gone to the wrong
room he said

   the second story front bedroom
i replied

 but the woman there is not
dead he said

 i paid him for his trouble and
shut the door in his face was i
helpless doctor you have to be-
lieve me i was at the end of my
rope i had tried every way i knew
and there was not anything left to
do no one believed me no one

agreed with me it seemed more and
more as though they thought i was
insane

t was impossible to keep her
-m in the house longer my health
was giving way working all day at
figures that were going wrong all the
time and coming back night after
night cooking my supper and sleep-
ing in a room next to the thing that
had been my wife what with the
smell of lilies of the valley and the
buzz of flies and the constant dread
in my mind of how things would be
the next day and the next week and
the mortgage due i had to do some-
thing

 and it seemed to me that she
wanted me to it seemed that she
recognized that things were not
right that she was entitled to a dif-
ferent kind of an ending i tried to
put myself in her place and i knew
what i would want done with me if
things were reversed

  so i brought the trunk up from
the cellar we had used that trunk
on our wedding trip and every sum-
mer since on our vacations and i
thought that she would be more at
peace in that trunk than in a new
one but when i had the trunk by
her bed i saw at once that it was
too small unless i used a knife

 that seemed to be the proper
thing to do and i was sure that it
would not hurt her for days she
had been past hurting i told her i
was sorry but it just had to be done
and if people had just believed me
things could have been arranged in a
nicer way then i started

  things were confused after that

  i seem to remember a scream and
blood spurting and the next thing
there were a lot of people in the
house and they arrested me

  and that is the peculiar part of
it all doctor perhaps you do not
know it but i am accused of murder-
ing my wife now i have told you
all about it doctor and i just want
to ask you one question if you had
been in my place day after day and
night after night what would you
have done doctor what would any
man have done who loved his wife

do you see them running running-

                        when margaret levering
                        left me in london she
                        said there is something
                        that cant wait out there peter

                                     i knew that whatever she implied
                                     had to do with her father then four
                                     months dead but margaret would
                                     tell me nothing more she went on
                                     to cairo alone as she wished but
                                     when six weeks paased with only
                                     the brief and strained notes from
                                     her i knew something was wrong
                                     and followed her

                                      at the hotel continental in cairo
                                      late one afternoon in october i had
                                      barely finished bathing when a boy
                                      appeared with a sealed note for me
                                      although i had informed no one of
                                      my arrival i ripped it open and
                                      read

dear mr harris

                                         i understand you have just come from
                                         london and i assume you are led here by
                                         your interest in the welfare of margaret

strange stories

is in cairo at the hotel memphis and who
has more than once spoken of you please
be so good as not to refer in any way to
her father the late lord warrender nor
to his recent excavations and unfortunate
death in the valley of the moon

  i should be glad to talk this unusual
request over with you as between mutual
friends of lady warrender if you should
so desire may i respectfully urge you to
see me before you see lady warrender
you will find me in room  of this hotel
ask for

ernest lumsden

 ernest lumsden i had never
heard of him

  be so good as not to refer in any
way to her father he had written
why not margaret was perfectly
aware of her fathers excavations
and knew almost as much of arche-
ology anthropology and egyptology
as he had known himself why make
no mention of something that had
been headlined in every newspaper
and journal in the english speaking
world 

  lord warrender had been crushed
to death by a falling statue in the
temple-tomb of ai goddess of the
moon i remembered again in my hotel
room how bravely margaret had taken
his death they were adventurers
those two and the true adventurer
is always ready to meet what provi-
dence may have in store for him

i knocked loudly at number 

  the door opened almost immediately
and i found myself confronted by an
elderly gentleman whose not unkind
face was lined with wrinkles his hair
was sparse and white yet he could not
have been much over fifty

  may i see mr lumsden i in-
quired

i am mr lumsden come in

  thank you i walked past him
into the room

 when he had closed the door
again he turned to me peter har-
ris he asked

  i nodded curtly

  it was good of you to come he
turned slightly and indicated a
youngish man whom i had not no-
ticed before allow me to present
the sheikh al-jubal mr peter har-

ris the egyptian wore a white
drill suit and carried a cane except
for the turban binding his swarthy
head he might easily have been mis-
taken for an englishman browned by
the hot african sun the sheikh al-
jubal bowed

 turned to lumsden again i
confess that i found your note
surprising i said rmay i know its
meaning

 lord warrender was my best
friend lumsden began quietly his
eyes steadily on me had i so much
as set foot in london in the past
twenty years you would no doubt
have known of me before this as
a dear friend of her late father i am
naturally interested in lady war-
render

  i nodded

 the sheikh al-jubal he went
on indicating once more the silent
egyptian also knew her father
well his intimate acquaintance with
the history and present state of the
valley of the moon proved invalu-
able to lord warrender in his work
here during an acquaintance that
was at first a matter of convenience
these two came to regard each other
with deep respect and friendship
he paused i hope you can see
harris that in us you have two
friends interested only in lady
warrenders welfare	

 the old mans manner and speech
convinced me of his integrity i
appreciate that i said

  good he said nodding abruptly
do you know the history of the
tombs in the valley of the moon
he asked

  im afraid i dont my knowledge
of egyptology is practically nil and
in these more unusual matters i con-
fess i know nothing at all

 lumsden turned to the sheikh
tell him al-jubal

 the sheikh addressed me for the
first time since our introduction i
looked at this dark man with the
heavy black beard the beetling
brows the thin lips he spoke in a
low pleasant voice

 ai the moon goddess is not
the vengeance of ai



egyptian yet she is the goddess of
that accursed valley vorshiped and
revered by many of our natives even
today

  he paused as if searching for a
point at which to begin and pres-
ently went on

  long years ago a wealthy chal-
dean merchant left his native land
for egypt he came personally to
barter his finest wares with egypts
princes and his stay was climaxed
by his fortunate marriage to an egyp-
tian lady of quality

  the family founded by that mar-
riage was one of the richest and
most influential during that vhole
period and the wealthy merchant
found egypt so to his liking that
he made his home here as many
others have done since when he
died the question of burial arose
despite his family and his impor-
tance he was not egyptian he de-
sired burial under the protection of
his own gods

  so a tomb was built in what has
since been called the valley of the
moon there his mummy was laid
and though he was the only for-
eigner in that resting place ai
chaldean goddess of the moon con-
tinued as the protecting deity of the
valley and of the people buried
there

  in the innermost chamber of that
first tcmb in the valley there is a
colossal statue of ai around her
neck is suspended a giant pectoral
of gold an eight-rajed disk symbol
of the divine power of ai these
facts were brought to light by lord
warrender his labor had brought
him to this inner chamber and it
was there that his work was so un-
fortunately cut short

  the egyptian ceased abruptly and
settled back

  was it that statue that crushed
him i asked

  lumsden nodded yes it was the
great statue of ai that toppled from
its base and killed lord warrender
in its fall the accident occurred
when he attempted to remove the
golden amulet from the neck of the
colossus

  isnt it odd that a statue of that
size should topple i asked

  no one thought of that until the
sheikh and i got to looking into the
matter said lumsden lord war-
render had spoken of the statue to
us pointing out that it was attached
very firmly to its base so firmly
indeed that he made much of the
fact that it would be extremely diffi-
cult to do anything with it yet the
next day it fell crushing him

  could lord warrender have been
deceived perhaps it only seemed
firmly attached i ventured

lumsden shrugged his shoulders
but the look on his face showed
his scorn for my suggestion that lord
warrender might have been in error

  perhaps you will think that we
too were deceived when the sheikh
and i found the statue of ai re-
stored to its base when we visited
the tomb after warrenders burial
before i could reply the sheikh
al-jubal cut in suddenly there
were other things do not forget
them lumsden mr harris perhaps
thinks that worshiping natives crept
into the temple-tomb at night and
righted the statue

  lumsden spread his hands yes
he said perhaps he does as a mat-
ter of fact that was exactly what i
had been thinking but lumsden went
on

  id almost forgotten-there were
other things the terror of the natives
when they saw the statue of ai and the
eight-rayed moon-disk and their sub-
sequent flight they were afraid of
something-screamed out something
about a curse and went positively
frantic when lord warrender sug-
gested removing the amulet from
about the neck of the statue

  when lord warrender went down
into the crypt to take the amulet only
two white aides were with him the
natives would not go near the tomb
nor can any of them be induced to
enter the tomb even now only the
two white men saw the statue topple
and fall just as lord warrender was
about to remove the golden disk-and
since then one of those two men has


strange stories

died a mysterious and unaccountable
death

  what are you implying i asked
the sheikh al-jubal interposed it
is not a time to beat about the bush
he said the matter is clear for those
who wish to see the desecrator of
ais temple-tomb is cursed nothing
can save him from death

  i smiled half-heartedly with an in-
solent superiority which i did not
quite feel am i expected to take this
seriously i asked

  al-jubal frowned impatiently and
lumsden looked irritated then the
sheikh spoke again with a scornful
gesture in my direction

  perhaps mr harris will consider
more seriously the as yet unexplained
death of lord warrenders successor
herbert lanseer he was found just
outside the temple-tomb of ai he
seemed to have been beaten or crushed
to death there were strange marks-
the marks of the guardians of ai those
invisible spirits who have been set to
guard the valley of the moon and
those sleeping there

again i felt uneasy if it was
this sort of nonsense   
well what has all this got to do
with lady warrender i demanded

  everything in the world said
lumsden quietly lady warrender
is somewhat less skeptical than you
i was astounded do you mean to
say that margaret scientist that she
is actually believes her father to have
been killed by the vengeance of ai-
and that other man lanseer i think
you called him

 lumsden looked away sighing
gently yes he said she believes
that-and more she believes much
more there is another native belief
which might interest you

  and that i asked finding it some-
what difficult to keep the scorn i felt
from my voice

  the sheikh spoke again as ai
cursed her fathers life so has ai
cursed his death as she avenged her-
self on his body so she still avenges
herself on his invisible soul she has
condemned his spirit by the power of
her curse to run always with the guar-
dians of the valley when they go from

tomb to tomb on the night of the full
moon sometimes mr harris they
have been seen

 have you seen them i asked
sharply

  no said lumsden at once but it
is not always necessary to see

  i came to my feet i took my hat
from the table thank you i said
for your kind intentions but this
sounds like pretty tall stuff to me im
sorry i walked toward the door

  but before i reached it the door
swung open and a native garbed in
conventional english clothes burst
into the room something had hap-
pened that concerned the two men to
whom i had been speaking for both
stared at the stranger with apprehen-
sive faces after a quick glance at me
he addressed lumsden and the sheikh

  lattal has been found near the
tomb where you thought his head is
beaten in-like the others-lanseer
and weatherbee

  lumsden and the sheikh looked at
me i felt my confident superiority
crumbling i turned from the door
looking from lumsden to the sheikh
who is lattal i asked but already
a premonition was forming in my
mind

  lattal said lumsden was the
other of the two men who saw the
statue crush lord warrender weath-
erbee was the first both of them left
their hotel at dead of night without
a word to anyone lattal went as if in
a daze-as if some power outside him-
self was drawing him away from the
city is it asking too much of you to
believe that lattals death is linked to
the other three by the power of ais
curse or do you think these deaths
a series of remarkable coincidences
mr harris

  it was with a confidence i was far
from feeling that i hedged stranger
coincidences have happened i turned
to the door again with an effort

  lumsden was there before me lis-
ten harris he said not unkindly i
know how difficult belief must be for
you i understand your attitude but
remember margaret you dont real-
ize the nervous condition this has
brought her to go to her if you must
but do not mention her father if she
the vengeance of ai



chooses to bring him up herself there
is nothing to be done about it were
trying to keep her mind off it were
urging her to go back to london
youve got to help

  i put out my hand and took his
theres nothing id like better than
to see lady warrender back in lon-
don i said nothing you may
count on me-but as for this super-
natural business thats out abso-
lutely

  i understand but margaret will
not return until she is convinced that
her fathers spirit is not bound to run
with the guardians of the temple-tomb
of ai

  then you yourself do not believe
i asked quickly

  you misunderstand me harris i
do he replied quietly but the im-
portant thing is to convince margaret
that the legend is untrue

  he bowed slightly and opened the
door the sheikh al-jubal raised his
hand in a farewell gesture i heard
lumsden sigh as i walked past him
into the hall

  i went out into the bright streets of
cairo heading for the hotel memphis
and margaret i admit that my confi-
dence was severely shaken something
i had not cared to show lumsden and
the sheikh yet i could not wholly
believe in a mythical curse nor could
i believe that margaret so sure of her-
self and her science-margaret so se-
rene so rational and urbane-could
credit the existence of such a curse i
brushed the suggestion aside looking
forward to seeing her again and
thought that by christmas we could be
married

  i looked for margaret on the green
terrace of the hotel memphis in a
moment i saw her sitting alone by a
table just tinder the wall her face
was pressed into her hands and her
attitude was strangely dejected i
walked quickly to where she sat and
stopped beside her she was not aware
of me until i said hello

  then she lifted her head slowly and
looked up at me she smiled and came
to her feet peter you surprised me
she cried but her voice was listless

  is that your only welcome i
asked gently chiding

  im glad you came peter so glad
i need you for a moment there was
intensity in her voice and an unusual
emphasis perhaps lumsden had been
right after all

  ive come to take you back to lon-
don i said watching her closely
hopefully

  she looked at me her face expres-
sionless i dont know when i can
go back

  i watched her face under her large
hat i saw her heavily shadowed eyes
the line of strain across her forehead
the frightened expression of her lips
theres something wrong with you
my dear i said cant you tell me
what it is

for a time she said nothing yes
i thought lumsden was right she
is going to tell about it now i had the
uneasy belief that she was going to
reiterate everything lumsden and the
sheikh al-jubal had already told me

  you remember asid my fathers
servant who stayed here in cairo after
his death

  i nodded

  he was very dear to us he had
always been utterly faithful scrupu-
lously honest about a week before i
left london i had a letter from him
in it he said that there were strange
things happening about the tomb of
ai in the valley of the moon there
were stories of weird ghostly figures
running each night the moon rose full
asid had seen them he wrote and
one of them was my father

  she trembled a little

  at first i didnt believe it but it
worked on me it grew on me the
idea of the spirit of my father haunt-
ing the valley of the moon together
with the native guardian spirits be-
came so terrible that i had to come
and i will not return to london until
i have seen with my own eyes that my
father is not there

  i said you dont believe that mar-
garet

  she looked at me i dont know
she said there are strange things
here in egypt stories of weird unbe-
lievable curses

  i brushed this aside impatiently
she broke into speech again


strange stories

  on the night of the last full moon
i went out there with asid he in-
sisted that i come an old friend of
my fathers went along ernest lums-
den i went because i wanted to prove
to him that there was nothing could
be nothing mr lumsden did not want
me to go but i went i dont know
what it was i saw i think it was my
father there was something yes
but perhaps it was because of asid be-
lieving in it so strongly we stood a
little way from the tomb of ai sud-
denly he clutched my wrist in his
hand pressed it hard in his excite-
ment and said there do you see
them lady running running- and
i thought i did-naked natives and
my father dressed as he was when he
died

  peter ive got to see it through
tomorrow is another full moon im
going out there again without asid
this time ill make sure tomorrow
morning early ernest lumsden and
the sheikh al-jubal are going too
and i want you to come i need you
with me

  and if there is nothing i said
will you go back to london with
me

  she nodded

  i imagine that our cavalcade start-
ing slowly out of cairo before dawn
the next morning would have seemed
an ordinary tourists expedition to the
casual observer he would have seen
a lady and three men the ladys maid
and two guides

  our horses took us out of the gray
city and into the shadowed desert
lumsden went ahead with a motor-
lorry carrying a searchlight and tent-
ing equipment we hoped to reach
the valley of the moon before the hot-
test part of the day though it was a
good seventy miles out of cairo in
the desert with cairo already disap-
pearing under the dunes behind us
the first glimmerings of dawn break-
ing in the sky our purpose seemed
vague and faraway to me

  once at the valley of the moon the
guides helped us throw up the tents
water was drawn under the palms
that sheltered the tombs and rugs
were spread then with the guides
on guard the rest of us retired to the

shelter of our tents and there we
rested until the sun had set that night
in the shadowy evening we ate a light
supper and the guides prepared rugs
before the tents for the watch a camp
chair was put in place for margaret to
rest on

  the sudden night of the desert came
down with startling abruptness our
camp was enshrouded in blackness
with the dying campfire flickering near
the tents sitting there i heard the
sheikh al-jubal call to lumsden is
the searchlight in order

  lumsden called back yes ill take
care of it

  i began to wonder suddenly why a
searchlight had been brought but my
thoughts were diverted by the faint
yellow light that came suddenly into
being above the edge of the desert and
then the rim of the round moon began
its slow climb over the horizon we
waited tensely saying little watching
for the moment when the moon would
be wholly above the sand when the
faint reddish glow would strike the
entrance to the great tomb of ai mar-
garet strained forward her eyes fixed
on the now hazily lighted row of
tombs there was not a sound in the
night i felt uneasy

  are you all right dear i whis-
pered

she did not turn but i felt her
hand on mine she nodded quickly
not wanting to speak then suddenly
she started forward listen she
murmured tensely the moon had
topped the desert i looked into her
face

  at that moment the sheikh shouted
the light lumsden the light and
before margarets eyes were focused
on the tomb of ai again the great
white light was trained there moving
slowly across the face of the tomb
then away down the line of tombs in
the valley of the moon a sudden
wind had come up a rushing sound
in the night slowly the ray moved
from tomb to tomb margaret leaning
forward tensely watching its path
but there was nothing living in its
light back came the ray again to the
great tomb of ai and once more it de-
scried a circle there was nothing
the vengeance of ai



and the sudden strange wind died as
suddenly as it came

  margaret fell back in her chair
nothing she murmured peter
there was nothing

 of course not i exulted of
course not

  it was asid wishing so intensely
to believe in his native legends she
went on she turned radiant eyes on
me well start for england this
week tomorrow

  we turned in to get what sleep we
could before our early trek back but
i could not sleep i lay for what
seemed a long time awake in the still-
ness and then abruptly i heard the
sound of hushed voices and the pecu-
liar padding of feet in the sand i rose
on my elbow and listened then i
crept stealthily to the opening in the
tent and peered out lumsden and the
sheikh were walking rapidly toward
the tomb of ai in a moment i was
out of the tent and had joined them

i assumed readily enough that
these two were likewise unable to
sleep i wanted to jibe at them for
their belief in the legend which i had
seen disproved yet i could not come
directly out and speak

  tell me i asked after whispered
greetings had been exchanged why
did you move that searchlight so
slowly 

  it was necessary for me to approxi-
mate the speed of running men re-
plied lumsden without a moments
hesitation i had to keep them in that
blinding light so that she wouldnt
see   

  good god lumsden dont tell me
you still believe-

  both he and the sheikh smiled gent-
ly together we came to a stop lums-
dens stick was pointing downward
and both lumsden and al-jubal were
looking at the sand we were standing
just outside the great tomb of ai

  i looked down there in the sand
i knew unmolested by wind for there
had been very little wind all that
night were little pits as if many feet
had been running there then a cry
escaped me

  before me in the center of that run-
ning line i saw a single track a deeper

track a track that showed clear and
distinct on the wettish sand under the
overhanging palm trees-the track of
feet wearing shoes

  even as i looked the sheikh al-
jubal began methodically to scuff
away the traces following the wide
circle while lumsden went back along
the trail all my cocksure confidence
had left me i understood that these
two were obliterating this definite
proof of the curse of ai so that mar-
garet might not see in the morning

  lumsden turned to me the first
part of the task i have set for myself
is finished harris margaret will re-
turn to london now-and you must go
with her before i leave the valley of
the moon in the morning i am going
to try to break the curse that binds
warrenders spirit to the tomb of ai

  then i will help you i said
rashly

  a quick glance flashed between the
sheikh and lumsden i detected ap-
proval in the sheikhs eyes and felt
strengthened in my resolve lumsden
did not protest and in consequence i
witnessed a phenomenon which has
immeasurably strengthened my belief
in the powers of light and darkness

  lumsden and the sheikh had come
prepared

  a large circle was first drawn in the
sand a short distance away from the
temple-tomb of ai and both lumsden
and the sheikh stepped within but
when i made as if to follow them they
waved me back

  you can help best harris by mount-
ing guard over lady warrenders
tent said lumsden you will be able
to watch quite clearly and should any-
thing approach the tent you will be
there

  i did not argue but returned at
once to the tent nevertheless i went
back with a sharp feeling of disap-
pointment i took my stand near the
opening of margarets tent and
watched the strange ceremony that
took place within the circle the sheikh
had drawn in the sand

  it was the sheikh who began the
ceremony murmuring a cryptic incan-
tation in his native language pres-
ently the great door of the tomb of ai
began to glow a weird reddish fire


strange stories

seeming to spread over it outlining it

  then suddenly a group of strange
lifeless figures began to drift from the
closed door-naked natives padding
automatically outward toward the cir-
cle occupied by lumsden and al-
jubal they moved toward the circle
white and ghostly stretching out their
arms toward the two who sat there
yet unable to break into the circle

  they passed around it billowing
forward and back like a wave a silent
sea of ghastly horror a feeling of
terror crept into me i dared not think
what might happen should these fig-
ures from the tomb turn toward mar-
garets tent

my attention was attracted to the
tomb for from it emerged a
single figure white and still-lord
warrender his diaphanous shape was
clear and distinct his rugged face was
drawn tight emotionless he came for-
ward slowly toward the circle i
glanced hastily toward the sheikh and
lumsden they were leaning excited-
ly forward and lumsden had moved
to the very efige of the circle oblivi-
ous to the hands stretched out toward
him held back only by that invisible
wall created in some manner by the
strange magic known to the sheikh

  the shadowy lord warrender ap-
proached the circle and as he arrived
at its outer edge the sheikh rose up
and thundered forth a sentence that
scattered the native spirits reaching
toward the two in the circle at that
moment lumsden broke the circle and
lord warrenders vague form drifted
through at once lumsden closed the
circle again

  then a strange thing happened the
ghostly shadow of lord warrender
began to collapse sinking into the
ground

  only when it had completely disap-
peared did the sheikh turn his atten-
tion again to the guardian spirits of
the tomb of ai he began now to drive
them back into the tomb they fought

silently to reach beyond the circle
then gradually their ghastly intent
weakened they turned reluctantly and
shuffled in weird procession back to
the tomb through the door of which
they returned as they had come the
glow began to fade away from the
tomb and in a few moments the sheikh
and lumsden left the circle and came
wearily over to me i went forward to
meet them

  he will run no more harris said
lumsden then he looked gently at
the tent which hid margaret from us
shook his head a little and said take
care of her and get her away at once
in the morning i dont want her here
if anything should happen it is not
always easy to break a curse and
sometimes there is a penalty

  i disregarded his enigmatic words
then but a month later a letter came
from lumsden it was a letter of fare-
well he wrote at some length ram-
bling on for pages but the point of his
letter lay in his last pathetic para-
graph 

  al-jubal was found today--near the
tomb he went from the hotel in the night
-like the others-drawn by a power we
are unable to combat soon i must go too
i have been given a short period of grace
i feel-but the end is in sight i told you
that it is not easy for mere man to break
an ancient curse as we did that night on the
desert-and i foresaw what might happen
that is why i did not let you come into the
circle with us-so that the vengeance of ai
might not pursue you as it has pursued al-
jubal and as it must pursue me-soon we
must pay with our lives for breaking the
curse of ai good-by

  the letter i sent in answer was re-
turned marked cannot be found
inquiries i set on foot brought for-
ward little ernest lumsden had been
seen walking from his hotel one night
shortly after twelve that was the last
seen of him yet i know what hap-
pened i have spared margaret now
my wife this knowledge and hope
that no hint of the fate of lumsden
and the sheikh al-jubal ever reaches
her i do not think it will

strange

stories

in the past and when dale eliot talked
he brought the past to life

  there was something ghostly about
him he seemed to have stepped from
the past into the present a frozen
swimmer emerging from the river of
time near its dim beginnings with
the hoary foam of centuries clinging
to his garments

  but in this old witch house dale
eliot was in his element

  the witch house had been converted
into a museum for the edification of
summer tourists it was the third old-
est house in salem and it stood on a
high wind-swept bluff overlooking
salem harbor

  it did not attract tourists as the
house of seven gables did it was a
drab squat little house with a gambrel
roof that did not jut out as gambrel
roofs should bleakly it faced the har-
bor presenting to the town merely a
windowless expanse of weather-eroded
wood which impressed antiquarians
but left normal people cold

  dale eliot was in all respects the
exact opposite of a normal person he
moved about in a kind of trance ex-
amining objects which were unique in
the annals of salem a spinning wheel
which had once belonged to a notori-
ous witch a dog-eared prayer book
annotated in the curious cramped cal-
ligraphy of the reverend increase
mather dour son of a grim and re-
lentless father dour father of a son
who had left red thumb prints on the
darkest pages of new england his-
tory

  all of the treasured antiques were
roped off but eliot was contemptuous
of the do not touch signs scattered
about the room when he saw an ob-
ject which attracted him he approached
it crept under the ropes and examined
it with his hands he liked the feel of
old things

  now he was examining a cabinet of
drawers which stood under a small-
paned window on the north side of
the room examining it all over run-
ning his hands over it in critical ap-
praisal and even pulling the drawers
in and out as he crouched in the
gloom

  too bad too bad he murmured
the panels are badly warped

  he was tugging at the lowermost
drawer and balancing himself pre-
cariously on his instep when the little
figure emerged

  it emerged so unobtrusively that he
did not notice it until it was standing
almost directly beneath his hand
blinking up at him in the dim yellow
light which suffused the ancient room
weirdly

  the figure was scarcely three inches
in height-a tiny shriveled human
baroque with pointed ears and a thin
hairy tail peaked and dun-colored it
stood very still on the top of the cab-
inet and stared malignly up at him its
tiny face repulsively puckered its
shoulders hunched and misshapen

  eliots flesh congealed instinctively
he retreated a pace his pupils dilating
his breath hissing from between his
teeth

  do not be alarmed dale eliot
shrilled the little horror i am your
familiar i have waited here for you
throughout the years

  familiar gasped eliot his face
corpse white

  yes your family familiar your
great-great-grandfather was a member
of a covin in good standing i at-
tached myself to all of your ancestors
you were born in this house dont
you remember dale eliot

  eliot passed a trembling hand across
his brow i knew that i was born in
salem he said but i did not remem-
ber the house my mother died when
i was a child i was brought up by
relatives in boston

  the little figure nodded grimly
well dale we are together again i
remember you as an infant rosy-
cheeked smiling but with the mark of
his satanic majesty already upon
you

 you mean - my ancestors were
witches eliot asked in a small voice

the figure nodded yes dale
witches and warlocks your
entire family attached themselves to
his satanic majesty far back in the
seventeenth century

  before eliot could protest or cry
out the little figure leaped upon him
tiny clawlike hands fastened on his
clothes and clung with a cry eliot
the creeper in darkness



staggered back across the room his
fingers clutching at his chest

  the little horror was burrowing un-
der his shirt when the guard rushed
angrily into the room the guard was
a big heavy-set man of portuguese
extraction dressed in summer linens

  look here sir he exclaimed you
cant yell like that in here this is a
private house which is only open for
antickarians

  eliot did not reply he was backed
up against the wall his fingers claw-
ing at his chest the little figure was
burrowing into his flesh he could
feel it squirming about under his
clothes

  the guard said drunk eh a fine
thing and you a grown man

  he jerked a thumb toward the door-
way of the room out he said if
you dont get out under your own
steam ill help you out

  eliot got out he staggered blindly
out of the room and down a winding
flight of stairs to the street the sun-
light was clear and bright over salem
when he emerged on the high wind-
swept hill overlooking the harbor

  but when he reached his lodgings a
half-mile away the sun westering was
spilling down like blood splashingly
ensanguining the gambrel roofs and
red brick chimney pots of the old
houses and turning the waters of
salem harbor a deep rosy pink

  eliots room was on the top floor of a
three-story frame house on a winding
waterfront street where hollyhocks
bloomed he was trembling uncon-
trollably when he crossed a well-kept
lawn and ascended a porch which
creaked beneath his tread

his blue eyes a mixture of stupe-
faction and terror he fumbled
for his keys let himself into the house
and mounted three flights of stairs to
his attic room

  he locked the door of the room
before he crossed to the window and
sat down on a narrow cotlike bed he
sat down on the edge of the bed and
removed his coat he was wearing a
soft linen shirt and black bow tie he
ripped off the tie unbuttoned the
shirt and removed it ripped off his
undershirt

  the little baroque was clinging to
his chest its tiny hands were buried
wrist-deep in his flesh all about it
there was a glistening crimson circle
a halo of bright blood for an instant
he stared down in silence at the tiny
shriveled form so great were his hor-
ror and revulsion that for an instant
the room swayed about him for an
instant he thought he was going to
faint

 the tiny shape was staring mali-
ciously up at him in the red sunlight
which poured in through the open
window crimsoning the sheets of the
bed from its narrow sloping skull
two tiny black horns sprouted in the
dim light of the old house eliot had
failed to notice the horns

 utter horror engulfed him as he
stared

  the little baroque said it will take
three days when i have firmly at-
tached myself i will never leave you
eliot spoke to it then he scarcely
recognized his own voice it seemed
like a whisper from the grave

 you mean your hands will grow
into my flesh

 yes dale the wounds will heal
and your flesh will become covin flesh
and will obey the commands of his
satanic majesty see i have made
grooves for my hands eventually the
wounds will heal

  the little horror leaped suddenly
from his chest to the sun-reddened
windowsill and stood perilously
poised in the crimson glow mocking
him

 the two deep grooves where its
hands had rested were welling redly

  the little baroque said night is
falling i must sleep

  eliot went perfectly white when the
little horror leaped back upon him in-
serted its hands into the encrimsoned
grooves and coiled up in an attitude of
repose

  sleep dale it murmured as its
eyelids flickered shut you will not
resent me so much tomorrow and in
the months and years to come you will
not resent me at all

  how eliot passed the night he never
knew his thoughts were feverish de-
lirious he twisted and turned a dark
ferment in his brain twisted and


strange stories

turned until the dawn broke in the
east outside the window of his room

  when he awoke sunlight was flood-
ing the attic room a confused and
merciful forgetfulness pervaded his
faculties slowly his drowsy eyes took
in the familiar contours of the room
the sloping rafters of the ceiling that
came to a triangular focus high above
his head the oaken chest where his
clothes lay a dresser with a photo-
graph of his mother and a brush comb
and hand-mirror familiarly arranged
upon it x

  then he glanced down at the sheet
which covered him and the horror
came rushing back filling him with
unutterable terror and loathing

 across the white sheet there
stretched a long trail of tiny bloody
footprints

  with a despairing cry he threw the
sheets off and glanced down at his
naked torso the little shape was stir-
ring restlessly in his flesh suddenly
it opened its eyes and stared up at
him

  good morning dale it said

  he made no attempt to dislodge it
he could not bring himself to touch
it shaking in every limb he arose
from the bid and put on his clothes
he dressed swiftly while the little hor-
ror mocked him

the wounds in eliots flesh were
of a deep violaceous hue the
blood had darkened coagulated
slowly the little malign baroque with-
drew its hands and leaped to the win-
dowsill it watched mockingly while
eliot struggled into his shirt and
drew on his coat

  the big clock in the hall outside
was ticking slowly when eliot de-
scended the stairs to the street the
little horror was squirming in his flesh
again twisting about restlessly under
his shirt

  eliot usually glanced at the morn-
ing paper before he let himself out
but now he simply pulled the paper
from beneath the door and stuffed it
in his coat pocket going down the
steps of the porch and crossing the
lawn with the swaying gait of a
drunken man

  his one thought was to escape from

the horror by seeking the companion-
ship of normal people to escape for
an instant from his terror by mingling
with normal men and women perhaps
it was all a mad illusion perhaps he
was entirely mad

  he must find out when he arrived
at the little restaurant where he usu-
ally had breakfast he had reached a
momentous decision he would enter
the restaurant sit down and tear the
horror from his flesh he would expose
it to the gaze of the people about him

  he had to share the horror it was
driving him mad at the little restau-
rant where he usually had breakfast
he would meet people he knew kind-
ly sympathetic people he must find
out

 the restaurant was less crowded
than usual unsteadily he crossed to
a table in a far corner picked up a
menu and glanced furtively about
him

  none of his acquaintances was hav-
ing breakfast at the restaurant this
morning the people who were sit-
ting there were complete strangers to
him nevertheless he was determined
to bring the horror into view

 he could imagine what they would
say

  god what a ghastly thing

 what can it be 

  its like a little man

  he could see the patrons of the res-
taurant rising in sudden terror upset-
ting their coffee-cups sending plates
crashing to the floor but he had to
have human sympathy and under-
standing he had to know

 he was fumbling with the buttons
of his shirt when he heard the man at
the adjoining table say

  no they cant explain it he was
found in his shop with his head bitten
off chewed off the medical exam-
iner said it looked like a rat had
chewed through the flesh of his
throat

  there were two men at the adjoin-
ing table now the second man was
speaking and they found little red
footprints all over the shop human
footprints a tenth of an inch in length
now thats a puzzler for you

  ghastly said the first man he
raised a cup of coffee to his lips eliot
the creeper in darkness



saw his adams apple rise and fall rise
and fall he was drinking all the
scalding coffee at a single draught as
though the scalding horror in his mind
was so unbearable that he had to scald
his throat to keep from thinking of it

  suppose we talk about something
else said the second man

  yeah lets its all in the papers
anyway we can read about it later
on

  with trembling fingers eliot ripped
the salem morning chronicle from his
pocket and spread it out on the table
before him

  the headlines fairly screamed at
him antiquarian found murdered
and in smaller type beneath joseph
taylor prominent antiquarian of this
city was found gruesomely murdered
this morning in his antique shop at 
elm street mr taylor who has liv-
ing quarters at the rear of the shop
was found at  a m by-

  eliot rose from the table choking
his face livid he staggered out of the
restaurant into the blinding sunlight
the sunlight smote his eyes dazzling
and half-blinding him

  indifferent to the glare clutching at
his throat he reeled drunkenly down
the street

  disturbed by his reeling gait the
little baroque crept from beneath his
shirt and stared coldly up at him

  well what is the matter now
what is the matter with you dale
eliot

  you killed him eliot choked jo-
seph taylor my friend yesterday
afternoon when i left his shop he
was alive and well

  the little baroque shrilled yes i
know you were furiously angry with
him when you left the shop he tried
to cheat you he attempted to sell you
a spurious antique you swore to get
even with him dale

  but i didnt really mean it eliot
choked i didnt know-

  dale listen to me i killed him be-
cause you hated him i am your faith-
ful familiar a familiar is pledged to
execute its masters wishes all wiz-
ards magicians and warlocks have evil
wishes

  eliot screamed you murderous
little devil his fingers went out and

raked across his chest agilely the lit-
tle horror leaped aside and climbed to
eliots shoulder where it leered up
into his face in malign derision

  of course i am a devil a demon
a little devil

  eliot groaned i will crush you to
death i will strangle you with my
hands

  the little shape shrilled you can-
not destroy me dale i would slip
from your grasp i am elastic inde-
structible

  then i will destroy myself

  no dale i will grow into your
flesh and you will cease to hate me

  a child ran so swiftly past him that
eliot did not at first realize that he
was not alone with the horror on the
sun-dappled pavement he did not
know that a little girl on her way to
school had been watching him with
wide wondering eyes and had now
run swiftly by

  the child had seen the little figure
perched on his shoulder and was run-
ning screaming away from him her
school books clutched tightly in her
arms her pigtails flying suddenly
she dashed out into the street

eliot was so immersed in horror
that he saw the child merely as a
white blur moving swiftly through the
sunlight

  the street climbed steeply to a bluff
overlooking the bay the child was
running up the street but the automo-
bile was coming down it was coming
down with a screeching of brakes and
although the man in the car was try-
ing desperately to avoid running down
the child he had seen her too late to
swerve aside

  the screeching brakes jarred eliot
from his daze his vision cleared he
saw the child clearly saw the careen-
ing car

  the car was less than twenty feet
from the running child when he leaped
with a cry from the pavement

  he leaped toward the child and gave
her a violent push sending her sprawl-
ing across the street to safety

  the car was traveling at thirty miles
when it struck him it smashed into


strange stories

him and hurled him thirty feet through
the air with a grinding scream it
jolted to a halt turning completely
about on the steep gradient

  eliot thudded to the pavement and
lay still blood trickling from his face
sobbing with terror the child picked
herself up and stared at the little form
that was running from eliots sprawl-
ing body across the pavement

  three feet from the curb the fleeing
baroque staggered swayed its tiny
hands went to his throat it screamed
in shrill agony it whirled about like
a top then it tottered sideways and
collapsed in a heap in the dust of the
gutter

hen he who had nearly run down
the child emerged white-lipped
and trembling from the car the little
shape was as unmoving as eliots big
bulk spread out on the pavement

  eliot awoke in a world of whiteness
he was lying on a soft mattress be-
tween white sheets and the walls of
the room were white and so was the
ceiling above him when he moved
white-hot shafts of searing pain shot
through him

  the girl who was bending above him
and smiling down at him was dressed
entirely in white

  she laid a soft white hand on his
forehead you must rest now she
said you must get some sleep
youve been unconscious for hours
who-who are you gasped eliot
and wrhere where-

  you are in the salem general hos-
pital said the girl i am your night
nurse

 but what happened

  you were struck by an automobile 
this morning you saved the life of a
little girl

  eliot remembered then he started
so violently that the nurse was com-
pelled to admonish him you must
try not to think about that later if
you wish but not now you must get
some sleep

  eliot groaned sleep sleep how
can i rest when that little monster-
the girl said you mean your good
luck piece weve all been admiring
it you havent lost it it is quite safe
they found it in the dust of the road-

way a few feet from where you were
lying

  eliot stared at her white-lipped
what do you mean what did you
find

  the girl smiled and left him when
she returned she was holding a small
flat object that glittered in the palm of
her hand

  here it is she said would you
like it near you

  tremulously eliot took the little
baroque it was cold and metallic and
very flat now-a tiny rigid figurine of
bronze

  the nurse said what an ugly lit-
tle horror wherever did you get it
i have seen some unusual good luck
charms-my uncle collects them-but
this little bronze is unique ive never
seen a duplicate

  she smiled it is a little too large
to wear on a watch chain you just
carry it loose in your pocket i sup-
pose it certainly brought you luck
this morning

 eliot remembered then remem-
bered a passage from an old book
which he had read somewhere in the
course of his antiquarian browsings
and witchcraft studies

  even warlocks may be saved even
witches and black sorcerers by hero-
ism and sacrifice and repentance may
warlocks be saved and each demon
that cannot abide goodness will shrivel
and become as bronze forsaking its
warlock when its warlock forsakes the
evil one dying in agony shriveling
and dying

  eliots eyes were shining strangely
when he took the nurses hand and de-
posited the little metallic figure on
her palm

 you say your uncle collects
charms

  the girl nodded

  then give this to him with my
blessings

  the nurse gasped you-you dont
want it

  eliot smiled wanly i never want
to see it again he said i have lived
too long among antiques i shall live
henceforth among people-talk with
them laugh with them work with
them-yes people are better than an-
tiques    people are best

in under the doorway that made
sharp division between the glare of
california sunlight outside and the
lofty shadows of obyrnes long dim
studio

 i hope youre right he said
around the cigar ive waited a long
time for it and god knows youve

photography and sound recording are bound by a
man-made limit-and beyond that lies madness


strange stories

spent more years than you ought
and more money than even you could
afford why have you done it blair
a man with your money your back-
ground shutting yourself up here in
the dark sweating over shadows
i havent been shut up away from
life-ive been shut in with it
obyrnes smile spread across the
pallor of his delicate face its life
itself ive been groping after all
these years and ive found it abe
ive got it

  got the illusion of it maybe a
little better than metro-cosmic has
been filming for the last few years
and if its as good as you say well
buy it-and so what

  obyrne turned to him fiercely his
dream-haunted eyes suddenly blazing

  i tell you this is life as near as
shadows can come-too near per-
haps moving pictures theyll have
to find a new name for what ive
got it isnt pictures-its breath-
ing living reality ive worked over
it until nothing else seemed to mat-
ter nothing else seemed real ive
got it abe its-life

abe silvers shifted the cigar
back across his mouth and if his
eyes were understanding his voice was
only patient he had heard such
words before from many fiercely sin-
cere inventors that he had known
obyrne for many years did not alter
his accustomed attitude toward such
things

  all right he murmured show me
wheres the projection room blair
here obyrne waved a thin un-
steady hand toward the center of the
big studio where under a battery of
high-hung lights a u-shaped bar of
dull silver rose from a low platform
to the height of a mans waist be-
yond it against the wall bulked a big
rectangular arrangement of chromium
and glass behind whose face bulbs
were dimly visible silvers snorted

  there that thing looks like a
radio-that doubled-over pipe but
the screen man-the seats-the-
im telling you this is utterly
new abe youll have to clear your
mind of all your preconceived ideas

of what a moving picture should be
all that is obsolete from this minute
on the moving picture is as dead
as the magic lantern this is the new
thing these batteries of lights that
radio as you call it the platform
and bar one for each individual spec-
tator-

  but what is it what happens

  i cant explain it to you now
said obyrne impatiently for one
thing you wouldnt believe me until
after youve seen it and it would
take weeks to give you enough
ground-work to understand the prin-
ciples the things too complex for
anyone to explain in words i cant
even explain the appearance except
in metaphors-theres never been any-
thing like it before

  roughly though its the projec-
tion of the illusion of life on a three-
dimensional screen composed of
fogged light other men are just
beginning to fumble around with the
principles of three-dimensional mov-
ies projected on a flat screen giving
the appearance of a stage with depth
thats going at it clumsily ive ap-
proached the problem from a much
newer angle my screen itself is
three-dimensional - the light that
bathes you when the batteries of arcs
are on youre in the midst of it the
action is projected on the light all
around you from double films taken
from slightly different angles on the
stereoscopic principle ill show you
later

  and there is in that bar youre to
hold on to sufficient current to stim-
ulate very selectively the nerves
which carry tactile impression to the
brain youll feel as well as hear and
see youll even smell on occasion
you may actually taste - its close
enough to the sensations of smelling
to work out only that doesnt figure
so much in this case for you as a
spectator will not enter into the ac-
tion youll simply witness it from
closer quarters than any audience has
ever dreamed of doing before

  here step up on the platform and
take hold of the rod there at the
curve thats it now hold tight
and dont be surprised remember
miracle in three dimensions



nothing like this has ever been done
before ready

  abruptly the great banks of lights
blazed into radiance that closed the
dazzled silvers about in soft pour-
ing brightness there was a quality
of mistiness about it that made even
his own hands invisible before him
on the bar it was as if the light
poured upon innumerable motes in
the air so refracting from their in-
finitesimal surfaces that nothing was
visible but that shimmer of bright
blindness silvers gripped the bar
and waited

  through the bright fog a voice as
smooth as cream spoke in vast clear
echoes rolling in from all around
him at once filling the little artificial
world of mist wherein he stood lost
mellowly the deep tones said

 you are about to enter an en-
chanted wood outside athens on a
midsummer night to share in a dream
that shakespeare dreamed over three
hundred years ago titania queen of
faeryland will be played by anne
acton oberon the king is philip
graves-

 abe silvers clutched the bar in
amazement as that unctuous voice
rolled on anne acton and philip
graves were under contract to his
own metro-cosmic and every one of
the other names were stars of the
first magnitude the greatest actors
of the day were playing in this in-
credible fragment of a midsummer
nights dream what it had cost
obyrne he shuddered to think

 the creamy voice died away the
mist began to clear silvers hands
closed hard on the bar and he stared
in blankest incredulity about the dim
blue glades of forest stretching
around him silvery in the light of a
high-riding moon a breeze whis-
pered through the leaves blowing
cool on his face save that it did not
stir a hair of his head he could have
believed it an actual breeze sighing
through the moonlit dark

 he looked down he was himself
invisible disembodied no longer
standing on a bare floor but in the
midst of a flowering meadow whose
grasses were faintly fragrant at his

feet there was no flicker no visible
light-and-shadow composition of the
projection upon this incredible three-
dimensional screen that surrounded
him the glade stretched away into
actual distances much deeper than
the studios walls could possibly con-
tain the illusion of deep starry sky
overhead was perfect the flowers in
the grass were so real he thought he
could have knelt and gathered them
in his hands

 then under the trees the mists
parted like a curtain and the queen
of faeryland came splendidly into
the moonlit glade anne acton had
never looked so lovely the long veil
of her silver-pale hair streamed like
gossamer behind her and every curve
and shadowy roundness was as real
as life itself yet there hovered about
her a hint of unreality so that she
blended perfectly the illusion of fan-
tasy and reality as she moved over
the unbending grass the bright wings
streaming from her shoulders

there was a blast of silvery chal-
lenge from elfin horns and into the
moonlight strode oberon his lean
features wrathful the famous deep
tones of philip graves resounded an-
grily through the moonlight titania
answered in silvery defiance

  then came full rich human voices
ringing through the wood phoebe
templeton in hermias rustling satin
came radiantly into the glade brush-
ing so close by the watching silvers
that he caught a whiff of her per-
fume felt the touch of her satin
skirts and he knew-almost he knew
-that he could put out a hand and
stop her so warmly real was she at
that close range her lovely throaty
voice called to lysander behind her

 and then somehow the forest was
slipping away past abe silvers face
-somehow he had the illusion of
walking as if in a dream down an en-
chanted forest aisle the dim air
quivering with starlight and helena
came running and weeping through
the trees stumbling sobbing the
name of demetrius

  she passed silvers started invol-
untarily as from a swaying branch


strange stories

above him pealed the wild half-
human laughter of puck delicate as
the chatter of a squirrel and down
through the air over his very shoul-
der the breeze of his passing fanning
silvers face the lithe little goblin
sprang

 the scene clouded over as if a
mist had been drawn across the moon
silvers blinked involuntarily and
when he looked again titania lay ex-
quisitely asleep on the dew-spangled
bank where the wild thyme grew

 then through the magic-haunted
wood suddenly shrilled a bell in-
sistently metallically it rang sil-
vers glanced about the glades of the
forest trying to locate among the
dew-shimmering leaves the source of
that irritating noise and suddenly
the athenian woods melted like
smoke about him incredulously he
stared around a big bare studio it
was like waking in bewilderment
from a dream so vivid that reality
itself paled beside its memory

  the studio wants you on the tele-
phone abe said obyrnes voice
here wake up didnt you hear the
bell

silvers shook himself laughed
sheepishly

  im still in athens he admitted
blinking thats the damnedest thing

i	ever-studio did you say wheres
the phone

 thinly over the wire came a wor-
ried voice

  hate to bother you chief but i
think you ought to know anne ac-
tons been mumbling around in a sort
of daze for half an hour the doctor
cant do a thing with her and philip
graves passed out on set and is just
kind of whispering to himself-
poetry it sounds like

  silvers blinked d-dont let the
papers get it ill be right over

 he slammed the telephone back on
its cradle and turned blankly to
obyrne

 somethings gone wrong with a
couple of our actors you stole he
said tve got to get back right
away but listen blair-youve got
something how long will it take

you to have some more of these bar
and platform arrangements rigged
up say a dozen for a starter id
like to have our board see it as soon
as possible this is going to be the
most tremendous thing that ever hap-
pened in motion pictures when
can you have things ready to show
the board

 i-i dont know abe somehow-
im a little afraid of it

 afraid good god man what do
you mean

 i dont know exactly-but did
you have a feeling as you watched
the action that somehow it came-
too near-to life

 blair - im afraid youve been
working too hard on this let me
handle it from now on will you
and stop thinking about it ive got
to get back to the studio now and
see whats happened to my actors-
attack of temperament probably-but
ill see you tonight about quantity
production until then you wont let
anyone else in on this will you
you know i wont abe its yours
if you want it

 all the way back to the studio
silvers mind was spinning with the
magnitude of what lay before him
he had dared to let the inventor
know how enormously impressed he
was how anxious to have the new
process because he knew obyrne so
well the man was wealthy in his
own right indifferent to fame to
everything but the deep need to cre-
ate which had driven him so hard for
so many years toward the completion
of his miracle miracle in three di-
mension it seemed like a dream
what he had just seen but behind it
lay the prospect for a fortune vaster
than any movie magnate had ever
dared to hope for to control this
was to control the whole world sil-
vers clenched his cigar tighter and
dreamed magnificent dreams

 anne acton lay on a low couch in
her lavish little dressing bungalow
staring up with conscious pathos
into the doctors face as silvers came
into the room somehow illogically
it was a shock to him to see her here
when he had so short a time before
miracle in three dimensions



left that perfect illusion of herself
in the enchanted wood outside ath-
ens asleep on the bank of wild
thyme

 how are you anne he de-
manded anxiously for she repre-
sented a fabulous sum to the com-
pany and an illness now in the midst
of her latest picture would be ruin-
ous is she all right doc when
did she come out of it

 while they were phoning you
abe said acton herself in a faint
pathetic voice moving her head un-
easily so that the great slipping rope
of silver-pale hair moved across the
brocade it-it was all so queer
suddenly i felt too tired to move as
if all the strength had drained right
out of me and i must have fainted
but i wasnt really out kept having
sort of dreams-i dont remember
now - woods somewhere and music
and suddenly it all ended and i
opened my eyes here im all right
now only i feel as weak as a kitten
look she held up an exquisite hand
to show it quivering

 what is it doc demanded sil-
vers anxiously

 um-m-m-overwork perhaps gen-
eral exhaustion-its impossible to
say definitely without further exam-
ination	
will she be okay now

 i see no reason why with rest
and care she shouldnt be

  ill send for your car anne said
silvers authoritatively youre going
home to bed ill see you later
philip graves in the braid-be-
decked finery of a movie caballero
was sitting up on his couch and
holding a cigarette in unsteady fin-
gers when silvers pushed through
the little knot of attendants that sur-
rounded him

 feeling better phil he de-
manded what was it

  nothing-nothing said the actor
impatiently im okay now just
passed out for a few minutes ill be
all right

  abe silvers lost n-o time in calling
a meeting of the board the twelve
members of metro-cosmic stood
about in twos and threes murmuring

  incredulously in the shadows of the
obyrne studio on the night when
the first dozen bar-platforms were
erected silvers had not dared to
describe fully this modern miracle

  its like nothing you ever saw be-
fore he warned them as rather
sheepishly they allowed themselves
to be herded forward to the plat-
forms when they were all at their
stations and silvers signaled obyrne
to begin he glanced once around the
little company before the lights
blazed on doubtfully they returned
his stare with a murmur or two of
protest rising

  feel so damn silly an official
said standing here mean to say there
isnt any screen what are we sup-
posed to look at

and then like a wall of brilliant
blindness the foggy light closed
down upon them and every man was
cut off from his fellows so that he
stood alone and disembodied in the
heart of that soft misty blaze star-
tled exclamations sounded through
the mist murmurs that died away as
silvers heard for the second time the
creamy smoothness of the announcers
voice rolling through the dimming
brightness

  you are now about to enter an en-
chanted wood outside athens on a
midsummer night to share in a
dream that shakespeare dreamed

  somehow as the play went on abe
silvers began to wonder a little un-
easily at the violence of the quarrel
between titania and oberon that
flamed almost tangibly through the
clear dim air had they fought be-
fore so fiercely had they-

a gibber of wild inhuman laughter
the long leap of puck over his shoul-
der broke the queer thought half-
formed just as a bell began to shrill
through the forest he knew a mo-
ment of unreality he remembered
that in the previous performance the
bell had not rung until titania lay
down to sleep on the bank where the
wild thyme grew but with shocking
completeness the forest vanished sil-
vers stared blankly around the stu-
dios reaches that had so suddenly


strange stories

replaced the glades of faeryland
blinking at the circle of dazed men
in amazement

 telephone for you abe
obyrnes voice called through the
fading mists of the dream that had
so strongly gripped him he grinned
sheepishly and stepped down from
the platform

  listen chief babbled a distressed
voice over the wire shrill above the
rising babble of delight behind sil-
vers actons out like a light at the
grove

  is she plastered

  i dont think so-but try to tell
the papers that she-wait-oh shes
just coming out of it whatll we
do

  send her home sighed silvers
ill get onto the papers right away
what a life

he turned back to obyrne with a
shrug actons passed out again
he murmured unhappily i wonder
if she-well if she folds now in the
middle of never tomorrow well
lose our shirts on it im going to
get a doctor to-

  abe said obyrne in a voice so
quiet that the other man turned to
him in surprise abe do you realize
that every time ve run this picture
anne acton faints i wonder if the
other actors feel the same reaction
why-what do you mean why
should they blair are you going
crazy

  silvers voice was stoutly confident
but despite himself an uneasy little
flicker woke in his mind philip
graves who played oberon had been
dazed and out of his head too that
other time and-yes hadnt he no-
ticed an item in a gossip column say-
ing that phoebe templeton had col-
lapsed at a tea in new york was
it the same day rather terrifyingly
he thought it was but of course all
this was the most flagrant nonsense
his job now was to keep acton out
of the papers she had not endeared
herself to reporters and he knew
they would make the story sound as
bad as possible they-the phone
rang again

  a wire from philip graves man
has just come in abe his wifes
voice told him worriedly philips
been taken terribly sick on shipboard
his man says it will be in all the
papers tomorrow and he wants your
advice

  silvers ran a hand distractedly
through his hair thanks he said
a little blankly ill take care of it
be home later

  he turned to the men still grouped
around the bar-platforms in their
babble of amazed delight they had
not heard his low-voiced conversa-
tions at the desk

  weve got this fellow under con-
tract havent we said someone anx-
iously at his elbow ought to get go-
ing on production right away this
is the most tremendous thing that
ever happened

  yes-hell let us have it silvers
told him abstractedly blair hows
the production on the first hundred
bar-platforms coming weve got to
give a larger showing right away
a hundred and fifty will be ready
in about a week obyrne admitted
reluctantly but abe-abe do you
think we ought to do it

  silvers pulled him aside look
blair he said gently you mustnt
let your imagination run away with
you what possible connection can
there be between the showing of this
picture and the fact that a few over-
worked nervous people have fainting
spells ill admit its a coincidence
but weve got to be sensible we
cant let the biggest thing that ever
happened in pictures slip through
our fingers just because some dizzy
actress passes out once or twice
obyrne shrugged a little i won-
der he murmured as if thinking
aloud how long people have been
trying to create life somethings
always prevented it-no ones been
allowed to succeed this thing of
mine isnt life but its too near it to
leave me at peace with myself i
think theres a penalty for usurping
the powers of godhead-for coming
too close to success im afraid abe
blair will you do me a favor
demanded silvers will you go to
miracle in three dimensions



bed and forget all about this until
morning ill see you tomorrow
right now im up to my neck in
trouble

 obyrne smiled ghostily all
right he said   

templeton-fredericks

elopement

  that was the headline the news-
boys were yelling when silvers
stepped out of his car the next day
he looked twice at the headline to be
sure for the romance of phoebe tem-
pleton not with bill fredericks but
with manfield drake had kept screen
magazines in ecstasies for the past
six months the wedding was to
have been this week but-he bought
a paper hastily a wild thought flash-
ing through his mind templeton
and fredericks had played the lovers
in obyrnes photoplay

  bill and i have known one another
for about six months phoebe tem-
pleton was quoted as saying but we
never realized until last night how
much we meant to each other it
happened rather miraculously i was
on my way west and bill was here
in hollywood and suddenly in den-
ver it came over me that i simply
must talk to him i phoned long dis-
tance and-well its all pretty hazy
to look back on but i chartered a
plane and met him in yuma and we
were married this morning of course
i feel badly about manfield but
really this was too big to fight
against weve known since ten
oclock last night that we were meant
for each other

  silvers tucked the paper under his
arm and bit down hard on his cigar
it was at ten last night that they had
watched hermia and lysander in
the actual breathing presences of
templeton and fredericks murmur-
ing passionate love under a high-
floating moon for a moment a fan-
tastic wonder crossed his mind i
must be going nuts he murmured to
himself

  a week later an audience of a hun-
dred and fifty people gathered for
the real preview of obyrnes mid-
summer nights dream the bar-

platforms had been set up in the big
studio that had seen the first running
of the miraculous illusion it was
crowded now with murmurous and
skeptical people-officers and direc-
tors of metro-cosmic a sprinkling of
wives silvers conquered an inex-
plicable uneasiness as he sought
obyrne in a corner near the con-
trols blair was sitting on a heavy
stool before the machine and the
face he turned to his friend was full
of a queer strained tension he said
his voice a thread of sound

  abe-ive had the maddest notion
that every time i show this the fig-
ures come back realer than before
into the scenes they play maybe
they dont always hold to the action
we photographed-maybe the plot
carries them on beyond what shake-
speare wrote-more violently than-

silvers fingers gripped the other
mans shoulders hard sharply he
shook him an absurd uneasiness
darkening his memory of that im-
pression of fiercer violence in the
quarrel between oberon and titania
the last time he saw the play even
as he said firmly

  snap out of it blair youve been
working too hard maybe someone
else could run the picture tonight-
you need rest

  obyrne looked up at him apathet-
ically his alarm gone suddenly flat

  no ill do it if youre really de-
termined to run the thing maybe id
better maybe i can control them
better than an assistant could after
all i created them   

  silvers looked down at him for a
moment in frowning silence then
he shrugged and turned toward the
last empty bar-platform where the
audience waited the beginning of the
show obyrne was dangerously over-
worked he told himself after this
was over he must go to a sanatorium
for a long rest his mind was crack-
ing   

  misty radiance closed down about
him veiling the hundred and fifty
from his vision there was a mo-
ment of murmurous wonder punctu-
ated by small half-frightened screams


strange stories

from a few of the women as each
spectator was shut off into a little
world of silence and solitude

  into the silvery mist that familiar
rich voice rolled smoothly for the
third time silvers saw the broad gray
glades of faeryland hedged with im-
memorial forest opening magically
up about him for the third time ti-
tania trailed her streaming wings
into the moonlight oberon strode
with a jingle of mail from among the
trees and they met in fury halfway
down the glade their feet pressing
the bending grass with elfin light-
ness but there was no lightness in
their anger that ancient quarrel
flared up in violence between them
and the breezes shivered with their
wrath

  again hermia and lysander came
half laughing half fearful into the
woods again helena sobbed deme-
trius name among the unanswering
trees puck flitted in goblin glee
about his business of enchantment
and titania lay down to sleep on the
spangled grass among the wild
thyme

this time no telephone bell broke
into the magic of the dream

  and again these were living people
who moved so tangibly before the
audience the wind of their passing
brushing them the sound of their
breathing in their ears when they
stood near going about their magic-
haunted ways as obliviously as if
the spectators were the phantoms not
they their loves and hates and
heartbreak were vividly real under
that incredibly real moon

  once or twice silvers thought
vaguely that here and there in the
action things happened not exactly
as he remembered them had titania
actually slapped oberons dark angry
face before she swept out of the
glade had hermia and lysander
kissed quite so lingeringly under
that deep-shadowed oak but as the
play went on silvers last all thought
of times that had gone before and
sank fathoms deep in the reality of
the scene before him

  puck lured the spell-bewildered

lovers into the fastnesses of the for-
est they went stumbling through
the fog quarreling blinded by mist
and magic and their own troubled
hearts swords flashed in the moon-
light lysander and demetrius were
fighting among the veiled trees puck
laughed shrill and high and inhu-
man and swept his brown arm down
and from lysander came a choked
gasp the clatter of a fallen sword

  demetrius bent fiercely above him
silvers watched the bright blood bub-
bling from his side saw the blade
drip darkly smelled the acrid sharp-
ness of that spreading stain the il-
lusion was marvelous lysanders
death was a miracle of artistry from
the first choked gasp of pain to the
last bubbling of blood in his throat
the last twist of handsome silk-
sheathed limbs lysanders death-

  something troubled silvers mem-
ory but before he could capture it a
womans voice cried hysterically
somewhere in the misty forest hes
dead - hes dead and suddenly
blankly the forest was gone from
about them and he was staring into
dazed half-dreaming faces where an
instant before faeryland had stretched
depth upon depth of moonlit dimness
where lysander had lain dying on
the moss somewhere in the crowd
a woman was sobbing hysterically

  hes dead i tell you lysanders
dead and he doesnt really die in the
play someones killed him that
was real blood-i smelled it oh
get me out of this awful place

  silvers brushed the fog of dream-
land from his eyes and was halfway
across the floor to the projection
machine before the scream had ended
for he remembered now that tug of
memory as lysander fell shake-
speares play was romance not trag-
edy lysander should not have died

  obyrne clung to his high stool
his fingers white-knuckled as he
stared into silvers eyes

  you see he said in a strained
monotone you see what mass hyp-
notism will do they couldnt help
it-poor things-they must be half
alive-wandering in the fog  

  blair silvers voice rang sharply
miracle in three dimensions



blair snap out of it what are you
raving about are you mad

  the staring eyes turned to his al-
most apathetically

 i was afraid said obyrne in
that whispering monotone as if he
spoke in a dream i was afraid to
run it before this many people-i
should have guessed what would hap-
pen when acton and graves and-
are you still harping on that co-
incidence demanded silvers in a
fierce undertone cant you see how-
foolish it is blair what earthly

african savages tibetan nomads
chinese peasants south american
indians even the ancient egyptians
highly civilized as they were delib-
erately made their drawings angular
and unlifelike all of them declared
and believed that too good a likeness
would draw the soul out into the
picture

such things-but youre not suggest-

startling stories

c at all stands

connection can there be between pic-
tures on a screen and living people
some of them half the world away
ill admit what happened tonight
was-

 did you ever hear- broke in
blair softly as if he were following
some private train of thought and
had not heeded a word of silvers
harangue-of savages covering their
faces when explorers bring out
their cameras they think a photo-
graph will steal their souls its an
idea so widespread that it cant have
originated in mere local superstition
tribes all over the world have it

and philip graves illness-yes after
what happened tonight how can you
deny it abe no the egyptians the
modern savages were closer to the
truth than we only before now no
likeness has been perfect enough to
absorb sufficient personality so that
people could notice it but these il-
lusions of mine-theyre real living
breathing while you watch you
cant believe the actual men and
women arent standing in front of
you

 it had an effect on acton and
graves when only you were watching
-enough of their personality was


strange stories

drained out of them into the illusion
by your own temporary conviction
that they were there so that they
went into vague dreams of woodland
and music i dont know how the
other actors were affected-i do
know that several of them were sick
and dizzy that day i havent checked
-maybe ive been afraid to   

  when the twelve board-members
were watching the drain was
stronger so that graves was really
ill on shipboard and acton couldnt
be roused from her faint until the
telephone call to you broke the illu-
sion here it affected templeton and
bill fredericks another way-hypno-
tized them into believing what the
audience was believing that they
were really in love-

recollection flooded into
silvers mind he remembered
what he had felt when he read the
headlines of the elopement he said
could it happen that way blair
how greatly could a mass mind affect
the reactions of the people it con-
centrates on i thought of it before
-if twelve individuals each con-
vinced for a time that he saw two
people desperately in love might
really work a sort of persuasion on
those two-no thats crazy it
couldnt happen

  you saw it happen murmured
blair quietly you saw what hap-
pened when a hundred and fifty peo-
ple joined in that fierce concentra-
tion-that utter conviction that they
saw a mans sword poised aimed de-
scending-mass hypnotism it was
for a majority of them that sword
really struck-their imagination out-
ran the actual fact and they thought
they saw lysander spitted on deme-
trius blade they thought they saw
him die

  well he didnt did he i mean
nothing happened this time or theyd
have called me

  a thin smile twisted up obyrnes
strained mouth he reached behind
him silvers heard a click and real-
ized that the telephone had been ly-
ing out of its cradle on the desk ever
since he reached blairs side

  i wanted you to understand be-
fore they broke the news to you
obyrne was explaining gently and
i knew the telephone would inter-
rupt me unless i-

  shrill buzzing whirred from the
desk with a little spurt of terror
for what he had yet to learn silvers
snatched it up a voice shouted
thinly in his ear

  silvers is that you chief my
god ive been trying to get you all
evening actons been in a coma for
over an hour-doctor cant rouse her
and a call just came in from london
that phil graves is out too-cant be
waked and-whats that what
chief words just come in that
templetons passed out too and bill
fredericks has dropped dead whats
the matter with this tovn its like
the end of the world-

  abe- obyrnes voice behind
him twisted silvers around like a
hand on his shoulder the receiver
shrilled unnoticed as their eyes met
obyrnes face was almost serene-
knowledge of what the telephone was
crying showed in his eyes he said
do you believe me now do you
understand do you realize how
much of life itself ive woven into
this damnable thing ive made yes
-its like two-dimensional pictures
that carry a shadow of the third-
enough dark to give a feeling of
depth in my three-dimensional pic-
ture ive somehow got a shadow of
the fourth-life maybe or some-
thing too near it maybe thats what
the fourth dimension is-life itself
but it wont kill men again-not
again

the crash of glass shattered into
the hysterical buzz of the crowd
silence like death fell over the con-
fusion of the murmurous throng
among the bar-platforms as they
turned white faces toward the corner
obyrnes frail arms swung his heavy
stool with desperate strength crunch-
ing and smashing and crashing among
the delicate intricacies of his pro-
jector silvers clutched the still
shrilling telephone and watched him
not moving
a question of

my limbs were lead my	that moved like sluggish quicksil-

heart was a great coiled	ver back and forth in burning waves

clock that throbbed rather	back and forth-consciousness and

lungs were metal sponges my head a	a background of slow dark pain

bronze bowl filled with molted lava	i felt just that nothing more i


strange stories

had a heart lungs body head-but
i felt nothing external that is my
body did not impinge on anything
i was not sitting or standing or
walking or lying or doing anything
that i could feel i was just heart
lungs body head alone in darkness
that was filled with the pulsing of a
muted agony this was myself

  but who was i

  the thought came the first real
thought for before that had been
only an awareness of being now i
wondered as to the nature of my
being who was i

  i was a man

  the word man aroused certain as-
sociations which struggled through
the pain through the thumping heart
and gasping lung sensation if i
was a man what was i doing where
was i

as if in response to the thought
awareness increased i had a
body and therefore i possessed hands
ears eyes i must try to feel hear see

  but i could not my arms were
lumps of immovable iron my ears
knew only the sound of silence and
the throbbing that came from within
my tortured body my eyes were
sealed by the leaden weight of enor-
mous eyelids this i knew and felt
panic

 what had happened what was
wrong with me why couldnt i feel
and hear and see

  i had been in an accident and i
was lying on a hospital bed under
ether that was one explanation
perhaps i had been crippled blinded
deafened maimed only my soul ex-
isted faintly like a whispering that
rustles through the ruins of an old
old house

  but what accident where had i
been before this i must have lived
what was my name

  i resigned myself to the darkness
as i strove to grapple with these
problems and the darkness was kind
my body and the darkness seemed to
be equally detached so that they min-
gled it was peaceful-too peaceful
for the thoughts that throbbed
through my brain the thoughts
fought and clamored and finally

scrcamed until i felt myself awaken

  it was the sensation i vaguely re-
called of finding ones foot asleep
it spread over my body so that a
pleasant tingling made me aware bit
by bit of having definite arms and
hands definite chest and pelvis defi-
nite legs and feet

  their outlines emerged and were
defined by that tingling a burring
droned in my spine as though a den-
tists drill had bit into it simulta-
neously i became aware that my
heart was a congo drum within my
chest my lungs great gourds swell-
ing and sinking in frantic rhythm i
exulted in the pain for through it i
felt myself that sensation of de-
tachment faded and i knew that i-
complete intact-lay against soft-
ness

  but where

  that was the next question and
sudden energy seemed ready to solve
it my eyes opened they encoun-
tered nothing but a continuation of
the blackness which lurks behind the
curtains of closed lids if anything
the blackness was deeper richer i
could see nothing of myself and yet
my eyes were open was i blind

  my ears still heard no sound other
than the mysterious inspiration of
my own breath

  my hands moved ever so slowly at
my sides rustling against cloth
which told me that my limbs were
clothed and yet unblanketed they
moved upward outward an inch
two inches three-and then they en-
countered hard unyielding surfaces
on either side they rose upward
prompted by fear six inches and
another unyielding surface of wood
my feet thrust out as i stretched
and through shoe-leather the tips of
my toes encountered wood my
mouth opened and a sound poured
forth it was only a rattle though
i had meant to scream

  for my thoughts whirled around
one name-one name that somehow
groped through a haze and loomed
as the symbol of my unreasoning
fear i knew a name and i wanted
to scream

  edgar allan poe

  and then my rattling voice whis-
a question of identity



pered unprompted that which i
so feared in connection with this
name

  the premature burial i whis-
pered poe wrote it i am-living
it

  i was in a coffin in a wooden cof-
fin with the hot stale air of my own
corruption reeking in my nostrils
burning in my lungs i was in a
coffin locked in earth and yet i was
alive

  then i found strength my hands
had been frantically scratching and
clawing at the surface above my
head now they gripped the sides of
my prison and thrust outward with
all strength my legs braced at the
foot of the box my legs then
kicked new vigor the vigor of
a madman rushed through my boil-
ing blood in sheer frenzy in an
agony born of the fact that i could
not scream and give expression to it
i lashed out with both feet at the
bottom of the coffin felt it splinter
and give way

  then the sides cracked my bleed-
ing fingers clutched at the earth be-
yond and i rolled over burrowing
and scrabbling at the moist soft-
packed earth i dug upwards wheez-
ing in a sort of mindless desperation
as i worked instinct alone combatted
the insane horror which gripped my
being and transformed it into the
activity which alone could save me

  they must have buried me in a
hurry the earth above my grave
was shallow choking and half suf-
focated i clawed my way to the top
after endless eons of utter delirium
during which the dust of the grave
covered me and i wriggled like a
worm through the dark ground my
hands reached up to form a cavity
then i lunged upward with full
strength and burst through to the
surface	

  i crawled out into silvery moon-
light flooding down upon a world of
marble toadstools which sprouted
richly from the mounds of grass all
about me some of the fantastic
stone growths were cross-shaped
others bore heads or great urnlike
mouths they were the headstones
of graves naturally but i saw only

toadstools-fat bloated toadstools of
dead-white pallor reaching unthink-
able roots into the ground below to
draw forth nourishment

  i lay staring at them staring back
at the pit through which i had come
up out of death into life once again
i did not could not think the
words edgar allan poe and pre-
mature burial had come unbidden
to my brain and now for some rea-
son i found myself whispering in a
hoarse dreadful voice then croon-
ing more loudly lazarus lazarus
lazarus

r a dually my panting sub-
sided and i drew fresh strength
from the air that sang through my
lungs i stared at the grave again-my
grave it bore no headstone it was a
poor grave in a poor section of the
cemetery probably a potters field
nearly on the outskirts of the ne-
cropolis it was and weeds writhed
over the poor graves there was no
headstones and it made me remem-
ber my question

  who was i it was a unique prob-
lem i had been someone before i
died but who surely this was a
novel case of amnesia to return to
a new life in the actual sense of the
phrase who was i

  funny i could think of words like
amnesia and yet could not in the
least associate them with anything
personal in my past my mind was
utterly blank did death do this
to me

 was it permanent or would my
mind awaken in a few hours just as
my body had if not i was in sore
straits i didnt know my name or
my station what i had been for
that matter on reflection i didnt
even know where i was the names
of cities flooded foolishly through
my brain chicago milwaukee los
angeles washington bombay
shanghai cleveland chichen itza
pernambuco angkor wat rome
omsk carthage i could not associ-
ate a single one with myself or for
that matter explain how i knew
those names

  i thought of streets of mariposa
boulevard and michigan avenue and


strange stories

broadway and center street and
park lane and the champs elysees
they meant nothing to me

  i thought of proper names felix
kennaston ben blue ralph waldo
emerson studs lonigan arthur
gordon pym james gordon bennett
samuel butler igor stravinsky-and
they represented no image of myself

  i could see all those streets visu-
alize all those people picture all
those cities but myself i could not
associate with any of them

  comedy tragedy drama it was a
mad scene to play in a cemetery at
nightfall i had crawled out of a
grave without a headstone and all i
know was that i was a man and
yet who

  my eyes roved over my person ly-
ing in the grass beneath mud and
dirt i saw a dark suit torn in places
and discolored it covered the body
of a tall man a thin body poorly
muscled and flat-chested my hands
rustling over my person were long
and leanly muscular they were not
the hands of a labourer of my face
i knew nothing though i passed my
hand over each feature in turn one
thing i felt certain of whatever the
cause of my apparent death i was
not physically maimed

strength prompted me to rise i
rose to my feet stumbled over
the grass for a few minutes i had
that drunken floating sensation but
gradually the ground became solid
under my feet i knew awareness of
the cool night wind on my forehead
heard with indescribable joy the
chirping of crickets from a swamp
afar i walked around the tombstones
gazed at the clouding sky felt dew
and dampness fall

  but my brain was aloof detached
wrestling with invisible demons of
doubt who was i what was i to
do i could not wander strange
streets in my disheveled condition
if i presented myself to authorities
i would be put away as a madman
besides i did not want to see any-
one this fact i realized quite sud-
denly

  i did not wish to see lights or
people i was-different

 it was the feeling of death was
i still-

  unable to bear the thought i fran-
tically groped for clues i tried
every means of awakening dormant
memories walking endlessly the
night through combatting chaos and
confusion fighting the gray clouds
that clung to my brain i wandered
up and down the deserted corner of
the cemetery

  exhausted i stared at a lightened
sky and then my thoughts fled
away even the confused ones i
knew only one thing-the need for
rest and peace and forgetfulness
was it the death-urge had i risen
from the grave only to return

 i neither knew nor cared actu-
ated by a compulsion as inexplicable
as it was overpowering i stumbled
toward the ruins of my grave and
crept inside burrowing like a mole
into the grateful darkness whilst the
earth tumbled in behind me there
was enough air the thought came to
enable me to breathe while i lay back
in the shattered coffin

 my head fell back and i settled
in my coffin to sleep   

 the muttering and rumbling died
away from dreams i could not re-
member they died away from
dreams and grew in reality until i
sat up pushing wet earth so that it
fell around me i was in the grave

 again terror somehow the hope
had lurked that this was a dream and
awakening might bring me to grate-
ful reality but i was in the grave
and a storm howled above i crawled
upward

  it was still night-or rather in-
stinct prompted me to believe that it
was night again i must have slept
the clock around this storm had
kept people from the graveyard kept
them from discovering the torn earth
and its inmate i rose to the surface
and the rain lashed me from skies
wild with anger

 and yet i was happy happy for
the life i knew i drank the rain
the thunder enraptured me as though
it were a symphony i marvelled at
the lightnings emerald beauty i
was alive

 all about me corpses rotted and
a question of identity



sloughed nor could all the fury of
the unleashed elements imbue them
with one spark of existence or of
memory my own poor thoughts my
own poor life were infinitely pre-
cious in comparison to the lot of
those below i had cheated worm and
maggot let the storm howl i would
howl with it share in the cosmic
jest

  vitalized in the truest sense of the
word i began to walk the rain
washed the earth-stains from my gar-
ments and body singularly i felt
no cold no especial dampness i
was aware of these things but they
did not seem to penetrate for the
first time i realized another odd
thing i was not hungry or thirsty
at least i did not seem to be had
appetite died with memory i won-
dered

  memory-the problem of identity
still pressed i walked along impelled
by the storm still pondering my feet
carried me past the confines of the
cemetery the gale leading me seemed
to guide my footsteps out onto the
stone sidewalk of a deserted street i
walked almost without heeding

  who was i how had i died how
revived

  i walked through the rain down
the dark street alone in the wet
velvet of the night

  who was i how had i died how
revived

  i crossed a block entered a nar-
rower street still stumbling alone
with the wind and the laugh of
thunder from clouds mocking my be-
wilderment

 who was-

  i knew my name-the street told
me summit street who lived on
summit street arthur derwin my-
self i was arthur derwin of sum-
mit street i used to be-something
i couldnt remember i had lived
lived for years and yet all i could
recall was my name

  how had i died

  i had been to the seance and the
lights were out and mrs price was
calling to someone she had screamed
something about evil influences and
then the lights had gone on

  they hadnt gone on

  but they must have

  they had but i wasnt there

  i had died died in the darkness
at the seance what killed me
shock perhaps and then what hap-
pened mrs price had hushed it up
i was alone in the city i had been
buried hurriedly in a paupers
grave heart failure the coroner
had probably called it i was laid
away that was it and yet i was
arthur derwin and surely somebody
had cared

  bramin street said the sign in the
lightning

  bramin street-someone had cared
-viola

  viola had been my fiancee she
had loved arthur derwin what was
her last name where had i met
her what did she look like

  bramin street

  again the sign unconsciously my
feet seemed to have led me down
this way i was valking down
bramin street without thinking in
the storm

  very well i would let my feet
lead the way i wouldnt think my
feet would take me to violas home
through habit there i would learn
no thinking now just walk through
the storm

 walked my eyes closed to the
blackness through which thunder
beat i walked out of death and i
was hungry now i was hungry and
thirsty here in the night and i was
hungry to see viola and thirsty for
her lips i had come back from
death for her - or was that too
poetic

  i came from the grave and went back
to sleep in it and rose again and sought
the world without memory it was
gruesome and grim and macabre i
died at a seance

  my feet plodded slopping through
rain i felt no cold no wet i was
warm inside warm with the memory
of viola her lips her hair she was
a blonde i remembered her hair was
coiled sunlight her eyes blue and deep
as the sea her skin the milky white-
ness of a unicorns flanks i had told
her so i recalled when i had held her
in my arms i knew her mouth as a


strange stories

scarlet gate to ecstasy she was the
hunger within me she the burning
beacon of desire that led me back
through mists of memory to her door

  i was panting and did not know it
within me revolved a wheel that had
once been my brain and was now just
a grinding round screen flashing
kaleidoscopic images of viola of the
grave of a seance and evil presences
and inexplicable death viola had
been interested in mysticism i had
been interested in the occult we
went to the seance mrs price was a
famous medium i died at the seance
and woke up in a grave i came back
to see viola i came back to find out
about myself i knew now what i was
how i had died but how revived

  but how revived bramin street
feet plodding

  and then instinct turned my feet up
the pathway to the porch it was in-
stinct which caused my hand to fumble
for the familiar door-knob without
knocking instinct which led me across
the threshold

i stood in a hallway a deserted
hallway there was a mirror there
and for the first time i could see my-
self perhaps that would shock me into
complete remembrance and recogni-
tion i looked but the mirror faded
before my gaze into a blur i felt
weak dazed but it was due to the
hunger within me the hunger which
burned it was late viola wouldnt be
downstairs she would be in her bed-
room at this hour

  i went up the stairs dripping water
at every step walking quite silently
aside from the little dripping patter of
rills running down to the stair below

  all at once giddiness left me again
and i felt strong i had the feeling
that i was ascending the stairs to des-
tiny  as though once i reached the top
i would know the truth of my fate

  something had brought me from the
grave here something lay behind this
mysterious resurrection- the answer
lay above

  i reached the top turned down the
dark familiar hall the bedroom door
opened beneath my hand a candle
burned at the bedside nothing more

  and i saw viola lying there she

slept incarnate beauty slept she was
very young and lovely at that moment
and i felt pity for her at what she
must know upon awakening i called
softly

  viola

  i called softly and while i did so
my brain said the last of the three
questions over and over

  and how revived said my brain

  viola called my voice

  she opened her eyes allowed life to
flood them she saw me

  arthur- she gasped youre
dead it was a scream that last

  yes i said softly

  why did i say yes i wondered
and my brain whispered and how
revived 

  she rose up shuddering youre
dead-a ghost we buried you mrs
price was afraid you died at the
seance go away arthur-youre
dead

  she moaned it over and over i
looked at her beauty and knew hunger
a thousand memories of that last eve-
ning came to me the seance and mrs
price warning of evil spirits the
coldness which had gripped me in the
darkness and my sudden sinking into
oblivion then this wakening and my
search for viola to appease my hun-
ger

  not for food not for drink not
for love a new hunger a new hun-
ger known only at night a new hun-
ger that made me shun men and forget
my former self a new hunger that
hated mirrors

  a hunger-for viola

  i moved toward her very slowly
and my wet grave-clothes rustled as
i reached out my hands reassuringly
and took her in my arms i was sorry
for her just for an instant then the
hunger came stronger and i bent my
head

  the last question rang in my brain
once again and how revived the
seance the threat of evil spirits an-
swered that question i answered it
myself

  i knew why i had risen from the
grave and who and what i was as i
took viola in my arms i took viola in
my arms and my teeth met in her
throat that answered the question

  i was a vampire

    t would be stupid of me to

must eventually set me free

   but there is a possibility that i may

 i must pen this account and

 be convinced

        must be convinced because

they must board up the pool and

strange stories

tinue to dream of that thing in the
swamp-the dark thing that took the
life of my friend martin aylethorp

 there was a time when i knew
peace thats the mockery my friend
martin had been in a slump period
-he wrote for a living-and i invited
him east for the sole reason that i
thought wed find a soothing tranquil-
lity at my home

  my cottage is near mill brook just
outside of concord martin i rea-
soned would enjoy tramping in prich-
ards woods and in the fall the new
england countryside takes on a mel-
low beauty most conducive to easing
shattered nerves

as i recall my preparation for his
coming it seems like a grim joke
i was so careful in rigging up his room
to insure its quiet-i even sent into
town for a noiseless portable to re-
place my regular typewriter

  for when martin arrived in late au-
gust he was a sick man his tall nor-
mally lean figure was now emaciated
his eyes were sunken behind his spec-
tacles and the smile i had remembered
as habitual upon his countenance
seemed drowned by inward melan-
choly he smoked too much and when
he held a cigarette the gray spirals
rose from the tip unevenly because of
the trembling of his hand

  i did my best to conceal my con-
cern over his changed appearance he
had been working on a novel and try-
ing to hold down a librarians job dur-
ing the day i gathered that he was
completely done in and had lately
found is impossible to continue with
his short story work it is amazing
what creative effort can do to a man
of martins peculiar temperament he
was drained dry-sucked of all vitality
as though his nights had been given
over to visits from a vampire or suc-
cubus rather than writing

  it isnt a bad comparison for martin
aylethorp wrote weird fiction he
wrote it intensely and it was his
theory not mine that writing fantasy
took more out of an author than work
in any other field his own person
certainly seemed to be good proof of
this contention

  i did my best for him i carefully

avoided all topics of conversation
which might relate to his work i did
not show him any of my recent stuff
i locked away all my reference books
and magazines and i did not allow
him to speak of his book

  i coaxed him into resting argued
and bullied him with the notion of
getting outdoor exercise interspersed
with plenty of sleep after a week or
so i gradually augented the menu at
meal time and encouraged him to eat

  it worked by the time september
had passed he had regained his nor-
mal attitude and his health was once
more back to par incidentally i my-
self had gained six pounds

  soon i proposed a series of daily
hikes in and about the local woods
martin took to the idea and for the
first time i learned that as a boy he
had often spent the summer with rela-
tives in concord he seemed eager as
his health improved to re-visit famil-
iar landmarks although i had been at
my cottage for over a year i was
amazed at the unsuspected secrets of
the countryside he uncovered soon
he was acting as my guide and i played
the meekly following visitor to local
shrines

  as his physical well-being increased
his normal interests were correspond-
ingly re-aroused within several weeks
he was talking stories and plots to me
again and by the end of the month he
was literally champing at the bit
eager to get back into harness and do
a few tales although i held out as
long as i could he insisted that he be
allowed the use of my typewriter and
our daily jaunts were now filled with
his talk of proposed work and plans
for stories

  and then our hikes and his interest
converged-disastrously

  one morning after breakfast he
came into my room and yanked me
out of my chair

  come on he urged the suns
high and were going for a little ex-
ploring jaunt

  where to i asked havent we
covered all the local show-places yet

  this is no show-place he replied
smiling its a secret ill wager
theres a spot youve never seen and
only a mile away from here too
the bottomless pool



  i doubt that i said what kind
of place is it

  martin assumed a look of melodra-
matic grimness

  its called the bottomless pool
he whispered

  whats the gag

  im serious its in the swamp
south of prichards woods i remem-
ber my gang explored it during one of
the summers i stayed here as a kid
its a strange place-george graves
warned us to stay away from it when
we told him wed been there he was
the only grown-up we ever spoke to
about it and it was he who called the
place the bottomless pool

 he mentioned walden pond in
concord-the place where thoreau
wrote his nature studies you know-
and said that it was bottomless too it
lies in a hollow in the hills has nei-
ther inlet nor outlet yet the water is
always fresh springs and a subter-
ranean river cause that no doubt the
glacier created some queer freaks
hereabouts but he said that govern-
ment engineers once came to walden
to take soundings and there were
spots in that pond that were deeper
than their longest sounding-wires
thats what he meant by a bottomless
pool and he said that the one in
prichards woods was similar

  well his warning just whetted our
interest in the spot you see kids are
like that i guess we got together all
the fishline the gang could lay their
hands on and tied it all together with
a lead weight on one end then we
lowered it down into that sluggish
black pool in the swamp

  we never struck bottom well
that sort of scared us-its a creepy
place-and we took the warning more
seriously

  i never have gone back that was
my last summer at concord-and i
gradually lost track of the boys but
i did hear something in a letter once
about sam dewey disappearing in the
swamp the following year sam was
the lad who suggested we take sound-
ings of course i dont think his dis-
appearance had anything to do with
his interest in the bottomless pool
although it might have at that he

was foolhardy and george graves
when warning us hinted something
about people who had fallen in

  i listened to all this with a sort of
tepid interest but martin seemed
genuinely enthusiastic

  lets go take a look at the place
he urged its really a weird spot
and ive got a hutlch theres a story
there somewhere

  i rose and obediently put on my
boots in my own solitary wanderings
i had avoided the mucky wooded
depths of the old swamp and it was
only to humor my guest that i acceded
to his request we struck out to the
south and soon reached the swamp
edge

tie swamp was awful the limbs
of dead trees interred the sun-
light and only the wan ghosts of its
beams haunted the murky avenues of
the morass rotten logs and slimy
creepers covered a slough of quick-
sand and bog through which i floun-
dered at martins heels the instincts
of boyhood guided him aright so that
he avoided the gray bubbling patches
of deeper ooze he remarked over
this voicing his amazement that after
all these years the place seemed to be
unchanged

  at first it was the physical difficul-
ties we encountered which impressed
me gradually however as we waded
deeper into the dark swamp i became
more aware of other less tangible
things the place looked like death
and smelled of deaths rottenness and
decay moss and fungoid growths
clung to the gray tree-trunks bloated
toadstools reared pulpy deaths heads
on fat stemmed necks rising from the
ooze

  the bubbling of the swamp-juices
beneath our boots was a silent kind of
sound or rather a noise that seemed to
intensify the silence and at the same
time to be a part of it there was no
wind in the hanging branches and we
saw neither bird nor animal in these
depths

  still there had been life here once
for we soon struck a rickety old fence
which wound in a seemingly haphaz-
ard manner through the lower swamp


strange stories

martin beckoning to me turned and
followed the meandering wooden out-
lines until he came to the willow tree
that bent over the ground before it
and there in the deep dark shade of
the ancient boughs lay the bottomless
pool

  it was small-barely six feet across
-and black jet black water motion-
less the pool was like a large un-
blinking eye with an odious green
scum filming its pupil

  thats a highly fantastic comparison
-but something about the pools ap-
pearance inspired such thoughts in me
it was strange and somehow unnatu-
ral it wasnt right for this small pool
to be here in the swamp and certainly
the thing looked as evil as any natural
formation ive ever seen

martin stood looking into the
depths for a few moments the
waters black too he murmured
-strange how in the presence of si-
lence the human voice is always
hushed the waters black as ink he
said and he dipped one hand into the
pool brushing off the scummy froth
and cupping ebon drops for me to see
the water was black and the decayed
matter in it gave it a veined appear-
ance  it was striated with dark green
rills

  place eery enough for you asked
martin i nodded

  scared us when we were kids he
observed and i wouldnt be too sure
of my reactions now but what a set-
ting for a story

  perhaps i had been staring into
the silent water and now i wondered
what was generating the impulse in me
to turn and run away

  were my own nerves bad i hastily
averted my gaze

  look martin shouted he really
spoke in a normal tone of voice but in
contrast to our previous hushed mur-
murs it was a shout

  look at the lizard he exclaimed
sure enough the surface of the black
water had parted with a widening rip-
ple and a small dark lizard of some
sort appeared it floated on its back
as though dead i reached down and
grabbed it yanked it out

  why theres a wire attached to it
i gasped the wire led down into the
water

  just then there came a pull on the
line from within the pool it yanked
the little dead reptile right out of
my hands but something attached
to it caught in my coat cut right
through it and dug painfully into
my side a hook

  im caught i cried as i stepped
toward the pdtol to ease the pain of the
barb in my side but now the wire line
had tightened was drawing me in
short jerks toward the brink of the
black pool i grabbed the line with
both hands braced my feet at the very
edge and leaned backward but the
sod on which i was standing crumbled
and i slid feet foremost into the sty-
gian water

  help i cried

  martin leaped forward and grabbed
me with a tremendous tug he hurled
me back on the bank water coursed
down my body and warm blood
scalded the deep wound in my side i
felt faint

  martin swore softly as he daubed
iodine on the cut beneath my shirt and
i swore loudly at the pain neither of
us were ready to comment but sud-
denly martin turned his head and
darted again to the edge of the pool
he pointed speechless

  another lizard larger than the first
now rose to the surface of the pool it
bobbed and seemed to beckon

  martin scowled deeply pointed to
my hook-gashed side and growled out
a single word

  bait

  bait what bait the lizard i
snorted disgustedly

  but ah the way home we marveled
at the incident we argued as i
changed into dry garments debated
as i bandaged my side mused during
luncheon and speculated wildly all
the long afternoon

  martin ever the imaginative had a
dozen fantastic theories

  who fished at the depths of the bot-
tomless pool and with hooks some-
thing lived in the pool maybe some-
things the somethings fished for
men as a boy hadnt george graves
the bottomless pool



hinted about disappearances and
hadnt sam dewey vanished near the
swamp

something in the pool set traps
for men-putting lizards on
hooks and using a wire line the bot-
tomless pool led to inner earth and
there was life below thus martin
expressed himself half-seriously

  to which i offered the obvious re-
plies the hook and line had been
used by some fisherman it had fallen
into the water perhaps the lizard had
been accidentally impaled upon the
hook risen to the surface as it died
and brought the line up i grabbed it
got hooked and a snag entangling the
lines end under water had pulled me
into the pool

  but what about the second lizard
we saw martin insinuated gently

  i was silent

  martin was grave for a moment be-
fore continuing i remember as a
boy fishing for pickerel up assabet
the boat rocked i was only about nine
at the time but i was a smart fisher-
man i hooked a big pickerel that day
-and the pickerel hooked me

 i gave him an uncomprehending
glance how i asked

  line got wrapped around my foot
and the fish pulled me out of the
boat he laughed then in graver
tones he went on if i were a fish
and i wanted to catch a fisherman id
tangle him up in a line take the bot-
tomless pool for example if i meant
to capture whoever or whatever is fish-
ing for me from below id grab that
lizard bait and allow it to drag me in
toward the pool then id pull up
more line and attach the wire to a
windlass rope and then id let go of
the hook the sudden release might
precipitate the fisherman below over-
board into the water and tangle him
up then by quickly winding in the
windlass id haul the fellow up to the
surface

  but thats absurd i began theres
no fisherman in the bottomless pool-
there cant be and besides-

  how does your hooked side feel
this evening interjected martin sar-
castically

  oh lets forget it i grumbled

  but i didnt forget i dreamed that
night and martin did not forget
either he spent the midnight hours
at the typewriter taking notes for a
story neither of us however spoke
again of the bottomless pool

  the next day i awoke with a slight
fever the wound in my side was a
little inflamed and i lay abed bath-
ing it with hot cloths to reduce the
swelling martin after assuring him-
self that i was not utterly helpless
announced that he was going for a
walk

  id like to interview a few old-
timers around here about that place
he told me there should be myths

  i forget what remark i made but i
know that i tried to laugh him out of
his interest secretly i was very much
disturbed my dreams had not been
pleasant and the bottomless pool had
figured rather too prominently in
them for a moment i had the wild
notion that martin was going off to
try out his fishing theory he seemed
almost unnaturally interested a per-
son of his temperament can be greatly
influenced by imaginative concepts

  he left on his purported mission of
investigation and i spent a long day
in dozing and dreaming it was late
afternoon when he returned greeted
me brusquely and went in to the other
room in a few moments i heard the
vibration of the noiseless typewriter

  rising i got supper together we
ate but little fever had banished my
own appetite and excitement seemed
to grip martin so that food could not
interest him

 almost as soon as he sat down he
launched into a long babble of gossip
he had picked up during the day old
bert pickens down near the cause-
way had known martins parents he
had filled my friend up with old
colonial tales and even some indian
lore hed heard as a boy back in the
seventies

  there were stories about the swamp
south of the woods specific cases of
disappearances dating way back as far
as community memory went

 visiting granny mercers cottage
later in the day martin had persuaded
the always garrulous old woman to re-


strange stories

count her own family history it was
a point of pride with the crone that
her pure blood had at one time pro-
duced a martyr during the salem
witchcraft hysteria and she warned
martin most gravely about the old
pool it was from her that he picked
up his tale of the indian rites in the
swamp where the braves sometimes
offered up sacrifices to the pit-god
they believed dwelt in the pool-cast-
ing bodies into the orifice

 i could see that martin was more
impressed with this lore than even he
admitted he was very glib in patching
together his yarn so that it formed an
almost recognizable story sequence
he quoted from memory the words of
cotton mather concerning gateways
to hell and openings in earth which
lead to the regions of the damned
indeed he weaved a fine romance
about the pool and did it so deftly
that i was forced to the conclusion
that he half-believed some of it

  ill write it all up tonight he told
me then i must have another look
at the place you know theres some-
thing fascinating about all this-its a
real mystery wouldnt it be remark-
able if there is some truth about my
theories concerning the fishing after
all those lizards dont manufacture
hook and wire and some of these old
wives tales are very definite

 i made no comment i went to bed
early leaving martin to type away in
the next room as he had planned my
sleep was troubled and it must have
been about midnight when i woke in a
cold sweat and stumbled into the
kitchen for water the house was
dark and still i passed through mar-
tins room and noticed with a start
that his bed was empty

  fever left me i knew with an in-
explicable dread that martin had
gone and i knew too where he had
gone

 my first thought was that i had
over-estimated his recovery he might
still be mentally ill the pool in the
swamp had exercised a morbid fasci-
nation on his mind poor judgment
might have led him to see the thing
by moonlight for the sake of captur-
ing story atmosphere

  i went back to bed but i did not
sleep i kept waiting for him to re-
turn the night was long i trem-
bled with fever and with secret fear
it was not a good thing to wander
alone in the swamp by night quick-
sand and fog to say nothing of the
possibilities of running into some
prowler made the stunt dangerous

  but after an hour had passed i
found that it was not this spectacle
of actual apparent dangers which dis-
turbed me i began to think only of
the pool itself and of the bait upon
its black surface

  then it was that unreasoning panic
gripped me i rose and bundled up
tugged on my boots i snatched up
my belt flashlight and ran out

i swear i had no sense of time
passing on my nocturnal trek in
the woods it seemed only a fever-
filled instant before i was already
wading into that black jungle fring-
ing the swamp only a mist-wrapped
moment before i darted from hum-
mock to hummock in the rising fog
calling martins name only the frogs
croaked an answer

  then i was following the fence-rail
and finally grasped the willow trunk
as i stared down at the bank of the
pool-the bank of wet mud in which
were implanted the fresh boot-prints
of human feet they faced one way
only-toward the pool and as they
neared the edge they slurred into a
sort of sliding scooped-out impres-
sion as though the wearer had been
dragged   

  dragged into the black silent water
from which the tiny bubbles now
arose slowly slowly   

  i screamed and ran back into the
night

  fever held me the next day but i
was glad for it kept me from think-
ing too much-thinking about what
had happened and also about what i
planned to do

  i didnt consider the possibility of
suicide-not when i read the typed
notes martin had written the night be-
fore the whole story of his belief
lay there and there were incredible
hints of what he expected to bring
the bottomless pool



forth from the pool depths at the
last he spoke of the urge to re-visit
the scene and capture a lizard for ex-
amination-to see if it were of a rec-
ognizable species and also to deter-
mine just how it had been killed he
wanted some wire also and one of
the hooks then he would go ahead
and try his plan

  for he quite definitely had intended
to use the windlass trick i learned
that before the morning was over-the
delivery truck brought the order from
the city

  i went sick as i signed martins
name for the shipment i had a sud-
den vision of him on the night be-
fore standing by the pool as he waited
for the appearance of the bait then
stooping to remove the reptile and
being caught dragged   

  no it was not suicide it was mur-
der

  but by what means

  through burning delirium came the
answer-pictures conjured up from
indian legends and witchcraft whis-
perings a dweller beneath the
waters fishing for humankind and
snaring the curious a fissure in the
earths crust leading to some hellish
subterranean cavern and martin go-
ing down down into the inky waters
on the end of a hook to be seized by-
what 

  i wrould find out the windlass and
martins scheme-he would be avenged
with his own plan his own instru-
ment

  i must have been a little mad i
talked and laughed to myself a great
deal as the day sped i gathered
the equipment together at dusk and
started for the swamp an unhealthy
night-fog was already rising when i
left prichards woods but though
fever coursed through my veins i
plodded on i walked through night-
mare

  the unseen frogs croaked a dismal
litany as i stumbled through the bog
tapers of fog rose dimly on all sides
and smoky mist hung about my head
i floundered through the gray dark-
ness lugging the windlass often i
sank ankle-deep into puddles of bub-
bling slime	 -v -

  all about me in the night was rot-
tenness and decay and death and i re-
call thinking that this putrescent
swamp was but a frame a background
a setting for the black jewel of the
bottomless pit but the fog and the
fever in my temples accounted for
such wild fancies

  fog and fever conspired toward my
feeling of unutterable loathing when
first i caught sight of the ebon waters
upon the inky chasm in the center of
the swamp

  fog and fever addled me so that i
monotonously cursed as i anchored
the windlass to a big log set upon
the firm higher ground of the bank
a short rope from the drum of the
windlass ran to the edge of the pool
and ended in a quick-settling clamp
there was a detached part of me
that carried out these operations with
methodical precision and yet another
part that inspired my cursings as i
crouched there in the forest darkness
of the heaving breathing swamp

beneath my feet the quicksand
thrummed and groaned and i re-
call that a wild picture rose in my
mind i had a fantastic image of my-
self crouching upon the epidermis of
some gigantic monster-as though the
swamp itself were just the skin of a
vast beast and the bottomless black
pit a tiny pin-prick in the flesh but
that too was fog and fever

  the preparations were made i had
not even glanced at the scummy sur-
face of the pool so sure was i of what
my eyes must encounter now with
the drum ready for use and the wind-
lass securely placed i gazed into the
dark depths and jerked on the flash-
light i wore at my belt

  its rays disclosed the floating blue
body of a tiny lizard bobbing monoto-
nously upon the surface of the cryptic
waters there it lay in death rising
and sinking upon water that did not
move and that fact inspired me with
the terrible fear of a corroboration
for poor martins story

  i stared at the creature fighting the
fog and fever that created gray mist
upon my brain until the only thought
distinguishable was a panic impulse to


strange stories

flee the spot i rocked on my heels
when i wished to run screaming back
across the bog to a spot where nature
is sane and friendly

  and then i felt in my pocket for the
wire-clipper i had found on martins
desk for some absurd reason the
cold feel of the prosaic factory-cut
metal reassured me and with my
free hand i reached out and snatched
at the blue lizard

  i tugged the body from the water
in the beam of the flashlight on the
bank-and the clear yellow beam was
cut by a black line the lizard was
wired seizing the clamp next to me
i quickly clipped the wire to the
windlass rope

  then i yanked on the wire with
both hands i tugged a shudder
ran through me for i felt a dreadful
unmistakable response from the other
end of the line through the water
it tightened jerked

i

someone below was pulling on
the rope someone was fishing

but who and from how far below

  the tugger was strong in sudden
desperation i felt my heels slide along
the bank powerful jerks were draw-
ing me close to the black brink of that
dark still pool with a gasp i let go

  the line whipped back into the
water in my minds eye i formed a
silly senseless picture of a fisherman
standing on his wharf then falling
over backwards as the catch released
his line an idiotic picture it was
for there could be no fisherman at the
bottom of a bottomless pool or could
there be

  i would soon know the line fell
back then reached the spot where i
had clamped it to the windlass rope
there it snapped-taut

  the fisherman had fallen overboard
he had been hooked i laughed with-
out mirth at the insane thought

  and then i gripped the windlass
handle and turned the drum and i
felt a terrific threshing tauten the line
until it stood straight in the flash-
lights beam again the wire began
to snap back and forth in the black
waters of the pool i turned and
turned a hundred a thousand revolu-

tions were made in augmenting frenzy
-for now i desperately realized that
each crank was bringing me closer and
closer to the secret of the bottomless
pool

  suddenly the winch jammed i
stared in dismay then saw that the
drum was full then i leapt in front
of the windlass and grabbed the re-
maining wire in my hands

  it took a second but i experienced
a year through fever and fog came
images of what i might expect to find
at the end of my line martins
bloated corpse blue and swollen with
the line gripped between death-
clenched teeth    the shapeless body
of a child long mired in the slime of
the pit    sea-monster   

  but no it could not be there was
a fisher down there-a fisher that
baited cunningly this hook and sent a
wire line upwards to entrap children
and wanderers and curious men and
the fisher had taken martin and was
now entangled in this line a fisher
in a black and bottomless pool i was
drawing in a fisher from below

  the rays of the flashlight on the
bank now gleamed upon the surface
of the scummy waters but they were
still no longer in oozing eddies they
bubbled and swirled and black slime
was tossed upwards as i drew th cut-
ting wire through my hands a ter-
rific force was pulling against me and
fright alone conspired to intensify the
strength of my grip at that moment
i would gladly have released my hold
but sheer hysteria made my muscles
rigid slowly inexorably i drew the
final length of the wire from the water
in the yellow light

  the fisher emerged   

  i cannot remember if i screamed
aloud but there was the sound made
by utter fear ringing and crashing
against my brain for i saw the crea-
ture of the pit-saw the strangled
neck about which the tangling wire
had wound and allowed me to pull
the fisher upwards i saw what filled
the six-foot surface of the pool as it
emerged

  it was a head shaped by horrors
dreams alone not human not rep-
tilian not frog-like-it was neverthe-
the bottomless pool



less featured with great staring yellow
eyes snouted like a saurian and cov-
ered with a greenish batrachoid skin
that glistened slickly against the yel-
low light

  the monstrous bulging eyes rolled
wildly and dilated in agony as the
creature opened its great slitted
mouth in a soundless choking gasp
i stared into a red maw that was
fanged in a manner unknown to any
beast still roaming earth-and as i did
so a sickening realization swept over
me this was the fisher

  an instant only did that gigantic
glistening head rise greenly above the
waters of the pool-then my clippers
were out the wire snapped with a
shrill twang and the fisher from be-
low sank beneath the bubbling black
waves with a thunderous splash of
slime i stared down blankly into the
depths as the waters quickly became
quiescent once again i could see
nothing-but i did not wish to

  i did not wish to learn what man-
ner of horrid life flourished unnatu-
rally at the bottom of this opening-
wherever that bottom might be i
did not care to speculate upon the cun-
ning intelligence of a primal entity
which even now fished for men from
its lair in the black deep i did not
think i could endure surmises which
now clamored for consideration

  was this the only creature of its
kind or were there more down there 
what inversion of sane natural laws
allowed existence in nighted depths
and what manner of ghastly intelli-
gence prompted prehistoric beasts to
set bait for men were there other
such openings in the earths conceal-
ing crust through which the madness
below had access to humanity

  but what i most devoutly tried to
keep from thinking about was the
scraped sides of the pool-bank and
the reasons for it only the head of
the monster had emerged and it had
filled the pool the sides were
scraped by the shoulders-and the six-
foot pool had not been wide enough to
permit the passage of the body

  fog and fever were merciful re-
leases i know that i dumped the
windlass in the pool and it sank like

a plummet and i dimly remember
running back through the swamp

i was ill the next few days and
then the police came and i told
them what i dared they have seen
the pool but they have said nothing
of their opinion to me i told them
more today and will tell them all i
know soon-not to preserve my free-
dom but because now i want the spot
boarded up it must be lest others
see the bait it must be boarded up
for it cannot be filled up

  i shall tell them soon or let them
read this they can think me de-
mented if they like but i trust they
believe enough to act and act
promptly perhaps if even then they
do not believe i may show them the
hook i have-the hook from the wire
in the pool which i cut off i hate to
reveal it to them for i detest the
very memory of the thing myself

  it is made of some golden metal
harder than pure gold it is cut and
rudely shaped-and i dislike to con-
ceive of the creatures who deliber-
ately formed it for its horrid purpose
and made the wire to which it was
attached i cannot bear to think of
the civilization behind such a creative
effort and worst of all is the memory
of those designs in the metal

  those designs created by what
primal artist there are three of
them cut into the gold surface they
tell all so that i know only too well
why the fishers seek men with bait
from their bottomless pits

  the first design is tiny like the rest
but it unmistakably depicts a creature
such as the one whose head i saw i
dare not describe the body which is
shown here but the creature is bait-
ing a hook   

  the second little design is a crude
representation of a man falling
through water at the end of a line as
martin must have fallen

  and the third design-but i must
not speak of that-tells of what mar-
tins fate was tells why the fishers
fish that third hellish design on the
hook

  it shows a feast   

 the bottomless pool must be
boarded up
fulfillment

out of the piled-up
centuries comes an
inexorable summons
for the twin of
isames

by will garth

author of murder in the wax works
king of voodoo etc

it was not a dream despite the
fact that she had distinctly re-
membered going to bed as a last
conscious effort after the stormy in-
terview with artemus russo mar-
jorie westbrook knew as she had
known about other weird instances in
her life that this was stark and cold
reality

  there was no state of transition
between the pleasant business of re-
tiring and this instinct awareness of
an incredible situation simply she
had gone to bed in her lovely cham-
ber at home in forest hills as mar-
jorie westbrook heiress to the
westbrook motor millions her mind
filled with business details over the
present policies of the late george
westbrooks automobile factories

  and here she was wide awake and
standing before an altar in front of
her an altar of ancient egyptian
motif with the sacred ibis projecting
in relief at the ends like figureheads
of ships

  she stood in her bare feet upon a
cold floor of tesselated marble more-
over the satin nightdress the last
item of dress she remembered don-
ning was gone she stood there in
complete nudity but she was con-
scious of no sense of shame or mod-
esty

  without seeing it for she was
powerless to turn-she was aware of
an immensity of space which ex-

the crystal ball turned inky black

 tended in all directions behind her
 a space blocked out with intangible
 green mist that was almost black and
 almost of the density of velvet
 drapes

  at her right hand was an upright
sarcophagus with the lid removed
within the musty and spicily pun-
gent interior was the wrapped figure
of a mummy-a mummy which
queerly enough was headless

  it was all like closing her eyes
upon a scene in a cinema for an in-
stant to open them upon a sudden
change of locale with this signifi-
fulfillment



 cant difference there was no con-
 tinuity no relevance no congruity
 no connection between her life and
 this grotesque pattern

  none there were of course her
previous experiences-those strange
uncanny interludes in her otherwise
prosaic life but there was no tangi-
ble connection unless you considered
the sarcophagus-which looked ex-
actly like the one she had purchased
some months before even to the
headless mummy in the musty in-
terior

  somehow and marjorie could not
explain it that sarcophagus which
should have been in her boudoir was
here with her in this other world
that egyptian sarcophagus-as soon
as she had seen it she had been re-
solved to possess it its fascination
for her had been but the apex of an
amazing sequence of bizarre oc-
currences and it blended as a
perfect complement with those ex-
periences   

  marjorie now became aware that
just beyond the altar before which
she stood was the figure of a man
in a cowled crimson robe his hands
busy at a set of dials and buttons
before him and the craziest and
most outre part of it all was the
monks face he was artemus russo
general manager of westbrook mo-
tors yet there was a strangeness
about him that was not russo

  before she had time to cry out to
question him to demand an explana-
tion marjorie noticed the light she
was outlined in a glow of light like
a psychic aura of unbelievable in-
tensity shading from pure white to
garish green mantling her in a bath
of living light as she stared down
at her lovely form to her horror
she saw the flesh become translucent
transparent and finally invisible-
and the skeletal structure of her
body from neck to toe became hide-
ously revealed in glowing pink

  still bound by invisible chains
which kept her motionless but with-
out pain marjorie heard the cowled
figure speak and the tones of his
voice awakened a thousand memories
in her mind memories which were
not of the well-tailored artemus

russo who shouted so irately about
proxies and assets and common stock
of westbrook motors inc

  the hour has come princess he
said to fulfill your destiny

  ankhtares she gasped giving
him a name which came easily from
her lips no no i am not
ready j

  her own answer startled her pro-
foundly shook her to the depths of
her soul

  that was what made these bizarre
occurrences in her life so distressing
it implied knowledge on her part of
monstrous things from the womb of
time about which she as marjorie
westbrook should have known noth-
ing but she did know even now
answering so easily to the title of
princess yet aware of herself as
marjorie westbrook she remem-
bered similar experiences

the first had happened when she
was a child of ten without warn-
ing she had passed from a safely
mundane world to a shadowy temple
of vast halls and towering pillars
going to bed all tired out from a
day of happy play-falling quickly
asleep-suddenly she was standing
before a high altar whose sides were
a frieze of jackal-headed dolls of
angular lines or were they dolls
how was a little girl of ten to know

  yet they were not strange to her
without knowing how she knew she
was as familiar with the symbol of
anubis as she was with her own sis-
ter the twin who had always walked
beside her sister with a start
she realized that another little girl
was standing with her before that
forbidding altar with its plume of
curling incense the little companion
was an exact duplicate of herself
dressed in archaic headdress and
queerly draped robe of costly silk
with beaten gold design in the hem
on her ankles and arms bracelets
glittered one in the form of a coiled
serpent with eyes of emerald green

  this was isames without being
told marjorie knew that her own
name was isira it had always been
isira-for ten years of egyptian
childhood as a princess of the royal


strange stories

blood there was no marjorie west-
brook in this consciousness and yet
she knew she was marjorie west-
brook and that sir gerwain was wait-
ing for her out in her fathers ken-
nels in a way it was terrifying and
marjorie isira whimpered

  be brave isira whispered isa-
mes it is our heritage

  before marjorie could reply there
was movement behind the altar and
ankhtares high priest of ammon a
cold and stern man with the features
of artemus russo her fathers secre-
tary swam into view there was a
strange light in his piercing black
eyes as he looked out and down upon
the two little girls who stood before
the altar to the dead tightly clasp-
ing each others hands

  princess isira and princess isa-
mes he spoke in a sonorous voice
which echoed hollowly through the
great hall of the temple in accord-
ance with the rule of your house
blessed under the sign of the crux
ansata and dedicated to the service
of ra you are here to choose your
destiny are you prepared

 we are prepared o ankhtares
marjorie heard herself and her sister
reply that the language was not
modern english she did not even
note

 the high priest passed his hand
above the curling incense rising from
the altar in a cabalistic sign and
blue smoke fairly boiled up in writh-
ing convolutions that had sparks of
incandescent red the figure of the
high priest was obscured for a mo-
ment and both little girls trembled
then he came back into view

  in this the third era in the sec-
ond dynasty of ptolemy his com-

for the other there is a timeless void
until her spirit shall find life and
happiness in a future existence and
then she shall grow old before her

time and in the end the twain shall
be reunited by a bond far stronger
than that of natal ties it is so writ-
ten choose well ye little princesses
behold the sacred ibis awaits to
carry the word to ammon giver of
all

  both little girls clung together and
quivered in wide-eyed fright as they
saw the blue smoke take the form
of the sacred bird the words of
the high priest were incomprehen-
sible to them but they stared at the
shadowy bird of ra and spoke
bravely

  i want to be a queen said isa-
mes

  i want to be happy said isira

 with a puff of smoke the nebu-
lous ibis disappeared

  so be it said the voice of ankh-
tares

  there was a flash of blinding light
and little marjorie westbrook opened
her eyes to find the norning sun
streaming in at the window and to
hear the excited yelping of sir ger-
wain her wolfhound outside

 that had happened when she was
ten now at twenty-five in the very
midst of undergoing a similar ex-
perience she was able to recall that
earlier one

she stared down in a mounting
sort of mental fear as she watched
her body entirely disappear from be-
neath her leaving only the faintly
glowing frame of her bony struc-
ture and as she watched even that
began to fade away in the bath of
terrible light the source of which
she could not determine soon she
would be a disembodied head floating
above the strange floor

 the hour is at hand princess
isira said the cowled priest for
the fulfillment of your destiny the
sands of time have run their inter-
minable course beyond human com-
prehension is the working of the infi-

temple of ammon her sacred crypt
was violated by vandals and dese-
crators of the dead but you can be-
hold her likeness on the lid of the
sarcophagus in beaten gold

 marjorie westbrook or the con-
sciousness that was marjorie west-
brook stared at the cover of the
ornate case and nearly swooned in
astonishment she recalled the face
on the lid of her own sarcophagus
the one in her boudoir and how its
haunting familiarity had puzzled arid
intrigued her but always it had
remained vague and dim now like
the sensitized image on a print that
has just been withdrawn from de-
veloping fluid the golden features
bathed in that eerie glow were exact
duplicates of her own it was as
though she stared into a burnished
mirror of gold even the wide star-
ing eyes seemed alive with the color
and expression of her own eyes

  and still this fantastic this outre
and bizarre experience was no dream
majorie westbrook was as thor-
oughly awake as she would ever be
never since that soul-shaking and
impossible thing which had happened
to her at the age of ten had she ex-
perienced awake or asleep any fur-
ther manifestation which included so
much as a mention of the lost isames
in her nocturnal materializations-
and there had been at least one for
every year of her life-she had never
again seen this strange twin sister or
heard of her until now it came to
marjorie with a dreadful thrill that
she was in her own twenty-sixth year
right now

  not once during her entire life had
she ever mentioned these weird ad-
ventures to anyone not even to her
doctor it was a closed and sealed
book from the world from even mar-
jorie herself-except in the throes of
the fantastic episodes but it was
not a dream life she knew that it
was some horrible destiny an actual
and solid fate of terrific force and
dim unguessed purpose that stalked
her

 and it did not feed solely upon
the hours of night a mere figment
of her imagination there was that

day when she was seventeen and her
father had taken her to the county
fair normal happy light-hearted
girl of a modern age she had clapped
her hands in delight when the old
gipsy hag in the gay-colored booth
wanted to tell her fortune

  but no sooner had marjorie seated
herself across the table of sand from
the woman than the crystal ball
thereon turned inky black the
woman started in utter dismay and
quickly flung a cloth over the ball
she blanched almost white as she
stared with her sharp black eyes into
marjories blue ones

  let me see your right hand she
said in a tense whisper

  obligingly marjorie stretched out
her slim and girlish hand palm up
without touching her the gipsy
stared with bulging eyes her golden
earrings adance with violent agita-
tion

  no she whispered no no-i
cannot read your destiny child
but that isnt fair pouted mar-
jorie ive paid you a silver dollar
you must read my fortune

  here is your money said the old
woman beginning to shake all over

  i wont have it back declared
marjorie defiantly keep it and
read my fortune

e gipsy groaned

i-i cannot she articulated
with difficulty i dare not i see only
that you have a double existence
you will grow old before your time
-incredibly old

  how old demanded marjorie
thinking the gipsy was putting on a
very good act

  perhaps - perhaps six thousand
years choked out the other and
then with a wild cry the woman fled
from the booth

  that experience had taken place in
broad daylight had occurred to mar-
jorie westbrook without any transi-
tion into another entity another
sphere of life so she knew she was
not crazy and she knew she did
not dream these yearly episodes
which wove that strange irrelevant
and inexplicable pattern through her


strange stories

otherwise normal and sane existence

  no no she cried out in horror
now against a dread of she knew not
what as her skeleton completely dis-
appeared

  but her protests were as naught to
this high priest of ammon who was
the counterpart of artemus russo
and marjorie became aware of a pair
of hands cold and clammy as early
morning fog off the sound which
gripped her head she rolled her
eyes to see a green-gray figure that
had materialized behind her a dis-
embodied spirit that was human only
in outline-an elemental even an
ectoplasmic projection of ankhtares

 she opened her mouth to scream
in terror but no sound came she
thought she was in a silent world of
chimeras and the creature carried
her bodyless head like a football
across the intervening space and set
it firmly on the shoulders of the
linen-wrapped mummy within the
sarcophagus

  thy destiny has been fulfilled
came the voice of ankhtares at
last we shall both have peace

 there was that blinding flash of
light which marjorie westbrook had
come to know so well and every-
thing went into the oblivion of noth-
ingness   

marjorie opened her eyes
the maid was letting in the
sunshine she was safe at home in
her own bed in forest hills the
covers drawn snugly up to her chin

 miss westbrook said the maid
softly it is eleven oclock mr
russo is waiting to see you in the
sitting room he insisted that i wake
you as he has to attend that board
meeting he said he must have your
final word

  marjorie smiled her personal re-
lief was so great that she felt in a

most melting mood toward the man-
ager of her affairs

  very well she said tell him
i am ready to sign those proxies for
him and wind things up wait help
me up first she threw back the
silken coverlet preparatory to sitting
up bring over the-

  she broke off in stunned horror
as she moved it sounded like the
rattling of parchment and dried
bones as she tossed back the cover
instead of a satin night negligee from
paris upon the lovely body of a
twenty-five-year-old beauty she ex-
posed the gray-brown and dried skin
of an egyptian mummy her hands
were two shrunken claws the outline
of the bones showing plainly from
elbow to fingers

  one terrible shriek marjorie west-
brook gave ere death overtook her
the horrible episodes of her noc-
turnal life had finally broken through
the barrier that had always sur-
rounded and protected her-had over-
taken her at last the six thousand
years were up

  the maid stared petrified at the
lovely head perfectly joined to that
of the six-thousand-year-old mummy
of an egyptian woman her eyes
rolled wildly to a corner of the room
where her mistress prized sarcopha-
gus stood and she screamed the
lid was off and the headless mummy
that should have reposed in the case
was gone

  mr russo mr russo she cried
as she fled to the outer room her
voice choked cut off abruptly as she
stared at the couch where she had
left the general manager sitting ly-
ing full-length on the couch was arte-
mus russo his body as still as death
and his face parchment yellow and

a great deal of curiosity has
been aroused by the strange
- affair of the lost bells of mis-
sion san xavier many have wondered

why when the bells were discovered
after remaining hidden for over a
hundred and fifty years they were al-
most immediately smashed and the
fragments buried secretly in view of
the legends of the remarkable tone
and quality of the bells a number of
musicians have written angry letters
asking why at least they were not
rung before their destruction and a
permanent record made of their music

as a matter of fact the bells were
rung and the cataclysmic thing that

i heard a sickening crunch
and saw one of the bells
smash down on sarto

the ancient god
zu-che-quon enemy
of the sun
of darkness is
awakened


strange stories

happened at that time was the direct
reason for their destruction and
when those evil bells were shrieking
out their mad summons in the unprece-
dented blackness that shrouded san
xavier it was only the quick action of
one man that saved the world-yes i
do not hesitate to say it-from chaos
and doom

  as secretary of the california his-
torical society i was in a position to
wdtness the entire affair almost from
its inception i was not present of
course when the bells were unearthed
but arthur todd the president of the
society telephoned me at my home in
los angeles soon after that ill-fated
discovery

  he was almost too excited to speak
coherently weve found them he
kept shouting the bells ross
found them last night back in the
pinos range its the most remarkable
discovery since-since the rosetta
stone

  what are you talking about i
asked groping in a fog of drowsiness
the call had brought me from my
warm bed

  the san xavier bells of course
he explained jubilantly ive seen
them myself just where junipero
serra buried them in  a hiker
found a cave in the pinos and ex-
plored it-and there was a rotting
wooden cross at the end with carving
on it i brought-

 what did the carving say i
broke in

  eh oh-just a minute i have it
here listen let no man hang the
evil bells of the mutsunes which lie
buried here lest the terror of the
night rise again in nueva california
the mutsunes you know were sup-
posed to have had a hand in casting
the bells

  i know i said into the transmit-
ter their shamans were supposed to
have put a magic spell on them

  im-im wondering about that
todd said there have been some
very unusual things happening up
here ive only got two of the bells out
of the cave theres another you
know but the mexicans wont go in
the cave any more they say-well
theyre afraid of something but ill

get that bell if i have to dig it up my-
self

  want me to come up there

  if you will todd said eagerly
im phoning from a cabin in coyote
canyon i left denton-my assistant
-in charge suppose i send a boy
down to san xavier to guide you to
the cave

  all right i assented send him
to the xavier hotel ill be there in a
few hours

san xavier is perhaps a hun-
dred miles from los angeles i
raced along the coast and within two
hours i had reached the little mission
town hemmed in by the pinos range
drowsing sleepily on the edge of the
pacific i found my guide at the hotel
but he was oddly reluctant to return
to todds camp

  i can tell you how to go senor
you will not get lost the boys dark
face was unnaturally pale beneath its
heavy tan and there was a lurking dis-
quiet in his brown eyes i dont want
to go back-

  i jingled some coins its not as
bad as all that is it i asked afraid
of the dark

  he flinched si the-the dark-its
very dark in that cave senor

  the upshot was that i had to go
alone trusting to his directions and
mv own ability in the open

  dawn was breaking as i started up
the canyon trail but it was a strangely
dark dawn the sky was not overcast
but it held a curious gloom i have
seen such oppressively dark days dur-
ing dust storms but the air seemed
clear enough and it was very cold
although even from my height i could
see no fog on the pacific

  i kept on climbing presently i
found myself threading the gloomy
chill recesses of coyote canyon i
shivered with cold the sky was a dull
leaden color and i found myself
breathing heavily in good physical
condition the climb had tired me un-
duly

  yet i was not physically tired-it
was rather an aching oppressive leth-
argy of mind my eyes were watering
and i found myself shutting them
occasionally to relieve the strain i
bells of horror



wished the sun would come over the
top of the mountain

  then i saw something extraordinary
-and horrible it was a toad-gray
fat ugly it was squatting beside a
rock at the side of the trail rubbing
itself against the rough stone one
eye was turned toward me-or rather
the place where the eye should have
been there was no eye-there was
only a slimy little hollow

  the toad moved its ungainly body
back and forth sawing its head against
the rock it kept uttering harsh little
croaks of pain-and in a moment it
had withdrawn from the stone and
was dragging itself across the trail at
my feet

  i stood looking at the stone nause-
ated the gray surface of rock was
bedaubed with whitish streaks of
fetor and the shredded bits of the
toads eye apparently the toad had
deliberately ground out its protruding
eyes against the rock

  it crept out of sight beneath a bush
leaving a track of slime in the dust of
the trail i involuntarily shut my eyes
and rubbed them-and suddenly jerked
down my hands startled at the rough-
ness with which my fists had been dig-
ging into my eye-sockets lancing
pain shot through my temples re-
membering the itching burning sen-
sation in my eyes i shuddered a little
had the same sort of torture caused
the toad deliberately to blind itself
my god

iran on up the trail presently i
passed a cabin-probably the one
from which todd had telephoned for
i saw wires running from the roof to
a tall pine i knocked at the door
no answer  continued my ascent

  suddenly there came an agonized
scream knife-edged and shrill and
the rapid thudding of footsteps i
stopped listening someone was run-
ning down the trail toward me-and
behind him i could hear others racing
shouting as they ran around a bend
in the trail a man came plunging

  he was a mexican and his black-
stubbled face was set in lines of ter-
ror and agony his mouth was open
in a square of agony and insane
screams burst horribly from his throat

but it wasnt that that sent me stag-
gering back out of his path cold sweat
bursting out on my body

  his eyes had been gouged out and
twin trickles of blood dripped down
his face from black gaping hollows

  as it happened there was no need
for me to halt the blinded mans fran-
tic rush at the curve of the trail he
smashed into a tree with frightful
force and momentarily stood upright
against the trunk then very slowly
he sagged down and collapsed in a
limp huddle there was a great splotch
of blood on the rough bark i went
over to him quickly

 four men came running toward me
i recognized arthur todd and den-
ton his assistant the other two were
obviously laborers todd jerked to a
halt

 ross good god-is he dead

  swiftly he bent over to examine the
unconscious man denton and i stared
at each other denton was a tall
strongly-built man with a shock of
black hair and a broad mouth that was
generally expanded in a grin now his
face bore a look of horrified disbelief

  god ross-he did it right before
our eyes denton said through pale
lips he just let out a scream threw
up his hands and tore his eyes out of
their sockets he shut his own eyes
at the memory

 todd got up slowly unlike den-
ton he was small wiry nervously
energetic with a lean brown face and
amazingly alert eyes dead he said

  whats happened i asked trying
to keep my voice steady whats
wrong todd was the man insane

  and all the while i had a picture of
that fat toad tearing out its eyes
against a rock

 todd shook his head his brows
drawn together in a frown i dont
know ross do your eyes feel-odd

 a shiver ran through me damned
odd burning and itching ive been
rubbing them continually on the way
up

  so have the men denton told me
so have we see he pointed to his
eyes and i saw that they were red-
rimmed and inflamed

 the two laborers-mexicans-came
over to us one of them said some-


strange stories

thing in spanish todd barked a sharp
order and they fell back hesitating

  then without further parley they
took to their heels down the trail
denton started forward with an angry
shotit but todd caught his arm no
use he said quickly well have to
get the bells out ourselves

  you found the last one i asked
as he turned back up the trail

 we found them-all three todd
said somberly denton and i dug up
the last one ourselves- and we found
this too

he drew a dirt-encrusted greenish
metal tube from his pocket and
gave it to me within the cylinder was
a sheet of parchment in a remarkably
good state of preservation i puzzled
over the archaic spanish script

  let me todd said taking it care-
fully he translated expertly

   on the twenty-first of june by the
favor of god the attack by the pagan
mutsunes having been repulsed the
three bells cast a month ago were bur-
ied in this secret cave and the entrance
sealed- but a landslide obviously
opened it up again recently todd
broke off to explain

   inasmuch as evil witchcraft was
practiced by the indians when we sus-
pended and rang the bells the evil
demon whom the mutsunes call zu-
che-quon was called from his dwelling
beneath the mountains and brought
the black night and the cold death
among us the large cross was over-
thrown and many of the people were
possessed of the evil demon so that
the few of us who retained our senses
were hard put to it to overcome their
fiend-inspired attack and remove the
bells

   afterward we gave thanks to god
for our preservation and gave aid to
those who were injured in the fray
the souls of those who perished were
commended to god and we prayed
that the san antonio would soon ar-
rive to relieve us from this cruel soli-
tude i charge whomever may find
these bells should it not please god
to allow me to fulfill this duty to send
them to rome in the name of our mas-
ter the king may god guard him 

  todd paused and carefully returned

the parchment to its case junipero
serra signed it he said quietly

  lord what a find i exulted but
-surely you dont think theres any-
thing-

  who said i did todd snapped in
a voice that betrayed his nervous ten-
sion theres some logical explana-
tion-superstition and auto-sugges-
tion are a bad combination i-
wheres sarto denton asked with
a note of apprehension in his voice
we were standing at the edge of a
little clearing bare and rocky
sarto i asked

  he has the cabin down the trail
todd said you must have passed it
i left him here with the bells when
jose had his seizure

  hadnt we better get joses body to
town i asked

  todd frowned dont think me bru-
tal he said but these bells-i cant
leave them here the mans dead we
cant help him and itll take all three
of us to get the bells to town its too
bad the poor chap didnt have dentons
sense of direction he finished with a
grim smile he wouldnt have run
into the tree then

  he was right i believe that denton
could have traversed the entire trail
blindfolded after having once as-
cended it he had a remarkable mem-
ory and sense of direction like those
indians who could unerringly find
their way to their wigwams across
hundreds of miles of wilderness later
this trait of dentons was to be of vital
importance but no premonition of this
came to us at the time

  we had climbed the rocky mountain
slope above the clearing and had come
out in a little glade among the pines
nearby was a gaping hollow in the
ground-around it evidence of a re-
cent landslide

  where the devil todd said star-
ing around how-

  hes gone denton said in amaze-
ment and the bells with him-
then we heard it-a faint hollow
musical note the sound of a bell hit-
ting wood it came from above us and
glancing up the slope we saw an odd
sight a man gaunt bearded with a
blazing thatch of red hair was tugging
at a rope he had stretched over the
bells of horror	

branch of a pine at the other end of
the rope-

  slowly they rose silhouetted against
the sky the lost bells of san xavier
gracefully curved they glowed bronze
even beneath their stains and verdigris
-and they were silent for they had
no clappers once or twice they swung
against the trunk of the pine and sent
out a hollow mournful note how the
man could lift that great weight was
inexplicable i could see the muscles
cord and knot on his bare arms as he
strained his eyes were bulging and
his teeth clenched in a grinning mouth

  sarto denton cried starting to
clamber up the slope what are you
doing

startled the man jerked his
head around and stared at us the
rope slipped through his fingers and
we saw the bells plunge down with a
frightful effort he clutched the rope
and halted their descent momentarily
but the strain threw him off balance
he tottered overbalanced and came
crashing down the slope-and behind
him overtaking him rolled and
bounded the bells throbbing and
booming as they clashed against rocks

  god i heard todd whisper the
mad fool

  there was a maelstrom of dust and
flying shale on the slope above i heard
a sickening crunch and denton threw
himself desperately aside through
the dust i saw one of the bells smash
down on the sliding body of sarto
and then i was stumbling away scrub-
bing furiously at my eyes blinded by
the flying particles of dirt the rattle
and roar subsided slowly as i clung to
a tree i blinked glanced around

  almost at my feet was one of the
bells there was a great crimson stain
upon it the body of sarto was visible
jammed into a bush on the slope above

  and a few feet below it propped
upright against a jagged rock was
sartos battered gory head

  thus ended the first act of the drama
i was to witness

the bells were to be hung two weeks
later there was some stir in the news-
papers and considerable more among
historians pilgrimages of various his-

     continued from page 
torical societies to san xavier from
all over the world were planned

  in the cold daylight of logic out-
side the eerie atmosphere of the pinos
mountains the unusual occurrences
during the unearthing of the bells
were easily explained a virulent kind
of poisoning perhaps similar to poison
oak-or some fungus hidden in the
cave with the relics-had been respon-
sible for our optical irritation and the
madness of sarto and the mexican
neither denton todd nor i denied
this explanation but we discussed the
matter at length among ourselves

  denton went so far as to drive down
to the huntington library to view the
forbidden johann negus translation
of the book of iod that abhorrent and
monstrous volume of ancient esoteric
formulae about which curious legends
still cling only a single copy of the
original volume written in the pre-
human ancient tongue is said to ex-
ist certainly few even know of the
expurgated johann negus translation
but denton had heard vague rumors
about a passage in the book which he
declared might be connected with the
legends of the san xavier bells

  when he returned from los angeles
he brought a sheet of foolscap paper
covered with his execrable penman-
ship the passage he had copied from
the book of iod was this

  the dark silent one dwelleth deep be-
neath the earth on the shore of the west-
ern ocean not one of those potent old
ones from hidden worlds and other stars
is he for in earths hidden blackness he
hath always dwelt no name hath he for
he is the ultimate doom and the undying
emptiness and silence of old night

  when earth is dead and lifeless and the
stars pass into the blackness he will rise
again and spread his dominion over all
for he hath naught to do with life and
sunlight but loveth the blackness and the
eternal silence of the abyss yet can he
be called to earths surface before his
time and the brown ones who dwell on the
shore of the western ocean have power
to do this by ancient spells and certain
deep-toned sounds which reach his dwell-
ing-place far below

  but there is great danger in such a
summoning lest he spread death and night
before his time for he bringeth dark-
ness within the day and blackness within
the light all life all sound all movement
passeth away at his coming he cometh

sometimes within the eclipse and although
he hath no name the brown ones know
him as zushakon

  there was a deletion at that point
denton said as i glanced up from the
excerpt the books expurgated you
know

  its very odd todd said picking
up the paper and running his eyes
over it but of course its merely a
coincidence certainly since folklore
is based on natural phenomena one
can generally find modern parallels
the thunderbolts of jove and apollos
arrows axe merely lightning and sun-
stroke

   never on them does the shining
sun look down with his beams  den-
ton quoted softly  but deadly night
is spread abroad over these hapless
men remember odysseus visit to
the land of the dead

todds mouth twisted wryly
well what of it i dont expect
pluto to come up from tartarus when
the bells are hung do you this is the
twentieth century such things dont
happen-in fact never did happen

 are you sure denton asked
surely you dont pretend to believe
this cold weather were having is nor-
mal

  i glanced up quickly i had been
wondering when someone would men-
tion the abnormal chill in the air

  its been cold before todd said
with a sort of desperate assurance
and overcast too just because were
having some muggy weather is no rea-
son for you to let your imagination get
the upper hand its-good god

 we went staggering across the
room earthquake denton gasped
and we headed for the door we didnt
race for the stairs but remained just
beneath the lintel of the doorway
during an earthquake its the safest
place in any building on account of
the nature and strength of its con-
struction

  but there were no more shocks
denton moved back into the room and
hurried to the window

  look he said breathlessly beck-
oning theyre hanging the bells

bells of horror

xavier two blocks away and in the
arches in the bell tower figures were
toiling over the three bells

  they say when the bells were cast
the indians threw the body of a living
girl into the boiling metal denton
said apropos of nothing

  i know it todd answered snap-
pishly and the shamans enchanted
the bell with their magic dont be a
fool

  why shouldnt some peculiar vi-
bration-like the sound of a bell-
create certain unusual conditions
denton asked hotly and i thought i
detected a note of fear in his voice
we dont know all there is to know
about life todd it may take strange
forms-or even-

  clang-g-g

  the booming ominous note of a bell
rang out it was strangely deep thrill-
ing through my ear-drums and sending
its eerie vibration along my nerves
denton caught his breath in a gasp

  clang-g-g

  a deeper note-throbbing sending
a curious pain through my head some-
how urgent summoning

  clang-g-g-clang-g-g    thunder-
ing fantastic music such as might
issue from the throat of a god or from
the heart-strings of the dark angel
israfel   

 was it growing darker was a
shadow creeping over san xavier
was the pacific darkening from spar-
kling blue to leaden gray to cold
blackness 

  clang-g-g

  then i felt it-a premonitory trem-
ble of the floor beneath my feet the
window rattled in its casing i felt
the room sway sickeningly tilt and
drop while the horizon see-sawed
slowly madly back and forth i heard
a crashing from below and a picture
dropped from the wall to smash against
the floor

  denton todd and i were swaying
and tottering drunkenly toward the
door somehow i felt that the build-
ing wouldnt stand much more it
seemed to be growing darker the
room was filled with a hazy tenebrous
gloom someone screamed shrilly
glass smashed and shattered i saw a

strange stories

     continued from page 
spurt of dust spray out from the wall
and a bit of plaster dropped away
and suddenly i went blind

 at my side denton cried out
abruptly and i felt a hand grip my
arm that you ross i heard todd
ask in his calm voice precise as ever
is it dark

  thats it denton said from some-
where in the blackness im not blind
then where are you wheres the
door

  a violent lurch of the building broke
todds clutch on my arm and i was
flung against the wall over here i
shouted above the crashing and roar-
ing follow my voice

 in a moment i felt someone fum-
bling against my shoulder it was
denton and soon todd joined him

  god whats happening i jerked
out

 those damned bells denton
shouted in my ear the book of iod
was right he bringeth darkness-
within the day-

  youre mad todd cried sharply
but punctuating his words came the
furious ear-splitting dinning of the
bells clanging madly through the
blackness why do they keep ringing
them denton asked and answered
his own question the earthquakes
doing it-the quakes ringing the
bells

  clang-g-g clang-g-g

 something struck my cheek and
putting up my hand i felt the warm
stickiness of blood plaster smashed
somewhere still the earthquake
shocks kept up denton shouted some-
thing which i did not catch

 what todd and i cried simul-
taneously

 bells-weve got to stop them
theyre causing this darkness-per-
haps the earthquake too its vibra-
tion-cant you feel it something in
the vibration of those bells is blanket-
ing the suns light-waves for lights
a vibration you know if we can stop
them-

  it would be a fools errand todd
cried youre talking nonsense-
then stay here i can find my way
-will you come ross

  for a second i did not answer all

the monstrous references gleaned from
our study of the lost bells were flood-
ing back into my mind the ancient
god zu-che-quon whom the mutsunes
were supposed to have the power of
summoning by certain deep-toned
sounds-he cometh sometimes with-
in the eclipse all life passeth away
at his coming yet can he be called
to earths surface before his time-

  im with you denton i said

  then damn it so am i todd
snapped ill see the end of this if
there is anything-

he did not finish but i felt hands
groping for mine ill lead
denton told us take it easy now

  i wondered how denton could find
his way in that enveloping shroud of
jet blackness then i remembered his
uncanny memory and sense of direc-
tion no homing pigeon could make a
straighter way to its destination than
he

  it was a mad odyssey through a
black hell of shrieking ruin flying
objects screamed past us unseen walls
and chimneys toppled and smashed
nearby frightened hysterical men
and women blundered into us in the
dark and went shouting away vainly
searching for escape from this stygian
death-trap

  and it was cold-cold a frigid and
icy chill pervaded the air and my fin-
gers and ears were already numbed
and aching the icy air sent knife-
edged pains slashing through my
throat and lungs as i breathed i
heard denton and todd wheezing and
gasping curses as they stumbled along
beside me

 how denton ever found his way
through that chaotic maelstrom i shall
never understand

  here denton shouted the mis-
sion

 somehow we mounted the steps
how the mission managed to stand
through the grinding shocks i do not
know what probably saved it was the
curious regularity of the temblors-
the quakes were more of a rhythmic
slow swaying of the earth than the
usual abrupt wrenching shocks

  from nearby came a low chanting
incongruous in the madness around us
bells of horror

  gloria patri filio spiritui sanc-
to   

  the franciscans were praying but
what availed their prayers while in the
tower the bells were sending out their
blasphemous summons luckily we
had often visited the mission and den-
ton knew his way to the tower

 on that incredible climb up the
stairs to the bell tower i shall not
dwell although every moment we were
in danger of being dashed down to
instant death but at last we won to
the loft where the bells were shriek-
ing their thunder through the black-
ness almost in our ears denton re-
leased my hand and shouted something
i could not distinguish there was an
agony of pain in my head and my flesh
ached with the cold i felt an over-
powering impulse to sink down into
black oblivion and leave this hellish
chaos my eyes were hot burning
aching   

  for a moment i thought i had lifted
my hands unconsciously to rub my
eyes then i felt two arms constrict
about my neck and vicious thumbs dug
cruelly into my eye-sockets i shrieked
with the blinding agony of it

  clang-g-g-clang-g-g

  i battled desperately in the dark-
ness battling not only my unknown
assailant but fighting back a mad per-
verse impulse to allow him to gouge
out my eyes within my brain a voice
seemed to whisper why do you need
eyes  blackness is better-light brings
pain blackness is best   

  but i fought fiercely silently roll-
ing across the swaying floor of the
bell-tower smashing against the walls
tearing those grinding thumbs away
from my eyes only to feel them come
fumbling back and still within my
brain that horrible urgent whisper
grew stronger you need no eyes
eternal blackness is best   

  i was conscious of a different note
in the clamor of the bells what was
it there were only two notes now-
one of the bells had been silenced
somehowe the cold was not so oppres-
sive and-was a grayish radiance be-
ginning to pervade the blackness

certainly the temblors were less vio-
lent and as i strained to break away

     continued from page 
from my shadowy opponent i felt the
racking shocks subside grow gentler
die away altogether the harsh clangor
of the two bells stopped

 my opponent suddenly shuddered
and stiffened i rolled away sprang
up in the grayness alert for a re-
newal of the attack it did not come

  very slowly very gradually the
darkness lifted from san xavier

  grayness first like a pearly opales-
cent dawn then yellowish fingers of
sunlight and finally the hot blaze of
a summer afternoon from the bell-
tower i could see the street below
where men and women stared up un-
believingly at the blue sky at my feet
was the clapper from one of the bells

  denton was swaying drunkenly his
white face splotched with blood his
clothing torn and smeared with dust
that did it he whispered only
one combination of sounds could sum-
mon-tiie thing when i silenced
one bell-

  he was silent staring down at our
feet lay todd his clothing dishevelled
his face scratched and bleeding as
we watched he got weakly to his feet
a look of monstrous horror growing in
his eyes involuntarily i shrank back
my hands going up protectingly

he flinched ross he whispered
through white lips my god
ross-i-i couldnt help it i couldnt
help it i tell you something kept
telling me to put out your eyes-and
dentons too-and then to gouge out
my own a voice-in my head-
and abruptly i understood remem-
bering that horrible whisper within
my brain while i struggled with poor
todd that malignant horror-he
whom the book of iod called zusha-
kon and whom the mutsunes knew as
zu-che-quon-had sent his evil potent
command into our brains-command-
ing us to blind ourselves and we had
nearly obeyed that voiceless dreadful
command

  but all was well now or was it

  i had hoped to close the doors of
my memory forever on the entire hor-
rible affair for it is best not to dwell
too closely upon such things and de-
spite the storm of adverse criticism

best fun fiction and fotos in


and curiosity that was aroused by the
smashing of the bells the next day
with the full permission of father
bernard of the mission i had fully
determined never to reveal the truth
of the matter

  it was my hope that only three men
-denton todd and myself-might
hold the key to the horror and that it
would die with us yet something has
occurred which forces me to break my
silence and place before the world the
facts of the case denton agrees with
me that perhaps thus mystics and oc-
cultists who have knowledge of such
things may be enabled to utilize their
knowledge more effectually if what
we fear ever comes to pass

  two months after the affair at san
xavier an eclipse of the sun occurred
at that time i was at my home in los
angeles denton was at the headquar-
ters of the historical society in san
francisco and arthur todd was oc-
cupying his apartment in hollywood

  the eclipse began at  pm and
within a few moments of the begin-
ning of the obscuration i felt a strange
sensation creeping over me a dread-
fully familiar itching manifested it-
self in my eyes and i began to rub
them fiercely then remembering i
jerked down my hands and thrust them
hastily into my pockets but the burn-
ing sensation persisted

  the telephone rang grateful for
the distraction i went to it hurriedly
it was todd

 he gave me no chance to speak
ross ross-its back he cried into
the transmitter ever since the eclipse
began ive been fighting its power
was strongest over me you know it
wants me to- help me ross i cant
keep- then silence 

 todd i cried wait-hold on
just for a few moments ill be there 

  no answer i hesitated then hung
up and raced out to my car it was a
normal twenty-minute drive to todds
apartment but i covered it in seven
with my lights glowing through the
gloom of the eclipse and mad thoughts
crawling horribly in my brain a
motorcycle officer overtook me at my
destination but a few hurried words
brought him into the apartment house

 at my side todds door was locked
 after a few fruitless shouts we burst
 it open the electric lights were blaz-
 ing

  what cosmic abominations may be
summoned to dreadful life by age-old
spells-and sounds-is a question i
dare not contemplate for i have a hor-
rible feeling that when the lost bells
of san xavier were rung an unearthly
and terrible chain of consequences
was set in motion and i believe too
that the summoning of those evil bells
was more effective than we then real-
ized

  ancient evils when roused to life
 may not easily return to their brood-
 ing sleep and i have a curious horror
 of what may happen at the next eclipse
 of the sun somehow the words of the
 hellish book of iod keep recurring to
 me-yet can he be called to earths
 surface before his time he bring-
 eth darkness all life all sound all
 movement passeth away at his com-
 ing-and worst of all that horribly
 significant phrase he cometh some-
 times within the eclipse

  just what had happened in todds
 apartment i do not know the tele-
 phone receiver was dangling from the
 wall and a gun was lying beside my
 friends prostrate form but it was
 not the scarlet stain on the left breast
 of his dressing-gown that riveted my
 horror-blasted stare-it was the hol-
 low empty eye-sockets that glared up
 sightlessly from the contorted face-
 that and the crimson-stained thumbs
 of arthur todd

   but there was no blood the flesh was
 rancid like the body of a dead man long
 buried

  later the corporal would have been
 court-martialed for causing the death of
 the soldiers who had responded to his false
 signal were it not for the testimony of the
 private and also the sworn statements by
 chinese merchants of the village that
 zombies had long worked in the grain
 fields beyond the village

   this chinese gunner was a zombie he
 had been placed at this gun and ordered
 by the satanic will of his master to pull
 the trigger whenever soldiers appeared be-
 fore him like an automaton he had re-
 sponded until blown to bits removing what
 demonic power had been able to control
 his bloodless corpse

  zombies bodies of dead men housing
 the magic of the devil who can tell at
 least give the devil his due-lucifer

letters from readers

 speaking of the devil and his due we
 think it only fair to do the same for
 those disciples of lucifer who have some
 diabolical or praiseworthy comments to
 make about strange stories we
 cant possibly include the thousands who
 responded so nobly to our request for let-
 ters but we can dip into the brew at ran-
 dom and ladle out extracts from as many
 letters as we have room for to all how-
 ever who wrote in we are grateful as
 even devils can be and we invite you to
 continue your personal dissections of our
 attempts to present the uncanny and
 strange

   here goes then with our brew a cupful
 from robt a madle phila pa

   i was indeed pleased to note the appearance of
 the first issue of strange stories

   the cover picture does not typify the type of
 stories published please have a real fantastic
 cover on the next issue-many of your interior
 artists are quite capable of painting excellent
 covers thanks for the variety of artists-theyre
 all good with wesso and paul doing the best
 work it would be a good idea to have several
 drawings each issue by virgil finlay he is unsur-
 passable when it comes to illustrating weird fic-
 tion

    the stories themselves were either good or fair
 with the sorcerers jewel by tarleton
 fiske and major mccrarys vision by ralph
 farley the most outstanding it might be a good
 idea to print stories of pure fantasy in future
 issues-and please subordinate the dead man ris-
 ing from his grave to wreak vengeance on his
 killer etc for this reason i didnt care for
 henry kuttners the frog kuttner usually
 writes very excellent fantasy but he fell down this
 time wellmaps changeling was a nice little
 piece of fantasy cant gay ive read anything
 similar to it before on the whole the first issue
 of strange stories was fairly good but there
 is plenty room for improvement

   of course theres room for improvement

-and we welcome the suggestions of
reader madle we dip into the cauldron
now and come up with the following from
harold f feating of quincy mass

 please keep the standard of strange stories
up to its present level commenting on the stories
in the first issue the singing shadows was
superb although written by an author i have
never heard or before the cdrse of the
house-another grand story by a longtime favor-
ite of mine robert bloch eyes op the ser-
pent-by two more of my favorite authors der-
leth and sohorer fairly good but not up to their
usual high standard the invaders-excellent
although keith hammond is also a new name to
me changeling by wellman is a perfect exam-
ple of weirdness the sorcerers jewel by
fiske-another fine weird yarn and another new
author

  good illustrators in issue- wesso morey paul
jack binder    the black arts is a grand
department written as convincingly as any fiction
keep this department i hope too you will have
some kind of a club similar to the seieuee-fietion
league of thrilling wonder stories of
which i am a member and heres to your coming
out more frequently

 yes were planning a club and will tell
you about it in the next issue down goes
the ladle again and we come up with a
couple of short spoonsful b reagan
pittsburgh pa says

  your first issue of strange stories hits the
spot the subject matter is varied to suit any
taste so keep up the good work would like to
see a vampire story in the next issues a good out-
right ghost story will not be overlooked either

 and gertrude gordon of new york city
congratulates and criticizes us with

 strange stories is splendid and i am a
devotee of fantastic fiction if it keeps to its pres-
ent stature it will be in the lead of the several
really good magazines dealing with the uncanny
but please not those kind of pictures on the covers
i didnt get the magazine for a long time thinking
it was a horror or terror type then i looked
through it one day and found to my delight it
wasnt-but the picture is so misleading if you
have something definitely fantastic on the cover
im sure youve got something there

 we hope so stirring the brew around
again up pops weaver wright of holly-
wood calif

  i am sorry to say i found the first issue ol
strange stories too interesting to ignore yon
see i et fantasy mags galore including your
companion magazines thrilling wonder
stories and startling stories so i had
hoped-my interests being primarily scientific-
fictional and my time all occupied-that strange
stories would be too predominantly weird to
warrant my actually reading it only filing it away
to keep my collection complete but if youre go-
ing to offer nifty feature stories regular- like
the stnging shadows-an absorbing uncanny
yarn farley yarn major mccrarys vision
and paul-pictured invaders i enjoyed next best
as for illustrations the frog and servant
op satan by marchioni and schomburg klines
story however was a grave dekiine for its author
-or maybe it was ohost-written 

  one complaint poor cover no individuality
one big compliment the novocious motion of hav-
ing every story illustrated by a different artist

 and heres some liquid we bring to the
surface tagged g ross jobe of jefferson
city mo

  i never thought i would ever be in a position to
correct an editor and i wouldnt let this chance

city state
the black arts



pass by for lots of money because ive taken so
many corrections from them in the black
arts department lucifer states that king saul
saw the ghost of solomon tut tut- according to
the bible he asked for and saw the wraith of
samuel    the february edition was beyond
doubt a fine one

  and beyond doubt reader jobe is cor-
rect chalk up one lapsis mentis for luci-
fer the devil has his weak moments
now bubbling up from our cauldron comes
douglas robinson from garrett hill pa

  i am interested in a black arts organization
i think the magazine is the best of its kind please
send me information about the items of king saul
and salem i would like to get any kind of infor-
mation aud stories of black arts

  for king saul we refer you to the first
book of samuel chapter  verses -
and for salem witchcraft among others
there are the following books narratives
of witchcraft cases by george l burr
scribners sundry documents of witch-
craft in mass by geo w chamberlain
new england historical society and
witchcraft in salem by john fiske
houghton mifflin co

  our ladle dips up a weighty bowlful
from j h mason of toronto ontario
weve absorbed the criticisms and sugges-
tions as well as the praises and will give
proper consideration to them but all we
have room for now are a few comments
on the stories

  the stories are for the most part very good and
rate as follows

  	the curse of the house the invad-
ers and the sorcerers jewel tied for
first place if you produce three such stories as
these per issue i wont be doing much growling

  	wellmans little gem the changeling
would take second place

  	farleys short hit me in somewhat the same
way as wellmans-nice and pleasing

  then come eyes of the serpent and the
frog followed by the singing shadows
very well written but not quite bizarre enough
and finally servant of satan

  another list by r dodson of baltimore
md who thinks the first issue shows
promise of excellence rates stories in fol-
lowing order

   the changeling by wellman  the
singing shadows by cornier  the in-
vaders by hammond  major mccrarys
vision by farley  eyes of the serpent
by derleth and schorer  the sorcerers
jewel bv fiske  servant of satan by
kline  the frog by kuttner  the curse
of the house by bloch

  bill oconnor of hartford conn ex-
presses his opinion as follows

  congrats on new magazine and super-congrats
to keith hammond for his invaders a -star
story the others the sorcerers jewel-
 stars curse of the house-- stars
changeling the frog major mccrarys
vision- stars servant of satan-
stars singing shadows- stars eyes of
the serpent- stars

 thanks to everybody-and keep those
swell letters rolling in

but he didnt even know my name until the

enrolled for a course of home study and was
doing fine work

   whos william harris he asked
then he looked me up told me he was glad
to see i was ambitious said hed keep his
eye on me

  he did too gave me my chance when
frank jordan was sent out on the road i
was promoted over older men who had been
