thousands aretjuwindtheii glasses away
why dontyou can

  v-ylasses are only eye crutches
t they simply bolster up the
vy eyes-they cannot cure or
t eliminate the conditions re-
sponsible for the trouble they are use-
ful just as crutches are useful for an in-
jured leg but they can no more restore
your eyes to their former strength
than crutches can mend a
broken limb the real help must
come from other sources in the
case of the eyes it is exercise

  over  years ago bernarr
macfadden father of physical
culture had a most trying ex-
perience with his eyes due to
many nights of hard literary
work under poor artificial light
they became terribly strained

the idea of wearing glasses was
intolerable so always willing to
back up his theories by experimenting
upon himself he immediately started in
upon a course of natural treatment that
he fully believed would help him

   the results were so entirely satisfactory
that he associated himself with one of the
few really great eye specialists and to-
gether they entered upon a period of re-
search and experiment covering many
years

  a startling revolutionary
  system of eye training

  upon their findings has been based a
remarkable new scientific system of eye-
training which quickly enables you to
train these muscles of the eye so that
you can make them work properly at all
times and without effort or strain this
new system has been prepared by bernarr
macfadden in collaboration with the
eminent ophthalmologist who discovered
the real truth about eyes

                  although
                this remark-
                able system
                lias only re-
                cently been in-
                troduced to the
                public it has
                been in use for
                more than
                twenty years
                and it has been
                conclusively
                proven of ines-
                timable value

    if you already wear glasses find
  out how you can discard your glasses
  -and see better without them if
  you do not wear glasses but feel
  that your sight is failing then find
  out how a few minutes each day assures
  you perfect sight without the use of

make this test of your eyesight

do you know that th

 inches directly before you cloea the left eye and fix
the right eye on the croee then bring the diagram grad-
ually closer and about  inchaa the black spot will aud

particularly if you havo any y troubl

  glasses if you are a parent send at once
  for this method and learn how to save
  your children from the scourge of near-
  sightedness how you can save them from
  the slavery of eye-glasses and how you
  can train their eyes so they will always
  have perfect normal vision

for what price
would you sell your eyes

    the benefits which you can derive
  from this new method of eye training
  may seem too surprising to be true yet
  you cannot doubt its efficacy when you
  read the letters from the people who
  have found it of immeasurable value
  when you know that it has helped over

  	children to regain normal vision
  in a short time your eyesight is your
  most important possession it can
  never be replaced if it is lost and
  since no amount of money could make
  you sacrifice your eyes you owe it
  to yourself at least to investigate what
  this new scientific method can do for
  you

    here is a man who writes strength-
  ening the eyes has enabled me to com-
  pletely forget the optician it has
  practically cured a bad case of astig-
  matism

    and here is another who says by
  faithfully following the directions given
  in your eye course i have discarded
  glasses worn for years and have had
  absolutely no trouble for the past two
  years

   another grateful reader of this help-
ful book writes i had been wearing
glasses since i was eight years of age and
could not go a day without them i am
now twenty-four and with just a little
effort in practicing the eye exercises
each day for a period of two months
i have been able to stop wearing
glasses entirely

  these inspiring results bring
a message of hope to every-
one who is troubled with weak
eyes or poor sight there is
hardly any condition that is
beyond the reach of bernarr
macfaddens revolutioniz-
ing method of eye training
even the hopeless cases as
shown in the letter reproduced
here respond with almost unbe-
lievable results to the treatment
outlined by the noted physical culturist

you can try this course
at our risk

tion afflicted with eye-trouble to examine

waip sky-buddies carry oju iris times of peacej

obeying one of those strange whims to which
he was often subject since the big war brock
jims left the continental limited at flagstaff
instead of continuing on to st louis the des-
tination written on his ticket jims changed
his mind because of an ad of a flagstaff company which
he saw in an arizona paper it announced an air-transpor-
tation service to the great rainbow natural bridge in
southern utah jims left the train during the night and went
to a hotel his two best buddies in the war had come from
arizona and had never tired of telling him of the wonders of
that state but jims acquaintance with arizona had been
from the car windows of the transcontinental limited the
fact that those two buddies were from flagstaff might sub-
consciously have had something to do with jims sudden
whim to stop off but he did not realize it

  he arose early the following morning with a strange ner-
vous eagerness while breakfasting he decided to scout
around to see if he could locate those former buddies they
might have continued to drift about the country as he had
since returning from the war the war had done strange
things to jims he was nearly always broke drifting about
from job to job with the various air-transportation com-
panies for a year following the war he had piloted mail-
planes

  jims discovered that flagstaff was not very large a vil-
lage he thought after a survey of the few narrow streets
coke airfield was out by the park jims soon came to the
conclusion that he had made a bad bet in stopping off for
the air company whose ad he had read and with whom he

    

had hoped to get a job probably did not have more than one
or two planes at the worst he might be able to get a job
as grease monkey

  jims went back to the lobby of the hotel to wait until busi-
ness hours began he took a seat near the window and
had been there but a few minutes when he saw a tall lanky
youngish-oldish looking man coming down the street and
recognized him as his former buddy fred murphy fred
murphys daring in smashing balloons ringed about with
the famous nests of german archies had won for him the
title of balloon buster murphy had been an ace among
the best of them

drock jims rushed out to the street and up to murphy
with outstrctchcd hand murphy stopped in surprise a
smile broke his features as he recognized his former pal
jims noticed right away that murphy had changed much
but in his blue eyes and about his lips was that same expres-
sion that almost all flyers had worn during those red days
when men were coming down like flies when a mans life
in the air was measured in minutes brock jims fred
murphy tom whitlock and ared jones all in the same
squadron had been unusually lucky the armistice had
found all four still able to take the air ared jones had
been cashiered from the army following the cessation of the
war there was a rather bad story behind him all four
had flown together but jones had never been accepted by the
others as a friend

  hello brock said murphy lord im glad to see
you what are you doing
aru adventure-seeking pilots gets
morej tkrills tkaru hej was looking foj
tikeru hej drops into tkej nest
of a treackerous skymans

  i have a job in st louis but i read an ad in an arizona
paper and on the spur of the moment dropped off here
say fred how big a concern is the rainbow bridge trans-
portation company think i could get a job

  murphy started suddenly and then to jims surprise
looked up and down the street furtively it is a large out-
fit murphy said speaking hurriedly im working there
block and say if you want a job go up there right away
and apply i happen to know they want another flyer
the tourist business to rainbow natural bridge is picking
up and listen brock dont tell them any one that you and
i are former buddies dont ask me to explain now i
cant go up and get that job and dont even act like you
ever heard of me god im glad you showed up ill ex-
plain all this the first chance i get you alone murphy
turned to go but paused and flung from the corner of his
mouth tom whitlock is chief deputy sheriff here in
flagstaff

  jims hurried into the hotel murphy went on down the
street jims was puzzled but he knew murphy had some
good reason his manner had been one of worry and grave
thought theres something up all right muttered jims
dang glad i stopped over and so tom is chief deputy
sheriff hmmm i wonder what connection he has with
all murphys mystery

  jims found coke airport nestling among the tall pines
with the towering white-capped san francisco peaks above
the field was rather large and in much better condition than

he expected to find in such a small place as flagstaff on
the west side were a number of small hangars and two planes
on the east were long hangars and other buildings above
which hung a sign announcing that this was the rainbow
bridge transportation company beneath this in small
lettering was the name of dick richards prop to jims
further surprise in front of the hangars at the proper dis-
tance a long white line ran the length of the field that
one thing brought back with a jolt the war days three
huge planes were on this dead-line mechanics working on
them busily

after a few minutes of conversation with a man who
stood by looking on jims learned that this was a live
wire company they owned seven planes now and contem-
plated adding five more if the tourist business continued
picking up sightseers who wished to visit the bridge were
not at all lacking the rainbow bridge transportation com-
pany had made a landing field close to the natural bridge in
utah at considerable expense and the trip could now be
made comfortable by air it cost a figure less than when the
natural wonder could be visited only by pack train and in far
less time as the trip by air required but a few hours if they
so desired tourists could go and return in the same day
most of them however stayed several days

  a grease monkey pointed out the superintendents office
to jims in a few minutes he was facing charlie kruger
across a polished desk the blond giant blue-eyed weighing

                                      


flying stories

over two hundred pounds looked jims over coolly and
nodded at his question

  we need another flyer now flew in the war didnt
you kruger asked

  yes returned jims flew mail for a year and have
just been knocking about the country since think id like
to stick here a while here are any discharge papers you
want to see

  any special reason why youd like a job here kruger
shot at him

  no said jims and was on the point of saying he had a
job waiting in st louis but thought better of it

  kruger turned away and jims rather thought the man
was smiling to himself still no definite expression ap-
peared on his face

  from outside came the roar of a plane kruger had
been shuffling some papers on the desk now he turned to
jims and the smile which jims had merely suspected was
on his lips deep in krugers blue eyes jims saw much in
those eyes lurked the spirit of a man who went through
life with one fixed purpose and in the pools of those
eyes lay something sinister deep kruger would be a
hard merciless enemy a dangerous man in a fight for
jims knew that kruger would use every means that came
to his hands to gain his end

ves kruger was saying you are hired now im
more than glad to get you now there is much you must
know about these trips to the rainbow natural bridge and
the tourist business its more than a business its an art
ill send you to utah on the next ship taking off so that you
may learn the landmarks and the way

  when kruger paused the office door was opened and in
hurried a tall well-built curly-headed man jims stiffened
at sight of him for it was tom whitlock there was no
deputy sheriffs star in evidence he looked at jims and
straight through him without a sign of recognition jims
took his cue immediately and acted likewise

  whitlock went to the railing before krugers desk hello
charlie hows the dude business was his greeting

  krugers movements when he turned to face whitlock
were like those of a big cat about to leap on its prey he
merely nodded in salutation whitlock turned abruptly to
jims

  what are you doing in flagstaff he asked

  jims looked at whitlock for a moment in the latters
eyes he read a message that tom was trying to get over

  i dont know that thats any of your business snapped
jims with some heat

  whitlock laughed im the deputy sheriff

  well what the hell do i care who you are said jims
rudely

  kruger was watching this byplay with a half smile

  maybe i didnt show my meaning plain enough said
whitlock its like this i wasnt asking you officially ex-
actly you see the hotel clerk where you stayed last night
is a friend of mine he knew we were looking for a pilot
the county officials are taking to the air after cattle rustlers
and other crooks now weve bought a plane all we need
is a pilot you told the hotel clerk you were a flyer and
asked the location of coke field well i rushed right up
here in case kruger here didnt hire you so you wouldnt
get away how about it want a job then turning to
kruger im not butting in you understand charlie if
you have already hired this man im withdrawing my offer

  again kruger turned with the movements of a big cat
his smile was questioning ive already hired this man
why dont you fly the plane yourself whitlock

  jims saw that whitlock was startled for the moment but
he covered it up quickly

  well charlie i could but i am going to be might busy
keeping up the chief deputys end of the job you see
sheriff bradbum is going to retire some day and who
knows i might want to be the sheriff of coconino county

  kruger laughed easily i might fire a man for you he
said if i do ill send him over to see you

  that will be kind of you charlie well i must be going
on if a stray pilot does show up send him over to the
sheriffs office will you

  kruger watched whitlock catlike until he had closed
the door behind him he was explaining further the duties
which would be required of jims when murphy came in
he hardly noticed jims threw no more than a casual glance
his way

  mcmullen said you wanted to see me he said to kruger
  i did yes said kruger youre fired i

  a moment of silence in the office then murphy smiled
jims knew that smile of old he has seen murphy smile in
exactly that manner when once he climbed out of the wreck-
age of his smashed plane in flanders he smiled in just
that same way when he rushed into fight against overwhelm-
ing odds in the air

  you cant fire me he told kruger

  oh i cant cant i said kruger hike right over
to the quarters and start packing up

  i said you cant fire me murphy was still smiling
and you cant just call up dick richards and youll find
out why he told me to tell you that in case you ever did
try it besides that i dont like you kruger for seven
dollars and a half id punch your nose right here

  kruger went red with rage he jerked the phone toward
him held it a moment in doubt and then flung it from him
he stood up and wheeled toward murphy such rage as
purpled krugers face jims had never seen before the
man in his anger was drawing himself up with squared
shoulders his eyes flashed hate it struck jims that
kruger was certainly a man of military experience neither
of the other two saw jims rise quietly and approach

  just when they were upon the point of flying at each
others throats kruger abruptly resumed control of him-
self forget it murphy he said shortly get into flying
togs and take out that party of three at nine oclock
murphy laughed harshly jims wondered what kept mur-
phy from tearing into kruger he knew the fighting irish-
man of old but both men seemed to be drawing away
warily keeping an armed truce

  some of these days kruger im going to take you apart
and see what makes your face get so red when you are
mad said murphy turning on his heel

  kruger stared at the floor a minute after murphy left
when he spoke again his voice was brisk and sharp the
manner of an officer of the old school giving orders dont
get the idea that im not the boss around here he said i
am richards is rather too sentimental toward his flyers
because murphy was the first pilot here we must let him
have his own way but one of these days soon murphy is
going to get his or else richards will find himself without
a superintendent

tzruger went to the door and opened it pointing to
the back of a man in flying togs standing near the
plane warming up on the line that is mcmullen go out
and introduce yourself tell him i said to show you the
corner room in the quarters next to the hangars

  jims went out to the line and paused beside the pilot
  you are mcmullen

  i am what do you want said the pilot turning

  jims looked squarely into the pilots face then he got
himself in hand with an effort for this man who called
himself mcmullen now was the pilot ared jones who
had been cashiered from the service almost ten years before

  jims saw immediately that jones knew him and that he
was waiting to see if jims had recognized him the years
had done much to change jones where once his hair had
been a deep brown it was now red the odd-looking red
that henna gives to the hair in a moment jones looked
relieved for jims gave no sign he had recognized the
disgraced former pilot
above the rainbow



  kruger said youd show me the corner room next to the
hangars in the quarters said jims evenly im a new
pilot who just got on this morning

  wondering greatly at the swift succession of surprises
jims followed mcmullen to the pilots quarters close to the
main hangar mcmullen showed him the room which was
large airy and well-furnished he excused himself on the
plea of business and left jims alone

tims phoned for his bag and trunk he spent the rest of
v the morning overhauling his flying gear and settling his
room at noon he went to the mess hall which adjoined the
cook shack all the pilots and mechanics ate at the same
mess both murphy and mcmullen were absent and jims
learned from the others that they probably would not get
in until after nightfall as they had taken out parties of
tourists to the rainbow bridge

  kruger sent for jims during the afternoon and took him
around the hangars he was assigned a big h v ship and
given a grease monkey and a mechanic in five minutes
alone with his ground crew jims ascertained that the men
at the transportation company hangars were equally di-
vided in likes and dislikes for kruger mcmullen appeared
to be krugers only close friend

  dat mcmullen and de proosian are jist like two peas

  he came to the vacant lot and in the shadows of a sign
board at the curb stood a small fast roadster he got in
the car and sat down presently from a side street came
whitlock walking fast he climbed in started the motor
and the little car went hurrying down a darkened street and
into the open country

  by gawd jims talk about being glad to see somebody i
put her there old kid exclaimed whitlock

  they shook hands say why all the mystery demanded
jims murphy and you have about finished me off honest
im beginning to think this town is full of crazy people

  whew said whitlock believe me murphy and i are
having the time of our lives maybe he put it on a little
bit too strong with you you see its this way this town
is being overrun with bootleg whisky not only that but
somebody up this way is flooding the whole state murphy
is working for us the sheriffs office under cover but it
seems to be common knowledge for they have tried to kill
him twice one dark night they slugged him on a side
street and just a week ago another plane tried to run him
down one night when he was coming home from utah
weve worked it from every angle and theres just one
thing this whisky is coming here in planes and dien in
some manner being distributed to various points by trucks
theres precious few planes in this country yet and we

  jims was hanging low over the canyon country again when the roar of
another ship came to him he cut the motor and then opened the gun
wide zooming the other ship was close and coming out of the south

  a moment later a strange singing went across the wings of his plane
jims saw the stabbing flame from a machine-gun as he nosed down with
a power dive he darted the hv up under the other ship and hung
there for a moment so this pilot was gunning for him jims felt
the old war-time thrill which was quickly dispelled here he was
badly handicapped

  weaponlessl

opined the friendly greasehound bot bad what i mean
you mean to say kruger is a prussian asked jims
quickly all at once it struck him that kruger was a teu-
tonic name was that why murphy hated kruger

  naw i dont know exactly he is admitted the grease
monkey some say he talks about fighting wit de ameri-
cans in france but we calls him de proosian because he
gives orders like one if you get wot i means

  jims was with the group that gathered about mcmullens
plane as it taxied up to the line at sunset some of the pi-
lots inquired about murphy and mcmullen reported that
he had stayed over to bring back a party of tourists about
noon the following day jims had hung around after sup-
per in hope of getting to talk to murphy but now that he
would have to wait a while longer he decided to go into
town and see a show a block from the theater he stopped
at a tobacco shop when he left the lighted lobby he ran
into whitlock

  whitlock paused momentarily go down this street to
a vacant lot get in the car at the curb whitlock kept
moving on as he spoke jims said not a word but continued
on down the street
by golly he said to himself if this keeps up much
longer im going to get the creeps and get em bad

know that there are just two ways the bootleg ring is trans-
porting their stuff here either they have their own plane
hidden away somewhere which seems more likely since a
ship tried to get murphy in the air or else they are using
a ship from the rainbow transportation company in the
latter case kruger would have to be in with the boot-
leggers and at least three other men at the field

  murphy believes this he hates kruger like the devil
says he believes kruger is a german and that he fought
against us in the late lamented war in some way we are
close to this bootleg ring without knowing it and they are
getting desperate else why two attempts to get murphy
and once another car crashed into me if i hadnt had a
piece of good luck theyd have got me right whitlock
drove on in silence for a few minutes then continued
murphy was tickled pink you came to flagstaff and on
the spur of the moment he conceived a plan he hurried to
me and thats why i went to kruger while you were there
this morning we want you to help us out you must work
under cover you must not be known to murphy and me
thats the why-for of all the mystery and strange acting
what do you say

  sure im with you and murphy said jims you knew
id help out my old pals so some bird tried to wash mur-


flying stories

phy out of the air say tom do you know that bird mc-
mullen at the field is none other than ared jones

  we sure do and we wonder at the change in name
plus a weak attempt at disguise say you didnt let  you
knew who he was

  no i took the hint from all this atmosphere of mystery
and didnt let a peep out of me

  thats fine we had better be turning around here i
have some official business to attend to tonight ive given
you a rough story of the case you and murphy find out all
you can richards is working with us too he doesnt be-
lieve that a ship from his hangars is doing the dirty work
im not inclined to think so myself but murphy does
whitlock slowed down stopped and backed into a road
turning off another car came roaring down the main
highway and swerved past them at furious speed

toy howdy those birds must be in an awful hurry
said whitlock slipping his car into high he went into
more details of the rum running then when two miles
had slipped by the red rear-light of a car showed up ahead
as they drew closer they recognized the big touring-car
that had roared past them a few minutes before the ma-
chine was drawing over to the side to allow them to pass

  jims and tom saw the shapes of several men as they drove
past whitlock pulled down the gas lever and they raced for
town for he did not wish jims to be recognized while with
him the touring-car behind them suddenly came roaring
toward them at full speed a bullet sang into the roadster
crashed through the windshield with a splintering of glass
followed immediately by the sound of a high-powered rifle
behind them whitlock reached forward shut off the lights
and gave the little car more gas at the same time the rifle
roared again

  theres a rifle in a scabbard beneath your feet brock
said whitlock

  jims hurriedly got out the rifle and turned backwards in
the seat the lights of the other car were shining full upon
them as he drew aim with the rifle the touring-car lights
went out jims fired at that moment the two cars were
now rushing along the highway toward flagstaff at a furi-
ous speed both were unlighted whitlock was too good a
driver however to crack up unless the unforeseen occurred
red flame stabbed the night from the touring-car instantly
jims fired again a hail of lead spattered about the roadster
in answer the lights of the town appeared abruptly around
a bend the lights of the touring-car shot on and it swerved
from the highway into a side road and went roaring on
quickly disappearing over a small hill whitlock slowed the
roadster down and turned on the lights the dash board
light showed his face grim and tight-lipped

  well hows that for your initiation into the game eh
brock 

  if they had used a lewis gun id have to pinch myself
to see if we werent back in flanders

  lets get to that plane of yours tom and see what we
can discover about that murderous car from the air
exactly my idea brock but you dont go im going
to let you off here on this dark street ill hurry to the
hangar and get into the air chances are though that car
will be in hiding some place

  jims protested but got off obediently on a side street
whitlock went speeding toward coke field and the county
hangar jims decided to walk back out to the field he
chuckled to himself as he went that hunch of his to stop
over in flagstaff was bearing good fruit this bootlegging
business with murphy and whitlock was going to settle
his nerves for a while nothing like a little excitement to
spice the joy of living

  he was still musing over matters when he entered the
quarters he opened the door of his room only to experi-
ence the sudden feeling that he had been abruptly dumped
into a lake of cold water something was wrong and he
knew it the moment he had the door open he closed it

behind him and moved quickly to one side halting waiting
call it a sixth sense or what you will jims knew that danger
lurked in that darkened room minutes ticked away like
hours the very atmosphere tensed to bursting some one
was hiding in his room some one who had no honest bus-
iness being there a man was in that room with designs
on his well-being jims could feel it and wished he had a
revolver he decided that hereafter he would never be
caught without one he changed his position carefully
and waited it seemed hours as eyes strained to pierce the
heavy blanket of darkness ears listened to catch the slight-
est sound

  the pupils of his eyes became accustomed to the dark-
ness of the room objects were showing a shade darker
than the blackness finally there came distinctly the sound
of indrawn breath jims felt rather than saw a large in-
distinct blurr moving toward him in the dark for a mo-
ment he debated whether to fling himself onto the other in a
wild rush or await a decisive movement of the man closing
in on him he was weaponless and had nothing near his
hand which he could use to defend himself in all likeli-
hood the other was armed with a gun

  jims clenched hand in his pocket came in contact with a
metal cigarette lighter he brought it out held it at arms
length and pressed the catch the lighter burst into flames
jims found himself staring into the malevolent features of
kruger and almost touching the hand which held the
cigarette lighter was a leveled colt forty-five

  for one fleeting moment jims and kruger eyed each
other then kruger with a weak smile slipped the
gun into his pocket jims snapped on the light switch near
the door he faced kruger ready to demand a full explana-
tion kruger saw this coming and was wise enough to
take the initiative

  sorry to scare you like i did jims you see i was after
a suspicious character i saw looking in at the office windows
a few minutes ago he was a seedy-looking individual
quite possibly a tramp it just happened that i saw him
and my suspicions were aroused he moved around the
office building trying each window i hurried to my quar-
ters for my gun when i came back the tramp was ap-
proaching the pilots quarters walking in the shadows i
saw him slip into the hallway that was but a moment ago
when he got inside the building i lost sight of him then i
heard a faint noise in your room and came to investigate
i had hardly got in here when you came naturally i
thought you were the tramp and so i waited sorry if i
gave you a scare kruger laughed easily as though dis-
missing the matter as of small importance but jims knew
the eyes of the superintendent were watching him closely
to catch the first faint sign of suspicion jims kept his feel-
ings hidden and answered kruger with a dry chuckle

th admit i was rather worried for a moment finding
- some one inside my room in the dark who wouldnt be
here i bought some good cigars up town have one jims
handed kruger a cigar with docile innocence kruger took
it with thanks and jims almost laughed outright at the smug
smile on krugers face the man believed his explanation
had gone over he even arose and took himself away with-
out further mention of the tramp jims took quick stock
of his room but could see nothing disturbed he went to
bed wondering why kruger had been there

  the next morning he knew jims had a peculiar way
all his own in folding his clothes in placing his letters and
personal papers in his bag those papers and his clothes
had been disturbed it had been a master hand which had
searched his effects everything was placed just as jim
had left it only one man out of a dozen would have
noticed a single detail lacking but jims did he sat down
on his bed thoughtfully and tried to arrive at some reason
why kruger should go through his belongings had the
mans suspicions been aroused in some quarter did he be-
lieve that jims had come to the company seeking work as
above the rainbow



an under cover man sent on detail from the sheriffs office

  at breakfast oneal a short heavy-set pilot told jims he
was to take out his h v ship and follow him to rainbow
bridge oneal had a full party of eastern tourists going up
jims routed out his ground crew and trundled his ship out
to the line the motor was warmed up while he went over
controls jims had never flown an h v but after exam-
ination he discovered it was on the same principle as the
war-time de havilands the other flyers had described
much of the country to jims and he was eager to view it
from the air

  he took off close on oneals tail and the two planes
circled east over the village passing between the peaks and
sunset mountain the frisco peaks glistened with snow
and the scenic beauty of the tall stately pines thrilled jims
they crossed over dead mans flat jims recognized it
from the sage and the low stunted growth of trees after
that came black and red malapi country then grass lands
with grazing herds far to the left the huge bulk of-gray
mountain and white horse mesa showed a meager rib-
bon of silver a bridge and an indian trading post shot by
that was the little colorado river all these things were
beautiful but jims now crossed a country quite beyond im-
agination the painted desert the colored sands distant
mirages now and then indian children herding mixed bands
of sheep and goats and over all this a feeling of immeasur-
able spaces

the planes now verged a little to the east passed over
canyons mesas more waste-lands red rocky country and
flats with navajo mountain showing purple in the distance

  another ship appeared out of the north when it met
jims h v the pilot dipped a wing it was murphy bound
for flagstaff with his passengers jims flew in close to
oneals ship and the two planes crossed around navajo
mountain to the north and east a wild country through
which man and beast passed with great diffculty appeared
below and in a canyon red standstone showing on all
sides oneal dipped his wings and circled jims looked
down and was for a moment speechless with wonder a
great rainbow carved by nature from stone reached out
from one red wall across a small stream its splendor its
glorious beauty were beyond description

  jims followed oneal as his ship turned east and crossed
to a long red flat-topped mesa a landing field and build-
ings appeared below oneal circled and went down jims
followed

  the tourists were turned over to guides and jims was
shown around the landing field

  there was a small machine shop for repairing the planes
a store and a two-story hotel at rainbow field on all
sides jims was surprised at the expense richards had gone
to in order to build up his tourist business oneal assured
him it was a paying proposition rumor had it that richards
had turned down a cold million for his property

after lunch oneal took off for the return trip jims

h	v developed motor trouble he and a mechanic worked
on the motor until nightfall before it would take off the
superintendent at the lodge tried to get jims to wait until
the following morning but as the night was bright jims
decided he would be able to locate landmarks easily be-
sides he wanted to see murphy as soon as possible

  he had covered about half the distance to coke field when
he distinctly heard another plane coming toward him from
the north jims banked and reconnoitered sure enough
there it was a ship with high altitude coming fast red
showed from the exhausts there was no ship left at rain-
bow field jims zoomed for altitude and the next moment
he was surprised to see the other ship zoom also it was
close now jims cut his motor and leveled out the other
ship came on passed over the h v jims nosed upward
a dark helmeted head showed over the cowling jims
waved the pilot did not return the greeting jims zoomed
the h v to higher level the other ship turned west and

hurried away in a few moments it was rapidly disappearing

  jims turned to his original course thoughtfully the
strange plane was fast much faster than the h v he was
piloting and jims had seen distinctly in the bright moon-
light a canvas covercd object bracketed to the cowling
that barreled object was undoubtedly a machine-gun

  at eleven oclock jims reached coke field not knowing
just where murphys room was he decided to wait until
morning to ask about murphy might arouse suspicion
he was awakened in the cold dawn by the roar of a ship on
the field he went to the window and stuck his head out a
ship was warming up on the dead-line tourists in heavy
coats were being seated aboard the plane a man in leather
flying togs looked towards the barracks building at the
corner room which was visible through the alley running be-
tween the hangars it was murphy jims waved his hand
and murphy replied likewise jims watched until murphy
climbed into the cockpit and the chocks were pulled the
plane went roaring down the field up went the tail and
the big passenger ship sailed away over the pines and the
city to disappear in the morning mists

  jims had just settled himself in bed again when there
came a knock on his door at his answer a mechanic in
greasy overalls came in he gave jims a folded piece of
paper when he had gone jims unfolded the note it was
brief and from murphy

  watch out for kruger he is wise to all three of vs

  now what did murphy mean by that it was a warning
of some kind which murphy expected jims to see he is
wise to all three of us that might mean kruger was aware
that jims was working with whitlock and murphy but
confound it jims had an odd feeling that murphy had writ-
ten another meaning in his words

  jims was still attempting to solve murphys queer mes-
sage that morning while he worked on his plane a me-
chanic came out to the hangar where he was and told him
there was a telephone call for him in the office only kru-
ger was in the office he gave jims a smiling good morn-
ing a smile that jims was always interpreting as meaning
something else he picked up the telephone receiver and
answered

  this is the hospital came a feminine voice briskly over
the wire is this mr jims speaking you are wanted here
immediately can you come at once

  yes replied jims hurriedly as he went through the
door he looked back kruger was looking at him unsmil-
ing but in his eyes was a hidden meaning which he veiled
quickly as jims faced him at that moment an odd thought
struck the new pilot

  kruger he said i dont know why but ive a queer
idea you and i have met before  do you know what friend
of mine could be in the hospital

this time kruger did not smile his oily grin he merely
shook his head as he said i cant recall ever seeing
your face before and ive an idea your friend whitlock
is in the hospital

  jims walked over to krugers desk how do you know
whidock is a friend of mine

  who wouldnt know living in this town i know that
you murphy and whitlock were aviators together in france
and made rather a reputation for yourselves you and whit-
lock were decorated twice murphy holds five different med-
als and has the palm to his croix de guerre murphy and
whitlock have many friends here every small boy in this
place knows just what i have told you

  i see said jims slowly im going to tell you some-
thing kruger when i first saw you i took an instant dis-
like to you you know how hate is sometimes instinctive
a lot of suspicious things have happened since but right
now i dont exactly dislike you pity maybe youd call it
and jims did feel just that youd be a hard man to cross
im going to tell you something else both murphy and
whidock saved my life in france murphy several times


flying stories

those two are my buddies id go through hell for them
whitlock is in the hospital probably through dirty work
if anything should happen to murphy or whitlock id kill
the man who was responsible just as quick as i would kill
a mad dog i dont know just what kind of a game murphy
and whitlock have a hand in i do know that the man who
downs them is going to get his mighty damned quick if
your hands are clean you neednt worry about what im say-
ing but if you have a hand in anything concerning them
youd better take a one two look see

  kruger looked into jims eyes without flinching sud-
denly his face fell unmasked he looked years older more
like a tired old man who has seen too much of life then
with a slight cough he turned to his desk and began sort-
ing letters and bills

  jims walked two blocks caught a cruising taxi and was
whisked to the hospital the nurse in the office was wait-
ing for him and without a word led him to a private room
whitlock sat up in bed propped there by pillows one arm
was in a sling and bandages showed through pajamas on his
left side and shoulder

ltello jims said whitlock as his former army pal
took a chair close to the bed they got me right
this time wont be able to stir for some time got me while
i was closing the doors of my garage last night broke my
arm and put two more bullets in my shoulder and side
doctor says he doesnt quite see why i am alive today
know who it was jims asked quietly

  whitlock nodded i wasted all morning deciding whether
i should call you or not it was one man with a high-pow-
ered rifle standing across the street i did not see him well
enough to be sure but just the same i know now murphy
has had a wild theory all along which i didnt believe now
i know he is right here jims take a look at this its a
clue

  whitlock brought out a narrow piece of paper from under
his pillow jims unfolded it and stared perplexed the
paper was about as big as a postcard and had been slipped
into an envelope there was no writing on it only a black
maltese cross exactly the same size as the german iron
cross the background around the cross was a brilliant
red jims looked up at whitlock inquiringly

  dont you recognize it think back to the war brock
a great light of understanding broke on jims during
the last days of the war their squadron had been at deadly
grips with a squadron of fokkers who had painted a bril-
liant scarlet background around the black crosses on their
planes

  good night what has the war got to do with all this
whitlock smiled grimly murphy came to me with a
wild story that there was a german ace from that old enemy
squadron here in flagstaff seeking revenge if you will
remember closely youll recollect that you murphy and i
got more ships of their red squadron than any other men
now here we are all together at one time a story cir-
culated from the enemy that one of us supposed to be mur-
phy had shot down a young lieutenant who was a brother
of the red squadrons commander

  this thing is utterly preposterous broke out jims
why it is absolutely crazy impossible-

  the very words i used when murphy first told it to
me said whitlock but now im ready to believe most
anything i received that piece of paper through the mail
yesterday morning murphy got one at the same time id
not be at all surprised if you got one of the black crosses
with the red background soon

  why-i thought it was the bootleggers who were trying
to get you and murphy i cant figure this out its too
complicated

  you said it avered whitlock and when it is figured
out well find it so simple well wonder how we could be
so dense yet figure it out we must

  jims was looking at whitlock incredulously but he knew

that whitlock and murphy would be the last men on earth
to be taken in by a wild fanciful theory who shot you
who does murphy think this german ace is yet as he
asked he knew he could answer his own questions

  the answer to both is the same said whitlock slowly
kruger

  when jims got back to the airport office only the steno-
grapher was there on inquiry he was informed that
kruger had left nearly an hour before without saying where
he was going in the hangar the ground crews told him that
kruger had taken out a ship and gone up alone murphy
was due back at eleven oclock from rainbow field

  with time to kill jims walked across the field to the
county sheriffs hangar whitlock had told him about the
plane that it was equipped with a synchronized machine-
gun jims found the mechanic putting in time doing odd
jobs the plane was in tip-top condition oiled and fueled to
take the air after rum runners or others at a moments
notice

  murphy did not come in at eleven oclock twelve and
one oclock came without murphy or kruger jims went to
the office and called rainbow field on the phone murphy
had started back at nine kruger had just left the trip
should consume about three hours unless trouble developed
murphy should have been in long ago jims continued to
loaf nervously about the hangars

  the afternoon mail brought jims a thin envelope and when
he opened it he was not at all surprised to find an exact re-
plica of the maltese cross whitlock had shown him jims
went to the office took krugers swivel chair and placed his
feet on top of the desk the stenographer eyed him dis-
dainfully until he removed them some time later at four
oclock a ship landed on the field when it taxied up to
the line kruger descended from the cockpit

  if he was surprised to see jims sitting in his chair he did
not evidence it as he pulled off his flying coat and helmet

  wheres murphy said jims shortly

  isnt he here now said kruger

  no pie should have been back about noon

  he started back alone without any passengers said
kruger i didnt see him as i came south maybe he was
forced down somewhere any phone messages come in
he asked the stenographer and received a negative reply

  maybe we had better send out a couple of ships to
search said kruger

  that wouldnt be a bad idea returned j ims coldly with-
out removing himself from krugers chair one hand was
in his pocket fingering a colt automatic forty-five which
whitlock had given him

  kruger went to the door to call for oneal and mcmul-
len only oneal appeared in answer

  where is mcmullen

tte left early this morning said youd told him he

  --- could have the day off replied oneal

  kruger frowned i told him he could have the morning
off murphy is missing probably forced down somewhere
you take off and tell- kruger broke off and looked at
jims want to go he finished

  jims nodded his head oneal hurried to the hangars to
get his ship ready jims stood up and with his left hand
spread out a slip of paper on the desk

  take a look at that kruger he said

  kruger went to the desk and looked down but so well
was he in control of himself only the barest start of sur-
prise showed he picked it up turned it over in his hand
and laid it tack down when he faced jims he was smiling

  turned artist since the war jims 

  kruger was so sure so certain jims went cold all over
there mounted in him a desire to kill how he overcame
the impulse to jerk out his gun and shoot he did not know
with a bitter laugh he turned on his heel and slammed the
office door behind him oneal was ready to take off he
hailed jims
above the rainbow



  you take the route east of moencopi wash that we
followed yesterday theres two ways to go ill take the
other west of the wash and tuba city

  oneal climbed into the cockpit and his ship went roaring
into the air jims went to the hangar and ordered his plane
trundled out to the line he went over it carefully while
the mechanic and greasehound started the motor thirty
minutes after oneal left jims was in the air he felt no
eagerness to hurry a cold dread was holding him back
kruger and the strange plane with the mounted machine-
gun filled his mind that machine-gun was not there for
ornamentation the man who flew that ship expected to use
it jims could not however connect that ship and gun
plausibly with the rainbow transportation ships it fitted
in with a desperate rum-running gang if the plane was
from the rainbow transportation hangars the machine-gun
would have to be unmounted before it landed on the rain-
bow fields this was not likely unless there were a hidden
field somewhere which the strange pilot used this too was
not likely it was more reasonable to think that the strange
plane had a hangar hidden somewhere in the mountains or
desert it was easier to believe that the pilot came from
the rainbow fields than the ship

jims thundered the h v high over sunset mountain
sped swiftly over dead mans flat and headed directly
into tlfe north over there north of the painted desert he
had felt bad air currents the day before this was a likely
spot in which a ship would encounter difficulties when the
little colorado river and moencopi wash had passed be-
low he descended to lower levels the painted desert was a
gyrating mass of heat waves in the evening sun no life
stirred on the sands a lone black eagle circling low over a
ridge was the only living thing in that desolate beautiful
land

  the painted desert ended jims banked and returned to
search again in the vacant spaces circling flying low he
came again to the edge of the desert where the canyons and
red treeless mesas began over a red gash the h v
struck a bad air pocket and nosed down suddenly with
difficulty jims stopped the plunge just before hitting a sky-
rearing crag and zoomed upward here in this broken
country with the sky full of pockets close search would be
difficult circling low he came to a salt-brush flat in wide
spots the brush had died out and the salty hard-crusted
earth glistened upward in the sun in such a spot a landing
could be made neither would a take-off be difficult

  steadily jims drifted into the north flying low always
searching he came to a wide valley grama-grass cov-
ered the floor like a velvet carpet in this valley natural
monuments reared upward in all manner of fantastic shapes
jims was far off his course now he had heard the other
flyers talk of monument valley and so was able to recog-
nize it there he changed his course west toward the
north end of navajo mountain it was sunset when he
dropped down on the field at rainbow lodge

  he found the superintendent worried no word had yet
been received of murphy oneal had been at the field
reported no luck and after a hasty meal had taken off
again telephone communication had been kept up with
coke field the superintendent said murphy had probably
been forced down somewhere hed walk to an indian
hogan get a horse and ride into the nearest trading post
he told jims of one other flyer who had been forced down
in the painted desert that pilot had walked two days and
two nights before finding a hogan and getting a horse

  jims listened soberly while he ate it was dark when he
had finished had his ship refueled and was in the air again
the moon came up he followed his old course towards
the south always circling as low as he dared hoping if

murphy were able he would build a signal fire surely he
would know that jims would be worried and out searching

  jims was hanging low over the canyon country again
when the roar of another ship came to him he cut the
motor and then opened the gun wide zooming the other
ship was close and coming out of the south he thought
the other might be oneal yet another look showed the
plane was without running lights oneal would have his
wing lights on warily jims went for altitude the other
ship did likewise coming fast at the h v

  a moment later a strange singing went across the wings
of the h v jims saw the stabbing flame from a machine-
gun as he nosed down with a power dive he darted the

h	v up under the other ship and hung there for a moment
so this pilot was gunning for him i jim felt the old war-
time thrill which was quickly dispelled here he was badly
handicapped weaponless the pilot of the other ship
was not an experienced dog-fighter had the situation
been reversed jims could have brought the unarmed ship
down quickly that the pilot did have some fighting experi-
ence however was soon evident he dropped with an
immelmann roll and shot back at the h v in a twinkling
jims blood went cold bullets flayed the wings the cowl-
ing splintered just as jims dove out of range from the
earlier nights experience he knew the stranger had the
faster ship dark blotches of clouds were drifting across
the bright moonlight sky jims maneuvered higher and
toward those clouds drawing the other ship after him his
only hope was to reach the clouds and slip in

  the other ship hung on tenaciously fighting the weapon-
less ship it was not necessary to cover up but he was
after a man who had outwitted out-maneuvered and out-
fought the best german aces jims drew on all his knowl-
edge of air fighting to save his life now he soon dis-
covered that the other pilot was afraid the two ships would
crash together when they were close and he quickly took ad-
vantage of it he was on the others tail over him under
him in rapid maneuvering jims made the other pilot be-
lieve he was deliberately setting about to crash and take his
enemy to death with him the man was nervous in the air
too nervous to make a good fighter jims also knew that
a single burst at the right moment from the other ship would
send him down he took desperate chances in attempting
to get close enough to see the other pilot all he could see
was the helmeted head of the other above the cowling

  all the time the planes were reaching the ceiling the
heavy cloud now was close a moment came when the
moving mass was between them and the moon and in the
shadows jims swung into the cloud with all possible speed
bullets swept into the crate of the h v as it disappeared

hen he came through the feathery mists he banked
north instead of south cut his motor and listened the
roar of the other ship was flung back by the wind he
banked south then and passed again into the cloud in the
clear air once more he cut the motor listened and searched
the sky for red exhaust the other ship was gone

  he dropped low over the earth hoping that if murphy
were down in that wild unbroken country he would have
set a signal fire to that one hope he clung the canyon
country was now nothing but black precipices and deep-
shadowed labyrinths

  jims came to the salt-brush flat and recognized it because
the moonlight glistened and gleamed on the open salt lands
as it did during the day he passed over it in circles and
where the painted desert began banked and returned that
salt-brush flat drew him like a lodestone

  he caught his breath suddenly ahead just at the edge
of the pinon trees where the canyon country began a red
tongue of flame leaped into the sky

thrills and suspense until with a stirring climax the tangled threads of intrigue are un-
raveled dont miss the second and last instalment of this gripping tale

arthur j burks

she couldn t d ecide jfhich of the
love-mad pilots to many
xjntil they raced into the jungle to rescue her

ood lord shep tex 

  wed all been sitting there and i for one
and sis tex and shep for the other three
had been looking into the east toward the
landing field of parris island above which
one of the battiest fliers i had ever seen was doing his
stuff

  loops spins nose dives falling leafs immelmanns
wing-overs and-well i dont begin to know em all and
maybe there werent any names for most of the things
bugs snelling was doing i knew as did the other
three that the flyer over that field was bugs snelling
no one else ever did the stunts he did

  that said shep duncan is what i call flying thats
the sort of thing i want to do

  wait i cautioned for that bird to land ever
watched him he always lands the same way ending his
flying day by giving the neighbors a treat see there
he comes

  bugs was flying a monoplane a light pursuit tiiat was
faster than  am when im scared every afternoon i had
watched him land and he had a habit of coming into the
field lightning-fast diving under the telephone line which
paralleled one side of the field id watched him every

      

evening as aforesaid and whether i was hoping hed
break his neck is nobodys business anyway id always
watched him-and wondered how long he would last

  well he banked away around and came in as usual
lying like a bat out of dantes masterpiece diving down
to swoop under those wires and over the concrete road
into the huge field

  gosh those wires looked low not much clearance and
a barbed wire fence still lower down close flying but
bugs snelling had made it a hundred times or more to my
knowledge

  but somehow this time maybe because both shep dun-
can and tex mccullough were going to take up this
sport i watched with new interest and all of us fell silent
as snelling came in

  closer and closer he came to the telephone line lower
and lower dropped his trucks nothing much after all
hed make it this time as hed made it a hundred times
before we all got the idea at the same time and relaxed
our tension sitting back again in our chairs

  then a gust of wind did something to bugs just as
he would have zipped under the wires as usual he was
shot up into the air as though he had hit a dip in a tobag-
gan slide his trucks traveling at a hundred and forty
miles an hour hooked onto the wires and bugs turned
over on his nose in the batting of an eyelash he dived
right into that concrete road on the other side of the line

  now i maintain that when an airplane dives into a
concrete road at that many miles per hour and from a
height of thirty feet or so it hits like the devil and then
some at least bugs did

  well believe it or not bugs ship was a wreck the
biggest piece left of it could have been used handily for
a toothpick and as for bugs   

  well bugs had made his last dive under telephone
wires unless they have telephones and airplanes in heaven-
and was gathered in on the marine corps parris island
supply of blotters

  shep looked at tex i looked at shep and tex shep
and tex looked at me this was their out theyd put
in for aviation and their papers probably hadnt left their
respective offices yet all they had to do to renege was
to get their papers and heave em into the waste-basket
after the safety-first precaution of tearing them to bits

  but next day those two saps left for wherever they
were going to get their wings four months later i was
ordered to santo domingo and took sis with me

  we had a nice house in gascue with nigger servants
and such plenty of good drinks-all soft drinks of course-
and had grown to like it breakfast at nine oclock

  out of the west there suddenly came the blasting
roar of a low-flying ship i dashed out i knew already
what was what though for shep had preceded me to
santo domingo and id heard enough about his stunting

to know it probably was he besides this low flying over
the city was against orders which was why shep being
that sort of a buzzard was doing just that

  sis and i ran out

  shep was certainly putting on a show a burro hazed
along by a native woman and piled high with market
stuff was trudging down the road toward us she looked
back as the motor blasted in her ears then started to run
but too late as the titles say the burro only wagged
his ears unconcerned like not knowing what was coming
not all the burros in santo domingo had as yet been
trained by shep duncan

shep tilted his de haviland up in the air and gave
her the gun right over the old woman and her burro
the old womans clothes flew up over her head and she
squatted in the road as though an armored tank had run
over her covered by her clothes like a tent the burro
took to his heels and jobos mclones mainey apples pa-
latas chicharrones every marketable thing the burro
bore was scattered from here to there as though a hurri-
cane had done it

  but shep wasnt worried by the time the woman had
decided that the judgment day hadnt arrived after all
shep had touched his wheels to the flat roof of our house
and had ducked on over the city his wheels spinning mad-
ly his ship was careening from side to side he-well-
he flew like a crazy man

  we got to the roof by a ladder and watched shep go
winging his way thence we stood upright on the roof




flying stories

in the dust of which we had caught a glimpse of the trace
of his wheels and watched him go over the ozama he
had banked left flying close to die water as we knew be-
cause we couldnt see him for a moment

  then he came into sight climbing straight up grabbing
for altitude with his prop-and we knew and gasped as
the knowledge came home to us that hed flown under the
bridge which spanned the river where he had somediing
like three feet of clearance for his wings

  just before we went down from the roof we saw an-
other ship which was so far away almost straight over
us that we could scarcely hear the engine that flyer
had so much altitude that he could have been married
and divorced before his ship could have struck the ground
in a tight spin

  that sis i said is tex mccullough safe and sane
flyer always believes in having gliding radius down
here where fields are few and far between

  sis was a bit thoughtful as we climbed down the lad-
der and went into the house then sis delivered her
bombshell

t ook bud she told me i love both of those
boobs so help me but im not sure i like a fraid
cat as a husband same time early widowhood doesnt
appeal to me i want you to take rides with each of those
fellows and let me know what you think about it

  but sis i said suddenly having visions of ships fall-
ing ten miles in flames or crashing into the steel trusses
of bridges i thought you told me once you preferred to
manage your own affairs

  i do says the kid sister im doing it youre one
of my means to an end

  the way she said end somehow stuck in my craw
but well did you ever have a persistent kid sister

  next day i hopped to macoris with shep duncan on
trumped up official business while sis waited at the field
for me to come back which i had doubts about doing ill
pass over that ride speedily

  we took the hats off seven natives riding burros spun
our trucks on four subanas each the size of a handker-
chief with trees a hundred feet high walling them all
around flew along the road with altitude of something
under three feet blew smoke back down the huge chim-
neys of three sugar refineries dropped into the macoris
field over telephone wires so close to em that they
hummed like jews-harps after we had passed-sfact i
heard em above the roaring of the motor-did our
business took off for the return under those wires climb-
ing straight up right alongside the poles replaced the
hats on the heads of six out of seven of the natives on the
way back-the seventh saw us coming and ducked-
sucked the smoke back up the chimneys of the three sugar
refineries flew along the road upside down touched those
four fields still upside down while shep kicked up dirt by
hitting the ground with his helmet as we passed over and-
well isnt that long enough for one sentence

  when i stepped out of the de haviland-think of it
a de haviland-at the home field  had lost exactly fifty
pounds was perspiring like a black man in a dominican
election campaign and my knees were knocking together
so badly that the mechanic kept the motor of the ship
revved up to kill the sound and save me embarrassment

  sis i choked sis if you feel yourself slipping
where this bird shep is concerned shoot him before it
gets too serious and save us both a lot of worry and
trouble

  but sis only looked enigmatical and informed me that
she had it all arranged for me to fly to azua with tex
mccullough that the other ship on the field idling at the
blocks had simply been waiting for me to arrive

  well i refused pointblank   

  of course i went a kid sister you know

  in wide spirals tex lifted that old de haviland
honest i never realized that riding in an airplane could
be so comfortable like riding on granddaddys rocking-
chair at home the field below kept getting smaller and
smaller further and further away but tex watching his
instruments looking over first one side and then the
other kept climbing until i thought wed starve to death
before he pointed her nose at azua when he did do so
the altimeter said twelve thousand which was eleven
thousand eight hundred feet higher than id ever been
before

  but i loved it we sailed along like loves young dream
piles of clouds were everywhere as soon as we got into
the cordilleras holes in the clouds down to earth looked
like wells a hundred miles deep with little cigar-box
houses at the bottoms of em the sun was shining and
those clouds sure looked pretty

  then the bottom fell out of the atmosphere we must
have dropped five hundred feet while my safety belt al-
most cut my legs in two and i pinched two huge hunks
out of the cowling of my pit but tex unbothered ex-
amining his instruments like an automaton caught her up
again and flew on

  i was thinking with shep flying at an elevation of
something under ten feet a sudden drop of five hundred
feet might have spelled disaster but well shep hadnt
dropped

  then we hit another bump or kiss-me-quick or hole in
the road or something and the right wing fell plumb
square off at least for a minute i thought it had only
it hadnt it was pointing at the earth but wasnt going
there rather the whole plane was but it was still intact

  we must have flown on the edge of that hole for a
quarter of a mile with our right wing pointing at the
ground nine or ten miles more or less down there at the
bottom of those wells somebody had dug in the clouds

  and all the time tex sat there like a dummy manip-
ulated this and manipulated that until he finally straight-
ened her out and got going again

  then we reached azua still the dummy in the pit tex
dropped his left wing and started down in a screaming
side slip which had me glued to the upper side of my pit
with mucilage which was the stickiest  had ever experi-
enced-probably much of it compounded of my own per-
spiration

  he leveled nosed over went into a power dive leveled
side slipped again while the houses in azua got so big
with such suddenness that they looked as though some-
body was blowing them up like kids blow up those toy
balloons you buy at county fairs any moment i looked
for em to burst with a loud report

  then i saw the cemetery right under our feet after a
manner of speaking and was just thinking how handy
we would be for planting if anything went wrong when
tex dropped the de havilands wheels over the top of
the cemetery wall and set the ship down

i shudder to think how site would have come into
this field if tex was a safe and sane flyer

  listen bud said tex just before i pulled the prop
for the return airs kind of light here worst field in
the republic you know but if we go clear to the end of
the field i figure well clear the cemetery wall by exactly
six inches lets go

  well the dummy flyer had it guessed about right when
we were within forty feet of that wall-which was two
feet thick and made of bricks or stones i didnt get out to
ascertain which-our trucks were still glued to the ground

  i swear that at the last moment tex raised up in the
pit and gave a sort of upward heave with his whole body
in order for us to clear that wall which we did by just
those six inches he had guessed at if not less blew the
fur the wrong way on the backs continued on page

-w w hat was your most exciting experience in
 a  the air i was asked the other day i
have had my share of the adventures that
 t go to make flying the spice of life but
just as we can never forget the joy of our
first speeding train or automobile or motor-boat so i can
safely say that getting lost on my first license-test flight
gave me my greatest thrill

  oddly enough i not only had a glorious time that day
some three and a half years ago but i found that feminine
pilotswith long hair are better prepared for some emer-
gencies of flying than are short-haired pilots of either sex
i resolved after that high adventure never again to fly
without a hairpin

  it was all due to the very well-known london fog be-
tween august   when we organized the first london

                                                


flying stories

 light airplane club and the following october i had
 had ten hours of instruction i could perform various
 stunts and had the necessary amount of flying one and one-
 half hours to apply for my a license i was the first
 member of the club to try for it and on october th i
 went up for my test flight if i succeeded i would be the
 first woman to hold an a license

     in my little de haviland moth i speedily went through
  the first test cutting five figures-of-eight at  feet ele-
  vation other tests
  followed then i was
  to go up to  feet
  and glide down to a
  landing within fifty
  feet of a mark all
  was going well-i
  could just see that
  license with my name
  written on it

    it was a little misty
  when i started up but
  that gave me little
  concern but by the
  time i was a mile
  high the ground was
  quite invisible still
  i went on for all was
  clear above after i
  had gone through a
  bank of clouds

  reaching the required
  ceiling i decided
  to come down the
  quickest way - by
  stalling my plane and
  dropping

   i went into a spin
 and came swiftiy
 down like an eagle
 dropping on its prey

 but when t could
 finally see the ground
 a few hundred feet
 beneath my straining
 eyes i realized that i
 was over strange ter-
 ritory

   with map or com-
 pass i could have been
 home in five minutes

  but i had neither for
  i was supposed to
  keep within three
  miles of the air-
  drome so all i could
  do was to cruise
  around-at about 
  feet hoping to catch
  a glimpse of the field

 unfortunately my one
 hope of getting back
 quickly-the sun-had
 by now gone behind a
 thick bank of clouds

    i was still looking anxiously over the side for my lost
  airdrome when suddenly one of the four cylinders stopped
  firing the small engines pover was so much reduced that
  i knew i must land at once and fix it

    my littl plane would land in a tennis court if necessary
  so i did not worry about landing soon i was gliding
  safely to earth on an open plot i was not overjoyed to
  find that i was miles from home

    i had to make a connection in the ignition system here
  is where long hair would have been a decided asset but

  i was able to borrow a crinkly hairpin trom a country girl
  who was deeply interested in my plane and its lost pilot
  soon i had the engine going agajn i hopped off easily
  feeling greatly delighted with my first mechanical efforts
  strictly on my own

   but hardly more than a hundred feet in the air the
 engine cut out completely i had started off before it had
 warmed up silently i glided down and landed once more
 in a field only sixty feet wide once more i got my engine

                                    purring then i dis-
                                    covered that there was
                                    no room to take off
                                    motorists in a nar-
                                    row lane have been
                                    in as bad a fix

                                      but just the other
                                    side of a fence i
                                    noted was a much
                                    larger field so i
                                    adopted an expedient
                                    which the unlucky
                                    motorist cannot get-
                                    ting up just enough
                                    speed i did a hop
                                    skip and jump over
                                    the fence into more
                                    commodious pastures
                                    having obtained some
                                    rather vague direc-
                                    tions such as country
                                    people sometimes of-
                                    fer the stranded air-
                                    man i took the air
                                    once more serenely
                                    headed for home as i
                                    supposed

                                very soon i saw
                              my mistake i was
                              hopelessly lost in a
                              strange land or if i
                              was not lost the land-
                              ing field certainly
                              was worst of all it
                              was beginning to get
                              dark there was noth-
                              ing for me to worry
                              about i reassured
                              myself but i knew
                              the instructor would
                              be getting very much
                              disturbed perhaps
                              not so much on my
                              account but because
                              i was flying just one
                              half of the clubs en-
                              tire equipment of ma-
                              chines 

                                      two planes are not
                                    any too many for a
                                    hundred people who
                                    are eager and even
                                    anxious to learn fly-
                                    ing i began to vision
                                    the consternation of
                                    my friends as they discussed my certain crash and their
                                    hopes thereby sadly delayed

   as i flew across the country gazing over the side at
 intervals i reflected that the clubs rules especially pro-
 hibited cross-country flights but i really did not mean 
 to break that sensible rule on my very first solo yet i did
 want to fly back home in triumph

   eventually which was very soon as more unfamiliar
 country fell away into the dusk i decided that discretion
 was very much the better part of piloting so i chose a

r

the sky-line of
lady heaths career

       che was the first woman to reach the
        altitude of  feet a record for ight
       planes later accompanied by a passe- iger
       she set a new altitude record for bi itish
       seaplanes july   reaching the
       altitude of  feet

          she was the first woman to gain a license
        to carry passengers and the first to carry
        passengers on a regular air route she was
        second pilot with the royal dutch air
        service operating an air line between
        amsterdam and paris

        lady heath has carried about 
       passengers without an accident she was
       the first pilot to fly across africa covering
       over  miles from capetown to london
       without an accident and with the same
       lane on one day during this flight she
       ew for ten and a half hours covering 
       miles at another time she flew 
       miles between  am one day and
        pm the next day

         she was the first woman to be a com-
       mercial pilot and is not only a licensed
       pilot but a licensed mechanic as well

         a few months after she became the first
       woman member of the london light
       airplane club lady heath traveled with
       a stunt circus giving daring exhibitions
       of aerobatics she has engaged in numer-
       ous air races and has done every sort of
       aerial stunt from barrel rolling looping
       nose diving spinning and parachute
       jumping
thrills i have

had in the air



nice hospitable-looking country home and glided for an
open field nearby

  as soon as i had landed i made haste to call up the
flying field i asked my flying instructor if he would be
so good and kind and helpful as to light flares on the field
thereby i assured him i could make a night flight straight
to the home nest

t ut he promptly declined my request and i could hardly
- blame him for deciding that i had had enough excite-
ment and experience for one day im sure i heard a long
sigh of relief when  reported that my little moth was all
in one piece and  know he did me the honor of assum-
ing that i was likewise but i was quite ready to fly home

  the people at my personally selected airdrome were
perfectly charming leaving my machine in their care for
the night  took the train for home when we got the
plane back next day-i had landed just eighteen miles from
the flying field-it showed not the slightest damage but
i had to make another try for my a license

  my disappointment in that was more than made up by
iiit confidence i had gained in myself in my machine and
in the knowledge that the instruction i had received would
equip me for any emergency it had been a delightful
experience

  there was nothing to be afraid of as i had perfect con-
fidence in my little plane i decided then that there should
be room in the commercial world for at least one woman
who flew because she loved to fly i thought it did not
lake half so much nerve as driving a motor-car in crowded
streets

   determined to become an aerial taxi driver and be-
cause there was no woman then licensed to do that my
task proved more difficult than i had dreamed

  a few weeks after my solo adventure i obtained my
a license having performed all the required aviation and

aerobatic tests i now had my official certificate of com-
petence to fly any type of machine i was now free to take
any trusting friend upstairs-my license guaranteed that
he or she was reasonably safe in so doing

  next i resolved to go after a b license which no
woman then held this would entitle me to carry passen-
gers for hire-be a regular buswoman of the skyways
alas for my fond hopes

  i was amazed to learn for the first time that the inter-
national air navigation commission which controlled the
issuing of licenses for inter-country passenger and freight
pilots had haid a heavy ban on women pilots even mile
adrienne bolland famous french pilot who had been
carrying passengers for two years in her own commercial
plane was compelled to cease flying people for hire

  even if i succeeded in becoming the first woman to obtain
the b license i learned  could not accept pay for
carrying a single passenger but i was then so much in
love with aerial transport that i decided to become an air-
taxi pilot at any cost i could always carry my friends
for fun-and i knew there were jobs to be obtained in
stunting or on the experimental and administrative side

t hoped to prove that a healthy woman properly
trained is as reliable in the air as a man i determined
to open the doors of civil aviation to women i would prove
that women could drive planes just as they had made good
at driving motor-cars after the men had scoffed

  it was a bumpy course  had set for myself but we can
go a long way when we have the will my first solo ad-
venture had proved that there was nothing but flying for
me i have climbed mountains and scaled cliffs hunted
the most savage wild beasts of africa chased whales in
cold northern seas i have had the honor of taking part
in olympic and other international games and i know die
joys of scurrying after the hounds during the war i was

lady heath beside the plane in which she bew about  miles across africa from capetown to london
id a later issue she will tell you all about that trip


flying stories

motor dispatch rider for the royal air corps

  but no sport nor profession compares for delightful thrills
with flying no other pursuit is so constantly giving you
something new to think about no man or woman can
possibly be bored with traveling in the air-if he or she
is piloting his own ship

  experienced pilots know that when you have had from
ten to twenty hours of flying you begin to think you know
all about the air world and its ways your machine
responds to your slightest wish automatically you balance
yourself on the air waves you take off and land like a
veteran and this is about the time when you have the
world at your feet that you are due for something to
happen

  what you need is a little shock to jar your idle sense of
caution into action and youre quite sure to have an ex-
perience which will be exceedingly useful to your future
career in the air perhaps you would like to hear about
my little episode after about twenty hours of varied flying

  i was giving an exhibition of stunt-flying at winchester
talking on the field with an army pilot we got into an
argument as to the best thing to do when the engine cuts
out immediately after
or during the take-
off i maintained that
instead of going back
you should go straight
on heedless of the
risk of a spin sud-
denly i said

  ill show you

  i whirled my pro-
peller the engine then
fired i hopped into
die cockpit and up i
went to show him how
safely i could do a
low flat turn

  instead i succeeded
in getting into a beau-
tiful flat tail spin only
eighty feet above the
ground there is no
more likely maneuver
from which to origi-
nate a crash

  i had then no in-
stinctive knowledge as
to what i should do
in such a case but
something told me to
open the throttle wide
and work my controls
correcdy

 my machine re-
sponded nobly we
dived out of the
spin-but so close to
earth was the bottom
of my dive that i
neatly clipped off the
top of a rose-bush in
a private garden

  once we were on
a level keel i had to
fly around for about

  being dressed up
  in a sidcot suit
  for hex erst para-
  chute descent -
  a clumsy but es-
  sential outt

a quarter of an hour before i could pluck up enough cour-
age to land and face those white-faced pilots poor dears
they were a great deal more scared than i was as they stood
and watched my weird demonstration of course i never
had that happen again it should never occur to a properly
broken-in pilot

safety has come so swiftly and silently to aviation that
many do not realize how really free from hazards aerial
travel has become beginners are taught to make automatic
and subconscious movements for every possible condition
encountered in the air i recall an amusing experience with
lady bailey with all the thrills one could desire it serves
to illustrate this point
i was giving flying lessons to lady bailey the brave little
pilot you remember who recently made die long and ar-
duous circuit of aerial africa her husband disapproved
of her flying so each morning i used to- call for her
dressed in white and carrying a tennis racket the family
thought we were practising to beat helen wills and mile
lenglen instead of colonel lindbergh and his comrades
of the air lady bailey decided not to tell them about her

higher aims until she
knew how to pilot a
ship it saved so much
debating

  after i had given
her about five hours of
instruction i thought
she should learn how
to get out of a tail
spin i took her up to

	feet and then ex-
plained to her what it
meant to get into a
spin and how easily
she could come out of
it through the speak-
ing-tube i instructed
throttle right back
then when the ma-
chine is going as slowr
ly as possible pull the
stick hard back and
give full left rudder
she nodded and pro-
ceeded to follow or-
ders thereupon it
being a cold day and
the pilot jet too finely
set the engine stop-
ped completely  it
was a dual-control
plane of course

  i took the stick and
dived at  miles an
hour to restart the en-
gine it was no use i
dived again at 
no use i dived at
-and still no kick
from that cold-hearted
engine

  by that time we
were about  feet
above the ground it
was time to pick out
the best place for a
forced landing the
only field within reach
was down wind and
was well sprinkled
with cattle and other
obstacles however i
thrills i have had in the air



daring the war lady heath was a despatch rider for the royal flying corps

i was fortunate enough to effect a really happy landing
but by the grace of god we came to earth safely missing
by inches or feet some thirty cows twenty sheep three trees
a drain and a sheep-fold

  as we clambered out of the machine charming lady bailey
turned to me and said innocently

  but why did you stop dear 

less than two years later she was so expert that she
flew over  miles of african jungles with but two
forced landings and no damage to her own fair person

  but the rest of the story is the best i was dumfounded to
discover that the machine had been newly fitted with a self-
starter i could easily have used it in mid-air even the
cows blushed at my remarks when i saw that wretched
starter glinting at me in the sunlight

  forced landings are rarely hazardous to the careful pilot
you are taught urged reminded and ordered from the very
beginning to keep a landing ground within gliding distance
even if you have to go somewhat out of your course to keep
near one this is no more unreasonable than for a distance-
swimmer to keep within easy distance of a buoy or boat or
for a motorist to keep a weather eye on gas stations tire-
repair shops garages and hot-dog stands

  at the start of my flying life i found that men were dis-
couraging women from learning how to fly there are some
today-happily only a few-who think women cannot make
good safe pilots remember the uproar only a few years
ago about women driving automobiles and motorcycles
those days are gone forever and that applies to aviation
too

  perhaps this attitude of conservative man is due to his
inherited habit of protecting the sex which once was con-

sidered the weaker but the final test of safety is in the
insurance which the pilot can obtain and there are a num-
ber of women pilots who rank quite as high as the best men
in freedom from accidents-which means insurability

  but when i started for my commercial license insurance
for women pilots was quite unheard of i shall never forget
my difficulty in getting insured for the first time or what
followed the tragi-comic experience served to further re-
duce my bump of overestimation

  as soon as i had finally decided to become an aerial taxi-
driver three weeks after receiving my a license i resigned
as secretary of the ladies atheneum a society club in lon-
don then i enrolled at the de haviland air school for a
three months course to qualify as a passenger-carrying
pilot i had to learn all about navigation the motor and the
machine so that i could make long and wearying trips over
land and water

t had to study meteorology to know whether my ship was
likely to run into a storm and cause discomfort to the
passengers there were the flying rules of various countries
to learn i had already passed an oral examination in lights
and signals and traffic regulations it doesnt take long
to cross a european state in a -mile-ari-hour ship and
each nation has its own traffic rules of the air

  then i had to know all about fixing my own engine which
means a great deal more than cleaning spark-plugs and using
a hairpin for a connector i alsd had to get into the best
possible physical condition for on this depends the lives of
passengers and safety of the ship

  i received ground lectures and flying instruction in every-
thing a pilot should know from astronomy and instruments
to engines and rigging after all these tests liad been passed


flying stories

i had to make a night flight of thirty minutes or more at

 feet as well as a cross-country flight of  miles

  the latter test i made in april  being in the air about
five hours altogether and breaking my journey twicc for
meals it was a thoroughly nice trip and i did not hurry
enjoying myself every minute

  i passed the physical examination with forty-four marks
out of a maximum of fifty most male pilots pass at about
forty-five my years of athletics of course had helped me to
maintain the high standards required in one test i had to
stand on one foot for a long time and also hold my breath
as long as i could-no doubt in anticipation of a transatlantic
plunge

the physical tests were really not difficult being designed
merely to insure that those flying above cities and towns

should not throw a fit or collapse from heart failure and thus
endanger those below as well as in the plane in may 
the international air navigation commission in effect lifted
the ban on women pilots arranging to qualify all who passed
the medical tests to pilot passengers for hire to fly taxiplanes
and commercial air expresses

  i was now ready to apply for insurance so essential for
moral effect and for actual protection of passengers and
property but the companies were very loath to insure a
woman my many hours in the air without accident did not
impress them a bit apparently

  but at last after much persuasion they granted me a three
months policy even then they were taking no more
chances than necessary for the rate was made very high
however to encourage me in playing safe they promised to
rebate one-half the premium if i had no crash within the three
months

  meanwhile i had joined an aviation company and had an
interesting job doing stunts at various provincial centers i
looped the loop did various spins rolled banked and nose-
dived also made parachute drops i had a glorious time for
three months and did a tremendous amount of flying the day
before my probation period was up

i was still safe and sound my plane was undamaged and i
felt very much pleased with myself what could possibly

happen now-to me so i wired the hard-hearted insurance
people now wdiat about it hurry up with that refund

  next day the last day of grace which i must safely pass
before i would get one-half of my heavy premium back i
had to take my little machine out of a grassy meadow my
engine was only twenty-seven horsepower

  the english rain-only englishmen can fully appreciate
it-had been falling for four days the machine from wings
to wheels was waterlogged the long grass was a swamp

  however i decided to go up-alone i declined to take
any chances with a passenger i have never deviated from
this rule and as a result have never had an accident not
even punctured a tire with any of the thousands i have car-
ried aloft how many auto-drivers can duplicate this

i had then about  hours of air experience behind me

having flown steadily
almost every day for
some six months i
started my engine
warmed it up and fin-
ally was tearing down
the meadows slippery
slopes at sixty miles
an hour

there was no room
in the small field to
stop or to turn and
too late i realized that
i would never get off
the long wet grass
was wrapping itself
around the axle great-
ly slowing up my
speed as well as drag-
ging my machine
down

  i made straight for
the fence across the
end of the meadow
and hit it head on or
as we used to say-
for-six the ma-
chine turned complete-
ly over on her back

                                     as i hung suspend-
ed from my safety-belt
before i even thought
of getting myself out
i composed a short
but stirring ode to the insurance company-the lucky dogs
hanging head downward in my crashed machine i had
a television picture of them in london as they got my
second message of the day so different from my cocksure
one

i was not even scratched but there was some damage to
the plane and i was considerably hurt in feelings and
bank account those early crashes taught me to avoid risks
and showed me how to make flying safe for those who fly
with me either as pupils or as passengers i have always
carried insurance on myself and machine since then for i
eventually convinced the companies that i was as good a
risk as other pilots

  i had many ideas to correct as we all do when we enter
the air world slow speeds in motoring for instance al-
most always make for safety-except perhaps in a fast
stream of traffic but in the air the faster one goes the
greater the support to the wings i had to learn by ex-
perience that speed and control fly wing-to-wing especial-
ly is this true in the take-off when accidents are most likely
to occur to the green pilot

  it was while i was taking a plane to an international
light plane competition in belgium in  that i had
one of my most thrilling demonstrations of the relation of

natives in east africa putting up an impromptu hangar for lady heaths plane
during one of her few brief visits on the trip
thrills  have have had in the air



examining the barograph before going up for her first attempt at the altitude record in
may  the barograph is an altitude recorder

speed to control in a take-off i was hopping off from a
field well known for its peculiar wind currents close to the
hangars

  j had only just left the ground and was skimming along
hardly two or three feet above it much too soon to have
lateral control when i was caught by a freak wind from one
side it threw the machine completely out of my hands

  we headed at full speed straight for a gasoline dump on
the field i had only a fraction of a second to decide what
to do but i managed in that time to switch off both

ignition and gas so when we did hit there was no danger
of fire it wasnt a bad crash and it taught me the neces-
sity of quick pick-up at the very start to guard against
the vagaries of playful breezes

  the biggest thrill in flying of coarse is in racing skim-
ming along in a powerful machine some twenty feet off
the ground well out of the winds hopping over hedges and
turning and banking around the trees is the greatest sport
mankind has yet discovered one such race i shall never
forget though i have flown in continued on page

  nobody suspected the identity of the
  strange passengern concealed itv the plane until-

ometimes it takes a properly directed kick to
make a fellow enjoy a soft seat yours truly got
 such a boot and as a result directed the worlds
ily most thrilling airplane mystery animal picture

        the mystery of the hidden pilotas you will find
is the most hair-raising movie marvel ever sold to the public
at fifty cents and up per portion and it was all an accident

  you see i got into die news reel business and considerable
trouble after having been sacked as a director for die
glimmer films corporation it seems that i lost my temper
and did serious things to a third cousin of j jason jessup
the producer this cousin an oaf who had been inflicted
upon the world with the title of hymie garfinkle thought he
was an actor whereas i couldnt give him credit even for
thinking such a situation was bound to result in trouble
sooner or later and die sooner the better for me

  when jessup unloaded the cluck on me he gave me in-
structions to do something with him at first sight of the
offensive beak and the shiny black petroleum-plastered
hair i knew diat if i did what i wanted to do with him
id never get anywhere in life they hang men for that
even in california

  at first i used him as background in scenes where he
had only to stand around and look stupid he was a success
at that becausc he stayed in character this perfect arrange-
ment didnt last long before die blow-up came the lad
came to me one day and said he had been crying on his

cousins shoulder and that mr jessup didnt think his
family was being done right by after that time he said
he was going to take leading roles in plays which i was
going to direct furdiermore he said that the pictures
were going to be diose he would write himself besides
diat he informed me id better not argue because hed get
his cousin to fire me on account of i wasnt much good
anyway

  holding my temper and wishing to know how near hymie
had approximated the process of thinking i invited him to
explain what type of pictures he was going to make

tphe idea diat was rattling around in the vacant spaces
of the lads sconce was worthy of the peanut brain that
had evolved it in brief hymie was going to impersonate
animals he had gone into a huddle with himself and de-
cided that the world was waiting for a man who could por-
tray the emotions and inner thoughts of dogs tigers elk
polecats and other dumb beasts if all the ideas that boy
had nursed were placed end to end dicy would have reached
deep into the pit of inanity but this one took the prize

  my uncle is behind me in this he asserted

  he couldnt be i said youre at die end of the
parade now perhaps you could make a fairly decent double
for old joe our trained ape

  thats just it he came back enthusiastically ill take
the part of an ape and make a human being out of him




flying stories

  whats the use in trying to insult a baby like that how-
ever i tried once more

  nature i said has already taken a human being and
made a monkey out of him the best you could do is try
and imitate a man

  fine he said i will imitate a monkey trying to
imitate a man

  then i socked him im telling you i socked him seri-
ously and scientifically if i had known then what part
that oaf and his addle-pated ideas were going to play in
my life it would have been murder instead of mayhem i
committed

  anyway jessup gave me the gate the old man was
decent but he was deluded into the idea that he owed his
cousin some sort of a debt on account of family affairs
sometime in the past i couldnt land as director anywhere
else what with the industry going screwy over the talkies
and me being knowm as being too ready to make anatomi-
cal alterations in higher officials who made me angry

  as a result i got into the news reel business i hocked
the automobile and the cocktail shaker drew the reserve
from the bank and bought a plane then i hired joboneau
webster one of californias best pilots and natures mas-
terpiece in the way of white men he wasnt so big nor
good-looking but he was real people when i was broke
and couldnt pay his wages he stuck through friendship
together we filmed cataclysms disasters parades and other
tilings inflicted upon the fair state of california

  we got the first shot of the wreck of the parrot off the
coast of mexico and did some good work on the santa fe
springs oil-well fire the webster boy was a valuable asset
to my business i was free-lancing selling my stuff to the
regular news reel companies to do that i had to get my
stuff in ahead of the others or get exclusive shots thats
where webster came in hed take more chances than the
other pilots he darned near singed the wings off the
plane on the oil-fire shot and he bucked a god-awful gale
to get the shipwreck film

  it was a tough battle and i always had a sneaking desire
to go back into the directing business but there was cash
on hand most of the time jessup met me on the street
once and offered to take me back if id direct that family
affliction of his in a picture i turned it down what the
movies lost the news reel business gained life is that way

  however when tilings are rolling along fairly smoothly
fate usually punctures a tire by way of letting a fellow
know life isnt all banana sherbet thats what the lady did
to my news reel business just when business started to
get good and nature had allowed us a couple of forest fires
with another shipwreck thrown in as a bonus webster
my pilot goes and gets afflicted with love

  i noticed the symptoms in webster while we were flying
over a football game at the pasadena bowl the plane was
riding smoothly and i was cranking away at my camera
the boys below got all tangled up with themselves and i
had the whole business in focus then the ship went crazy
it first went into a tail spin and then nosed upward again
after that it flopped over on its back

  i wondered if theyd spell my name right in the death
notice and tried to figure things out at first i thought a
wing had been washed out but i soon knew that that was
not the case on account of we were still up in the air
there seemed to be no immediate danger of falling but i
wasnt enjoying myself to any great degree i never did
trust a life-belt

  finally i put my hand on the stick in front of me it
moved freely deciding that webster had fainted or some-
thing i realized that it was up to me to do something im
not so good as a pilot having had only a hasty course at
kelly field before the war ended we had dual control
on the plane so that i could spell webster on long trips
in good weather but the weather wasnt so good now

  a higher power took the stick and some lesser divinities
managed the rudder bar because the plane got right side up
again i may have done it but i dont remember how

  i turned to see what manner of death had taken webster
from our midst he was apparently conscious he sat in
the cockpit like a sack of meal but his eyes were open
even if they didnt look intelligent i throttled the motor

  whats the idea i howled trying to give the boys
a thrill this crate wasnt made for stunting

  he sort of aroused himself

  were we upside down he shouted back i didnt
notice

  i flew the ship back and wondered whether theyd take
my pilot to the stockton or the norwalk home for persons
who have lost their marbles

  on the ground i asked him what was the big idea all
the time watching for him to get violent and bite me in
the leg he had forgotten all about the little episode in
the air

  know what shes gone and done he asked with a silly
expression

  know what whos done i demanded

  shes gone and started chasing around with that hymie
garfinkle he answered

  well whoever she is shes screwy too i said any-
one wliod look twice at hymie isnt worth doing tail spins
for snap out of it whats eating you

  helene he said real mournful helenes gone and
ditched me for that hymie on account of hymie being
artistic and having an expressive soul and im just a
cloud-hopper and i dont know anything about a lot of
things i never even heard of

  where does helene sell fish and why dont you hit her
on the head with a hard object that sometimes cures
insanity i said

  she doesnt sell fish webster asserted she writes
plays and poems and tilings shes going to write a play for
hymie she thinks that nut idea of his about being an
animal is good you couldnt hit her on the head with a
hard object youd want to kiss her shes as pretty as-
as-aw hell fella shes as pretty as that new monoplane
job they got over at long beach

  just how did you come to have a head-on collision with
helene i asked

  i took her for an airplane ride a couple of times she
wanted to catch the voice of the upper regions i couldnt
hear a thing then i hung around her place and we
went places sometimes she liked me once she kissed
me and said maybe shed marry me then shed get sore
about me not having any definite ideas of the relation of
pink lilies to a sunset over a purple mountain at half-past
six on a friday in february

 tljstice isnt blind i groaned they got her mixed up
with cupid lord he doesnt care who the hell he shoots
nor what different brands of half-wits he drags together

  this remark was lost on webster the lad was punch-
goofy cupid had him on the ropes and the first round
was in its infancy

  following days and events showed me that my news
reel business was in for hard times i couldnt depend
upon webster at all some days hed be cheerful because
helene had smiled at him and then he would fly through
hell then things would go wrong and i couldnt even
find him we missed a good train wreck that way i
couldnt get another pilot in the first place it wouldnt be
fair to webster and in the second place no good pilot would
take the job the pay wasnt sure enough

  i felt sorry for webster too he was a darned good
kid and it didnt seem right that some crack-brained fluff
should give him the run-around because he neither knew
nor cared anything about hymies brand of bilge love
had become a boil on websters nose and every other day
the mystery of the hidden pilot



helene would paste him on it or relieve it with a smiling
poultice

  tilings went along like that for a while then i got
wind of something that was brewing on my old lot that
would make a darned good news-reel shot the idiotic
hymie had promoted a publicity stunt that might click in
spite of the fact that he had thought of it

the plan had to do with the credulity of the newspapers
and that far was safe they were going to announce
that a trained ape old joe of whom i have spoken had
gone haywire and that they were going to deport him to a
private zoo on alazar island about twenty miles off the
coast the trip was to be made in an airplane and they
were going to take helene mayfare the little lady who
had placed my pilot in a state of comma along with them
the first story released to the newspapers would say that
they had to take helene because the ape loved her and would
not behave for any one else they did not state why it
was necessary to take an airplane but neither the public
nor the newspapers thought to ask about that publicity

siderable and i knew that the proposed trip to the island
would hurt him plenty

  however when the day for the flight came i managed
to drag him out to the strip of beach where the take-off
was to be made i figured id have to take a chance of
webster being able to do the job because other pilots
wanted too much money cash down and im a business
man when i have to be

  helene was there my first glimpse of her explained
why webster acted that way you may take my word for
it she was one neat little package two seconds after she
had smiled at me and confessed that she was glad to have
me meet her i would have mortgaged my brilliant future
for the privilege of paying her bills the rest of my life

  i judged that the kid was real people down deep in her
heart and that her artistic ideas were akin to a dose of
smallpox either she would get over it and be normal
or shed get worse and be a nut the rest of her days

  her eyes rested on webster and she favored the lad with
a smile that made the one i got seem like a frown i was
surprised to see that she actually liked my pilot her blue

  old joe gotj into actions just then he moved closer to tke
pilots braced kis feets in a kalf sitting positions and swayed oveip
the cockpits foip anj instants suddenly he leaned forward and
grasped tkepilots around the skoulders iiu kis kairy arms there
was a brief struggle an dtk enj sometking skot downward from the
plane

   old joe swayed oveip tke opens cockpits foip a momenta and tkens
crawled witkins

   i looked at tke twisting body of tke falling pilots and half skutj
my eyes ins horrortke oceanj was below buts tke fall wou id kill
him anyway just as it all seemed ovetn-

stunts are always that way most unexpected happen-
ings occur

  after the preliminary publicity the trip was to be made
but the ape wouldnt go instead hymie garfinkle was
going to don the habiliments of his not far removed
ancestors and take the place of old joe then later there
would be released a story that hymie had taken the place
of the ape to prove his ability as an actor-that he had
imitated an ape so cleverly that he had fooled the boys
helene would get her slice of publicity also it would be
announced that she was going to write a play in which
hymie was going to be starred

  i decided that despite my dislike for hymie business
was business i figured i could either sell some footage on
the thing to news-reel companies or that i could blackjack
jessup out of a few nickels with it i needed the money
so i planned to cover the thing

  when webster heard about the scheme a look came into
his eyes which promised poison hanging guns and other
forms of suicide he figured that if she took that trip
with hymie it would be all off for him i did my best to
chcer him up but it didnt do much good the lad was
seriously silly about the helene person

  a few days of grief passed we didnt have anything
to do in the way of filming catastrophies and webster
wouldnt have been of much use anyway he worried con-

eyes danced with a warm glow but her cherry lips were
wrinkled in a pout she surely did think a lot of him

 webster promptly blushed like an italian sunset and
 swallowed his tongue

 im so glad to see you she trilled dont you think
 this is a wonderful day isnt the water gorgeous isnt
 the sky nice isnt the beach wonderful isnt this air-
 plane trip going to be perfectly ducky

 she went on approving of this and that for some time
 youd a thought webster didnt agree with her he didnt
 utter a word i could see why the little lady got angered
 at my cloud-hopper lord a man ought to say something
 to a woman even if he is in love with her

t shall call my play souls of the ether she
-j- continued what do you think of it

 her eyes twinkled invitingly and the lips still pouted as
 webster remained dumb

 i nudged him viciously with my elbow

 say exquisite  i whispered

 exquisite webster gasped and then looked frightened
 o-oooo she squealed thats s-o-o-o nice of you
 tve never heard maple sugar trickling over a bed of
 rock candy but thats what her voice sounded like to me
 webster was a lucky dog

 if i could only think of more words to say like that


flying stories

maybe id have a chance webster told me later she
seemed to like that one

  ill write you a list i promised

  soon the truck drove up with old joe i placed my
camera nearby and was ready for some good preliminary
shots then the boy who seemed to be in charge of the
affair booted me farther back and made every one else fol-
low he said that old joe was in a bad mood and was
liable to eat innocent bystanders i whispered to the boy
that he was carrying the deception too far but he ignored
me maybe he hadnt been let in on the idea that hymie
was in the cage and not old joe

  finally a chute like they use for animals in a circus
was placed against the specially built cage that was lashed
behind the second cockpit near the tail helene posed for
a moment smiled and then climbed into die front cockpit
a second later the pilot entered the second cockpit and the
gate of die chute was opened there was a sullen roar
that was pretty good for hymie and a dark object lumbered
into the cage on the plane the prop was spun and the
plane took off circling for altitude above the beach

i climbed into my plane which was ready and web-
ster had soon gained altitude and was following close
behind the movie ship i trained my camera on the plane and
wondered for an instant if perhaps i could have been
mistaken in hymie he had certainly looked the part the
brief instant i had seen him old joe himself couldnt
have done much better i dismissed this generous thought
and laid the success of the ruse to the fact that a super-make-
up man had done the job

  helene looked up at us and waved a dainty hand web-
ster almost threw the ship into a tail spin lie was so tickled

  suddenly the idea hit me that as a business proposition
this flight of mine wasnt going to turn out so good they
hadnt let me get any decent ground shots and i wasnt
getting anything exciting up in the air i had just about
decided to turn back when strange things began to happen
and i changed my mind the plane ahead of us bobbed
and wavered for a moment it looked like something had
gone wrong with the controls

  then i figured that hymie had changed position in his
cage and had thrown the plane off balance it was a silly
stunt anyway the plane hadnt been made to carry such
a load and i began to worry

  then die front of the cage crashed open and a hairy
arm was extended soon a huge form crept out onto the
fuselage balancing precariously

  what has gone wrong with the idiot i asked myself
has he suddenly gone insane and got the notion that he
is a wing-walker 

  the answer to my question froze die blood in my veins
and almost knocked me out of the cockpit webster ducked
closer to the movie plane and the thing on the fuselage
turned its face toward me i knew that it wasnt hymie
garfinkle neither was it any man dressed like an ape

  the creature crouching against the force of the wind
and baring ugly teeth in a snarl was old joe himself

  i could see by old joes snarl and the way he shook
his head that he was sore as a boil at what had been done
to him i knew that old joe was hell incarnate when he
felt diat way and now he was afraid and that made it
worse no telling what he would do now i hoped every
minute that hed fall off and thus prevent what was certain
to happen in a minute if he kept his footing

  old joe stood still a second shaking his head from side
to side in anger and then he started to inch his way to the
cockpit in which sat the pilot unconscious of his danger
the ship ducked again and i could see the pilot working
at the controls he knew something was wrong but not
just what the girl hadnt looked back either

  just then webster saw what was going on and he went
crazy he dived low over the movie plane as if to brush

old joe off that made the ape angrier than ever and the
ensuing roar caused the pilot to look backward

  i was close enough to catch the expression on the mans
face ive never seen such fear written on human flesh
he stared fascinated at old joes snarling face and dien
sagged forward in the cockpit as his plane banked steeply

  i saw that it wouldnt be but a second before the plane
would crash i cursed hymie garfinkle and the crazy
scheme which was about to cause the death of a pretty
woman and a more or less efficient pilot even the ape
was worth more than hymie i told myself as i watched
the thing beneath me and tried to figure out how the ape
had got into the cage

  then i breathed easier for a moment the pilot snapped
out of it and pulled the stick back in time to avoid a spin
he ducked forward in the cockpit as if to avoid the thing
in back of him

  for gods sake spin loop anything to shake him
off i howled but of course no one heard me

  old joe got into action just then he moved closer to
the pilot braced his feet in a half sitdng position and
swayed over the cockpit for an instant suddenly he
leaned forward and grasped the pilot around the shoulders
in his hairy arms there was a brief struggle and then
something shot downward from the plane

  old joe swayed over the open cockpit for a moment and
then crawled within

  i looked at the twisting body of die falling pilot and half
shut my eyes in horror the ocean was below but the
fall would kill him anyway just as it all seemed over
something white shot upward and blossomed into a para-
chute the pilot was safe anyway i thanked providence
that there were still a few sensible fliers left webster also
always wore a parachute they come in handy in cases
like diat

  i turned my attention to the other plane old joe had
climbed into the cockpit and had hold of the stick

  then i understood what was making the apes brain
click we had made a comedy with him and had used him
in the cockpit of a dummy plane he had been taught
to jiggle the stick and kick the rudder bars the thing
had come back to him and he was doing what he had been
taught

  the plane was turning in crazy circles now it couldnt
be long before the crash old joe was bouncing up and
down in high glee he was no longer afraid and his anger
was gone he had always liked the movie plane and he
was happy now his hairy arms jerked the stick from
the left to the right and then he shoved it forward the
tail whipped from side to side and then the nose snapped
downward turning swiftly the propeller was sucking it
oceanward with terrifying speed

t saw helenes yellow hair streaming backward she had
turned and seen what had taken place-that the pilot
was gone that hymie wasnt in the plane and that a real
ape was her sole companion she had fainted with a shriek
i could almost hear and i was relieved a little to know
that her troubles were over she wouldnt feel die terri-
fying fear of the sudden plunge downward

  i shut my eyes as the plane neared the water and then
opened them in amazement as the plane leveled off old
joe had done the right thing by some miracle he had
shoved forward on the stick and then eased it gendy back
of course he didnt know what he was doing but anyway he
had done it

  the ship pancaked upon the surface of the water and
plowed forward through the swells it stopped undamaged
apparently the girl was safe unless old joe became an-
gered again i was debating whether or not it would do
any good if we made a landing on the surface and sacri-
ficed my ship to the ocean when my plane dipped forward
and something began falling away from it in a second
the mystery of the hidden pilot



something white billowed upward and webster was dan-
gling on the end of the thing

  the lad had hopped overboard with a parachute and left
me alone with the plane i figured he could at least have
warned me of his plan and tried to get my ship under
control again it was all i could do to get the thing on
the horizon again but i finally did it i had to by the
time i had the crate in hand webster had landed in the
water near the stranded plane he cut the chute belt
and swam to the movie ship

  i looked for trouble from old joe but the ape seemed
to be perfectly satisfied to fuss with the controls and hop
up and down in the cockpit i knew thered be no trouble
from him from then on

t banked and started back toward shore to my sur-
prise i learned that everything had taken place in
darned short time we had not flown far from the beach
those on shore had seen what happened and had sent out a
power-boat already the pilot of the movie plane and the
other two would be picked up soon

  in landing my plane i plowed up half an acre of the
beach and came to a stop when i washed out my under-
carriage it was far from a three-point

  as i walked toward the group on the beach the first
face i saw was jessups he was white as milk and his
face streamed sweat

  what the hells the idea i asked sending a woman
up with that ape im gonna sock you plenty next time
figure some other way of making money than by risking
other persons lives

  he grew whiter and started to talk i was going to paste
him anyway just for the ducks of the thing when i under-
stood what he was saying

  he claimed that he hadnt known anything about the
deal he said that hymie had doublecrossed him and that
the thing was done without hrs consent i believed him
jessup isnt that kind of a man but i would believe any-
thing of hymie hes the kind of a lad whod throw rocks
into an orphan asylum

  just then hymies ugly mug showed at the edge of the
crowd and i saw red i got him by the collar and dragged
him out in the clear

  well i asked

  i tried to make up like an ape but i couldnt he whim-
pered i figured it would be just as good publicity to let
them take old joe then i was going over to the island
by boat and have old joe taken back secretly after that
i was going to claim that it was me all the time i didnt
think-

  i figured that right there was the proper place to end

that sentence i punctuated it with a straight right that
was my masterpiece hymie sprawled like a sack of old
bottles

  just then jessup caught my arm and i whirled on him

  next time- he began

  shut up or youll get the same i said keep your
mouth shut and listen ive got you over a barrel and
im sure going to use the paddle in spite of the fact that
i was scared stiff up there i shot every foot of what
happened do you realize what that means lord
youve got the makings of the worlds best thriller there
it cant be duplicated i own that film you can have it
but youll pay old-timer youll put me back as director
and well cook up a plot to go with the action ive got
youll increase my salary and youll pay for the damage
i did to my plane besides that it will be understood that
every time this half-wit inflicts his presence on the lot im
going to knock him bow-legged otherwise you dont get
the film and the chance to make a million-dollar picture

  when i got out of breath i quit talking

  ill take the proposition he said what i was going
to say when you interrupted me was next time you hit
that hymie use both hands im sick of his looks

  he shook my hand

  now he said id better get him out of here before
that other pilot comes back there will be murder

  he dragged hymie to a car ard started off just as the
boat came back with the three wet victims of the lads
scheme they were in good shape except for being soaked
to the ribs

  in the distance i could see old joe still hopping about
on the sinking plane as a boat neared him

  helene was even more beautiful with her clothes plas-
tered to her dainty figure she had got over her fright by
now and was smiling again she snuggled close to web-
ster and looked up into his eyes

you have asked me to marry you she said my

  - answer is yes we do not follow the same trend of
thought but you are brave and noble and handsome and-
and-nice websters blushes were sending the water off
him in clouds of steam my idea is that conflict in ego is
conducive to happy mating what do you think of it

  she snuggled closer to him and smiled then a hurt
look came into her eyes

  webster was struggling desperately for just one word
if he could have thought of even one of the many cuss
words he knew he would have used that

  the situation was tense

  i delivered a lusty kick to the lads shin

  exquisite he gasped
wlgs of peril

a tall lean man stood on the rutted tarmac of
the ninth aero squadron of the fourth pur-
suit group of the american air forces in war-
weary france his slitted eyes were glued to
the blazing skies above him his face was pre-
maturely lined with deep gashes cut there by the grim hand
of searing soul-sickening war his black hair was streaked
with grey over his temples major cox was a young man
grown old early he had gazed into many bleeding skies
such as he was peering thoughtfully into now and had
seen many battle-marked ships come limping in from dan-
gerous patrols over enemy territory such as the swooping
wavering crippled crate which lashed down wildly now
for a landing

  but also the weary cold-eyed s c of the fighting fear-
less ninth pursuit squadron had waited times without num-
ber for certain of his pilots to wing down out of the blue-
times when the red-white-and-blue circle-marked wings that
had borne some laughing mocking youngster aloft did not
return major cox would finally go slowly back to the
operations tent and place a gold star after the name of an-
other pilot who had lofted buoyantly upon his last flight-
a patrol into the west from which none ever returned
then late into the night the major would sit hunched over
his littered desk in operations tent and write a letter to
another gold-star mother back in the states tears from
the majors tired eyes always were sealed in the envelopes
along with his penned condolences he knew that he

would never grow hardened to losing his nervy fearless
war-birds he knew that every time one of them fell before
the belching spandaus of an enemy pilot he would feel the
agony of the loss as poignantly as though it were his first
experience of the kind

  the majors joy was correspondingly great when he saw
familiar silver wings pointing out of the ether over no-
mans land and come slithering down to the ninths tarmac
then his heart would leap and his thin lips would twist in
a silent prayer of thanks to the gods of the dangerous air-
ways he would return to operations tent and smile con-
tentedly as he plunged into the mass of work that was al-
ways piled up for him there

hphe pilots of the ninth squadron often laughed among
themselves about the squadron commanders solicitude
about them but deep in their hearts they appreciated it
one day patrol leader cliff andreas put into words all
of their thoughts about major cox he was sitting in his
roost talking and drinking with the steel-muscled hard-
eyed members of his flight the s c had stuck his head
inside the flap of the tent and seeing that they were all en-
joying themselves and relaxing properly from their last
patrol over the lines-a hot one-major cox had waved
them a greeting and then withdrawn his head quickly and
gone on about his many duties cliff andreas roared in his
rumbling throaty voice

  gosh-all-fish-hooks he said cox sure gives me the

                               carl

a thrilling sky fights of a commanderxiho met the enemy
single-handed to savep his boys

weary-willies at tirues im gettin so that i see those
burning eyes of his in my sleep yeah he went on
in a strained tone of voice i even see them when im
aloft when things get the hottest up there i seem to
see those eyes of hisn and they always put new heart
into me for some reason but gawd how its gettin
on my nerves

  the leader of d flight picked up a large brown
bottle and filled his glass anew with stinging cognac
he drained it at a gulp the silence that ensued was
finally broken by red falkner falkner had been with
the ninth only a little over a week he came up from
the pool at issoudun fresh from his training at kelly
field the war was new to him and so he saw every-
thing about him with a fresher vision than did the
veterans of the outfit

 c ay he spoke softly the skipper reminds me of
 something diat i have often seen back home you
guys know im a westerner well ive ridden through
the hills of my dads ranch many a day and come across
an old eagle teaching its young brood to rustle for itself
i used to get quite a kick out of watching them the
old eagle would push the young ones out of its nest and
you know they nest way up on some craggy height
then it would circle about in the blue and watch the
youngsters flop spin and tumble the old one
wouldnt help the young ones a bit but would just fly
around and watch them kind of proudlike it seemed
to know that they would make out all right well red
glanced about the circle of interested faces and then
went on quietly major cox reminds me of that eagle
he watches us guys as we test our wings and i think
he too like that old bird is proud of the record of the
ninth-mighty proud

  well chimed in prof martin at this point you

 have hit it pretty well red cox is proud
 of the record die ninth is hanging up for
 itself but i dont think that is the entire
 reason he takes such an interest in us fel-
 lows martin had been an under-profes-
 sor of psychology in a western college be-
 for the war he prided himself upon the
 fact that he could read the motives of men
 he looked quickly about the group of
 pilots and then went on with his diag-
 nosis of the motives of their leader since
 cox had his foot put out of commission
 and he had to take a kiwis berdi he has
 been eating his heart out here on the
 ground he wants to fly but is ordered
 not to consequently he is flying in
 spirit with every one of us he crashes
 when we crash or comes through when
 we come through

            a long silence ensued when
          prof martin had finished talk-
          ing the brown bottle had gone
          the rounds time after time eyes
          were bleary speech was be-
          coming thick and guttural then
          cliff andreas spoke again
          well he muttered thickly
          im for him lie was an ace
          before us guys knew
          there was such a thing
          as a war going on he
          came over and signed
          up with the french right
          soon after the boche
          started their first move
          on paris he has more




flying stories

victories to his credit than all of us combined i say its
a damn shame that he had to be grounded oncc a fellow
gets the tang of the air in his blood its just plain hell to
stay on the ground and see other guys go up

  the leader of d flight arose to his feet upon airing
his views of major cox he motioned with a sweep of his
arm for the rest to fill up their glasses again when he had
done so he raised his glass aloft and spoke again his voice
was soft with feeling a he continued

  lets drink he said to the best old s c in france
may he fork a joy-stick again 

  may cox fly again  the others echoed in chorus
then they lifted the full tumblers to their thin lips and a
deep sigh swept through the group as they dropped their
glasses back onto the table

rphe leader of d flight was thinking about that scene
as he fought with the refractory controls of his spad and
tried desperately to land his crippled crate on the ninth tar-
mac he could barely see the ground through his blearing
eyes his breath was coming in sickening wheezes through
his tight-stretched lips his hands were shaking on the joy-
stick his face was a death-mask of oil and blood he was
almost out yet he knew he had to land the spad he knew
that major cox would be waiting down there on the tar-
mac-waiting for the only surviving member of d flight

  andreas felt the wheels of his thundering crate kiss the
turf at last he straightened it out and taxied toward the
hangars a group of medianics rushed forward at the com-
mand of major cox and hauled the sleek but machine-
gunned plane to a halt the s c made his way to the
cockpit of the spad and gently lifted the broken form of
cliff andreas to the ground

  as major cox stretched the wounded patrol leader on
the turf of the tarmac the latter looked up into his s cs
drawn face and muttered through cut bleeding lips

  they got em all but me he whispered i came back
to report to you-i just was able-to make it cliffs head
fell back upon coxs arm pie conked out

  the commander of the ninth gave the wounded pilot over
to the care of the doctor who had rushed up with the ambu-
lance which was always ready on the field these bone-
scramblers always seemed to sense when something was
wrong long before the ships landed it had been so in this
case they had been prepared for the worst when they saw
andreas crate come wobbling down out of the blue they
lifted the broken form of the sky-rider and placed him ten-
derly upon a stretcher and then shoved it gently into the
back of the ambulance

  major cox turned away with bowed head and limped
slowly toward the operations tent

  dusk fell over the ninths tarmac and numerous candles
were lighted in the hangars and roosts still major cox
was hunched over his littered table in the operations tent
a candle had been lighted by his dog-robber as darkness
fell its wavering light played upon the white lined face
of the s c a tear-stained sheaf of papers was before him
far into the night he labored over those missives that would
bear terrible news to waiting parents far across the seas

  major cox composed the following missive and then
copied it six times changing only the heading of each one
and the name of the crashed pilot

ninth aero squadron fourth pursuit group

                                             a e f

                                        july  

  mr and mrs iv p martin
  grand junction tenn

  dear friends

    it is my grievous duly to inform you of the death of
  your son harold f martin he was brought down to-
  day by the enemy he fought bravely and well but his
  time had come he gave his life for our great cause and

  i know went down as a brave man loses-with a smile
  upon his lips

    harold rue called him prof here was respected
  and loved by every man in this outfit we will feel his
  loss as poignantly as you will and we will never forget
  him every man in the ninth squadron sends you
  his deepest most heartfelt sympathy prof often spoke
  of yon so we feel that we know you ive know what
  you have lost in your son for we have had the honor of
  knowing him

    however we understand that mere words are futile
  at a time like this kindly accept our kindest respects
  and sympathy

                               very sincerely

                    major john f cox
            commanding ninth pursuit squadron

  the squadron commander finally finished the letters of
condolence he folded them with shaking fingers and in-
serted them in their envelopes he placed them on the
top of a pile of mail that would go out by special carrier in
the morning then he got wearily up from his chair
stretched his tall figure and hobbled over to a list of names
on a board hung to the canvas of one wall of the tent he
placed six new gold stars beside six names he bowed his
head as he stood before the list of men who were and who
had been pilots of the ninth it seemed to him that the
list was becoming fearsomely studded with gold stars  after
a long moment he turned away and went out of the tent

  he breathed a weary sigh as he felt the soft turf of the
field beneath his feet his eyes were blood-shot his face
was twitching with the effort he had expended in writing
those letters his feet faltered heavily as he tottered to-
ward the line

  ships were warming up there great ghostly winged
creatures that hovered strangely like huge birds of prey
ships that would streak down the runway soon upon the
usual nightly patrols ships that would carry other young-
sters into those glowering skies over the front lines and
perhaps would not bring them back again ships of doom i
ships that reminded the commander of the ninth squadron
of eerie barks that sailed filthy seas of treachery and death
ships that carried his young pilots like crusaders of old into
unknown climes ethereal uncharted places of horror where
fate played with them and sometimes betrayed diem

  major cox threw back his shoulders to free himself of
these ominous thoughts and limped quickly up to the line of
warming planes another officer was standing by the first
ship on the line he glanced up inquiringly as he saw the
major approaching

captain stan lewdrop leader of a flight was wait-
ing to go up on a solo mission at midnight he was a
broad-shouldered thick-barreled man of medium height his
face was heavy-jowled and glowering his eyes pools of ice
full red lips were set in an unsmiling straight line through
his dark face his arms were heavy and well muscled and
his hairy hands short-fingered and powerful stan lewdrop
had flown with the ninth squadron since america had en-
tered the war before that he had been with a squadron of
canadians more victories were listed to his credit than to
any in the ninth except major cox he was a nerveless
fighting machine of the greatest efficiency and many of the
other pilots of the ninth often whispered in his absence one
without heart or soul

  his eyes snapped and questioned as he focused them upon
the squadron commander then he spoke in a rumbling
voice that seemed to come from a deep region way down in
his thick chest

  tough about d flight eh major he growled i hear
they were wiped out except for andreas it sure is a hell
of a shame they were all good kids

  yeah answered the major in a soft voice they were a
good gang it seems that they flew into that jagdstaffel of
wings of peril



von platen were outnumbered and cut down andreas man-
aged to limp in but the others were brought down in flames
god  i wish i could get that von platen bird he always
goes up with such a big circus that our boys havent a chance
when they meet up with him but-our youngsters always
give him a real scrap i understand that d flight fought
brilliantly today but were beaten by numbers

  well grumbled stan lewdrop i know one thing this
von platen guy is getting the goat of our pilots it seems to
me that the jerry high command is sending up big cir-
cuses for a purpose that purpose to my way of thinkin
is to sap the morale of our men they are doing it our
guys are gettin mighty shaky have you noticed that
major cox dropped his head upon his chest and studied
the ground for a long moment before he answered when
he again raised his head his eyes were shining like polished
rapiers in the gloom

  i have noticed it he admitted i have known for some
time that something had to be done to buck up our men
in fact if something isnt done soon well be out on our
feet god i sure hate to see the look in our boys eyes
when they come in from meeting von platen then too
these messages that german drops after every big victory
isnt helping things any it has to be stopped

  yeah snorted lewdrop throatily but how

tiell answered cox ill tell you how see that
crate of andreas next to yours he pointed a
tense arm toward the second panting ship on the line

  uh huh grunted lewdrop as he cast a quick look be-
hind him

  that crate is the answer as to how i am planning to stop
von platen growled major cox i look for that guy to
come over with his circus some time tonight when he
comes hes going to get the surprise of his life up until
now weve been trying to top him with archies that
doesnt work he conics swooping down from a high ceil-
ing and goes back the same way in that manner he escapes
the ring of shrapnel we throw about the tarmac he drops
his message and then beats it he has been thumbing his
nose at us in this way for a long time tonight hes due
for a little surprise party

  whadye mean inquired the interested leader of a
flight he searched the white face of the squadron com-
mander intently it told him little in the gloom that shrouded
the tarmac like a pall

  this snapped the s c im going up in that spad of
andreas im going to lay way up in the ceiling until von
platen flies his circus over this tarmac he usually comes
over just before dawn when he comes im going to slash
down into him in the darkness i should be able to do a
lot of damage to the jerry circus before they get me then
too i have a bunch of hand grenades in that spads cock-
pit with them and the vickers gun it is equipped with i
should be able to bring down a goodly number of the boche
what growled the leader of a flight i thought you
were ordered not to fly what about that bad foot of yours 
do you think you can handle a plane that way better
wait until i come back from this damn mission i am to make
and ill give you a hand

  orders must be broken at times said cox this is
one of the times that im going to break one i am not go-
ing to stay grounded and see my boys hacked to pieces i
know i can still handle a crate by strapping my good foot
to the rudder bar if i am shot down i wont be missed much
any way there are a lot of squadron commanders but
mighty few good pilots im going up just before dawn
another long silence ensued between the two taut men
then captain lewdrop stuck out his hand and roared
well if you must go up good luck to you old-timer
thanks answered cox quietly he shook lewdrops
hand warmly

  then the leader of a flight jumped toward his spad
he revved up the hisso for a moment while his hawk eyes

watched the instrument board he grunted in satisfaction
as he saw that everything was in good order then he mo-
tioned toward his waiting mechanic to pull the chocks they
were whisked from beneath the jumping wheels of the pant-
ing spad lewdrop fed the crate the gun and thundered
down the dark runway he zoomed wildly into the funereal
void of the night
major cox watched him out of sight then he hobbled
slowly over to the ship he was to fly in a few short hours
his face was grim as he inspected the spad peering into its
narrow cockpit to see if it was equipped with its load of
death-dealing grenades two grease and oil-smeared me-
chanics were reconditioning the crate major cox spoke
to them for a moment and then went back toward the shad-
owy row of bunk-tents he needed a few hours sleep be-
fore he took off on his dangerous mission-before he met
the devilish von platen

  it was in those eerie hours preceding dawn that the
ninths s c again made his way across the tarmac toward
the line he saw immediately that his spad was warming
up preparatory to his lofting into the dark skies coxs
eyes were heavy and red-rimmed his mouth was tight and
strained he felt a tingle in his blood as he contemplated
again a joy-stick and feeling another slipstream whip
about his ears

  the major gnawed a beef sandwich and sipped a tin of
scalding coffee he was dressed in the flying clothes that
he had discarded a few short months ago at the order of his
superior officers his goggles felt good as they rested on
his leather-helmeted forehead his shoulders were braced
contentedly back in his leather fleece-lined coat

  as major cox limped up to the line he met the startled
look in the eyes of the mechanics there with a smile he
nodded toward the spad on the line and spoke to a sergeant
who was in command of the troop of mechanics on duty
everything in shape sergeant he asked softly think
that old crate will be safe for a cripple like me

  yes sir the sergeant answered as he raised a grimy
paw in salute the major would be safe in anything we
all know that there is none better at handlin a joy-stick
than the major sir

  cox laughed metallically then he dropped his coffee
tin and crammed the remainder of his sandwiches into his
mouth he stepped up to the side of the gray fuselage of
the spad lie stroked it with his gauntleted hand as he lis-
tened keenly to the rhythmic drone of its motor a quiet
smile hovered about his thin lips as he watched the final in-
spection by the mechanics

  expert fingers snapped the wires between the spads wings
playing a weird tune upon them knowing hands tested
struts and wings and keen eyes swept undercarriage and tail
assembly all was in order the spad was in readiness to
go aloft to meet von platen and his circus of enemy war-
birds

     ajor cox squeezed his lanky figure into the nar-
row cockpit of the spad and strapped his foot to the
bar he grinned happily over the side of the battle-marked
fuselage at the waiting mechanics

  pull the chocks he roared over the staccato thunder
of the motor

  right answered the sergeant

  the blocks were whisked from under the straining wheels
of the plane cox then fed it the gun the spad moved
slowly away from the line as the s c poured the gun to
the willing crate it picked up speed and thundered down the
runway then with his blood leaping in his veins the
commander of the ninth squadron hauled back lustily upon
the stick and thundered into the funereal void of the heavens

  as cox felt the spad lift him to the heights he laughed
unrestrainedly into the pitchy blackness about him his
fiery eyes glanced keenly about him in the pitchy blackness
and he gazed unafraid into the ominous pall of night which
blanketed the ninths tarmac and blotted the lofting plane


flying stories

from the view of the men on the shrouded ground he
wrestled with the controls of the plunging plane and climbed
for die pitchy ceiling every nerve in his tense body seemed
to cry with the exultation of being in flight once more his
face twitched with the feeling seething in his soul and the
thoughts that raced dirough his brain made his eyes feel red-
rimmed and cold he heaved a deep sigh of contentment
he was satisfied now for he was streaking toward the
bloody stamping-ground of the heights he was to meet
von platen in one last grim battle if he lost he would
have fought again at least if he won well he would have
saved the morale of those sleeping boys in their quiet
roosts on the ground

  cox climbed the spad until he had reached an altitude of
about  feet then he swept the crate into wide circles
about the heavens he lurked beneadi the stars a demon of
doom to any watching eyes beneadi him he was cutting
wide swaths in the diamond fields of the higher regions he
glanced about him into the ghostly ether strange phantoms
materialized weirdly to his right and to his left only to dis-
sipate into the darkness as he swept upon them with his
thundering roaring wire-shrieking spad the liurding
slipstream screamed and groaned about him the cherry-
red exhaust below him made a staccato cacophony of fury
as he split through the blackness he swept the inky hori-
zon for a view of the expected jerry jagdstaffel of von
platen

then hesaw them myriads of little fireflies coming out
- of the north the jerries were flying at about 
feet the lights of die enemy exhausts grew larger and
closer with the speed of light cox hunched over his con-
trols and gunned his streaking crate the phantom enemy
flight was now circling high over the ninths tarmac

  the squadron commander pushed forward on his joy-stick
he nosed his spad down for the back of the boche jagdstaf-
fel coxs eyes were mere slits in his face his mouth a
straight red line his right hand was a ball of bone and
muscle on the stick the yankee crate came out of the
ceiling propelled by a thundering roaring motor wires
shrieked struts moaned as the major struck the circling
jagdstaffel of the enemy

  the jerries were sweeping down over the yankee tarmac
under throtded power a faint drum of motors the swish
of batlike wings the whine of strained struts were the only
things that disturbed the quiet of the night the leader of
the enemy flight must soon have realized the strangeness of
this nights reception unlike other nights there were no
anti-aircraft guns barking into the heights or powerful
searchlights piercing the gloom of the heavens von platen
must have realized this and have swept the inky ground with
feverish questioning eyes he must have shuddered with
premonition as he thundered down closer over the ground
then no doubt his eyes were drawn abrupdy to the heights
for cox was coming down under full power on the back of
his jagdstaffel the american had thrown his crate into
die very midst of the enemy circus the night was lighted
widi crimson licking flames and shattered with the furious
snarl of machine-guns made hideous with the growl of
bursting grenades

  the high-flying death-defying commander of the ninth
squadron went utterly berserk as he dug his fangs into the
nearest jerry crate his mind was a blank except for one
thing he saw the face of chris andreas as he lay in his
arms and whispered up at him they got them all but me
i came back-to report-to you then with a shudder cox
remembered how the youngster had fallen back into his
arms unconscious the broken body of andreas seemed to
epitomize to cox all those other youngsters who had lofted
into dangerous skies to come back crushed and bloody or
not at all remembering all this the grim pilot hurded his
spad into the enemy with all the fury at his command he
did not look through his gun-sights it would be useless to
do so in the blackness of the night those dead sights would

be but empty round holes the s c pointed the nose of his
crate straight at the first shadowy sweeping form below
him and pressed down hard on his gun trips and kept them
there with the first furious blast from his heating vickers
the jerry went down in flames

  ah he breathed into the stench of his cockpit i wish
those officious brass hats could see me now god its good
to be up here-a real man again 

  men poured from the hangars and bunk-tents upon the
yankee tarmac and ran furiously toward the far end of die
field where the jerry was burning they lifted their eyes to-
ward the shooting spad it was milling frenziedly among
black wings of wavering hun planes they lifted their fists
into the heavens their throats stretched to emit scorching
blasphemy they moaned and cursed at the strange yet
subtly heartening fight against terrific odds in the skies

  one of the mechanics who had come from die hangar
began to jibber and cry insanely his nerve had broken
he moaned over and over again above the roar of motors
in the skies and die hiss of leaping flames on the ground
hes up there-the majors up there hes up there alone

  then other pilots and grease monkeys turned and looked
at him they shuddered they glanced quickly from one
to another all their faces turned white drained of all
color it was the first intimation they had had that major
cox had gone up alone to meet von platen

  then their heads were jerked back upon their shoulders
there now mingled with the whine of spandaus and the snarl
of vickers guns the harsher reports of bursting grenades

  as cox had zoomed toward his second ship he had reached
into his cockpit and drawn out a hand grenade he primed
it with his teeth as he came up underneath the black belly
of the second enemy crate he pressed down hard on his gun
trips for a series of short bursts then releasing diem he had
thrown a grenade with all his might into the whirling prop
of the black-winged plane as he swept by and up and beyond
it it shot down immediately then he twisted in a tight
bank-a dizzy head-twirling bank-dropped the nose of his
spad and shot toward another enemy spraying it with his
death-dealing guns again his right hand went into the
depths of his cockpit again it flashed forth with death in
its sweaty palm and his teeth primed another grenade his
arm shot over the side of his cutting fuselage and another
jerry crate was shattered by the concussion of die fatal
grenade as it struck and exploded

hfhe major was grinning fiercely into the ripped indigo
skies as he swept his eyes to the right and the left of
his tiirashing crate the slipstream whipped the blood to his
lined face every nerve in his body was tense to the break-
ing point his vision was filled with whirring black wings
his brain was a seething hades where death hatched in
ugly ghastliness he thrashed his crate about recklessly
dived into the bottom of his cockpit and snapped erect
again with another grenade his shoulders snapped back
determinedly as he whirled to meet another enemy crate

  the circus of von platen had been utterly disorganized
the enemy crates were swirling about the blasted ether
like demented beings in a black hell in crazy zooms banks
and crazier reverses they were desperately trying to reach
the heights again and to streak back to the north from which
they had come but due to the fact that they did not know
where the enemy lurked or when he would strike they could
not adequately maneuver their plunging ships and put their
plan into effect they did not dare blaze away with their
spandau guns as recklessly as as they would have liked for
fear of striking down a friend

  major cox was here there and everywhere until he
struck the enemy did not know whether he was a friend or
foe undisturbed he got in his death-dealing blows
-efliciendy and quickly ship after ship left the air over the
ninths tarmac to crash to the hard ground the jerry
pilots were becoming desperate crazy with fear they
whirled and swooped and twisted and turned crazily and
wings of peril



dizzily trying to escape the scoring death in their midst
still cox held on blazing away with his vickers gun and
hurling grenades

  then the men on the ground were struck speechless with
terror von platen leader of the night-raiding jerry flight
had singled out cox in his spad he swooped for the
americans tail both ships whirled toward the ground
now they were away from the rest of the milling crates
they were illuminated by the light cast by the crates burn-
ing on the ground startled men standing with uplifted
white faces on the tarmac of the ninth squadron saw that
cox and von platen were in a last terrific death-grapple
one or the other of them must kiss the dust-one or the
other of them must go down 

trow he snarled harshly into the blasting slipstream
i well see if a crippled kiwi can whip a lousy square-
head he laughed ill be grounded for a million lifetimes
for flying tonight but von platen is going to ground for
eternity 

  major coxs face was a white death-mask every nerve
in his lean body was torn by the battle he hauled back on
his stick hauled the spad up on its tail held it there quiver-
ing for a long moment then dropped onto his back then he
poured full gun to the old crate and went at the enemy ship
on his tail on his own back he pressed down on his gun
trips and held them down hot steel pierced the flame-lit
sky hot steel found the enemys cockpit von platen had
been taken by surprise he cut his throttle and dropped
his crate away from the onrushing yankee then cox
winged over straightened out and came back on von platens
tail

  both crates circled about in battle formation in a wide
sweeping turn creeping up expertly onto each others tail
the two warbirds swooped and twirled the other german
crates had turned tail and flown north afraid to attack for
fear of doing harm to their leader the air was free now
for the greatest batde ever witnessed by the weary tense
men on the ground who had seen many encounters in their
eventful days at the front

  major cox soon learned that he was at a disadvantage in
this fight with the efficient german because of his bad foot
but then as he crept closer and closer to the crate ahead of
him he reached forward and grasped his gun trips he
thumbed them burst after burst streaked through the
skies toward the jerry crate yet they fell short von
platen grinning back through the murk lit with crimson
flames grinned mockingly at the desperately fighting ameri-
can behind him yet there was more than mockery in the
boches eyes-respect and fear mingled in their depths

  then the jerry leafier hauled his crate back into a dizzy
crazy immelmann straight for the spinning prop on the
nose of the spad he flew spandaus were spitting in a
frenzy the enemys steel reached the american ship von
platen raked the spad from stem to stern as he whirled by
coxs stricken plane wavered and then slipped off crazily
and sickeningly upon its left wing von platen came thun-
dering back snapping and snarling on the tail of the yan-
kee ship 

  white-faced men on the ground dared not look into that
blazing fearsome ether for they knew that they would see
their beloved s c coming down to a crash landing a
shout made them look again and a cheer arose for another
plane had thundered down into the dog-fight between cox
and von platen with shouts of glee the men on the ground
shook their hands vehemently toward that new diving crate

  lewdrop who had been delayed longer than he had ex-
pected on his midnight patrol zoomed down out of the
heights just as von platen found coxs ship with one last
destroying blast from his hot spandaus lewdrop saw cox
waver and then slide off onto a broken left wing he saw
red  he knew that the s c was in a desperate condition
he gunned his motor and climbed down onto von platens
back he caught the german unawares and raked the black

enemy crate with one long blasting spew from his eager
vickers gun the jerry leader went down in flames then
captain lewdrop whirled about in a deep bank looking
for cox

  he saw the major land the shaky but exultant s c
got within fifty feet of the ground before he could straighten
out his crate it steadied for a moment at his touch on the
thrashing controls then dropped in a pancake landing lew-
drop swept down after him bounced to a landing cut his
motor and jumped out of the cockpit before his plane had
come to a stop

  he whirled and followed the group of pilots and mechanics
who were rushing toward the squadron commanders spad
as lewdrop rushed up it burst into flames the belching
flames swept back the pilots and mechanics into a huddled
horrified group lewdrop burst through them and rushed up
to the flame-belching ship the spad was on its back and
cox was hanging out of his cockpit suspended by his safety
belt lewdrop braved the flames they licked out greedily
and singed his hair and eyebrows the flesh of his face
withered before their scorching breath he struggled with
the safety belt that imprisoned cox and finally felt the lean
form of the squadron commander fall into his waiting arms
he dragged the s c back from that burning spad

  major cox was unconscious as a nervous doctor jumped
out of an ambulance that had thundered up to the scene and
leaned over him his eyes flew open and he recognized his
surroundings he grinned up weakly into the faces lean-
ing over him in a breathless circle he croaked in a voice
that seemed to come from the grave itself

  got him said the blistered lips of the ninths comman-
der von platen wont chalk up any more victories over our
boys got him-even if he did-get me

  cox fell back into stan lewdrops arms and went out
again the doctor leaned quickly over him and made a
quick efficient examination he got up and faced the anxious
group about him and said with a confident smile

  hell pull through boys he nodded sagely as he saw
the look of relief on their faces hes got a nasty scratch in
the shoulder but the shock of such a fight as he put up and
then crashing has hurt him more than his shoulder wound
hell be all right in a half hour or so

  that night the ninth squadron threw a binge they
lingered over their supper in the officers mess tent bottle
after bottle of champagne was broken out the war-worn
pilots began to laugh more naturally again that metallic
something that had been in their voices during the early
hours before dawn when they had witnessed that desperate
dog-fight between cox and von platens jagdstaffel was
gone now they smiled proudly as they looked down toward
the head of the table where the major was seated

  stan lewdrop arose to his feet he lifted a full glass of
champagne toward the ceiling he roared in a throaty
thick voice on your feet buzzards he cried lets drink
to the damnedest snappiest nerviest squadron commander in
the a e f a guy who will fly in spite of hell a guy
who will fly in spite of orders  a guy who will go up
single-handed to bring down von platens whole circus

every man was on his feet and all glasses were raised
toward the ceiling as stan lewdrop finished every
man roared his concurrence to the captains views

  yea yea they howled in chorus

  when quiet reigned again lewdrop went on drink to
the guy buzzards that will fly to meet death and hell itself
for his buddies major cox

  they drank then with one gesture the thin glasses which
had held the champagne were all crashed on the floor they
slumped down into their chairs again and more champagne
was brought in the binge was on they had earned it

  major cox smiled wanly but contentedly as he saw that
tense nervous gleam that lately had lurked in them fade
out of the eyes about the long table

  he was satisfied to stay grounded now

aviation dictionary

anj exhaustive authentic invaluable assembly and explanation of all tv  ds
terms and phrases used today ins thep world of flying

compiled by

capt edwin t hamilton

chairman macfadden aviation advisory board

vite are proud to
  present here to
our readers the first
complete aviation dic-
tionary to be com-
piled anywhere

  although aviation
is of recent origin and development hundreds of new
words terms and phrases have found their way into our
language some of them have already become bywords and
yet few know their real full meanings and significance nor
up to now has there been any easily available way of learn-
ing them feeble and ineffectual attempts have been made
to put a flying dictionary together but either the task has
been too great or the realization of the demand for one too
little the editors of flying stories understand this de-
mand scores of readers have written us pleading for an
aviation dictionary they state that they have sought every-
where but cannot find one anywhere-and they are right

parti

  consequently to
give our readers the
service which is their
due we arranged
with captain edwin
t hamilton chair-
man of the macfad-
den aviation advisory board to compile a dictionary which
should be complete exhaustive authentic and insofar as
possible comprehensible-the last word in the presentation
of aviation definitions the result of his intelligent ef-
fort is here clip out these pages and save them for
reference later on we will have to get out another dic-
tionary we suppose because new words and terms are con-
tinually being coined

  but this is up to the moment and we hope that the defini-
tions will be clear to you in case you want further en-
lightenment on any expression write to the macfadden
aviation advisory board for the details you wish

important announcement

 when we first decided to present to our readers an accurate and authentic aviation dictionary as an integral part of
 flying stories magazine it was our intention to present this aviation dictionary complete in this issue but as the
 work of assembling and compiling the important technical information went forward we found ourselves confronted
 with a real problem-

 we found that we would either have to give our readers less than their full quota of thrilling flying stories assigned to
 this issue or else present the aviation dictionary in two consecutive issues

we decided upon the latter course although the cover was already printed with the announcement that it would
appear complete in this issue		

 the june issue of flying stories will contain the remainder of this highly authentic and up-to-the-minute aviation
 dictionary without it leing necessary for us to withhold a single one of the breath-taking and thrilling stories of the air
 such as are always to be found in flying stories magazine

 a game iru tke sky jiheru nerve jvas trump

after his first flight jimmy mccray knew that
he was going to be a flyer dip reynolds the
pilot told him so there could be no reasonable
 doubt of the future when dip foretold it con-
sidering who he was to jimmy who was turn-
ing sixteen dip was a veteran of the world in point of
fact dip himself was only twenty-eight but he was an ace
of the a e f flying service with a citation two wound-
stripes and a marvelous sense of humor

  yes sir said dip with emphasis youve got air sense
jimmy now take it when we were making that steep
bank you didnt turn a hair most people get wild-eyed
when you stunt with em theyre scared at the take-off
an sick at the landing im telling you boy youve got the
stuff

  jimmy took the praise calmly

  shucks he said i liked it id rather fiyn eat

thats what makes a flyer dip told him youve
got to like it better than anything else in the world

 they were standing beside the sine-motored jenny that
 dip used for passenger flying jimmy close beside the
 cockpit could feel the heat waves from the engine that had
 just lifted him over the field

 i like it bettern anything else already he announced
 he gazed admiringly into the pilots keen wind-whipped
 eyes

 will you tike me up again sometime mister reynolds
 sure jimmy any time we get a chance

 the boy smiled happily and turned reluctantly from the
 plane

 well i better sell my papers the home editions ought
 to be cornin along any minute now

 all right son put one in my mail-box at the office
 will you see you later




flying stories

  you sure will said jimmy thanks an awful lot
 he wheeled and ran across the broad expanse of the
 landing-field toward the hangars too overcome with emotion
 to say more

  back at the office where the afternoon papers were de-
 livered jimmy became a hero the flyers and mechanics
 laughingly remarked on his flight working around the
 field jimmy had become familiar to them all there were
 transatlantic men among them and unknown students
 there were continental racers and war heroes whose names
 were frequently in black type in the papers he sold

  well now youre a flyer jimmy said dusty dcvoe
 a transcontinental ace i suppose you wont sell papers
 any more

  what do you read jimmy asked quickly grinning
 i got em all mister

  the laugh was on dusty

 rphe kid hasnt a swelled head remarked diver lewis
 --a mail pilot hes not like some of the boobs i know
 in the flyin game

   dusty pretended to take the remark as a personal affront
 you dont mean that for me do you diver he de-
 manded

  i mean it for any swell-headed flyer replied diver

 grinning if the shoe fits-

  dusty laughed

  all right just for that jimmy ill take you up my-
 self thats moren lewis will do

  when jimmy asked instantly going to the root of
 the matter without delay

  how about tomorrow

  gee thats great said jimmy

  diver grinned

  watch out for him jimmy hes not a safe flyer hes
 likely to lose flying speed right over the field

  true to his promise dusty greeted jimmy at the hangar
 on the following afternoon he was revving his mono-
 plane with a trained ear cocked to catch the least variation
 in the even song of the engine jimmy stood back watch-
 ing

   all right kid dusty shouted over the staccato drone of
 the idling motor from a locker near the wall he took a
 leather helmet and a jacket of the same material they were
 much too large for jimmy but he slid into them quickly

  climb up the pilot directed well wheel her out
 directly

  obediently jimmy went up to the little step and crawled
 into the cockpit before him was a curved wind-shield to
 protect his face from the rushing air

  he twisted around in the low weather seat to stare aft
 behind him was the pilots seat where dusty would direct
 their flight while he waited jimmy busied himself in
 a study of the dual controls that were revealed in his tiny
 compartment suddenly the pilot was beside him stand-
 ing on the little rung that was placed in the fuselage

  keep your hands off that stuff he shouted smiling
 are you all set

  gee sure

  jimmys heart fluttered as he saw dusty crawl into his
 place below a mechanic kicked out the chocks from the
 wheels at the pilots signal the engine raised its voice
 to a tcrrific roar jimmy stared back into the grinning
 face of the pilot as they moved out to the field dusty
 switched off and the silence was intense as the engine died
 keep your head in sou here we go

  they were off

  in one respect jimmy found this flight different from
 his first with dip reynolds on that occasion he had
 devoted himself entirely to watching the earth below

  now jimmys interest was centered in the dual controls
 once they were in the air he ceased to look down in-
 stead he watched the rudder-bar as dusty kickcd it over
 for a bank or he studied the stick as they climbed or

 pointed down he marveled at the deliberate slowness of
 their action and at the swift response that came instantly
 from ailerons and rudder

  every time he looked out jimmy experienced strange
little thrills that were unlike anything he had known in
his boyish way he tried to analyze them he was instantly
certain that it wasnt fear even when dusty sent her
down in a long dive he was not afraid to be sure he
turned and regarded dusty with gleaming excited eyes
but it was not fear that he felt it was elation

  carefully he stretched his legs and settled his feet lightly
on the rudder-bar in this way he could feel the
action when dusty turned on either wing after a few
moments of this he dropped his hand easily on the stick
careful to offer no resistance when it shoved ahead or
pulled back he soon discovered that the plane moved
with the stick likewise the rudder-bar but he was not
aware that dusty felt the weight of his hands and feet
 the controls neither did he know that the pilot was
smiling to himself in his cockpit

  they circled presendy and headed back for the distant
field long before they were over it jimmy made out the
hangars and began to take an interest in the landing dusty
with the true caution of an old pilot circled down easily
and came to a three-point landing as gently as a baby
carriage descends from step to paved walk they turned
and taxied in toward the line

  their arrival at the field office was much like the one
that followed his flight with dip reynolds there was a
repetition of the joking remarks and more praise for jimmy

  with two flights to his credit it was only natural that
jimmy should venture up again and again in the course
of the summer at the field

  mingling with the flyers day after day he learned the
lingo of their craft and studied the natures of these eagles
who were forever laughing at death

  all the while jimmy sold his papers gladly cashing in
on the extras when a flyer made his goal sadly when he
was claimed by the shadows of the unknown heights at
home jimmys talk was of flying and flying men so that
he became the envy of his friends in the gang and pos-
sessed the strange worried respect of his father and mother

  hes getting crazy on the subject mrs mccray told
her husband one night as she came from jimmys room
hes sound asleep up there-rolling around in his bed-
yelling contact-contact now vhat does it mean im
worried sick about him

  but john mccray himself a skilled mechanic only
smiled

t et him alone martha its the coming thing they
used to be dangerous-those planes-but theyre getting
them down now so theyre safe as the railroads

  jimmys mother paused in her evening labors

  do you know hes saving money to take lessons she
demanded every week he puts some in the savings bank
i declare he wont buy anything for himself every penny
has to go for his flying lessons

  the man nodded smiling

  sure and what he doesnt save ill give him myself
i can see jimmy right now a great man like lindbergh
maybe

  mrs mccrays eyes lightened

  well maybe she admitted jimmys just as good
as lindbergh ever was im sure-if he only had a few
lessons

  her husband laughed and placed his big hand gently on
her arm

  in the meanwhile jimmy slept in his dreams he was fly-
ing his own ship he saw himself as he had seen pictures
in lithographs of lindbergh with his hair whipping in the
wind his face streaked with grease his blue eyes gazing
out across the steel-colored sweep of the sea

  his mind had been particularly inflamed at the field that
stunt

day by an announcement on the bulletin-board in the office
it had consisted simply of the laconic statement that an
inspector would come the following day to test student
applicants

  jimmy had examined his pass-book carefully his bal-
ance in the savings bank would just about pay for ten les-
sons when they were passed if he made good he could
be ready for the inspector on his next visit he enter-
tained no doubts as to his ability so now in his dreams
he was flying

  at breakfast jimmy said nothing of his plans to his
mother

  now do be careful son she warned him as she always
did when he started away every time i pick up a paper
i expcct to see youve been killed in one of those crazy
things

  dont worry mums the only dangers in stunt stuff

xje kissed her and left the house hurrying immediately
to the bank where he drew out his money jimmy knew
of course that he might learned to handle the controls under
the guidance of his friends at the field but he had de-
cided early to pay his way and attain his goal as a pilot
by recognized and official methods from his friends he ac-
cepted flights and encouraged occasionally a bit of valuable
information but he intended to do his actual student fly-
ing with a paid instructor that was jimmys way

  accordingly he set out for the field this morning with
high hopes his blood singing in his veins

  oddly enough the student instructor was the one man
around the field with whom jimmy had little in common
to begin with because he charged for flights tom blake
was not in the habit of taking up dead heads for this
he was not to be criticized but nevertheless with his
keen boyish instinct jimmy sensed something in the man
that he did not like

  perhaps it was because blake refused to take him seri-
ously jimmy felt when the man looked at him that he
was laughing likewise in a vague fashion he distrusted
blnke and while nothing had been said directly there
seemed to be a wall between the instructor and the veterans
who used the field there was no doubt expressed as to
his ability in the air

  jimmy approached him this morning with a new degree
of confidence

  id like to start lessons mr blake-when youve got
time for me

  the instructor regarded him with amusement in his gaze

  you mean you want to learn to fly jimmy i thought
you knew all about it-the way youve been going up with
all these birds around here

  jimmy smiled a little embarrassed

  yes sir i want to learn i dont know anything about
it-yet

  blake laughed and it sounded as though a sneer was lurk-
ing in the background of his mind

  well well ill be glad to take you howll you do-
pay as you go along

  no ill pay the whole thing in advance

  jimmy thrust a hand into his pocket and withdrew a
roll of bills blakes eyes glistened slightly and he became
more interested a little more deferential

  we can start today if you want jimmy this after-
noon 

  fine ill be right here mr blake

  you better not eat lunch jimmy its different when
youre at the controls you know

  a thin note of scorn crept into the taunt

  oh ill take a chancc jimmy told him

  as he went back to the office to sort the early editions
jimmy found himself disliking blake more than ever

  so he thinks im afraid jimmy mused he figures
ill be sick-if i take the controls huh blakes due for
a surprise

  in die meanwhile blake joined a group of men in the
office beyond jimmys stand the boy could hear their
voices but until he heard his own name mentioned he was
too deep in his thoughts to heed them at that however
he stood upright and deliberately listened blake was do-
ing the talking

  yeah he said with a short laugh the kid came out
with a roll all set to fly you birds have spoiled him
hes got a swelled head before hes touched a stick be-
lieve me ill take that out of hint

  jimmy recognized dip reynolds voice in reply

  dont fool yourself blake that kids got the stuff
hell fly wilh any of us after hes done a hundred hours
solo hes a natural flyer

  go on scornfully youre full o hop the kids been
spoiled around here until he thinks hes lindbergh ill
bet you a dinner he comes down white around the gills
its a bet

  ill take that bet-and make it a suit o clothes devoe
made the new offer

  all right thats on any more

  jimmy scowled to himself

  ive stunted with him reynolds continued you cant
scare him that way

  did you ever let him have the stick

  no i didnt but i wouldnt be afraid to in a dual-
control ship like yours

  blakes laugh sounded again

  well ill eat heavy and wear good clothes on you two
he announced because this afternoon im going to
turn the stick over to the kid you remember the old
army trick dont you sling your own stick overboard

and let the student handle her alone well-

  whatll you do if he passes out on you demanded
devoe thats a dirty trick blake after all hes only
a kid

  whatll i do asked blake  why ill grab his stick
and bring her down-and collect from you birds

  outside jimmy turned to his stack of newspapers he
felt a sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach for he
knew that blake intended to carry out his plan somehow
jimmy told himself fiercely he would have to beat blake
at his own game-that or be a laughing stock among the
flyers and cause his two best friends to lose their wagers
somehow he would have to be worthy of their faith

  when most of the men were at lunch leaving the han-
gars almost deserted jimmy ventured in to examine blakes
ship he had chosen his time carefully it was a two-
seater dual-controlled monoplane painted a glittering red
the slim lines of the fuselage spoke silently of speed and
the big whirlwind engine told of power and endurance

he spent a moment or two in the passenger cockpit and
came down to stand admiringly beneath the wings
presently with a serious expression on his lean tanned
young face he went to the lunch-stand and ate a hearty meal
returning he met blake

  well are you all set jimmy

  yes sir im ready when you are

  did you eat lunch blake asked grinning maliciously
  sure-a big one

  youre pretty cocky

  jimmy was silent under the rebuff

  all right come on lets go

  blake led the way to the hangar sketchily he explained
the mechanics of the ailerons and the rudder the boy
listened quietly so engrossed did he become in the sleek
plane that he forgot his feelings about blake and his vague
uneasiness at the prospcct of their flight he followed the
man into the cockpit and received a brief lesson on the
instruments-gadgets blake called them carelessly

  heres your altimeter he indicated a dial marked
with numerals that tells you your height-or it ought
to theres die compass and thats the revolution counter


flying stories

down heres your switch there was evident contempt in
his voice as one by one he pointed out the instalments
and paused over each of them with laconic comment

  you got it all now he demanded i suppose you
know all about them anyhow

  no sir but ill learn

  all right hop in well soon find out

  jimmy climbcd swiftly into his seat

  now listen said blake theres one thing youve
got to do keep your eyes on me and do exacdy what i
do dont yank on the controls handle them easy and
if i signal to you to turn em loose do it savvy

  yes sir

  remember now blake warned him again do exactly
what i do

a t blakes signal a mechanic below pulled out the blocks

     the self-starter buzzed and the spark caught almost in-
stantly jimmys feet were on the rudder-bar in the same
position as blakes his hand gripped the stick lightly
he felt it move forward as the plane glided slowly out on
the field

  instinctively when they taxied to the line jimmy glanced
up at the sock on the tall pole the wind was coming from
the east with a swift glance at blake he pressed the
rudder and the ship turned into the wind then as he had
seen the other pilots do he jockeyed the stick as they sped
into the wind maneuvering to keep the nose of the plane
down until precisely the right instant for the take-off

  jimmy laughed exultantly as they left the ground on the
cushioned air it was the old thrill intensified owing to
his own share in the control he turned and saw the field
below and behind them a little group of men waved and
jimmy responded blake shouted at him unintelligibly in
the wind but he read his lips and more plainly his face

  cut it out watch what youre doing

  that jimmy decided instantly was the best advice he
had gotten from blake yet he proceeded to follow it his
tense nerves thrilled as he felt the swing of the stick when
they pointed up in a long climb a thousand feet and
still they were aiming at the clouds two thousand three-
the stick jockeyed and they straightened off suddenly
jimmys foot slipped as the rudder-bar was kicked and the
plane banked over sharply

  he gazed down across the wing straight at the ground
then up along the gleaming surface of the other directly
into space he grinned at blake exulting in the roar
of the engine the song of the wind in the taut wires
blakes centered the controls and they were on an even keel
again roaring on a straightaway

  four thousand-five-the altimeter needle shivered be-
tween five and six for ten minutes they circled like a
great falcon diving then straightening off to climb again
jimmy was watching his instructors movements with keen
eyes responding to blakes touch on the controls he cut
the gun and they idled in a vast universe where the throttled
engine scarcely sounded

  when the thing actually happened jimmy was totally
unprepared

  blake reached down and jerked savagely at his stick
pulling it from its socket he held it for an instant so

that jimmy might not by any chance fail to see his action
then with a leer on his dark face blake tossed the stick
over the side he leaned close and cupping his hands
shouted in jimmys ear now take her

  the wrench had sent the plane into a dive jimmy staring
down caught a last glimpse of the stick whirling toward the
earth bending low in a movement so swift that the pilot
could not interrupt it jimmy pulled his own stick from
its place and shot it out into space he looked up into the
blanched face of the instructor

  for a terrible instant blake was too shocked to act his
lips moved but no sound came his eyes widened in the
fixed stare of horror and his face became ghastly white
the plane was hurtling down with the engine on full speed
at such a time facts register in a strangely detached way
on the human mind blake saw the faces of the instru-
ments and read them subconsciously they had fallen a
thousand feet they were doing down at a hundred and
ninety miles an hour

  a piereing scream burst from the mans lips and he raised
his hands to shield his eyes from the sight of the rising
earth up up it came over the nose of the plane until ob-
jects below were curiously distinguishable they were over
a stretch of dense timber with the flying field far behind

  blake tore his shaking hands from his face to stare down
again and once more his lips opened a cry of terror
then oddly he sank forward in his safety belt hanging
limp with his head sagging on his chest

  blake had passed into merciful unconsciousness

  jimmy reached swiftly down to the floor beside him he
came up with a stick which he thrust into the socket
gently he drew it back to center then centered the rud-
der and the sturdy monoplane leveled off at two thousand
feet jimmy pointed back across the timber toward the
field when he sighted the familiar hangars the row
of planes on the line he circled twice and nosed gently
down

  straining now in his aftermath of fright he straightened
twenty feet above the field and edged down to a three-
point landing swinging the ship around he taxied easily
in across the line and switched off blake still hung in his
belt unconscious

tip reynolds was the first to reach the plane close
behind him came dusty devoe and half a dozen others
on all their faces there was anger

  whats the matter with you blake-pulling that stunt
stuff on the kid

  dip spoke before he recognized the figure at the con-
trols then his eyes widened he stared at the limp
form in the cockpit

  what-what the dickens jimmy were you doing that
nutty flying up there

  sure said jimmy grinning i couldnt help myself
blake threw his stick overboard so i threw mine too gee
it must have scared him but i took an extra one along
mr reynolds i wanted to play safe

  the pilots stared at him in amazement blake stirred
in his harness

  well you little son-of-a-gun exclaimed dusty if
youre not a pilot im president of mexico

conroy was hand-
ling his first big job

his heart was gay
and his motor
purred evenly as
he flew straight as an
indians arrow across the arid

wastes of death valley far far overhead a predatory
buzzard circled waiting for the desert to yield up its prey

  but conroy noticed none of these things he glanced back
at his three passengers looked down at the bulky sack
at his side and pulled back the stick slightly for the sheer
joy of feeling the ship respond to his touch conroy was
so happy that it almost hurt

  suddenly there whirred down from nowhere a high-
powered ebony-black monoplane

  pretty close muttered conroy but it would take more
than some fools reckless flying to disturb him on a day
like this he stretched forth his hand to wave a friendly
greeting when his smile froze to a ghastly grin

  seated in the cockpit of the other plane was a black-
masked pilot one hand on the stick and the other wrapped
around the trigger guard of a machine-gun conroy pulled
the stick back hard but the other was before him he
immelmanned and circled at breakneck speed coming into
perfect combat position over conroys tail

  a passengers scream fought against the roar of the
motor conroy stalled her and the ship commenced to slip
through the air but it was too late mercilessly the
synchronized lewis spat its couriers of death through the
fuselage three steel-jacketed bullets found their mark in
conroys back as he seized the stick in a bulldog death grip

  a fear-maddened passenger sought the wing as his
fingers groped with the cord of his parachute again the
gun spoke and a body hurtled through  feet of space
to the hungry canyon below

wind shrieked through the struts and the wires rattled

                               hideously as the uncontrolled
 ship gained momentum on her
 fatal journey down down
 she dropped and found her
 last landing place-a twisted
 charred mass of metal on the
 grim floor of death valley
 the field superintendent of the ralston airways line re-
 placed the telephone on his desk

 boys he said huskily that black devils got conroy
 the three pilots in the office stared at him in silence
 which jerry lawson was the first to break

got conroy he gasped when where

 they figure about fourteen hours ago explained the
 superintendent he was overdue at chihuahua no word
 of him they just phoned that a prospector found him
 crashed and burned to pieces with a half hundred bullet
 holes in the fuselage in death valley he and die two
 passengers were burned beyond recognition

 jfrry lawsons nails bit into his palms and his
 voice was a tremulous whisper

 damn him he muttered conroy was the best friend
 i ever had

 a tear streaked unashamed down his lean chcek

 davis and the superintendent looked at him sympatheti-
 cally

 steady old boy said the latter

 davis rose and put his arm around his shoulder

 yes easy old man he reassured him well get that
 murdering swine yet

 the fourth member of the group regarded them in toler-
 ant amusement

 whats the matter son he asked with biting irony
 even kiwis dont usually cry

 jerry flushed at this epithet-the airmans super-insult
 michelson he said im not ashamed of any tears

flying stories

i	shed over conroy he was a fine square-shooting flyer
and my pal and ill get the black killer if its the last
thing i ever do

  mad michelson grinned contemptuously

  youll get him he sneered when they want the
black killer theyll send a man after him-a flyer

  he paused for a moment

  like me he added and walked through the door

  jerry glared after him in impotent rage

  easy son counseled the superintendent again thats
just his way

  and it was just mad michelsons way he was the most
unpopular man on the field retained only because he was
as he boastingly proclaimed a crack flyer-a stunting fly-
ing fool with a dozen planes to his credit in the war

jerry sat  the bench as davis attempted to calm him
the superintendents brow was wrinkled in thought the
ell way company his chief rival had relinquished the pas-
senger and pay-roll service to chihuahua because two of
their planes had been crashed by a mysterious sky highway-
man the ralston company hardly believing the story
assumed the contract and conroy had taken out the first
run something had to be done he lit an ominous look-
ing cigar as the telephone jangled again

  he spoke tersely into the receiver and looked up with
a frown

  jerry he said it looks as if youd get your chance
when the passenger plane leaves wednesday with the pay-
roll you and michelson are to go as escorts

  jerry leapt up eagerly his depression of a moment ago
forgotten

  fine super he said the lord knows i dont like
michelson but on a stunt like that i guess hes the best
man on the field

  later on jerry climbed into the cockpit of his d h
and glanced at the throbbing curtiss beside him michel-
con ignored him with his lips set in a firm hard line he
tinkered with his synchronized machine-gun pulling back
the cocking handle on his own lewis jerry pressed the
trigger with a sharp click the striker shot forward into
the breech satisfied that all was in order jerry attached
the circular magazine

  contact he shouted and an oil-begrimed mechanic
jumped to obey

  michelson however was a second before him as jerry
revved his motor he watched mad michelson whip off into
the wind his wheels barely touching the hard earth and
zoom into the clear summer sky

  jerrys liberty pounded gaily on all her twelve cylinders
he jazzed the throttle and the planes smooth purring song
developed into a steady pulsating roar he eased her down
again and swung his right hand in a half salute obeying
the traditional gesture willing hands pulled away the blocks
and the low squat hangars whizzed past him as he dupli-
cated the perfect take-off of mad michelson

  flattening out as his altimeter registered  feet he
saw mad michclsons plane about a mile in front of him
speeding into the west like a migratory bird although
their last instructions had been to fly slowly and double
back to meet the mail plane jerry noted with some puzzle-
ment that the curtiss ahead was running close to her maxi-
mum speed

  glancing at the instrument board he found that his tacho-
meter registered  revolutions per minute and that his
air speed was somewhat over ninety with a slight tail
wind to help him along there was something up michel-
sons sleeve

  maintaining this rate for some minutes he suddenly be-
came aware of the gleaming gray bird that was mad
michelsons ship hurtling into the horizon leagues ahead
it was winging on at top speed using every ounce of
strength that its powerful engines could give

  jerrys sun-tanned brow wrinkled in thought michelson

 knew the orders what was he up to for a moment
jerry hesitated no matter what the other did his orders
were his orders it was his duty to follow them and render
protection to the plane that would soon follow

  but some strange second sense bade him follow michel-
son the more he argued against it the more the hunch
persisted he cast his eyes around the great circle of the
horizon in search of some sign of the lumbering passenger
ship or the swift almost mythical plane of the black killer

  almost instinctively he made his decision jerking back
the stick and throwing the throttle wide open he shot for-
ward and upward as the slip stream belched a veritable
gale behind him

  at  feet he leveled his elevators and came out of
his upward climb far down in the distance flashing in
the golden sunlight he saw mad michelsons plane the
blue smoke from her exhaust spitting steadily as she main-
tained her terrific pace he set his jaw grimly and fed
the d h all the gas she could eat

  on on he flew the earth whirling by underneath as
though for him gravity had been suspended closer and
closer he drew to the ship of mad michelson which loomed
larger and larger at each spin of the prop over the border
of utah over the skyward-stretching rockies on and on-
into the arid nevada wastes-on and on

  the gleaming curtiss was now but a scant few miles
ahead of the sturdy roaring d h to his left jerry saw
a lone mountain crag

  charleston peak he muttered in surprise

  in the zest of the chase it was hard to realize that he
had traveled so far-so fast he was about three hundred
yards behind michelson as they pushed over the forbidding
canyon of death valley in another mile he passed him
whirring by he noted the look of surprise that settled
upon the face of the other

  he glanced back over his shoulder and saw the curtiss
circle bank and volplane down toward the burning sands
below he killed his motor and swung the stick to the
left as his ailerons jerked into position he side-slipped
and joined the curtiss on its earthward journey suddenly
mad michelson thrust his head from the falling cockpit and
swung his hand in a low sweeping movement indicating
that he was forced to land

  they hit the shifting desert floor at precisely the same
moment the wheels plowing through the gritty sand and
the tail skids drawing a wavering line behind them

  jerry jumped from the cockpit and approached the other
plane as michelson crawled out from behind the stick

  so you got here he drawled

these words were meaningless to jerry who decided
that he had had enough of mystery

  whats the matter michelson he demanded

  the other surveyed him coolly his manner nettled jerry

  whats the idea he said angrily you break orders
you drag me out here you signal to land and then yon
tell me theres nothing the matter are you crazy 

  listen said mad michelson you want to find the
black killer dont you

  do you know where he is

  jerrys eyes lit up and his voice was eager

  son said michelson in a soft voice ive brought
you to his hideout i wanted to see if youd follow me
and now that you have ill let you in on it were close
to the black killers hangar

  jerry mentally forgave michelson the wild chase he had
led him he extended his hand impulsively

  michelson he said earnestly youre a brave man to
tackle the black killer alone and im glad you let me in
on it where is he

  michelson ignored the hand with a queer light in his eye

  come with me he said

  jerry followed mad michelson across the desert for some
two hundred yards despite this short distance and his
the menace of the desert



  perfect physical condition he found himself panting and
perspiring copiously the burning searing heat sucked the
very strength from his body it was incredible that what
was a mild summer day at the flying field could be such a
veritable hell in that appropriately named inferno-death
valley

  michelson stopped by the side of a projecting part of
the rocky canyon wall and waited for him still with that
queer dangerous glint in his eyes jerry catching up with
him stared in amazement for there in front of him
forming a perfect tarmac was an almost flat clearing in
the rocks in front of a huge darkened recess in the stony
wall as his gaze gradually penetrated the shadows inside
he saw that it formed a gigantic natural doorless hangar
and within like a vulture awaiting the advent of its prey
was that notorious cbony-black monoplane i

jerry looked excitedly at michelson who leaned against
the crag unmoved

  michelson he gasped his pulse pounding weve got
him how did you know

  michelson smiled a hard twisted smile

  we havent got him yet he said evenly

  well get him the dirty killer said jerry determinedly
do you know where he is

  michelson stared vacantly at a scampering coyote in the
distance for a moment in silence

  ill take you to him he said at last

  jerry was a little baffled at the others peculiar manner
but stifling a dozen questions that ran through his mind
he walked at mad michelsons side to the cavern entrance
he peered into the comparatively cool depths of the cave

  well where is he he asked impatiently arent we
going-

  he broke off suddenly as he turned around to face
michelson and found - himself confronted with the snub
nose of an unwavering automatic

  hes right here said michelson and his voice was
edged with hate right here waiting for the gallant young
air hero to capture him who did you think the black
killer was what flyer in these parts do you know who
has enough courage and skill to do the things lies done
im the black killer he almost scrcamcd in a tone that
sent an involuntary shudder down jerrys spine im the
man that you swore youd get for conroy im the man
thats going to finish you and get the passenger plane
as she comes through

  jerrys utter bewilderment must have shown on his face
was michelson really mad after all it seemed likely

  you dont quite believe me eh sneered the livid face
behind the automatic all right look

  he raised his left hand and without looking pointed to
the north jerrys eyes following the indicated direction
saw an inert black and gray object shimmering in the glaring
sunlight

  see that said michelson well thats your pal con-
roys ship-or whats left of it

  michelson jerry said steadily youre either a fietid of
hell or youre a madman i hope for your sake its the
latter put down that gun and come with me

  mad michelson threw back his head and laughed heartily
so he said with a final chuckle you come out
to get the black killer with words you should have known
lawson it wouldnt be that easy

what do you intend to do michelson jerry asked
michelson glared at him with distended eyes but his
voice was even enough he seemed calm and collected

  dont ask me questions he replied i give no warn-
ings when you discover what im going to do to you
itll be too late for you to do anything about it

  jerry considered this in silence for a moment before he
replied

  michelson theres one question id like to ask you why
did you crack up conroy

  mad michelson chuckled again in derisive amusement

  for the same reason i cracked up the other two planes
first i like money second i like a fight

  he looked at his wrist-watch and cursed

  enough of this come on shell be here in a moment
get over to your plane

  having no alternative jerry obeyed mentally trying to
figure out what the others game was

  hop in said michelson as they reached the plane

  jerry crawled behind the stick and adjusted the safety
belt as the other strapped a parachute across his back
michelson still gripping the gun clambered into the rear
cockpit jerry felt the sun-warmed pistol muzzle pressed
lightly at the nape of his neck

  take off said mad michclson in a low excited voice

  like a frightened bird jerrys d h scooted across the
vast plandess sands and climbed the canyon wall

  obeying michelsons signals from the rear cockpit he
tilted his elevators and soared into the east seeking altitude
at  feet mad michclson tapped his shoulder with
the automatic and indicated that he was to flatten out as
lie leveled off and stabilized his ailerons michelson seized
the controls in the rear-cockpit jerry turned his head
questioningly

  an instant too late he saw michelson come to his feet
with his hand upraised and his thin lips parted in a cruel
smile swiftly but not swiftly enough he attempted to duck
his head as he saw the butt of the automatic hurtling
down upon him he was vaguely conscious of a dull blow
then a vacant darkness rushed upon him

  the shock of the blow caused the sturdy d h to dip
her nose for a second but grabbing the rear stick mad
michelson straightened her out and doubling over the course
sped back to death valley he glanced at his watch again
and cast a hurried look behind him the big biplane was
due in about ten minutes

  cheeking his flying speed and seeking even more altitude
he locked the controls and gingerly crawled out upon the
port wing gauging the ground over a mile beneath
him he swung his legs into place hung for a thrilling
moment then let go

  for some seconds he fell like a plummet through space
and then as he tugged at the cord the pilot chute shot
out and dragged the big tent-like parachute after it mad
michelson floated gently down to his death-dealing black
monoplane while jerry lawson sat unconscious in the
cockpit of the speeding uncontrolled d h

  mad michelsons scheme was both cunning and simple
the unguided d h would undoubtedly sooner or later
strike a pocket which would start her on her downward
valedictory trip from such an altitude she would be
smashed to bits her unconscious pilot with her michelson
would blame the black killer and explain his absence
from the scene by contending that he had landed in the
valley to investigate the crash

tfle d h biplane whirred steadily overhead for a
time she flew as straight and true as though an expert
air-man were handling her a ground observer never
would have suspected that in her cockpit was huddled the
limp still figure of an incapacitated pilot

  straight up to the north she winged her reckless way-
when suddenly the inevitable happened her nose ran
into a bump and jerked up as she started upward at a
dangerous angle the tricky upward air draft hit her fuse-
lage moving her ailerons and elevators she gave a fright-
ened jerk like a horse shying at the unknown the momen-
tary hesitation permitted the weight of her engine to pull
her nose downward and with the engine racing madly she
started a devastating dive earthward

  down she flashed like a rocket gravity and motor con-
spiring to give her a speed that she never had attained
before ten thousand-eight thousand-seven thousand-
the altimeter went suddenly crazy the barographs quiver-


flying stories

ing arm spattered ink over the chart the instrument board
resembled a string of mad electric clocks the tachometer
alone kept sane indicating a steady r p m of 

  below there rose a green-topped lone peak at the northern
entrance to dealh valley like a lover keeping his tryst
the d h swooped down to meet it

  death valley prepared to greet another victim

  jerry lawson stirred and opened his eyes a terrific rush
of wind flung itself viciously into his face almost turning
his head but blowing a clear fresh draft of consciousness
into his befuddled mind for a second he stared horror-
stricken at the fast approaching mountain top then his
brain raccd before his thoughts were transmitted to his
aching muscles his flying instinct had moved his hands
he released the locks back came the stick jerked with
all the force of his strong young arms up went the ele-
vators the ship groaned and creaked under the fierce
strain she seemed to hang for an eternal moment above
the emerald crag his speed slackened and then as it
seemed she must crash to her doom she flattened out
thrust her nose up and reluctantly tore her way skyward

he leveled out and flew through the refreshing air he
could think more clearly up here than down below one
thought drove into his mind persistently he must get
mad michelson before the latter got the other plane he
banked circled and headed back to the south

  he had traveled some half-dozen miles when he saw the
big passenger-pay-roll biplane leaping along from the
eastern horizon it was too late to look for michelson now
he must see that the other ship got dirough safely first
he banked again and zoomed for more altitude if michel-
son should attack he-jerry-must have height for the duel
at  feet he came out of the upward glide and sailed
along in the direction of the passenger ship

  she passed some  feet beneath him unconscious of
his presence he circled about and followed her his flash-
ing eyes searching the sky for michelson a black speck
against the blue appeared

  though itching for the battle jerry kept his head and
his altitude in all probability michelson had not yet seen
him the tactics of the monoplane would be to rise above
the prey then flash down over his tail spitting a stream
of steel death

  holding the stick firmly and ready for any emergency
jerry watched michelsons ship stride into an advantageous
position in the clouds he pulled the stick back slightly
as high as the black monoplane went jerry climbed still
higher with his hand on his machine-gun he neared his
ceiling waiting for michelson to flatten out preparatory
to swooping down on the unwitting biplane beneath them

  at last the black ship threw her nose violently forward
and came out of her zoom in a trice jerry flung the stick
forward revolved the magazine of the lewis and shot
down through space michelson unconscious of the neme-
sis hovering above him dived also aiming at the tail of the
big gray bird below

  davis at the stick of the passenger plane looked up and
saw them frantically he jerked at the controls and side-
slipped down to temporary safety die black killer in

bloody pursuit from seven hundred feet above him jerry
watched michelson pull back his cocking handle setting
his teeth with a swift thought of conroy jerry was upon
him pie came out of his dive in combat position over
michelsons tail and before the latter was aware of his
presence he hurled a devastating barrage of machine-gun
bullets whistling through the black planes struts

  flying instinct alone saved the black killer even with-
out completely comprehending the situation he executed a
perfect immelniann belching whining s through jerrys
fuselage as he passed jerry killed his engine brought
his ailerons into play and dropped a sheer four thousand
feet michelson his engine roaring a legato song of hate
dived after him jerry leveled out flung the plane into a
zoom and squeezed the gun trigger as for an instant his
sights bored the onrushing murderous ship

  in a second michelson sped past him whipping a burst
of gleaming tracers into the side of the d h jerry shot
a quick glance to his left seeking the passenger plane
he noted that she was circling some four miles away as
though her pilot were considering the necessity of return-
ing to aid him he had no time for further speculation
however for the black plane was again rising to the attack

  they circled for a moment like two fighters sparring for
an opening twice michelson fired a short burst that
wasted itself on the empty air jerry held his fire until an
opportunity offered suddenly as michelson banked and
prepared to circle once more jerry dashed for his tail but
the super-speedy monoplane with mad michelson at the
stick was too much for him the black ship came up
quickly on his exposed side and he diought he was done for

  but this time luck was with him michelsons lewis
barked twice and was silent but not before one of the
slugs had eaten its way into jerrys arm pulling franti-
cally at the controls he awaited the final burst but it never
came looking upward he saw mad michelson his face
distorted with rage detach the empty magazine from its
post and hurl it violently earthward as the mad killer
fumbled beneath his seat for more ammunition jerry shot
up once again this time more successfully

  for fully five seconds he was in position over die others
tail round after round followed each other up the burn-
ing barrel of the lewis michelson dropped  feet but
jerry stuck in the dominating spot michelson wildly at-
tempted to swing out from under but stunt as he did
jerry remained on his tail unleashing his hurtling couriers
of doom

npiien there came from the black ship a silver liquid
spray and jerry knew it was over the gas tank had
been hit mad michelsons engine conked badly the killer
looked up at jerry with a peculiar resigned smile upon his
face his hand was off his gun and jerry held his own
fire awaiting the others crash

  but mad michelson waving his arm jauntily from the
cockpit thrust his stick forward and shot toward the yawn-
ing canyon below

  the black killer not waiting for the death he had so
often dealt to others shot down to meet it with engine
roaring and his prop blades singing a swati-song in the air
                   a daughter of daring swoops from the shy
                   to save her lover from his stnchenj plane

tilot jimmy blair flies to colonel davies
camp in the ungava in the wilds of
canada where a mysterious explosion has
taken place colonel davies who is seeking
a pulp-mill site has been threatened by two
mysterious strangers jimmy flies back to
the provincial police headquarters for assis-
tance being shot at from ambush as he takes off

   jimmy gets his message to headquarters where due to a mis-
understanding he is placed under arrest he persuades the po-
lice to investigate the trouble at the dames camp before sending
him back they find evidence that larson a city gangster has
made himself the leader of a gang of local ruffians and that the
lives of both colonel davies and his daughter linda whom
jimmy loves are in danger

   jimmy is returned to his base where he is grounded for dis-
obeying orders his friend farrell is sent to the assistance of
the davies farrell sends out another s os jimmys command-
ing officer relents and allows hi to go to the rescue of his
fiance he starts out in a heavy snow-storm with his plane
loaded with guns and ammunition sleet and snow make flying
very difficult

in the brief interval at sioux lookout new snow covered
the old so that when jimmy emerged from the office
with sergeants lawson and jenks in his wake he
broke a new path to the field the wings of the plane
were heavy beneath the coating of snow and in the
faint light of an oil lantern they worked to sweep it off with
their gloved hands

  lawson tried to dissuade jimmy from the flight

  even if you could see blair this snowll weigh you
down he protested and you cant land on tree tops

   ill get over it jimmy replied

  and hit sleet argued lawson

  jimmy acknowledged that but his determination did not
weaken

  shell roll through it-that distance he indicated the
plane

   they shook hands with him trying to conceal their convic-

tion that it was a last farewell jimmy
climbed into his cabin and played with the
engine turning it over slowly then racing the
cylinders the sound comforted him and he
waved at the men in the circle of yellow light
as he swung the plane into the wind and hit
the gun

  as he rose over the timber he looked back
two small dark figures still lingered in the circle of light
on the field although they could no longer see the fokker
whose song was growing indistinct on the wings of the wind

  for a time jimmy hung low over the trail that could be
traced dimly through the trees but for the snow he could
have followed it steadily through the night which was
scarcely more than a shadow of the dim gray day the plane
pitched viciously in the pockets and jimmy pointed up in a
long climb that brought him into the vast rolling clouds
heavy with their burden

  they lay in massive banks heaped one upon another so
that the plane still plunged through their wet depths at five
thousand feet he rose until the altimeter registered eight
and here there was a respite like a tunnel of air through the
clouds that lay above and below nowhere could jimmy find
a rift through which he could sight the stars

  he handled the controls mechanically while his thoughts
sped out through the storm to the camp which was his destina-
tion mentally he pictured the situation unaware of
siltons tragedy he saw him in the scene with rogers-both
of them barricaded in the davies cabin with linda her father
jerry warner and the terrified collins

out beyond ambushed in the timber larsen and brad-
dock with the others would be awaiting the moment to
rush the cabin if they had not already done so farrell with
two provincials would be working in from the direction of the
lake or perhaps fighting from the meager shelter of the
crippled plane at least jimmy rejoiced larsen would be
forced to divide his men

  the flashes from the exhaust played fitfully on the gleam-
ing wings and jimmy instinctively pushed down for a lower

flying stories

ceiling sleet glittered on the texture of the wings and the
loyal plane gave warning as it strained beneath the burden

  steady he muttered as though it understood

  we cant slip now old girl theres a job on
                       

  when larsen and his men pushed steadily into the forest
with silton half conscious in the improvised sling they
headed for the up course of the frozen stream that had first
led jimmy to their lair their tracks were plain in the snow
larsen seemed to have overlooked the possibility that they
would be followed or he had no fear of pursuit

  they came to the falls at length where the ice cascaded
from the rocks some fifteen feet above larsen turned off and
climbed half a dozen feet beside the falls

  well leave that here he announced curtly with a gesture
toward silton

rthen bending low he moved into a crevice and disap-
peared the others followed him into a cavern glittering
like crystal a natural cave that extended a dozen yards or so
into the hill during the thaws it would be flooded wiui water
from the stream a hidden pool where trout spawned and the
otter came to play now it was a perfect retreat with but a
single entrance through which a man must draw himself
with care

  the two men who were carrying silton dropped him brutally
on tlie icy floor

  sorta keep him on ice eh larsen one of them leered

  sorta

  the leader bent over silton and his hand went suddenly
to the white quiet face he rose quickly

  hell you guys dont know a dead one when you see him
he snarled that birds plumb stiff

  silton had gone on his last trek

  they grouped about him curiously exchanging strained
glances attempting rude laughter to sooth their uneasiness

  this is as good a place as any larsen said presently
theyre not likely to find him here frisk him braddock
maybe hes got something

  braddock went through the dead mans clothes on the
ice beside the body he deposited what he found there were
only the usual articles a note-book pencil some small change

  set a fire somebody commanded larsen abrupdy
bum that stuff an his clothes

  a heap of wood lay in a comer indicating that the cavern
had been used before likewise there were ashes on the floor
and the pure crystal of the ceiling was stained by smoke

  pierre you thought up something when you showed us
this place larson grinned at the native in a friendlier
mood than he had yet shown its worth a bonus to you
when we cean up with old davies

  eh he good place to hide pierres voice rumbled
strangely in the cavern as he responded to larsens praise
pierre he come here ver many time poleece he nevair
find tres bien

  larsen regarded him keenly

  you say the bulls never tracked you here he demanded

  pierre shook his head

  theyre wise guys though larsen glanced doubtfully
at the narrow entrance through which he could see the
edge of the tumbling ice cascade theyll follow us-if they
can

  the smoke from the fire hung low stinging their eyes two
men bent over the blaze slowly feeding it with siltons
clothes piece by piece the rank odor of burning cloth drove
larsen to the entrance with a muttered curse the stripped
corpse lay grimly exposed like a marble statue that had fallen
from its pedestal

  when the grisly task was finished larsen came back into
the center of the group indicating that he had something to
say they waited expectantly

  i figure we ought to clean up this job tonight boys he
said it wont be long now until that bull who got away will
have them down on us if this gang cant finish off them

people at the davies camp we ought to quit now  got a
hunch we ought to separate just before we get there

 he went on to describe his plan of attack assigning a
 definite duty to each man

 and i dont want the old man or the girl hurt you get me
 lie turned cold agate eyes from face to face

 ill take care of the girl he added

 a filthy grin came to braddocks face and his little piggish
 eyes glittered

 wont you need help boss

 if i do ill ask for it snapped larsen

 they listened attentively while he talked

 on the getaway he told them itll take two of us to
 handle the girl the rest of you split up i guess nobody
 here is afraid ill double-cross him is he

 there was no answer

 well meet in detroit as i told you at the start by that
 time if i aint mistaken daviesu come across there aint
 nothin to it if you boobs do what i tell you you dont
 want to leave evidence lyin around on a job like this the
 less they get on you the better chance you got if they ever
 put the bracelets on you get me

 his rasping voice was like a saw on metal in its harsh-
 ness

 when lie was certain that each man understood his par-
 ticular duty larsen proposed that they eat and go on from
 their shoulder packs that had been tossed to the floor the
 men began to withdraw their meager food supplies cold meat
 on slabs of hard dry bread larsen went again to die en-
 trance and studied the timber below in the direction from
 which they had come

 suddenly he wheeled and raised his hand

 shut up you-

 they fell into instant silence regarding him with surprised

 eyes

 theres somebody coinin up he lowered his voice come
 here pierre you got owl eyes

 the big man joined him peering down into the trees over
 his shoulder

 poleece said pierre in a sibilant whisper

 one demanded larsen

 by gar he same feller after us

 is he alone

 pierre stared out for a long minute and nodded

 he follow our trek he announced

 a s rogers came on with his eyes studying the trail and
 darting swiftly among the trees he gripped his rifle care-
 fully and kept in shelter when he could

 let him get up here said larsen coolly hes alone
 when he came to the foot of the cascade rogers moved
 around warily and for an instant was out of sight he re-
 appeared clutching at the ledge of ice for support

 drop that gun

 larsens blue-barreled automatic was thrust almost into
 his face

 rogers mittened hand slowly unclasped and his rifle
 clattered on the ice below

 welcome to our party said larsen with a bitter
 smile

 he stepped out from the crevice and rogers looked at the
 entrance amazed

 get in there snarled larsen keeping the automatic
 steadily on him we got a little surprise for you

 still silent rogers obeyed his eyes unaccustomed to the
 gloom of the cavern saw the figures of the waiting men in-
 distinctly at first he failed to see the naked corpse of
 silton at all then as his gaze fell upon it he gasped

 god he exclaimed swiftly turning away

 stand where you are larsens gun touched his ribs
 so you figured youd trail us eh braddock faced him
 leering

 close your trap larsen snarled im doin the talkin
 now his face was not pleasant to see
sleet



 he faced the provincial studying him with cruel eyes
 whats that joke about you birds always gettin your
 man he demanded scornfully you aint so good fellow
 rogers forced his eyes away from the stark corpse

 no he replied evenly i admit it

 wheres your flyin partner

 i dont know

 any more of your outfit in the woods

 plenty rogers told him grimly theyll get
    you larsen-sometime

 the man laughed

 thats a long ways off

 he half turned his head and spoke from the corner of his
 mouth

 well step on it you idiots get some string or something
 am i goin to stand here a week with this gat

 in a few moments rogers was again bound in rawhide this
 time with cruel knots eating into his wrists and ankles larsen

ninety and the plane was plunging heavily on its snow-bur-
dened wings

  jimmy cut the engine and turned down in a nose dive
hoping to shake oit the snow he pulled up when the alti-
meter needle quivered between the figures two and three and
leveled

  buck into it old girl he spoke impulsively pleadingly
in his desperation we cant crack up now not this close

  it was a prayer that kept repeating itself in his whirling
brain the cold had penetrated his furs and he was numb
terror was a new thing to jimmy blair and he was experienc-
ing it now in a variety of awful forms he listened to the
roar of the engine and saw the instrument board mechanically
as he worked the controls but his thoughts consciously
were below and ahead on the trail

  we ought to watch that trail he muttered somebody
might be on it

  instinctively he pushed down again until he could see the
wind-tossed trees the plane pitched and the struts whined

 the plane was out of control he thought of his chances with a
 chute had he possessed one and grinned picturing himself dangling in
 the air while the men helow picked him off at leisurej

 itll he quick this way he thought bitterly

 staring out at the revolving universep jimmy saw lmila s plane
 almost beside him she was leaning far out from the cabins signal-
 ing to him her hand pointed to the undercarriage of her plane
 suddenly the dizziness left his head he sprang to his window and
 climbed ouj clinging to the wires

 linda was trying to save him i

 ordered them to place the helpless captive on the floor

 over by his pardner there lie said with a short laugh
 two dead ones he added

 get it over larsen be a man

 rogers spoke evenly in a tone of resignation that indicated
 his complete surrender

 dont you worry larsen retorted itll come

 he turned away from the prostrate provincial to his men

 now heres what i mean by gettin rid of evidence he
 said we do the same thing with this one that we done with
 the other see we dont want no bodies found-an no
 clothes

 he paused and looked around at their faces

 anybody got a deck of cards he asked well cut to
 see who plugs him high man docs it

 there were no cards among them

 all tight then we all do it lie decided set him back
 against the wall braddock heres the idea see we line
 up here the cop sets there we all take a shot that makes
 all of us equals you might say

 braddock placed the trussed figure with back to the wall

 youre a soldier aint you asked larsen ever hear
 of a firin squad

 oh shut up larsen and do your dirty work
                      

 halfway to otter pass as his instruments indicated jimmy
 blair was flying at five thousand in air that registered forty
 below the zero point a headwind cut his flying speed to

 in protest at the strain blasts of wind shook the ship

  have to do it he said aloud only a little while now-
well find the lake

  ashe leaned forward in the cabin peering through the
snow-encrusted glass jimmy suddenly saw a fleeting shadow
flying at him perhaps a hundred feet over him he turned
out sharply banking staring

  it was a black fokker plane speeding into the south

  farrell he exclaimed

  he circled and shut off his engine reaching for the metal
clasp that held the windows closed the black ship came on
and dipped in signal turning out in a left bank

jimmy thrust his hand out and waved then stared from the
open window as the wind seemed to cut the flesh on his face
and drove the breath back into his lungs the pilot of the
other plane likewise jerked at the cabin window and in a
moment a hand waved bade jimmy still could not see the
face of the flyer framed in the furred hood half covered by the
leather mouthpiece

  then as he cut the gun and circled close while the second
plane swung in jimmy leaned far out they were flying
almost wing to wing in a wide turn the pilot suddenly
ripped at the masklike hood and threw it back jimmy gasped

  linda davies stared across the wings at him and she pointed
into the north with her gloved hand her hair tom loose
by the wind whipped back darkly from her white face she
was flying alone

  jimmy swept his arm in an arc signaling to her to turn and


flying stories

head back with him she nodded and drew down into the
cabin closing the window against the wind

  jimmy circled over her and together they headed into the
north he left his window open that he might stare down to
watch her careening ship as it bit into the night

  each shock of the erratic wind caused jimmy twofold
anguish as he stared down at the plane beneath him with its
precious burden a thrill of pride surged in him as he
watched her aware that she was flying with a skill that
equalled his own and a daring that surpassed his because she
was desperately afraid

  he could no longer bear to fly above her fearful that her
plane might buckle yet he knew that he would be helpless in
that event at any level nevertheless he went down and they
flew onward almost wing to wing with a scant distance
separating them

  linda waved and he saw her lips part in a reckless laugh a
gesture of bravado he thrust his head out into the gale
questioning her with his eyes straining his ears to listen for
the drone of her engine was all well with her instruments
was there ample fuel in the tank and were the controls re-
sponding as they should these and a hundred other ques-
tions he asked in his glance

tter reply was a quick touch on the stick and her
fokker dipped then rose in signal jimmy was unable
to hear her engine but he watched the blue flame as it spat
ceaselessly from the exhaust and marked that it struck as even-
ly as his own the motor then was functioning properly

  he studied the timber searching for the trail their
problem now if linda flew in safety to the lake lay in making
a landing on the dangerously small surface of the ice

  the feat would he knew tax her skill to the utmost failure
at a hundred feet would be more deadly than at five thousand
for she would have no time in which to right the plane if it
slipped then too his swift reasoning warned him there
would be larsen and his crew to contend with

  unquestionably they had heard lindas plane take off
jimmy sought to picture to himself the manner of her escape
farrell was out of it altogether otherwise he would never
have permitted her to take his plane the provincials would
be outnumbered by the men in the sheltering timber and
beyond a doubt larsen would be ready with his long range
rifles when two ships circled over the scene

  theyll pick us off he muttered damn them they
cant have her

  he dipped in signal and drew her attention again leaning
out leaving the controls free he waved in a sweeping gesture
to her trying to make her understand his meaning he
pointed up and made circles with his hand while she stared
at him across the space that separated them next he
reached to the floor of the cabin and seized a rifle aiming it
downward

  she nodded vigorously still watching him jimmy lifted
the barrel of the marlin gun bracingit against the wall of the
cabin again she nodded and he signaled for her to climb
while he himself pointed down linda appeared to under-
stand and lie saw her reach for the stick in the next moment
her plane commenced to climb

  when at length they came over the clearing where the
cabins huddled unprotected jimmy flew at a scant five hun-
dred feet watching for moving figures below linda was a
thousand feet above him holding her speed to his own hover-
ing like some great bird above its fighting mate

  they circled over the clearing once before jimmy saw a
puff of white smoke burst from the main cabin it was
followed instantly by another and answering puffs appeared
on the skirts of the timber toward the lake he swung the
forward window open and thrust the marlin gun outward
with its heavy butt resting on the ledge it was a clumsy
procedure yet lie knew that the steel-jacketed bullets would
travel farther and be more effective than any slug from rifle
or revolver

  he found himself longing for the old spad with the gun

firing through the propeller field in a vertical dive a sudden
burst from above the trees a swift straight climb at a thous-
and feet in fifty seconds-

  i could get them then he said sighting the marlin
throwing his weight on the butt to hold it down then he
pressed the trigger

  a hundred feet above the timber jimmy fired he saw the
first burst of steel plough up the snow and caught a fleeting
glimpse of men running back as the plane swung upward
jimmy turned his gaze to the circling ship that lingered above
him he heard nothing save the straining roar of his own
engine

  on an abrupt bank he returned and dived again firing as
the trees rose up over the nose of his plane for those few
seconds the controls were free and the ship was plunging with-
out guidance jimmy sprang back and straightened her
while he watched the scene below they were firing at him
now three of them who ran from the trees as he started up

  he saw a hole appear magically in one wing and grinned
they were getting the technique of it now he reasoned
swiftly they waited until he flattened off to climb then
came out from shelter to get him when lie could not fire back

  ever watchful of the plane above he swung around now in
time to see the ship move off in a direct line toward the lake
two miles distant jimmy hit the gun and went after her cir-
cling as she came down he saw the ailerons of her plane wiggle
in signal staring down toward the lake he sighted three
figures that emerged from the trees and waved then ran back
to disappear as shots puffed out frpm the timber behind them

  jimmy grasped the significance of this and waved to linda
as she brought her plane close farrell and the two pro-
vincials were fighting from the woods near where they had
landed larsen then had divided his men sending some of
them to attack the cabin while the others remained to kill or
capture the wounded pilot and his aides

  how then jimmy asked himself did linda manage to cross
the open sweep of the lake and reach farrells plane he
wondered too if jerry and davies could hold out much
longer at the cabin they could expect little aid from collins
he considered indeed it was likely that the weak-spined
secretary would secretly hinder them if he could

  jimmy leaned from his cabin again and pointed up urging
linda to a higher ceiling out of rifle range he saw now that
his most important task was to drive the renegades from their
hiding-place beside the lake thus he would be able to pro-
tect farrell and the provincials and at the same time create
a landing place for linda later he could renew his attack
on the men who besieged the cabin

  accordingly adjusting the marlin again he pointed down
first assuring himself that linda had understood his signal
her plane was up a thousand feet and climbing jimmy hit
the gun and dived he waited until he was almost over the
trees so that he could peer down between them then aa
a man sprang across an open space jimmy pressed the
trigger

hthe marlin spat its steel messengers in a staccato burst of

  death the runner below staggered before he got into shel-
ter then plunged his arms were flung awkwardly forward as
he went down and lay quiet jimmy laughed and pressed
the trigger again then leaped back to the controls

  there was a moment of strange significance a pause as
though the whole world hung motionless in its orbit the
engine abruptly slowed then burst into song again but
brokenly coughing the plane tipped over crazily on one
wing and started into a slip

  got me

  jimmys terse exclamation was synchronized with his
swift gesture as he took die controls toying widi the switch
the engine picked up then quit from its action he knew
that the gas feed was out of commission a bullet had ripped
into the tank

  desperately jimmy struggled to climb if he could gain a
decent altitude his instinct told him he would be able to
sleet



switch off and come down to a landing on the ice they would
pelt him with lead of course still he would have the plane
for protection and there was the marlin with half a drum
of ammunition two rifles and his automatics

  they may get me he told himself grimly but theyll
go through hell doing it

  the plane was climbing slowly uncertainly in imminent
danger of a tail spin looking up over the nose jimmy saw
lindas ship circle anxiously then point down she came
with her engine on full in a long steep dive when it seemed
that her ship would ram him she straightened and glided in
a circle banking over sharply on one wing she had opened
her window and was staring down at his careening fokker

  he waved motioning to her to climb back out of range
while his hand still hung out in the wind he felt the plane
slip and the engine die he dropped low in the office fight-
ing the controls in a last effort to save himself strangely
enough he experienced anger more than fear anger at the
cruel irony that had almost let him win and now was taking
the victory from him with so ruthless a hand

rfhe plane was out of control the rudder bar jammed and

  his efforts to loosen it were futile the wind shrieked
strangely in his ears with the drone of the engine stilled he
thought of his chances with a chute had he possessed one and
grinned picturing himself dangling in the air while the men
below picked him off at leisure

  itll be quick this way he thought bitterly

  linda would see him crack up the game was ended she
too would have to come down even if her nerves did not fail
her and send her down out of control larsen had won the
plane turned over slowly like an autumn leaf in the wind

  staring out at the revolving universe jimmy saw lindas
plane almost beside him she was leaning far out from the
cabin signaling to him her hand pointed to the under-
carriage of her plane suddenly the dizziness left his head
he sprang to his window and climbed out clinging to the
wires

  linda was trying to save him

  jimmy hung on to a strut with one hand and signaled his
understanding of her plan then swiftly his face drawn and
hard he crawled out on the upper wing as his weight went
out the plane gradually straightened the trees seemed to
be coming up at a terrific speed yet jimmy calculated that he
had twenjty scconds perhaps thirty

  for an instant it seemed inevitable that the two careening
ships would tangle she was coming down straight at him
at the exact moment she swung up the undercarriage
zoomed just over his head jimmy sprang for it both arms
extended in that dazzling instant he hung in space be-
tween earth and sky below lay certain death above was
the lone chance of survival

  his hands gripped the cross bar he was jerked into the
air and his legs swung up with a strength that came from
desperation he pulled himself into the space between the
v-shaped bars of the carriage and hung on already linda
was climbing he saw his plane plunge down and crash in
the trees

  until they had risen a thousand feet and were far out over
the timber jimmy gripped the rods staring down dizzily
at length sure of himself again he crawled to the edge and
drew himself up to the wing linda swung the door open and
he fell into the cabin numb from the cold half conscious
as sudden realization struck him with its full significance
in danger his nerves had functioned smoothly now for a
brief moment they faltered and jimmy surrendered to the
intoxication of relief

  he pulled himself together and made his way forward
beside the girl at the controls his hand fell upon her
shoulder she looked up into his face and her eyes were wet
with tears yet she smiled and spoke he read her lips

  good stuff jimmy blair

  he bent and spoke into her ear

  good girl linda davies

  they laughed oddly he motioned for her to quit the
pilots seat and she surrendered the controls to hiirt he
leaned down to the switch and his hand gripped the stick as
his mind took a new hold upon the will-o-the-wisp of hope

  jimmy circled back over the timber flying high now
risking no chance shot from the ambushed marauders below
he was reduced to a single weapon the automatic which
was strapped to his leg the rifles the marlin even the
second revolver had of course gone down with the doomed
plane

  linda saw him look at his automatic and read his thoughts
she leaned down in the cabin and from beneath the low seat
drew a rifle

  good he exclaimed thats what we need

  she could not hear the words but she understood them
and smiled she leaned close and called into his ear

  get over them jimmy ill take the controls you
take the rifle

  he refused instantly shaking his head in disapproval

  theyre too good with their guns he called back
weve got to fly back over the trail sioux lookout sent
men up theyre somewhere on the way

  they were over the lake again a safe two thousand feet
aloft jimmy looked down toward the spot where he had
last seen the marksmen lindas gaze followed his and an
exclamation left her lips there were three men running
across the ice one of them lingered behind the others
half dragging himself puffs of snioke from the woods told
of riflemen in shelter who had them at their mercy

  jimmy pointed down risking a shot to get a closer view
lindas hand tugged at his sleeve and she was suddenly
speaking into his ear her voice breaking with her emotion

  jimmy she cried theyve got them on the run that
man-that last one-is fred braddock his hat-you re-
member-

  he nodded abruptly and reached for the stick he did
remember braddocks peculiar headgear a high cap of beaver
skin that distinguished him from the others with their parka
hoods the running men paused to fire back into the timber
then started ahead as the plane pointed down they suddenly
raised their rifles

  jimmy turned in a steep bank evading their fire from
the timber there now emerged two figures shooting as they
ran at the men on the ice braddock went down jimmy
saw his rifle flung out from him as he sprawled swiftly the
scene became clear to him and he prepared to go down

  the rearmost men were provincials he made certain of
that as the plane circled low he half turned and signaled
to linda

  im going down he shouted lie down-keep out of
sight

che understood him and promptly obeyed jimmy head-
ed the plane down in a steep dive and laughed madly
the runners below paused looked back at the timber and
decided to keep on the fire from the trees was kicking up
the snow in little spurts about their feet their safety lay
ahead in the dense growth across the ice they left their
fallen companion and lurched ahead

  as the skis touched the ice jimmy wheeled the plane
around and hit the gun the engine roared and the ship
sped across the ice straight upon the fleeing men jimmy
scooped up the rifle and without waiting to rip the window
open fired through the glass he pressed the trigger again
and saw one of them slacken his pace and stagger

  the plane slid to a halt and jimmy sprang down shooting
as he ran the men ahead abruptly wheeled and threw their
rifles down lifting their hands high above their heads

  keep em up jimmy barked way up too damn you

  no shoot meestair poleece we give up

  he stared into the shifty eyes of the lean pierre the
second man white-faced bleeding from a wound he recog-
nized as one of the larsen outlaws

  wheres larsen jimmy demanded


flying stories

  pierre gestured toward the timber in the direction of camp
all right step ahead of me were going in after him
if he shoots boys he gets you first

  the provincials came running up with linda shielded
behind them jimmy recognized macbrair and clancy

  hello blair dustys back in the woods-hit he said
itd be you when we heard your plane macbrair greeted
him eagerly

  they regarded jimmys prisoners swiftly

  well shove on back to camp macbrair resumed
you watch these fellows and look out for miss davies-
arc rogers and silton back there jimmy interrupted
they returned his gaze blankly

  no they havent showed up

  jimmy nodded and his eyes were worried

  well all go in he announced weve got these fellows
to catch bullets-if they cut loose at us

  the provincials agreed and in a moment pierre and his
companion were inarching ahead the others fell in behind
them single file with linda following the provincials and
jimmy bringing up the rear

tthe little procession moved warily into the timber and
- halted at an abrupt command from clancy who was
following the prisoners

  therell be some trouble up ahead he warned with a
sidelong glance at linda this gang is waiting for us-
either that or theyve headed out you can count  it
theyll ait loose when they get a chance

  theyre too quiet to suit me said macbrair they
know somethings happened out here all right and farrells
over there in the woods alone theyre dirty enough to shoot
a man when hes down if they find him

  jimmy agreed with their remarks yet as he gazed at linda
he was uncertain for an instant

  we ought to stick together he suggested larsen and
his outfit will you can gamble on that if they head out this
way boys theyll run into us right now theres nothing
we can do about farrell do you know how many men are
with larsen in there

  four replied the provincial who had first spoken he
had seven to begin with when we came down counting
himself

  jimmy nodded

  lets take them  then he said weve got the trees
for shelter-and these men here if we need them

  the provincials laughed in unison glad of the opportunity
at last to settle the score for their lost comrades

  wait a minute jimmy swung on pierre look here
are there three more of you with larsen tell the truth now
tree pierre held up three fingers with larsen

  if any more show up jimmy told him quietly im
going to put a bullet in the back of your head pierre
pierre he tell you trut  the man protested

  they moved again among the trees speaking only occa-
sionally following linda jimmy constantly watched the
trail behind him and his gaze went cautiously into the woods
through which they passed

  how did you get farrells plane linda he spoke in an
undertone eager for an answer to the problem that had puz-
zled him since she first had signaled from the fleeting fokker

  they were fighting in the timber she replied across her
shoulder guardedly i waited until they got into the trees
they were like indians when i saw a chance i ran out
did they fire at you

  oh good heavens yes i thought at first theyd hit the
tank-or me but it was the only chance-

  how did you get out of the cabin

  i climbed out the window she told him they were
firing on us from the trees on the other side dad tried to
make me stay i knew we had to get help when i got out
 ran into the timber from that side of the cabin they
couldnt see me i circled around until i got to the lake i
could hear them shooting back there we didnt know how

many of them there were-it sounded like about about a
million

  gad that was pluck he lowered his voice still farther
and spoke almost in a whisper i love you

  she half turned to him

  you proved it jimmy blair

his face as she spoke became suddenly a taut mask so
swift was his movement that she saw only the dark gleam of
the automatic in his hand the spurt of yellow flame as he
fired a second shot spoke before the provincials could wheel
drop it larsen

  the name had scarcely fallen from jimmys lips when a
figure plunged from the shelter of a tree beyond the trail and
lay twitching in the snow jimmy sprang in front of linda
his automatic thrust ahead his eyes roving among the neigh-
boring trees

  theres another one in here he called back i thought
i got him

  a second bundled figure lurched awkwardly into the open
and he too went down groaning as his rifle whirled into the
snow

  ignoring the second prostrate form jimmy spun around
upon the first larsen had risen on his elbow his face was
twisted in a dying grin

  thats the breaks his voice was thin from pain and
his hand clutched steadily at his breast that was quick
stuff kid his rapidly glazing eyes gazed up at jimmy
you had it coming larsen

  i could have put it over on the hick cops-but you win
big boy-that was shootin

  jimmy kneeled beside him and lifted his sagging head
will you talk now larsen or are you going to take the
third degree at sioux lookout

  the man laughed weaklv talk he repeated what
the hell for

  whats your-your racket larsen

  the gangster gazed up at him incredulously you aint
wise to that yet

  they want you down in chicago i know that jimmy said
  larsen grinned they wont get me will they

  his head fell back  jimmys arm

  i come up here to get the daine lie went on slowly
you had that doped out i could of gotten away with it
clean too but i ran into these hicks they was after the
old gent so i played em for uckers hell they was for
bumpin him off i only wanted some of his dough

  so you used them for your own game larsen

  sure why not its dog eat dog in this racket bozo
  larsen sank lower and became a dead weight

  that said jimmy gravely is all the confession well get
from him

  this ones still kicking said macbrair we dont need
any more confessions blair weve got the goods

jimmy set down his burden and straightened to gaze into
lindas horrified eyes

  two more of them boys he said grimly and were
through

  it was all straight in his mind at last his first guess had
been accurate braddock and the rest of them had wanted
only to get rid of colonel davies then larsen with his
cunning had come into the ungava he had found his tools
waiting for him in the hardened men of the timber after
that the way had been clear-almost

  over his muttered protest they forced the wiry pierre to
shoulder the burden of his wounded accomplice mercilessly
he carried the man without regard for his hurt but mercy as
jimmy was aware had never been one of pierres virtues
they moved in silence as they neared the clearing there was
no sound ahead and one of the provincials went out in ad-
vance to reconnoiter he returned presently with the an-
nouncement that the two remaining marauders had evidently
decamped

  they went on still cautiously continued on page

the weather was fair above the reno air mail field in
the mid-afternoon of january   over the sierras a
matter of fourteen miles the weather indications did not

appear to be much worse than is usual during the storm
season when weather conditions are a bit changeable

  pilot burr winslow took off from the reno field on
schedule time he circled for altitude scarcely had he
reached a height of a few hundred feet when a murky
spume of mists began gathering heralding the terrific storm
that was shortly to follow so suddenly that the eye could
scarcely follow far far above the earth the monstrous




flying stories

the hump that treacherous sloping spot in the sierra nevadas that taxes the
skill and ingenuity of the cleverest veteran pilots once over the hump they are
half-way home this photograph was taken at an altitude of ft feet

petrel of the clouds stood still the glints of the lustrous
body could be seen hanging and shivering like a living lost
and frightened creature from another world

  some unseen power snapped the ship west like a flash
the binoculars centered on a dark spot revealed an air-
man in the cockpit the struggling plane was being manipu-
lated by a man with sinews of steel and muscles of seasoned
hickory a man with nerve and a knowledge of past achieve-
ments never before and never again was pilot winslow
called upon to meet a like condition

  overhead covering the entire sky above him and the
quivering man-made bird black clouds moved with the
velocity of light the thundering roar of the billowing
mists angry and white-rimmed swirled through the sky
with incalculable momentum along the sierra peaks there
was a wide stretch of clearness confined to the width of the
tops of the range this was an unprecedented circumstance
the elements were creating a scene comparable to that of
dantes inferno

  at the field the storm was so violent that it was feared
die hangars would be leveled to the ground the dust and
wind were terrific but as suddenly as it had started on the
ground it subsided to a -mile wind

  with straining eyes and shortened breath hundreds of
people between verdi and reno watched the sky winslows
plane was visible above the village of verdi as they
watched they saw the ship hurled this way and that as the
hurricane beat against it in the upper levels every second
they expected the ship to be battered to pieces she stag-
gered nose up then tail vertical rocking into almost a side-
slip then wonder of wonders at a point above verdi the
ship stood absolutely sthl a thousand feet above the village

  at the reno field the telephones were in use continuously
from ranch and farmhouses from spectators and townsmen
came telephone calls alarmed messages to tell of the plane
and pilot in distressseemingly suspended by some invisible
force in die misty dome under the blackness of the rising
winds

  one woman

hysterical from
watching win-
slows struggles
in the air called
die field from
verdi and cried
please please 
cant you send
help to the man
in the airplane
under the clouds
ive been watch-
ing him struggle
in the hurricane
tossed about like
a wisp of wild
cotton right above
our home he
has been driven
back and forth
like a flash of
lightning time
and time again
right over our
house the airplane
stands still then
it backs away to-
ward reno like a
wink then it
comes back again
to the same place
its just awful i
know the poor
boy will be killed
nothing human can stand that cyclone its tearing away
stunted timber along the rims of the high foot-hills please
please

   this is but one instance of the expressions of anxiety
the pleas that came to headquarters at reno during the full
hour and a half of winslows fight with the elements this
event will stand as a record in the official log at reno field
for all time

this hurricane tore in from the west and a bit north
then scattered in twisters in all directions there had
been no warning of the high velocities from any station
the hurricane passed in sweeps over the highest saw teeth
of the range then in down currents along the foot-hills and
on into the canons to the south and east in the extreme
western end of the great basin wherein reno is situated
the speed attained was rated at a hundred miles an hour
a thousand feet up from the ground

   over this same town of verdi the intersection of hun-
dreds of miles of canons and broad waste valleys the storm
center broke as it always does with the fury of a thousand
fiends turned loose

   the deceptive part of the storm was the view of the
hump for just a rim of black clouds showed along the
tops of die mountains the pinnacles roundtops and shat-
tered spires showed through and the sky seemed clear
traveling beyond this line seemed safe from the air there
was safety for the flyer if only he could escape the mael-
strom of angry uncontrollable winds

   the blasts ran wild and to the drivers imagination they
seemed to come from every direction of the compass how-
ever the ship waded and tore through under full throttle
for about a quarter of a mile above verdi there she
stopped stopped as dead as if she were tied to a snubbing
post the ship was level and seemed to be headed straight
into the blast throttle wide for minute after minute until
it seemed an eternity to them the watchers saw the phenome-
non of an airship standing still in the heavens
the mail must go



  my old boat stood still for what seemed to me an hour
said winslow afterward as a matter of fact we hung up
there for just an even twenty-five minutes say that verdi
hdl-hole of the air ought to be arrested and put away for-
ever well the blasts began to hit the ship with a force
that shook it just like an old swamp angel with an extra
dose of the ague never in all my flying did i have the
queer sensation that i experienced during that long station-
ary tie-up it was weird and almost inhuman i might
have been in another world

  it was a brand-new situation there was danger of being
turned upside down assuming all the positions a ship may
take to end in disaster i had the time of my life keeping
her snout down so she wouldnt go into a position where i
would have absolutely no chance to get her back level be-
lieve me i worked then i began to back up slowly at first
and then with a swish i glanced hastily over the side and
again  was over reno this shook me up a bit i had lost

	feet of altitude too i had been up to  when i
last noted the dial

  i still had hopes of making a crossing over the hump
and getting the mail down to san francisco the wind
took me in a wide circle back west again toward the cross-
over it was remarkable how quickly i reached  feet
heading the ship for the verdi whirlpool again i quartered
and reached the latter place in no time at all seemingly in
seconds bang i went against an incoming surge again
never had i experienced such a pounding against a ship
i almost gave up thought she would fly to pieces

  let me say right here we all have to hand it to the
motor macks for their care of these ships they make
them safe when a reno-built ship can stand what the
 did why there seems to be nothing in the heavens that
can destroy it the motor macks always function the
strains and stress of that flight make me proud to be part
of it all

  well he continued i stood still again in that verdi
spot the wind whistied like a thousand lost souls there
was a spong-spong as of harps intensified a hundred times
in the twang of the wires the covering of the wings
flattened down to thin paper ah over the ship there ap-
peared to me to be queer changes i had never bkore imag-

ined possible the darn business kind of got my goat for a
while i was determined to get that mail down below if
there was the remotest chance

  resting rather relaxing for a few minutes while the
ship stood at anchor upstairs i glanced at the altimeter
it was dropping at an alarming rate the down current
coming from off the high sierras swept up and rolled in
great billows about like niagara i figured out i was back
at reno again it was just-whiff-and there i was over
the university down again to  feet

  around the meadows over sparks i again took her with
nose up around peavine mountain swepther up to 
and down again i went into the verdi vortex no getting
past that barrier of savage intense wind which i had
found was over a mile thick that is the hurricane was
probably about that as near as i could judge there was
apparently no top nor bottom

at the third and last try for the top i saw the hump
had darkened and was black as night over the entire
range at that i took another chance believing i might get
through i made verdi again it was worse than ever i
succeeded in turning the ship again and came back to the
field doggone tough luck not getting the mail through
made me mad to default-

  goodness knows we have enough troubles without fail-
ing to get the mail over but when you cant you cant
thats all there is to it i am mighty glad i did not have
a passenger up there on that trip id have worried for
his safety

  this date january   will always be remembered
by the men in the united states air mail service at that
time and by each member of the personnel at reno and san
francisco as having the most remarkable wind and weather
of hurricane intensity in the history of the weather bureau
it is very doubtful if this exact condition will ever obtain
again over and along the topmost crests of the peaks of the
sierra nevadas for a distance of about  miles easterly
and westerly the sky was clear and bright the condition
was described by the two pilots winslow and vance who
made identical weather reports detailed the same air hazards
told of the awful fights they had and how the ships stood

flying stories

stationary in the high ether each told of the savage cur-
rents of air coining down on top of their ships and of how
their altitude dropped thousands of feet in a fraction of
time they related how they made three attempts to reach
their goal the famous hump how their ships sang and
trembled and how the  horse-power liberty motor was
like an ant hurling its puny strength against a locomotive
under full speed

  there was but one startling exception in the reports
and tales of their united parallel experiences

winslow fought against a wind coming out
of the west by a bit north vance made
hii great fight against the ele-
ments blowing from an

 a message re-
 ceived by mr
 bell the author
 of these articles
 from pilot clair
 k vance telling
 of a safe forced
 landing below
 is vance stand-
 ing beside his
 plane a few days
 before it was
 wrecked

from the reno field vance came along at record-breaking
speed with a fair tail wind until he reached a point within
a few miles of colfax calif colfax is about the same air
line distance from hump as verdi is from reno

it was here that he hit a bump that almost unseated him
the shock was like that suffered by a liner striking a
submerged iceberg then his batde began after the
first attempt to negotiate the roaring flow of winds
vance found himself standing still in the air mo-
tionless with the powerful liberty holding its own
against the immeasurable pressure singing its
song in the long roar of combat in defiance of
the kings of the whirlwinds the ship shook
and wavered with the jumpy increase of the
raging elements

vance watched for a way of deliverance
the change came with such suddenness that
it could not be timed the wave of
energy came from above the ship with
a terrific impact and down and back the
plane flew with supreme effort
the ship was headed tail-to in less
time than it takes to recount the
ship was driven back and hung
again over sacramento at 
feet with scarcely any motion

eastern direction to a few points north otherwise they jibed

  this was due to an unearthly abnormal splitting of the
hurricane by the colossal row of peaks along the sierras
a complete change in direction of the blow was created as
shown by the reports of die two airmen the great width
depth and height of the wind-flow was actually split and
changed in opposite directions

  these two pilots were doing the same things at the same
time and they were  miles apart in an air line neither
man knew of the predicament of the other until the next
morning it was then that they were dumfounded and were
convinced only after long argument that the wind had blown
in different directions divided as it was by the sierras

pilot clair k vance left the field at san francisco on
the same day and at the same time as did pilot winslow

  around the edges vance zoomed up up and up until he
calculated he had reached the ether above the wind flood
then he guided his plane for a straight line over placer-
ville and colfax for the hump

  into the cauldron of mixed and varying bumps he sped
and with a crash again landed against the full force of the
gale the crash tried both pilot and ship over colfax the
air conditions remained unchanged he turned the giant bird
again and found himself at sacramento with the same loss
of altitude

  it seemed inconceivable that the hump could not be
reached when it appeared so clear and bright from the
vantage of  feet above the earth

  once more he headed up into the altitudes and reached

	feet hoping to take flight with his mail into reno
the mail must go



with a default he reached the holes and bumps with an-
other awful pounding of the screeching winds went through
the same trying exhausting fight and saw the denseness
of the black clouds enveloping the mountains in every direc-
tion he gave up

  but he made the fight that will go down with winslows as
the most gruelling most unusual and thrilling one that a
flyer can experience over the  miles of territory there
was absolutely no landing for a set-down

  vance landed at mather field sacramento put his cargo
of mail on a limited train and headed his ship for san fran-
cisco a distance of ninety miles he broke into another
half gale and it took him one hour to make the field at crissy

  it was on this same day that major tomlinson field man-
ager at reno received official notification from the post-
master general at washington that the united states air
mail was the recipient of the collier aeronautical trophy
this prized award is the most sought after of all the cups
and rewards given
to every branch of
aeronautics in the
united states it
means that the
united states air
mail has a recog-
nized unbeatable ag-
gregation of experts
with resultant ac-
complishment in this
country

  there were other
times however
when the monotony
of uneventful sky-
riding would be-
come tiresome the
pilot would get
bored watching the
barren gay peaks
and the timber
growths below

then sometimes the

pilots would -come down dangerously close to earth and hunt
and prospect for a locality where there might be a chance to
make a safe landing in the event of sudden stress they
never did locate such fields the small frozen lakes in mid-
winter were the only landings they logged

  many times while off their runs they would take auto-
mobiles and go through the highways and byways of the
hump country and make every effort to find such a loca-
tion they always failed there was no such place one
chance they all knew and that was one in a million and
that was to head their ship down into the great tree tops
and gamble with death they figured this as their one
way out in that hundred miles

  every once in a while one of the boys would while
coming into reno note a speeding limited train far below
like a swooping eagle he would nose his ship down in
a long graceful angle he would cut his motor and
no thunder came from the liberty he would level

  off and then give her
the gun and like an
unseen force like a
stream of light he
would parallel the
running coaches and
glimpse the passen-
gers as they would
bump their noses
against the window
to get a look at the
big ship of the
united states air
mail t h e n t h e
pilot would grin in
delight at the con-
sternation he had
caused nose his
ship up into his level
of security get back
on his air road and
swoop over fhe
fields to the air-

hen he saw

dive from
twelve thou-
sand feet over gaurelle major jack savage
expected to watch another forced landing on the contrary
the little s e- looped back into the sky and arrowed straight
at three german fokkers that were riding on him in forma-
tion they parted as though a bolt of chain lightning had
crackled between their wings and savage grinned in the
next instant the r f c chaser had one ship wheeling
over in a slip and the other two were running

  there said the major quietly is a bird who knows his
onions id like to meet him

  that was early in may  when the allies were forcing
the germans back in the region of arras the western battle
front had been sagging down towards paris with the trium-
phant germans playing havoc on the pocked ground and in
the pocketed air but now the line bellied back up towards
belgium and the pilots of the r f c were celebrating

  foremost among the celebrants was young cyrus turner
the lad in the s e- single-seater with that drumming his-
pano-suiza motor augmented by a sputtering machine-gun
turner had joined the r f c at the age of sixteen he had
two hours of instruction and went up solo it wasnt long
until the german pilots began to think he had been bom in a
pursuit plane with his only toys the joy-stick the rudder bar
and a machine-gun

  major savage was destined to have his hopes realized he
met captain turner and they became fast friends they had
helped to write history in the sky over the lines now they
were to join in writing new legends in die air for major
savage had become the originator of sky-writing they
have at one time or another hung half-mile-high letters
ten thousand feet in the air over nearly all of europe and
the united states

  so successful had the novel method of aerial caligraphy
become that there now exists the skywriting corporation
of america which is the only concern of its kind in exist-
ence the company holds all sky-writing rights here and
abroad it trains pilots provides ships and tells the world
a number of things in great letters of smoke white against
the sapphire background of a clear sky

     

  allan j cameron is die
president he understands
men and is familiar with the
art of flying and he is as
enthusiastic about his work as the youngest flyer in the outfit

 the first time i saw sky-writing was over paris he told
me it impressed me so much that i flew across the chan-
nel to meet major jack savage he was the originator of
it you know well savage gave me the details

  mr cameron smiled reminiscently

  there was plenty of experimenting with it before the
war he continued but it didnt amount to much untfr
 it was in may of that year that captain cyrus turner
gave the first successful demonstration over the english
derby heand the others used to try all sorts of things-
and the ships in those days werent so reliable as they are
now you understand

  without recourse to his records mr cameron told the
story from the beginning calling only upon his photographic
memory as the new romance of commercial advertising un-
folded

  in those early days he recalled some of the pilots prac-
tised the backward system of writing on bicycles using wet
tires on the concrete before the hendon airdrome outside
of london

t ut they couldnt do a verticle bank with a bicycle mr

     cameron chuckled still they made an impression
on the concrete

  his face sobered as he remembered collie-caputin
c b d collyer the veteran mail pilot and round-the-
world flyer who crashed with harry tucker in the lock-
heed vega monoplane yankee doodle

  collie did our first job in america he resumed thought-
fully he wrote hello u s a his second job was to
write call van  that was our dbut in a little while
we had five pilots flying s e-s we advertised cigarets
and books and a lot of other things   

  good old collie hes got a higher altitude now than
he ever reached in a plane

  he relayed the story of events which first brought major
savage and captain turner together the major was in
paris with a group of people who were watching an air

circus carve one eagle after another in a succession of loops

  wouldnt a loop look great exclaimed one observer if
a plane could shoot a smoke streamer as she flew

  it would the major agreed

  and immediately it occurred to him that if a flier could
perform an ordinary o in smoke he could do a spencerian
with the rest of the alphabet and actually say something
then and there the idea was born after a series of trying
and unsuccessful experiments major savage at length
mixed a chemical and found a method that worked

  the chemical mr cameron explained is kept under
pressure in a tank behind the motor it is controlled by a
bowden on the joy-stick which is a sort of trigger when
the pilot is ready to start a letter he opens the valve by
means of this control the chemical is forced into the hot
exhaust pipe which is covered with asbestos to conserve its

heat this becomes the ink-or chalk-for the writing
the exhaust pipe rides along the fuselage and emerges
beneath the rudder as the chemical catches the heat in the
exhaust it becomes a white gas which expands when it con-
tacts with the air it then form a column of smoke about
five feet in diameter

  however said mr cameron the smoke-we use couldnt
be spread as a screen for protection because our chemical
is different from that used by the navy their stuff is
heavier than the prevailing atmosphere and settles ours
is comparable to the atmospheric pressure found at ten
thousand feet

the chemical itself is a dark thick mixture that re-
sembles crude oil the pilots call it gvbbins they couldnt
pronounce the scientific monicker if they knew it it is a
secret process which was used first in england in 
war birds occupy the control continued on page

flying instruction

  the united states air corps maintains a group of flying
schools where training is given at government expense in
piloting aircraft applicants may have heavier-than-air
airplane or lighter-than-air balloon and airship train-
ing in each case the course of instruction lasts one year

pay and allowances

  a flying cadet receives  per month in addition to
this he is allowed a ration allowance of  per day which
is sufficient to maintain a first class cadet mess uniforms
and other equipment are furnished without cost to flying
cadets a clothing allowance being credited to each flying
cadet upon reporting to duty cadets are transferred from
the point of enlistment to the flying schools and from the
flying school to their home at government expense

schools

  the air corps training center and the balloon and air-
ship school comprise a group of flying schools which with-
out doubt offer the best course in flying instruction available
anywhere in the world these schools are located in parts

   in this department each month the
 macfadden aviation advisory board
 will endeavor to answer all questions
 on the more serious and technical side
 of aviation address all questions to-

flying stories

of the country where the climate has been found favorable
for almost year around flying dius reducing the amount
of time lost by bad weather

  airplane course the first eight months of the heavier-
than-air training is given at a primary flying school of which
there are two one located at brooks field san antonio
texas and the other at march field riverside california
on the completion of the primary training the students are
transferred to the advanced flying school at kelly field
san antonio texas for die remaining four months of the
course

  courses start at the primary flying school on july  no-
vember  and march  of each year the primary flying
training consists of approximately  hours in the air dur-
ing which time the student receives instruction in all maneu-
vers necessary to pilot airplanes there is also training in
airplane engines navigation machine-guns radio and
other academic subjects necessary to a military pilot

  at the advanced flying school the training consists of the
following transition of service type airplanes cross-country
flying aerial gunnery special training in either pursuit at-
tack bombardment or observation aviation the successful
completion of the entire course at the air corps training
center includes approximately  hours in the air upon
completion a graduate is rated airplane pilot and com-
missioned without further examination as a second lieu-
tenant in the air corps reserve

  balloon and airship course this training is given at the
balloon and airship school at scott field bellville illinois
the course starts on september th of each year the
academic course of this school consists of such instruction in
military and theoretical subjects as are necessary to qualify
students as airship dirigible pilots including balloon ob-
serving the flying course consists of approximately 
hours in the air including aerial observation in captive bal-
loons free balloon flights airship flights graduates of
the balloon and airship schools are both rated as airship
pilot and balloon observer

  mechanics course the air corps has one school for the
training of air corps mechanics this is located at chanute
field rantoul  the course is of six months duration
and upon completion the pupil is rated airplane mechanic
and licensed as such

examinations

  when the application is approved by the war department
the applicant is notified to appear before an examining board
these examinations are usually held the second tuesday of
april august and december or at such other times as the
war department may announce and find necessary tha
examination consists of three parts and includes

  	physical this examination is to select physically nor-
mal applicants and eliminate those with defects or disease
which may become aggravated by flying training or which
would increase the hazard of such training all applicants
must take this examination vision must be normal that is
 for each eye without glasses the refractive error
must not be greater than one diopter in each eye

  particular attention is paid to the balance of the ocu-
lar muscles which must be within the established limits
normal color vision is required hearing must be nor-
mal and there must be no obstacles in the nasal passage
as for example enlarged turbinates or any disease or ab-
normality of the nose or throat the equilibrium must
be normal and there must be no tendency to nervous or
mental instability

  	education applicant may omit the educational ex-
amination upon presentation of documentary evidence of his
graduation from or satisfactory completion of two years
work at a recognized college or university if such evidence
cannot be furnished the examining board the education ex-
amination will be given

  all expenses incident to the applicants appearance before
the examining board for this examination is to be met by the

applicant and no claim for reimbursement of expenses in-
curred prior to enlistment can be considered

  the following is the general scope of the educational ex-
amination given those not exempt therefrom united states
history english grammar and composition general history
geography arithmetic higher algebra plane and solid geom-
etry plane and spherical trigonometry elementary physics

  the macfadden aviation advisory board will be glad at
any time to furnish the names of manuals and books in
which can be found all information to be mastered in the
passing of any of the above subjects

  	psychological great flyers are born not made a cer-
tain combination of psychological attributes not required by
any other activity or effort of man is a necessity to a satis-
factory pilot the majority of men and even a majority of
men who desire to fly do not possess these attributes years
of research and experimentation have enabled the flying sur-
geons assigned to the air corps specialized psychiatrists to
isolate the individual characteristics which go to make up
this combination which for want of a better term is called
inherent flying ability they can thus analyze the candi-
date and determine his potential value as a military pilot with
only a negligible degree of error this examination con-
sists of three parts -a practical test to determine the ap-
plicants reaction under various stimuli -a practical test
on an instrument called the ruggles orientator which simu-
lates the evolutions performed in flying -a personality
analysis by specialized flight surgeons

  all these tests are given all arrivals at theprimary school
a candidate is not considered as acceptable until he has
passed them they are incidentally the hardest part of the
examination to pass records show that more than twenty-
five per cent of all candidates fail in them the decision of
the examining surgeons in these examinations must be con-
sidered as conclusive and final from which there is no appeal
if the applicant fails in this examination lie is returned to
his point of enlistment at government expense thus causing
die individual little or no loss of money

completion of flying training

  	heavier-than-air upon successful completion of this
training a flying cadet is discharged from the service
rated an airplane pilot and is given a commission as
second lieutenant air corps reserve

  	lighter-than-air upon successful completion of this
training a flying cadet is discharged from the service is
rated an airship pilot and balloon observer and given a
commission as second lieutenant air corps reserve

  within the limit of appropriation all cadets are then
offered active duty with the air corps as second lieuten-
ant this duty is now for a period of one year while on
this duty they have the privileges pay and allowances of a
second lieutenant regular army men who contemplate
taking the competitive examination which is held each year
to fill existing vacancies in the grade of second lieutenant
army air corps regular army will be eligible for this
examination and are accorded certain exemptions and prior-
ity therein if they decide against taking active duty they
are free to return to their normal civilian pursuits

  it is needless for us to point out at this time that there are
many enviable positions in this field today due to the enor-
mous expansion of aviation and this is especially so with
army trained pilots if the applicants choose to return to
their civilian pursuits they are assigned to reserve units in
their localities and will be able to report for active duty for
two weeks each year if they so desire during which time they
will be permitted to fly all types of aircraft that are available
and on which they are competent during the remainder of
the year within the limits of available funds and equipment
they are permitted to fly at no expense to themselves in gov-
ernment airplanes at government flying fields this train-
ing offers an outstanding opportunity for the young men of
america to become identified with this most fast growing
activity
plane talk



 here is one of the most interesting letters which plane
 talk received this month interesting because of the many
 and varied questions which it contains

 gentlemen

    i and a few friends have been trying to figure out
 what an air pocket is and we dont seem to get anywhere
 you know how it is one knows more than the other
 and as i knew we would never gel to a decision i decid-
 ed to ask you is there such a thing as an air pocket 

 if so how does it act what causes it and at what
 height do you generally find it

    also i would like to know the following

    	what are bumps in the air

    	what is the best way to get out of a tail spin

    	at what height is a pilot supposed to fly in cross-
 country flying over a city 

    	is a plane supposed to take off and land against the
 wind or is it done for safety

    	how do you identify licensed aircraft from unli-
 censed

    	how long is an overhauled engine supposed to be
 on the test block 

    	how long can an engine be run before an overhaul-
 ing is needed

    	how many air miles does the average airplane get
 on one gallon of fuel

    	what effect has a supercharger on an engine

    	who hires mail pilots

    	are you a government man as long as you are
 transporting mail regardless of by whom you are hiredt

    well i guess this is all this time thank you very
 much for your service	sincerely yours

                                george moretto
                       derg hole ohio r  box 

 dear mr moretto

 in reply to your letter we are pleased to offer you the
 following information

 	air pocket is merely a slang expression indicating
 air currents which tend to go in a downward direction the
 action of the so called air pocket is to force the plane into
 a sudden drop all deviations of normal air currents are
 made by varying temperatures of the air such things as
 cold water shady spots such as woods etc cause air to
 descend these irregularities in air currents are found at
 all heights up to  or  feet

 	so called bumps in the air are caused by erratic mo-
 tion of air currents such as warm and cold air coming to-
 gether cross wind currents meeting passing over rivers
 deep gorges cities or any spots where air currents tend to
 be irregular because of varying atmospheric conditions

 	the quickest way to bring a machine out of a spin is to
 centralize the rudder and push the control stick forward
 this action will bring the plane out into a straight dive
 when the control stick is pulled back until level flight is
 again obtained

 	according to department of commerce regulations a
 plane is supposed to maintain a height of  feet or more
 when in cross-country flight  feet over a city

 	a plane should always land and take off against the
 wind this is done both for safety and to obtain the greatest
 measure of lift from the air currents when taking off and to
 obtain the greatest amount of break power or speed reduction
 when landing

 	you may identify licensed aircraft from unlicensed air-
 craft in the following manner licensed aircraft will have
 on the lower surface of the lower left wing and on the upper
 surface of the upper right wing the letter s aircraft used
 for government purposes or the letter c all other air-
 craft followed by the identification and license numerals
 unlicensed aircraft must display when in flight an identifica-
 tion mark assigned to it by the secretary of commerce this
 must be permanently affixed to the aircraft and is assigned

 to the aircraft owner upon application to the secretary of
 commerce this will consist of a number only no other
 letters or symbols must appear in front of the identification
 marks on unlicensed aircraft

  	according to air commerce regulations article 
the manufacturer of a motor is required to give that motor a
twenty-five hour running test and present to the department
of commerce a log of this run the test block run is one of
fifty hours endurance and is run in ten five-hour periods
during the first five hours the engine is run at full speed
during the remaining forty-five hours the engine shall be
run at approximately the rated speed and the horsepower
developed should at no time be less than the rated horse-
power

  	the average life of an airplane engine is  hours
without a major overhauling a good airplane engine can
undergo several major overhauls and should last from  to
 hours with these

  	a curtiss ox motor uses about eight gallons of gas-
oline to every sixty miles which should indicate that it aver-
ages around eight miles to a gallon other machines of later
manufacture give jnore or less according to their size weight
and load carried

  	the effect of a supercharger on an engine is to pump
in a greater or heavier charge of mixture so that the com-
pression will be the same at sea level as it is at great heights
despite the reduced air density

  	mail pilots are hired by private companies which con-
tract to carry mail for the government only government
mail is transported by the government by army pilots

  	you are considered a government man when trans-
porting mail regardless of for whom you work or by
whom you are hired

  we hope this fully answers your questions if we can be
of any further service to you please command us

                          very truly yours

macfadden aviation advisory board

  here is another letter which brought a generous batch of
questions we print it because we believe that the answers
will be of more or less general interest

  gentlemen

     i have a few questions to ask you they are probably
  very simple but have stumped me here they are

    how many horse poiver of work does a motor perform
  when it raises  lbs to a height of  feet in  min-
  utes 

    is the hisso a the  h p motor and e the iso
  are they air-cooled or water-cooled

    what is the difference between curtiss vi and
  supercharged v

     what is a cabane

     what is a  turn and a  turn as called for in
  the transport license

    would you advise an army or navy training

    would a course taken before going to the army or
  navy be of any great value

     what high school subjects wovld be the most benefi-
  cial

      have heard that many aviators didnt think allens
  plane with an aspect ratio of  to  would fly why
  not

    in the february copy of flying stories a mrs e

  r s gave you a bawling out for encouraging and ad-
  vising a boy to take up aviation if her boy is as inter-
  ested in aviation as i am taking books away from him
  will have no effect a person who really wants to get
  into the game is not likely to heed any advice to stay
  out

     if you know of any pilot who could spare a few min-
  utes writing to a boy of sixteen who is really interested
  in aviation please give me his address i would like to

   itas time to zorite about once a month

                                 your friend

                                   rudy brigiit
                          warren cheyenne wyo

     p s iu be waiting for your answer

  dear rudy

  in answer to your first question as to how many horse-
power is required to raise  pounds to a height of 
feet in five minutes we must first consider what a horse-
power is one horsepower is the amount of energy exerted
to raise a weight of  pounds one foot in one minute or
looking at it the other way around one horsepower will raise
thirty-three pounds  feet in one minute now as to
how many horsepower is required to raise  pounds 
feet in one minute you must divide  by  which will
give you - horsepower required to raise  pounds

	feet in one minute and of course you realize that it
would be the same amount expended to raise it  feet in
five minutes

  in answer to your second question the hispano-suiza
motor a is the  horsepower motor it is water-cooled

  the only difference between the curtis vi and the
supercharged v is that the latter is equipped with a
supercharger

  cabane is a framework for supporting the wings at the
fuselage and is also applied to the system of trussing used
to support overhang in the wing

   as to your next question a  turn is a horizontal turn
in the form of a complete circle which leaves the airplane
flying in the same direction as before it made the turn and
of course a  turn is just half of that and leaves the air-
plane flying in the opposite direction

  it would be impossible for us to advise you about taking
an army or navy training either is excellent a course
taken before joining the army or navy would be of little
use inasmuch as you get the finest aviation training known
when you become a- cadet in the flying corps

  we know of no special subjects that would be of benefit
to you in relation to a flying school in either the army or
navy but to join as a cadet in either of these services you
must have had two years of college work or pass an exami-
nation which is the equivalent thereof read requirements
above

  as to why many aviators do not think that allens plane
with its aspect ratio of  would fly we imagine it is be-
cause of the great amount of resistance that would be due in
such a ratio resistance increases as the aspect ratio be-
comes greater

   i will try to find a pilot who has the time to correspond
with you and will send you his address at my earliest op-
portunity

  thank you for your letter rudy its questions were in-
teresting and we hope to hear from you again

very truly yours

macfadden aviation advisory board

  dear sir

     i am seventeen years old and very interested in avia-
   tion both my uncle who is flying now and my parents
   are willing for me to take up flying as a vocation and
   are doing everything possible to help me through i
   have completed a general course in high school taken
   one year in technical work mostly on airplane engines
   and have taken a home study course in aviation hav-
   ing been physically examined and found fit to pilot a
   plane  am in difficulties as to my next move in
   your opinion should i proceed at once to a flying school
   or first take a year or so at college if i did the latter
   would i be roasting time

                            yours

                                vancouver b c can

dear mr west

   your most interesting letter arrived this morning and
i hasten to answer

   in the first place your age offers you opportunities which
the average man of more years can not have inasmuch
as you are asking my advice on this matter i am going
to tell you exactly what i should do if i were seventeen
today and know what i know now i have had many
years of experience in aviation both in the war and since
then and i realize only too well what an expert training
means in this field

   if i were seventeen as your are i would certainly go
to college where upon my graduation i would enter an
aviation school in which i could obtain a thorough and
exhaustive knowledge of aviation i take it from your
letter that such a procedure would be possible in your
case but if you found for financial or any other reasons
you could not complete your college course  would at
least take two years which would entitle you to apply to
the adjutant-general u s army at washington d c
for an appointment as a flying cadet there your training
would be free of charge and you would go to a school
conducted by the united states government where it would
take you one year to complete a thorough and splendid
aviation education with such a background the future
of any normal boy is assured

   if on the other hand your finances are unlimited you
could obtain the same education through any one of a number
of schools in the united states inasmuch as this country
boasts of the best equipped schools in the world today
please understand that i am not belittling home study
courses in the united states but it appears to me that
they serve their purpose by fitting men who are unable
cither because of age or financial ability to do that which
you can do

   education is the first stepping stone to accomplishment
and especially so when your vocation is a profession and
you must remember that aviation has entered that field
by all means go to college and then if the unusual should
happen and you should change your mind and decide upon
another vocation you would have a foundation that nothing
could replace if in two years or four years time i can
look back and see you have accomplished this and feel
that in some measure we were responsible it would make
me most proud if as you say your uncle is flying now
i am sure if you showed him this letter he would say
this is sound advice

   you can get training in less time than in the way i have
suggested but you are young and have plenty of time and
i am suggesting a way that will give you that little extra
touch which will place you above the others in the same
field of endeavor whether you accept this advice or not

i wish you all the luck in the world and would appreciate
hearing from you as to what you have decided to do

   if there is anything more that i can do for you in any
way whatever in this line do not hesitate to write me

very truly yours

                       he flies to the jlaiip oj the kidnapers

 a seaplane drops into long island sound near a
canocist pilot and canoeist change places the former
paddling ashore for a mechanic the canoeist discovers
coralie roweton in the rear cockpit he refuses to tell his
name and she nicknames him cross her father and sister
lenore arrive in a seaplane piloted by louis gregg all
return to the roweton yacht where cross finds himself
locked in a stateroom suspected of being the black cor-
sair ivho has kidnaped the elridge heiress

  mr roweton is knocked down by a stranger but a
search of the boat fails to reveal him

  romantic coralie helps cross escape from the state-
room in which he is locked swimming to the seaplane he
finds lenore there the yacht sails and as they start in
pursuit by speed boat a masked man pulls lenore into the
boat and pushes cross into the water cross returns to
the seaplane and is starting it when he is knocked on the
head and spirited away by the black corsair cross
goes overboard in a parachute he is picked up by another
speed boat with a girl in it they head for rowe tons island

  lenore recognises her captor as ted huntsley childhood
friend they run out of gas signal a plane by means of a
flare attracting the attention of gregg he takes lenore
from the boat leaving ted

  finding her unresponsive he takes her to her fathers
island they meet cross and the girl

  in the meantime mr roweton has spread the alarm that
the three men lenore and coralie are all missing

  cross lenore and gregg fly to southampton in crosss
plane as they step onto the landing float gregg surprises
the others by taking off alone cross is sure he can see
the plane which kidnaped coralie

cross was casting about in the darkness for a boat
with oars in it the motor of the flying boat
roared into action just as the canoeist muttering
a luridly disapproving description of his own men-
tality found a dingey among the tenders tied up
at one end of the float

  lenore scrambled into it before he could push off

  please she said when he would have stopped her and
he offered no further protest

  the flying boat with exhaust vomiting flame and roaring
defiance to the gale swept far down wind turned and was
in the air above the bay before the tender had gone a hun-
dred feet cross sending the light craft through the water
in great leaps at every swing of his body said nothing the
girl crouched in die stern her back to the torrent of wind
and rain and watched the piston-like sway of his body and
the whip of his long lean-muscled arms the oars churned
the creaming waves

  not until they were alongside the seaplane with the dam-
aged pontoon did cross speak

  one chance if this ship is gassed he shouted the wind
tearing at his words faster than greggs want to come

  yes-yes lenore cried

  for the tenth of a second he hesitated oars trailing star-
ing at her then lie gathered the girl in his arms balanced
himself in the plunging boat and with a quick sure move
swung her high up in the air and into the rear cockpit of
the seaplane as he followed the disregarded dingey
slipped into the darkness behind the pitching fretting
plane to lenore its disappearance was a sign they were
irrevocably committed to this wild venture

  while cross groped feverishly in the cockpit and finally




flying stories

found the switch and a miraculous little button that il-
lumined the instrument board lenore with eyes almost
blinded by the downpour followed the streak of red flame
that was fading vanishing in the black rain-swept eastern
sky an  as she watched it died away

  the starter screamed the propeller moved reluctantly in
little jerks round and round it went without a cough
from the motor then at the moment of despair came a
burst of sound a belch of fire from the exhaust that sent
lenores head ducking into the cockpit

  the motor thundered into its stupendous cacophony and
wind tore with tripled energy at the girls helmet as she
cautiously peered above the padded rim of the cockpit

  the seaplane took up the slack of its mooring in a nerv-
ous plunge ahead for a few seconds cross gave her the
gun shooting gas to the limit into her hungry cylinders
there was now no dissonance in that stupendous symphony
of power

  throttling down he slipped out of the forward cockpit
onto one of the pontoons cast loose the mooring and
scrambled back to his seat the mad wind seized die light
craft in its invisible buffeting arms and thrust it backward
over the bay into a region where pelting rain and cim-
merian night cut off the rest of the world like a dripping
sable curtain

cross let her drift a few seconds he hastily examined
the instrument board then he methodically moved the
stick backward and forward to work the elevators then
from right to left to operate the ailerons at the wing tips
the stick felt right and so did the rudder bar which his
feet controlled his hand went to the throttle

  the seaplane lunged forward like a thoroughbred under
the whip the pontoons cleft the water and the whole light
structure of the plane shuddered under the rack of the
racing motor but faster and faster the ship gallantly
stormed ahead bouncing more lightly now over the heaving
surface of the bay it was a matter of moments before
the clenched right hand of cross fixed on the little stick
that governed life and death brought his plane off the water

  for a breath more she hung level then rose sharply over
a deeper darkness that crept below the right wing went up
with a lurch and the plane veered around to the eastward

  once more lenore ventured to raise her head rain-drops
hard as hail at this high speed rattled against her helmet
and goggles and set her cheeks on fire the plane was no
longer charging directly into the gale but the sheets of rain
seemed nevertheless to assail her from ahead sweeping
horizontally through the propeller and under the upper wing

  a flame fierce and fiery as the breath of a dragon was
leaping from the right side of the motor roaring backward
along the linen-sheathed side of the fuselage and flaming
astern instinct warned that the hungry blaze would con-
sume plane and passengers reason tremulously denied the
danger real reassurance came to lenore when she drew in
out of the gale and stared forward through the tiny stream-
ing glass of the windshield

  she could see the head of cross motionless fixed pro-
truding from the other cockpit he was staring into the
chaotic gloom in front through the propeller sweep on the
weather side of the plane opposite the blinding flare of the
motor exhaust seemingly he paid no attention to the
flame to the biting rain or to the controls within the cock-
pit his whole being seemed concentrated on the task of
locating some faint glimmer of red ahead of them that would
indicate the whereabouts of the flying boat in which louis
gregg was speeding on some baneful mission

  lenore reluctantly released the clutch her hands had main-
tained on the seat since the take-off shielding her cheeks
with her palms she leaned out into the lashing wind and
with eyes narrowed behind her goggles searched the space
ahead

  above below and directly forward there seemingly was

nothing-not land nor sky nor water only the plane and
an aura of red-glowing mist and rain surrounding it seemed
real more fear-inspiring than the flame itself was this
mantle of scarlet enveloping the plane beyond was not
even blackness the earth was not all creation might
have vanished leaving this roaring mote alone in unten-
anted space

  lenore shuddered and turned her thoughts to coralie to
gregg to material things

  a sudden lurch threw her against the left side of the
cockpit for the first time she became conscious that she
was physically as well as mentally uneasy and strained
that clutch of hands on seat had been part of it she now
realized the reason the light seaplane was plunging and
rolling in sharper quicker motions than a small boat in a
rough sea it was swiftly parting a way through an ocean
of air currents gone mad that tension and swelling about
her heart was due to her apprehension of this farrago of
movements this dance of discord which must be resisted
by the slender outstretched wings the tiny wires and struts
the woven threads of linen cloth

  it was impossible to anticipate to compensate for the
crazy action of the plane now it rose slowly under her-
an ominous breath-arresting lift that slowed the beating
of her heart-then completed the rise in a sudden leap and
the next moment dropped from under her setting her heart
pounding frantically and her hands clutching at the cockpits
sides never could she prepare for what was coming   
she realized with a little start that she had been neglecting
her watch ahead she peered out over the side again stifling
a desire to scream for the sheer relief it would give her
nerves from that unbearable uncertainty

  the gaze of cross was set uncompromisingly ahead but
even as she resumed her hopeless straining of eyes he
turned and looked at her in the flare of the exhaust every
feature of one side of his face leaped into view lenore
gave a little gasp

  instead of the stern grey tight-lipped countenance she
had unconsciously visualized as belonging to that man who
was fighting his way through the tempest her eyes en-
countered the smiling broad-mouthed reddened face of a
cheery young man very much on the alert for trouble but
nevertheless enjoying an escapade to the full she felt that
his eyes were twinkling behind the shadowing goggles
there was nothing in him of coldness or reserve nothing
of apprehension or strain

  this new cross flicked his disengaged left hand over the
weather side of the plane like a man indicating a prized
possession simultaneously the plane reeled to the right

t enores heart jumped and her hands darted to her
seat as she tumbled suddenly against the side of the
cockpit the plane instantly rolled back to the horizontal
carrying a frightened lenore with it but there remained in
her eyes a dim vision of a blur of red light ahead and far
below them that had been revealed with that roll of the plane

  and the face of cross still turned backward revealed an
apologetic solicitous expression he motioned downward
and ahead in the direction in which lenore had glimpsed
that momentary flare and his lips framed the word
gregg

  lenore nodded violently and her fears slipped away into
the night like wolves slinking from a blazing camp-fire
there was nothing to worry about this strange young man
in the forward cockpit was conquering the storm without a
qualm he had discovered gregg-perhaps had seen him
from almost the first-and he was so undisturbed by the
fury of the elements that he ventured to bank his unstable
craft far to one side merely that she might have a clear view
of the quarry lenore felt a momentary desire to shout to
him not to show her the other boat again then she decided
that this was unnecessary his expression had promised
emphatically that she should not be alarmed again
high-handed



  as she sank into her seat touching the back of it for the
first time she experienced an overwhelming flood of curi-
osity concerning this queer cold quick-acting and daring
young individual in whose hands her life lay without
question she had agreed to fly with him through this terrible
storm and blackness in a plane about which she knew noth-
ing and he had never even told her he was a pilot

f course the need was urgent-gregg must be pre-
vented from reaching coralie at any cost-but who
was this young man to whom she had entrusted herself so
casually she did not know even his name and yet in-
stinctively she had trusted him the thought sent a thrill
through her half of pleasure and half of fear

  the motor roared on the exhaust flamed the seaplane
pitched as it held its unvarying place high in the wilderness
of hissing rain and air behind the heavier craft which was
unknowingly leading it directly to its unknown destination

moved forward as the nose of the boat grounded gregg
flung them the anchor rope barking nervous commands
then he sprang ashore directed the paying out of enough
rope to moor the boat in deeper water and commanded the
trio to make fast the line to an axle of the car the wind
was still tearing at land and water in spasmodic fury but
the rain had almost ceased

  thatll hold her gregg announced after an inspection
of the mooring he fumbled in his pockets for a cigarette
ive had the devils own time of it but im back

 and why you had to go away again like that is what
beats me growled the smallest man of the three who had
awaited the pilot he was a meager little specimen whose
knickers and gaudy golf stockings revealed reedlike legs
but despite his size his beady eyes snapped in the head-
light glare as he faced louis gregg

  you aint the only one thats had the devils own time
the short one continued unabashed by the pilots answering

  she experienced aru overwhelming flood oj curiosity concerning
this queer cold quick-acting and daring young individual ins whose
hands her lfej lay without question she had agreed to fly
with him through this terribles storm and blackness ins a plane aboutj
which she knew nothing and he had never evens told her he was
a pilots

  of courses the need was urgento-gregg mus- be prevented
from reaching coralie at any cost--but who was this young man
to whom she had entrusted herself so casually she did notj know
evens his namep and ye instinctively she had trusted him

   the thoughts sentj a thrill through her half of pleasure and
half of fear

  and away to the eastward whence clouds still charged in
from sea on the wings of the storm the impenetrable dark-
ness was lightened by a faint grayness just above the
horizon

  louis gregg hunched over the left wheel in the operat-
ing cockpit of his big flying boat peered ahead into the rain-
swept gloom with a scowl on his face he glanced at the
luminous hands on the dial of the clock set into the instru-
ment board and the worried lines in his forehead deepened

  short ugly words dripped from his protruding down-
turned lower lip not even a perceptible let-up in the pelt-
ing of the rain softened his distorted countenance then
suddenly he ceased to scowl and the hang-dog twist of the
under lip changed instantly into a charming smile

  the cause of the metamorphosis was obvious ahead
and a little to the right two white lights whose vertical
beams seemed to pierce th storm easily burst into view
simultaneously they winked out and on three times then
their glare was uninterrupted after a moment or two
their beams were depressed one at a time so that they
played upon the uneasy water at the edge of a sandy shore
gregg throttled down with a grunt of relief

  as the land was to the weather side the water had not
been lashed to fury by the wind with the aid of the two
lights gregg dived banked and set his cumbersome boat on
the water without difficulty he taxied toward the beacons
and cut the motor just before reaching the gently sloping
beach

  three men who had been standing beside an automobile
whose powerful headlights had been the landing lights

stare while youve been gallivanting around in the air
hells broke loose right here

  whats wrong hance gregg snarled impatiently his
fingers ceasing for an instant their manipulation of match
and cigarette

  here let me tell about it interposed another of the
trio roughly thrusting his raincoated form between gregg
and hance in spite of all our precautions this place has
been discovered another girl has turned up

  gregg muttered an imprecation

  thats just what i was going to tell you when that
wind-bag butted in hance broke in dodging around the
taller man and confronting gregg yeah a new girl blew
in on us and theres trouble at the house

t cant understand- began the man in the raincoat
    raising his voice in contest with hance

  shut up both of you snarled gregg they subsided
somewhat sullenly now meigler if you can tell me just
how this happened go ahead only shoot it fast

  meigler bestowed a triumphant but fleeting smile upon
the little man certainly i can tell you he said lowering
his voice confidentially we were all three up at the house
listening to pen elridge chatter about being abducted
how it feels to ride in a flying boat and so forth when-
aw put some snap into it bo demanded hance danc-
ing restlessly about in the wet sand the cops will be here
before you spill it tell him cantcha tell him

  gregg swore impotently go on man

  there was a knock at the door-this was before the


flying stories

storm you know-and we were all thunderstruck knowing
it couldnt be you well we hustled pen out of sight
hance opened up and there was this girl

  how in blazes did a girl get way out here at night with
the road practically impassable demanded gregg his eyes
passing distrustfully from one to the other

  aw she give a song and dance wit variations about
falling off a yacht and not wanting to yell out because her
old man was sore at cr hance interpolated swiftly
said she swum ashore that goil kin lie fastern pen kin
talk

  she fell off a yacht gregg ejaculated his jaw dropped
and he knitted his brow a yacht he muttered

  outn the channel hance corroborated derisively yeah
we seen a yacht out there but that dont prove nothin i
think shes scoutin for the cops the boat was turnin
round like she says and the skirt claims she done an un-
willing kellerman out a porthole while climbin to the floor
above and she comes here because were showin the only
light in miles

  whats her name meigler the pilot demanded suddenly

che said meigler began emphasizing those two
  words that her name was coralie roweton

  what greggs eyes blazed his cigarette twisted to
shreds dropped from his hand

  thats what she said repeated the man somewhat be-
wildered by his chiefs intensity boss i think were in a
trap here and wed better flit by plane before they close in
on us

  be quiet the pilot commanded turning his back on
meiglers anxious countenance im doing the thinking
here coralie roweton god what luck he was mut-
tering to himself taking short strides up and down the
beach ive got her here-here-and were still safe can
i work it ill show that icy sister of hers id have fixed
her anyhow but-where is she

  i asks her if she is sure the empress of china didnt
fall off the yacht too hance put in failing to note the
blazing exultant eyes of his chief but all she-say
whats eatin the boss anyway he stopped his flow of
words to stare at gregg who had swung about at meiglers
nod toward the bungalow and now was dog-trotting up the
beach

  meigler followed the pilot but hance paused to address
the silent third member of the trio a huge man in a pea
jacket who half stood half sat against a mudguard of the
car with his powerful arms crossed on his chest

  i wonder does the boss really believe that line about her
being one of the roweton gals the little man speculated
say wouldnt that bull the game if she was wowie boy
but wed be cash in in big wit two golden goils to dicker on
wouldnt we kid

  the giant cogitated

  yup he vouchsafed at last but hance did not hear the
decision the talkative little man was legging it after
gregg and meigler the giant perceiving on emerging
from his intellectual fog that he was alone lumbered in the
same direction

  up at the head of the procession a few yards below the
house on the dunes gregg had paused for a word with
meigler

  of course youve kept the two girls apart-neither knows
the other is here he said eyeing his lieutenant keenly in
the dim light

  meigler moved uneasily how could we boss he mut-
tered pen came sailing back into the living-room as soon
as she heard a womans voice

  you brainless fool gregg raged in sudden fury do
you know what that means all the careful alibi ive built
up is endangered maybe ruined i how do you suppose i
can work anything safely now

  meigler wilted incoherently voicing explanations and apol-

ogies gregg shoved him aside with a curse and strode up
the wooden steps to the bare porch of the ciapboarded un-
painted bungalow he paused struggling with his wrath

  itll take all the stuff ive got and the luck of- ive
got to get away with this or were sunk i

  he walked in

  no chatter of girlish voices impinged upon his ears in-
stead he entered a silence as thick as a thundercloud in
the stuffy little room to the right on either side of an oil
lamp sat two girls each apparently under the impression that
she was the sole occupant of the bungalow

  one was a dark-haired black-eyed young woman some-
what spare of form and sharp of countenance clad in sport
attire of the most pronounced cut and of no subdued color
she sat stiffly in her chair and her hands were uneasily
active in her lap but it was quite plain to gregg after a
single glance at her smoldering dark eyes that it was anger
not embarrassment that dictated her attitude

  the other girl upon whom gregg looked with suppressed
anxiety was coralie roweton she had chosen a rocking
chair and flung herself into it with an easy grace that lin-
gered in her present attitude she was quite obviously com-
fortable and cheerful this was strange because she was
clad in a sweater that undoubtedly was the father of all
sweaters the property of the laconic giant without and her
attire was completed by a pair of wrinkled and far-gone
trousers that spread abroad the fact that they undoubtedly
once-and not so long since-had been intimately connected
with the fishing industry certainly few girls would have
been happy in such a costume yet coralie was emphatically so

  both girls looked up at the sound of the opening door
but it was coralie who won the trick in a flash she was on
her feet in another flash she had given gregg both her
hands and the most entrancing smile in her ample stock

  so you are the black corsair louis she trilled and
then with one of those swift stabbing feminine glances to-
ward pen eldridge she chattered on

  tell me do how much do you charge for abducting
a girl

  for just a moment the audacity and dash of her greeting
robbed gregg of his usual glibness of tongue but it was less
than a moment before pen eldridge flew out of her chair
and confronted the pilot

  louis are you going to let this-this creaturc-say
tilings like that right to my face her lips worked con-
vulsively and she shot venomous eyes from the gay coralie
back to gregg if you dont send her away from here this
instant- her voice shrilled to incoherency

ves yes of course dear louis gregg murmured
- soothingly and laid a hand reassuringly though some-
what gingerly upon pens arm im afraid youre a bit
upset by this storm and my unavoidable absence but im
back safe now

  i am not upset shrieked pen eldridge

  no not precisely upset he agreed hastily but just a
little bit anxious dear 

  the girl had taken refuge in a handkerchief and her reply
was inaudible gregg patted her back mumbling sympathy
and contrived to shoot a smile at coralie over pens bowed
head

  well coralie i see youve discovered my little secret
he said amiably

  pens head came up with a jerk

  dont speak to her she shrilled

  come now dear i must be polite to her you know
louis gregg gently remonstrated shes our guest you
mustnt forget that

  the dark eyes of miss eldridge shot sparks and when
you get through talking with-with this castaway perhaps
you may want to talk to me but im sorry to say that
you wont be able to because after waiting up all night and
suffering agonies of torture and torment for you through
high-handed



the storm im going to bed im completely exhausted

  she whirled around evading greggs protesting hands
and swept with head high through a door leading to the
rear of the bungalow the door banged shut

  the instinctive movement of restraint that the pilot had
made changed with the shutting of the door to a gesture of
indifference before coralie had removed her interested
eyes from pens dramatic exit greggs attention was con-
centrated most flatteringly on her the girl in the hand

  say look here mr gregg coralie burst out in unem-
barrassed amazement do you mean to tell me you fell in
love with her and had to kidnap her to make her love you

  the frankness of this seemed to hit louis gregg squarely
for he blinked as if hit when he spoke it was with a philo-
sophical gentleness of tone that would preclude the possi-
bility of his voice carrying through that closed door

  love is a strange thing coralie a strange thing he
said and there was melancholy in addition to philosophy in
his moving voice it is true that very recently i was madly
in love with that girl

  but you arent now coralie asked promptly and indeed
somewhat eagerly

ltis eyes backed by an inscrutable face searched hers
intensely then flicked away he did not speak as he
led her gendy to her rocking-chair for a moment he stood
tensely before her his face flooded with anguish he passed
a weary hand through his hair tousling the long locks

  coralie she doesnt understand me he intoned hollowly
and collapsed into a chair with elbows on knees chin
resting on his hands he stared mournfully at the bare wall
of die room she loves me but it is the surface me the
pilot the-the good-looking young man that she sees when
she looks at me but she does not understand the real me
my depths my soul

  his fixed agonized gaze was broken by a swift glance
at the girl she was watching him her eyes big with some
strong emotion

she does not understand you-the real you she breathed

  thats it exactly gregg agreed sometimes coralie
i have hoped-yes even diought that you although i have
seen little of you have penetrated to depths of understand-
ing of me that she will never reach

  coralie blinked you-you think i understand you
she asked softly

  yes he declared firmly and turned to lay his hands
lightly on her shoulders his handsome eyes searched hers
it may be audacious of me even impudent of me but i
think you do

  coralie faced him without the slightest movement of re-
sponse or of protest at his sudden caress then slowly she
averted her head

  i-i do understand you louis gregg i do she whis-
pered

  his dark eyes blazed with triumph and in his moment of
exultation they did not note that coralies own eyes con-
cealed beneath her long lashes darted a keen unmaidenly
glance upward at his flushed face his arms moved toward
her but at that moment coralie leaned backward a trifle
instantly he abandoned his purpose and drew back

  but tell me louis did you really just haul her out of
the water and carry her off despite her struggles coralie
inquired

  louis gregg smiled from a pocket of his leather coat
he withdrew a letter this is a secret coralie but im going
to let you in on it he murmured with a cautious eye on
the door through which pen eldridge had vanished i have
here a letter written by pen-quite voluntarily you know-
to her father in which she states that she was expecting me
to land for her at southampton and that was why she swam
out so far

really said coralie gazing with frank interest at the
envelope that would come in handy if the county police

or whatever they are got hold of you wouldnt it lucky
you havent had time to mail it

  for just a moment a frown formed on greggs brow he
looked at diis naive young girl with a shade of doubt and
perplexity in his expression but her clear young eyes alight
with admiration dwelt upon his unwinkingly



  the instant that gregg throttled his motor and started
maneuvering for a landing was one of immediate action for
cross

  the red will-o-the-wisp that was leading the two pursuers
in their lurching plane through the wilderness of damp
black intangibility was square in cross line of vision
when its glare flickered and faded away like the dart of a
snake the tall pilots hand leaped to his own ignition switch

  to lenore tense in the rear cockpit came stunning anni-
hilating silence and darkness her universe-a thing of
streaking flame and rhythmic thunder-was instantly blotted
out for a moment stupefying absolute blankness and
silence incomprehensible utterly terrifying prevailed then
as die girls heart plunged wildly in her breast there came
a feeling of sinking and a gradually rising wail of demoniac
triumph rioted in her ears shrilling through her head

  a voice as welcome to her as air to the lungs of one
drowning came back through the darkness it shouted above
the devilish screaming

  hes landing i cut to prevent them from spotting us
by the flare of our exhaust

  w-what is that  lenore quavered

  a laugh a real casual laugh soothed her that noise
just the taut wires between the wings singing us a tune
sound spooky

  dreadful cant diey hear it down there

  not a chance were too far away and as long as
you hear it you know were in a safe glide

  it didnt sound like a safe glide cross spoke no more
and somehow lenore sensed a certain tensity an increas-
ing vigilance in him although she could barely make out
the loom of his head and shoulders the plane whistled
downward with little lifts and drops that affected her like
brief electric shocks staring straight ahead past cross
figure and through the slowly rotating propeller lenore
vaguely perceived a thickening of the gloom that indicated
land-or water

  they were very close-how close she could not judge-
when cross suddenly banked the plane sharply to the right
and headed directly into the faint greyness that lightened a
segment of the horizon they struck something with a jolt
and lenore felt the plane leap upward again like a startled
horse she saw cross lunge suddenly forward in the cockpit
and the plane as if in response nosed down leveled off and
jounced easily over the water ahead lenore could see a
darker line of blackness that must be the shadow of the
dunes

  ross breath whistled outward through his mouth
rotten landing he muttered his voice depreca-
tory but lenore was not deceived

  you didnt think you could do it at all in this dim light
she accused he turned and peered at her heedless of the
plane which was already drifting away from the dimly
sensed shore

  hm he remarked his surprise manifest thats pretty
good mind-reading i did think we might have a bit of a
crash

  the next instant he was scrambling down onto the pon-
toons with the planes patent anchor in his hands

  have to warp her in he explained we could swim
for it but i dont want to desert our only line of retreat
we might need it if for instance greggs got coralie in his
grip already

progress was slow for the plane drifted backward each


flying stories

time cross pulled up the anchor for another heave toward
shore he worked manfully with perspiration dropping
from his forehead lenore discovered that she was shiver-
ing and cramped in her cockpit but she did not offer any
assistance she knew could be rated by a busy man only as a
drawback

  unremitting effort finally brought the seaplane to shal-
lower water

  good only three feet deep cross cxclaimed much
gratified and splashed overboard with the end of the rope
slung over his shoulder he toiled ahead through the shallows
when the plane grounded he dug the anchor into the beach

  come on lie called and lenore climbed slowly out of
the cockpit her tingling feet feeling their way suddenly
she found herself in the pilots arms he swashed through
the water and set her upon her feet on the firm sand with
a matter-of-fact thump

  well here we are wherever here is he remarked peer-
ing this way and that through die gloom around them was
nothing but mist and sand the noise of cresting waves still
snapping angrily at the dying breeze filled their ears unchal-
lenged by other sound the grey in the east was now reach-
ing out over the sky

rthe outlooks a bit bleak but we have the edge on
gregg anyhow cross commented cheerfully after a
close stare at the rather drooping damp figure that stood be-
side him we dont know where we are but we know where
gregg is and he thinks were back in southampton

  i do hope we can prevent him from reaching coralie
lenore said clenching her teeth to prevent their chattering
if we could only find her 

  he landed about half a mile or so down the beach as
near as i could judge from the air cross said thoughfully
well have to move cautiously for we havent the least idea
of what kind of game were playing we may run into a
den of cutthroats or even a practical joke all we know is
that he had somebody on the watch for him on the ground
he looked at the girl compassionately

  i know youre dripping wet but we cant risk a fire now
he spoke soothingly as if to a child the disconsolate
figure straightened and he felt her eyes upon his face

  if you think im downhearted youre mistaken she
retorted with brave indignation it-it feels a little dryer
when i dont move much and thats why i slouched but
im ready to go after gregg this minute

  he chuckled immensely relieved good come on 
he commanded and tucked her hand under his arm in
friendly fashion were off

  he sprang ahead at a dog-trot and lenore ran lightly
behind catching up in a few steps their feet spurned the
wet sand in unison as they jogged along and soon a warm
glow pulsed through her cramped body the air became
crisp rather than piercing as they breathed it and the east-
ern sky gave more promise of a sunlit day

  their spirits rose with the coming sun and the quickening
of the sluggish blood in their veins they looked at each
other and without reason laughed gaily the beach un-
reeled with marvelous speed beneath them and the retreating
shadows revealed a clean fresh world from which rt seemed
all trace of man had been swept by the storm

  the swish and thud of their feet on the firm moist sand
had come to be an unceasing rhythmic refrain as much a
part of life as the plash of the waves when cross finally
came to a reluctant halt ahead the shore made a slight
turn projecting dunes sparsely covered with coarse grass
barred the view

  greggs landing place cant be far beyond this point
cross said keeping his voice low probably it is just
around the turn lets look around

  their gay abandon of the run along the shore changed
to slow caution as they advanced to the shelving bulk of the
dunes and peered around the curve

  a few hundred feet ahead they saw greggs big flying
boat tailing out in the water beyond a mooring rope well
above the high water line a black touring-car stood motion-
less there was no one in sight but above a bungalow
set upon the dunes a plume of black smoke trailing toward
the water indicated that people were up and about

  after a moment of scrutiny of the peaceful scene cross
and lenore retreated a few steps and faced each other

  if we only knew lenore murmured her face revealed
her anxiety and cross hastened to speak

  the whole gang is probably at breakfast he said even
crooks must eat the question now arises what do we do

  lenore besought his answer with an appealing glance and
he continued

  plan no  watch and await their next move plan
no  crash in on them now

  wed know what to do if we could find out whether
coralie is there lenore ventured wrinkling her brows in
a little frown of perplexity

  only one way to discover that cross decided crisply
go up and do it thats what i intend to do

  but these men may be desperate criminals lenore ob-
jected with sudden warmth

  im feeling rather desperate myself cross said his
eyes gleaming suddenly he picked up a piece of driftwood
heavy from the months in the water but stout as ever i
hold a theory that all the desperation in that bungalow can
be cured with a bit of wood judiciously applied

  he halted an enthusiastic sweep of his club to add with
a tinge of regret

  but somehow im depressed with the thought that gregg
is playing a game into which force doesnt enter

  how can you say that-if he is the black corsair
lenore interposed doubtfully at least he forcibly kid-
naped penelope elridge

  cross shook his head dubiously im unable to back
up my theories with facts but i feel im right he insisted
ive met some hellbenders at various times myself and he
hasnt that cut of jib hes a pussy footer a soft-soaper
but hes an aviator-an accomplished flyer protested
the girl surprised and incredulous that proves hes
daring even reckless

  cross laughed ever since i first watched him handle a
plane ive felt hes no bold bad man flyings no sign of
a sporting spirit these days its as safe as motoring and
not so dusty lenore hes a bit too ladylike in the way he
handles his ailerons

  lenore considered this technical criticism somewhat
doubtfully and refrained from speech

tm going to call on him now-taking this club to pre-
vent misunderstandings he announced you watch
from here if i wave to you its safe to join me if not do
what you think best after seeing what happens something
will happen all right you are sure to find cottages and
people down the beach in the other direction

  i want to go with you lenore protested emphatically
im not afraid of this man no matter what he is

  no you cant lenore cross said gently you must
think of coralie you know

  but- the girls rebellious eyes dwelt upon another

stick of driftwood on the beach lighter than the mans but
substantial nevertheless

  in cross face a sudden transforming light seemed to
glow for just an instant as he followed the direction of
her eyes the wrinkles the paleness the weariness van-
ished and he took a step toward her then he stopped

  if they jump us both coralies out of luck he reminded
her his tone low but insistent as a matter of fairness to
her-

  well the girl said reluctantly i suppose youre right
but-

  i knew youd see it that way he interrupted hastily
high-handed



his relief ill-suppressed heres hoping see you later
for an instant he paused and again he took a big stride
that brought him close to her the girls eyes fluttered shut
as his arms loomed about her but with a reassuring pat
on the shoulder he turned and walked around the point

  swinging his driftwood club with careless ease he made
his way down the beach lenore taking cover in the grass
on the dunes watched him with wide eyes while her finger-
nails dug tiny half-moons in the palms of her hands

hphat interview with coralie which had begun so prom-
- isingly for louis gregg did not move along on die ten-
derly confidential lines planned by the handsome pilot
in fact about the time diat cross was sloshing his way
toward shore with the seaplane towing jerkily behind him
coralie gave the little talk a decidedly novel twist
evading die ardent arms of the suddenly love-struck
black corsair she leaped to her feet like a startled tigress

  yes i understand you louis gregg i understand you
right down into your inner being where you keep your
withered wits she blazed disdaining to retreat behind die
chair you couldnt fool lenore with your silly blather-
ings on the yacht and you cant fool me either

  for just a moment his poise deserted him he stood
staring amazed at the girl whom he had so underrated
at that instant in her fearless defiant indignation she was
superb commanding then girl-like she realized what a
splendid figure she made and youthful self-consciousness
overwhelmed her she-laughed scornfully but there was a
hint of the theatrical in it louis gregg recovered him-
self an air of indifference replaced his obvious surprise

  you compliment yourself coralie he said smiling
indulgently because i chose to amuse myself by thrilling
a silly child and talking twaddle you think you see through
me well you dont

  there was such a grim cold menace in his voice as he
snarled the last few words that coralie blenched that
sudden transformation was like storm clouds overwhelming
the sun

  im tired of talking to you she said hurriedly her
eyes on his she slipped around the rocking-chair and sidled
toward the outer door

  stop shouted gregg and sprang after her coralieu
hasty walk became a run she flung herself at the door
but as her hand seized the knob the panels between her
and freedom resounded in a sharp rat-a-tat

  the door swung inward coralie dodged and leaped
through the opening

  grab her gregg commanded outside on the porch
his three men about to file in fell back in confusion then
little iiance flung his arms about the fleeing girl and the
other two closed in about them they brought her back
into the room

  put her in that closet gregg directed indicating a door
on the other side of the cottage you- his eyes picked
out the giant-stand in front of it

  hance watched the order obeyed in silence but as soon
as the door closed on the sobbing girl he turned to his
superior

  we been doing a little thinking outside boss he began
speaking slowly as if picking his words carefully these
other guys have asked me to put it up to you

  what do you mean demanded gregg frostily

  hance jerked his head sideways toward the closet door
well theres somepin fr instance what do you expect
to do with diat goil keep her in the closet till she dies
of old age or hit her on the head

  meigler who had been fidgeting uneasily raised his hand
in horror at hances curt words but the litde man turned
on him like a darting snake

  shut up hance commanded harshly and then swung
back to face gregg see here gregg when you signed
me on as mech with these other fellers you told us the game

was tricky but not dangerous but you was damn short on
information now me im willing to take a chance in the
air or out of it if theres a hunk of cash in it for me but
meigler hes getting all upset and hysterical-like what
we want to know is when do we cash in and beat it every-
thing was going great till this other girl blew in but now
it looks like youd lost yer grip

  you think so do you gregg said calmly whats
wrong is diat youve lost your nerve all three of you
well if you think you can get out of this mess widiout me
when all long islands on the lookout why go ahead

  he paused a moment but although hance started to
speak he thought better of it gregg went on a sneer in
his voice

  that girl in the closet youre so excited about simply
means about twenty thousand cash for us ill tell you
flat the game with the elridge girl was absolutely safe
id fixed things so no court in the country could touch us
but now weve got coralie roweton as well and were crim-
inals back out of this now and  see you do time witli
me stick and i promise you big money its up to you
the big man who stood with arms akimbo before the
closet door looked at hance meigler shuffled his feet un-
easily the little spokesman looked at neither of them he
was absorbed in a shrewd scrutiny of gregg

  when hance spoke again there was a conciliatory note
in his voice me im game to go through wid it but this

bimbo- he looked contemptuously over his shoulder at

meigler is gettin jumpy

  no no meigler exclaimed hastily you misunder-
stand me but i would like to know just what has nap

pened and is going to happen that girl- his voice

trailed off weakly as he looked toward the closet

  yeah said hance whats die lay boss where
do we skip from here

  youre with me then gregg asked still icily indif-
ferent

  sure we are hance assured him aint never been
anything else but whats die scenario of this mix-up
simply this replied the pilot by ten oclock today-
within five hours-this affair will be over i will be a
happy bridegroom with a wife who is wealthy in her own
right i will have not only the rosy prospects i mentioned
to you before but a substantial sum in hand which will be
divided among you that will be your bonus for the added
risks-and perquisites-miss roweton lias involuntarily
brought us

  maybe so boss maybe so said hance doubtfully
but i dont mind telling you since were confidential-like
diat i had my nose to the winder there when pen elridge
breezed out o the room and she didnt look like no blushin
bride to me shes more likely to get you pinched than
marry you the way she slammed that door

tah said gregg scornfully eavesdropping well
get out of here all of you and in five minutes ill
have her looking like a bride again lock that closet door
first though

  with stolid precision the big man turned the key in the
closet door no sound of protest came from within

  hance moved uneasily the other two looked at him and
under their obvious desire for leadership he finally moved
toward the outer door gregg surveyed his three follow-
ers with a sardonic smile

  remember he said if you want to come out of this
safe-and rich-just obey my orders and dont ask ques-
tions ive got a big surprise coming keep your nerve
and sit tight when it breaks

  theres too many blasted surprises in this bunco party
muttered hance discontentedly but we gotta stick were
in too deep to get out widout a lifeline silently the others
filed out behind him

  left alone gregg turned to the other door through


flying stories

which pen elridge had made her sweeping exit the de-
risive twist of the lips with which he had looked upon his
aides was still upon his face as he went toward it he
knocked softly

 pen pen he called gently with a note scarcely
 louder than an echo that hinted of distress in his voice

 there was no answer and no stir that he could hear he
 knocked again somewhat more insistently pen he re-
 peated i must speak to you at once

 go away i wont speak to you a muffled uneven
 voice wailed behind the door

 im sorry gregg said regretfully i did so want-
 but never mind pen

 the door swung open pen flushed of chcek and with
 eyelids somewhat swollen stood before him

 what do you want the girl demanded

 rthe pilot instantly took possession of her hands and
 his head drooped over them

 pen pen he murmured what do you think i want
 to quarrel with you on this-this day

 an expression of smug satisfaction passed over pens
 sharp features as she looked down upon this humble lover

 have you tired of talking to-that coralie roweton
 thing she inquired her tone still far from amiable

 gregg looked up suddenly his eyes were big with re-
 proach

 pen pen he chided how you misunderstand me
 do you know where coralie is now

 go on said the girl eagerly have you sent her away 

 gregg pointed a quivering dramatic finger at the closet
 door

 she is in there locked up and there she stays to pre-
 vent trouble-making until we are married-or until you
 tell me that all is over between you and me

 penelope elridge turned a triumphant scintillating pair

 of eyes on the door behind which coralie was supposedly
 languishing

  i care not what laws i shatter what penalties i face-
for you the pilot rushed on but his task was over pen
elridge melted rapturously into his arms murmuring en-
dearments and over her shoulder he flashed that same
ironical smile as he responded to her in loverlike language

  but dear we must be sensible he whispered after a
few moments had passed ever so gently he disengaged
himself  must give orders to my men if anything

should occur to mar our wedding- his tongue could

find no words to voice his horror but his mobile face mir-
rored it for an instant

  he strode to the front door and flung it open hance
come in all of you

 back into the living-room the three tramped jaws
dropped as in response to greggs swift gesture they stared
at pen elridge her eyes were downcast her pale checks
flooded with color before their eyes

  gregg moved swiftly toward her and his arm went about
her waist he led her gently toward the door of her room
murmuring his regret that the crude affairs of the world
must separate them once again the door closed softly
behind her and louis gregg faced his men with a com-
placent smile on his lips

  boss yer a wonder hance renewed his fealty with a
downward sweep of his hand say the word im travelin

wid you and these blokes- his eye dwelt fiercely upon

meigler and the giant-are cornin too

 very good responded gregg moving away from the
door now what weve got to do is to get word to old
roweton himself that-

 he came to a startled pause a rapid tattoo was re-
sounding from the panels of the front door an instant
later before a man could move the door was flung open
the man called cross walked unhurriedly into the room

a gathering place for those jiho fly jiho would like
to fly oit who ares interested in the fast-growing
business and sports of aviation

ow what a gang has rallied around this
month i if this keeps on well have to ask
the traffic manager to let us meet out in the
middle of the field instead of over here in the
shade of the hangar we might have ex-
pected it we whose hearts are in this flying business
know full well that the number of air-minded boys and girls
men and women is almost limitless we might have known
that they would rally around one flying field where the new-
comer has an equal voice with the old-timer where the
fledgling may speak out without fear that some pilot who has
had a couple of thousand hours in the air will say pipe
down swab let your elders speak and listen with respect 
welcome to our circle you folks who are sitting in for
the first time its a great gang the only cost of admis-
sion to full membership is the price of a postage stamp and
the energy to write us and say happy landings to the
other pilots and would-be pilots who are gathered around

  mrs e r s of newton mass certainly started a whale
of an argument in our february meeting the gang is still
arguing about it listen

    to me the most interesting article that you had in
  your february issue was the letter from mrs e r s
  in which she stressed disappointment and anger at your
  publication for advising young men to enter the avia-
  tion game she would not allozo the youngster even to
  finish reading this most interesting magazine

   thank goodness my mother zvas different she
  wanted me to fly and to take an interest in the things
  that would eventually come to the front as the airplane
  has done in the past few years

    i have had two hours instruction lately and i get
  much enjoyment out of flying when i can get my
  pilots license ill fly bach to my home town and the
  first thing ill do will be to take mother on a trip into
  the clouds and shes fifty-eight years old and would
  she fly boy howdy shes a modern american
  woman-what you might call one grand sport

               earle m holden daytona beach fla

  and heres another

    i sure would like to join the flying field and i know
  therell be no objections i like the stories in your mag-
  azine and get a real thrill out of them as i was read-
  ing the letters i happened to notice one written by a
  mrs e r s saying that the stories did nothing but
  teach young boys suicide careers i knozv differently

  your stories do nothing but tell about real adventure

  i guess i ought to know for i ant interested in flying
  and spend as much time as i can at the airport here in
  butte we have a wonderful airport here with many
  planes flying and an air-mail plane dropping in every
  day

                        lillian kemp butte mont

  welcome miss kemp you are already a member in good
standing well watch for your name some day in the
list of licensed pilots

     the letter from mrs e r s is ridiculous to say the
  least her attitude on flying as a suicide career is all
  wrong and decidedly un-american i am advising my
  son to go into aviation and doggone it i am going with
  him crazy no aviation is a thing of the future
  tell the dear lady and the future is every young mans
  right at beast in america safe do you think i
  would send my son into something without thinking
  hardly i am no pilot but i learned to take a ship up
  and bring it down without breaking my neck and ill
  say this i consider flying nowadays safer than driving
  a motor-car in this city of chicago from my rather
  short experience of barely twenty flying hours i can
  testify that any one using common sense flying good
  ships and doing with those ships what they lucre built
  to do is safe enough take flying away from our young
  men and put her suicide stamp on it and you have
  taken away the right of every young and able-bodied
  man a right which the u s a extends to those who
  can thank their stars for living in this country i come
  front germany and believe me i knozv zvhat i am
  talking about

        a c besser  diversey ave chicago iii

  shove over gang and let our new pilot-member sit down
lie is modest about his twenty hours we can remember
how we boasted when we passed our tenth wed have
taken beachy for a ride any time about the twentieth
hour we began to know something pilot bessers remarks
about common sense and using good ships for what they
were built for deserves a second reading read it again
you stunt artists 
heres a different point of view

     i ant sorry that mrs e r s takes the view she does

  it seems to me that her boy should be permitted to choose
  his own vocation but i am a mother and only too zvell




flying stories

  do i know the terror she has in her heart i too have
  a small boy aged eleven he and his dad wander off
  for hours at a time in the direction of the airport here
  when they come back i look terror-stricken for be-
  traying oil smudges on their faces i dont think sonny
  has flown yet but i dont knoiv and i dont dare ask
  you laugh at vie for being afraid

    unless youve been through what i have i dont blame
  you i was a very young war-bride married to a war
  flier as a bride i accompanied him to his various train-
  ing fields here and there throughout the country i hove
  seen slender young officers and cadets who dined with
  us the evening before tail spin to the ground and burn
  ive seen my own husband fall ive seen-but it doesnt
  matter now but i am afraid my husband is going to
  fly again after all these years and take sonny with him
  yes i know planes are better and motors are reliable
  but still im afraid now laugh at me if you wish

                                f f b tampa fla

  no mrs b there is not a smile in the entire gathering
we know only too well how the image of those early days
must be branded upon your heart we admire you for not
asking your menfolk old and young whether or not they
have been flying may all their landings be happy ones

  but let us state our own position once again for the bene-
fit of the newcomers we the editors are content merely
to publish fact and fiction about what we personally believe
to be the greatest sport and the finest business ever developed
since man first discovered that he did not need his hands to
assist him in walking we sympathize with those who do
not see flying as we do but advise others to fly no
those who feel the urge to ride the wings of the winds will
do so without our advice those who have no such desire
had best stay on the ground it is after all a perfectly rea-
sonable difference of opinion and a difference of opinion
is what enables lawyers-and magazine editors-to make
their livings

  stand out from under the propellers you men flyers and
make way for a girl who is all set to go heres what she
says

    i read your latest issue of flying stories and be-
  lieve me it reached the ceiling i like the stories that
  are rip-roaring full of action but the lovey-dovey stuff
  is a washout i think your authors are very clever and
  must have seen more or less of the world from the air
  themselves

     believe me int not waiting until i get out of school to
  fly im taking hintons home-study course and its the
  airplanes flippers

    watch out men we girls are coming right along-
 and there are a good many who are not afraid of mice
 spiders or snakes and who probably wouldnt be greatly
 worried up in a plane if the pilot suddenly got tired of
 liifing and did an outside loop

    may i ask a question in closing is it possible for a
  girl to make a business of flying  lots of girls who are
  longing to fly and have no money are hopeless because
  they think girls cant get jobs flying if not-why not

 if so-hurray many happy landings

    from a sincere sky booster

                    benita g coffin somerville mass

  thats quite a letter to tell the truth it has this editor
  at a disadvantage from the take-off we are no more timid
  than most men weve flown our share we once nose-
  dived a bomber loaded with  pounds of t n t smack
  into the ground and were able to light the traditional non-
  chalant cigarette to show that it hadnt scared us two whoops
  but well confess that we have two fears-a snakes ugh i
  and b outside loops if any one ever takes us up and puts
  us through an outside loop well spend the rest of our life

chasing him with a lewis gun

  but as to girls making a living why not  to be sure lack
of money and lack of a job are serious handicaps but not
impossible ones among our most famous girl flyers there
are several who became started under similar conditions

  miss coffin likes the thrills but not the love stories eh
well she isnt alone in that heres a letter from the top
of the pile

    for the luvva mike cut out the clinches in your
 stories give us the real he-man stuff and cut out the
 mush the bird who said that when a pilot fell in love
 his wings were soon clipped said a mouthful

                        pete miller portland maine

  as weve said before we are always open to reason if
you dont like love stories among those of action and adven-
ture in the air we wont publish them vote on it you
folks out there let us know what you want and well give
it to you so far this love versus no-love argument is al-
most a draw here for instance is another opinion

     just how any one can say that girls havent any serious
  part in an aviators life is more than i can see hasnt
  woman always played an interesting part in mans life
  since the time of adam and eve was she not put here
  to be mans companion are aviators the exceptions
  to the rule

    as for your correspondent saying that he would sell
  his plan-e to buy the wedding ring when he got married
  just think liow many joy-rides they might have together
  if he kept the plane and bought the ring too would
  this not take the monotony out of life and furnish a few
  thrills instead just use your imagination

                          beatriz gillogly oakland calif

  and heres another

    the adding of a few flying love stories to your table
  of contents is just the thing that makes flying stories
  such a welcome relief from all the other air magazines
  that flood the stands it gives balance and variety to
  your fiction-something absolutely necessary if an in-
  telligent reader wishes to read your book from cover to
  cover all love stories decidedly not all war and
  adventure thumbs down keep on as youve taken
  off the field and your flight will be a long one ill buy
  you a gallon of gas or two every month

                      sam helmuth nogales aris

  so there you are speak up the rest of you this book
  is yours it you dont like it well change it

  next month we plan to start calling the roll of those who
  have done their bit to make flying safer for their brother
  and sister pilots by helping in the great movement to place
  air-markers in every city town and hamlet in the united
  states

  in some of the larger cities the placing of a proper air-
  marker is a big task in others it calls for only a few
  minutes work with a paint brush and a stepladder plus a
  large roof surface and strangely enough it is in the small
  towns where the work is easiest that it is the most neces-
  sary flyers arent likely to mistake new york chicago san
  francisco or other great cities for any other town but
  from the air every little town looks pretty much like every
  other little town it is entirely conceivable that your five
  minutes with a paint brush atop your movie theater or your
  largest garage may some day save a fog-bewildered airman
  who must find a suitable place to land his ship isnt it
  worth while lets hear from all of you who are doing
  your bit if youve asked your club to exert its influence
the flying field



if youve talked to the mayor or the chamber of commerce
if youve written a letter to your local newspaper let us
know we pilots will all be grateful

  heres an interesting letter and one which brings out a
reasonable point of view as well as a flood of old memories

    i wonder why so many of your authors use baron von
  richthofen as the hero of their storiest surely he was
  no greater flyer and fighter than many of the members
  of his circus why not for a change make some of the
  great french aces your heroesf nungesser for in-
  stance why not have a series of articles telling about
  the exploits of some of these wonderful allied acesf
  hows this for a suggestion-why not have a reunion
  in the flying fiekl of the old timers of the r f c
  and the lafayette escadrule

                                p j f new york

  as to the suggestion about publishing a series of articles
about the meteoric careers of some of the noted aces well
leave that to you around the circle here would you like
them or not  let us know

  we subscribe most heartily to the reunion suggestion al-
though we frankly doubt whether there will be a very large
gathering of old pilots of the r f c and the lafayette
escadrille there arent many left you know of the real
old-timers of both outfits

  we didnt know so many of the r f c boys personally
although we bumped into them here and there along the
front and dropped in on their airdromes once in a while we
had some noble battles widi and against some of diem in
the streets of paris in the wee sma hours of the morning
we remember them with joy those were the days

  but the lafayette escadrille-there the names become
personalities bill thaw norman price victor chapman
elliot cowdin bert hall clyde balsley walter lovell
harold willis dave lewis-were recalling a few names
and a few faces from memory some of them who have an-
swered the last roll-call of all what a crew i we wonder
where the survivors are now now and then we run across
one of them and over a litde table remember this pilot and
that one some of them though seldom heard of are among
the greatest heroes of all times to our way of thinking

there was clyde balsley for instance we dont know
how many planes he had to his credit if any but what
a youngster he was a little fellow perhaps five feet six he
was one of the very first of the little group to form what
was dien called the franco-american flying corps on one
of his first trips over die lines he received an explosive
bullet in the stomach for a year or more he lay in the
american ambulance hospital in neuilly undergoing one
operation after another wc who had known him when
he drove an american ambulance thought he had died we
returned to paris early in  and heard that he lived
after a fashion we called the hospital he was being dis-
charged that day we met at henris over a table he told
us that he was leaving die following day for the front as a
machine-gunner he could no longer pilot of course-he
was almost a hopeless cripple but he could point a machine-
gun so the french had at last permitted him to do so
courage of a kind seldom encountered in our experience

  we met him once more quite by accident in washing-
ton just before the armistice we noticed a familiar looking
little figure hobbling down th street he wore the uni-
form of an american captain reminded of some one we
looked again and there was balsley the marks of suffering
indelibly etched on his face but the indomitable courage
still flashing in his eyes the american army was making
use of his knowledge and experience but he regretted being

	miles from the combat

  again we lost track of him and have heard nothing from
him since we wonder where he is we wonder where the

rest of his kind are now many of diem we know have
stopped flying some of them have not bill thaw now
col william thaw acquired a few broken bones when his
plane crashed a few months ago in a transcontinental air
race

  if any of the old-timers british or american read these
words wont they answer present to the roll-call  therell
be big comfortable seats for them at this and at all other
gatherings of air-minded folk

three or four years ago miss rosalie klausner of 
west rd street new york city enjoyed a trip to
europe with her father who is a prosperous florist as is
not uncommon she kept a diary faithfully too a few
bits from it jotted down as she was flying across the eng-
lish channel struck us as mighty interesting it made us
feel as if we were really along with her

    i am writing this while passing over england above
  the clouds father and i and five other persons besides
  the pilot and mechanic are in this huge airplane-not to
  mention hundreds of pounds of baggage we left lon-
  don at four oclock

    the scenes below are positively indescribable we
  started up slowly and we are nmv passing over fleecy
  white clouds it is without the slightest doubt the su-
  preme thrill

    i am thoroughly enjoying the sensation-so is father
  hes not a bad sport

    the trees and houses below are almost indistinguish-
  able they are so minute

    we are in wireless communication with other air-
  planes and with the airdrome in croydon

    we have fust reached the english channel its get-
  ting much colder now i was wise to bring my sweater
  along

    i am thinking of my mother atul how much she would
  not enjoy knowing about this ufnvard flight of ours

     father is so entirely unsentimental that he is sitting
  here partaking of such earthly things as gooseberries
  and grapes a basket of which we brought along with us
  from joe shearn in london i do believe that hell take
  a ham-and-egg sandwich and probably some matza-
  pens when he knocks on the door for st peter

    we are now approaching the coast of france we
  made the channel in one half hour i can see the coast-
  line but i cannot see any houses or trees on the land
  the clouds obstruct our view

    there is not the slightest uncomfortable sensation
  the feeling is that of suspension-an aerated sensation

  if it were not for the fact that i hear the noise of the pro-
  pellers i would not be sure that i am in a state of con-
  sciousness

    we are nmv flying above paris-plage i believe i see
  a multitude of forts or barracks or some kind of mili-
  tary buildings along the coast it is only five-fifteen
  now its certainly wonderftd to be able to be in croy-
  don london england at four oclock and in paris-
  plage by five-fifteen what progress the world is mak-
  ing

    we just passed another plane on the next street
  you see ours is a one way street there are landing
  stations every fifteen miles on land

    we are passing over ameins and beauvais france
  is a very pretty and well-kept country

    we are flying lower now in order to make the landing
  a gradual one there is the airdrome were landing
  now- oclock round and round in a circle-then
  terra firma

  well its been a good meeting hasnt it but its getting
late the long shadows are crawling across the field the
flying cone is coming down see you all next month

  until then cheerio  happy landings

l c o u u n t

tk is pilots dreaded the ait until
the big moment camej

the big crowd which came out to robins field every
sunday afternoon to watch the flying of the one
hundred and sixth observation squadron state na-
tional guard surged against the fence it stood on
tiptoe and climbed on running boards and automo-
bile tops with hundreds of eyes focused on one point of the
field members of the squadron waiting to fly or tending
ships cautioned each other to stand back

  out on the field just past the hangars where ships came
in and took off a man lay on the ground beside a plane
two other men stood nearby and the flight surgeon was
kneeling beside the prostrate figure what was the mat-
ter  came the collective query the plane was intact had
he been hit by the propeller  every one asked apparently
not had he fallen out of the plane no he had been
dragged out of the plane

  it became apparent that members of the squadron were
snickering and telling each other something very funny
presently the man on the ground opened his eyes and was
half helped half dragged into a hangar several squadron
members following him with broad grins and allegedly witty
remarks one forlorn searching glance at the crowd was
the only sign of interest he exhibited the center of the little
scene was private jones and private jones was very ill

  a few moments before the plane in which he had been a
passenger had gone through a series of stunts which was
part of the squadrons regular practice but jones who had
accepted an opportunity rare with him for a flight while hid-
ing the fact that he had been upset since morning from
something he ate at breakfast had lost the battle with his
stomach

  this was very unfortunate for private jones because of
all men in the squadron it would cost him most in painful
jibes and he knew that the plea that he had already been
ill would only aggravate matters

  some one had once called jones the helmet and goggle
brigade because jones connection with flying was it is
feared chiefly in the fact that he wore helmet and goggles
on almost any and some said all occasions at least he wore
them well the more romantic spirit of aviation was never
without its representative when jones was present

  the old-time mechanics highly trained experts who made
their living keeping the squadrons planes in shape and other
members of the national guard outfit took great delight in
jones the ground flyer and although it was this very
kidding that reduced jones opportunities for flying the spirit
of the kidding gradually became confused with the idea that
jones was a little bit afraid of flying or perhaps altogether
afraid

  so when jones became ill it was practically taken for
granted that he had became ill because he had been scared
the whole result was that jones was almost completely
cheated of the flying instruction most enlisted men were
given just as a favor by the pilots

  one situation aggravated another those who rode
jones couldnt know that he sat all day long on his stool at
the offices of the hardware house where he was bookkeeper
and dreamed about flying flying was in his brain in his
muscles his fingers and in his very soul he lived it ate it
and slept it and when he had enlisted in the squadron two
years before he had at once purchased helmet and goggles

and some of the men swore he had never taken them off since

  so when he strode along the edge of the field with his hel-
met and goggles and his serious romantic air thrilling at the
glances from the crowd outside the fence the squadron
members had yelled helmet and goggle brigade at him

  thus he didnt get so much flying as he might have but the
urge was still in his soul and so it made him strut more and
wear his helmet and goggles more and talk bigger

  the more he posed the less he flew and the less he flew the
more he posed

  jones lay in the hangar slowly recovering and wondering
if she had seen his humiliation the glance over his
shoulder as they were dragging him in showed that she was
not standing where he had seen her just before he went up
he prayed she had gone every sunday the regular drill
day of the squadron and some other days too he had seen
her there at the fence and longed to know her-and dreaded
it

  he knew she had been watching him knew he had
knocked her cold but he was afraid his bubble would
burst if she met him and thus came in contact with other
members of the squadron who would of course generously
supply her with details about his flying

  he thought too lying there about the endless kidding he
was in for because he had become ill while flying it would
get old old old-that kidding theyd drive him mad hed
quit if they didnt let up hed quit next month hed give
them one month and then good-by to his dreams

  but a week or so later jones illness jones and in fact
practically every other individual member of the squadron
was forgotten in the excitement over reports from the state
capital for it appeared the squadron was facing the pos-
sibility of an amputation or even complete annihilation

anew governor had been elected and the new governor
had appointed a new adjutant-general the new ad-
jutant who is head of the national guard was expected to
show washington in a fact-and-figure report that each unit
of the national guard would be cared for under the new
administration equally as well as it was under the old

  any unit especially one as expensive as the squadron
which the adjutant-general mentioned negligently or which
he neglected to mention at all was likely to suffer in wash-
ington it appeared that in the squadrons case the whole
outfit might be eliminated

  it further appeared that present indications were the ad-
jutant-general wouldnt give the squadron much attention
the new head of the state military it seemed being an old-
time politician and an older-time military man had as old-
time military men arc often accused little interest in aviation
to him it was feared that branch of the service when he
thought of it at all still appeared as a fanciful experiment

  major walters the squadrons commanding officer inter-
viewed the governor and he interviewed the adjutant-general
these gentlemen were polite but their minds were elsewhere
so soon after election

  so the members of the squadron worried and cussed and
hoped desperately while the shears that were to clip her
wings snapped closer and closer

  it was a pleasant saturday morning in the private office
of his excellency thomas i murphy governor of the state


fly-but

the governor was at ease with his feet upon his desk and his
friend mr joe mcallister recently appointed assistant chief
something-or-other at such and such a salary reclined across
another corner of the official furniture

  joe you know what inquired his excellency rhetori-
cally

  what prompted mr mcallister

  ive got to attend that dinner of the state improvement
league in steelville tonight

  yeah its hell to have to take a trip all the way up there
to listen to a lot of hot air from that bunch of high hats
sympathized joe

  hell nothing replied his excellency taking his feet off
the desk and leaning toward mr mcallister thats not the
hell the trip i mean you may not realize it but that bunch
is getting stronger and stronger and they can make a lot of
trouble or be a big help you know what one of the biggest
planks in my platform was dont you  a plank i inserted es-
pecially for the benefit of that crowd 

  youve doubtless heard that there has been a controversy
over the proposed new north-and-south highway that lasted
through the whole four years of the last administration
well i promised that id personally see to it that a satis-
factory contract for that highway was signed within three
weeks after inauguration its been a month now and ive
got an idea tonights kind invitation is a call to the carpet

  mr mcallister brightened alec smith is in johnsonville
with the contractors now isnt he  he asked

  yes hes there and hell have the contract all signed up
by two oclock this afternoon jf the contract had only the
ninety miles to travel from here to steelville where the sup-
per is to be tonight that i have everything would be easy
but johnsonville is three hundred miles away from steel-

ville and there is no way in hell or on earth to get that con-
tract there in time for the dinner tonight

  well what of it you can tell them alout it or you
can even read a telegram from alec and polish things off in
grand style

  the governor looked harried

  say you dont know that bunch theyve fought battled
bickered quarreled and pulled hair over that highway for
four years and the news that its been settled is going to be
big news to them

  and the man who gets credit for putting it over is going
to be solid with them for life well i mean to get credit for
it and i want that little old contract right there in my hand
to wave over their heads when i make the announcement
his excellency became enthusiastic he pulled himself
closer to mr mcallister and his eyes shone

ahy joe itll be the greatest tiling yet ill sit there
  all quiet and everything until im introduced then
ill stand up with that little old contract right there in my
pocket and ill tell them

   gentlemen ill say gentlemen you are probably in-
terested in our new north-and-south highway more than in
anything else there has been a great deal of controversy-
needless i am convinced-and you have been given various
excuses why the matter was not settled all that was needed
was for the man at the head of our state government to get
behind it and put it through i told you that if i were elected
i would do so and gentlemen i am a man of my word i
have put through a contract for the new highway

  ill pause there joe and let that sink in then ill pull
out the contract and wave it over their heads

   gentlemen ill say here is the contract that will give




flying stories

our great state one of the greatest highways in this great
nation ilis excellency gradually wilted in his chair and
stared gloomily at the inkwell

  at least thats what i would say if i could get the con-
tract for tonight you know joe it looks like a little thing
but it wont be the same unless ive actually got the contract
in hand i lose the punch out of one of my best bets
yeah it wont be the same sympathized joe who was
often annoyed at the governors insistence on what joe con-
sidered petty details in the elaborate stagings the new execu-
tive prepared for his speeches but after all he was king

  why dont you pull a dummy contract on them asked
joe	

  and have the whole bunch crowding around to read terms
weve lined up and me with a blank contract in my hands
no sir thats too much risk

  they pondered a while hopelessly

  say said joe suddenly why couldnt you get alec to
start the contract out in a fast car as soon as its signed he
might make it

  the hope that had arisen in his excellencys face faded
and died

rong again if we already had the new highway
we might have a chance just a bare chance but
the way things are now there wouldnt be the faintest hope
of an auto making the trip in five hours even if the schedule
carried through perfectly

  if you only had an airplane mused mr mcallister

  the governor sat upright

  say theres a thought yes sir joe thats a brilliant
thought

  look here i believe the state has a national guard flying
outfit of some sort hasnt it

  yeah i believe it has yeah im sure of it i saw some
of them flying around here inauguration day

  his excellency was all business now

  all right lets get right in behind this lets start right
now ive got to catch a train at one-thirty look in the
adjutant-generals oflice joe the second on the left down die
corridor and see if colonel marks is in there tell him to
hop right up here

  presently joe reappeared in company with the states new
adjutant-general

  whats up tom he greeted the governor your first
mine war 

  no no sit down pete listen i want you to do me
a little favor

  all right

  hasnt the national guard got a flying outfit

  yes weve got some sort of organization at robins field
in steelville

  well say now pete theres a certain little contract that
has got to be waved in the air while i make a little speech
in steelville tonight but right now that contract is in
johnsonville and it wont be ready until two oclock

  the only chance in the world of getting it is to get one
of those planes to make a round trip to johnsonville in time
to get it and be in steelville by seven oclock or before dark
some time

  well said colonel marks ill call up the squadrons
commanding officer and see what he can do goodness knows
they ought to be good for something i dont know what else
theyve done

  colonel marks retired to his own office his excellency
had become very much impressed with the little show he was
going to put on for the state improvement league and so
when colonel marks returned half an hour later he found the
governor staring nervously out of the window and busying
himself with breaking up a pencil while mr mcallister paced
the floor for him

  his excellency whirled around when the adjutant-general
entered

  what did he say pete can they do it

  yep the commanding officer said he would make the trip
himself theyll bring the contract to your hotel before die
dinner

  the governor relaxed

  well now thats fine thats just fine
  

  bookkeeper jones looked at the head bookkeepers retreat-
ing back with lifelong gratitude it appeared diat the work
was pretty well caught up and so as was the office custom
jones was to have the rest of saturday morning and all of
saturday afternoon off

  bookkeeper jones would now become private jones of the
hundred and sixth observation squadron he reached in
a desk drawer and found his helmet and goggles sunday
afternoon was drill period and the whole squadron was al-
ways at the field to fly but on saturdays there would be
several pilots out and only a few men

  maybe he would get a hop for a change

  at the field a few minutes later jones went to the locker
room dressed himself in his light flying suit and fitted his
helmet and goggles carefully on his head he had noticed a
number of sightseers already hanging on the fence and he
wanted to be in the midst of the glory of flying outside
he thought of an errand that would take him up the field
close to the fence

  adjusting his eyes to a shade proper to one intent on dar-
ing he strode along catching the sightseers in the corner of
his eye to see if they were getting the effect and-joy of
joys-he saw her

  two young ladies in their late teens hung on the fence
close together both were ornaments to the fence their
clothes were neat colorful and brief

  either the brown eyes or the blue were a good choice but
at the moment the blue eyes were all aglow their possessor
nudged her companion excitedly

  there he conies sadie there there

  where june asked the brown eyes

  there right there with all the swell flying things on
june martin of ladies and misses ready-to-wear de-
partment jupiter ginsbergs big store clutched her com-
panions arm as private jones strode by

  then she clasped her hands in abandoned ecstasy

  oh aint he cute aint he cnte aint he the cutest
thing into these cutes blue-eyed june put all her heart
and they carried what might have been expressed by one
more academic with handsome romantic thrilling charm-
ing and devastatingly gallant

  sadies eyes followed private jones and she was im-
pressed

veah yeah he is cute she admitted do you come
out here every saturday and sunday to see him
june wouldnt admit to much abandonment

  well  come out nearly every sunday ive been out the
last six sundays and sometimes saturday but not just to see
him shucks i like to watch the flying besides i told you
i have never met him he dont know me from adams off
ox gosh i bet hes some pilot

  sadie halted a reply to stare after him

  well say junie why dont you get somebody to intro-
duce you to him

  gosh wouldnt i love to ive tried and tried but i
dont know anybody that knows him

  she looked about eagerly for some one who might know
jones her eyes lighted on corporal jim sprague leaning
against the opposite side of the fence

  who is that man right there  the tall one with the hel-
met and goggles she asked jim excitedly

  jim looked her over carefully then inspected jones and
chuckled

  oh hes a member of the helmet and goggle brigade
  junes eyes grew big is he a good pilot 
a flyer who couldnt fly - but



 jim turned around to give her the full benefit of the re-
 marks he was about to make

 him  why hes-

 a yell from out on the field interrupted

 hey jim some one called its your hop

 june turned to sadie

 see sadie she said excitedly hes a member of the
 helmet and goggle brigade and i was going to get that boy
 to introduce me yes i was im going to find him again

 on his return trip down the field jones eyes resumed their
 impersonal trailing over the crowd but for a moment they
 focused definitely-on the blue eyes

 thhey made him slightly dizzy even if this was about the
 fortieth time he had looked at them he wanted des-
 perately to run over and pick up one of those quick acquaint-
 ances but he couldnt do it that way with her

 anyway he couldnt meet her at all he suddenly realized
 because some squadron wit would be sure to stop and ask
 him if he was feeling all right lately

 the squadron elected its officers from the ranks if he
 only had a chance jones thought but hed always be a
 private

 he noticed that the girl was talking to jim sprague and

 the falcon out on the line the crew began filling tha
 tanks with gasoline

 falcon is the name of uncle sams latest type observation
 plane it is one of the largest planes carrying two men
 pilot and observer the pilot rides in the front cockpit and
 the observer in the rear

 sergeant bill inspected the planes oil

 who wants to go with major walters he asked

 none of the privates dared speak until the full-time me-
 chanics all staff or master sergeants expressed themselves
 however these old-timers seldom sought a hop and none
 wanted to go this trip

 like a sudden whirl of the wind before the others could
 speak one private stood before sergeant bill

 let me go he said

 bill surveyed private jones with a show of disapproval

 you dont deserve to go he said severely the way you
 are always kicking even after vou do most of the flving

 well but i-

 oh go ahead the squadrons going to hell anyway

 whoopee yelled blackie harrison a little weather
 hardened mechanic who had nursed air steeds for war birds
 in france whoopee the helmet and goggle brigade is
 going up better give him a pill and some nice snug wrist

 all of jones world resolved into	stick ke clutched in both

 his hands everything else was jorgottens nothing else ever existed
 an d the engine continued to roaip wide openj

 just thatj stick pull ifc back and tke skip would level off
 pull ifcj back and jix things up

 he pulled the stick refused to budge he pulled wi th all the
 strength of legs and arms until it seemed jus temples would bursts

half hoped half feared jim might call to him the outside
gong on the telephone clanged noisily and jones welcomed
the chance to rush to it

  but master sergeant bill martin foreman of the me-
chanics perched atop a liberty motor had heard the phone
first bill cussing climbed down and answered it

  hello

  this is major walters bill the governor has an offi-
cial paper in johnsonville which lie wants brought here this
afternoon can you have one of the falcons ready to go
by eleven-thirty

  yes sir replied bill

  im going to fiy it myself and say i dont want to cause
any false hopes or to appear foolishly excited but this looks
like our chance its the first time theyve paid us any at-
tention at all and when we bring this paper back it will prob-
ably get some action in our favor at least it will give us
something to work on and at any rate well certainly ruin
all our chances if we dont get it back

  all right sir well service a ship right away and have
it ready for you

  come on somebody bill shouted back into the hangar
lets get this falcon out major walters is going to john-
sonville

  when the others gathered around the big plane he ex-
plained to them that the sun in all probability was about
to rise and dispel all their troubles

  eagerly the other mechanics aided by jones and a few
other enlisted men who had been loafing at the field pushed

warmers and bill you better go with him to keep him
from getting nervous

  jones was silent he had been expecting something like
this from somebody and blackie seemed to have it in for
him worst of all hed tell blackie a few when he got back

  private jones pressed his fingers on his helmet over his
cars as major walters opened the throttle in the last stage
of warming up the engine this would be jones first hop
in one of the squadrons falcons heretofore his flying
such as it had been had been confined to training ships

  he was a little dismayed by the terrific blast of air hurled
back by the powerful libertys propeller he could hardly
stick his head above the cockpit without having his goggles
almost ripped from his head hed get used to it though he
supposed

hp he windshield was a narrow strip of material similar
to celluloid or mica and served as a windshield only when
one kept his head firmly behind it to add to jones dis-
comfort his windshield had a large gaping crack across the
bottom where it had been broken loose

  some awkward wrench slinger had set himself upon it
and snapped loose several of the rivets which fastened it to
its frame and thence to the rim of the cockpit it was a
wonder jones told himself in annoyance that some of these
fellows didnt fall through the wings every time they got near
a ship

  it might be dangerous if that thing came loose while they
were flying he comforted himself by inspecting it closely


f lying stories

and discovering that most of the rivets were still holding the
sheet of mica firmly too firmly for any wind to rip it loose

  in the air the big plane roared away climbing climbing
climbing at two thousand feet the major leveled off in the
direction of johnsonville jones stood up in the deep ob-
servers cockpit to look around the terrific wind pressed
against his nose and closed his nostrils took his breath and
whipped his goggles cross-wise on his face

  he sat down to adjust his goggles hed have to get used
to these falcons they were certainly a different proposi-
tion he imagined himself flying the falcon reached out and
touched the control stick before him which moved gently as
the major moved his own in the other cockpit he touched
his feet gently on the rudder pedals

  no-he couldnt quite see himself flying this monster he
admitted it was so different from the lighter training ships
one dared hardly look over the cockpits rim the big wings
hid so much of the view and when the big plane wobbled or
hit an air bump it was with so much greater force than in
the slower planes to which jones was accustomed

trivate jones had often imagined himself the hero
in an accident wherein the pilot should become disabled
and jones should bring the plane safely to ground although
he had never actually hoped that this would occur there
was a great deal more fervor in his hope that it would not
now because he felt that he would certainly be helpless in
this roaring air dragon

  the field at johnsonville had never before seen a falcon
and private jones basked in the glory of his almost contemp-
tuous familiarity with it and answered questions for the
curious while major walters sought a telephone to inquire
about the paper which had not been brought to the field as
expected

  in a few minutes major walters returned to the ship
mumbling remarks too livid to be delivered aloud the
paper it seemed had not been signed or something the
person to whom the major had talked said he would have it
at the field in an hour-he hoped

  a stiff and rising breeze which had sprung up from the
direction of steelville failed to cool the majors ire in
fact it seemed to fan the flames higher and when the major
noticed low gray clouds scuttling up out of the south fol-
lowed by blacker ones down on the horizon the livid remarks
heretofore mumbled were announced loudly and in a clear
voice for instruction of all who might wish to listen

  the clouds promised certain rain there was no escap-
ing it the head wind would delay them greatly and if they
were delayed until darkness caught them in the rain disaster
would be ilmost certain well if it got too late he just
wouldnt try it and that was all there was to it the major
decided with colorful comments diercon just the luck to
be expected though

  just when the opportunity arrived to attract a little fa-
vorable attention from officialdom it seemed it would be
turned into unfavorable attention while the former did not
necessa ilv mean that the squadron would be saved the latter
almost certainly meant its doom

  an hour passed and in spite of the fact that the major
had not expected the paper in the hour promised he renewed
his torrid comments with new and original trimmings just
as the fifth minute of the next five elapsed a taxi hurtled a
few ditches on the edge of the field and crashed to a stop in
front of the hangar

  the major took one look at the man climbing out of it
clutching a heavy manila envelope and shouted to the me-
chanics on hand to start his motor

  private jones waited for no instructions he climbed hur-
riedly into the cockpit adjusted his goggles and fastened his
safety belt the major climbcd in in front of him halting
long enough to shout that he thought they could make it all
right

  they were off

  jones looked above him at the sky now completely over-

cast and sending tentative warnings drops of water to earth
the clouds shut off the sun almost completely and made the
time appear much later than it was above the roar of the
engine jones sensed an ominous hush

  soon the drops increased in frequency and a few moments
later they were cutting across his face like red-hot needles
and in such quantity that the nose of the big ship was only
barely visible

  private jones was uneasy became much more uneasy and
then finally gave himself over to wishing fervently that he
had never come on this mission he trusted the majors
flying implicitly but now they were skimming along at an
altitude of one hundred and fifty feet and die strong head-
wind reduced die ships ground speed alarmingly while the
bumps met at the low altitude tossed the plane angrily

  jones sincerely hoped that the long-imagined incident
should not occur and that the major would be in command
of every faculty including several spares the very thought
made him panicky of course nothing could happen to the
major on his own account but what he thought if some
one had left a wrench or something on top of the center
section and this should fall off on the majors head he
craned his neck to see that the center section was clear

  or what he thought if something should tear loose in
the engine and strike the major

  after what seemed to jones hours his misery which at
times had entered the stages of terror gradually began to
abnte and he began attempts to survey the landscape in
order to establish their location lie knew that even with
the head-winds they must be nearly home

  the ceiling by this time had lifted to about  feet in
spite of the fact that the rain seemed to have increased its
intensity and the heavens to have become darker

  jones abandoned attempts to look over the side of the cock-
pit when the terrific blast from the propeller now heavily
rain laden threatened to tear the skin from his cheeks the
great plane roared on and jones could not conceive of any
one being able to fly it with the nose and wing-tips well nigh
invisible

  he examined the windshield in front of him again for lack
of anything else to do he took off his goggles and wiped the
rain away thus he was reminded of something which the
rain had obscured the broken windshield a thought
struck him almost physically

  instantly he decided to brave the tearing wind and rain for
a moment to raise his head and look at the majors windshield

  to his horror what he had feared was true-but worse
the same lazy oil-squirter who had sat upon the windshield
in jones cockpit had repeated his show of lack of intelli-
gence in the strip of mica on the forward cockpit but it
being smaller had suffered more almost the entire line of
rivets had been torn away only one on each end remaining
and the sheet of mica was snapping about in the angry blasts
the rain and tearing wind existed for jones no more

tlte tore loose the buckle on his safety belt and stood up-
right he reached over and touched the major on his
shoulder to warn him

  the pilot shook his head violently and jones tumbled back
into his seat licking his lips feverishly the major was too
busy flying the ship to look around perhaps he had noticed
the damaged windshield already and would curse jones for
a fool when he found out what he wanted

  jones bit his knuckles in agony and glanced at the pilots
windshield it seemed that those two lonely rivets could not
possibly endure that wind except through a miracle

  he jerked his safety belt loose once more perhaps the
major would curse him for a fool on the other hand they
might both be killed if he kept silent the majors head was
directly behind the mica he pulled himself to his feet and
reached for the majors shoulder

  suddenly the broken windshield ceased snapping about
it bent low horizontal to the wind it trembled a little and
snapped off
a flyer who couldnt fly - but



  the heavy mica struck the major edgewise just above his
goggles he pitched forward against the stick then against
the cockpits side and lay still

  the great ship with a shudder engine full on tore nose
downward in an almost perpendicular dive

  jones fell back into his seat dazed with terror for a
moment his eyes refused to see and his arms refused to move

  something reminded him to get the ship on a level just
pull back on his stick half consciously he put his feet on
the rudder pedals grasped the stick and braced himself the
plane trembled all over as its speed passed the two-hundrcd-
miles-per-hour mark

  all of jones world resolved into that stick he clutched in
both his hands everything else was forgotten nothing else
ever existed and the engine continued to roar wide open

  just that stick pull it back and the ship would level off
pull it back and fix things up

  he pulled the stick refused to budge he pulled with all
the strength of legs and arms until it seemed his temples
would burst

hp hat damned motor how could a man pull a ship out
- of a dive with the motor dragging it down faster and
faster the throttle jonesleft hand released die stick for
one panicky moment and shut off the throttle in that split
second he remembered he had been told that in a dive it was
the motor that was most likely to help him out

  he shoved the throttle wide open again then back to
the stick the terror caused by the lost time brought re-
newed strength in the pull another fiber straining pull

  she answered a little more pull and gradually the big
plane leveled off the terrific force of flattening out pushed
jones low in his seat he scrambled up

  dont let her stall

  give her the gun his hand shot out to the throttle again
and pushed it timidly and then he realized it was already wide
open so concentrated had he been on the business of getting
the plane out of that horrible dive that he had hardly even
heard the engine

  jones senses cleared somewhat and with temporary re-
lief from the first horrible moment reaction seized him his
hand trembled on the throttle so that lie removed it for fear
of closing it

  his other hand shook so that he had to cling to the stick
with desperate strength his knees shook violently as he
braced his feet harder against the rudder pedals

  although jones had no account of how long the plane had
dived at that terrific speed it had in reality descended only
about seven hundred feet so that he still had a good five hun-
dred feet altitude but the ground looked too close and this
added to his terror as his recovering senses brought to him
again the ferocious wind and rain

  he was flying level at any rate but he realized that the
ship was capable of flying thus alone for a short time but
that any moment it might demand action on his part he
clung to the controls desperately and licked his feverish lips

  finally he decided to force the issue and ventured to gain
altitude his piloting experience was vague and he had no
idea how steep the ship would climb as a result he put the
nose up too much and presently was forced to realize that
the plane was threatening to stall

 this terrified him so that he forced the nose
too low and lost most of the altitude he had gained pres-
ently however he succeeded in striking an angle suitable for
a straight slow climb and settled back to wait for twelve
hundred feet before he permitted himself even to think

  at twelve hundred feet he came to the realization that he
hadnt the remotest idea in what direction he was headed
he looked overside and was overjoyed to find in the dim
mist below him a low ridge dotted with houses which he
recognized as being on the edge of steelville

  after fqrther inspection he discovered that he wa fly-
ing rapidly away from the field back in the direction of
johnsonville during this inspection he permitted the planes

nose to get too high again almost stalled whipped around
in a terrifying bank

  he snapped the plane upright with the ailerons neglecting
to adjust his rudder and skidding badly the fuselage vibrat-
ing uneasily in the heavy side wind

  he pushed the rudder too far the other way then too far
back presently however he brought the ship to a fair de-
gree of steadiness he now discovered that he was headed
lengthwise of the ridge but still away from the field he
made a wide and cautious bank and headed in what he judged
was the direction of the field

  now a new and it seemed the most terrifying problem of
all faced him he would be over the field shortly and would
have to land possibly the most difficult part of all flying for
a student jones had had no instruction whatever in land-
ing had never so much as touched die controls during a land-
ing

  worse he knew that even the most experienced pilots at
robins field who never before had flown a falcon were
given lengthy and careful instructions in landing before be-
ing permitted to take up one of die big ships

  besides that it was almost dark and although he had be-
come more accustomed to the propellers terrific wind and
slightly less terrified by the rain it still seemed impossible
for him to fly the plane very successfully for long

  his goggles had become hopelessly fogged and he tore
them from his head and cast them aside he strained his
eyes to look through the rain over the ships nose very
soon he saw two familiar smokestacks which rose from a
furnace a few hundred yards from the edge of the field

  agonizing fear held him it was small comfort that the
downpour was now only a light rain it had grown darker
and he had noticed no slackening in the rain

  his knees began to tremble again death real death not
a character in an imagined incident stared at him from be-
tween the flashes of the whirling propeller

  he couldnt make it he couldnt make it what a
simple ass he used to be away back in those times when he
was on the ground or safe on his stool at the office

  suddenly his left hand groped in front of his left shoulder
and clutched a hard metal ring the ring to the rip cord on
his parachute thank god dear old parachute he had
forgotten completely that wonderful saver of lives required
of all army flyers hed get to windward of the field jump
out and let the damn ship fly to hell

  ordinarily he would have laughed at any one who sug-
gested he make a parachute jump but now the idea was
greedily welcome with the terrors of landing the plane be-
fore him land loo low and nose into the ground at seventy-
five or eighty miles an hour or stall in a bank spin and
crash

t et the ship go to hell-and the major immediately it
was to jones as if he had no parachute he wouldnt
dare to let go the controls to attempt pulling the major
out and releasing his parachute it never occurred to him to
let the major go down with the ship alone and unconscious

  well hed have to land he was over the field now

  he was afraid to spiral down that in his inexperience he
would throw the plane into a spin so he made another cau-
tious turn and went away from the field about a mile and a
half to glide in but when he began the glide he discovered
he could not see the field was almost certain to miss it

  well hed have to go back to the field spiral in and let
her spin if she must over the field he began to spiral down
fearing a stall the chief cause of the deadly spin he spi-
ralled with his throttle partly open this brought him down
at high speed and when he was low enough to land he was
traveling much too fast

  he banked around carefully frightened by the low alti-
titude flew away from the field a short distance banked
again and started back to land miscalculating the planes
gliding ability lie kept the dirottle open too long and at the
last moment discovered he was too continued on page

from ocoa bay came in and tex could
climb out of the vacuum

  ten thousand all sorts of gliding
radius and we were slamming back
for the capital city

  sis  remarked to that kid sister
of mine my advice to you is that if
you decide to take one of these gaze-
bos take either one of them ones a
fool on wheels the other is a tailors
dummy  

  then  fainted too much excite-
ment close to the ground too much
rarefied atmosphere in the upper atr-
lanes and i had lost seventy pounds

i came to with my head in sis
lap and she was talking which
wasnt anything unusual

  ill have to find some other way
she wailed i cant marry both of
them and i cant decide which one
i want as a brother youre a darned
good wet blanket the worlds most
proficient as a matter of fact

  well t said you know your
own business best but t wondered
how she was going to decide

  i kept on wondering as the weeks
passed

  sis was very quiet and thoughtful

  every day two planes flew over our
house one invariably touched
wheels to our roof the other was in-
variably so high he couldnt have
picked out anything but the approxi-
mate location of our domicile sis
thought tex was something of a
fraid cat and that shep was too reck-
less such recklessness being conducive
to early widowhood on the part of
whoever married shep on the other
hand tex might somehow climb so
high some day he wouldnt be able to
find his way back down

 then i got up one morning and
called sis she didnt answer i
waited for half an hour called her
again

  yep there was the usual letter on
the bureau

  have gone into the cordilleras
somewhere between manoguayabo
and san jose de ocoa to wrestle with
my soul if i have one and decide
which of those two chaps i want i
cant have em both cluttering up our
front porch forever

  well theres a lot of territory be-
tween manoguayabo and san jose de
ocoa and its all jungle except what
is mountain peaks and i had a hunch
sis could take care of herself she
was my sister see

  but then i was worried too the
hinterland was no place for a young
white girl to be in the gentlemen of
the interior liked white girls if one
were to judge by the way they eyed
those they were privileged to gaze
upon besides that the jungle was full
of gavilleros those malcontents who
saw off the muzzles of shotguns and

flying suitors

continued from page 

rifles and go to the hills to rob and
waylay the fact that our one and
only maid was missing too didnt help
me any im a bum cook

   but as i said theres lots of terri-
tory between manoguayabo and san
jose de ocoa and maybe she hadnt
even gone that way she didnt want
me to butt in that was plain enough

are you planting

     the lover of the garden and
  the home will find many other
  articles of timely interest in this
  issue of your home a mac-
  fadden publication

     it went on sale at all news
  stands on april rd for twenty-
  five cents a copy

  all i knew for a certainty was that
she hadnt booked passage on a ship
to the states though i wished she
had

  five days later i heard a knock
on the door at four oclock in the
morning then i heard a lot of sob-
bing i got up and went to see what
was what

  it was the maid who had gone with
sis she was ragged because thorns
had almost stripped her and what i
could see of her body tlius exposed
was bruised and bleeding her feet
were raw and crimson from much
running over sharp rocks

  your sister she wailed then
stopped

  yes i said my sister what of
her and i shook the maid until her
teeth rattled

e had plenty of provisions a
map of the country   went
on the maid

  listen i told her if you were a
witness answering questions before a
court-martial theyd let you tell your
family history and the state of the
weather past and present before
theyd make you answer directly but
im not a court-martial what about
sis

  captured by gavilleros she
wailed fought until they over-
powered her but refused to listen to
the pleading of their jefe who tossed
her into a hut and told her hed give
her twenty-four hours to decide what
shed do about it

  where  i shouted shaking her
again

  el jamey back of el tablazo
which is back of san cristobal she
told me straightly and we havent
much time left

  well youve guessed it i tele-
phoned to both tex and shep and had
myself driven out to the field where
two ships were idling at the blocks
all set to go id been to el jamey
mountainous no place to land but a
chute jump now i didnt like chutes
nor airplanes but she was my kid
sister and i didnt like jefe gavilleros
either

  i got in the after pit of texs ship
the maid in the after pit of sheps
and we started off like a pair of
comets skihooting down the field un-
til hades wouldnt have taken out in-
surance on either one of us

ell and what do you think
shep started circling madly cir-
cling ill admit for whole handfuls of
altitude while tex started for el
jamey by the shortest route which
took not too much account of the tree
tops that intervened and when i say
he traveled i mean just that

  it goes to show what love will do

  in a trice because their sweetheart
was in trouble the two might
have changed minds all texs pre-
conceived ideas went into the discard
as he flashed toward el jamey at a
hundred and thirty miles an hour just
above the tree tops the exhaust
flames bathed the sides of the ship un-
til i had a hunch wed be going down
in flames long before el jamey was
reached

  far above us eight thousand feet
up at least i could see the exhaust
flames of sheps ship and he was
making time too

  then far ahead where el jamey
was supposed to be we could see a
light which looked like the light-glow
above a big city though i knew el
jamey was little more than a name
and not one with which to conjure
either

  ten minutes later i knew the an-
swer the jungle there was a raging
furnace

  my heart in my mouth forgetting
my own fears on the instant i leaned
forward literally willing our ship to
greater speed as we approached the
light grew brighter the maid had
told me the approximate location of
the gavillero encampment and i could
locate el jamey itself from the con-
formation of the ground about it and
by the fact that it was on the bank
of a mountain stream whose name at
this moment i dont remember

  well we reached el jamey well
ahead of shep and tex was looking
over the side of the ship down upon
a clearing no bigger than a table
cloth all mountains here and the
natives had merely cleared away a

 strip of jungle in which to build this
 settlement a clearing so up-and-down
 that a fly couldnt have alighted upon
 it without breaking his neck

   how could we do anything for sis
 the clearing was a furnace because
 all the jungle around it was in seeth-
 ing flames the clearing was crowded
 proof that the gaviueros had been
 trapped by the fire

   low down swooped tex driving
 for the clearing already we could
 feel the terrific heat which rushed up
 at us but i didnt mind i was
 watching the clearing for sis i could
 make out the natives as we swooped
 over and they certainly were scared
 pink

 they held up their arms to us as
 though they prayed then i saw sis
 recognizable because she was the only
 woman there who was dressed in
 breeches and her hair was hanging
 around her shoulders

   and how could we help

   jump sure and only get into the
 trap sis was already in getting in
 and dying with her wouldnt help sis
 getting in and getting back out with
 her would help

   and nothing but that side hill to
 land on

   i looked up at sheps ship as we
 swooped over zooming for altitude
 from which to dive back and saw a
 black bundle come catapulting down
 from the ship good lord what could
 shep be thinking that maid with
 him couldnt fly a ship

   and besides i saw that shep be-
 cause of his high altitude the winds
 or something was going to land out-
 side the clearing outside the circle of
 flames which hedged the clearing in
 his chute filled with air and he was
 striving with might and main by pull-
 ing on the shrouds to get into the
 flame-swept clearing his ship was
 spinning down too and i watched for
 another figure the figure of the maid
 to come catapulting down behind
 shep

   but no such figure showed and the
 spinning ship disappeared behind the
 side of a mountain shoulder as we
 tex and i banked around and came
 back well tex couldnt land here
 neither could shep it looked sort of
 up to me i slapped tex on the
 shoulder and signaled that i wanted
 to jump

    instantly a grin of relief on his
 face he nosed up half stalled and i
 went over at about seven hundred
 feet i forgot that it was my first
 jump forgot to be afraid because of
 the fact that the heat which reached
 up for me was burning my eyebrows
 off before i had any more than nicely
 got started down

    i was going to hit the clearing all
 right and then what

    i struck and my whole body seemed
 to shrivel with the heat sis came
 running for me i grabbed her around
 the waist we looked up at tex
 swooping in again and then up at
 shep who was just disappearing into
 the jungle outside the flames i

    i felt like uttering a wail of despair

issue of

trapped sis and i though there was
relief in the fact that we were going
out together

  i even felt sorry for the gavilleros
who were trapped widi us the best
tiling die natives did however
was die so though their cries to the
virgin for forgiveness and mercy
bothered me i didnt pity them over-
much

  howd this happen sis i yelled
at her above die roar of the flames

  i tried to escape she cried her
face as red as a beet with the heat
and couldnt make it so i set fire
to my hut knowing they wouldnt
leave me to roast and this is the re-
sult

i looked all around i had an idea
that without sis i might manage to
get through but sisd never make it

  over our head roared texs ship i
looked up again and gasped in sur-
prise and debelief tex was going to
set his ship down on that side hill

  he came stalling in doing every-
thing under the sun to his ship to cut
his flying speed trying to keep her at
an angle so he wouldnt crack her up
getting in and as the lord is my wit-
ness he touched his trucks to the side
of that hill i saw what he intended
doing in time and yelled my head off
to the natives to them maybe this
bird from the skies was a messenger
from on high come down to take
them out of danger

  maybe thats why they conquered
their fear of the bird anyway at my
command a gang of them tailed onto
the ship stopped its rolling keeping
out of die prop by the grace of what-
ever it is that looks after fools drunk-
ards and primitives and tex jumped
out

  tut her in the pit i yelled at him
i think i can get out of here if im
alone

  you didnt think shouted tex in
return that t dropped in for you did

you his face was haggard and set

  well despite the fact diat it seemed
hopeless still it was our only hope
we tailed die ship around until she
pointed the long way of the clearing
it was like trying to take off on the
roof of a house and die natives held
onto her while tex revved her up

  at his signal having absorbed his
few words of instruction via me as
interpreter the natives held the ship
until she was blasting for a million
then diey let her go

  i thought shed never get off

  the fire from that inferno fairly
bathed the ship as she finally left the
ground and tex lifted her if the fire
hadnt burned off the tops of the trees
tex would have taken em with his
landing gear

  but they were away and a disap-
pointed gang of natives was left be-
hind wondering just what theyd got
out of helping their prisoner away

  i asked for the jefe

  will you promise to go to the
capital city and turn in your arms if
ill get you out of here you and all
your men i shouted at him

  hed have promised anything then
just to get away so he nodded his
head

  just as i started off my blouse over
my head toward the spot i had picked
because the fire was thinnest there a
blackened figure with hair burned off
pants in rags and smoking came
through that selfsame thin place and
ran wildly stumblingly toward us

  yep it was shep

  the maid  i began

  fool lie shouted didnt you see
me dump her out at the field at the
last minute we needed a pit for
your sis to sit in when we got her
where is she 

  gone with tex i said and we
are going

  shep led the way because he knew
it it led along the stream into which
we wallowed like so many pigs soak-

ing our clothes by the simple ex-
pedient of dropping down and rolling
in the water every ten feet or so and
of crawling on our bellies noses and
faces under when the going got too
hot

  we got out and the gavilleros de-
cided that a promise given under
stress was no soap and that left to
their own devices theyd have found
the way out themselves without our
help

  so shep pulled his gun on em it
was wet and probably wouldnt fire
but diey didnt know that a chap
who could drop out of the sky then
come through fire without burning to
death might be able to make even
water-logged guns fire taking the
hint i pulled my gun also

  fortunately for us the natives had
left the clearing without theirs which
were inside a bunch of huts that by
now were more or less in a state of
ashes

  it was dusk of that evening before
we got back to the city

  i told the commanding general of
sheps heroic jump of his trip
through the flames of how his quick-
ness of wit had corailed the gavil-
leros and made it possible for us to
bring them in shep was a hero the
c g recommended him for a medal
of some kind and overlooked the loss
of the de haviland

ohep was the real hero i told
sis you oughta take him he
had guts through air fire and water
he came to us and if it hadnt been for
him i wouldnt be here now

  he rescued you bud says sis to
me but tex rescued me which
makes a difference shep always
played to the grand-stand and i admit
hes given me many a thrill but
brains win out in the long run be-
sides the padre married me to tex
before you and shep got in with your
prisoners

a flyer avtio c ou ljnt fly

high again hed have to try once more

  he opened the throtde wide and
roared across the field at a hundred
miles an hour once more he veered
off for a landing dimly he saw groups
of men on the ground

  this time he calculated the glide cor-
rectly but as the ground rushed closer
and closer to him out of the drizzling
dusk he became panic-stricken gave her
the gun and once more roared across
the field-this time hardly five feet from
the ground

  jones was near exhaustion and his
nerves were almost shattered he de-
cided to put everything into one more
try and if things didnt work out to
stick her into the ground and have done
with it

  calmed by his resignation to the ap-
parendy inevitable he calculated his
glide excellently jones pulled back on
the stick and resigned himself to what
might happen he had leveled off just
a moment too soon the plane had not

               continued from page 

what will a man do

  the woman he loved was so lonely
when he took those long trips and

day when that little harmless flirta-

-but

lost enough speed and refused to settle

  up went the nose the wings wob-
bled as the ship threatened to turn over
and crash there she wobbled for the
tiniest fraction of a second

  then she mushed bang went the
tail skid bang went the landing gear
surely those wheels were flattened no
she was rolling across the field she
was stopping

  it was done

  done done done jones wilted he
wanted to quit-to quit now but the
sight of a still shoulder on the edge of
the forward cockpit roused him wearily
he opened the throttle turned the ship
on the ground and taxied up to the han-
gars

  there ten or fifteen men now only
unidentified shadows in the dark sur-
rounded the plane

  hey whats the idea of the funny
landing

  did you get the governors paper

  wheres that paper jims ready to

take it to the hotel its about timet
the governor wants it

  jones stood up in his cockpit

  he found himself talking foolishly
flatly matter of fact

  the major there hes hurt youd
better get some one right now to look at
the major hes hurt youd better get
a doctor quick

  two men nearest the plane climbed
quickly up beside the major

  some one farther away asked again
wheres that paper 

  oh yes said jones the paper
the majors got it tucked inside his
flying suit

  one of the men beside the major ex-
tracted the manila envelope and handed
it to some one else who hurried away
with it then the man beside the major
straightened up suddenly

  his heads bleeding hes knocked
  cold

  he turned to jones

  ilow did this happen how long
ago

  the crowd was hushed

  the windshield hit him jones told
the man about an hour ago i think
dont ask fool questions get a doctor

  then many pairs of hands reached up
to help bring the majors limp form
from the cockpit and huddled about him
murmuring excitedly as they bore him
away

  jones climbed wearily out of the cock-
pit and started toward a hangar he
staggered

  a stout arm went about his waist and
a strong bony hand gripped one of his

  attaboy jones old kid said
blackie softly

  but if private jones was deserted by
the mob that night the mob was swayed
the other way a short time later with so
much enthusiasm that the following an-
nouncement appeared on the squadron
bulletin board

  at a special meeting of the squad-
ron thursday night private j k jones
in recognition of his service with the
squadron and in recognition of his cool
and courageous action the day major
walters was injured by a broken wind-
shield was elected observer-ieutenant
to fill an existing vacancy other va-
cancies will be filled at a future regular
meeting

  it was sunday afternoon drill a
tall young man stepped out of the offi-
cers locker room and surveyed the
crowd hanging on the fence he strode
this way and that because he wore a
brand new uniform with the insignia of

second lieutenant on its shoulders he
glanced again at the crowd and from a
pocket drew helmet and goggles and
fitted them nonchalantly on his head
he started toward the fence

  about that time corporal sprague
had sighted at the fence a young lady
with indescribably disturbing blue eyes
whose attention it had been his pleasure
to attract several weeks earlier he
made his way to the young lady and re-
minded her of their former acquain-
tance when the blue eyes lighted with
recognition he decided to waste no more
time and then and there made known
his name and was given hers in return

  when he was asking her for her tele-
phone number she interrupted him

  oh theres that man i was asking
you about the other sunday that one
in the uniform coming right this way
who is he

  corporal sprague sighed

  hey jones he called come here

  jones diverted his steps to corporal
sprague reclining against the fence
then his eyes caught the blue ones he
flushed but masked it under a new air
of military dignity

  say said corporal sprague i
want you to meet a friend of mine miss
june marvin this is lieutenant
jones

  the lieutenant slightly startled its
wearer in spite of the parade he had
been staging he had for the moment for-
gotten he flushed again a little with
guilt a little with newborn pride

  how glad he was that he had not met
her earlier then there would have
been no lieutenant and his introduc-
tion more than likely would have been
carried out with allegedly humorous
side remarks

  he removed his helmet and goggles
and bowed gravely

  how do you do

miss marvin almost gasped in
the face of such gallantry and
splendor corporal sprague sighed
again and retired

  oh she burst out im so glad to
meet you lieutenant jones ive heard
so much about your belonging to the
helmet and goggle brigade and all

  lieutenant jones started and looked
at her suspiciously no she was not
kidding

  er-yes yes he said would you
like to look over the falcons they are
great ships

  with a bored glance at the planes
lieutenant jones fitted his helmet and
goggles and took the young ladys arm

yours truly

   joseph luscalzo
    sedgwick st chicago illinois

 dear mr luscalzo

   in answer to your questions we have
 the following to advise

   	a pilot can get insurance on his
 life in the united states

   	there is no set limit as to the age
 of a pilot many boys flying at the age
 of sixteen

   	there are more airplanes manu-
 factured in the united states than in
 any other country in the world

   	as to the meaning of r- this
 refers to the number and letter of the
 model of the plane

   	a fuselage is a body i suggest
 that you look in the dictionary where
 this is more fully explained

   	france holds the speed record of
 an airplane which is  miles an hour

   	a berbois monoplane equipped
 with a  horsepower hispano-suiza
 motor holds the speed record

   	as to the number of years it takes
 to become a pilot this would be impos-
 sible to give some men are good pilots
 in six months and others are not good
 pilots in that many years

   	the government does not furnish
 you with a plane contracts for carry-
 ing mail are let out to various aviation
 companies who employ pilots

   gentlemen

   we have a couple of questions we
 would like explained to us

   	can a plane while in the air
 stop its motor completely that is
 can the pilot shut the motor off
 for an indefinite time dive and with
 the aid of the propeller on the
 principal of a chitch in a car start
 its motor again

   	why not self-starters on
   planest

   we read your flying stories each
 week and like them very much
 but cant you drop the serialsf

   thanking you much in advance
 for your kind attention

                russel burke
   leonard payne
   the castle club callas pa

 dear mr burke and mr payne
 replying to your letter would advise
 that it is quite possible for a pilot to
 shut his motor off completely in the
 air and dive until his propeller rotates
 from the force of the air contact his
 motor and start it again

   as to your suggestion for self-
 starters on planes please be advised
 that most of the new airplanes of large
 size used today are equipped wid self-
 starters and have been for some three
 years

  sincerely yours

                  joseph wood
  box  glossmere pa

dear mr wood

   replying to your letter in answer to
your first question which refers to wing
dope i suggest that you find this under
that heading in the aviation dictionary
wing dope is a highly concentrated
varnish which has a tendency of draw-
ing the irish linen to which it is applied
very tight and at die same time making
it waterproof it can be bought at any
store or factory handling aviation ma-
terials the price is about the same
as the ordinary high-class varnish

   as to the possibilities of building a
succesful biplane and using a motor-
cycle engine for a power plant i would
say that it is quite possible as it has
been done in the united states several
times however it requires first class

blueprints and a close application to
them

  if we can be of any further service to
your please command us

  gentlemen

    as a constant reader of flying
  stories i am taking this oppor-
  tunity to make use of your ad-
  visory board i should like to
  know if it is possible for a young
  man about twenty years old to con
  struct an airplane

    the heath tomboy or para-
  sol are the type of plane which 
  should like to build would it be
  possible to learn to fly by ones
  self t during the winter months i
  could equip the plane with skis and
  try hedge-hopping as there are
  miles of level stretches around
  montreal

    hope you can find time to an-
  swer

very truly yours

               hugh lamb jr
  marcil avenue n d de g
 montreal quebec

dear mr lamb

  in answer to your question as to the
possibility of building an airplane by
yourself would say diat tiiis has been
done by many young men in the united
states

  the heath tomboy or parasol are
both good types of planes and with the
plans well drawn up which they will
furnish to you as i understand it it
will be quite possible for you to con-
struct one of these types easily

  as to the possibility of leaching
yourself to fly i would not attempt this
as to hedge-hopping and so forth
around the ground that ci  be done
very easily while at the i me time
teaching yourself the rudiments of
actual flight but i would advise strongly
your taking a few lessons in die air
with an instructor before attempting a
solo flight

i hope this answers your question

sincerely yours
macfadden aviation advisory board

  gentlemen

    i am glad you have answered my
  aviation questions

     i would like if you please to an-
  swer these two questions the
  first one is why dont they have
  driving in both drivers and gun-
  ners pit so in case anything hap-
  pens to the driver the gunner can
  drive the plane to the ground and
  save the airplane and both of them-
  selves 

    the second is why is wire at-
  tached to the top of the wings on
  the airplanet

yours truly

dear albert

  many people have wanted to know
why there were no controls in the
gunners cockpit because of the fact
that the gunners cockpit of an army
aircraft is so small and the fact that
lie must stand up most of the time in
firing his gun on all sides of the cock-
pit makes it impossible and impractica-
ble to have controls there

  the wires attached to the top of the
wings of an airplane are called the
cabane supporting wires these lend
support and stability to the plane when
flying the rush of air against the
wing of an airplane is so great that
the wing has a tendency at times to
buckle and the cabane wires hold it
in place against such an emergency
good luck to you albert
your friends

  dear sirs

     recently a friend and myself
  had an argument concerning the
  ford tri-motored plane as ar-
  guments go im sure that im
  right and he is equally sure that
  he is

     while this is not a technical
  question we hope that you zvill
  play the role of the dove and the
  olive branch long enough to settle
  our differences

     what is the number of r p in
  of the ford motors and how
  many motors must be going to
  maintain flying speed

     thanking you in advance i am
  ward w miller
   e th pl

   los angeles california

dear mr miller

  your reference to ford motors is a
little vague inasmuch as the ford
airplane is equipped with two types of
motors the -at-e and the -at
are equipped with wright w w and
the -at-b is equipped with  p  w
wasp motors

  the rating of the wasp engine is
 horsepower at  rpm and on
the wright t- it is  horsepower
at  rpm

  two motors must be running to
maintain a flight to destination and
with only one motor the ship has a
very long gliding angle approximate-
ly thirty miles

very truly yours

  dear sirs

    i have been reading your
  magazines and find them interest-
  ing

    could i get some pointers
  please

   	could i get a list of some good
     schools and the price and the
     course

  	after a person completes a
    course how can he get a job

  	how healthy must he be as
    for myself i have to wear
    glasses while reading or my
    eyes get sore

  	how much time of the day
    does it take to go to school

and for how many months

  	i have been thinking of join-
    ing the army but there seems
    to be no opening and i am
    afraid of my eyes what
    would you advise me to do as
    i am terribly interested in
    aviation and would do almost
    anything to get into it

  	do you know anything about
    the universal air lines as
    we have a port here i thought
    possibly the school would be
    good here and i would like
    very much to know if they hire
    their own fellows that complete
    the course or what they do
    with them

    i dont know how to thank you
    for this information but i am
    enclosing thanks just the same

yours truly

  we could easily supply you with a
list of good schools and prices
courses etc but inasmuch as there
are about three hundred and fifty
schools in the united states it would
be impossible to give you a complete
list and as you are living in min-
neapolis we are taking this opportun-
ity of recommending you to the best
school that we have on file nearest
the locality of your home this is
the greer college  wabash ave-
nue chicago iii we believe it
would be better to give you the in-
formation which you ask on this one
school so that you could have ail idea
as to just what a really fine school
offers a pupil

  in answer to your second question
as to how you will find a position
upon completion of your course would
say that the greer college operates a
very large employment department
which will gladly assist you in finding
a position while you are in training or
after you have completed the course
which you find most satisfactory

  as to your health please be advised
that before a pilot can obtain a license
from the department of commerce he
must take and pass the physical exam-
ination required by that department
this examination can be made by an
appointed doctor in minneapolis if you
wish or after you arrive in chicago

  as to the amount of time such a
course would take that would depend
greatly upon yourself if you could
attend a school all day you would fin-
ish that much sooner but if you had
to work during a part of the day it
would of course take longer the
average pupil takes four months to fin-
ish the greer flying course we would
sincerely recommend that you write to
the greer college from which you may
obtain full data as to their courses
etc with such a training behind
you your future would be assured

  we regret to say that we have no
information whatever on the univer-
sal air lines

can astrology
guide me
in the
solution of my
various
problems

  the above is a question that
has been asked by many per-
sons who have not had the op-
portunity of making a first hand
investigation of the science

  with all the mathematical
accuracy with which this the
most ancient of all sciences is
calculated there is nothing
fatalistic about it it is more of
a means for averting some of the
blows of fate and making more
of the opportune moments of
life

   it is an old astrological maxim
the stars foretell but cannot
compel

  from a broad point of view
there are no good or evil
planets the so called evil
brings the discipline necessary
for building character or un-
folding the spiritual side

perhaps this science can help
you to solve your problems of

  bend every effort to learn
your correct birthtime if it is
not definite get as close as
possible send a photograph
and let me have the name of
your birthplace

  write in detail the condition
of your mind and a description
of the problem you ai con-
fronted with

  my fee is ten dollars in ad-
vance i will carefully and ac-
curately calculate and draw up
your birth chart and progres-
sive chart for the coming year
i will advise you of the short-
comings in your character as i
see them there are persons
who have greatly improved
their lives through the prac-
tical use of astrology and among
them could be listed some of the
greatest figures in the world
perhaps one of the most effec-
tive users of astrology in recent
years has been mussolini

   it is at least worth ten dollars
to find out what astrology can
do for you is it not

fat enters the body when food is consumed in

exercise

all other ills of the body may sometimes fail to
respond even when the best known methods are
applied not so with obesity the cause and
elimination of obesity is a matter of mathematics
and there is no argument about it

seats in all of the sky-writing planes
this is due to several reasons the most
significant of which is that pilots who
fought in the air have learned the tricks
of stunting which are so essential to the
business

  captain alexander lingham a for-
mer british army man succeeded coll-
yer mr cameron continued it was
lie who wrote over times square in
new york city in july  join the
c m t c pilot e d c heine who
is now in the automobile business in de-
troit was the first to use colored smoke
that was in april  when he wrote
here again the colored smoke was
not entirely successful but we got some
ideas

when the skywriting corpora-
tion is assigned to a new job the
pilots are acquainted with the message
to be written in the air they work on a
blackboard at first until they have
figured out the shortest way in which
to cover the entire group of letters they
practice in the air until they have it let-
ter-perfect they dare almost anything
except the possibility of an error in
spelling thus far no one has invented
a suitable eraser to eliminate a mistake
in the air

  no two pilots write alike said mr
cameron i can tell who is up by
glancing at the writing

  all writing is done on a horizontal
plane of course as it would be im-
possible otherwise for the people below
to read it furthermore it would be
impossible for a plane of the type used
to climb at an angle steep enough for
vertical writing

  at ten thousand feet the prevailing
wind is westerly and gentle to per-
form effectively a pilot requires a steady
breeze or still better no wind at all

  we are always at the mercy of the
weather mr cameron explained it
is necessary to have a clear blue sky
and a steady wind not exceeding forty
miles an hour

  there are however exceptions to
this rule if the message is to he ex-
ceptionally brief it is practical to write
in a wind at fifty miles an hour

  we had a job over philadelphia in
february  mr cameron recalled
to advertise lindberghs story we
for the philadelphia bulletin we made
those letters over a mile long we could
have done it in a high wind but as it
happened we got a lucky break in the
weather

  a variable wind makes sky-writing
impossible the pilot when he quits
the ground must allow for wind velo-
city he nearly always starts the first
letter far into the wind so that by the
time he has finished the word it will
hang directly over the city he must
forever keep the letters aligned ac-
cording to mr cameron no two flyers
employ the same scheme in getting this
result one will use the hudson river
in lining his words over new york

another selects a long avenue or street
a third gets results by holding the
shadow of one wing strut across the
same rib of his lower wing

  with letters half a mile high and a
quarter of a mile wide the average
message extends from four to six miles
in length down below the gaping
throngs will watch a curving plane as it
covers tliis distance in the space of a
few minutes it seems to write with
almost leisurely strokes and suddenly
as the word is finished the plane itself
is momentarily invisible it is then that
the pilot has cut off die smoke valve

  have any of your men ever cracked
up i asked mr cameron

  no theyve been lucky or too
clever they always have altitude and
if anything goes wrong theyve got a
good chance to glide to a landing some-
where and of course our men are so
at ease in the air that it is second na-
ture for diem to handle their ships in
emergency

  captain o c leboutillier a british
war ace has been flying over new york
city during the winter of - to
his intimates the captain is known as
boots they say of him that he han-
dles a pursuit plane as a veteran cow-
puncher controls an exceedingly fast
and tender-mouthed pony the winds
were not so good and captain leboutil-
lier nearly began to write somewhere
over new jersey

look here boots said a flying
mate without smiling whats the idea
youre writing over jersey you ought
to know the people there dont read
boots nodded cheerfully

  i know he replied straight-faced
but i allow for the drift every word
i write hangs over new york those
jersey fellows just think its steam es-
caping from the factories

  sky-writing is now an established
method of advertising in nearly every
civilized nation on the globe the cor-
poration operates in australia france
germany switzerland denmark hol-
land austria hungary and poland in
addition to england and the united
states more than five thousand mes-
sages have been delivered in a variety
of languages wherever the smoke
words appear it is a foregone conclu-
sion that thousands of straining eyes
are gazing upward

the thing has ceased to be a novelty
but people still pause in their occupa-
tions not only to read the graceful
words that spread across the sky but
to watch and marvel as the plane loops
and levels off across the blue-board of
the heights

  the corporation met with opposition
in england an objection was raised
that the new form of advertising
sooner or later would mar die heavens
as bill-boards already spoil die beauty
of the hills and highways

  a motion in the house of lords to
prohibit sky-writing was voted down

when anszvering advertisements
may 

flying stories



 when lord birkenhead reminded the
 house that even the ex-kaiser claimed
 only the land and the sea but made no
 effort to seize the air his argument
 was supported by the duke of suther-
 land who contended that sky-writing
 was of actual value to aviation for the
 reason that it kept pilots in constant
 training

   within the past year two new forms
 of aerial advertising have been de-
 veloped one is the voice of the sky
 the other the flying signboard the
 first consists of a loud-speaking appa-
 ratus attached to a plane which broad-
 casts the voice to the ground the
 second is a bi-motored keystone plane
 with two ninety-foot electric neon
 signs attached to the lower wing this
 operates at night and flashes words in
 electric letters to those below

   in the meanwhile as sky-writing be-
 comes more popular major jack
 savage and captain cyril turner
 along with other aces of the war are
 working to perfect new methods and
 sooner or later in the opinion of mr
 cameron they will succeed color
 writing is a possibility of the not-dis-
 tant future when this is perfected it
 will be possible to write against the

 background of the clouds making the
 weather a less important factor than
 it is today

   whenever i watch one of our
 planes carving a message said mr
 cameron i am always carried back
 to thoughts of those days over the lines
 were writing messages of peace now
 in words of smoke those boys were
 writing death and destruction then in
 fire and steel but they have to know
 their stuff today just as they did then
 they arent allowed any more second
 chances now than ever

   and so the handwriting is on the
 wall-of the heavens it is like the in-
 scription so aptly described by omar
 khayyam in his rubaiyat

 the moving finger writes and
    having writ

 moves on nor all your piety nor wit

   shall lure it back to cancel half a
     line

 nor all your tears wash out a word
     of it

   that also is the way of the sky-
 writing s e- once the word is
 written just try your piety and wit on
 it and no weeping will wash the slate

 many and have had plenty of excite-
 ment in every one

    i was racing a high-powered single-
 seater fighting machine one i had
 bought from the government i was
 scratch man last to leave the mark
 because my machine had the greatest
 handicap as we all stood toeing the
 line engines roaring idly i was careless
 enough to let mine stop

    as will happen to the best regulated
 motors ground or aerial it would not
 restart i fussed and fumed but when
 my flag went down there i was im-
 mobile

 the precious seconds passed while
 the mechanic swung furiously sud-
 denly one bright young engineer dashed
 up with a booster magneto with his
 bare hands he pressed the terminals
 against two of the spark-plugs

    one swing from the man in front and
 she roared into action

   let er go shouted the boy who
 had put the spark in the spark-plugs he
 dropped flat on the ground under a
 wing while i shot across him onto the
 course

    i never put so much into a race all
 my rivals were in front so my course
 was marked clear for me all i had to
 do was to get the speed out of my ship
 it was a fifty-mile race on a triangular
 course

    i flitted along the surface of the mea-
 dows utterly regardless of the feelings
 of the cows and horses whose content-
 ment i was disturbing

   when i came to the two turning
 points both of which happened to be
 breweries i had the feeling that you
 could not have inserted a playing-card
 please mention this magasine

 between my wing-tip and the smoke
 stacks that served as pylons the others
 were just ahead of me and the roar was
 deafening

    the last few seconds were one concen-
 trated thrill the haudicappers had
 done their work well and the machines
 were bunched together for the finish if
 there were cheers from the crowd they
 were unheard by the jockeys of those
 ear-splitting steeds of the air

   i had to keep clear of them so that
 the wash from my propeller would not
 disturb the others but something in my
 engine responded to the mental call i
 made upon it

    with a mighty thunder like an artil-
 lery barrage we streaked past the others
 like a meteor and dove across the finish
 line a close second it would be hard
 to forget a race like that

   with the same machine the following
 year i had an entirely different kind of
 thrill i had loaned it during the winter
 to a group of military aviators on condi-
 tion that they kept it insured it had a
 good hard record of winters play be-
 hind it when i took it over for the
 summers races

   the first race was at southampton in
 june five laps of a five-mile course
 free-for-all half way around the third
 lap while i was straining to drag the
 last ounce of power out of her a com-
 plete cylinder head blew off

   it was an old hispano water-cooled
 engine and you can guess what hap-
 pened she finished the course spouting
 fire and smoke and clouds of steam at
 the same time pouring boiling water
 back onto wretched me

   i was rapidly becoming hard-boiled
 when we finished the race though my

howl lost

            i weighed  lbs i after
            trying many ways to reduce
            a loading insurance medical

flying volcano could hardly be expected
to take a place

  breaks lucky and otherwise always
seem to come in bunches once i had
a whole month of unlucky breaks they
began when  had to get out and push
my machine about in a muddy field

  in so doing i wrenched my back
rather painfully-afterwards i discov-
ered one of the vertebrae was broken
my doctor put me in plaster for several
days and it looked as though i was out
of flying for some time to come

  but just then came the great general
strike all the aircraft in the country
were pressed into service for carrying
the mails and distributing newspapers
after much persuasion my good doctor
agreed to let me up after winding thirty-
six yards of adhesive tape around me
and making me promise i would never
straighten up physically till he let me

of course i intended to keep my
promise and i set out with the best
of intentions of taking care of myself
captain frank t courtney who later
made the transatlantic attempt from
england said i had the funniest lug-
gage he had ever seen i toured the
country with a blue eider-down quilt to
lie on at night together with three or
four strong pillows and a strong walk-
ing-stick for ground use

  i flew regularly with consignments of
the daily mail which we pilots dis-
tributed to all the cities when the rail-
roads ceased to run after four or five
days i found i could straighten up all
right-and who would want to go
around all humped up any longer than
necessary

  now came the problem of taking the
adhesive tape off any one who has tried
to remove a porous plaster will have a
faint idea of my predicament with over
a hundred feet of tape glued to my kin

  i tried hot water gasoline turpen-
tine-nothing would touch it it hurt
so much at every pull that i began to
fear i was permanently mummified in
adhesive tape

  but finally i had a bright thought
and went to a local dentist he very
kindly put me to sleep with his gas and
while i was mercifully unconscious he
peeled off the tape

  there were some twenty light planes
in use during the strike which flew some

	miles and helped greatly in
keeping the papers and mails going the
little moths like mine flew over

	miles without a mishap

  the next break was my own fault en-
tirely i was carrying about  pounds
of newspapers from folkestone to lon-
don and was rash enough to swing my
propeller with the switch on

  it immediately backfired of course
and the first finger and thumb of my left
hand were broken it really was not as
painful as it sounds-it numbed me at
the time but the pain did not start till
half an hour later when i was in the
air

  four days later i was bitten again
also through my own fault it was an-
other occasion on which i paid for my
conceit i was on a military flying field
with a score of officers and mechanics
about only too eager to help me

  but i wanted to show how easily i
could start my engine and plane unaided
it backfired again this time my right
wrist was broken i felt i had to go on
and finish the journey for many were
depending upon me but it was rather
terrifying

  fortunately i was alone or i certain-
ly would not have flown for i felt sick
and weak with the pain unable to hold
the stick either with my bandaged left
hand or my newly broken right one i
held the joystick in the hollow of my
right elbow keeping it in place with the
back of my left hand

  i flew very low and slowly so that i
would not hit too hard if i did faint and
lose control i managed to pull through
all right which shows what one can do
when necessary

  although self-starters have been used
on airplanes so far they have proved too
heavy and cumbersome one of the first
things the student learns is how to start
his own engine it is really very easy
on light engines

  you just place the palm of both hands
on the blade of the propeller previously
turned as high as you can reach then
with the switch turned off you swing
the blade several times to draw gas into
the cylinders

  now with the switch on one easy
swing should start the engine with a
bang of course any engine will back-
fire sometimes but this will cause no
danger if your fingers do not grasp the
edge of the blade too tight a grip on
the crank-handle of an automobile will
do quite as much damage to hands and
arms as the wrong grip on a propeller
its just a case of knowing how and of
being careful-automatically

  i went into flying because it entranced
me from the first my first trip in the
air however was made because i was in
a hurry i had just heard of the open-
ing of an international athletic con-
ference in prague it was the very next
day so the only way i could get there
was to fly

   called the nearest air-field found a
pilot and plane and so embarked on my
flying career from that day on i have
been up in the air just as much as i
could

parachute drops appear more
 thrilling to the ground observer than
to the performer i made many drops
during my exhibition and barnstorm-
ing tours but one adventure stands out
in my recollection as the least expected
and the most thrilling it was one of
my closest calls for it might have ended
very seriously

  i was stunting at hereford and was
to make a parachute drop from a plane
piloted by a very skilful pilot-i believe
that if he had not been so skilful i
would not be telling this tale today i
had climbed out of the cockpit and was
on the point of jumping into space at the
word from my pilot when suddenly the
engine went wrong

  it was quite a different drop and land-
ing than either of us had expected-or
the crowd either only the pilot knows
how we managed to miss trees and vari-
ous other obstacles to a peaceful landing
i wondered more than once before our

flying stories



feet were safely on mother earth again
whether it would not have been as well
to have hopped off and taken my chances
of fouling the machine as it fell i shall
tell you more about that mishap when i
recount my parachute experiences

one of my most remarkable and
least expected of adventures oc-
curred during my -mile flight
from cape town to england i had
lived in central africa for some years
and i well knew the dangers of the suns
rays near the equator no white person
exposes his head to those actinic rays
unless he wishes to end it all

  but when i was flying the -mile
hop from pretoria to bylawayo on my
long flight i was twenty-one degrees
south of the equator anticipating no
trouble i wore only my flying helmet
i was gazing down at the flat plains and
hills ahead of me when suddenly i felt
a dull ache in the back of my head neck
and shoulders

  i	had had two light attacks of sun-
stroke and knew well enough what i
was up against but my belated efforts

 were too late to stave off unconscious-
 ness i remember saying to myself
 well my dear you have flown
 your last flight  and heading my
 plane for the ground then all went
 black i shall tell you later on how and
 where i awoke-by no means certain at
 first that i had not landed in the next
 world with dark-skinned angels to wait
 upon me

   flying for me has not been loads of
 healthy fun but all over the world i
 have met the finest of good clean pleas-
 ant people every one in aviation is al-
 ways doing his or her best for every
 one else in my next account i shall tell
 about some of the interesting flying-folk
 and how any healthy normal person can
 get into this newest and finest of sports
 and businesses

    i	shall try especially to show girls and
  women how they may tike up this en-
  grossing and constructive hobby in their
  spare time perhaps you would like to
  know my favorite slogan i

 womens place is in the home-

   but next to that-the aerodrome

 continued from page 

 and halted at the edge of the clearing
 the door of the davies cabin was
 opened narrowly and a rifle barrel
 protruded from it

   thats dad cried linda and ran
 into the open he had to get into it
 somehow

   jimmy recognized colonel davies
 as he emerged slowly from the cabin

   theyve probably hit the trail
 south boys theyll pick them up be-
 low jimmy said eagerly

   as the little procession moved out
 across the clearing linda and her
 father met they were waiting to-
 gether with her arm about his shoulder
 when the rest came up colonel da-
 vies keen eyes went straight to
 jimmy

   well young man theres been hell
 to pay around here more action
 egad than ive seen since the meuse-
 argonne

   yes sir jimmy agreed studying
 him swiftly youre all right

   right hell i was just getting
 started

   the colonels eyes went to pierres
 burden

   whos your red cross nurse here
 weve got two more patients in the
 shack warners got a bullet in the
 leg and collins is damned near scared
 to death he chuckled parkers
 with me though confound it we
 had a fine time of it egad 

  he turned and led the way into
 the cabin with linda beside him
 and the others followed big jerry
 wamer greeted them from a bench
 near the window where he sat with

 still

 his long-barreled rifle

  one leg thrust stiffly out before him
      gripping

  part er also with a gun smiled his
  welcome collins who had been
  seated sprang to his feet nervously

  sit down sit down collins old
  please mention this magasine

 davies commanded sharply if you
 dont youll fall down

   jimmy turned to the provincials
 lets hit the trail for those other
 two they wont be far away there
 are more of your hoys coining in but
 theres a chance these birds might
 dodge them well bring dusty i
 first

   well go lieutenant guess you
 can handle the job here all right mac
 and ill round em up

   all right ill see what i can pry
 out of these fellows here while youre
 gone

   as the provincials struck across
 the clearing jimmy turned to the
 others in the room his face was
 haggard and the long strain of his
 sleepless nights and harried days
 struck him with full effect as the ten-
 sion was relieved

   blair this was a great piece of
 work colonel davies was the first
 to speak and his voice shook with
 emotion as he too suddenly sagged
 under the effect of the swift climax

   you can thank your daughter
 colonel said jimmy quietly but
 for her wed never have had a
 chance

   confound it i was afraid shed
 wreck the whole thing davies
 put his arm affectionately around
 lindas waist and drew her close but
 she got you tip here didnt she

   jimmy was on his way here when
 i met him dad

   yes jimmy interrupted gravely
 and i was on my way to a crack-up
 when she pulled me out of it

 briefly he described his rescue
 while the colonel listened marveling
 i say this is news he exclaimed

i knew that linda could fly but-
all i did dad was to fly over
him jimmy pulled himself up and
thats all there was to it you cant
put the blame for this on me

  pierre and his wounded companion
stood uncertainly in the background
while jerry watched them narrowly
from his place the third man lay
motionless at their feet where pierre
had unceremoniously dropped him
jimmy faced them abruptly

  pierre im going to give you a
chance to save your hide

  the man stared at him curiously and
a hopeful light came into his beady eyes

rtell us all you know about this
jl business and youll keep out of the
noose if you lie pierre were going
to hang you

  cobnel davies had stepped closer
and was studying pierres face

  why this fellows one of those
three who came in here to see me
he turned to jimmy i remember
him perfectly

  pierre grinned sure him too
he pointed at the injured man on the
floor odder feller run away

  how about larsen pierre what
did he want

  eh by gar larsen he one ver
bad man

  step by step jimmy pieced together
the tangled skeins of the plot that had
evolved in larsens scheming mind
pierres sweeping admissions veri-
fied his suspicions one by one

  pierre said the big native want
plenty game-set trap lines-kill fur
larsen he paused and looked at
linda he jus want girl want to
kill everbody-

 then he wanted money from
colonel davies pierre

sure the man replied simply
where arc rogers and silton the
policemen jimmys eyes narrowed
bored into those of the native and
again the man shrugged

  dead

the single word startled them all
pierre he show you where the
trapper added and a gleam of cunning
came into his watchful eyes you let
pierre go free he show you

  further questioning was interrupt-
ed by the return of macbriar and
clancy carrying the wounded dusty
farrell between them

  jimmy i thought you were in the
hoosegow he said until i heard
that crate of yours coming in you
all right

  yes i was lucky dusty and
you-whered they get you

  through both legs hang it i had

the

 to come down before i passed out
 loss of blood i guess-weakened me-

 i	couldnt seem to keep the old bus
 flying any longer

   they stretched him out at ease on a
 bunk

   god it looks like a hospital ex-
 claimed jimmy

   yes ive been thinking that for a
 long time colonel davies put in

  macbriar turned to jimmy well
 you can get ready for a couple more
 lieutenant well bring em back
 here

  when the wounded had been made
 as comfortable as was possible under
 the circumstances and pierre sat be-
 neath the watchful gaze of jerry
 warner jimmy and linda drifted to-
 ward the door

  now look here you two the
colonel called after them i dont
propose to be left with this outfit any
longer while you go mooning under
the northern lights

  they turned together and smiled
 back at him but daddy you have
 mr collins said linda glancing at
 the mournful secretary and jerry-
 and mr parker

  go on he told them i want a
 little talk with collins anyhow i want
 to let him know hes fired

   they went out into the gray silence
 a snow owl screeched in the timber
 far off and the lonely call of its mate
 came back the sky still frowned
 menacingly and linda moved close be-
 side jimmy his arm went about
 her and they paused

   she turned to gaze up into his eyes
 jimmy im afraid-afraid of this
 ungava it threatens you

   he smiled gravely

  yes i understand dear its a
 grim country it makes a man dwin-
 dle down to his own significance
 her mood changed and she laughed
 not you jimmy blair she told
 him softly youve whipped it you
 cant feel that way about it

   no it took you to do that linda-
 my brave one impulsively he held her
 close and bent down to kiss her lips

 she drew away after a long ec-
 static moment her eyes misty with
 love her voice when she spoke was
 quivering

  jimmy my dear-well fly in the
 sunlight-when we go hack the sun-
 light-and not the clouds

   he kissed her again held her trem-
 bling form in his arms and gazed
 down into her eyes

   we will my little cloud-breaker
 he laughed gently well go sailing
 into the sun
