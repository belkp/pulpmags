mate think it high time that we teed off
ww on the almost omnipresent theory
of survival of the fittest ever since the
publication approximately a century ago
of the late charles darwins origin of
species this phrase and the supposedly
pragmatic idea behind it have persistently
infiltrated western thought and writing

  by the very nature of subjects frequent-
ly dealt with-alien invasion conquest
colonization and social intercourse among
denizens of other star systems and dimen-
sions-it occurs in science fiction probably
more often than in other fields of what is
sometimes laughingly termed literature in-
creasingly of recent months and years the
goal of survival for its own sake is being
employed as justifiable motivation for the
behavior of heroes and villains alike

darwin gets the blame

  and darwin gets the blame-although
actually neither the phrase nor the thought
were his you will no more find either in
any of his writings than you will find
heaven helps those that help themselves
in the bible-another wide-spread miscon-
ception

  who uttered the latter phrase we do not
know-but guilt for the survival of the
fittest can be laid squarely upon the head-
stone of herbert spencer the man who
sought to tailor through rationalization
darwins theories to fit the ruthless in-
dividualism of the nineteenth century in-
dustrial revolution unfortunately spencer
succeeded so well that we now associate the
words with darwin

  actually darwin was a scientist a man
who assembled enormous amounts of data
and from such facts made certain inferences
logically unassailable he did not attempt
to fit the ages-long evolutionary process
he recorded into the day-to-day existence
of his contemporaries in fact his latter-
day conclusion was quite the reverse of

spencers-that survival seems more likely
to go to those species that practised co-
operation than those who make competition
the keynote of their culture

  it does not take any vast intellectual
insight to discover that the thought be-
hind survival of the fittest has virtually
no relation to fact biology and paleon-
tology are awash with examples that dis-
prove it

take the dodo

  for one there is the saber-tooth tiger
largest and most efficient of all cats a
species whose powers of adjustment and
survival are provable in living room and
alley as well as in the jungle the saber-
tooth for reasons still relatively obscure
disappeared save for museum reconstruc-
tions millions of years ago

  on the other hand there is the dodo-
probably the most helpless and useless
creature except when browned nicely on
a spit ever to turn up on the biological
records it couldnt run it couldnt fight
it couldnt fly it couldnt even sing for its
supper yet it managed to survive in its
antipodean habitat until it fell prey to the
empty dinner pails of numerous hungry
mariners-within the memory of living
man

  for further example take the bald eagle
-our symbolic national bird certainly this
super-hawk tireless in the air keen of
vision and magnificently equipped with
beak and talons ought to be a survival
standout yet it is in great and immediate
danger of vanishing from the scene for-
ever on the other hand the chihuahua and
the pekinese survive and thrive

  no the factors that govern survival of
species and therefore of the individual are
not only complex but have a way of eradicat-
ing the strong with the weak in fact at
times these factors seem to delight in

michael trehearne was to

remember that evening as the
end of the world for him the end of
his familiar life in a familiar earth
the first glimmering vision of the in-

michael trehearne sensed his difference from other men but he little
knew he was a changeling of the only race able to conquer the starsl
credible it began with the man who
spoke to him on the heights behind st
malo by the light of the midsummer
fires

  there was a great crowd of tourists
there come to watch the old breton fes-
tival of the sacred bonfire trehearne
was among them but not of them he
stood alone-he was always alone he
was thinking that the ritual being per-
formed in the wide space of stony turf
was just too quaint to be endured and
wondering why he had bothered with it
when someone spoke to him with casual
intimacy

  in four days we shall be free of all
this going home a good thought isnt
it two years is a long time

  trehearne turned his head and looked
into a face so like his own that he was
startled

  the resemblance was that of a strong
racial stamp rather than any blood kin-
ship if two mohawks had met in the
hills of afghanistan they would have
recognized each other and it was the
same with trehearne and the stranger

  there was the same arrogant bone-
structure the odd and striking beauty
of form and color that seemed to have
no root in any race of earth the long
yellow eyes slightly tilted flecked with
sparks of greenish fire and there was
the same pride in trehearne it was a
lonely bitter thing the stranger bore
his like a banner

  during the moment in which tre-
hearne stared amazed the stranger re-
marked i dont remember seeing you
on the last ship how long have you
been here

  since yesterday answered tre-
hearne and knew as he formed the
words that they were not the ones ex-
pected of him a wild throb of excite-

trefieame saw towy shaim
and sh came to him radiant


  your family-my family forgive
me if i seem impertinent but its impor-
tant to me ive come a long way from
america to cornwall and now to brit-
tany trying to trace down my own line
he paused looking again into that re-
markable face that watched him darkly
handsome darkly mocking in the fire-
light will you tell me your name
kerref said the man slowly i beg
your pardon monsieur the resemblance
is indeed striking i mistook you for one
of my kin

  trehearne was frowning kerrel
he repeated and shook his head my
people were called cahusac before they
went into cornwall

  there was doubtless a connection
said kerrel easily he pointed abruptly
to the open space beyond look-they
begin the final ritual

  the great bonfire had burned low the

ment ran through him he said impul-
sively look here youve mistaken me
for someone else but im glad you did 
in his eagerness he all but clutched the
mans arm i must talk to you
something in the strangers expres-
sion had altered his eyes were now both
wary and startled upon what sub-
ject

monopoly o jzeecl-

ne of the major problems that currently face the writer of science fiction
-stories and may some day confrant qur scientists is the matter of exceeding
the speed of itght many theories hane been suggested-perhaps all of them as
absurd as that early nineteenth-century prognosticatov who foresaw human in-
ability to survive in a railway carriage moving faster them thirty miles per hour

 miss brackett in her very fine nfivel has a new suggestion as to now man
may travel faster than gki mues per second such a monopoly as she con-
ceives is hardly an attractive idea-but t view if human history it is all too
manlike and certainly the thought of star travel th here and now is one of
the most exciting within the range of hrman imagination-the editor


	startling stories

peasants and the fisherfolk some hun-
dreds of them were gathered in a circle
around the windy glow of the flames a
white-bearded old man began to pray
in the craggy breton gaelic

trehearne barely turned his
head his mind was full of the
stranger and of all the things that had
oppressed and worried and driven him
since childhood the nagging little mys-
teries about himself to which now per-
haps he would find the key

  he glanced away only a second fol-
lowing the gesture of kerrels arm but
when he looked back kerrel was gone

  trehearne took half a dozen aimless
steps searching for the man but he had
melted away into the darkness and the
crowd trehearne stopped feeling cold
and furious

  his temper long the bane of a rather
luckless existence reared up and bared
its claws he had always been childishly
sensitive to insults if he could have got
his hands on the contemptuous kerrel
he would have thrashed him he turned
again to the festival controlling him-
self as he had learned painfully to do
realizing that he was being ridiculous
but his face so like that of the vanished
stranger had the look of an angry
apollyon

  the bretons had begun the proces-
sion around the waning fire short bur-
ly men in bright jackets and broad-
brimmed hats sturdy women in aprons
and long skirts their improbable
starched coifs fluttering with ribbons
and lace sabots clumped heavily on the
stony ground

  they would march three times sun-
ward circling the embers and then
solemnly each pick up a pebble and as
solemnly cast it into the coals then they
would scramble for the charred brands
and bear them home to be charms
against fever and lightning and the
murrain until the next midsummer eve

  it struck trehearne that most of
them except the very old looked pain-
fully self-conscious about it all in a
thoroughly bad humor trehearne was
on the point of leaving and then he

saw the girl

  she was standing some ten feet away
from him in the forefront of the crowd
which had shaped itself into a semi-
circle she had wanted him to see her
she was swinging a white handbag like
a lazy pendulum on a long strap and her
gaze was fixed on him she was smiling
her smile was a challenge

  in the reflection of the great bed of
glowing embers trehearne saw that she
was another of kerrels breed-and his
own whatever it might be but it was
not that recognition that made his heart
leap up it was herself

  the red-gold tight danced over her
and perhaps it was only that faery glow
that made her seem more than a hand-
some girl in a white dress only a trick
of wind and starlight perhaps that
made trehearne see in her a change-
ling bright beautiful wicked and wise
-and no more human than lilith

  she had attracted not only his atten-
tion but that of the bretons also the
ritual circle was broken and they were
staring at her and muttering then the
old man who had prayed went toward
her in his seamed weathered face in
his eyes was the spark of an ancient
hatred the shadow of an ancient fear

  the girl flung up her dark head and
laughed but trehearne did not feel like
laughing

  the old man cursed her

  trehearne knew not one word of gael-
ic but he did not need a knowledge of
the tongue nor did he need to have ex-
plained the gesture of angry dismissal
the bretons the old ones had already
picked up their stones for the fire in
another minute they would use them on
the girl

  trehearne strode across the front of
the crowd and caught her roughly by
the arm pulling her away she was still
laughing still mocking as she shouted
something at the old man the words
she spoke might have been gaelic but
they had a different sound and they had
no kindness in them

  the sightseers parted readily as tre-
hearne thrust through them with the
girl the voice of the old man followed
the starmen of llyrdis	

them down the slope of the hill and the
curious tourists stared after them until
they were out of sight

  trehearne dropped her arm then and
demanded what was the matter with
them

the peasant folk have long mem-
ories they dont understand what it is
they remember only that evil things
once happened to them because of us
what sort of evil things

  have there been any new ones since
the beginning her voice held a dry
humor

  they were far from the crowd now
near the beach a late moon was rising
but the walled island city bulked huge
and dark a medieval shadow the girl
was a white wraith all astir with the
salt wind that tumbled her dark hair
and set her skirts to rippling he
thought her eyes were sea-green but in
the moonlight he could not be sure

  are you going to vanish like ker-
rel he asked

  she laughed kerrel is a rude man
i offered myself to make amends
what do they call you 

  shairn

  that doesnt sound breton
doesnt it my other name is un-
pronounceable and means of the silver
toxver

her eyes were very bright in the
moonlight he thought that in
some secret way she was mocking him
but he did not care he said fll stick
to shairn

  they went on down the path to the
beach and sat on the soft warm sand
he told her his own name and she asked
you are american

  fourth generation

  from brittany to cornwall to amer-
ica she murmured musingly oh yes
i heard all that you told kerrel the
years the generations the mingling
of other strains-and still the vardcta
blood breeds irue

  he repeated the word vardda won-
dering

  alt old tribal name youve never
heard it she laughed with pure de-

light youre incredible michael no
wonder kerrel made a mistake

  after a moment of silence she asked
what sort of a man are you michael
what do you do how do you live

  he looked at her keenly do you
really want to know all right ill tell
you im a man who has never been satis-
fied ive never had a woman or a job i
could stay with very long im a flier by
trade but even that seems a dull and
rather childish business and why be-
cause im too good for any of it

  he laughed not without a certain cru-
el humor dont ask me in what way
im too good i seem to be unusually
healthy but thats important only to me
my brain-power has never set the world
on fire i have no tendency to genius
yet somehow ive always felt theres
something lacking either in me or the
world

  shairn nodded absently smoothing a
patch of sand with her palm again he
was conscious of a queer wisdom in her
that did not fit her youth she smiled a
small thing full of secrets

  and you thought that if you learned
the origin of your blood you would un-
derstand yourself

  perhaps my father was a weedy
little man with red hair he swore i
was none of his i didnt look like my
mothers side either pve never looked
kke anybody until i met you and kerrel
oddness becomes very wearing espe-
cially when you dont know why you
should be odd

  he added the villagers in cornwall
called me changeng i had the same
thought when i saw you

  so we are of one race michael could
you stay with me 

  youre not a woman youre a witch
ive never met a witeh before

  she laughed outright at that non-
sense witch changelnig-those are
wofjs fr fools and peasants

  who aie the vardda shairn

  she shook her head i told you-it is
a tribal name one that i want you to
forget

  she went on you said to kerrel that
you had come to brittany to trace down
	startling stories

your family

  yes i learned in cornwall that they
came from a place called keregnac

  he thought she started a little at that
name but she said nothing and he asked
do you know the town 

  it is not a town she answered slow-
ly only a tiny village lying on the
edge of a great moor yes i know
keregnac she picked up a bit of drift-
wood and began to draw idle patterns
in the sand i dont think you will learn
much there the village is very old and
now almost dead

  he started to speak but she went on
almost hurriedly dont go any farther
in your search michael it will bring
you nothing but regret i know the blood
you spring from i am telling you the
truth

  she turned to him go home go back
to america be content that you are
young and strong and yes-very hand-
some even if you do not resemble any-
one else i have done an ill thing i
should not have spoken to you tonight
kerrel was wise and his act was kind
now i ask you to forget me and all i
have said i am leaving st malo in the
morning

  no he caught her wrist and held
it oh no youve started this you
cant run away from it now

  but she said reasonably theres
no way you can stop me

  then ill follow his grip softened
shifted to the place where her strong
white neck curved so smoothly into a
perfect shoulder please shairn let
me see you again let me come with you
to your home

  she would not meet his eyes she
smiled a little and said that would be
a very long journey indeed

  brittany is not so large

  have i said that i live in brittany
she stood up suddenly i must gou
michael be angry with me if you will
but believe in what i say-forget me
forget brittany forget your family go
home and be content her eyes were
full of tears

  she left him then going swiftly
across the moonlit beach and he would

not run after her he stood where he
was upset and angered by her sudden
going

  after a while he thought of the things
she had said and the thing that kerrel
had said have i said that i live in
brittany

  where was home to the vardda
bent on the moonlit sand his moody
gaze was drawn to the patterns shairn
had traced there amidst the aimless
rambling lines a word stood out in clear
sharp letters-

 keregnac

         chapter ii
         the vardda

a hired car and driver took him
for an exorbitant price to kere-
gnac on the first day they had roads and
made excellent time on the second the
tiny fiat labored in agony along rutted
cart tracks the sea was far behind
them and the driver complained inces-
santly of the mad desires of americans
why should anyone wish to go to kere-
gnac a place that even the bretons had
forgotten 

  trehearne was in a savage mood
shairns cryptic warnings and her very
clear advice had only served to whip his
curiosity to fever pitch the devil him-
self could not have made him stop now
and he knew that the girl was a large
part of that determination

  she had done something to him she
had hit him where no one and nothing
had ever touched him before and she
had done it deliberately he was sure
of that she might be a lot of things
among them deceitful heartless and
dangerous but she was not feckless nor
lacking in intelligence

  then he remembered her tears and
began to wonder all over again

  the driver lost his way among the
ruts and the stony hamlets when he
begged directions the peasants regarded
trehearne in dour silence and could not
 be compelled to answer it was impossi-
 ble even to learn whether others had
 gone this way before them

   trehearne had forseen this possibil-
 ity he had had enough such difficulties
 in cornwall he had got a map and di-
 rections in st malo and he forced the
 unhappy driver on by dead reckoning
 it was night before they came wallow-
 ing into a muddy square half paved with
 ancient stones and saw the lights of half
 a dozen dwellings clustered around it

   go there to the largest house said
 trehearne ask if this is keregnac and
 tell the master well pay well for lodg-
 ing

   the driver himself in a thoroughly
 foul humor by now did as he was bid
 and in a few moments trehearne found
 himself in a three-room house of crum-
 bling stone the walls blackened with

smoke and age a meager fire burned
on the hearth and two home-made can-
dles furnished all the light

  it was enough to show trehearnes
face

  oddly enough the squat hard-handed
peasant who was master of the house
showed neither fear nor hatred nor
was he surprised

   a certain slyness crept into his sullen

do you have fo go voyaging
michael asked shairn
	startling stories

expression but that was all

  you shall have the best bed mon-
sieur he said in vile french and point-
ed to a gigantic carved lit-clos i have
also one good horse the others have
gone ahead into the landes you will
wish to overtake them

  trehearne tried to conceal his sud-
den excitement monsieur kerrel and
mademoiselle shairn

  the peasant shrugged you know
better than i what their names might be
i am not a curious man i enjoy good
health and am content

  he called sharply in the breton tongue
and a woman came to prepare food she
had a heavy stupid face she glanced
once sidelong at trehearne and after
that was careful neither to look at nor
speak to him as soon as the simple meal
was on the table she hid herself in the
adjoining room

  the ancient crone who sat knitting
by the fire was not so cowed as though
age placed her above necessity she kept
her bright little eyes fixed upon tre-
hearne with a mixture of hostility and
interest

  what are you thinking ma viellev
he asked her smiling

  she answered in french that was al-
most unintelligible to him i am think-
ing monsieur that keregnac is greatly
honored by the devil

  the man snarled at her in gaelic bid-
ding her be silent but trehearne shook
his head

  dont be afraid grandmere why do
you say that

  every other year he sends his sons
and daughters to us they eat our food
borrow our horses and pay us well oh
very well her white coif bobbed tre-
hearne laughed

  and do i appear like the devils son 
  you are the very breed

on impulse he went to her and said
once my family lived here their
name was cahusac

  cahusac eh eh keregnac has for-
gotten them the cahusacs that was
long and long ago they had an only
child a daughter who gave herself to

one of these handsome sons of the evil
one and    she looked at him wisely
but forgive me my old tongue has not
yet learned caution

  trehearne put silver in her lap and
thanked her and went outside he
walked the few paces to the end of the
muddy street and looked out upon a
moor that stretched still and desolate
under the stars

  into the landes the wastes shairn
had gone with kerrel why for what
purpose he could not guess any more
than he could guess the answers to all
the other riddles he knew better than
to ask his host he lighted a cigarette
and stood for a long time staring out
across the empty heath his eyes nar-
rowed and intense with thought

  he had traced his family back to
keregnac and he knew now the reason
for their leaving but the secret of his
birthright lay still farther on

  how much farther he did not dream

  at dawn he paid off his driver and
his host mounted the horse that was
ready for him and struck out into the
moor he had no idea what direction he
should take however the moor could
not be endless in extent and if he
searched long enough he was almost
bound to find what he was looking for
if kerrel and shairn and other sons
and daughters of the devil came into
the landes they must have shelter of
some kind

  but all that day he rode across stony
soil through gorse and bramble and
stunted trees without seeing a cottage
or a solitary sheep or even a distant
smoke to mark a human habitation
only here and there a lonely tor stood
like a druid sentinel against a lowering
sky

  it drew on to dusk the wind blew
and it began to rain a fine soaking driz-
zle that showed promise of going on all
night and the heath stretched on all
sides of him featureless without com-
fort or hope

  there was nothing to do but go on
he let the horse find its own way sitting
hunched in the saddle wet and wolfishly
hungry and at odds with the world
the starmen of llyrdis	

  his mood grew blacker as the light
failed the horse continued to plod on
through pitch darkness the land rolled
a good bit and trehearne knew from
the cant of the saddle when his mount
slid down into the hollow of a fold and
then scrambled out again up the other
sicle slipping and stumbling in the mud
and wet gorse

  from the crest of that low rise tre-
hearne caught a glimmer oflight ahead
and to the left

  he said aloud there is a cotters
hut and would not allow himself to
hope for anything else but he spurred
his horse on recklessly and his heart was
beating fast

  it seemed hours before he reached
that light

  he was close onto the place before he
could make out its size and shape in the
thick night then he reined in com-
pletely puzzled this was no cotters hut
nor was it a manor nor any normal sort
of dwelling he saw a broken shaft of
stone that had once been a squat crenel-
lated tower and around its foot a ruin
of walls and fallen outbuildings it was
obviously very old probably the strong-
hold of some medieval robber trehearne
guessed

  yet part of it was inhabited yellow
lamplight poured from the window em-
brasures of the keep and there were
horses in the courtyard sheltered under
prosaic canvas

  he dismounted and let his weary ani-
mal join its fellows then walking quiet-
ly over the sunken flags he approached
the tower

  he would have looked inside but the
embrasures were set several feet above
his head instead he stood for a time by
the door listening he carried a small
automatic-in his pocket and it felt good
under his hand there was something
wrong about all this-very wrong in-
deed

  the planks of the door were weath-
ered but he thought that they were new
in the last thirty years he could hear
the sound of voices beyond a number
of voices all raised in talk talk punctu-
ated by bursts of laughter

  as he listened there was a glassy
crash as though somgone had dropped
a bottle then further laughter in the
midst of which a man began to sing in
a deep strong voice the singer sounded
not particularly drunk but very happy
the song and the words to it were both
strange to trehearne it was a rousing
refrain and other voices joined in one
by one

  instead of reassuring him the jovial
uproar only made trehearnes nerves
creep more coldly down his back he
was sure that when he opened the door
he would find sfrairn and keprel among
the company what sort of folk were
they indeed to hold high wassail in a
ruined tower lost on this desolate moor

  the shrill old voice whispered in his
memory-every other year the devil
sends his sons and daughters

  he swore and laid his hand on the
great iron latch swinging the door wide
open

  the talking the laughter and the
song all died into the silence of astonish-
ment trehearne stood still in the door-
way and those within remained as they
were as though the opening of the door
had stiffened them into figures of wood

men and women a few less than a
score gathered in an archaic ob-
long room of musty stone their clothing
and the-chairs on which they sat did not
belong in that room nor in any room
trehearne had ever seen-but they be-
longed quite naturally to the people
there was a long table laid with food
and furnished with bottles of unfamiliar
shapes

  most of the faces were handsome a
few were plain and one was downright
ugly but all of them bore the same
racial stamp-the indefinable difterent-
ness from the rest of humanity that
subtly marked trehearne and kerrel
and the girl

  she was there shairn wearing a
looseshort tonic of some strange fabric
the color of flame belted over soft dark
trousers her belt was jewelled and her
sandal shoes had gulden bosses on the
straps she held a purple goblet full of
	startling

spicy wine and her eyes were fixed on
his and even so he could not read them

  she said without moving- or looking
away if you hurt him kerrel ill kill
you

  trehearne saw then that kerrel was
taking from his belt a thing that looked
like a narrow flashlight with a thick
prism where the lens should be he was
dressed like shairn-they all were men
and women both-except that his tunic
was iridescent silver open to the belt
to show his muscular chest

  kerrel said he has a gun

  he wont use it

  no said trehearne slowly i wont
use it his gaze had shifted from the
girl to kerrel he did not take his hand
 way from his pocket neither did ker-
rel put away the prism tube

  the ugly man stepped between them
lie had a merry slightly drunken face
from the tone of his voice trehearne
knew that it was he who had begun the
singing

  nobodys going to use anything he
said and thrust down kerrels arm
were all friends were all happy
were going home no quarrels between
two vardda now wait till you get to
llyrdis and kill each other there

  he glanced slyly at shairn and added
still at it eh my what fun we do
have with our pretty games

  oh shut up edri she snapped
michael how did you find us

  yes michael said kerrel mildly
do tell us how his eyes were not
mild nor the set of his mouth

  trehearne answered i went to ker-
egnac on business of my own he would
have gone on but the ugly man called
edri interrupted

  whats all this about he demanded
why shouldnt a vardda find his own 
he came and put his hand on tre-
hearnes shoulder i dont know you
my lad but what the devil  i cant know
everyone sit down have a drink did
you miss your ship last time we have
our full quota now but theres always
room

he thrust a glass of the aromatic wine
into trehearnes hand it went down

stories

like mellow fire and took some of the
chill out of his bones edri was still
talking but he had slipped now quite
naturally into that unknown tongue-
the language of the song the language
shairn had used when she mocked the
bretons at the festival

  there were others arounjj trehearne
now they were full of laughter and ex-
citement deluging him with questions
he could not understand someone took
his wet coat off him his glass was re-
filled

  shairn came up behind him and put
her two hands on his shoulders she
spoke to edri and the others their
chatter slackened they stared at tre-
hearne in amazement suddenly edri
flung back his head and roared

  i dont believe it he said in eng-
lish and peered closely at trehearne
youre having a joke together

  kerrel smiled what shairn says is
quite true somewhere far back this
man had a vardda ancestor thats his
only claim hes a remarkable atavism
no more

  well said edri well again he
peered at trehearne his ugly face puck-
ered comically his eyes however were
remarkably cool and shrewd he looks
like a vardda he said

  trehearne got up there was a kind
of anger in him now he looked at these
people who bore the name of vardda
he looked at their garments and their
furniture and the taste of their alien
wine was strong in his mouth a shiver
ran over him almost of fear

  he caught shairn by the arms rough-
ly and said who are you why are
you here in this place and where
are you going

  kerrel answered didnt she tell you
no-i see that she didnt quite dare do
that well theres no reason not to tell
you now

  he paused and trehearne felt a cold
foreboding at the hateful satisfaction
in kerrels eyes he knew that kerrel
was going to say something that would
hit him hard he suddenly didnt want
to hear it

  kerrel said we vardda arent of
the starmen of llyrdis	

your earth at all were waiting here
for a ship and were going home to
aldebaran-to the stars

chapter iii

the ship from outside

the words thundered in trehearnes
ears but they had no meaning-not
at first he let go of shairn who whis-
pered do you understand now why i
told you to forget the vardda

  edri thrust him into the chair again
sit down old man its a large mouth-
ful to swallow all at once here-wash
it down with this

  trehearne took the wine and drank it
home to aldebaran home to the
stars instinctively he appealed to edri
it isnt true he said it cant be
why not

  trehearnes throat was strangely
tight he stammered in his speech find-
ing it difficult to breathe star-flight
an alien race coming and going on
earth-and all this in secret no one
knows of it

  edri laughed oh billions of people
know about it from cygnus to hercules
we vardda trade openly between the
star-worlds of the galaxy for weve an
unbreakable monopoly on interstellar
flight

  he poured trehearnes glass full
again better let the idea trickle in
slowly with the wine

  trehearne drank mechanically but
the wine was tasteless now he could
not take his eyes from edris ugly sym-
pathetic face

  you mean youve conquered all those
stars and worlds

  edri snorted thats your earth
war-obsession talking war is not only
backward its damned unprofitable we
vardda arent conquerors were mer-
chant-adventurers

  he added patiently its this way-
there are hundreds of inhabited star-
worlds theyre most of them civilized

and proudly independent we vardda
rule our own world but no other

  but we have something the other
star-worlds dont have weve got a mo-
nopoly on interstellar travel for certain
reasons we vardda and we alone can
travel and trade between the galaxys
worlds-the richest monopoly of all
time

  but if you come and go like that
why not openly to earth

  edri shrugged you cant trade prof-
itably with worlds still in their war-
ridden phase such worlds we prefer to
visit secretly your earth is one of
them

  shairn broke in its true michael
we keep vardda agents here secretly
to gather from earth whatever of value
its civilization produces weve done
that for several centuries

  the blood hammered in trehearnes
temple we are waiting for a ship if
they brought those ships down in these
landes or in the great american desert
or in a hundred other of the waste places
of the globe who would know or see
them especially if they landed by night

  and the vardda themselves-the very
truth would protect them you might
look at a man and speculate whether he
came from some distant exotic land but
you would never suspect him of having
come from another star

  a woman began to giggle im
sorry she gasped but his face-its
so funny

  and so would yours be flashed
shairn her voice whispered swiftly in
trehearnes ear im sorry you came
michael i truly am but youve got to
hang on now

  he recoiled from the touch of her
fingers his mind was rocking from the
terrible agoraphobia of a man of earth
who had suddenly looked through an
opened window into the crash and roar
and glitter of all the galaxys stars

  woman not born of earth daughter
of the unimaginable deeps beyond the
world changeling lilith star-
witch   

  trehearnes head reeled and the fa-
miliar earth seemed to vanish behind a
	startling stories

fiery mist that dimmed his vision

  home to aldebaran

  he was aware of voices remote and
far away they were talking in that
unknown language kerrel was speaking
violently to edri shairn crying out the
others joining in and arguing edri
drank and did not answer his brows
drawn in a frown

  shairns clear voice overruled and
silenced the others she talked swiftly
her green eyes flashing with excitement
the others seemed to agree to her pro-
posal kerrel protested angrily but was
drowned out and edri reluctantly nod-
ded to shairn

  michael listen shairns voice came
urgently through the haze listen to
edri

with a great effort trehearne
drew himself back to reality he
looked up dazedly into edris ugly com-
passionate face edri said youre go-
ing with us

  trehearne stared at him without mov-
ing he did not answer he could not
for the moment he was beyond words
there was a sickness in him as though
the solid ground had dropped suddenly
from under him

  edri went on he looked uncomfort-
able almost guilty like a man who hates
the thing he is forced to do

  i wish you hadnt come he said
but you did and theres no help for it
im leader here and under orders earth
must have no knowledge of the vardda
you understand i cant leave you be-
hind

  trehearne began to understand he
looked at the faces of the vardda watch-
ing him doubtful and troubled only
shairns face he could not see he knew
they would use force if they had to

  jhe spoke and his voice sounded
hoarse and strange in his ears

  im going with you he repeated as
though he needed to assure himself of
the sense of those words going to
aldebaran

  im sorry edri said it seems pre-
ferable to killing you in cold blood as
kerrel wanted abruptly he swore in

his own tongue damn it i didnt ask
you to come here i said i was sorry
here have a drink

 trehearne sprang up he struck
aside the cup that edri held out to him
his violence was born of fear-fear as
deep as the abysses between the stars
he was no coward but no man could
have a thing like this flung suddenly in
his face and not recoil from it in a kind
of horror

  to aldebaran    to the stars   

  it had a diirerent sound now

  shairn was beside him her fingers
cutting into his wrist michael you
have to go i fought for you im count-
ing on you her eyes were hard and
bright they challenged him she whis-
pered dont show them youre afraid

 the man who stood by the door
opened it suddenly and went out leav-
ing it wide a curious silence fell on the
room it had an electric quality a thrill
that even trehearne could feel through
the daze of shock that numbed him
they waited and the time seemed end-
less he was very cold

  the man thrust his head back in and
shouted something a high excited cry
that was echoed from every throat

  michael the ship is coming do you
hear me shairns voice edged com-
manding ruthless he heard it

  walk with your head up michael
dont make them take you by force

  trehearnes face tightened some-
thing dark and cruel came into it he
shook her hand off roughly he turned
and edri was there holding out another
cup of wine he smiled an honest smile
friendly apologetic trehearne took the
cup

  it was strange he saw the others
laughing shouting pouring toward the
door he heard and felt and yet he was
like a dead man everything was re-
mote without reality the flimsy stuff of
dreams

  he drank the wine he knew that he
had done so because he put down the
cup again and it was empty he saw
edri watching him and again surprised
in that ugly face a look of pity then
he was walking out with the others
the starmen of llyrdis	

 he stood beside them in the windy
darkness of the moor it had ceased to
rain there was a wide rift in the
clouds the vardda were looking up-
ward toward it trehearne looked also
and saw the huge bulk of a great ship
dropping silently down from the stars

 softly soundless as a drift of the
night itself the star-ship settled down
over the heath there were no noisy
jets or clumsy bursts of flame to mark
its landing trehearne caught the faint
and subtle throbbing of motors different
from any he had heard before and some-
how that quiet song of power was more
frightening than thunder

 he watched alone in his strange
dream alone among all the men of
earth who dreamed for they would
wake and he knew that he would not

 the great sleek powerful stranger
came to rest on the moor bringing with
it a dark breath of mystery from the
outer suns its hull was scarred by the
atmosphere of unnamed worlds and its
ports had looked upon infinities where
the stars were swallowed up like clouds
of fireflies

  trehearne began to tremble an inner
shuddering of the soul

 the humming of the motors ceased

chapter iv

ordeal in space

the vardda began to run toward
the ship and trehearne was aware
that shairn was pulling him toward it

he saw that there were two men behind
him holding little prism tubes

  the ship was before him he had to
go into it he was afraid but fear would
do him no good it was like bailing out
you had to do it and you did it

  he was angry too but most of all he
was numb things had happened too
fast-too fast and too hugely

  he found himself shaking off shairns
grip for the second time he heard him-
self sayipg i can walk quite well by
myself he was surprised at the tone of
his voice it was sharp as a whiplash
and perfectly under control

  a lock-door had opened high in the
looming flank of the monster white
light blazed from it a folding metal
stair came down and then men and
women descended to join the vardda
waiting eagerly below there were greet-
ings talk laughter those who had been
exiles on earth for two years had much
to say to the newcomers who would re-
place them here

  a cargo hatch was open lower down
vardda crewmen were setting up a con-
veyor belt with the swiftness of long
practice

  things were being brought to it from
the tower what things trehearne
neither knew nor cared machinery clat-
tered softly

  he had reached the foot of the ladder

  he looked up the vast alien bulk of
the ship was above him it hung over
him like the end of the world and he
knew that it was just that he thought
of where that ship was going to take
him out into the darkness between the
stars out to unknown worlds a stran-

	startling stories

  he heard edri talking to the new-
comers they turned and stared at him
startled edri asked them earnestly
what do you think is he vardda or
isnt he

  a man shook his head youll soon
find out

  a woman looking soberly at tre-
hearne said its cruel to find out that
way but theres nothing else you can
do with him

 shairn said quickly come on
michael come aboard

 he wondered what the woman had
meant he remembered the look of pity
in edris eyes the uncomfortable
troubled look of the others

  the treads of the ladder rang hollow
under his feet

  a bell inside the great ship began to
shrill sharp and urgent the freight-
belt was already going up a leonine
young man clad in scarlet and black
with the tabs of rank on his shoulders
came running down and bawled a de-
mand that they hurry

  trehearne said shairn what did she
mean-its cruel to find out that way
nothing ill explain later come
on

  there was a great emptiness inside
him he was aware of the motions of
his body of the sounds and smells and
colors of the jostling of people behind
him on the ladder and yet none of it
was really happening it did not touch
him it was not part of him

  he trod upon a metal deck and passed
from the round lock-chamber into a
long transverse corridor faced in the
same dull metal he saw the scars of
time and hard use upon it now and
again through a bulkhead door he caught
a glimpse of a cabin or orderly room
men lived and worked in them they
had a disturbing look of reality

  there was a lounge and there were
chairs bolted to the deck and he was
sitting in one of the chairs

  the bells rang sharply

  shairn stooped over trehearne and
whispered kerrel is watching you he
wants to see you break

  they were all watching him all the

vardda in the rows of chairs their talk
had faded away and they were looking
at trehearne uncomfortably almost
guiltily it was as though something
were going to happen to him something
that they didnt want to see happen
edris ugly face was bleak and sad

  trehearne fixed his gaze on the one
unfriendly face on kerrels sullen eyes
they gave him a focus a definite point
of thought to cling to he said over
again to himself he wants to see me
break

  the bells rang again

  swift smooth and awesome as the
hand of god acceleration pressed down
upon him and this is it he thought

  muttering an all-but-silent thunder
the ship rushed upward into the sky
for the first time in history earthborn
ears listened to the banshee scream of
atmosphere past a cleaving hull

  the weight on trehearnes chest
seemed as heavy as all earth but he sup-
ported it and breathed and did not black
out his gaze did not waver from ker-
rels

  the wailing shriek rose to a crescendo
and died away

  earth was gone they had stepped
away from it even its sky was behind
them he was horribly afraid

  he waited for the pressure to ease
it did not there was a change now in
the pitch of the mo tor-vibration it
seemed to climb higher and higher in
a sort of demoniac frenzy

  shairn was bending forward watch-
ing him her face was tense without
color all the vardda were peering at
him now in a sort of climax of half-
fearful expectation what was it that
they were afraid was going to happen
to him

  the pressure grew and grew

  he labored to breathe something
happened to his vision the faces around
him began to waver and grow vague
to recede slowly into a reddish twilight

  and still the pressure grew

  fear became near-panic something
was happening to him-something un-
earthly and strange he was a flier a
test-pilot he had known pressure be-
the starmen of llyrdis	

fore he had taken all the gravs a
power-diving plane could bear and he
had never come close to blacking out
but this was different

  speed he thought light-years of
speed-a long way between stars

he felt it in the fibers the very
atoms of his being the incredible
accelerations of interstellar speed were
tearing at the separate cells of his flesh
riving them apart rending the tissues
of physical existence

  he knew that the vardda still watched
him half-fearfully this is what they
were afraid of theyre used to it but
im not im going to die

  he thought he heard a voice saying
fight michael fight

  shairn he muttered the word
never got beyond his throat because a
girl in a white dress had beckoned to
him he was going to die in an alien ship
between the stars

  kerrel settled back he began to
smile with almost the last of his sight
trehearne saw that smile kerrel knew
that he was going to die and he was
glad

  kerrel-shairn-the vardda-death
kerrel had known it all along they all
had that was why the others had looked
at him with that half-guilty troubled
pity they had known that he would die

  fierce resentment blazed up in him
like a sudden fire

  shairn with her lying tears she must
have known it would come to this when
she had drawn him to the tower yet
she had done it coolly gambling with his
life

  rage shook him some buried part of
his mind broke free and fury spurred
it on why must he die why should he
not live the vardda lived and their
blood ran in him

  anger-anger such as he had never
known he would not die under kerrels
smiling eyes he was filled suddenly
with a raging determination to survive
he began to fight the pressure

  he had nothing to fight with but will-
power it seemed a frail thing to pit
against the unthinkable powers of veloc-

ities such as the men of earth had never
dreamed possible reason told him that
but he was beyond reason he fought
and it was a strange inner struggle
without sound or motion-a blind battle
to regain control of his own flesh

  he fought against the unseen force
that sought to destroy the very cohesion
of his body cells anger flogged him on
and the instinctive will to live he set
his muscles and forced himself to
breathe and his flagging heart stumbled
steadied and began to beat more evenly

  he did not understand then what
happened he only knew that strength
came to him from somewhere a strength
he had never known he possessed it was
physical strength-not the sort that can
move great weights but a more subtle
kind a tensile force that strung his body
taut against the terrible vibrations of
speed and fought them back

  he did not understand not then but
he caught at that unguessed core of
strength within him and drew upon it
and it was simple so simple just a
matter of tensing the muscles in a cer-
tain way suddenly the ghastly sense of
his atoms falling apart was gone and
the battle he had thought impossible
was won it was easy and he was strong
-strong as any vardda

  it was then that he came near black-
ing out from sheer reaction and he
knew the victory had not been easy but
very hard the opening of that buried
well of strength had left him paradoxi-
cally as weak as a newborn lamb

  some deep ancestral wisdom told him
that he had been newly born in a way
that was still beyond his knowledge he
was a different man now he would
never be the same again

  he knew now that this was the im-
portant thing his body had been de-
signed for-this proud ability to race
between the stars

  shairns voice rang out he lives
he lives i told you he was true
vardda

  kerrels face had gone slack with
amazement trehearne drunk suddenly
with a heady exultation glanced at him
with fiercely mocking eyes the other
	startling stories

vardda had relaxed as though from a
sick taut apprehension they grinned
approvingly at trehearne

  but edri mopping his damp brow
said between his teeth by god shairn
if your tricks had made me an execu-
tioner if hed died  

  kerrel interrupted furiously per-
haps hell wish he had when we reach
llyrdis you know vardda law
trehearne heard and recognized the
menace in the angry threat but he paid
no attention

  he said softly shairn

  she came to him she was radiant
she was like nothing he had ever seen
before and he would never get her out
of his heart if he lived forever he got
up and set his hands on her shoulders
and he asked her shairn what is
meant by true vardda how do they
differ from other men

  she laughed you have just proved
your birthright michael dont you
know

  that inner strength he said slowly
the ability to withstand interstellar
speeds  she nodded she was still smil-
ing he went on i want to understand
this shairn do the vardda alone have
this ability

  edri had arisen he had the look of
a man who wishes to avoid an ugly
situation he said uneasily theres a
lot i want to show you trehearne come
on and ill explain about the vardda on
the way

  no

  shairn said its quite simple
michael controlled hereditary muta-
tion altering slightly the form and
structure of the body cells so that they
have enormous resistance to pressure
and vibration the other races of the
galaxy are tied by their human weak-
ness to their own solar systems-only
the vardda have the freedom of the
stars

  then said trehearne if the mu-
tation had not bred true in me i would
have died

  edri spoke again but trehearne did
not hear him he was smiling at shairn
a peculiar smile she began to draw

away from him but he held her and
asked are you glad i lived shairn
of course i am from the first min-
ute i saw you michael i was sure you
were one of us

  that was very clever of you and
you were so sure you werent afraid
to gamble on it-with my life

  she said uncertainly michael   
his hands moved swiftly from her
shoulders her throat was warm and
strong the veins beat hard against his
palms he could not see her clearly only
her great startled eyes

  edri snapped sit down kerrel he
drew a small prism tube from his belt
to trehearne he said i dont blame
you one damn bit but im afraid youll
have to stop it all the same

  a pale beam sprang out from the
prism it touched with exquisite care
against trehearnes temple he sighed
once and fell

        chapter v
        to aldebaran

trehearne looked up from the
bunk where he lay and asked how
long have i slept

  nearly twenty-four hours by earth
reckoning edri answered you need-
ed it the ships doctor gave you a shot
to make sure

  i seem to remember trehearne
said that you gave me a shot of some
kind yourself

  no hard feelings

  trehearne smiled briefly under the
circumstances-no he sat up they
were alone in a small neat cabin edri
was sprawled in a chair

  he leaned over and offered trehearne
a prosaic pack of american cigarettes
smoke 

  trehearne took one and lit it he sat
for some time in silence iemembering
he remembered most clearly kerrels
angry threat he asked what did ker-
rel mean by vardda law what will they
the starmen of llyrdis	

do with me when we reach liyrdis
edri looked worried i wish to
heaven i knew

 what can they do im a vardda
ive proved it

 ye-es edri agreed dubiously
actually youre all vardda a complete
atavism but legally-

  he began again you see the law
kerrel referred to is a prohibition
against admitting non-vardda strains
of any kind cross-breeding is forbidden
under penalty of death is the one un-
breakable law keeping the vardda
blood pure isnt just pride its an eco-
nomic necessity

  then that was true about the muta-
tion 

  edri nodded its the foundation up-
on which the vardda monopoly is built
no one else can fly at interstellar speeds
and live so we are the only species of
galactic man holding the stars in our
two hands

  a star-flight monopoly of the galaxy
built on a simple mutation in body-
cells

  yes said edri simple-but fun-
damental tissues having a certain cel-
lular structure possess a tensile strength
in their cell-walls that can withstand
incredible acceleration-pressure with-
out collapse youre lucky that the mu-
tation was a recessive that finally bred
true in you

 he paused then added somberly
some day ill tell you the story of
orthis who long ago found the secret
of the mutation a grand proud story
it is-with a most shameful ending
he seemed to brood upon some
thought of his own before continuing
so trehearne though actually vardda
youre legally not one it will be up to
the council i have no influence there
but shairn has some

  trehearne said bitterly much help
ill get from that damned witch who
was gambling with my life without tell-
ing me

  edri grinned i dont say you havent
reason for resentment still dont for-
get that if shairn hadnt proposed that
ordeal for you kerrel would have in-

sisted on killing you in cold blood

  he lifted the cover off a tray on a
small table by the bunk i brought you
some breakfast

  it occurred to trehearne that he had
not eaten for two days he got up look-
ing for his clothes they were gone but
others were laid across the foot of the
bunk-a tunic of dark green silk dark
trousers jewelled belt and sandals he
examined them doubtfully

  put them on said edri you cant
go about in those ridiculous tweeds

  trehearne dressed and sat down the
food was unfamiliar but palatable syn-
thetic he guessed he wolfed it down

  he tried not to think he knew that
if he thought of michael trehearne
bound out across the universe toward an
unknown fate his mind would crack
it could not accept that not yet

  edri said if youre finished come
with me ill show you something no-
body of your world has ever seen be-
fore

 trehearne got up he caught a
glimpse of himself in a reflecting sur-
face and was startled to see how changed
he was in the vardda dress

  they wert out into the long corridor
edri led the way forward now that
the ship was in free space and making
its unthinkable speed trehearne could
feel the deep inner vibration of power
in it-a sort of humming drone that
seemed to challenge the whole universe
to make it stop

  trehearne shivered with the joy of a
man who has handled power and is
privileged to see the ultimate he had
flown the fastest jets and they were
like childrens toys compared to this
mightiness

  he cried what is the motive power 
and the principle and how can you go
faster than light the limiting speed
contraction mass  

edri laughed one at a timet and
such simple little questions too it
took thousands of years to evolve a tech-
nology capable of answering them and
you want me to explain it all in a few
words well a few words is all i know
	startling stories

about it im a drinker by profession
jkt a scientist

  a really functional ship whether it
plies water air or space must get its
motive power by reacting against the
element it travels in and so right now
the big atomic-powered generators in
the stern are producing fifth-order rays
which react against the fabric of space
itself-and space not wishing to be
torn apart obligingly thrusts us for-
ward

  as to limiting speeds long ago the
vardda physicists believed absolutely
in them too-until they discovered fifth-
order rays they found then as your
scientists will find that the theoretical
absolutes you set up from limited knowl-
edge will prove illusory when your
knowledge expands i could explain all
that to you if i knew continuum-me-
chanics better than i do

  they had reached the forward end of
the corridor there was a narrow cir-
cular stairway leading upward edri
motioned trehearne to precede him

  he did so and emerged into a round
observation dome of immensely heavy
quartzite through it there was nothing
to be seen but utter darkness streaked
with creeping lines of light

  those are stars said edri or
rather the radiation patterns of stars
at our present velocity we are overtak-
ing the lines of luminous energy they
have left behind them star-tracks we
call them

  he closed a switch and the thick
quartzite became suffused with a pallid
milky glow edri consulted a master-
dial and made adjustments

  watch the dome he said its tri-
ple thickness of a special molecular
composition each plane laid at a differ-
ent oblique angle ive switched high-
frequency electronic current into hair-
line grids between the three planes and
all sorts of interesting and complicated
things are happening in the molecular
structure of the quartzite

  trehearne watched his heart was
beating hard

  behold said edri the light-im-
pulses of the star-tracks are caught

stepped up wrenched about and finally
held on the inner lens

  trehearne beheld and beholding for-
got edri and the ship and himself he
forgot almost to breathe

  edris voice came to him softly you
may see this often trehearne-but
never again for the first time
trehearne looked into the dark and
splendid loneliness of space the ship
seemed to fall away beneath him leav-
ing him suspended in the plunging gulfs
of infinity

  through the magic of that quartzite
dome he watched the great suns march
in flame and thunder on their way some
solitary hunters others joined together
in companies of stars he saw their cos-
mic pageant of life and death-the
young suns blazing with a blue-white
strength the golden suns the old red
suns the dead suns dark with funeral
ash

  he glimpsed the far-off island uni-
verses the coiling fires of the nebulae
the wondrous terrifying nations of the
milky way streaming along the rim of
creation and as he looked all thought
and feeling went from him leaving him
naked and dumb with awe

  some of the stars he recognized-
algol beating like a bloody heart of fire
the splintered glory of sirius to hie
left orion strode gigantic across infin-
ity girded with suns dead ahead tip-
ping the far-flung hyades aldebaran
burned in sullen splendor

  how long trehearne stood there won-
dering he had no idea he was lost a
man gone astray in a titans dream
edri was forced at last to drag him
bodily away and even then he hardly
knew where he was going or why

  he found himself in the corridor out-
side the lounge from within came the
sound of shairns voice raised in laugh-
ter and the easy murmur of talk

  edri stopped he said quietly youll
be spending much of your time with the
others and the sooner they get used to
you the better i want no trouble over
shairn is that understood 

  trehearne smiled ibs head was ring-
ing with stars hi vision dazzled by the
the starmen of llyrdis	

blaze of nebulae shairn had ceased to
matter very much he said so and edri
gave him a wry glance

  the longer you feel that way the
longer youll stay out of trouble he
paused and added perhaps you ought
to know why shairn was among us ob-
servers on earth she went with kerrel
hes mad over her and talked her into
it-though she soon was bored with
him and with earth too

  i think i understand why youre tell-
ing me edri said trehearne nodding
thanks

  he went on into the lounge shairn
was curled in a chair beside kerrel a
wine-glass in her hand she looked up
as trehearne came in her eyes chal-
lenging and half amused kerrels dark
face tightened and suddenly evex-yone
had stopped talking

  trehearne followed edri past them
without turning his head he was per-
fectly sincere in his indifference too full
of that outer immensity to care what a
woman thought or did he sat down
only vaguely aware of the curious
glances with which the vardda watched

  shairn lifted her glass mockingly to
edri a good beginning for a happy
voyage

  trehearne did not look up at her he
sat still thinking his own far thoughts
someone laughed and shairns green
eyes flashed angrily

  but neither her anger nor her mock-
ery could distract trehearne from the
wonder that had caught him from the
wild thrill of this plunge into infinity
and in the time that followed its grip
upon him strengthened

at first there were periods when he
felt that he was dreaming that the
ship and all within it would disappear
and he would waken but as his mind
readjusted itself shaking free from the
narrow horizons of earth ancestral
pride and ancestral longing began to
stir all the ill-fitting craggy corners of
his personality that had jarred so
harshly against the world he knew fell
into place perfectly now

 he was of one blood with these

vardda he knew it as he came to know
them better they had the same full-
blooded joy in living hard the same
storming recklessness and delight in
danger that he knew was in himself
they were galactic man-the men who
alone voyaged the interstellar gulfs
who alone strode between the stars

  the power the magnificence of this
voyaging between the suns no wonder
the little ships and little skies of earth
had seemed so futile this was his heri-
tage the freedom of the stars the long
long endless roads of outer space the
swift ships plying between the island
continents of suns the windless time-
less boundless gulf that washed the
shores of a galaxy

  trehearne stood for hours in the
observation dome he haunted the
bridge watching the intricate controls
the staggering complexities of astroga-
tion in the generator rooms he learned
by heart the pulse of the ship listening
to the silence of free flight after acceler-
ation was complete he learned much
and yet it was nothing and he was mad
for learning mad to hold under his own
hands one of these proud giants of the
stars

  and the vardda saw and understood
his hunger and warmed to him they
accepted him these gusty eager folk
whose pride was as great as their cos-
mic horizons he learned the vardda
tongue from edri and his head spun to
the tales he heard then from these mar-
iners of the galaxy of peril in far-off
clusters of suns of lonely dead stars
booming forever dark through darkness
with their frozen worlds of tricky
routes through nebulae of all the thrill
and danger that was life to them

  within trehearne there grew an iron
determination not to be robbed of hi
newfound birthright the threat of that
hung over him like a black cloud hav-
ing found them to be barred now from
the vardda ships the vardda life would
be worse than dying

  with that determination in mind he
began to question edri about vardda
law

  final decision on your case will lie
	startling stories

with the council edri told him and
theyll be dead against admitting you to
vardda status

  but damn it im one of you tre-
hearne said they cant deny that after
the ordeal i passed and why should one
more vardda make a difference

  edri shook his head to recognize
an earthborn man as a vardda no-it
might inspire vain hopes in all the
peoples of the galaxy who are bitterly
envious of our monopoly

  that was something trehearne hadnt
thought of he thought of it now i
suppose the non-vardda do envy your
power of interstellar flight

  would you like to be prisoned in
your own solar system and have stran-
gers carrying on all your commerce with
other stars edri countered

he added and theres more to it
than the economic problem youre
mad over this star-voyaging trehearne
ive watched you well do you think
other men cant feel the same way do
you think the young men of all those
star-worlds like to see the vardda star-
ships come and go and know that they
can never take that road

  i can see how they feel trehearne
said a wonder they havent found a
way to force the vardda to share the
secret of the mutation

  that secret was lost with orthis
we havent it to give if we wanted to
edri said gloomily then he added but
id better shut up or ill be accused of
orthist talk myself

  orthist said trehearne and edri
explained

  long ago when orthis discovered
the mutation he dreamed of giving it
to every race he couldnt see that that
would only lead to interstellar rivalries
and conflicts a few vardda still think
the way he did and so are called
orthists

  gut if the mutation secret is lost
how can they hope to change things
now 

  edri shrugged there are still fools
who dream of finding the secret again
they claim that orthis lost laboratory

ship which holds it might still be found
its only a useless dream but it makes
trouble and with all that in mind you
can see your problem with the council
altogether said trehearne it
looks like a grim prospect for me

  he got up

  you might as well know said edri
it wont be easy

  trehearne went out he climbed the
stair to the observation dome manipu-
lated the controls and stood there gaz-
ing at the red flare of aldebaran lost in
brooding thought

  after a time a hand touched his and
he turned his head slowly for his mind
was far away thinking it was edri he
saw instead the face of shairn

  she smiled do you still hate me
michael

  the light of the outer suns caught in
her eyes filling them with radiance
trehearne looked at her standing slim
and tall against infinity a luminous
creature crowned with stars and he
thought again that she was no woman
as he knew women

  he said slowly i dont know he
thought of how she had tricked and led
him how she had gambled so lightly
with his life why did you do it
shairn

  i think she said because i love
you or because i could love you

  or perhaps because you were only
curious

  perhaps she took his hands and
laid them on her white throat holding
them there pressing them in against
the beating veins you started this
once michael will you finish it now
her lips were curved and laughing
she was sure of herself sure of him
trehearnes eyes narrowed they were
suddenly hot and the starlight flickered
in them

  i ought to he whispered i ought
to   he called her a short cruel
name and caught her arm as it rose to
strike him and then her mouth was
under his

  dead ahead aldebaran watched them
from out of the darkness of space the
eye of a basilisk baleful and bright

chapter vi

judgment on llyrdis

the long arc of deceleration was
completed the great starship was
cruising now at planetary speed aldeb-
aran had grown from a remote point of
fire to a giant sun terrifyingly near at
hand the small companion was visible
only as a faint disc above the upper
limb its bluish light drowned out in the
flooding ruddy blaze of the larger star

  the vardda had crowded up into the
observation dome eager for the first
glimpse of home after two long years on
earth a heavy shield now covered the
dome to sunward and in its shadow the
returning exiles pressed and chattered

  trehearne stood among them listen-
ing to their excitement and feeling at a
loss in it their talk was suddenly the
talk of strangers full of names and
references that were meaningless to
him strident with a joy he could not
share

  they were coming home but he was
homeless-and before him loomed the
imagined faces of the vardda council
passing judgment

  shairn tugged at his sleeve there
she cried there it is michael llyr-
dis 

  he followed her pointing hand squint-
ing against the tawny glare of space
and saw a golden planet wheeling toward
them bright and beautiful with a trio
of circling moons

  he became as excited as the vardda
he forgot to worry he could only think
that presently he was going to tread the
soil of a strange world warmed by an
alien sun tasting the winds that blew
from unknown seas tensely now quiv-
ering with eagerness he watched with
the others and llyrdis grew

  it seemed about the size of earth as
the ship swept in upon it trehearne
could make out misty continents and the
shadow-forms of oceans wrapped in a
cloud-shot atmosphere that burned red-

gold in aldebarans light

  the ship plunged into it as into a bath
of fire down rushing down with a long
triumphant scream and in the lower air
the clouds rolled and whipped in golden
fury where the dark hull clove them

  they swept low over an ocean the
color of hammered brass and at length
trehearne saw ahead a low shore and
beyond it a rolling verdant plain girdled
with tall mountains and on that plain
the gleaming vastness of a city

  still dropping but slowly now in a
soundless glide the ship bore southward
of those lifting towers here for miles
the great docks ran cradling the giants
of the stars they were close enough
for trehearne to glimpse the ceaseless
swarming magnificently-ordered chaos
of men and machines in this central
focus of a commercial empire that em-
braced a galaxy the sheer size of it was
stunning

  edris voice spoke quietly beside
them ive just come from communi-
cations weve been ordered to land in
the government dock and you and i are
to present ourselves immediately to the
coordinator of the port

  old joris said shairn youre in
for a bad quarter of an hour edri ill
come with you of course

  well both come that was kerrel
he laid his hand with a light posses-
siveness on shairns arm ana smiled
over her head at trehearne trehearne
shrugged it crossed his mind that some
day if he were lucky he would kill
kerrel for nothing more than his way
of smiling

  the warning bells rang trehearne
went below with the others to await the
landing but his mouth was set and the
keen edge of wonder was all gone

  smoothly softly the great keel
touched down home again from the
edges of the universe

  trehearne rose there was much
hearty slapping of his shoulders many
assurances and offers of help he knew
they were sincere he bade them all
farewell with a jaunty carelessness that
was not sincere in the least and stepped
out onto the apron of adamantine con-
	startling stories

crete that edged the dock

  to his right some distance away was
a huge white building edri nodded and
trehearne began to walk toward it
shairn and kerrel were behind him

  the roar and clang and thunder of
the spaceport engulfed the building
dwarfed it so that it resembled a lonely
island in a monstrous sea the air was
heavy with the reek of oil and metal and
strange odors out of a thousand gaping
holds above in a golden sky the clouds
were like little nebulae of flame

  there was a bitter taste in tre-
hearnes mouth and the palms of his
hands were sweating as the white build-
ing took them in

  the halls seethed with activity
bronzed men in the black and scarlet
of the vardda ships hurrying clerks
and orderlies of a breed trehearne had
not before seen a clamor of voices and
the racing pulse of port administration
trehearne caught only a glimpse of it
a lift took them swiftly upward to the
highest level

  there was an office there bare and
spacious with window walls that looked
on all four sides across the spaceport
trehearne thought fleetingly that it was
almost like the bridge of a starship
pathetically shackled to the soil

  there were three men in the office

one was hardly more than a boy
he was in charge of what appeared
to be a recording device the second was
not mtieh older a brisk efficient young
man who stared at trehearne with frank
curiosity

  the third man dominated the room-
a grizzled heavy-shouldered giant who
had never been made to occupy an office
the walls cramped him even such walls
as these because they were bounded by
horizons his large scarred hands rested
uneasily on the polished table and his
eyes seemed better used to watching
stars than men

  he glared at them all impartially re-
serving one direct hard glance for tre-
hearne then he addressed himself to
edri i believe youre responsible for
bringing this man aboard the ship will

you please explain your action

  edri explained his voice was clipped
and firm he finished i felt-we all
did with the exception of kerrel-that
trehearne should be given a chance
he laid a particular emphasis on hi
final words he had a right to that
chance he proved himself a vardda
a mongrel a freak said jons im-
patiently an earthman you did him
no kindness to bring him here where he
doesnt belong and you shairn he
rounded on the girl i didnt ask you
to come but since youre here ill-
you wont tell me a thing joris
shairn interrupted him with the ease
born of many quarrels ill tell you
trehearne is as much a vardda as you
are and im going to see that-

  it was joris turn to interrupt i took
orders from your father when i flew his
ships but youre not the man he was
and i dont hold this job from you he
favored both shairn and edri with his
anger what the devil got into you
dont you know the law no non-vard-
da personnel under any circumstances
to board any craft designed for inter-
stellar flight 

  he went on to give them a dressing-
down that was a masterpiece edri
listened with a wooden countenance
shairn seemed to find it genuinely inter-
esting when he was finished she said
admiringly you havent forgotten how
to roar

  surprisingly joris laughed no he
said no more than youve learned man-
ners he swung around to the brisk
young man who sat at the end of the
table indicating trehearne wifh a jerk
of the head tell him whats to be done
with him

  the young man cleared his throat in
painfully stilted english he said to tre-
hearae you will remain in custody in
a suitable place until the council has
had time to decide what disposition  
trehearne moved forward to the table
he leaned over and looked at the young
man with a yellow gaze that stopped
the words in his mouth

  if youre thinking of going to earth
trehearne told him in good vardda
the starmen

you had better learn the language

  he straightened up he was angry
he was very angry and no longer inter-
ested in keeping his temper under con-
trol he faced joris and said the devil
with your custody you have no author-
ity to imprison me

  joris stared at him he shook his head
irritably as though he thought his ears
must be playing him tricks his bronzed
seamed jowls took on a tinge of red

  trehearne went on rather loudly
unless he is guilty of a crime no vard-
da may be detained by anyone against
his will have i committed any crime

  it took joris some time to recover his
voice when he did it had a sound of
thunder youre not a vardda

  no think a minute what is the
one distinguishing quality of a vardda
that marks him as different fiom all
other men

  all right ill answer that by some
freak or other you managed to survive
the flight but that doesnt change the
fact that youre an earthman born and
bred and therefore no vardda

op llyrdis	

  trehearnes eyes had acquired a hard
glitter then suppose he said that
you imprison me-an earthman who
has crossed the galaxy from sol to al-
debaran and lived thatll make quite an
uproar wont it all the non-vardda
peoples will be mightily interested so
will the orthist party i dont doubt
theyll spread the news all over the
galaxy-the vardda have admitted that
theyre not the only ones who can fly
interstellar space

 joris brows drew down into a
straight gray bar what do you know
about the orthist party

  enough to know they could make
trouble for you either im vardda or
im not-and if im not i could be
the start of a whole new movement
the first non-vardda to fly the stars the
first crack in the monopoly

  joris controlled himself with visible
effort he said you can be put away
so quickly and quietly that no one will
ever hear of you

away put away all the officers of the
ship put away all the passengers put
away all the crew thats a lot of people
to keep quiet

  shairn broke in on a triumphant note
yes joris how do you plan to silence
me 

  and me said edri he had begun
to hope

  joris looked from one to the other
and back again angry as an old bull but
for the moment baffled

kerrel said contemptuously
orthists that should be enough
to show you joris the man is trying
to blackmail you with the threat of
treason

  yes said trehearne i am his
voice was suddenly quiet there was an
iron quality about it and about the set
of his jaw he ignored kerrel he was
speaking straight to joris to the man

  when i made that flight and lived
i won my right to the freedom of the
stars do you understand that i won
my right to fly deep space between the
suns and ill use any weapons i can get
toy hands on against the man who tries
to keep me from it

  he was silent then standing motion-
less looking into the old mans eyes
and joris was silent also kerrel laughed
but no one heard him

  by god said joris slowly i take
it back there cant be any mongrel
blood in you only a vardda could have
that kind of insolence

  he swung about and began to pace
up and down behind the table the
young man gaped the boy by the re-
corder gnawed his thumb and shivered
in an ecstasy of excitement kerrel came
forward intent on saying something
shairn gave him such a murderous look
of warning that he hesitated and in that
moment joris made up his mind

  he went to the recorder took out the
spool and broke it he gathered the slack
of the boys tunic into one hand with
the other he reached out and collared
the young man he brought them close
together in front of him and glared
down into their faces

  if one word of what youve heard
here goes beyond this office he said
distinctly you will regret it under-
stand

  they understood and said so joris
nodded now get out

  they left the boy reluctantly the
young man with his faith in the eternal
rightness of things shattered forever

  joris said ill talk to trehearne
now

  kerrel could contain his rage no
longer what kind of a fool are you
joris he demanded  freedom of the
stars be damned cant you see hes
playing with you

  if he is answered joris grimly
hell pay for it meanwhile ill be the
judge of my wisdom dismissed
come on said shairn and took ker-
rels arm they went out together edri
paused in the doorway and gave tre-
hearne a parting grin that meant good
luck then he too was gone

  the old spaceman and the younger
man of earth stood alone in the sweep
of light from the windows from the
eastern quadrant of the port trehearne
saw a great ship rise and clear away
outbound for distant suns

  joris tilted his head come here
trehearne obeyed joris eyes were
harsh and keen as an old eagles weigh-
ing studying judging trehearne stood
erect and waited he said nothing there
was nothing more to say

  vardda blood joris muttered to
himself unmistakable and he wants
to fly the stars he asked abruptly
were you a foundling

no said trehearne and then slow-
ly but i might just as well have been
joris turned away scowling thought-
fully his head and shoulders massive
against the background of burning sky
how old are you

  thirty-three

  i have an idea whether it will work
or not i dont know the council sits
again in five days at which time i will
make my report on you-and since im
taking you on faith and my judgment
youll have to take me the same way
ill do my beet meanwhile for the sake
the starmen of llyrdis	

of my neck as well as yours youll have
to go where i tell you and stay there
is that clear

  yes

  good and trehearne   

  yes

  if i succeed with the council-you
will fly the stars

  it was as much a threat as a promise
for the first time trehearne smiled

  thirty minutes later after a journey
in an underground tubecar that left him
in complete ignorance of his where-
abouts trehearne was conducted into
a square neat cubicle comfortable in all
respects but none the less a prison cell
the lock of the door clicked behind him
and he was alone

  there were no windows he did not
even know whether he was above or
below ground there was neither day
nor night nor time

  he paced the narrow floor and ate the
food brought to him by a silent dark-
faced jailor and tried to sleep he
smoked the last of his hoarded cigarettes
and thought of earth and the distances
between the suns he hoped and hope
became gradually a grim despair

  no one came shairn had forgotten
him edris friendship had been a feeble
thing the trap that joris had set for
him became more obvious with each
passing hour he hated them all he
raged and waited and remembered the
old mans words-you can be put away
so quickly and quietly that no one will
ever hear of you

  this was his landing on llyrdis the
fruit of his journey across the star-shot
universe this was the end of his dream

  he ceased to rage he only waited
and wondered why the messenger of
death was so long in coming

 there came a time when he awoke
sharply from uneasy sleep to hear the
low click of the lock and a soft slurred
step on the padded floor coming toward
him

  he sprang up reaching out to grap-
ple with his killer and saw that it was
shairn she cried out michael and
he stopped uncertain and her words
came to him with a sound of unx-eality

like the voices heard through fever

  its all over michael-and youre
free

chapter vii

in the silver tower

an hour had gone by and he still
could not quite believe it

  he had left the cell behind him and
the five eternal days of waiting he
stood on a terrace high above the city
it was night and the burning moons
were golden in the sky the wind from
the sea had the clean sting of wins
around him were the tall fantastic tow-
ers bathed in light far below the shin-
ing web of streets was a pattern of
sensual beauty many-colored sounding
alive

  shairn said softly look at it
michael its all yours youre a vardda
now by order and decree

  vardda he whispered to himself
vardda lord of the starways his hands
were tight on the terrace rail and his
gaze was far away

  i had something to do with it
michael arent you going to thank me
he turned she had put on a flowing
thing of white cunningly draped and
spangled over with a diamond frost so
that her bosom and shoulders seemed to
rise from sea-foam and there were
strange jewels caught in the dark mass-
es of her hair he started to speak and
then forgot the words there were
better ways of thanking her

  he had not nearly finished when
sounds from inside the apartment-it
was edris-announced the arrival of
joris and shairn pulled away from him
laughing

  come now and hear how the miracle
was done but youll have to find a differ-
ent way of thanking joris

  joris greeted trehearne with a de-
mand to know what he had been think-
ing those five days in- the cell trehearne
grinned i wont tell you since none of
		startling stories

it was true

  edri said weve told trehearne
nothing he found glasses and poured
wine joris settled heavily into a chair
full of an honest pride in his own clever-
ness beaming with it

  it took a lot of juggling he said
and more than a little downright for-
gery-but it worked a full record of
all voyages is kept at port administra-
tion i went back between thirty and
forty years and managed to supply you
with a pretty good background

  he leaned forward get this into
your head trehearne and keep it there
you were born on earth thirty-three
years ago of vardda parents then sta-
tioned on that planet your mother died
in childbirth and your father was forced
to abandon you since even a vardda
infant cannot endure interstellar flight
he handed trehearne a slip of paper
here are the names of your parents
memorize them your father has since
been killed in a wreck off orion nebula
and you have no brothers or sisters
incidentally you have no inheritance
either for your fathers estate was
divided according to law upon his
death

  he added from now on this is your
only history dont forget it

  he paused to empty his glass and
shairn took up the story

  joris and i persuaded the council-
lors not to have you appear for ques-
tioning michael the records and your
vardda characteristics were sufficiently
convincing we pointed out to them that
the less talk there was about it all the
better they passed their resolution in
less than thirty minutes then followed
it by another to tighten the laws against
vardda children being born on any
world but llyrdis

  she burst into laughter and tre-
hearne held out his hand to joris he
said one word thanks

  joris grip was hard and horny and
his eyes were sharp perhaps i was a
fool to do this for you well see in the
meantime youve got to make a living
we vardda count our wealth in ships-
and until you own one youll have to

work for someone else do you still want
to fly the stars 

  he saw the look on trehearnes face
and smiled i need a supercargo on my
ship saarga outbound in two weeks for
trade in the hercules cluster officers
and crew fly on shares and its a rich
voyage even a supercargo should do
well

  edri said i ought to warn you tre-
hearne-the hercules run is one of the
toughest in the galaxy

  thats why it pays so well said
joris well

 before trehearne could answer
shairn laid her hand lazily on his shoul-
der and remarked nonsense joris he
doesnt have to take on anything like
that i can find a better opening in my
fleet and he wont starve until i do
trehearnes face had tightened he
said you never told me much about
yourself shairn i gather youre quite
well off

  oh quite as joris says our wealth
is in ships he owns two i own thirty
my father built one of the richest fleets
on the trade lanes and i was fortunate
enough to be his only heir she laughed
and shook her jewelled head

  the devil with all talk of business
anyway this is a night for celebration
she pulled him to his feet come on
michael well show you the city

  in a minute he told her curtly
joris was looking at him with an odd
expression

  trehearne went over to him and said
when shall i report to the saarga
edri leaned over shairnes should
and whispered audibly i think youve
got our michael angry

  joris looked at shairn and roared
missed your guess didnt you he got
up all right trehearne lets see
about that celebration

  they went but for the next hour or
so shairn was inclined to be sulky the
more so because trehearne seemed to
have forgotten her existence

resplendent in black and silver
supplied for him out of edris
wardrobe free accepted and with a
the starmen of llyrdis	

future ahead trehearne walked the
streets of the city drunk with color and
sound and movement

  the city surged magnificently crowd-
ed thriving beautiful devoid of pov-
erty drenched in the wealth and inven-
tiveness of a thousand far-flung cultures
mecca for all the peoples of aldebarans
seven inhabited planets

  the little ships that tramped the nar-
row planetary roads set down beside the
scornful giants of the star-trails and
poured into the metropolis a never-end-
ing tide of visitors come to touch the
fringes of a glory they could never touch
themselves-to revel in alien pleasures
and barter for the gems and spices and
spider-woven silks of worlds that they
would never see

  most of them were human or nearly
o their skins of a variety of tints their
costumes outlandish or sober according
to their native custom some were not
human at all

  see those black-skinned hawk-nosed
chaps with the bronze wings edris
hand guided trehearnes wondering
gaze theyre from suumis and the
three silvery ones over there with the
bright crests and the crimson robes-
theyre the dominant race on mirris and
proud as lucifer for all theyve got
scales instead of skin that little blue
fellow is a merchant-prince from zaard
the outermost planet see his diamond
caste-mark 

  trehearne saw he saw them all and
his head swam with it the pulse and
rush of the city the kaleidoscopic multi-
tudes the companies of lordly vardda
like peacocks in their jewels and bril-
liant tunics the babel of outworld
tongues the drifting sound of music

  from place to place the four of them
wandered drinking the dark wine of
antares the pungent snow-white brew
of fomalhaut endless wines of many
colors from the worlds of many stars
shairn forgot to sulk to trehearne
she seemed to float in moonlight and
laughter bewitching unattainable

  his head commenced to swim in ear-
nest

  faces human half-human unhuman

beautiful grotesque ludicrous carni-
val masks reeling dancing vardda
women lovely as sin dressed in a thou-
sand fashions smiling with red mouths
music throbbing passionate soft min-
gling with the smell of wine and per-
fume and the sharp sea wind

  dancing-girls with emerald skins
outlandish beasts that capered with an
eerie cleverness a spinning whirl of
pleasure-palaces infinitely strange ter-
races gardens parks and squares name-
less trees blowing under the triple
moons joris flushed and jovial a grey-
polled ox on holiday edri   

sobriety was not habitual with
edri but trehearne had never seen
him drunk he was drunk tonight and
as joris and trehearne grew gayer he
grew steadily more solemn and with-
drawn he sat drinking silently now his
eyes gazing into inner distances a
brooding look on his ugly face

  they were in a place of trees and
crystal columns with bowers drowned
in bloom and the open sky above when
kerrel joined the party he sat down
between shairn and joris erect hand-
some he did not touch the wine well
trehearne he said welcome to the
vardda race

  thanks and then deliberately
shairn moved and laid her head against
trehearnes shoulder

  do you have to go voyaging
michael her lap was full of the great
pale moonflowers and her hands toyed
with the musky blossoms something
wicked and demure was in her eyes

joris poured ruby liquor into edri
goblet here man you look too sober
edri pushed the goblet away no
im going home how about the rest
of you 

  but ive just come said kerrel
easily he turned to shairn did you
her about arrin

  what about him

  it seems hes one of the orthit lead-
ers they caught him today odd thing
though-they couldnt find any of his
papers very casually he added to
edri a friend of yours isnt he
	startling stories

  i know him

  oh come now youve known him
for years

  edri said nastily ive known you for
a long time too dont cat-and-mouse
with me kerrel if you have something
to say say it

  kerrel shrugged i was only think-
ing that a man can have too many un-
fortunate friendships it was perfectly
obvious that he included trehearne
among the undesirables

  your field is comparative technol-
ogy edri said i understand youre
quite good at it stick to it im leaving
he walked away staggering a little
trehearne watched the solitary figure
moving down an avenue of trees
splashed with shadows and golden light
he hesitated then got to his feet and
followed

  edri stopped when he felt trehearnes
hand touch him he looked at him curi-
ously as though he had never seen him
before

  whats wrong edri

  nothing a man is going to be pun-
ished but thats not wrong its right
that he should be punished he is an
orthist a traitor

  trehearne understood now your
friend arrin

  yes-my friend but he deserves
punishment for being an orthist and
do you know how they punish such
traitors with exile-bitter lifelong
exile on the lonely world of a lonely
star they are never allowed to fly space
again to a vardda thats worse than
death

trehearne felt a trifle sick he
who had just won the right to star-
flight could realize the crushing enor-
mity of such a sentence

  i didnt know they did that to
orthlsts

  oh yes not all of them not the
talkers xn the salons who only play at it
but the men who work-oh yes

  edri went on he was very drunk and
npw that he had started it seemed that
hi could not stop he was not talking to
trehearne but to himself to the wind

and the casual moons and a world that
had turned bitter around him

  arx-in worked he searched the rec-
ords the forbidden files until they
caught him he never found what he
was looking for but he might have-a
little more time and he might have

  he looked up into the sky the empty
sky that stretched to the rim of the
galaxy

  somewhere out there orthis sits in
his ship and waits-waits to be found
again but where thats it the ques-
tion that no one has answered in a thou-
sand years where

  he turned aside and was abruptly
violently sick trehearne waited

  after awhile edri said curious tha
things a man will say when hes drunk
i dont know trehearne said i
didnt hear anything

  edri managed a grin im all right
now im going on home

  when trehearne returned to the
others shairn complained sweetly you
were gone so long michael was edri
sick

  yes-very but hes all right now
he went home

  i think said shairn with a dainty
yawn that ill go home too come
along michael

  kerrel turned a dull red and there
was sudden murder in his eyes he said
thickly am i to understand-

  you are to understand anything you
wish shairn smiled

  joris came out of his vinous fog and
enquired hopefully is there going to
be a fight

  trehearne asked kerrel is there
they looked into each others eyes
the direct intimate look of hate then
kerrel said softly no not now its
only a matter of time but not now not
tonight

  he had mastered himself when he
turned to shairn i trust youll find
your new toy amusing

  i shall-until he begins to act as
though he owns me her smile became
more beautiful more sweet tell me
kerrel now that its over-did you love
me or my thirty ships 
the starmen of llyrdis	

  the angry flush went out of kerrels
face leaving it deathly white he stood
for one long moment then turned with-
out a word and stalked away his heels
left small sharp scars in the turf

  shairn lifted one exquisite shoulder
hes tiresome oh well come along
michael

  she took his hand and he went with
her joris booming laughter followed
them down the avenue of trees

  trehearne realized only later just
how wine-flushed he was he had no
clear memory of how they reached the
car-an ultra-streamlined sublimation
of a car powered by humming genera-
tors-nor of the drive out from the city
he was suddenly aware of a broad road
running along the coast of the golden
sea on one hand dark mountains on the
other shairn was at the controls he
hoped she was more sober than he she
was going very fast the sea wind bat-
tered at them wild and cold

  shairn stopped the car this is my
home michael my family has lived here
for hundreds of years-here in the sil-
ver tower

  she led him inside he tried to see it
all clearly but things tended to melt and
run t o g e t h e r-tapestries carvings
colors the loot of many worlds shairn
went before him floating a white foam-
wraith

  michael

  yes

  they were in a long gallery above
the sea the moonlight lay in great
angled blocks along the floor

  youre a vardda now-but youre in
greater danger than ever kerrel will
kill you if he can

  yes said trehearne if he can
dont underestimate him michael
he can be very deadly

  he drew her to him not tenderly
you took good care to make him so
you wanted kerrel and me to battle it to
the death right there didnt you 

  she laughed it would have been ex-
citing

  listen to me shairn the next time
you try to make trouble youll get it-
from me

  now youre being masterful and no
man is my master

  he took her face between his two
hands and looked down into it his
thumbs bit cruelly into her white cheeks

  i think youre going to be sorry you
ever met me shairn he whispered

  two weeks later dressed in the black
and scarlet of the vardda spacemen
trehearne left shairn for the starship
saarga outbound for hercules

chapter viii
under the cluster suns

the saarga was not like the ship
that nad brought trehearne from
earth she was older and shabbier with
enormous capacity for cargo and no
space at all for passengers officers and
crew were cramped in quarters func-
tionally reduced to the absolute mini-
mum and there were no such luxuries as
lounges and observation domes

  but to trehearne she was a thing of
wondrous beauty every dent and scar
on her unlovely bulkheads recorded a
voyage to a nameless sun the crammed
and odorous vaults of her belly were
storehouses of exotic riches the fruits
of unimagined worlds and he was part
of her he was no longer merely a hun-
gry observer he belonged

  he worshipped her

  his shipmates discussed trehearnes
curious history-official version-with
great interest asked him questions
about earth then forgot it the officers
treated him with the affable contempt
of the veteran for the amateur liked
him and were patient with his feverish
insistence on learning to be a starman
there was little else to do on the long
haul out and they taught him much

  they showed him the purring metal
giants that drove the ship the mighty
generators powered by almost auto-
matic atomic turbines they taught him
how to read-the radar-screen that func-
tioned not by slow electro-magnetic
	startling stories

waves but by rays incomprehensible to
him which were far faster than light
-another flat contradiction of the
earth theoreticians

  he listened rn communications to
vardda ships talking across the galaxy
in thin ghostly converse by the same
super-swift rays he was allowed-and
that was like realizing an impossible
dream-to hold the controls of the
saarga in his hands as it raced through
infinity

  trehearne became especially friendly
with yann the second officer a cheer-
ful young rakehell who had made nine
voyages into the cluster and had once
been stranded for the equivalent of an
earth year on one of its wildest worlds
pinch-hitting for a vardda factor who
had died

  wait until we hit that system he
told trehearne ill show you things
you never dreamed of you want to see
real barbarism they have it there

  yann had made a brace of fortunes
and gambled them away he still clung
firmly to the belief that some day he
would have a ship of his own

  this trip will do it he would say
and laugh and build vast empires that
stretched across the star-clouds of the
milky way

  he was good company he was very
helpful to trehearne instructing him
in the diverse arts of starmanship they
got on well

  the great cluster of hercules grew
from a patch of hazy brilliance lost in
the blaze and crash and thunder of the
universe to a monstrous star-swarm
blinding even through a darkened port
-a swirling hive of suns white red
yellow peacock blue and vivid green
booming across the eternal night of
space with the rush and roar of a cos-
mic avalanche hurtling onward toward
some unknown destination guided by
the evil blinking eyes of the cepheid
variables

  the saarga plunged in among the
edges of the swarm and trehearne be-
gan to discover why edri had warned
him about the hercules run

  all the globular clusters are bad

yann told him omega centauri-
theres another one to break a starmans
heart a strong ship a strong captain
and no imagination-thats what it
takes for a voyage like this

  trehearne was introduced to gravity
tides and for the first time in his life
he knew what real fear was

  the generators throbbed incessantly
the saarga groaned and shrieked in all
her metal bones moving in erratic
bursts of speed and sudden brakings
pitching and swerving as she felt her
way in through shoals of suns fighting
the complex changing gravitational
fields trehearne got the feeling that he
was trapped inside an iron football be-
ing battered back and forth between
the stars

  yann grinned it gets worse as you
go farther in

  it did

  trehearne felt that it was impossible
for any ship to live in those mighty
cross-currents of gravitation as the suns
thickened like swarming bees but the
saarga went doggedly on her way and
after a while trehearne got used to her
complaints and violent pitchings

  they stopped first at the single lone-
ly world of a waning star on the fringe
of the cluster-a shadowy place flood-
ed with the distant glories of other suns
but cold and barren and dying the
saarga discharged food and ores took
in payment gems of royal purple mined
out of the grey rock by little men with
sorrowful eyes

  the little men looked at the great
ship and the men who flew in her then
at the flaming suns that were out of
reach they made their bargain silently
and went away trehearne was glad
when they left that world

  they visited the eerie planet of a
variable star where there was no life
at all but a creeping fungus valuable
in the preparation of a medicinal drug
trehearne clad in insulating armor
against the radiation of that evil sun
went with his shipmates to reap the
ugly harvest sank up to his knees in
spongy dust

  they traded with scaly humanoids
the starmen of llyrdis

under the glare of a blue-white sun
they stripped the worlds of a red giant
leaving gilded trinkets in exchange for
rare radioactive minerals they dealt
with life-forms so degraded that there
was no semblance of humanity while
the vardda stood with shock-cannon
ready to guard the ship while the bar-
tering went on

  and they touched at systems that had
a high degree of civilization where for
the first time trehearne saw the vardda
factories-vast walled compounds held
under treaty crammed with ware-
houses in which were gathered the sal-
able goods of a family of planets

  that he learned was the universal
system wherever trade was openly and
regularly carried on-the walled com-
pound and separate landing-field pre-
sided over by a vardda factor an island
fragment of llyrdis preserved intact
amid an alien culture

  trehearne became accustomed to the
open envy of the non-vardda races he
no longer thought of it except to notice
its variation according to cultures-the
aboriginals who mixed with it a wor-
shipful fear of the vardda star-
lords the barbarians who would have
killed them except that they were greedy
for the luxuries of trade the more
civilized folk who treated them with
cold respefet and ate out their hearts
with envious longing

  he got used to the eternal never-
changing question asked on every world
by the old and the young and the large-
eyed children-what is it like to fly
among the stars

by the time they reached the system
of the green star he was a thorough
vardda

  yann was full of excitement this
is the system i told you about tre-
hearne-the one where i was factor so
long i got to know the natives like a
brother he laughed and clapped tre-
hearne on the shoulder we make a
long stop here and ill see to it that it
isnt dull

  the saarga set down on a world of
emerald heat besides the starship the
landing-field contained half a dozen bat-
tered interplanetary craft brought out
piecemeal by the vardda and operated
by them between the wild planets of the
system the great stockaded factory
was one of the largest trehearne had
seen and the strangest

  the logs that formed the stockade
and made the walls of the warehouses
were of crystal cut from the crystalline
forests that covered much of the land
trehearne thought of them as trees and
forests simply because they had stems
and branches but they were inorganic
the glittering proliferation of subli-
mated alien chemicals

  they glowed and flashed under the
fierce green sun showing glints of
weird color where a prism formation
broke the light and also in their shin-
ing branches they netted the many-
colored rays of the brighter stars that
burned even in the daylight sky

  there was a town beyond the factory
it too was built of the crystal logs over
foundations of black rock sunk in the

turn pvge

a ten-thousand-year invasion of earth

it began when humanity wot young and the druids ruled what is now westerr
europe

 it has continued inexorably ever since surviving setbacks and disaster no human
 invaders could take

 it is winning its final victory all around us today with only a tew men and womer
 even aware that an enemy exists

ooze thick vines clambered every-
where bearing bulbous fruit under-
growth green almost to blackness stood
rank between the trees there was a
smell of fragrant rottenness cloying
sweet

 trehearne moved and sweated
through a bath of molten jade it was
a large world and heavy the gravity
dragged at him the letters of the
freight lists swam under his eyes when
he was finished at last with his job he
was glad enough to follow yann

  wine cooled in deep wells said
yann and smacked his lips make a
new man of you

  a hell of a world said trehearne

  you should see the others of this
system this is the pick of the lot

  they walked through the outer com-
pound a sort of caravanserai crowded
with folk from the other planets
brought in for the trading cold-blooded
creatures with crimson eyes ophidian
princes of the inner worlds wrapped
in golden mantles against the chill slim
furred kings of the outer planets capped
and girdled with precious stones still
and panting in the heat these and
others watched the two tall vardda
thinking their own thoughts

  they passed through the gate out of
the factory wading in soggy mud the
sun was setting in a welter of lurid
green tinged with peacock hues tre-
hearne looked at the town ahead the
straggling lanes the crystal huts that
crouched in sordid beauty the encir-
cling forest of ungodly trees doubt
assailed him

  perhaps we should stay in the fac-
tory therell be plenty of wine and
more comfort

  yann cursed him good-naturedly i
told you i know these people better than
i know my own children come on tre-
hearne theres nothing to do in the fac-
tory dont you want a good time ive
got friends in the town youll like
them

  trehearne glanced back at the fac-
tory it was not inspiring he shrugged
he was beginning to feel the long con-
finement of the voyage the tensions and

the haste of trade it would be good to
cut loose for once to see something of
life outside the compounds to get a
change from the same faces it was
against orders but   

  he made sure of the prismed shock-
tube in his belt and followed yann

  night came the glorious sky of the
cluster crashed down on them sown
to bursting with stars as bright as
moons the crystal trees took on opaline
fires the hut walls glittered

  around the two vardda there gath-
ered a crowd of sloe-eyed children silent
and solemn with hides of dusky green
women watched them from the door-
ways human enough and pretty enough
too the younger ones sleek and olive
colored wearing bright silks from llyr-
dis around their hips and baubles in
their hair

  trehearne asked yann a question
that had puzzled him how is it that
there are humans or humanoids on so
many worlds earth scientists had the
idea that the human form was likely to
be unique

  oh the vardda biologists have been
busy with that for centuries etheyve
compared data from all over the galaxy
and worked out a theory that at some
remote time great clouds of spores were
deliberately released into space-you
know little life-seeds with a basic ten-
dency to develop toward the human
form or something like it what long-
dead civilization tried to perpetuate the
human form by releasing the spores
well never know

  he laughed anyway who cares
here they are and mostly human and i
take them as they come

he chattered happily as they went
along the winding lanes telling of
his multifarious sins and adventurings
and the clever ways in which he had
cheated the factory the hostile curious
eyes of the women followed them and
now and again a man spat expressively
into the mud behind them

  they came at last to a hut on the out-
skirts of the town beside it were
chained four pairs of beasts the size of
the starmen of llyrdis	

harriers milk-white with dark muzzles
and feet their undulating bodies built
light and long for speed they made
shrill barking sounds and leaped at the
strangers showing hungry fangs tre-
hearne thought they looked like gigantic
weasels-and quite as friendly

 hounds said yann kurat is a
hunter i had a private arrangement
with him for skins he winked hugely
and lifted up his voice shouting in the
native tongue an obvious demand for
kurat to come out and welcome his
brother

 a lean hard-muscled man emerged
he wore a loin-cloth of brilliant blue
silk not very clean and a necklet of
hammered metal he greeted yann with
glad cries trehearne smiled inwardly
they were two of a kind the vardda
and the hunter a brace of happy scoun-
drels

 kurat welcomed him in the lingua
franca of the factory towns a brother
of yann it seemed was his brother
also he swept trehearne before him
into the hut

  there was a numerous family inside
a very old man and woman sat in a
corner doing nothing babes and chil-
dren cluttered the floor kurats hulk-
ing wife waded imperturbably among
them a handsome younger woman
brought in a great sweating jug and
poured from it into trehearnes cup

  the wine was cold and bitter tre-
hearne draining it began to forget the
heat and his weariness then as he
looked up into the young womans face
he was startled by the hatred in her
watching eyes

  he said suddenly why do you hate
us so

  she laughed metallically is there
any world where the vardda are loved 

  because we are able to fly the stars
and you arent

  because we too could have had the
freedom of the stars and you vardda
kept us from it

  trehearne stared at her disconcerted
by her sudden passion but the secret
was lost  

  oh yes and even on this far world

we know how it was lost all the uni-
verse has heard of orthis of how the
vardda drove him into the depths of
space and destroyed him when he would
have shared his knowledge and so you
are free and i am chained and my chil-
dren after me forever

  she turned abruptly away from him
he looked after her disturbed and
oppressed by the revelation of what
bitter depths of hostility lay behind the
faces of the non-vardda

  but yann shook his shoulder kurat
has made a kill today-a rare skin
come outside and look at it its worth
money

less from interest than to escape hia
own oppression trehearne rose
they went out a back way there was a
shed some distance away where kurat
said the hide was drying yann and he
chattered in the unfamiliar jargon tre-
hearne was not much interested in the
whole business

  it was dark inside the shed yann
said wait a minute while i make a
light

  trehearne waited but not long the
light exploded inside his own skull he
heard kurat grunt behind him with the
exertion of the blow then laugh yann
was laughing too

  trehearne knew a moment of murder-
ous fury and then the world of the green
star slipped away from under him

  when it returned again into his ken
he was sprawled on his face in mud
stripped of his tunic his jewelled belt
his sandals the hut of kurat had van-
ished the town with it he was in the
forest encircled by trees whose crystal
branches glittered under the savage
stars his head hurt and he had no
weapon

  he got unsteadily to his feet with
only one thought in mind-the deter-
mination to get his hands on his good
friend yann he took three steps in no
particular direction-and then stopped
bathed in a sudden icy sweat

  in the distance and not too far away
he heard the high-pitched cry of kurats
strange hounds
	startling stories

chapter ix

the hunting of trehearne

it dawned upon trehearne then that
this was not merely assault and rob-
bery this was murder he had walked
unsuspecting into a trap haa sat there
while yann and kurat talked jovially
over his head arranging the details of
its springing

  they would not want his body in the
hut or in the town they would not
want it to look like murder they would
carry him into the forest then set the
hounds after him and leave the beasts
to do the final work who could be
blamed if a drunken vardda wandered
off where he had no business to be and
was pulled down by a pack of hounds

  he wondered if yann and kurat were
following the hunt

  and why did yann want him dead

  he began to run

  the ropy vines that crept and clam-
bered among the crystal trees were like
nooses set to catch his feet he fell and
rose and ran again and the spongy
ground gave treacherously it was very
hot and he was heavy heavy with the
drag of a heavy world

  behind him clear and shrill came
the yap-yap-yaahhh  of kurats weasel
hounds racing over a fresh scent the
crystal branches gleamed and sparkled
tipped with star-fire-sharp-tipped like
spears trehearne stopped and tried to
break one and it was like trying to break
a bar of steel with his bare hands he
gave it up and fled onward not know-
ing where he was or where he was go-
ing only wanting to stay away from
thelithe white demons that pursued him

  there was a little river black and
warm he waded upstream in it splash-
ing to his waist swimming the deeper
pools the bitter wine had left him
thirsty and he drank the water tasted
foully of pitch and slime and he spat it
out again gasping

  he heard the voice of the pack change

to a querulous whining as they checked
by the bank he sank down to rest and
listened to them casting back and forth
he thought he heard a mans voice
shouting but could not be sure

  he went on again striking into the
forest the great stars were pounding
against his head and his body was leaden
with many extra pounds of weight by
gravitation

  trehearne prayed for a fallen branch
but there was none he prayed to find
the town and that too was denied him
he ran heavily under the glittering trees
and behind him the hounds burst sud-
denly into full cry more distant now
but as chilling to the blood

  it would not be long before they over-
took him

  he measured the trees with an eye
to climbing one for refuge they were
glassy and badly shaped and they were
low he remembered the long whipcord-
bodies of the weasel-like beasts he
thought they could leap as high as they
needed to pull him down

  he staggered on and every time he
fell it was harder to get up again the
cry of the pack swept closer

  abruptly from somewhere ahead of
him came the challenging voices of
other hounds

  trehearne stopped despairing he
was caught now between two fires
there was no use in going on he choked
on the acrid gorge of fear and cast about
for a weapon something anything to
hold in his hands to kill with at least a
little before he was torn apart

  it came to him that the yelping of the
beasts ahead was stationary and irri-
table they were not hunting they were
chained

  trehearne sobbed he began to run
again

  there was a clearing he saw it ahead
dimly through the starshine and the
trees he strove to reach it and the pack
cry clamored at his heels

  he tripped and pitched headlong and
was almost happy because he had fallen
over a tangle of branches left from the
breaking of the crystal trees he caught
one up tt was not long but it was better
the strmen of llyrdis	

than nothing

  he plunged forward into the edge of
the clearing it was there that the
hounds of kurat bayed him

  swift and undulant white as frost
in the starlight they came leaping be-
tween the glistening trees they voiced
one final cry of triumph and then were
still still as arrows in mid-flight

 trehearne set his back against a
glassy trunk their fangs were like hot
irons in his flesh and he was as mad-
dened as they

  there was a hut across the clearing
four of the hunting-beasts were leashed
beside it a man a woman and a tall
boy came out of the hut the boy started
to run toward trehearne shouting the
man caught him he spoke to the boy
and made him be still they stood there
watching

  trehearne swung his broken crystal
branch

one he killed and one he crippled
the remaining six boiled around
him a liquid tangle of bodies leaping
flowing slashing with the white knives
of their teeth the blood ran on tre-
hearnes body he swung and swung
again and still the man and woman
watched stolidly and did not move

  the boy cried out and the man cuffed
him

 trehearne yelled and dropped the
branch one of the brutes had fastened
on his wrist its weight dragged him to
his knees and he knew that this was
the finish the last of his voyaging
amidst the stars he tore the strong
jaws out of his flesh and swung the
brute as a flail in the faces of its mates
and then he could hold it no longer and
the pack closed in

  the boy had slunk back into the shad-
ows by the hut wall now suddenly he
reached and slipped the thongs from
around the necks of the tethered hounds

  they tore across the clearing over the
jagged stumps and flung themselves
upon the pack of kurat

  for a moment the beasts forgot tre-
hearne he scrambled free of the snarl-
ing tangle and went toward the hut

the man rushed by him howling he
picked up a branch and began to beat
the hounds struggling to separate them
the woman wailed and ran to help him
the boy came to trehearne

  he was not much above sixteen tall
and well made he put his arm around
trehearnes waist and took him into the
hut and sat him down trehearne was
glad to sit the room reeled and dark-
ened around him when his sight cleared
the boy had brought cloths and a pun-
gent salve and was binding his cuts

  what is your name asked tre-
hearne in the lingua franca

  torin

  you saved my life torin i will not
forget it

  i would do anything for the vardda
instead of hate there was hero-worship
in this non-vardda face it was obvious
that in the boys eyes trehearne was a
figure of glory trehearne was touched

  torin stared at him his task forgot-
ten and he asked the question the old
unchanging question that was always
on the lips of boys what is it like-
what is it really like to fly between the
stars

  trehearne put his hand on the lean
young shoulder and lied it is long and
hard and not nearly as adventurous as
hunting ill wager that youre as good
a hunter as your father

  not yet said torin some day 
he bent to his work again his fingers
moved over trehearnes flesh touching
the muscles spreading the wounds gen-
tle with the thick salve he scowled
brooding over some question of his own

  it feels like mine he said it bleeds
like mine and here is an old scar and
there will be new ones it is not a differ-
ent flesh made of iron or some other
thing

  he sprang up look he cried i
am strong very strong see my flesh is
hard like yours surely it is not true
that only the vardda can fly in the great
ships surely i am strong enough to go
out and see the stars

  trehearne could not meet his eager
eyes he said it takes a different kind
of strength he tried to explain md
	startling stories

gave it up he could only say im
sorry

  he got up will you guide me to the
compound torin and think what you
would like out of all the things that are
there i cant take my life from you
without giving something back-a little
gift between friends

  torin whispered i want to see the
ship

  trehearne frowned and in the inter-
val of silence he heard the noises from
the clearing-the whining growl of the
hounds and a sudden lifting of human
voices

  torin he said look out and see
who has come

  he flattened himself in the corner be-
hind the door the boy opened it and
peered

  two have just come into the clear-
ing he whispered a hunter whose
name is kurat-and a vardda he
drew back and looked at trehearne
they were hunting you

  trehearne nodded his face had tight-
ened and grown cruel give me a
knife

  torin handed him a skinning blade
of crystal chipped to a razor edge tre-
hearne said go and tell them i am
dead from the hounds tearing tell the
vardda to come and help you carry out
my body and see that he comes in
first

  torin hesitated then he went tre-
hearne heard him calling across the
clearing the gabble of voices increased
and yanns familiar laughter sounded
the boy was talking telling the details
of trehearnes dying

  yann strode into the hut

  he came confidently he had nothing
to fear and then trehearnes arm was
around his throat and the point of the
knife was biting in under the angle of
the jaw

  dont move said trehearne and
again dont move

  yann stood still

  undo your belt and let it drop

  yann did that very carefully lest tre-
hearne become nervous blood ran down
the side of his neck youll cut the

vein he whispered no deeper please
no deeper

  the belt dropped trehearne set his
foot on it then he flung yann from
him savagely so that he fell sprawling
on the floor torin stood wide-eyed in
the doorway watching

  trehearne knelt and took the little
prismed shock-tube swiftly from its
sheath on yanns belt now he said
he did not take his eyes off yann keep
watch torin and tell me if anyone
comes

  they are busy with the hounds and
with talking the boy said

yann sat sullenly on the floor hold-
ing his neck he glowered at tre-
hearne but he made no move to rise

  this wasnt my idea he said i was
only doing a job you dont have to kill
me

  i dont have to but id enjoy it
whose idea was it yann

  he was going to give me a ship
yann muttered a ship of my own any
man would do it for a price like that
youd do it yourself trehearne thats
just common sense

  trehearne said who offered you a
ship

  kerrel you go fight it out with him
ive got nothing against you trehearne
it was just a business deal one life one
ship you fight it out with kerrel

  trehearne kicked him youre not
worth killing get up and get out and
yann-

  yes

  stay away from me

  all right all right but i dont see
that youve so much to complain about
yann hauled himself upright and start-
ed toward the door im the loser
youre alive arent you and ive lost
a ship

  thats too bad said trehearne
you and kurat can go away and mourn
about it and if i were you i would go
fast

  yann glanced back at him he began
to run within seconds he and kurat
had leashed what was left of the pack
and vanished out of the clearing
the starmen of llyrdis	

  trehearne watched them go he was
shaking with fury already he had for-
gotten yann he was thinking of kerrel
he can be deadly shairn had said
the man and woman returned slowly
to the hut in his hand by its loose
scruff the man carried a limp dead
hound he flung it down at torins feet

  theres your work he said two
of the others will not hunt for days we
will go hungry because you are a fool
he did not look at trehearne the
woman did with stolid indifference
torin said angrily i dont care i
couldnt just stand and watch him die
the man growled learn to think of
your own and not the vardda you will
be happier

  trehearne picked up yanns fine jew-
elled belt and tossed it on the table
thatll pay you for your hound he
went out across the clearing and in a
minute torin joined him pointing out
the path

  im sorry he said my parents are
good and kind but they do not under-
stand the vardda

  perhaps they do said trehearne
better than you know

 it was morning when they reached
the compound a green morning op-
pressed with heat trehearne was ready
to drop but torin strode blithely ahead
and all the way he talked of the great
ship he would accept no other gift but
that to see the ship and he pleaded so
that trehearne had not the heart to
refuse him

  after all it was little enough reward
for what the boy had done

  it was the last great day of the trad-
ing and all the vardda were inside the
compound except one man who guarded
the saarga the hatches were closed
only the airlock port was open and the
guard sat in front of it yawning in
the heat

 he brightened up when trehearne
came what happened to you he de-
manded and laughed a big night eh 
i spent it with a pack of hounds
trehearne answered and spoke to him
about torin

 the guard looked doubtful its

against the rules-the skipperd have
my head if he found out

  how can he find out dont worry
ill see the boy gets clear of the ship
you can look the other way

  the guard could not withstand torins
hungry gaze well-all right only be
sure you get the kid out again fast
trehearne saw to it he showed torin
what he could from the bridge to the
generator-rooms and the boy trod softly
as though he were in a holy place touch-
ing sighing wondering trehearne was
sorry he had brought him he felt a pity
to see that longing that could never be
fulfilled

 he pressed upon torin what few
trinkets from other star-worlds he had
in his own cabin and led him out from
the ship and stood with the guard
watching the boy go slowly away across
the field looking back always back un-
til he was lost behind the compound wall

star-crazy like all the rest of them
said the guard well hell get over it
i suppose so said trehearne and
was glad he would not see torin again

  he went into the factory found the
doctor and told the captain a brief story
of how he had had too much wine in the
town and been set upon by stray hounds
the captain remarked that it was no
more than he deserved and bade him
learn thereby the folly of breaking rules
trehearne slept until he was routed out
to check the lading

  toward midnight the cargo was all
aboard and the hatches locked the
saarga lifted into the star-shot sky and
the acceleration built and built to the
thrust of the throbbing generators

  trehearne was almost asleep again
when he heard the screaming

chapter x
death between stars

they found torin lying beside the
well that led up from the hold he
had made it that far his skin was al-
	startling stories

ready darkened with the subcutaneous
hemorrhage his body twisted and
writhing his face almost unrecogniz-
able and he screamed and would not
stop

  trehearne held him and watched him
die

  it seemed to take a long long time
it was not a clean death it was dissolu-
tion trehearne remembered his own
torment and there was nothing he could

do

  the others watched also with sick
white faces in the end it was the guard
who went to fetch a cloth to wrap the
body in and there were tears on his
cheeks

  trehearne laid torin on the sheet
his flesh was not hard any more he
was no longer straight and well made
he was not even a dead boy he was a
rag a shapelessness an obscenity it
crossed trehearnes mind how nearly
he had come to dying that same death

  he got up he returned to his cabin
stripped and scrubbed himself in a kind
of frenzy he kicked his sodden gar-
ments into the corridor for someone else
to deal with he could not touch them
again and all the time he heard torins
voice crying surely i am strong
enough to go out and see the stars

  they came a little later and told tre-
hearne that they had found where torin
had hidden himself under the wrappings
of a bale to be carried aboard with the
cargo

  it wasnt your fault they told him
there was no way you could have seen
the boy

  trehearne was not comforted

  they buried torin in deep space to
drift forever among the suns of her-
cules and trehearne thought of a hut
of a man and a woman who were wait-
ing for their son to come home he
wished that torin had listened to the
wisdom of his father

  the saarga tramped her way onward
among the worlds of the cluster time
and events gave trehearne other things
to think about he was a starman now
tested and hardened a functioning part
of his environment his horizons were

boundless and the stars had not lost
their lustre but somehow even so the
first fine flush of glory was gone

  he remembered the bitterness of the
woman who had said you are free
and i am chained and my children after
me forever he remembered the count-
less young men who hungered the eyes
of children wide with dreams each time
he saw the new-healed scars on his body
he remembered the boy who had dressed
those wounds and found the vardda
flesh no different from his own-a
treachery too subtle for his understand-
ing

  over and over when he slept he held
torin in his arms and watched him die

  he told himself that it was all wasted
pity whatever had been done to orthis
long ago was not his doing things were
as they were and there was no help for
it he was one of the lucky ones and he
should be content with that

  most of the time he was content but
now and again there would come the
small sharp doubts the creeping sense
of guilt

  if only torin had not come aboard
the ship to die

  he needed to talk to edri he needed
to ease his mind to get things straight
with himself and he knew that edri
would understand

  he was glad when they started the
long haul back to llyrdis he discovered
that much as he wanted to see edri he
wanted even more to see shairn he
wondered if she had forgotten him by
now or if she would be waiting when
the saarga landed

  the voyage back seemed to take a
million years and yann was always
there a constant reminder to trehearne
that there was someone else he had to
see on llyrdis

  the saarga made her worldfall at last
under the tawny-red glare of aldebaran
trehearne watched the golden planet
rush and grow toward the ship he
cheered with the others at the first sight
of home and did not think it odd that
he should strain as eagerly as they to
see the familiar towers of the city rising
out of the mountain-girdled plain
the starmen of llyrdis	

  the freighter found her dock and wal-
lowed into it

  joris was on hand to watch his ship
come in he had been in contact with
the saarga by the ultra-wave radio and
now he boarded her before her ports
were fairly open the skipper had given
him good news of the venture and he was
in jovial spirits clapping shoulders all
around peering at manifests firing
questions demanding to know how tre-
hearne had acquitted himself

  a good voyage eh he cried well
any voyage through the cluster is a
good one if someone doesnt get killed

  trehearne said bitterly someone
did

  joris stared at him uncomprehend-
ing

  oh not one of the crew a native
boy crazy to fly the stars he stowed
away

  all the light went out of joris face
leaving it bleak it was a long time be-
fore he spoke and then it was only to
make a routine statement about the ship
he seemed to have lost all his joy in it
trehearne was surprised at the impact
that those few words about a nameless
boy had had on the old man

  joris left soon after he told tre-
hearne ill see you in a day or so mean-
while i think shairn is waiting for you
at the sector gate he spoke as though
his mind were not really on what he was
saying

  he turned away then hesitated and
asked how old was that boy tre-
hearne

  about sixteen

joris nodded he walked away across
the apron as though he carried on
his massive shoulders some heavy bur-
den that weighed them down

  trehearne signed over his manifests
to the port official in charge of unload-
ing and went in search of shairn

  she stood outside the great barred
gate watching for him she was just
as beautiful as he remembered he
caught her in his arms and kissed her
and her lips were just as he remembered
them

  he said you havent forgotten me
then

  no did you expect me to

  i wouldnt have been surprised
she laughed-the sweet familiar
laughter spiced with mockery youre
a wise man she cocked her head back
and studied him youve changed
youve got so brown and hard and-
older i think i like you even better now
but ill have to learn to know you all
over again

  she pulled him toward the long sleek
vehicle that waited it will be nice
she said this getting acquainted
again

  a broad road took them northward
along the coast away from the clamor-
ing spaceport and the city cliffs began
to rise from the golden sea wild and
rocky trehearne had been this way be-
fore and now he saw nothing but shairn

  she asked suddenly where did yo
get that

  his sleeve had fallen back and diet
was looking at the scars on his wrist

  someone set the hounds on me tre-i
hearne answered indifferently then
by the way how is kerrel

  i havent seen him hes not in the
city she glanced at the scars again
how did he work it

  how did who work what

  oh stop trying to be subtle i was
pretty sure that kerrel would arrange
something for that voyage hes not a
man who takes his defeats lightly
trehearne told her briefly the story
of yann and the hounds he finished i
want to see kerrel

  you will shairns eyes sparkled
and i want to be there when you do
the car swung around a curve where
a great crag jutted out from the sea
backed by a mountain wall on it seem-
ing as proud and enduring as the rock
was built a tower faced all in silvery
metal

  the wind and the spray beat upon it
the wild things of the ocean sky nested
at its feet yet its tall windows looked
over the distant city and counted every
ship that came and went from the
sprawling port trehearne had been-
	startling

here before too it was shairns ances-
tral home built by generations of vard-
da men and women reaching out with
strong hands to grasp the stars-the
silver tower which gave her her name

  inside it was trehearne who led the
way to the long gallery looking to the
west a place of cool pastels that tem-
pered the molten glory of the sea for a
time with shairn he forgot about ker-
rel and torin and all the things that
preyed upon his mind he only knew
that it was very good to be here again

  it was evening when he was again
reminded of them they were still sit-
ting in the gallery sipping the sharp
cold wines and shairn said are you
happy michael

  he remembered another time when
she had asked that question-the night
that edri had walked away alone down
the avenue of trees he remembered
edri crying out in the dark against in-
justice and instantly the old restlessness
was back upon him

  yes he said yes im happy he
turned the wine-glass in his hands
brooding shairn could you get edri
out here id like to see him

  he felt her stiffen and draw away
and he thought that she was angry with
him he went on it doesnt have to be
now tomorrows time enough but i-
well i want to talk to him

  youre fond of edri arent you
  he was a good friend to me

  yes-and to me she turned around
you might as well know now as later
edri was arrested a month ago
trehearne sprang up arrested
yes they sentenced him yestorday
exile to thuvis-for the rest of his nat-
ural life

        chapter xi
        fateful decision

for a moment trehearne stood still
like a man stunned thmis-for
the rest of his natural life

 stories

  no he said not edri there must
be some mistake

  shairn shook her head i wish there
were but there isnt edri is an orthist
caught confessed and convicted he was
unable even to offer a defense

she turned away from him i dont
like it either but edri knew what he
was doing he brought this on himself
trehearne asked what happened
you remember that night in the wine
garden when kerrel spoke of a man
named arrin who had been arrested
yes he was a friend of edris
well they couldnt find arrins pa-
pers they wanted them very badly it
seemed that arrin had found some clue
to the course of orthis ship on that last
voyage when it was lost and had been
making calculations

  she paused then added grimly ker-
rel got the idea that edri hd those
papers

  trehearnes yellow eyes took on a
peculiarly evil glint then kerrel was
at the bottom of this

  thats why he retired to his estate
for a while hes not very popular just
now everybody liked edri they dont
approve of his ideas but kerrel went
about it in such an underhanded way
setting spies on edri and digging pits
for him to fall into hes told all over
just how cleverly he did it now hes got
himself appointed as an agent of the
council on the strength of it well he
did his duty edri had the papers all
right and more of his own

  trehearne groaned the idealistic
fool why wasnt he satisfied to be a
vardda himself without worrying about
the rest of the galaxy

  shairn seemed relieved then thats
what i said but knowing your friend-
ship for edri i was afraid youd lose
your head when you heard

  she went on quickly i know youll
have a reckoning with kerrel over this
and your own score but youll have to
be careful and clever since hes now a
council agnt i can help you-

  but shairns voice faded out of tre-
hearnes hearing except for that one
phrase
the starmen of llyrdis

 -knowing your friendship for

edri-

 yes edri had been his friend he
was sorry for edri but should he let
friendship be a chain to drag him back
down from all that he had dreamed and
desired and finally achieved

 no he would not let himself be
trapped by friendship and by pity he
had been merely indulging in emotion-
alism to sympathize as he had with the
non-vardda peoples hunger for star-
freedom to remember as he had the
hopeless longing in their eyes to brood
as he had over the dying of torin

  a sick fatal foreboding grew in tre-
hearne as he realized the decision shap-
ing in his mind he knew that it was
shaped by emotion not by reason and
he felt a savage contempt for his own
weakness

 he spoke interrupting shairn im
sorry shairn i was thinking and i
think ive got to try to help edri

  she stopped looking at him with wide
steady eyes then rapidly michael
dont be a fool

  he smiled mirthlessly thats what
ive been telling myself but it doesnt
work it seems that im determined to
be a fool

  youre taking it too tragically after
all edris not going to be executed
remembering edris words about the
fate of arrin trehearne answered i
think hed almost prefer that exiled to
a remote star never to fly again noth-
ing to do but sit and wait for death-
no

  but theres nothing you can do
michael hes convicted sentenced
theyre taking him off tonight so
theres an end to it

  trehearne rose to his feet im going
back to the city chairn

  for what

  im going to try to get him away

she understood then the full depth
and danger of his thinking she
caught him fiercely by the arm

  are you going to throw away every-
thing youve worked so hard to get for

nothing remember edris a traitor
no matter how good a friend he was to
both of us hes a traitor and deserves his
punishment

  thats how you feel is it

  is there any other way i could feel
you know what the orthists are as well
as i do

  he said quietly im not sure i do
perhaps youd better tell me

  theyre destroyers they want to
ruin llyrdis the vardda trade every-
thing as it is now her passionate voice
took in the star-trails the swift ships
flying the vardda pride of race and
achievement

  orthis had his laboratory in his ship
the secret of the vardda mutation is
there they want to find that ship they
want to find the secret in it and spread
it all across the galaxy

  would it be so terrible asked tre-
hearne if others should have the abil-
ity to fly between the stars

  she looked at him as though he had
spoken blasphemy he added except
of course that it would wreck the vard-
da monopoly

  that sounds very strange coming
from you she said bitterly you the
outsider who fought so hard to be a
part of the monopoly it looked pretty
good to you then after thirty-three years
of crawling in the mud of earth

  ive seen more of it now ive seen
a boy die because of it i dont think i
like it any longer

  you dont like it her voice was
low and passionate you and what do
you know about it  we earned the right
to what we have we were the first-
first of all the races of the galaxy to
go into interstellar space

  and we did it without mutation
without anything four generations
that first voyage took four generations
of children born in deep space in a little
ship crawling between the stars no one
else ever did that no one else ever
dared

  and as for our wicked monopoly-
it keeps the peace of the galaxy it keeps
worlds alive that would have died it
brings wealth and comfort where they

never were before but you dont like it
and so it must be destroyed

  she stopped for breath and then she
whispered you make me ashamed that

i	have loved you

  she turned from him and went swift-
ly along the gallery there was a pur-
pose about the way she did it that mde
trehearne uneasy he followed her and
found her at the visiphone the screen
was already brightening

  she looked at him with blazing eyes
i fought once to get you into llyrdis
now ill undo that mistake

he struck her away from the instru-
ment and closed the switch she
was on him then like a cat clawing him
calling him mongrel and freak and
worse names raging at his ingratitude
she was hard to hold but he held her and
she could reach neither the visiphone
nor the bell to call her servants

  he held her and she laughed her
mocking laugh at him all right go on
then go and make a fool of yourself
trying to free edri see how far you get
and remember that its bad enough for
a vardda born to betray his people but
for you-

  he held her a moment longer swal-
lowing his own rage thinking he could
not let her go the moment he left she
would send out the alarm denounce him
to the council put an end both to his
own freedom and to any remote hope he
might have of saving edri

  it took him only a few seconds to de-
cide in the mood he was in it was not
difficult to strike the necessary caftf ully-
calculated blow

  he carried her out to the car in his
arms if any of the servants were watch-
ing it would look very sweet very ro-
mantic her dark head on his shoulder
her arms around his neck they would
not be able to see that her wrists were
tied

  he put her down gently in the padded
seat she did not stir there was the
shadow of a bruise already forming on
her chin he got in beside her and sent
the car humming down the wide road
that led to the city
the starmen of llyrdis



when he was far enough away
from the tower he stopped he
bound shairn securely with strips torn
from her own garments taking especial
care with the gag he arranged her on
the floor as comfortably as he could out
of sight then he drove on and did not
stop again until he reached the space-
port

 the lights were still on in the office
of joris probably he would stay late
tonight to oversee the business of tak-
ing edri away in the prison ship tre-
hearne felt guilty about joris almost as
though he were betraying his own
father the old man had been good to
him

 shairn seemed to be safely uncon-
scious trehearne left the car where he
thought it would be least likely to attract
attention and went into the administra-
tion building he had only the vague
beginnings of a plan in his mind but
whatever he did it would have to start
here

 the roar and bustle of the spaceport
were not diminished by darkness some
of the vardda officers he knew they
hailed him as he passed them in the cor-
ridors congratulating him on his voy-
age asking him when he was going out
again trehearne almost faltered then
thinking what a fool he was to give up
all this for an idle hope and then he
remembered edri and went on edri
had done his best for him when he
needed it it seemed that he could not
do less for edri

 the lift took him up to the high room
that was like the bridge of a starship
that would never fly joris was there
he was quite alone he had been drink-
ing for some time but he was not drunk
he looked up when trehearne came in
and his eyes were heavy and rimmed
with red

 what do you want he said

 a favor

 another time trehearne get out
get the hell out

 another time wont do trehearne
leaned over the table theyre taking
edri out for thuvis tonight i want to
say goodbye to him joris thats all

just a word before he goes tell me what
ship it is and where-or if you cant
do that tell me what sector and ill see
him outside the gate

  thats right said joris youre a
friend of edris he reached for the
wine bottle there was an empty one
beside it and another on the floor how
good a friend trehearne thats what
id like to know how good a friend
his bloodshot gaze was sharp and
very shrewd

  trehearne said angrily you know
im not mixed up with him you know
where ive been

  yes i know youve been watching a
young boy die in space what did you
think when you saw that trehearne
how did you feel

  lets not talk about that said tre-
hearne harshly tell me where i can
see edri and when that isnt much to
ask joris just a minute to say good-
bye

  a boy sixteen whispered joris
full of hope full of longing proud of
his strength  i ought to hate you
trehearne youre not even half vardda
in the ordinary way and yet you can fly
the stars

  he filled his glass again and emptied
it his hands were steady he was
neither drunk nor maudlin and yet
there were tears in his eyes trehearne
saw them and was somehow shocked
it did not seem possible that joris could
weep

  joris he said gently forget about
the boy let me see edri

  again the red-rimmed leaden gaze
locked with his weighing measuring
i like you trehearne so ill tell you
again get out go away forget you
ever came here

  trehearne did not move abruptly
joris picked up the empty bottle and
flung it not at him but near him get
out you fool im giving you a chance
to go

  there was nothing to do but obey
trehearne moved toward the door
thinking angrily that he would have to
risk the sector map in operations he
stretched out his hand to the latch and
	startling stories

the door opened under it fast and he
was looking straight into the prism lens
of a shock tube held by a tall spaceport
guard shairn was beside the guard
the guard said back up
trehearne backed he looked at
shairn i should have clipped you again
to make sure

  you should i got my feet loose quite
easily this silk is pretty flimsy stuff
she walked past him toward joris the
guard came in and closed the door set-
ting his back against it

  joris demanded whats all this
about

  i found her out by the gate the
guard said she was gagged and her
hands were tied

  trehearne said shairn to joris
hes an orthist he came here to help
edri escape

  did he said joris did he now
he looked at trehearne you stand
where you are dont try anything he
reached into a drawer of the table and
covered him with the lens of another
tube

  an orthist eh he said softly he
began to laugh

chapter xii
the fight at the spaceport

shairn sat down on the edge of
joris table she smiled at tre-
hearne and in this moment he hated her
he looked from joris to the guard and
back again and did nothing there was
nothing then that he could do

  would you have believed it of him
joris said shairn would you have
thought that he could turn on us after
all we did for him 

  joris leaned back in his chair
shairn he said im sorry it had to
be this way

  yes she answered and then added
bitterly kerrel was right about him
after all

  joris said that isnt what i mean

  something in his tone made shairn
turn and look at him he went on im
sorry you got yourself into this youre
only doing what you believe to be right
but so is trehearne so am i

  he dropped his bombshell so quietly
that for a moment neither shairn nor
trehearne could quite believe that they
had understood him

  shairn got up off the edge of the table
she backed away her eyes fixed on joris
in horrified incredulity you joris
you an orthist her tone made the
words a denial

  but joris nodded and said yes
abruptly trehearne laughed shairn
swung around you heard she said
to the guard arrest joris

  the guard shook his head and smiled
hardly im joris man

  it was shairns turn now to stand
like a trapped thing searching for es-
cape and not finding it

  trehearne said may i move now
his voice was a bit shaky with relief

  joris grinned i didnt want you
throwing yourself around somebody
might have got hurt yes you can
move

  shairn burst out i cant understand
this joris you of all people-its
insane

  perhaps but i think trehearne
would understand he scowled at his
own hands brooding and then he said
it doesnt matter who knows now i did
the forbidden thing i married a woman
of another world a non-vardda i had
a son he wanted to fly the stars he
used to beg me to take him aboard my
ship

  after all he was my son half-
vardda he thought he could do it he
hid himself away in my cabin and-the
vardda blood had not bred true in him
he glanced briefly at trehearne he
was not quite eighteen i never flew
another voyage after that

  he got up kicking the empty bottle
away i guess that was why i first gave
trehearne his chance it seemed to make
up in a way for-

  he broke off abruptly well thats
over and done with we have other
the starmen of llyrdis	

things to think about and not much
time to do them in trehearne youve
upset my plans rather badly by fetch-
ing in miss spitfire here

  it wasnt intentional he went to
joris is it true then youre going
to get edri free 

  im going to try you see this is a
thing i could only do once ive had
to sit here for years watching more
than one good man go out to thuvis
waiting-waiting for the time when i
could make my action really count now
its here he turned and glowered at
shairn the main question is-what
are we going to do with you

  she answered him angrily and with-
out fear whatever you do youll live
to regret it

  hm said joris tie her up again
trehearne

 he did so with immense pleasure
this time he used stouter bonds and
took extra pains with the knots

 joris paced up and down thinking
hard i hate to say this but theres only
one place i know of where theres no
danger of her being found before were
gone and thats aboard the ship

  the guard said there wont be any
time to get her off again

  i know it said joris grimly so it
looks as though well have an extra pas-
senger

  trehearne had finished with the gag
he looked at shairn her eyes burned
and her face was white above the cloth

  joris threw his cloak over her take
her down in my private lift he told the
guard the sector has already been
cleared so you wont have any trouble
there get her aboard and make damned
sure shes locked in

the guard nodded he picked up the
cloak-wrapped bundle and put it
over his shoulder the buzzer of the
visiphone made a sudden jarring sound
joris motioned the man to hurry waited
until he was gone before answering
trehearne pressed himself back against
the wall out of range of the screen

 kerrels voice said joris-were
bringing edri down in exactly fifteen

minutes is everything ready

  joris nodded the sector is cleared
the guards are posted and the ship is
ready for take-off

  good theres a good bit of feeling
about this business and we dont want
any trouble

  ive seen to it joris told him

  the screen went dark the swine
said joris hes only doing what he be-
lieves is right but hes so bloody smug
about it agent of the council bah
unexpectedly he caught trehearnes
shoulders in a bearlike grip that nearly
broke them

  im glad youre with us are you
armed 

  yes

  come on then this is the end of
my waiting im going back to space
trehearne im going to do the things

i	knew id have to do some day after i
watched my son die come on then-
move

  they went down in the tiny private
lift and out of the building to a guarded
sector where the lights burned brightly
over silent ships where there were no
swarming mobs of non-vardda work-
men no clatter of machinery and whiz-
zing of busy trams only the deserted
aprons of the great docks and the empty
spaces between them

  as they went joris told trehearne
what he had to do only the guards at
the gate and the four who will pick
up kerrels men when they come
through belong to me the others we
hope will be too far away to interfere
but well have no time to linger
where is the prison ship

  i spotted that at the far end of the
sector and theyll find its generators
shot when they try to follow us the
orthists are strong among the non-
vardda the mechanics were glad to
do that little job for me

  joris spoke briefly to the guards
about trehearne they nodded a wel-
come in about ten minutes joris said
is the girl aboard

  all secure sir

  good come along trehearne he
led the way past two of the towering
	startling stories

docks by the time they reached the
third they were out of sight and hearing
of the gate in this third dock was a
long rakish starship lightless and silent
all hatches closed except the port

  the mirzim the ship were taking
said joris a long-distance light trader
built for speed well well need that it
belongs by the way to a good friend of
mine hell have to collect from the two
good cargo-ships im leaving behind
he added the crews waiting in-
side now only a half-crew really-not
many navigators and technicians are
dependable orthists

  he stationed trehearne in the shad-
ows under the corner of the apron
well jump them right here try not
to kill anyone as soon as edri is free
make for the mirzim

  right trehearne settled back into
the patch of darkness hidden from any-
one walking past in the areaway he
held his shock tube ready in his hand
joris was already gone heading back
to the gate

  trehearne listened to the sounds of
the spaceport the sharp smell of the
sea was in the wind and in the distance
he could see the shining towers of the
city he thought that this was probably
the last time he would ever see llyrdis

  he knew a stabbing pang of regret
and then coming from the direction of
the gate he heard the rhythmic tramp
of perhaps a dozen men moving at a
brisk pace toward him he was glad
that the wait was no longer

  he did not move but his body quiv-
ered settling itself

  there was joris walking first with
kerrel there were four men without
uniforms there was a fifth man and
beside him edri with his right wrist
linked to the mans left there were four
more men without uniforms then four
of joris guards

  the head of the little column passed
the corner of the third dock the four
guards broke rank and pulled out their
shock tubes aiming the pallid beams at
an angle to avoid hitting edri

  trehearne sprang out and joined
them

  three of kerrels men went down
on that first assault two were uncon-
scious but one could still use his shock-
er joris had caught kerrel unawares
and knocked him down with nothing
more than his great hammer of a fist
he pulled out his own weapon then
and waded in

  a vicious dogfight began swirling
around with edri as its center edri
grappled with his guard and they fell
both struggling both hampered by tbe
fetters

both sides quit using the shockers
the fighting was too close for that
a small blundering nasty mele of fists
and feet men stumbling over each
other hitting the wrong people in their
haste going down getting up again
shouting for help swearing astonished
furious

  trehearne trying to get to edri
smashed one man solidly in the face and
sent another staggering then he was
tripped and was kicked as he went down
he found himself sprawling on top of
edri who grunted and struck at him
then said oh its you the key is in
his belt

  trehearne chopped down with his
fist the mans head rang on the con-
crete he lay still and trehearne found
the key

  a heavy weight descended on him
from behind grinding his face into the
cement the hand that held the key
was pinioned in an iron grip he
thrashed about trying to unseat his at-
tacker and in the meantime edri had
grabbed his hand as well wrenching
and clawing with a single-minded deter-
mination to have the key

  he got it trehearne managed to get
his knees under him and roll he saw
kerrels face close to his in a second
the two men had each other by the
throat

  they strained together breast to
breast like two lovers kicked and
trampled by the feet of other men ob-
livious edri got free and rose he would
have struck kerrel but trehearne
gasped no ill handle him
the starmen of llyrdis	

 kerrel smiled an anguished baring
of the teeth his thumbs bit hard into
trehearnes neck

  trehearne let go of kerrels throat
he bunched his two fists together and
struck upward kerrels head snapped
back his hands loosened trehearne
tore them away he threw himself on
top of kerrel he hit him hard in the
face until kerrels head rolled like the
head of a dead man

 hands grasped him and tried to drag
him away he shook them off kerrel
moaned and turned on his side tre-
hearne kicked him with his sandalled
feet thats for yann he grunted
thats for the hounds and for torin
a voice roared at him leave it
damn you leave it a very strong
arm thrust him aside he recognized
joris there were distant sounds of
shouting coming closer kerrels men
were down or scattered their own men
were running for the mirzim dragging
with them several who were stunned
or partly paralyzed edri with a bleed-
ing face was capering joyously and
yelling at him to hurry

  trehearne shook his head to clear it
he ran beside joris stumbling up the
metal stair to the apron he was the last
one through the port joris hauled down
a lever and the port closed and locked
itself automatically with a squeal of
compressed air

 instantly the lights went on the
great generators jarred to life joris
strode heavily down the long corridor
to the bridge with trehearne at his
heels there was another man sitting
there but joris took over the pilot chair

 trehearne waited tensely but joris
did not touch the controls he merely
sat there inspecting his bruised fists

  what the hell are you waiting for
trehearne cried weve only got a few
moments at most

  joris looked at him stolidly weve
only got one life too we can throw it
away by starting at the wrong moment
and colliding with incoming ships i
know the dispatch-schedules wait
trehearne waited he could not hear
inside the ship but he knew that by now

 alarms must be shrilling all over the
spaceport

  it was mad to wait it was craven
surrender better to run any risk of
suicidal collision than to wait   

  and still joris waited an eye cocked
on the chronometers until through the
window trehoarne saw lights flashing
up outside and men running and then
he overheard the loom of a great ship
descending fast

  joris grunted suddenly punched the
controls hang on

  the mirzim went up in a screaming
arc that crumpled trehearne to the
deck he clung to a stanchion and
prayed that joris had not lost his skill

  he had not even the vardda flesh
had limits so did metal and the bones
of ships joris knew to the fraction ex-
actly how much they could stand the
course had already been calculated he
cleared the system found his coordi-
nates then hammered the signal relays
to the generator rooms

  the whine of the generators rose and
the needle on the acceleration master
dial rose with it trehearne watched it
with bulging eyes gasping under the
pressure barely restrained an impulse
to scream the second officer was clutch-
ing his chair his face white

  joris watched the dial at the precise
instant he punched the relay bars again
the needle ceased to blur in its frantic
ascent climbing now with a decent
deliberation

  joris turned around he looked at his
companions and shook with laughter
he had for the first time since tre-
hearne had known him the face of a
completely happy man

  trehearne staggered up he got out
a handkerchief and wiped his face
there was blood on it as well as sweat
well he said were off but if you
dont mind telling me now joris-
where the devil are we off to

  hm said joris this may seem a
little peculiar to you in view of all the
circumstances-

  he roared again with hearty mirth
ill tell you trehearne were off t
thuvis
	startling stories

chapter xiii
bitter planet

trehearne stared at joris a
small trickle of blood ran from his
nose down over his lip he forgot to
wipe it away

  youre joking he said

  not at all it was edri who an-
swered he had come into the bridge
behind trehearne he cried good-na-
turedly blast you joris what are you
trying to do-kill us all before we get
started 

  theyll be after us soon enough
said joris we need all the edge we can
get

  trehearne demanded why are we
going to thuvis

  partly said edri soberly to res-
cue the men who are rotting away out
there but chiefly because we must have
arrin you see trehearne he was ar-
rested before he could finish his calcula-
tions when i tried to carry on i added
a good bit of my own material-but the
missing factor isnt there arrin has it
he must have or he couldnt have gone
as far as he did now if we put our
knowledge together-

  edri sighed its been a long long
fight a thousand years of piecing to-
gether lie and legend and hearsay of
hunting down scraps of letters and
secret reports of dredging through
tons of irrelevant nonsense in search of
one little bit of truth

  the vardda authorities of that day
suppressed or destroyed all evidence
connected with that last voyage of
orthis they did their work well until
now no one has even known in what
general sector of the galaxy the pur-
suit took place

  yes a long fight and if were wrong
it means the end of hope in our genera-
tion others will have to begin the
search all over again

  it seemed a cruel question to ask but
trehearne could not keep from it

  is there any proof that orthis ship
still exists at all

  no we only know that it was not
destroyed at the time that orthis out-
ran his pursuers and disappeared long
afterward one of the life-skiffs of his
ship was picked up in space he had
known it could only be picked up by his
enemies so there was nothing inside it
but a message painted large on the walls
-you have not destroyed me the peo-
ples of the galaxy shall yet be given the
freedom of the stars

  trehearne shook his head orthis
must have been quite a man

  he was said joris a true man
of the stars he was born in deep space
between aldebaran and the little yellow
sun that is our nearest neighbor he was
one of the last of the four generations
of men and women who made the first
xound-trip voyage of all time into inter-
stellar space

  edri nodded he was only twenty
when the ship returned to llyrdis but
spending his whole life in space had
made him strange he could not endure
to be planet-bound he built his labora-
tory ship and worked in it almost alone
for another fifteen years and then an-
nounced his great discovery-the muta-
tion the birth of galactic man

  he never gave out the whole secret
of his process he said it was too dan-
gerous in untrained hands he built the
whole apparatus himself and handled
it himself and sowed with his own
hands the seed of the vardda race that
would flower in the next generation

  he was revered almost as a demigod
at first but there were the other planets
of aldebaran there were the worlds of
the neighboring yellow sun inhabited
by peoples of a high culture orthis
assumed that they too were going to be
included in the great new future of
star-travel-they and all other star-
worlds truly civilized enough to be
worthy of it

  well there were objections to that
chiefest and soundest of them was the
fear of terrible interstellar wars two
parties sprang up and fiercely argued
the question orthis laboratory ship
the starmen of llyrdis	

was impounded and he himself was kept
virtually a prisoner for many years in
the end his cause was defeated and his
ship ordered destroyed

 orthis succeeded in escaping with
his partys help he got his ship away
it looked as though he would be vic-
torious after all but by this time the
new vardda race had begun to flourish
and some of them were old enough to
fly so these young wolves believing in-
tensely in their right haled out after
the old man who clung just as intensely
to his own beliefs

 he was undoubtedly able to endure
ultra-speeds himself for it was a long
and bitter chase they partially disabled
his ship but even so he managed to elude
them there was no ultra-wave radar or
radio in those early days and after all he
had cut his teeth on the stars they
lost him and that was the end of orthis
and his ship except for the life-skiffs
message he was never heard of again
edri paused then added do you
wonder that we venerate such a man
i think said trehearne slowly
that you have his kind of courage
maybe edri laughed i do know i
have a most colossal thirst you didnt
forget the wine stores joris

  the gods forbid

  lets go and drink edri took tre-
hearnes arm and you can tell me a
story-where you came from and what
in blazes youre doing here

  no said trehearne without relish
i think id better see about shairn
edris jaw dropped shairn

 yes unfortunately-shairn he ex-
plained rapidly how the extra passenger
came aboard

edri said some low hard words
that isnt going to help matters
one little bit we can hardly leave her
on thuvis and we cant stop anywhere
else

  it couldnt be helped growled joris
no well i think ill go with you
trehearne i dont believe youd be safe
alone

  they found her locked in an officers
cabin for which on this short-handed

trip there was no officer she was still
bound and gagged from the look she
gave them trehearne thought she
would have killed them both if she had
the power

  he freed her she sat up on the bunk
rubbing her wrists two red marks
ran from the corners of her mouth
across her white cheeks where the gag
had rubbed it gave her a comical ex-
pression like the mask of a clown
there was nothing comical about her
eyes

  she did not speak

  trehearne said awkwardly shairn
im sorry about all this but you might
as well make the best of it now youre
here

  still she did not speak she only sat
and looked at him

  edri said come on shairn a glass
of wine will do you good

  she ignored him silence and the
green deadly eyes fixed on trehearne

  he went to her and put his hand on
her shoulder be reasonable shairn
i know how you feel but none of it was
done with intent and were all your
friends whether you agree with us or
not

  he jerked back but not quite in time
her claws raked his cheek he stepped
away she sat motionless and said not
one word

  trehearne swung on his heel and
went out edri came after him and
locked the door perhaps joris can talk
to her he said his tone did not hold
much hope

  oh shell come out of it said tre-
hearne nobody can stay that mad for-
ever

  edri shook his head ive known her
longer than you have i wouldnt count
on it

 the intercom boomed over their
heads-joris calling from the bridge

  edri-will you and trehearne step
up here the bad news is starting to
come in

  communications was just abaft the
bridge joris had relinquished the con-
trols to the second and was standing
in the cramped space behind the opera-
	startling stories

tor listening intently to the thin metal-
lic voice that came from the ultra-wave
receiver

  channel one-alert all ships in
sector m    request radar confirma-
tion on ship believed on course as fol-
lows  

  port radar base would have got our
coordinates at take-off of course said
joris theyre just making sure

  listen said edri

  the metallic voice finished repeating
the coordinates it went on all ships
xoiu identify immediately when chal-
lenged all ships will identify   

  cruisers said edri

  joris frowned they could man at
least one in a hurry i told you wed
need a head start

  he returned to the bridge to inspect
the dials and order the generators
stepped up

  well have to reach acceleration
peak in half the normal time or we
might as well have stayed on llyrdis
im going to see what radar has turned
up

  trehearne followed along brooding
on the subject of cruisers the vardda
had no warships being in the enviable
position of having no use for them but
the council maintained a small fleet of
armed craft with maximum velocities
considerably above those of the slower
cargo ships for the purpose of keeping
down occasional outbursts of illegal
trading among the vardda themselves

  the three-dimensional radar screens
showed the normal number of tiny red
sparks-the faster-than-light energy
impulses of ships generators joris
scanned them with a practiced eye

  nothing to bother us yet too early
to tell-the sector immediately behind
us is too crowded with shipping from
the port he turned to the technician
keep a damn sharp lookout astern call
me the minute you see anything unusual
youre on a twelve-hour shift and ill
arrange for your relief

  relief was a problem on that voyage
no one got much of it they had slightly
over half the number of men required
lor a full crew under normal circum-

stances and some of them were not
trained technicians trehearne found
himself doing one eight-hour trick on
the bridge calling out dial readings and
another in communications since
obviously there was no sending to be
done he could handle the receiver well
enough

  channel one which was the official
top-priority voice of the vardda council
continued to request-and get-confir-
mation of their course

  it was not long before quorn their
communications officer reported that
radar showed a red spark astern that
seemed to be following their course

calculating distance by inten-
sity it was possible to judge the
rate of approach joris demanded more
thrust from the generators ignoring the
shuddering agony of the hull and the
equally painful reactions of his men

  until we pick up arrin he said
its got to be cut and run thuvis is the
first place theyll block off and anything
but a direct course on our part will giv
them time to do it

  they reached their acceleration peak
-maximum stress for the fabric of the
ship joris pushed it over they prayed

  the observation port began to show
a thinning star-field ahead wider and
wider the areas of darkness spread and
the colonies of suns were fewer and
more scattered the red sparks on the
radar screens dwindled and faded until
only two or three were left-lonely
traders outbound to these isloated sys-
tems ttiose-and the single spark that
brightened always astern

  the hours became a lagging monot-
ony of constant watching constant
strain numb from lack of sleep tre-
hearne went mechanically through his
duties forgot even to worry about what
was going to happen yesterday was an
eon ago tomorrow was lost in nothing-
ness there was only today and he was
tired

  it was the same with all of them
joris seemed neither more nor less ex-
hausted than the rest and trehearne
marveled at the old mans strength
the starmen of llyrdis	

  shairne remained locked in her cabin
she would not speak to anyone except
the youngster who brought her food
then only to voice a curt thanks

 ahead the darkness deepened the
main axis of the milky way plane was
below them beyond the isolated sys-
tems they could glimpse the lightless
gulf of utter emptiness its black blank-
ness afflicted trehearne with a creeping
horror it was like seeing the primal
chaos before creation

  at last a dim red sun was centered in
the field it began to grow the radar
screens were empty save for the one
grim following spark that had become
almost a flame ominously bright

  joris made his calculations and again
they prayed

  they completed deceleration in a little
less than half the normal time that
was the period during which no one ate
and only those who had to remained
erect

  thuvis hung in the sky before them
an idiot sun devouring the last of its
strength and peering with a dull red eye
at the cosmic face of death it was
circled by a single world

  well have to make it fast said
joris harshly you be ready edri

  the mirzim landed on an arid table-
land swept by bitter winds quorn stayed
to maintain his tense vigil at the radar
screens but the rest of them went out
glad of solid ground if only for a few
minutes

 the wind-driven dust tore at tre-
hearne cutting into his flesh like tiny
cold knives the sky was dusky at mid-
day but there were few stars even at
night there would be few stars here

  the sullen glare of thuvis washed
the dusty desert world with red and
where a deep ravine cleft the tableland
the shadows clung like clotted blood
trehearne could not think of a place
that more resembled hell

  edri had hastened to the lip of the
ravine trehearne followed and looked
down below the steep sides below the
ugly screens was a tangle of pallid vege-
tation stunted trees and leprous shrub-
bery clustered around warm springs

that smoked like little fumaroles in the
chill air there was a settlement here
three or four small plastic structures
surrounded by a wall outside the wall a
pathetic expanse of tilled land

  theyre coming cried edri they
saw the ship   

  a narrow path led steeply up from
the ravine men were already toiling
along it trehearne counted them eight
ten eleven-eleven men the total popu-
lation of this world of ultimate exile

  edri was shouting his voice echoed
back and forth in the ravine with a
hollow booming sound other shouts
answered him the men on the path be-
gan to run they slipped and staggered
in their haste clawing their way up-
ward trehearne could see their white
faces strained toward him

  he watched them come-gaunt wind-
bitten hopeless men with the greyness
of living death upon them striving up
from that deep red-lit prison answer-
ing the call of edris voice he saw their
eyes the eyes of men called back sud-
denly from that terrible numbing of the
mind that is worse than clean destruc-
tion

  edri threw his arms around the man
who came first over the rim he had not
been there as long as the others and the
stamp was not so deep on him he
turned and shouted at his mates to
hurry his beard and his unkempt hair
blew in the wind and his voice was wild

  edri cried to him no time for talk
now arrin is that all of you

  it was the line of bearded scare-
crows hastened toward the mirzim
ready hands helped them in

  the voice of quorn yelled over the
intercom theyre right on top of us
hurry it up

  joris had thrust his way forward to
the bridge he was at his station and
waiting before the port was closed

  ready foi take-off watch your-
selves 

  his hand reached out for the signal
relays and then trehearne saw it hesi-
tate and fall back

  from the opening door of the com-
munications room another voice spoke
	startling stories

perfectly audible at that short distance
-the metallic voice of the receiver

  we have your range do not attempt
to take off we have your range do not
attempt   

  over joris suddenly shrunken shoul-
ders through the bridge port trehearne
saw the long slim shape of a cruiser
sweep in toward a landing close beside
them

chapter xiv
toward the shores of night

kerrels face appeared on the
small screen there was no need
now for the ultra-wave and the ordinary
visiphone unit had been cut in edri
and joris confronted him trehearne
stood in the doorway listening behind
him were the rescued exiles and black
despair was on them all

  kerrel regarded edri and joris with
weary hatred he seemed to have learned
that being an agent of the council had
its rough side but there was no slight-
est hint of leniency in his tone

  the gun crew has orders to open
fire in exactly fifteen minutes he said
you have that long to clear your ship
bringing with you neither weapons nor
personal gear of any sort he repeated
fifteen minutes precisely

  joris looked at him with red and
sunken eyes twenty years of age had
come upon him in the last few minutes
he could not seem to bring himself to
speak edris hands were clenched so
tightly that the fingers were bone white
they moved back and forth seeking
something to strike and not finding it
he too had become old

  fourteen minutes said kerrel
without emotion youre wasting
time

  edri turned abruptly and thrust his
way blindly past trehearne who caught
and held him in the doorway

  let go said edri viciously and
cursed him that ravine is deep i can

step off into it now as well as later i
wont be taken back

  hold on said trehearne a sudden
wild hope had come to him he lifted his
voice kerrel kerrel can you hear
me he was out of visual range of the
screen

  yes trehearne i hear you

  then listen tell your men to hold
their fire we have shairn aboard
joris head came up sharply edri
stopped fighting and in the screen ker-
rels mirrored face went through the
shadings of surprise shock then under-
standing and a wry mirth

  you have a quick mind trehearne
he said but it wont do thirteen min-
utes

  go and get her edri said tre-
hearne his mouth was dry his body
drenched with cold sweat

  edri plunged away into the corridor
trehearne went and stood where kerrel
could see him he smiled and wondered
if kerrel could hear the knocking of his
heart against his ribs

  joris stood motionless waiting ker-
rel counted off the minutes and at each
count his voice became more strained
his eyes less certain

  there were six minutes left when
edri came back with shairn and thrust
her in front of the screen

  you see said trehearne i wasnt
lying

  kerrel forgot to count he stared at
the girl the strong lines of his face
crumbling into indecision he said her
name once suddenly he turned and was
gone from the screen they could hear
him shouting somewhere beyond hold
your fire hold your fire they have a
prisoner aboard

  trehearne knew then that he had not
misjudged the depth of the others pas-
sion and strangely that knowledge was
bitter to him

  kerrel came into view again and
shairn cried out kerrel theyre after
something more than these orthist
exiles i think theyre-

  trehearne put his hand over her
mouth it doesnt matter what she
thinks the only important thing is her
the starmen of llyrdis	

life how much is it worth to you ker-
rel r

  kerrel ran his hand nervously over
his face and did not answer at once
trehearne kept his palm firmly on
shairns mouth

  kerrel shook his head you wouldnt
kill her trehearne

  no i wouldnt trehearne said
but im only one and there are others
aboard eleven men of thuvis who feel
that one life is very little to pay for
escape from this hell-hole come on
kerrel how much is shairn worth to
you you can have her-free clear and
alive

  kerrel asked what do you want
  a head start

  it wont do you any good you cant
outrun a cruiser

  joris said well take that chance
again kerrel hesitated what are
your terms

  trehearne said you will allow us
to take off and well guarantee to land
shairn safely on the other side of this
planet you will keep your ship here
until you receive our message that that
has been done we will both be able
to check each others actions by radar
and if your generators are started be-
fore our second take-off well know it
kerrel gnawed his lip and then asked
sullenly what assurance have i that
you will actually release her

 you can take my word for that
trehearne told him either that or
blow her to bits with the rest of us
there was another long tense moment
of silence and then kerrel said all
right he spoke the words as though
they had a taste of vitriol on his tongue

  joris was out of communications in
one long stride kerrel looked at shairn
and cried wait you must radio your
position when you set her down

  we will

  trehearne flipped the switch the
screen went blank the throbbing gener-
ators took the ship and lifted it and
whirled it away and no gun spoke from
the cruiser trehearne released his grip
on shairn reaction and relief had
turned his knees to water so that it was

difficult to stand against the lurching
of the ship

  shairn turned and looked at him
youre a fool michael she said but
ill give you this youre not a coward

he had her locked in her cabin again
and went back to the bridge joris
was scowling at the projection of the
microfilm chart of the planet

  there he said and pointed to a
huge emptiness shell be safe there
until they pick her up-theres no pred-
atory life in these deserts he glanced
up at trehearne good man he said
me i was beaten

  trehearne gave him a wry smile
me i bluffed from here on joris its
all yours wheres edri

  shut in his cabin with arrin they
know the general sector clear out at the
galaxys edge now theyre trying to
figure out the true course together
and joris snorted course if i can
keep one jump ahead of that cruiser ill
be satisfied

  the mirzim skimmed over the dark-
ling world of thuvis into the starless
night trehearne sat and brooded think-
ing of shairn thinking of the two men
who were bent over the final calcula-
tions of a dream that had balked men
for a thousand years

  he thought of what a dream can do
to a man of how far it can lead him
away from the good safe life of common
sense to the ultimate voids of creation
he hoped that edri and arrin would
find what they wanted he hoped they
would live to find it

  coming down said joris better
get shairn a coverall its cold there
trehearne found a warm coverall in
the equipment locker and took it to
shairns cabin she put it on and he
saw how her face was shadowed by
weariness and strain

  she said quietly do you still love
me michael

  her question took him by surprise
and the answer came of itself yes
he said i do

  then we must stop behaving like
two angry children and not throw awaf
	startling stories

the life we can have together

  he bent his head im sorry you got
caught in this

  its as much my fault as yours i
was too quick to lose my temper i should
have stopped to think that the vardda
world was so new to you that you had
little to judge it by

  she was not now the mocking shairn
of old her voice was full of a sombre
passion a pleading for him to under-
stand

  michael your motives were good-
devotion to a friend reaction against
what seemed to you injustice but surely
now you must see how hopeless this all
is i know youre hunting orthis ship
youll never reach it kerrel will run
you down itll all have been for noth-
ing

  it seemed to trehearne that what she
said was very likely true but he only
answered its too late to think about
that now

  no michael you can still save your-
self she caught him by the shoulders
her hands urgent on his flesh her
touch could still do things to him leave
the ship with me let kerrel pick us
both up

  trehearne smiled mirthlessly ker-
rel would like that-taking me back to
a prison

  it doesnt have to be prison shairn
exclaimed you can say you pretended
to join joris and edri only to save me
ill back you up and not kerrel nor any-
one else can disprove it youll walk out
free on llyrdis

  it crossed his mind that he could do
that it would all fit it was an out

  you wont be letting your friends
down either shairn insisted theyll
go on without you youve done all you
can for them

  she clung to him her mouth begged
him with a silent language of its own

  he took her arms slowly from around
him and thrust her back and she caught
her breath at the pain of his grip

 no he said and again no
shairn

  she stood back and looked at him
steadily you could go back to the sil-

ver tower with me but you wont-and
for what so that peoples youve never
met on worlds youll never see can some-
day fly the stars 

  there was a man named trehearne
on the world earth who got his chance
to fly the stars he said i thought
that others should have their chance
too i have to play it out now

  she was silent and then the dropping
speed of the ship told them that it was
almost over trehearne took her down
to the airlock chamber they stood there
together not finding anything more to
say and all that had been between them
came silently and mocked them with the
pain of vanished days

  the mirzim scraped her keel softly
on a yielding surface and was still
trehearne opened the port looking out
on the dark windy desert

  shairn spoke then a strange begin-
ning for us michael and now an even
stranger ending you told me once i
would be sorry i ever met you i am
he held out his hand to help her
down and the pressure of her fingers
was like something tearing at his heart

  she looked up at him a small lonely
figure in the vast dark he thought her
lips moved but the wind came between
them and took the words away and he
had none of his own for answer

  the warning bell jarred harshly in
his ears he closed the port and she
was gone

  joris voice roared from the bridge
through the intercom flatten out all
this is the only start well get on kerrel
and ive got to pile it on

  the cruel hand of acceleration crushed
trehearne down he lay on the scored
plates of the deck and that last vision
of shairns white face remained with
him to remind him of all that he had had
and lost

  he said her name over and over in
the silence of the empty lock and his
mouth was filled with the bitter taste of
dust the mirzim leaped through space
like a wild thing driving toward the
sector that was the goal of a thousand-
year hope and quest toward the galaxy
edge and the shore of outer night
the starmen

       chapter xv
       world of death

they had stepped clear out to the
edge of the galaxy where the fring-
ing stars were lost in the outer void and
the dead suns swept forever through the
entombing dark where even the mem-
ory of creation was gone blotted out
by unimaginable time

 trehearne tried to remember how
long it had been since they had taken
off from thuvis he gave it up it didnt
matter he peered with aching blood-
shot eyes into the lightless seas that lie
between the island universes and tried
to remember why he had come here
and that too was dim in his mind

 edri was bent over a table that had
been set up in the bridge he no longer
looked like edri he seemed to have
been working for a million years arrin
sat near him he held his head between
his bony hands a bearded mummy em-
balmed upright hardly retaining the
semblance of life

  there were charts under edris hands
endless sheets of calculations endless
miles of figures joris studied them
bending beside edri his broad jowls
hung down now over his wrinkled col-
lar his eyes had sunk deep under ridges
of bone peering out as from two shad-
owed caves

  edri was talking in a voice that came
from far away the words reached tre-
hearne in droning snatches from beyond
the fog of weariness

 -so our only way to locate orthis
ship was to triangulate its position from
two separate bearings on it one bear-
ing was the course of that life-skiff
orthis sent in with his last message
allowing for aberrations caused by the
gravitational field of stars the other
bearing was orthis course in his last
flight we couldnt get that till i found
the part of the lankar manuscript that
arrin didnt have

 trehearne heard someone ask who

of llyrdis	

was lankar

  one of orthis last pursuers who
left a secret log of the pursuit to ease
his guilty conscience enough of it sur-
vived-

  joris said the hell with lankar
get on with it

  we had to push the star-maps back
in time-galactic motion star stream-
ing a million complicated problems of
relative motion and proper motion back
five hundred years and then another
five hundred and then correlate them
that works been going on a long long
time

  edri drew a long breath that was
coupled with a racking yawn

  the charts indicate an unnamed
dark star following an orbit here out-
side the main stream of the galaxy he
traced a line with his finger these
charts for the fringing stars are incom-
plete as you know theres nothing to
draw anyone out to these godforsaken
regions and theyve never been properly
explored

  but according to our calculations
that star was in the right place a thou-
sand years ago and orthis life-skiff was
launched from there now the wheel of
the galaxy has turned so taking the
dark star with it   

  he laid his hand on the crossing of
two marked lines on the chart thats
our destination joris if were right
the ship of orthis is there if were
wrong-well somebody else will have
to try again in another thousand years

  he remained standing silent his
hands braced on the table too tired to
move joris rubbed his bleary eyes and
began to read the coordinates aloud from
the chart mechanically the second offi-
cer set up the combination on the finder

  joris moved heavily back to the pilot
chair he set the mirzim on her new
course then he spoke over the intercom
to radar whats the position of the
cruiser 

  a croaking voice answered him he
listened closer he said always
closer

  trehearnes mind turned back to its
constant half-walcing nightmare the
t	startling stories

cruiser following hanging on dogged
persistent relentless he lived over pain-
fully every maneuver every trick by
which joris had managed to delay their
pursuer to grasp a little more time a
little more distance

 he remembered the last-minute
plunge into a dark nebula when the
cruiser was almost close enough to
range them he remembered the turn-
ing and twisting and doubling inside the
blackness of the cloud where the ab-
sorptive cosmic dust fogged the radar
they had lost the cruiser there they
had got clear away and for a time they
had hoped they had made it to this
fringe sector-and then the red spark
showed again on the screen coming
closer always closer

  there were times when trehearne
forgot the physical fact of the cruiser
a ship of ordinary metal officered and
manned by ordinary vardda spacemen
at such times it seemed to him that the
mirzim was pursued by a demoniac
nemesis btriding naked across the plung-
ing gulfs-a nemesis wearing kerrels
face with kerrels hands outstretched to
grasp them

  sometimes shairns face was there
beside kerrels white unreadable a
misty cloud that blotted out the stars

  the hoarse voice of the radar man
croaked at intervals the ship fled on
toward the dark star

  joris turned around the table had
been taken out the charts and the toil-
some calculations rolled up and shoved
away arrin lay on the deck against the
after bulkhead sleeping he would not
leave the bridge until he knew whether
or not his life and work had gone for
nothing edri sat beside him he was
not asleep

  joris said flatly it isnt going to
work

  edri said nothing he waited

  joris went on as though he hated
what he was saying but had to say it
look at it as soon as i start decelera-
tion the cruiser will begin to cut our
lead to nothing and theyre stressed
for less deceleration time than i can
make without tearing the mirzim to

pieces whatll happen theyll be on us
before we can even begin our search
edri nodded he leaned back against
the bulkhead and closed his eyes he
said they know now what were after
what do you suppose kerrel would do
if he found the ship of orthis

nobody answered that there was
no need to answer a heavy silence
followed during which trehearne
thought of the messages that had gone
out across the galaxy from the cruisers
ultra-wave-guarded messages that be-
trayed by their very spareness the des-
perate nature of this mission urgent
requests for other council cruisers to
close up with all speed

  the others were still too far away to
matter whatever happened would have
happened before they could come up
kerrel was going to finish this alone
edri said what are we going to do
joris rubbed his big hand over his
stubbled face and blinked and said
our only chance if orthis ship and
secret are really there is to get the
ultra-wave equipment to it in time for
what we planned

  he went on slowly i think the life-
skiff could carry that equipment if we
drop the skiff it would travel on con-
stant velocity for a while before it would
have to decelerate meanwhile i could
swing the mirzim on another course
running back along the rim of the gal-
axy away from the dark star the cruis-
er would follow me chances are with
their radar concentrated on me to
catch my lateral-impulse pattern they
wouldnt notice the skiff at all when she
started deceleration

  he sighed theyd catch us of
course but the mirzim isnt going to
keep on forever after the beating shes
taken the generators are in bad shape
but we could keep going long enough
to give you time

  edri thought it over i dont like it
he said but it looks as though its that
or nothing

  joris was muttering under his breath
about maximum loads and capacity
the main ultra-wave equipment he
the starmen of llyrdis	

said and three men the skiff would
take that wed keep the auxiliary ultra-
wave set here of course

  who can you spare youll need all
your flight technicians

  he can spare me said trehearne
im the most nonessential and i can
still stand up if i have to

  joris nodded yes quorn has to go
to handle the ultra-wave of course-and
he can handle the skiff all right

  who else

  you said joris

  edri looked at the sleeping arrin
he ought to go instead hes worked
for it longer than i have it was obvi-
ous that arrin was unable to go any-
where and edri sighed he pulled him-
self erect all right then come on
trehearne well start loading

  the skiff was contained in a cell of
its own sunk in the side of the mirzim-
a miniature starship with a flight range
long enough to give the crew of a dis-
abled ship a chance to reach safety

  trehearne routed out every man that
was off-station and could stand erect
following edris orders he stripped the
skiff of everything they wouldnt need
quorn oversaw the removal of the heavy
ultra-wave radio equipment from the
mirzim and its loading into the skiff he
seemed unnecessarily particular about
it trehearne swore and sweated but
got it done

  he went back up to the bridge with
edri and quorn joris studied his in-
struments

  pretty soon he said he gave quorn
his flight instructions trehearne is
still a lubber he remarked but he
knows enough by now to give you a
hand when you need it

 edri said surrender as soon as
youre challenged joris

  joris laughed a pallid ghost of his
old loud roar i will right now im
too tired to die he glanced again at
the instruments time to go

  they looked at each other these fa-
tigue-drunken red-eyed men whom a
dream had dragged to the edge of the
universe and could find nothing to say
ia this moment of their parting

  good luck muttered edri then and
turned away

  youre the ones whore going to need
it joris called after them

  trehearne went through after quorn
and edri into the skiff quorn took its
controls and waited watching his chro-
nometer his hand grasped loosely about
a red-switch marked release

  he closed the switch

  there was a squeal and grind of ma-
chinery an instant of extreme pressure
then the skiff had left the mirzim
though they could not see they knew
that skiff and ship had already diverged
far apart at their unthinkable speeds

  quorn watched his instruments while
trehearne and edri sat looking at noth-
ing afraid to sleep lest they should not
be able to wake again

  presently quorn started his forward
generator and began deceleration

  trehearne lost track of things part
of the following time he was unconscious
or nearly so the rest of it he observed
as in a confused dream he thought of
how he had once been wild for starflight
but he managed to do the things that
quorn required of him

  the port cleared it had no adapter
and functioned as a port only at visual
speeds now ahead of them trehearne
could see a huge bulk of darkness
against the outer dark illumined only
faintly by the galactic light

  there it is said edri the dark
star his voice shook a little

  they swept closer still slowing down
it has a planet said quorn there
catching the starshine-

  two said trehearne i see two

two dimly gleaming bodies dead
worlds clinging to a long dead sun
out here at galaxy edge the glow of
the milky way touched them the ghost-
ly glow of candles at a wake

  edri whispered well try the outer
planet first give me a hand tre-
hearne

  they crawled aft between the crowd-
ed banks of equipment to a detector
that had come from the mirzims hold
edri fumbled at it
	startling stories

  in orthis day they used radioactive
fuel of course edri mumbled we cal-
culated its half-life even supposing his
bunkers were nearly empty there should
be enough left to register on this count-
er a teacupful would do it

  trehearne helped edri adjust the
shielding apparatus on the mechanism
until the needle was still

  what about radioactive deposits on
the planets themselves he asked

  we get a break there too old the
last radioactive element will have died
millions of years ago

  he raised his voice keep the skiff
as low as you dare quorn the counter
has a wide sweep take it slow

  he crouched over the telltale tre-
hearne moved forward again

  the planet was small less than two
thousand miles in diameter between
the intense gloom and the motion of the
skiff he could see nothing but a black
featureless desolation rifted here and
there with white that he took to be the
frozen remains of an atmosphere he
thought what it would be like to land
there and shivered

  they swept the planet carefully the
telltale needle of the counter remained
motionless edri said heavily well go
on pray we find it on the other planet
pray orthis didnt come down on the
dead star it would take forever to find
him there

  quorn fed in power and cleared away
the port dimmed again and edri
moaned

  hes about out quorn said looks
like whatever is done well have to do
the most of it

  the second world was larger than the
first by three times or more it was not
content to be featureless it thrust up
gnawed and shattered ranges stripped
bones of mountains sheathed in frozen
gases it showed forth dreary plains
coated white with congealed air glisten-
ing faintly in the light of the great
galactic wheel

  it turned toward the watchers the
naked beds of its vanished oceans
sucked dry to the deepest gulf it dis-
played the scars of its long dying the

brutal wounds of internal explosion the
riven gashes of a shrinking crust a
hideous world that seemed to remember
beauty still and resent the cruelty of
death

  edri whispered pray-pray that the
damned thing moves instead of doing
so he cursed the needle that it did not
stir

  keep going said trehearne

  they kept going

  the needle quivered

  edri let out a hoarse cry easy
easy tears began to run down his
cheeks he sobbed the needle jerked

  circle trehearne shouted to
quorn circle till we get it centered

  he ran his tongue over his lips and
tasted salt and wondered how it got
there

  quorn swung the skiff around in a
tightening spiral now said edri
let her down

  he scrambled forward thrusting his
face against the port trying to see
quorn switched on a landing light the
blue-white blaze lit up a circular area
below the light intensely bright the
shadows intensely black its beam went
sharply down

  they followed it it was as though the
skiff were poised on that pillar of light
sinking downward

  they were above a planetary surface
racked and tortured by final diastro-
phism towering miles high loomed a
mighty cliff of riven rock in front of it
a chasm yawned and beyond the chasm
a drear and tumbled landscape stretched
dim under the great sword of the galaxy

  they started down along the face of
the titanic cliff looking at the chasm
at its base trehearne began to get un-
easy

  theres no ship here he said the
counter must have picked up some last
radiation from deep down in that
chasm

  quorn agreed with him but edri
said no keep going trehearne could
feel him tremble

  they went on down the face of the
giant looming wall

  trehearne pointed suddenly isnt
the starmen of llyrdis	

that a ledge

  the hard bright edge of the beam cut
across a shelf of rock that jutted out
halfway down the cliff quorn swung
the skiff in closer something on the
ledge glistened dully under the light

  quorn let the skiff drop with a sicken-
ing rush detail sprang clear-shat-
tered rock ancient magma puddles of
frozen air in the hollows and among
them an ovoid shape symmetrical
smooth giving back a metallic glint

 edri said the name of orthis as
though it were a prayer

       chapter xvi
       the star-born

fcuorn had set the skiff down on
 the ledge they had scrambled into
pressure suits they had forgotten that
they were already three-quarters dead

  awkward in the clumsy armor stum-
bling on the jagged rock slipping on
the patches of frozen air they clawed
their way toward the goal they had
crossed a galaxy and gambled their lives
to find above them the ghastly cliff
leaned outward against nothingness
below them the abyss plunged down into
the dead heart of a world beyond them
was spreading desolation and in the
black sky the awful rim of the galaxy
lay like a blazing sword of light

  trehearne was aware of the silence
he had never been on an airless world
before he felt the impact as his metal
boot struck against a shard of rock but
it made no sound all he could hear was
the harsh breathing of quorn and edri
transmitted to him by the helmet audio

 the ship of orthis loomed before
them lightless lifeless cradled in the
ashes of destruction it had a look of
patience it had lain here waiting for
a thousand years untouched by time or
rust entombed in silence and the end-
less night eternal as the dead suns that
rove forever in uncorrupting space it
seemed that it could wait until the end

of time cherishing its trust

  awe came upon trehearne and with
it a kind of fear

  they found the lock port it stood
wide open the valves still clean and
shining the light of trehearnes belt-
lamp showed him on the floor of the
lock chamber the scored marks of a
mans boots they might have been made
only yesterday

  the three men paused outside that
open port they looked at each other
through their glassite helmets and their
faces were strange then trehearne
stepped aside and quorn also edri bent
his head he moved forward to the port

  silently he clambered into the ship of
orthis

  the others were close behind him
their belt lamps cut hard slashes of
light across the dark they passed
through the lock chamber and came
into a corridor running fore and aft it
was utterly still the heavy drag of their
boots on the metal deck made not the
slightest sound trehearne could hear
the beating of his own blood in his ears
the dull throbbing of his heart

  the whole after section of the ship
was a laboratory much of the delicate
equipment was shattered either by
speed-vibration or a hard landing tre-
hearne could not make sense out of any
of it but quorn said he was studying
interstellar radiation most of that stuff
is beyond me but i can see that much

  one section of the laboratory con-
tained a complicated mass of coils and
prisms and intricate banks of reflectors
arranged around what must have been
a great central tube there was a small
platform at the focal point of the mech-
anism fitted with straps along one
bulkhead was a stack of metal cages for
experimental animals several of the
little creatures were still there they
had died the quick death of airlessness
and cold but their bodies were still per-
fect they had then survived the voy-
age

  edris voice came over the helmet
audio nothing for us here he said
no good trying to figure out this appa-
ratus-they couldnt do that in all the
	startling stories

years they had the ship impounded most
of it orthis designed and built himself

  trehearne was still looking at the
small furry bodies in the cages lying
as though in sleep somehow they made
the betrayal of orthis and his dream
doubly cruel-that even beasts could be
given the freedom of the stars that so
many generations of the races of many
worlds had been denied

  he turned and went forward with
the others they glanced into the living
quarters they were small and spare
the coverings of the bunk were rum-
pled and the pillow still retained the
hollow where a mans head had lain
trehearne shivered they passed on to
the bridge

  trehearne realized then what an act
of heroism it had been to push this
antique ship to the limits of the galaxy
and beyond the instruments were so
few and rudimentary the system of con-
trols so crude there was a locking de-
vice an iron mike that could keep the
ship on its course without human atten-
tion the science of starflight had come
a long way since then

  he remembered that this craft had
not been built for starflight but rather
as a spatial laboratory and he won-
dered that it had survived at all

there was a door in the after bulk-
head of the bridge he went to it
and looked through into the cabin be-
yond the beam of his belt lamp speared
brightly into the immemorial dark

  trehearne uttered a hoarse cry the
others ran to him he was clinging to
the bulkhead then the cold sweat pour-
ing down his face his eyes staring they
looked past him over his shoulder

  the cabin was small it was fitted as
a library crammed with metal cases of
books some of them microfilm volumes
of an ancient type others thick ragged
notebooks there was a great table bolt-
ed down and on the table was a metal
box

  behind the table was a man

  he sat in a metal chair his right arm
was outstretched clenched fist resting
squarely on the metal box as though de-

manding that it be noticed his head
was lifted looking toward the glassite
port that showed the black sky slashed
across with the mighty fires of the
galaxy

  he was an old man the years of his
life had not been kind to him they had
shaped his face as though from dark
iron gouging the lines deep hammer-
ing the ridges hard driving out all
traces of youth and hope to forge a mask
of bitter anger and reproach and in the
end despair

  it seemed to trehearne that he could
read a whole life history in that face
caught forever in the moment of death
when surely the man was crying out
upon whatever gods he worshipped de-
manding why

  edri made a strange harsh sound in
his throat orthis he whispered or-
this for a moment i thought  

  so did i trehearne admitted he
does look alive all right

  here in the airless utter cold death
held no decay no change but there was
more to it than the lack of physical
corruption the fire in this man had
burned so deep that even death could
not erase its scars

  i think said trehearne that he
wanted whoever found him to look in-
side that box he suddenly wanted to
get away from this funeral ship

  they went in and he reached out and
tried to move orthis hand from off the
box the arm was frozen rigid as a steel
bar trehearne gave it up and worked
the box out from under it

  it was unlocked he lifted up the lid
the lamplight showed a notebook bound
in cloth on top of it lay a loose sheet
of paper with a few angular lines of
writing edri read aloud

   i have clung to life this much long-
er to write down for the first time all
my formulae complete and simplified
so that they can be understood and used
in them lies the freedom of the stars i
the first of the star-born was rejected
by the greed and fear of the planet-born
before but it will not be always so  

   i shall not see what comes my ship
has already flown too far i have littla
the starmen of llyrdis	

fuel and i am old therefore i have set
the airlock control and in a few minutes
it will open a swift death and better
than a slow one

   after that i shall wait what i
dreamed will never be forgotten some-
day will come others who believe as i do
that the stars are for all men 

  edri fell silent and then he whis-
pered he watched the galaxy for a
thousand years and waited

  trehearne forced himself to break
the spell we only have a little time
he warned he shut the box this is
what you need lets go

  they went out of the silent ship tre-
hearne looked up at the flaming river of
stars in the sky and thought what a
mighty dream the first of star-born men
had carried with him into the long night

  he began to run toward the skiff
holding the box tight a sudden panic
of haste came over him it seemed to
him that orthis had given them this
trust with his own hands if they failed
now for lack of time   

  he shouted at the others thrust them
on harried them into the skiff they
took off from the ledge they did not
want to be near the hip of orthis when
they did what they were going to do
quorn sent the light craft racing across
the dead world searching for a place to
land

 keep your pressure suits on and
your helmets ready he said

  edri bent over the notebook from the
metal box tremblingly reading

  its all here-the equations the for-
mulae the instructions he said hoarse-
ly i dont understand them but others
will

 he looked at trehearne with red-
rimmed eyes orthis has a foreword
here and he was the first of the star-
born the mutation began spontaneous-
ly on that first long voyage the con-
stant vibration of speed-not speed as
we know it now but more than the hu-
man body was used to speed approach-
ing the velocity of light-and the im-
pact of interstellar radiation on the liv-
ing cell thats what did it orthis was
the end-product of four generations of

breeding under those conditions

  he was natures first attempt to cre-
ate galactic man to readjust the human
body to meet new needs and the thing
he labored on so long was the reduction
of that long natural process to a work-
able formula that could accomplish the
change in one generation instead of four
he found it of course and its all here
quorn broke in this place looks as
good as any at least itll give us a little
more cover

  he was taking the skiff down care-
fully toward the flat bed of an ancient
watercourse the channel was filled now
with frozen air but in bygone ages it
had gouged a deep canyon in the rock
leaving eroded holes and overhangs
quorn worked the skiff into one of these
under the canyon wall

  edri was going over his book again
making sure dazed with the hypnosis of
exhaustion and the need to be right he
did not dare to fumble or read a figure
wrong trehearne realized the weight
of responsibility

  trehearne himself went aft with
quorn and began to struggle with the
ultra-wave equipment he was possessed
by a demon of urgency and he had not
the slightest idea what he was doing
quorn gave orders and trehearne
obeyed hooking the power leads to the
skiffs generators was the hardest task
of all

  somehow they finished it they sat
edri down in front of the transmitter
with his book quorn adjusted switches
the generators hummed feeding power
into the big transmitter edri blinked
moistening dry lips

  quorn said ive got it on the emer-
gency band covering all channels every
ultra-wave receiver within its range
will pick it up-including non-vardda
communications centers also the min-
ute kerrel picks it up hell be able to
center us and come in on our beam so
make it fast

  edri nodded glancing nervously at
trehearne quorn made the last dial set-
ting and then spoke harshly into the
transmitter

  g-one g-one emergency request
	startling stories

clearance all channels use your record-
ers g-one clear all channels  

  edri drew an unsteady breath and
leaned forward and spoke rapidly i
may not have time to repeat we have
found the ship of orthis we have found
the ship of orthis here follow the for-
mulae for the vardda mutation

it was as short as that he began to
i-ead from the notebook going fast
but taking pains to make each syllable
clear beyond doubt

  quorn hung tensely over his dials
trehearne sat motionless his muscles
quivered sweat ran into his eyes edris
voice went on

  suddenly quorns hoarse voice cried
hurry kerrels cruiser has already
picked it up and theyre trying to jam
us theyll be close enough in minutes
to blank us out

  edris face became that of a hunted
thing his voice rose shrill racing des-
perately to the last page he started
then to repeat

  too late-were blanked out quorn
yelled that means kerrel is close
enough to-

  the skiff was suddenly shaken as
though by a giant hand then it shud-
dered again harder quorn leaped up
shell-bursts kerrels ranging us down
the canyon

  trehearne tried to thrust edris hel-
met over his head edri fought him
off clinging to the transmitter quorn
helped pull him around

  youre jammed anyway he yelled
youre not getting through come on
between them they got edris helmet
on the skiff was racked again and
something broke with a crackle of ex-
ploding glass

  trehearne locked his own helmet
through the audio he could hear quorn
shouting something about the airlock
and getting clear half dragging edri
trehearne began to run staggering
against the bulkheads

  they reached the airlock and got it
open out on the canyon floor light blos-
somed and died great chunks of rock
struck silently against the skiff the

deck leaped up under their feet tre-
hearne saw quorn fall outward then
he too was pitched out of the lock carry-
ing edri with him

  he hit the ground hard he thought
his helmet was broken and then there
was nothing but darkness

  when he came to the cruiser had land-
ed close by and men in spacesuits were
coming toward the skiff carrying weap-
ons in their hands

  trehearne got to his feet the moving
beams of the belt lamps showed him
faces inside the glassite helmets one of
them belonged to kerrel it came toward
him and looked at edri motionless on
the ground and at quorn crawling on
hands and knees

  it said i ought to kill you all
trehearne became aware of a smaller
figure in a spacesuit a figure that
carried no weapon and had the face of
shairn inside the glassite he heard
her voice crying through the audio
michael are you all right and then
bitterly oh michael you fool
kerrel turned he said furiously i
told you to stay in the cruiser

  she answered im not under your
orders kerrel-not yet

  men entered the skiff to search it
other men picked up quorn and edri
and carried them away kerrel looked
at trehearne and gestured with his long
weapon that was like a gun

  walk ahead of me trehearne
trehearne began to walk ahead of
kerrel and shairn it was dark in the
canyon whose walls cut off the galactic
light he could hardly see the cruiser he
was going toward but the beam of ker-
rels belt-lamp was squarely upon him
the skin of his back crawled

  youll get this one cheap kerrel
said trehearne you wont even have
to promise the price of a ship

 do your talking when you get
aboard said kerrel go on

  what about the mirzim 

  we overhauled her kerrel an-
swered your friends are all safely un-
der hatches keep going trehearne
dont try any tricks

  the surface was rough underf
the starmen of llyrdis	

trehearne was still groggy and the light
beam swung making a shifting pattern
of whiteness and black shadow he
stumbled and went to his hands and
knees

 ah said kerrels voice with infi-
nite satisfaction a clear attempt to
escape

shairns voice gasped out no
kerrel

 trehearne swung around clawing at
the frozen surface shairn was clinging
to kerrels arm he struck her twice
with his free arm then raging he
raised his knee and drove it to knock
her back

 trehearne slammed solidly against
kerrels turning body he got both
hands on the long weapon kerrel was
cursing shairn in a low hard undertone

 trehearne wrenched the weapon away
from kerrel he raised it like a club and
brought it down on the gleaming crown
of the helmet he brought it down hard
a lot went into that blow a lot of mem-
ories

 the glassite cracked

 kerrel had time to scream just once

 trehearne dropped the weapon men
came running toward him shairn had
risen to her feet again she came and
stood against him so that the men would
not fire trehearne looked down at the
ghastly face inside the riven helmet he
shivered and turned away

 shairn was saying over and over
kerrel tried to murder him there was
no escape attempt ill swear to it

 the men pulled her away and gath-
ered around trehearne one of them
said this isnt going to help you much
killing an agent of the council he
turned on shairn he was a tired man
all right he shouted were not go-
ing to do anything you can tell your
story when you get to llyrdis he gave
trehearne a shove get on there

 trehearne plodded on to the cruiser
he was put into a locked room with edri
and quorn and joris and two other men
from the mirzim edri was still dazed
joris looked at them he was an old
man centuries old but hope lived in

him still

  did you do it he cried did you
find the ship

  trehearne said we found it he
turned to quorn he reached out and
caught him by the wrists and asked
did we do it did we get the message
through 

  quorns mouth trembled i think
theres a chance we did kerrels jam-
ming came in on us so fast but i
think   

  he suddenly wrenched his hands
away his face agonized how do i
know if we got through oh god how
do i know

chapter xvii
galactic man

the voyage was ending they had
known from the long period of de-
celeration that it was ending and now
the last pressures and the small grind-
ing shocks as the cruiser settled into its
dock told them that they were again
on llyrdis

  the bells rang and the throb of the
generators gave way to an unfamiliar
silence they waited then and nothing
happened the hours went by and noth-
ing happened

  trehearne said finally theyre not
even going to remove us from the cruis-
er theyll take us off to wherever were
bound for without even hearing us
edri shook his head no vardda law
sentences no man without formal trial
they could see nothing hear nothing
until at last the door of the room was
unlocked there were officers and guards
-many guards all of them armed their
faces told nothing

  you will come with us said the
young captain of guards soberly

  where demanded joris to uyr-
dis prison or-

  all communication with the prison-
ers forbidden clipped the young cap-
tain you will come with ua
	startling stories

  it seemed strange to trehearne to
walk again on unmoving floors corri-
dors decks-on a planet

  the tawny glare of aldebaran was
dazzling when they filed out of the cruis-
er the air seemed unnaturally damp
heavy with the salt tang of the sea

  he and joris and edri the first to
emerge looked around with a throb of
eagerness of half-hope they could not
see much the cruiser had landed in a
closed-off sector and there were other
guards waiting out here beside a num-
ber of ultra-cars

  but trehearne could hear he could
hear all the usual hum and din and
clangor of the vast spaceport the grind
of cranes and rumble of trams the
scream of a fast planet-flyer coming in
and then the whoosh of a great bulk
hurtling upward a star-ship outbound
for distant suns and in the distance the
shining towers of llyrdis city still mag-
nificently challenged the heavens

  trehearne felt a sick sense of futility
all this vast ordered turmoil of routine
and activity all the galaxy-wide trade
that centered here the thousand-year
solidity of vardda commercial monopoly
-how could he have dreamed that a
pitifully faint and aborted radio call
could ever shake it the faces of his
friends showed him how their last hope
had begun to wane

  the cars said the young captain
you four go in the first one

  edri found his voice what about
arrin

  i am permitted to tell you that your
comrade has been removed to the hospi-
tal and is in good condition

  joris said nothing trehearne saw his
sunken eyes looking across the spaceport
and thought how it must be for him to
come back so to this place where for
years he had sat with his hands guiding
the vardda ships that came and went

  the car took them out of the space-
port fast trehearne saw that other
cars with guards alone in them ran
unobtrusively along ahead of and behind
them

  and nothing was changed in llyrdis
the peacock city preened itself beneath

the sun iridescent splendid its streets
thronged with the smiling vardda and
the other stranger races-echoing with
music brilliant with color

  they passed a vardda man and girl
who stood laughing as they talked it
was then that trehearne ceased alto-
gether to hope

  were going to the council hall
edri said presently

  joris nodded somberly i could have
told you that as a council member i
have to be formally impeached and re-
moved before charges against me can
be pressed

  he added grimly old ristin the
chairman wont weep over that we
tangled pretty often in tho past

  the council hall sat amid a crowded
nexus of governmental buildings it
dominated llyrdis not by size but by
age it was a gray old pile without
beauty but with the massiveness and
solidity of eternal things

  its courts and corridors and staring
officials trehearne saw only vaguely
they slid over his vision and nothing
seemed entirely tangible until in an
anteroom shairns face leaped real to
his eyes

  she had been waiting to see him pass
he knew her face was white and
strained and she said nothing but her
eyes said michael michael

  he looked back at her as they went
on and he wondered what she read in
his own eyes and then they had entered
the deliberative chamber itself

it was not large and not crowded-a
half-moon-shaped hall with some-
thing more than a hundred vardda in
its chairs of the blur of faces turned
toward him most were grave some
curious some open in their hatred

  ristin the chairman was a magnifi-
cent white-haired old lucifer who dis-
dained the petty vanity of pretending
that this was a routine matter

  this council is not a judicial body
he said this criminal charge against
y o u-piracy resisting of authority
murder-will be handled by the regular
courts we are here investigating a mat-
the starmen of llyrdis	j

ter urgent to the state

 as for murder- trehearne began
savagely but the chairman interrupted

  i said the criminal charges will be
examined later the lady shairn has
already made her deposition i under-
stand but what concerns us here is the
much graver offense against the vardda
community

 joris got up thrusting his gray
head forward like an old mastiffs he
growled since this is an investigation
you cant legally carry it out without
hearing us

  ristin said grimly the coordinator
of the port was always good at making
himself heard but you will have to wait
this time joris he looked up at the
watching vardda faces as he added
the problem of your personal offense
is not foremost what concerns us most
urgently is the general policy to be
adopted by the council

  trehearne hardly heard that glimpse
of shairn had done things to him and
his mind was far away he wondered
vaguely why edri who had sat sagging
heavily beside him suddenly stiffened
why edri convulsively grasped his wrist

  ristin was continuing therefore i
emphasize again that we of the council
must not let any emotion of resentment
sway our judgment we are elected to
serve the best interests of the vardda
as a whole and we must let no other con-
siderations affect our decision

  then joris laughed his head came
up and his bellowing laughter echoed
and re-echoed from the vaulted roof he
swung around to trehearne and edri
and quorn and his eyes were blazing
now by god you did it after all

  trehearne still only half understand-
ing felt a white-hot thrill edri had be-
gun to tremble violently

  ristins cool voice cut in believe me
your exultation is premature neverthe-
less there is no purpose in concealing
the fact that your actions have present-
ed us with an unprecedentedly grave
problem

  quorn said hoarsely to trehearne
dont you get it our message went
through

  trehearne understood then the grav-
ity of the watching faces the bitter
hatred in some of them the strong lead-
ership the old chairman was wielding to
conquer the crisis-all these belied the
everyday appearance of llyrdis that had
been the death-knell of his hopes

 through them after a thousand
years the voice of orthis had spoken
to the galaxy and it had been heard-
somewhere it had been heard

  ristin was saying so far only vague
rumor and hearsay is abroad every
operator who might have heard the
broadcast has been warned not to repeat
it but there are bound to be orthists
among them the fact that non-vardda
worlds possess ultra-wave receivers for
use in their commerce with us is an
even more serious matter

  it stands thus-that in spite of the
news-services cooperation with us on
the matter it is slowly becoming public
knowledge that orthis secret was found
and broadcast at least three recordings
of it have been found and two written
copies we can assume that there are
more

  joris said grimly in other words-
the secret is out and everyone will soon
know that-and what are you going to
do about it

  the coordinator- of the port has
summed it up ristin agreed coolly
what shall we do about it

  a tall vardda leaped up and cried i
suggest that the first thing we do is to
execute these traitors i

  there was a fierce chorus of agree-
ment from a few dozen voices ristin
rapped sharply for order

  i have reminded you that our para-
mount consideration is the ultimate best
interests of our people let us have no
more such outbreaks

  an older vardda man rose in the tiers
and said quietly before i advance my
suggestion i should admit that i have
always had secret orthist sympathies
i dont think that i am the only one here
you must allow for that

  he went on i would have liked long
ago to see this unnatural monopoly end-
ed now our hand has been forced i
	startling stories

suggest that our best and wisest course
is to act at once-to declare publicly
that we vardda are going to give the
secret to the whole galaxy

  the secret is out anyway but by
acting quickly we can take credit for it
we can aver that the broadcast was
made with our consent remember in
a few generations other worlds will be
flying the stars-and we do not want
them cherishing a legacy of hatred for
us then

  trehearne listening smiled grimly
politics dont change much across the
galaxy

  but its all we hoped fori edri
whispered it would work too

discussion angry debate had
sprung up it went on and on
passionate voices accusing and denying
ristin sternly maintaining order bring-
ing back the argument to the main issue
time after time finally in a lull of the
disputing voices joris swung around
and faced the council

  now listen to me the old man
roared youd think the way some of
you talk that this meant the end of the
vardda the end of llyrdis the end of
everything thats utter asininity

  in the first place mutations dont
take place overnight it will be a genera-
tion or two before the other races start
going out between the stars in any num-
bers

  trehearne saw that sink home the
vardda council being human could not
worry too deeply for long about a future
they wouldnt see

  and furthermore joris bellowed
when every half-baked folk in the gal-
axy does take to starflight does that
mean the great vardda trade is ruined
forever listen we vardda were the
first to go out to the stars the first do
you think all the lubberly races of the
galaxy can compete with us out there
do you think so 

  he caught them with that with the
vardda pride the vardda glory tre-
hearne saw the strained faces changing
not all of them but many

  joris paused before he said his final

word do you think there will ever be
a time when we vardda cant hold our
own 

  there was not much talk after that
there were questions protests doubts
but little more argument all the argu-
ments had been spoken

 we have to decide this now or
never ristin told them if we delay
longer there will not be a choice
trehearne heard the resolution read
and the voting and the result not easily
could the vardda yield forty-three vot-
ed against the resolution but seventy-
nine for it

  ristin said it will be announced by
general broadcast tonight that in view
of the advance of civilization on many
star-worlds the vardda deem the time
ripe to share the secret of mutation with
other selected races

  quorn said its done trehearne its
done

  trehearne still could not quite grasp
that that simple statement marked a
change forever in the galaxy that with
it all human races began the great
change toward galactic man

  and these criminals who forced us
to do the thing demanded a vardda
recalcitrant glaring at trehearne and
his fellows

  we have no choice there ristin
said dryly to punish them for what
they did would belie our own announce-
ment the ordinary charges against
them can be dismissed the murder
charge has already been refuted by the
lady shairn

  so that for their crime they go un-
punished 

  ristin sighed regretfully the inter-
ests of the state demand it yes
trehearnes comrades were breaking
down half stunned half incredulous of
the victory they had thought beyond
them but strangely trehearne was not
thinking of what they had won for the
galaxy races he was feeling a pride
that joris phrase we vardda had
kindled in him

 we vardda-

  and he was one of them he was one
of the star-lords the first the oldest
the starmen of llyrdis

the greatest of the starmen

  edri was thinking of something else
he had stepped forward amid the gen-
eral clamor to speak to ristin there
is one more thing orthis-

  a cruiser has been sent to guard
his ship said ristin

  edri nodded painfully but orthis
was not ever child of a planet he was
star-born dwelling always between the
stars he has sat long on that far world
if his ship could take space again   
ristin said musingly a good
thought by putting that ship into an
orbit around our system well create a
monument that will remind all the
galaxy that it was a vardda who gave
them star-flight

  edri turned to trehearne and joris
he said ortis is coming home

  it was then that he began to cry

the message left for trehearne had
told him simply that shairn would
be at the silver tower it was handed
him when they finally emerged from the
council chamber joris got him a car
and driver trehearne hesitated sud-
denly hating to part from the old man
edri and quorn and the others had
their eager plans but joris took no joy
in their victory

  had it been done a generation ago
my son would be a star-captain now
he muttered in answer to trehearnes
awkward words well-

  the car took him out of llyrdis
smooth and fast and the great flare of
aldebaran sank toward the sea and
dusk came on he saw the silver tower
glimmering in the twilight and the dark
figure down on the shadowy beach and
he went toward shairn

  he put out his arms toward her but
she held him off she spoke to him
steadily her face a white blur in the



dusk let us have no hidden things
between us michael i want you to
know i hate you for what you have done
to the vardda i will always hate you
for that

  he was astounded all the firm hopes
he had built up dissolving beneath him
shairn went on but i love you michael
-for everything else

  he had her in his arms then all
doubts gone he said presently youll
get over that resentment shairn
no michael it will always be there
i warn you of that now

  life with shairn would be no haven
of peace but he was not afraid he
knew that he was not the man for too
much peace

  they walked slowly back together
toward the silver tower the stars
were burgeoning and trehearne looked
up at them he looked at the far faint
spark of little sol and thought of earth
and of a changeling born there who had
by miracle won his way home

  that green and distant earth knew
nothing yet of the battle fought and
won beyond the edges of the galaxy
but it had been earths battle too and
she would know in time even to earth
when a generation had passed the star-
ships would begin to go openly and
with their internecine conflicts past her
young men too would go out among the
stars to join the great march of galactic
man

  and who could say where that march
might not lead them to other galaxies
other island continents of suns   

  trehearnes thoughts became lost in
the immensities of the future he shook
his head and smiled and brought shairn
closer to him in the circle of his arm
they climbed the last of the steep path
in the gathering dark and the silver
tower took them in

       a captain future novelet
       by edmond hamilton

                     chapter i
                     the awakening

still and cold in its lightless vault
of bone the brain stirred feebly
slowly slowly it began to toake and
remember-timeless memories flowing
across it in a dark inchoate tide from
nowhere into nothingness

  he was alone in apace quite alone
floating turning drifting he had no
destination and he waa in no hurry he

 had lost the sun and the planets there
 were not even any stars

   he did not worry the dead do not
 insist on stars he had forgotten how he
 came to die and he was glad

   after a long while far distant in the

when the futuremen
revived john carey from
his deep freeze he wanted to
go home-but where in space was home

                                        
infinite night he saw a tiny gleam he
regarded it without curiosity or fear
and then he realized that some inexor-
able current had caught him and was
sweeping him toward the light hurling
him at it in a swift relentless rush he
knew that he did not want to go to it-
but there was no escape

  the little point of light leaped and
spread into a sun a nova a shattering
glare terror overcame him he clawed
at the comforting darkness as it fled
past but he could not hold onto it and it
seemed to him that he could hear the

small thin shrieking of his body against
the void as it was sucked into the de-
vouring brilliance

  there was a face between him and
the light huge and awesome he cried
out but no sound came and then it was
gone the light the face even himself
swallowed up in the quiet night

  memories-the aloneness the remem-
bering the timeless drift a sound like
the rustle of far-off surf that booijied
louder and louder and became a voice
speaking out of the heavens saying
wake up john carey wake up


	startling stories

  and he thought he answered but i
am dead

  how had he come to die

memories groping uncertain
coming faster clearer clothed in
vivid color a girls face a girls red
mouth saying dont go dont go if you
love me youll never come back

  men and a ship-a little ship a frail
and tiny craft it seemed for the long
way it was going and the high dreams
it had hard-faced iron-handed men
braver than angels and more hungry
than they were brave hungry for new
worlds and the unknown things that lay
beyond the mountains of the moon be-
yond the still canals of mars beyond
the glittering deadly belt

  he remembered now the men and the
ship how they had gambled their lives
against glory and lost we shot the
asteroids he muttered in the silence
of his mind jupiter was there ahead
of us a big golden apple almost in our
hands i remember how the moons
looked swarming like bees around it i
remember   

  the meteor-the tearing agony of
metal the last glimpse of horror in the
ship before the air-burst took him with
it into space through the riven pilot-
dome the brief bitter knowledge that
this was death

  dead he said again im dead
the strange voice answered if you
want to you can live again

  he thought about that he thought
about it for a long time in the darkness
to live again-the light and the warmth
the hunger and pain and hope the want-
ing the being able to want he thought
and he was not sure and then at last he
whispered how tell me hoio

  open your eyes and come back back
where the light is you were here before
dont you remember open your eyes
john carey

  he did or thought he did and there
was nothing but mist heavy darkling
clouds of it far far away he saw the
gleam of light beyond him and he tried
to grope toward it but the mists were
very thick

i cant he moaned im lost

  lost forever in darkness and cold
come back cried the voice strong-
ly come back and live

  he heard the sound of a hand strik-
ing smartly against flesh after a while
he felt it that little sharp pain some-
how managed to bridge a colossal gulf
and make him aware that he had a body

  his brain oriented itself with a dizzy-
ing lunge the mists tore away he
woke

  it was a full awakening the explod-
ing nova resolved itself into a light-tube
glowing against a low ceiling of metal
the countenance that had loomed so
hugely above him became the face of a
man a lean face deeply bronzed with
the unmistakable burn of space topped
with red hair and set with two level
grey eyes that looked straight into
careys and made him feel somehow
safe and unafraid

  lie still said the red-haired man
get your breath theres no hurry he
turned aside and his hands very strong
but delicate of touch busied themselves
with a vial and a gleaming needle

  carey lay still for the moment he
had not the strength to do anything else
the room was small it was fitted as a
laboratory incredibly compact and
many of the objects that his wandering
gaze passed over were strange to him

  one of these objects was a small cubi-
cal case of semi-translucent metal rest-
ing on a table the surface nearest
carey was fitted with twin lenses and
a disc so that it bore an unsettling
resemblance to a face carey thought
vaguely that it must be some sort of a
communicator

  suddenly he said im in a ship
the red-haired man smiled how can
you tell were in free fall

  i can tell carey tried to struggle
up but there are no ships beyond the
belt how   then he began to trem-
ble violently listen he said to the
stranger listen i was killed trying
to reach jupiter a meteor hit us and i
was blown clear out into space with no
armor im dead im a dead man i   
steady on said the red-haired man
earthmen

easy he set the needle into a place
already swabbed on careys naked arm
carey flinched he sobbed a little and
then the trembling quieted

  i was dead he whispered again
no said the red-haired stranger
not really dead what we call the
space-death isnt true death but cold
shock-an instantaneous stoppage of all
life processes theres no time for de-
terioration or cellular damage no pos-

no more	

  it was only then that it penetrated
careys stunned mind the phrase that
had been used so casually a moment be-
fore

  you said in my time he repeated
how long    he stopped his mouth
was dry he tried again forcing out the
words that did not wish to be spoken
how long was i asleep out there

  the man who called himself curt
newton hesitated then asked what

captain future

sibility of decay the organism stops
short it can by certain means be start-
ed going again

 he looked thoughtfully down at carey
and added many lives are restored
that way lives that would have been
considered ended in your time

 carey said numbly then you found
me floating in space in frozen sleep
you-revived me

 yes space law requires that any
ship-wreckage encountered on radar
must be investigated thats how we
found you the stranger smiled wel-
come back to life carey my name is
curt newton

year was it when you met disaster
carey

  it was nineteen ninety-one it was
june nineteen ninety-one when we left
earth

  newton reached for a calendar pad
held it up he did not speak and theie
was pity in his eyes

  carey saw the date on it and at first
it was too incredible to touch him oh
no he said not all that time all those
generations no its not true

  it is

  but it cant be   his voice trailed
off the numbers on the pad the awful
sum of years blurred and darkened be-
	startling stories

fore him once more he began to tremble
and this time it was for fear of life not
of death why did you bring me back
he whispered i have no place here im
still a dead man

abruptly from beyond the closed
bulkhead door there came the
sound of footsteps strange steps pon-
derous and clanking as though someone
enormously heavy walked in metal boots
curt newton turned his head sharply

  grag he called hold on there
wait

  the footsteps hesitated and a voice
from beyond the door said mockingly
i told you so what do you want to do
frighten the poor chap out of his wits 
the voice had a peculiar soft sibilance
of tone

  it was answered by a rumbling metal-
lic growl an utterly unhuman sound
that seemed to have words in it carey
got up he clung to the edge of the sur-
geons table fighting the weakness that
was on him his eyes fixed on the bulk-
head door

  carey said curt newton things
have changed and science has come a
long way there are three others aboard
this ship besides myself theyre not-
well not quite human as men of your
day understood the term even now in
our time theyre unique created by
techniques far beyond the general
knowledge but you must not be afraid
of them theyre my friends and will be
yours

  a chill came over carey creeping
into his bones he continued to stare at
the door what waited behind it what
monstrous things-not quite human
not quite human the words repeated
themselves in his brain scuttling across
it like spiders spinning icy webs tight-
ening until he could barely hear new-
tons voice talking on

  robot   faintly the voice came
and carey stared at the door the drops
of sweat ran slowly down his face
robot human in intelligence created
by scientific genius   

  there were sounds behind the door
i there were presences not of the flesh

careys mouth was dry with the taste of
fear

     android human in all respects
but created also in the laboratory  

  carey began to move toward the door
what dreadful facet of the future had
he been cast into what uncanny chil-
dren of this undreamed-of age were
lurking there behind that panel he
could not bear to know but somehow
not knowing was worse not knowing
and wondering and thinking   

       the brain of a great scientist
a human kept alive for many years in a
special case  

  robot android living brain a red-
haired man and a date on a calendar
a ship where there are no ships a life
where there is no living a dream
carey-a dream youre dreaming drift-
ing along with the endless tides the
dark night tides beyond the belt open
the door carey what difference in a
dream 

  a human figure lithe and graceful
whose face had the unhappy beauty of
a faun green-eyed and mocking and
beside it a shape a towering gigantic
manlike form built all of gleaming
metal a shape that bent toward him
reaching out its dreadful arms glaring
at him with two round flashing eyes

  a harsh toneless voice spoke close
behind carey saying catch him cur-
-tis

  carey looked for the source of the
strange voice the cubical box that he
had taken for a communicator had risen
from its shelf hovering upon tenuous
beams and he saw that the surface
with the twin lenses and the disc was
indeed a face

  no said carey dont touch me
dont any of you touch me

  he made his way back into the little
laboratory the room had closed in on
him the darkening air pressed against
him like water he was conscious that
his hands were cold that his feet were
very heavy treading on a surface he
could no longer feel

  i tried to soften the shock for him
curt newton was saying somewhere
across the universe
earthmen

  and the harsh voice of the cubical
metal case replied without inflection
poor fellow he has many shocks in
store

  carey sat down he put his face be-
tween his cold palms and the knowledge
came to him the truth that he had not
quite believed before but from which
now there was no escape

  he had bridged the gulf of time he
had left his own past in the dust of cen-
turies behind him and he stood face to
face with a future that was beyond his
knowing he was brother to lazarus
come forth into an alien world

chapter ii
return from space

he could hear them talking he did
not want to hear them he did
not want to lift his head and see them
again he did not even want to be alive
but he could not help hearing

  grags booming voice the thunderous
voice of the robot i didnt know when
i fished him out of that wreckage that
he had been floating there so long
the harsh inflexible voice of the metal
box of the brain who had once been
simon wright a scientist of earth a
long time indeed said simon wright
and added slowly he is old this man
-almost as old as space-flight

  the soft sibilance of the android at
once cruel and compassionate it was
no kindness to bring this one back curt
hes as much alone in the world as we
are

 there was something in the attitude
of these three unhuman strangers that
struck carey suddenly it was a strange
thing for one who had for all his life
been merely a man named john carey
of no particular importance to anyone
but himself it was awe and that real-
ization brought another with it-thac
john carey was a creature as queer and
unreal to these beings of the future as
they were to him

no more	

grag

  curt newton said to the android i
think youre wrong otho i think any
man with guts enough to buck the belt
in those old tin skyrockets would rather
live even in an unknown time than
sleep eternity away

  carey did not answer that he did not
know the answer

  he creates a problem for us curtis
said simon wright and at a time
when we have a grave problem of our
own you understand that

  yes curt newton went and stood
in front of carey and spoke his name
carey looked up

  i want you to know one thing said
newton youre not alone not without
friends youll stay with us until youre
oriented after that-well we have a
certain amount of influence and well see
that you get a start on whatever sort
of life you may choose

  still carey did not answer

  listen said newton you were a
pioneer why you were or what you
wanted out of it i dont know but what-
ever it was you were trying to push the
frontiers back so you could get it well
you succeeded you and others like you
even in failure you succeeded

  there are colonies on the farthest
	startling stories

moons men have even begun to reach
out to the worlds of other stars you
helped to make all that possible carey
and youre alive to see it isnt that
enough to make you want to live arent
you curious to see the civilization you
helped to build

  carey smiled faintly psychother-
apy he said we had it in my day
and it wasnt any more subtle all right
newton ill be curious as hell when i
have time to think about it meanwhile
im alive-so i dont really have any
choice do i 

  he got up deliberately he forced him-
self to look at grag and otho and
simon wright

  all right he said to them all to
no one ill get used to it in time a
man can get used to anything if he has
time

  quite said the voice of simon
wright all of us have learned the
truth of that-even curtis

  carey tried in the period that fol-
lowed but it was a hard thing to do
to his own time-sense the great gap
between yesterday and today was only
an instant of sleep he caught himself
often thinking of earth as he knew it
of the men and women who would be
there just as he had left them of the
songs and the streets and the faces of
buildings the uncountable small details
that make up the sum of an epoch

  it was hard to teach himself that they
were there no more but one or another
of his shipmates was always near him
and never let things get too bad so
gradually from constant association
grag and otho and simon wright be-
came familiar to carey and he no longer
felt that uncanny twinge when he was
near them

  simon remained enigmatic and re-
mote an intelligence keen and brilliant
far beyond careys power to understand
wrapped in his own thoughts his own
researches knowledge was simons
thirst and his existence and it seemed
to carey that although simon wright
had been a man of earth before his
brain was taken from his dying body
and preserved by the magic of a future

science simon had become the least
human of them all

  grag and otho were easier the an-
droid was so nearly human that only
now and again did a flicker of something
other-worldly in his green eyes remind
carey that otho was not as other men
even then it was impossible to feel any
horror of him carey had known a lot
of mothers sons but seldom one that
he liked as much as the sharp-tongued
ironic otho whose most pointed barbs
were tempered with pity

  as for grag once carey had got used
to his seven-foot clanking bulk and enor-
mous strength he became fond of the
great robot whose only faults were
over-enthusiasm and a certain lack of
judgment it was however constantly
upsetting to carey to realize that this
lumbering metal giant had quite as much
intelligence as he and a good deal more
knowledge

  the man curt newton the man many
called captain future remained para-
doxically the most difficult to under-
stand of all the four it was only bit by
bit from the others that carey picked
up newtons story-his strange birth
and stranger upbringing in a lonely lab-
oratory hidden under the surface of the
moon an orphan with no other com-
panions than the three who were called
the futuremen

no wonder carey thought that with
such a background newton was
withdrawn and guarded in his approach
to the ordinary relationships of men
he like his companions-and like carey
too in this new incarnation of his-was
set apart forever from the normal
world carey sensed that the easy casual
manner of the red-haired man had been
painfully acquired that beneath it lay
a dark and solitary creature much bet-
ter not aroused

  carey soon discovered something else
about curt newton he was angry and
it was no mere passing rage it was a
cold black fury that rode him all across
the spatial gulf that plunged between
saturn whence he had come and earth
where he was going and the cause of it
earthmen

was a message he had received from a
man named ezra gurney about another
man named lowther

  there was something about a monop-
oly on a certain kind of fuel which was
going to put lowther in control of all
shipping to and from the distant star-
colonies which were not much at pres-
ent but would grow it seemed that the
star-ships took on their high-potential
fuel for the long jump at pluto where
the radioactive ore was mined and re-
fined

  and now by devious manipulations
of hidden stock lowther had got con-
trol of the refining companies and raised
the price out of reach there were ships
stranded at pluto and men in an ugly
mood and newton was heading fast for
earth to see what he could do about it

  it sounded a dirty enough deal and
carey hoped that newton would bring
lowther to time but this talk of star-
colonies and star-ships was beyond him
his mind was still thinking of jupiter
as the unattained and well-nigh unat-
tainable any problems of star-ships or
the men who flew them were distant and
unreal furthermore he was too deeply
immured in his own fears and loneli-
ness in the strangeness of being alive

  he began to think more and more of
earth he was hungry to see it to feel
it under his feet again to look up into
a blue sky at the familiar sun he had
been long away from earth when he fell
asleep-an eternity it had seemed shut
up in an iron coffin outbound for jupiter

 he remembered now how they had
talked about earth crouching within
the narrow walls that hid them from
the black negation of space the voices
still rang in his ears the faces were as
clear as though he had only turned his
head away for a moment or two

  craddock and szandor miles and del-
aporte gaines coletti fenner-the red-
headed the black and the fair-the dif-
ferent particular tricks of phrase and
expression the kindness and cruelty and
courage and fear-the wisdom and the
folly moulded together into the sepa-
rate forms of men and they had talked
of earth

no more	

  they had planned what they would do
when they got back with the wealth of
a new world in their hands they had
talked of the women who would be wait-
ing for them of the parades and the
speeches the fame that would be theirs
around the globe they had talked and
all the time the darkness that was just
beyond the hull had been listening with
a silent mirth and john carey was the
only one who would ever come back
again

  as the ship rushed nearer to the orbit
of earth careys eagerness increased
until it was like a fever in him he talked
of home as those other men had talked
and curt newton listened with a kind
of pity in his eyes

  dont expect too much he said its
changed-but its still earth not para-
dise

  the forward jets were cut in and the
ship quivered to the brake-blasts-not
the anguished uncertain shuddering of
the ships carey had known but a con-
trolled lessening of speed the green
remembered world came gleaming
across the forward port and carey
stared at it sitting motionless and ab-
sorbed urging the misty continents into
shape watching the oceans spread into
blueness and the mountains rise and be-
come real

  suddenly he was afraid he covered
his face with his hands and said i
cant i cant walk like a ghost through
streets i never aw looking for people
who have been dead for generations

  it wont be easy said curt newton
but youll have to until you do youll
be living and thinking in the past he
looked at carey half smiling after all
you came into this world a stranger once
before

  what will they say to me whis-
pered carey how do people talk to a
dead man

  as rudely as they do to everyone
else and how will they know unless you
tell them come on carey stiffen up
forget the past start thinking about
the future

  future said carey and the word
had a strange hollow sound to him
	startling stories

give me time i havent caught up with
the present yet

  he was silent after that newton
asked for and got clearance for a land-
ing the ship picked up her pattern and
spiraled in

  nothing was clear to carey confused
vistas reeled and spun beneath him a
huge monster of a city the many-colored
patchwork of a spaceport strange and
unknown yet with a haunting familiar-
ity like a language learned in childhood
and long forgotten his heart pounded
fiercely it was hard to breathe

  the ship touched ground and john
carey had come home from space

  he remained as he was sitting still
his fingers sunk deep into the padded
arms of the recoil-chair curts newtons
voice was faint and far away simon
and i are going to government center
grag will stay with the ship but otho
can go along with you if you like

  no said carey no thanks-i
there was more he wanted to say but
he could not form the words he got up
and went past the others seeing them
only as shadows the airlock was open
he went out

the blaze of a summer sun smote
hard upon him he looked up at
white clouds piling slowly in the sky
and thought out of some dim coign of
memory later there icill be a storm
he began to walk across the concrete
apron scarred with many flames 

  this was the same spaceport it had
to be for there was the city before him
and behind him was the sea here from
a little field that had looked so big and
grand the victrix had taken flight for
jupiter here a girl had said goodbye
and kissed him with the bitterness of
tears

  but it was not the same the little
field was swallowed up and gone
drowned in the mighty rows of docks
where the administration building had
stood a white pylon towered up into the
clouds the air was filled with the thun-
derous roar of ships landing taking off
jets flaming lean hulls flashing in the
sun

  great cranes clanked and rumbled
strings of lorries snorted back and
forth between the freight docks and the
warehouses and from beyond them
spoke the anvil voices of the foundries
atomic welders blazed like little suns
and the huge red tenders rolled ponder-
ously among the ships with their loads
of fuel

  carey walked slowly he was listen-
ing to the music the titan song of the
ships and the men who served them
good music to one who had first helped
to write it long ago he listened and
was proud-not just for himself but for
gaines and coletti fenner and miles
and szandor the men of his crew and
all the other crews who had christened
this port in their blood and flame

  and suddenly the song was drowned
in the chattering voices of women peo-
ple surged around him caught him up
and carried him on toward a great sleek
craft of silvery metal with a name and
an unknown flag on her bow-empress
of mars trim young men in natty uni-
forms stood by her gangplank high
heels clicked against the curving metal
with a sound as brittle as the voices

  such a wretched cruise the last time
i was simply bored to tears   

  well mars isnt what it used to be
so overrun with tourists i went last to
ganymede for a change and you have
no idea  

  a young girl giggling-its my first
trip and im just thrilled to death janet
said they have a simply heavenly or-
chestra on this ship

  under the shrill incessant chatter lay
the heavier intermittent voices of men
rich men stuffed with the tallow of
good living men with big sweating
bellies sheathed in silk comparing the
food and service on the empress with
the morning star that flew the luxury
run to venus and the royal jove and
here and there among them an anxious
younger man with a red-mouthed wom-
an on his arm underlings stripped to
their last nickel for the privilege of
rubbing shoulders with the elite on a
trip across space

  a sickness came over carey he felt
earthmen

smothered in perfume and smug sophis-
tication he looked at the trim young
officers and hated them

  over the chatter and the cries an
annunciator spoke with firm politeness
last warning for empress of mars
passengers the gangways close in six
minutes last warning  

  carey stood a silent unnoticed figure
in the crowd thinking of other ships
and other men who had left earth long
ago and the sickness in him deepened
caught in the press of soft comfortable
flesh he heard gongs clanging and a
surge of voices and then the sibilant roar
that became a purring thunder as a
glistening fabric of shining metal lifted
skyward then he was swept away in
the backwash of people from the empty
dock

 she really earned a nice vaca-
tion  

      and those cruise-ships are so
much more fun than ordinary space-
trips they have hostesses and games
and always something to do

  carey stumbled out of the stream at
last into a little deserted backwater
around a tall pillar that stood at the
edge of the spaceport

  there was gold lettering on it only
a little dingy from the back-blast of
many ships carey saw a name he knew

  he looked closer it was a tall pillar
and he had to look high to see the legend
that read to the pioneers of
space

  now he saw underneath that legend
were names and dates first the names
of the great trail-blazers

 gorham johnson-mark carew-jan
wenzi-

 wenzi    once a small boy had
watched with worshipping eyes as a
grizzled one-armed man stumped toward
a ridiculous rocket-ship

  a little farther down not much lane
fenner-etienne delaporte-william
gaines-yes all the victrix crew includ-
ing john carey all with the golden stars
beside them that meant lost in space

  names-names and men his friends
his shipmates his rivals jim hardee
the kid who had sat drinking with him

no more	

the night before he hit for jupiter
while he had lain dead in space young
hardee had gone on doing the big
things he dreamed of and now like the
others he was only a dingy gold-letter
name on a forgotten monument

  the voice of the annunciator pleaded
monotonously will pallas passengers
please report at once to dock forty-
four will pallas passengers   

  old wenzi and jim hardee and young
szandor and red miles-yes and he
himself bucking the black emptiness
and the cold death to push the frontiers
out   

  attention please said the mechan-
ical voice the liner star of veyius will
land at dock fourteen at exactly six-
ten those wishing to greet incoming
passengers   

  carey sat down on the steps of the
monument otho found him there star-
ing at the bright crowds going back and
forth listening to the voices and the
laughter the swift proud thunder of
the ships

  otho touched his shoulder and after
a while carey asked him tonelessly did
we die for this

         chapter iii
         men of earth

for the better part of two days curt
newton was busy carrying his fight
against lowther into one government
office after another and during that
time with otho determinedly sticking
to him to keep him out of trouble carey
wandered about in the city

  it was very large it had always been
so-the largest city on the world of
earth now it was no longer merely
large but monstrous bloated towering
spreading gorged with humanity and
wealth yet it seemed less crowded than
carey remembered

  the buildings were taller now fright-
eningly tall and there were covered
walks of chrome and glassite spanning
	startling stories

the dizzy canyons in between so that a
man might go across the city and never
touch the ground traffic ran on many
levels underneath the streets were
quiet and clean and carey missed the
brawling taxicabs the surge and hum
of crowds

  he watched the people who passed
him the tempo had slowed since the
days he knew men and women strolled
now where before they had almost run
their faces were a little different too
more relaxed and satisfied he did not
think that they were much happier or
wiser certainly no more kind

 men and women well fed well
dressed making money spending it
palaces of entertainment offering elab-
orate amusements to suit every taste
travel bureaus displaying their three-
dimensional living posters urging peo-
ple no longer to visit quaint brittany
or the romantic caribbean but luring
them instead with the ancient martian
cities and the pleasure-domes of trop-
ical venus

  shop windows full of marvels tenu-
ous spider-silks from venus necklaces
of martian rubies like drops of blood
to glow against white flesh jugs of curi-
ous wines from the moons of jupiter
the splendid furs of beasts that hunt
across the frozen polar seas of neptune

  we opened the way carey thought
we died and they grow fat

  stone and steel and plastic and rare
metals to make the giant towers splen-
did soft colors soft sounds of music
from garden terraces far above where
the sea wind tempered the heat and set
the fronds of other-worldly shrubs to
rustling

  terraces where people sat feeding on
delicacies brought across space in fleets
of special ships watching languidly the
musicians and the dancers who were as
alien as the exotic plants everywhere
was the pervading softness the silk-
wrapped cushioned luxury the certain
aase of men who have never had to fight

  you might as well see it all said
otho and so carey visited the places
of amusement the parks and the pleas-
ure gardens and sat upon the perfumed

terraces a dark and sombre shadow
among the butterfly crowds and often
the women turned and looked at him as
though perhaps they saw in his faoe a
thing that was lost out of the men they
knew

 every landmark was gone every
place he knew was changed there was
no single street that he remembered
and the names were gone too and the
faces gone and utterly forgotten

  suddenly carey glanced up at the
overtopping spires that leaned against
the sky and said i hate this place im
going back to the ship

  otho smiled a little wryly and they
returned to the port

  curt newton came back almost as
soon as they simon was with him and
a grizzled leathery-faced man in uni-
form who was introduced to carey as
ezra gurney

  otho studied newtons face i was
going to ask you how it went he said
but i see-it didnt go at all

  newton shook his head no he
flung himself down retreating into a
brooding silence carey saw his hard
dangerous anger

  what happened demanded grag
you dont mean to say theyre going to
let lowther get away with it

  there doesnt seem to be any way
they can stop him said ezra gurney
he had a hard honest -space-worn look
about him that carey liked he too was
angry

  the trouble is he explained that
curt has no proof against lowther
theres a half dozen refining companies
on pluto and theyve all raised their
fuel-prices together lowther only owns
one of them outright and in the open

  he says and they all say that mining
and refinery costs have gone up so that
they have to charge more for the fuel
which is legal enough all right now
we know that lowther has used dummy
corporations and juggled stock and so
on until he actually controls the other
five companies but we cant prove it

  curt went to everybody at govern-
ment center they all said the same
thing such a charge would require hear-
earthmen

ings committees investigation all that
rubbish-weeks months maybe years
because lowther is smart enough and
rich enough to stall indefinitely and the
chances of nailing him are mighty slim

 and in the meantime said curt
newton slowly the starmen are forced
either to sell out to lowther for fuel or
to stay here in the system while their
wives and families and the communities
theyve worked so hard to build go with-
out the supplies they need

  theyll give in of course because
they have to go back-and lowther will
gain a stranglehold on all the trade be-
tween the system and the colonies in
twenty years hell be rich enough to buy
and sell the sun

  grag held out his two great metal
hands and looked at them flexing the
fingers with an ominous small clanking
of the joints i vote he said that we
pay this lowther a visit

  what form of execution would you
prefer otho asked him being melted
down for scrap or converted into a nice
useful boiler theres a law against kill-
ing people even for bucket-headed ro-
bots

  who said anything about killing
boomed grag he could have an acci-
dent couldnt he

  preferably a bad one grunted ezra
but im afraid that approach wont
do

  no said curt slowly but i think
grag has the right idea at that i think
we ought to go and talk to mr low-
ther he sprang up come on carey
this will interest you as a commentary
on the brave new world you helped to
build

  i think ive seen enough of it carey
said i dont want to see any more

but he went with them only simon
wright stayed in the ship they
took a car from the spaceport except
that it had wheels and seats it bore
little resemblance to the cars carey had
known propulsion units sent it rushing
smoothly along the underground high-
ways

  by the time they came out onto the

no more	

great elevated boulevards that led across
suburb and country the long summer
dusk was falling carey turned and
looked back outlined against the deep
blue the enormous bulk of the city blazed
with many-colored light even at this
distance it had an alien look to his eyes

  the sleek suburban areas fled by be-
yond them the country still pretended
to be as it had been but careys more
primitive eyes detected the deception
artful hands had arranged the trees
and changed the courses of the brooks
and pruned the wild hedgerows into
pleasing vistas

  the car left the highway and pro-
ceeded along a private road presently
upon a slope ahead carey saw a grace-
ful structure of metal and glass shaped
by a master hand to fit like a huge syn-
thetic jewel into its setting of terraced
gardens

  the translucent walls gleamed softly
and strains of music drifted on the eve-
ning air the gardens were full of fairy
lights as they came closer carey made
out the flutter of womens skirts among
the flowers heard the sounds of laugh-
ter

  looks like a party said otho a
big one

  well give him a party rumbled
grag and cracked his metal knuckles

  they came to the gates which were
artistic but highly functional curt
newton got out he went to the small
viewer that was housed at one side and
pressed the communicator stud after
a moment carey saw him returning to
the car

  mr lowther is engaged and can see
no one he quoted and then added
particularly us he surveyed the
gates an electronic locking device
operated by remote control or with a
light-key-neither of which helps us
grag would you care to see what you
can do about it

  grags photo-electric eyes gleamed as
he heaved himself out of the car and
strode toward the gates for a minute
his enormous bulk was motionless lean-
ing forward a little with his hands on
the bars testing the resistance then he
m	startling stories

moved there was a groaning and snap-
ping and a metallic squeal and the gates
were open

  the car drove on into the grounds
there was an alarm on the gate of
course said newton theyll be wait-
ing for us and i dont want any trouble
we had better get out here and go round
through the gardens

  the air was heavy with the scent of
flowers it was warm and on the terraces
the white shoulders of women turned
back the moonbeams the music ran
slow and lilting and there was laughter
under the colored lights curt newton
walked through the gardens and after
him came grag and otho and john
carey who was moving in an unreal
dream

  one by one the dancing couples saw
them and the laughter stopped the
swirling skirts were still and the faces
watched them not with fear but with
an amazement as children might look
at sombre strangers invading their nurs-
ery the music continued soft and
sweet

  along the paths between the droop-
ing jasmine and the great pale blooms
of venus across the terraces through
a sliding wall wide open to the night
and into a pastel room with a vast ex-
panse of mirror-like floor surrounded by
graceful colonnades-and here too the
dancers drew back from the intruders

  then from one of the archways came
a group of men headed by a tall man no
older than curt newton he wore a
dress tunic of black silk and his hair
was black and his face had a clear
healthy pallor carey thought that it
was the sort of skin a woman might
have shaped smooth over handsome
bones and set with wide dark eyes only
there was nothing womanish about low-
thers face if by womanish you meant
weak or pitying or possessing any soft-
ness of heart

  the men with him were of a type
carey knew and detested they were
the kind who are always somewhere
around a man like lowther

  the two groups came to a halt and
eyed each other lowther said if you

came to say something say it and get
out

 newton put one hand on careys
shoulder and pointed with the other to
lowther there he is carey-the most
important man in the solar system oh
the system doesnt know it yet but he is
and hes modest too he owns all the
refineries on pluto but youd never know
it to look at the records

  he had raised his voice a bit so that
it could be heard clearly above the mu-
sic a considerable crowd had collected
drawn in from the gardens and there
were plenty to hear

lowther came closer to newton
he started to speak and newton
went on smoothly politely drowning
him out my friend has been away from
earth for a long time mr lowther i
wanted him to meet you so that he
could see the type of man we produce
now the successful man i thought it
might teach him a lesson while hes still
young enough to profit by it

  you see where rou made your mis-
take carey you went pioneering and
got nothing out of it but hardship and
danger and sudden death you should
have stayed at home like mr lowther
here using your wits and letting others
do the dirty work of opening up new
worlds see what youd have had-a fine
house a host of friends a good steady
business with no competition

  after awhile with patience and good
judgment youd have owned the ship-
ping-lines to which at first you only sold
fuel doesnt it make you ashamed
carey to think of how you wasted your
youth-just as the starmen stranded
out there on pluto are wasting theirs 

  lowthers face was even whiter than
before except for two streaks of dull
red along his cheekbones listen he
said if youre so worried about the
starmen youd better get word to them
to watch their step or theyll be in real
trouble

  theyre threatening to resort to vio-
lence and im leaving for pluto in the
morning to see that my property is pro-
tected i dont know exactly what youre
earthmen

trying to do newton but even you cant
buck the law-and neither can your
friends

  newtons face was tight and dark
but his voice was soft there are laws
and laws he said some of them are
so basic they havent even been written
down perhaps someday soon well have
a longer talk about laws

  he turned abruptly and went back
down the long room with the glassy
floor and the others went with him
lowther followed them at a distance
looking after them as they left the
grounds

  in the car speeding back toward the
city grag said regretfully why didnt
you let me wring his neck

  he may get it wrung yet out on
pluto answered curt when the star-
men there find out that i couldnt do
anything for them theyll try to do some-
thing for themselves he turned sud-
denly to carey there was a hard reck-
less glint in his eyes

  carey he said do you want to
come with us out to pluto and see a
fight

  carey shrugged heavily pluto an-
tares-what difference does it make
where i am yes ill go ill go any-
where that isnt earth

  he was sick with earth and opulence
and the greedy faces of men the old
horizons were gone and even pluto that
distant stepchild of the sun was the
seat of monopoly and all the ugly things
that had plagued mankind since the be-
ginning but it would be a change from
earth

  otho said to curt youre not really
going to egg them on to fight he said
it not with reproof but with hope

  curt answered grimly no theyd
only get themselves killed without ac-
complishing anything lowther was
right as of now the law is all on his
side

  he was silent and then he said no
it was another kind of fight i had in
mind

  he said nothing more until they
reached the spaceport then he grinned
it carey a grin without much humor

no more	

in it i know what you need he said
grag go on back to the ship and keep
simon company otho and i will help
carey drown his sorrows

  grag went off newton and otho took
carey some distance around the peri-
phery of the port there was an endless
number of joints along the fringe some
of them fashionable some catering to
ordinary spacehands they entered one
of the latter there were a bar and
booths and tables and carey thought
dully that this at least had not changed

  they sat down through the window
which looked out on the flash and thun-
der of the port carey could see the rows
of docks and the long sheds with the
names on them of this and that line or
company one of them said lowther
mining corporation and there
was a sleek ship in its dock with an end-
less conveyor taking cases of supplies
up its gangway

  lowthers ship getting ready to take
him off to pluto tomorrow said new-
ton harshly

  otho raised his glass toward it con-
fusion to it he said

  newton moodily watched the distant
ship carey felt the unfamiliar liquor
explode in him like liquid fire otho
signaled and presently there was an-
other glass in careys hand

  he was in no mood to refuse it he
had been a long long time in space his
awakening had been hard his home-
coming bitter the future was a cold
and formless presence crouched behind
a dark curtain

  carey drank

  there was an interval wherein he
knew that he talked but was not sure
what he said then he found himself in
cool night air and othos arm was help-
ing him into a ship

  even through his haze carey knew
simon wrights toneless voice by now
where is curtis it demanded

  hell be along otho said easily
this way carey-you need sleep

  it was later-how much later he could
not guess-when carey half-roused to
voices simons inflectionless voice and
curts
startling stories



  -and you wont tell me what youve
been up to simon was saying

  theres nothing to tell simon we
got nowhere with lowther so we came
back now weve got to go out to pluto
and see if we can stop him there

  curtis i know you and i know that
you have done something well we shall
see but one thing i am sure of and that
is that someday your anger will outrun
your wisdom and bring you to disaster

  carey drifted into sleep again he
did not even rouse to the shock of take-
off when he woke the ship was on its
way to pluto

chapter iv
earthmen no more

they made the long sweeping curve
to escape the pull of neptune and
ranged in toward the dim speck that
was pluto the jumping-off place of the
solar system with nothing beyond it
but interstellar space riding its dark
cold orbit around a sun so distant that
it seemed no greater than the other
stars

  yet even here if wealth was hidden
away man would find it carey thought
that undoubtedly a few shrewd souls
would have set up concessions for min-
ing coal in hell

  he had watched all the way out from
earth but with only a flicker of the ex-
citement he would once have known he
was interested of course because it was
his first trip beyond the orbit of jupiter
but the thrill was gone people talked of
going out to saturn or uranus now as
they had once talked of going out to
california it gave carey somehow a
feeling of having been cheated in his
day going to mars had been a big thing
and fraught with danger

  from a featureless fleck of reflected
light almost too faint to be seen pluto
grew into a recognizable world-a dark
world with black wild mountains shoot-
ing up against the stars and eerie seas

of ice there was something so cruel
and ghostlike in the look of it that carey
could not repress a shudder

  it seemed rather like an invader from
outer space than a member of the fa-
miliar system the more so since in bujk
and mass and composition it bore a
ghastly resemblance to earth as though
alien demons might have made it as a
joke

  they were a little ahead of lowther
they had not had much start on him but
they had a faster ship

  well have a little time said curt
even a few hours might be enough to
talk some sense into burke and the
others

  burke carey gathered was captain
of one of the two star-ships fighting the
battle over fuel was more or less the
leader of both crews

  they counted on help from the gov-
ernment said otho when they find
out whats happened theyre going to be
hard to hold

  weve got to hold them curt an-
swered grimly theyll blow their only
chance if they start fighting

  simon said nothing but his lens-like
eyes followed curt intently the for-
ward jets began to thunder and the
comet still curving entered its long arc
of deceleration

  as they swept closer carey saw that
the frozen plains were pocked with
craters and that some of the mountain-
peaks had been shattered by caroming
meteors the lunar desolation of the
world was hideous carey thought what
it must be like to live and work here

  the refinery men get relief at reg-
ular intervals curt told him and
there are a couple of small domed cities
around on the other side

  carey nodded even so pluto seems
a stiff place for them

  it is said curt youll see

  the televisor buzzed they had been
coming in on the automatic beam but
now somebody wanted to talk to them
curt opened the switch

  a mans face appeared on the little
screen it wore the expression of one
who has been handed a hot wire and
earthmen

doesnt know how to let go of it low-
ther mines speaking it said identify
yourself

  newton did and the mans face grew
more unhappy we cant very well stop
you from landing he said but keep
your distance from the domes-no closer
than a hundred yards theres a charged
barrier he added were well armed
the screen went dark curt shook his
head theyre all set for trouble lets
hope it hasnt already started

  curt set the comet down at last on
the edge of a vast white plain where it
struck against a mountain wall carey
saw two great dark hulls looming near
them with only their mooring lights
showing well over a hundred yards
away sunk into the living rock of the
cliffs so that only the outer bulwarks
showed was a series of steel-and-con-
crete domes

  northward along the plain in a sec-
tor marked off by beacons to warn away
incoming ships were other domes here
there were rifts and gouges in the bar-
ren rock of pluto hulks of strange ma-
chinery and structures of various sorts
whose uses carey could not be sure of

  occasional lights gleamed but noth-
ing moved the diggers and the ore-
carriers were still and no clouds of va-
por came from the buried stacks of the
refineries

  theyre shut down tight said curt
regular state of siege he looked at
the others dont forget what our
friend said about the barrier

  they put on protective coveralls-
except for grag and simon who needed
no such protection curt had handed
carey one of the suits youve come all
the way out and you might as well see
the fun he said

  then they went out into the black
plutonian night toward the star-ships
it was intensely dark colder than any-
thing carey remembered except that
one split-second touch of open space

  carey stared at the distant mockery
of a sun overcome with tho feeling that
he was indeed on the outer edge of the
universe he was so occupied by his
sensations that he was taken completely

no more	

by surprise when men rose suddenly
out of the hollows of the ice and closed
around them

  a torchbeam flashed out and struck
curt full in the face he said burke
and from beyond the light a voice grunt-
ed okay relax its him

  whats the idea curt demanded
well said burke we picked up
your call but we wanted to be sure it
really was you and not one of lowthers
smart tricks

  or said curt did you hope maybe
it was lowther himself trying to get
behind the barrier before you knew who
he was he glanced around at the
shadow-shapes of the men who were
numerous and armed

  maybe said burke he switched
the beam around the futuremen and
onto carey whos this

  hes not lowther either his name
is carey and hes a friend of mine
burke nodded briefly his attention
returned to newton whats the news
what did they say on earth

  lets go on to your ship said curt
ill tell you about it there

 burke and the others must have
known from the way he said it what
the answer was going to oe but they
turned silently and went back across
the ice with the futuremen and carey
into their ship

  they had the port shutters down but
there was light inside it felt very warm
to carey after the spatial chill they
stripped off their heavy garments and
went aft into the main cabin sorting
themselves out so that the officers of
both star-ships sat down around the
battered table and the crews crowded
where they could in the passageways to
listen

carey stood unnoticed in a corner
of the cabin he could see these
starmen now they had large scarred
hands and faces burned dark as old
leather their uniform jumpers were
worn and their boots were shabby and
they wore their greasy caps in a certain
way that carey remembered he saw
the sort of eyes they had too-and those
	startling stories

he remembered alao

  burke leaned forward across the
table he had an oblong face that was
mostly bone and sinew like the rest of
him and a hungry look around the
mouth all right he said now tell
us

  curt newton told them and as he
talked carey watched the starmen an
eerie feeling crept over him that he had
known these men before he had served
with them in the little ships that fought
their way along the planetary roads that
seemed then so long and hard it was
strange to see these men again to know
that they still lived he could almost
have called them by name except that
their faces had altered a bit and he could
not be sure

  burke was talking if they wont do
anything well have to do it ourselves
and we will im not going to sell our
ship to that pirate for a load of fuel
curt said the law-

to blazes with the law when it
starts protecting thieves instead of hon-
est men its time to forget the law
there was no cheering or loud talk
there was only a harsh mutter of assent

  listen curt saidyou cant smash
into the domes and take the fuel you
know what theyve got ready for you
we dont have to smash in said
eurke lowthers on his way here we
intercepted his message saying so well
he cant land behind the barrier there
isnt room

  curt nodded the same thing you
pulled with me get lowther in your
hands   

  and kill him if we have to burke
finished quietly but well get our fuel
for the first time simon spoke that
is murder

  burke shrugged theyll have to come
a long way to catch us he added in a
sudden fury murder is it weve got
our wives and families out there they
need the medicines the tools the seeds
what if they die for want of them  isnt
that murder too

  simon said if you kill lowther you
can never come back for more

  curt had got to hi feet he was about

to speak then carey heard a voice
clamoring over the annunciator crying
radar room weve just picked up
lowthers ship hes still in free fall
but hes coming

  carey saw the fierce excitement that
took the starmen there was a sudden
wolfish shouting a ringing of boots on
the deck-plates burke was yelling or-
ders the men in the passageways began
to move

  burke faced curt newton well
curt said hold your men back
there was a tenseness about him now
it seemed to carey that he was listening
for something hold them back
burkes face hardened i couldnt if
i wanted to he added slowly and mean-
ingly theyll trample anybody that
gets in their way

  he turned his back on newton then
and for a time nothing more was said
or done they listened to the voice of
the radar man calling out the position
of lowthers ship the voice became
more and more puzzled

  simons lens-like eyes were fixed in-
tently on curt newton

  hes still in free fall said the radar
man he hasnt started his curve yet
and the indicators dont show any rock-
ets

  burke put his mouth close to the
speaker-grid communications h e
said are you getting anything from
lowthers ship

  the answer came back no the
company station is calling lowther but
he doesnt answer its like he hasnt
any power

still no rockets said the radar man
i cant figure this one hes way past
his point of approach and going wide
still no signals put in communica-
tions he doesnt answer

  going wide- the voice of the radar
man reached a tight pitch of excitement
hes lost his landing-curve hes head-
ing right out into space with no rock-
ets

  for some odd reason curt newton
seemed to relax but burke and the
other officers stared at each other with
dawning comprehension and then with
earthmen no more	

a joy that was more savage than their
anger

  hes out of fuel said burke noth-
ing else would kill both his rockets and
communications hes out of fuel and
heading right out into the stars in free
fall with no power

  he began to walk back and forth with
short steps as though he could not bear
to be still his hands gripped fiercely at
the air we dont have to kill him now
its done and not a finger laid on him
and its better-better hell learn be-
fore he dies hell learn what it means
to be between the stars with no fuel
curt newton turned sharply toward
the door

  simon glided before him curtis he
said this is your doing

  curt said quietly get out of my way
simon im going after him

  burke heard so did the others carey
saw them move toward newton

 what do you mean-going after
him cried burke

  there are other men in that ship
besides lowther theres no reason why
they should die

  oh no said burke softly youre
not going to bring him back

  carey saw them closing in around
newton and he pushed in to stand with
otho beside the red-haired man

  listen said newton ive fought
for you im still fighting for you are
you going to trust me or arent you 
burkes glance wavered before his
but he said it dont make sense to
bring him back

  let him go said simon wright
slowly he has done this thing for you
now let him finish it

uncertainly reluctantly burke
stepped aside and curt newton
went out of the star-ship with carey
and otho and simon wright

  not until the comet was rising up
from pluto on a jet of flame rushing
out into the vast darkness where low-
thers helpless ship was gone did simon
speak again he asked tonelessly how
id you do it curtis

  newton shrugged but would not meet

his gaze theres a certain chemical
you know a pinch of which can kill a
whole tank of ship-fuel an anti-cata-
lytic well that night before we left
earth i slipped into lowthers ship and
used it to kill his number six seven
and eight fuel-tanks

  he shrugged again one to five
would take him out around neptune
i knew but then hed run out and
couldnt curve in toward pluto

  but why carey asked puzzedly
why do it and then save him

  simon said i can guess why but i
tell you curtis even if you succeed it
was harebrained once in the past your
rashness made outlaws of us four it
could happen again

  no more was said until curt new-
tons masterful piloting brought the
comet at last alongside the dark silent
ship that was steadily falling toward
infinity the emergency locks were
coupled together with magnetic grap-
ples curt and otho were armed and
grag stood behind them like an iron
colossus guarding the narrow passage

  the locks were opened and curt stood
facing lowther watching from the
background carey caught a glimpse of
lowthers face ugly with fear with
hatred

  i might have known it would be
you he said to curt newton you
caused our fuel to go dead how you did
it i dont know but-

  you cant prove that said newton
he spoke to the men who were crowd-
ing behind lowther take i easy he
told them youre in no danger

  a ray of hope crept into lowthers
eyes youre going to take us back
well said newton i cant tow
you for my stern-grapples arent work-
ing and my ship is small i could take
off your officers and crew but im afraid
there wouldnt be any room for you
lowther thought about that carey
could see it in his face-the visualization
of his ship plunging on and on into the
great deeps with him alone in it

  you couldnt do that he whispered
i wouldnt have any choice said
newton
	startling stories

  carey saw lowthers face whiten and
crumble until it was hardly human
then newton said however i might
sell you fuel to get back to pluto
shrewd and biting even through the
terror lowthers eyes fastened on him
now were getting to it he muttered
all right whats the price

  as you know said curt fuel is
very high these days but im not out
for profit you sign over all rights in
all your pluto mines and refineries to a
government foundation for the fur-
therance of travel and exploration
among the stars and ill let you have
a bunker full

  something like a smile touched low-
thers mouth he smothered it at once
beginning to protest and threaten but
curt shook his head oh no he said
there will be no repudiation of this
deal later on when youre safe on pluto
youre going to make out a full confes-
sion of your activities in gaining control
of the five other companies it will be
kept in a safe place and just to make
doubly sure  

   here he pointed to a fat-joweled little
man behind lowthers shoulder-a man
whom carey recognized as one of the
group who had been with lowther that
other time on earth

   to make doubly sure curt was
saying you will go into another cabin
and write out a separate confession as
lowthers secretary you know every
angle of that deal because you helped
him and if the two confessions dont
match i will know that someone is lying
-and that will be two people there
wont be room for in my ship

  he turned again to lowther and
waited three different times carey saw
lowther start to speak and give it up
at last he made a gesture of defeat and
curt motioned him into the comet the
secretary whimpered once and disap-
ipeared

next

  less than an hour later curt newton
had the signed irrevocable papers and
lowther had his fuel



  time had passed the two great ships
on the white plain of pluto were ready-
ing for take-off rock and ice quivered
to the deep hum of great generators
running on test men were feverishly
busy around the gangways

  carey came hastening across the ice
to where newton and the futuremen
were watching and as he ran he felt
buoyantly and fully alive for the first
time since his strange awakening

im going with them he cried i
talked to burke he signed me on and
im going with them-out to the stars
otho laughed and said to newton
you were right about him

  suddenly carey understood he said
thats why you brought me out here
with you you knew

  the red-haired man nodded i knew
that only out on the edge out on the
frontier would you find your own kind
again

  newton paused and added youre
not the only one carey ive seen it
happen over and over again to spacemen
in my own time they go out young and
eager dreaming and talking of how
someday theyll come back to earth
with wealth and glory and live there
happy the rest of their lives and when
they come back they find they cant do
it they find theyre earthmen no more
earthmen no more carey repeat-
ed wonderingly why yes that was
it of course it wasnt earth that
changed so much it was me

  from the distance amplified by an
annunciator loudspeaker roared burkes
voice time to lift starmen

  and carey slipping and hurrying
went back across the frozen plain to-
ward the ships and stars that waited

greetings

margaret st clair

science discovers
the secret of
mutual lepulsionl

kyle sat in a pool of light the rest
of the dim room glittered with
gold braid he felt a littte hysterical he
said im sorry gentlemen but i dont
see the bearing of your questions i
dont believe it could possibly be used
as a weapon

never mind that the cool voice
said kyle could not see any of their

faces distinctly that is our problem
not yours but can we take it that the
description here-he tapped the copy of
the march issue of scientia nova which
lay before him on the long table-is
substantially correct

  yes sir as far as it goes

i must say im disappointed gentle-
men an older voice broke in i had


	startling stories

understood the effect was to make them
fight they dont fight

  kyle was not sure who had spoken
he turned to face the direction from
which he thought the voice had come
no sir i dont think it would be pos-
sible to make the animals fight you see
in order to fight theyd have to come
into contact and thats just what they
dont want to do

  the effect is not to cause hostility
but a strong really a very strong mutual
repulsion they behave like-like bodies
with the same electrical charge

  a moment ago you said the account
in the magazine was correct as far as
it went said the cool voice do you
mean that you have made additional
experiments since have you tried
your invention on the higher animals
its not an invention-i beg your
pardon sir but i myself have as yet no
clear idea how the effects are produced
yes i have made a number of experi-
ments with mammals including three
rhesus monkeys

  a ripple of excitement ran along the
shadowy table and what was the
result the cool voice asked

  i got no result at all with the lower
frequencies the frequencies to which
the lizards had responded higher fre-
quencies had the usual effect i dont
want to generalize without more data
but it looks as if there might be a re-
lationship between the frequencies to
which an animal would respond and the
degree of its cortical development
somebody cleared his throat the
elderly voice said you mean you got
the monkeys to fight

  no sir they didnt fight what they
did was break open the cage i still dont
know how they managed it-it was re-
inforced steel mesh one of the monkeys
stayed in the cage i found another at
the end of the laboratory as far from
the cage as she could get

  the third monkey the one we called
rita got out of the lab somehow she
must have hurt herself doing it-there
was considerable bleeding i dont know
where she went i havent been able
to locate her yet

alow-pitched hum of talk broke
out kyle shutting his eyes
against the flood of light that fell
around his chair-the only bright light
in the big room-thought he could make
out a word now and then

  the public    opinion  no op-
position    humane he thought he
heard the last word over and over again

  a voice kyle had not heard before
a voice with great authority said can
mr kyle tell us whether this mutual
repulsion is permanent

  kyle opened his eyes blinking until
two days ago sir he said i should
not have been able to answer the ques-
tion but on thursday i observed that
the phase of repulsion had been suc-
ceeded in the guinea pigs by an anti-
phase in which the social instincts were
considerably exaggerated when one of
them was taken away from the group it
showed marked distress and attempted
to bite

  most interesting said the author-
itative voice that removes the final
objection to my mind

  of course said kyle forgetting his
instructions which had been to speak
only when he was addressed i cant
say how long this anti-phase may last
or what might succeed it

  several people cleared their throats
the cool voice said you may go now
mr kyle

  kyle got to his feet he was stiff
from nervous tension and fatigue as
he approached the door the agents who
had brought him to the nonagon fell in
on either side of him

  when they were outside the door the
taller agent said youre to go with us
kyle well take you to your new lab


  she loved them vinnie thought she
just loved all of them how right father
glorious had been love was the golden
key that unlocked the heart of each and
every one of gods creatures

  what had the white lady on the second
floor in millinery said this morning
something about how vinnie was the
little girl with the big friendly smite
then fly our greetings



that was a nice thing to think about
if you loved people theyd never hurt
you it just went to show

  watch your step please watch your
step vinnie said opening the elevator
door with her thin brown hand she
tried to put the love abounding father
glorious was always talking about into
her voice

  her back did hurt but you oughtnt
to let material things bother you-
father said so besides it was closing
time for the store shed only have to
make one or two more trips today
watch your step vinnie sang please
watch your step

  she closed the door and started back
to the third floor for more passengers

car as far from each other as they could
get was something going to happen
something terrible-an earthquake a
hurricane

  the elevator reached the mezzanine
vinnie opened the door watch your
step please she said her voice coming
out higher than she had intended it
please wa- her voice broke off

  she felt a sensation so strong that
it was translated into an emotion in-
stantly it was intenser than anything
she had yet experienced in her eighteen
years for a moment she was a jelly of
confusion and bewilderment who was
-what-what  her mind swayed like
a balancing toy then it righted itself

  get out she said to her passengers

weapons of destruction-

  r ts a safe bet that every one of us alive at present is pondering the in-
  sane search for more efficient weapons with which too many of our
  ablest creative brains are occupied at present since hiroshima the vision
  of a lethally volatile peach-colored mushroom-shaped cloud has overshad-
  owed a great many billions of waking hours-and perhaps as many after dark

     but there are other even deadlier possibilities mrs st clair here in
  then fly our greetings presents one that is no more improbable than
  the potential of hundreds of projects now operative behind the guarded
  doors of laboratories not only in the united states but virtually in every
  nation of the so-calld civiliied world

nobody was going up but plenty were
coming down they crowded into the
elevator pushing talking laughing
complaining one of the little girls be-
gan to cry vinnie tried to radiate love-
abounding out to her

  she opened the cage on second to take
on two more passengers please step
back in the car vinnie said

  as the cage moved slowly downward
from second to mezzanine vinnie felt
a sudden stab of pain in the back of her
head for a moment it sickened her
her hands shook on the cars controls
she looked around her hoping nobody
had noticed it shed get fired if she
took sick

  how white everybody was a bleached
fish-belly white they looked like they
were scared and quiet-there wasnt
a whisper in the car even the children
were still they all seemed to have
pushed back against the walls of the

get out all of you you just get right
on out she made wide gestures with
her hands

  they had begun to move seeing the
open door before she spoke to them
they poured over the elevator sill rub-
bing against the edge of the door in
their reciprocal aversion and scattered
through the mezzanine as their dis-
tance from each other increased they
began to run

yinnie watched them incredulously
what was the matter with them
with her why had she spoken to them
like that she couldnt help but be fired
when shed talked to white folks like
that

  she sank back against the side of the
elevator car weeping it was hard to
get a job these days she must be crazy
what had happened her head ached so

  she pressed her hands against her
	startling stories

face and cried harder yes crazy it
was terrible terrible what had come
over her but underneath her confusion
and distress there was an indestructible
kernel of another emotion it was won-
derful it was like the peace of god
father glorious was always talking
about not to have anybody near her
it was wonderful to be alone in the
elevator car



  the baby had begun to cry tanya
listened for a moment and then decided
that it must be time to feed him where
had she left the mask the nurse had
given her

  she found it in a cupboard and looked
at it doubtfully it was dirty perhaps
she ought to wash it but the baby had a
cold anyhow what was the use of wear-
ing it

  she approached the crib unbuttoning
her blouse

  she picked the baby up his crying
hushed

  little apple she said to him smil-
ing mamas little man

  tanya had no warning as vinnie had
had she felt no premonitory stab of
pain in the head nothing the confusion
burst upon her unheralded

  for an instant she stood rooted be-
side the cradle the child had begun to
scream at the top of his lungs arching
his small body away from her desper-
ately hush she tried to say hush
little blossom but her lips refused to
shape the words

  she wanted to scream she wanted to
jump through the window she wanted
to take a knife and kill herself still she
remained beside the cradle holding the
shrieking child instinct education
physiology were warring with the new
force in her her face was beaded with
sweat

  abruptly she dropped the child he
fell back on the pillows of the crib with
a thump that made him stop crying for
a second tanya looked down at him
moaning and wringing her hands then
she began to back away from him when
she reached the door of the flat she
tamed and ran through it



  he kissed the tip of each finger he
put a cluster of kisses in the soft flesh
of the palm he encircled the ring
finger wearing the new gold wedding
ring with a chain of tiny kisses he
said tu maimes

  her eyes were shining she laid her
right hand softly against his cheek
francois tu le sais   

  their lips met presently he said
take off your jacket cherie i find it
an embarrassment

  she laughed she began to unbutton
the high-collared close-fitting jacket of
dove colored cloth smiling at him teas-
ingly she had not reached the fourth
button before he took her once more
in his arms

  abruptly they drew away from each
other her jaw dropped she put out
her hand toward him and then let it
fall he said i-what-marie

  she licked her lips he had turned
very pale with a convulsive effort he
touched her shoulder with one finger-
tip she jerked away from the contact
as if his hand had been red hot

  they stood staring at each other
her hands pressed against her temples
desperately he said in a croak i dont
understand you are still so beautiful
she made no answer for a moment
longer they faced each other then she
turned and ran into the bathroom he
heard the door click as she locked it
behind her then he too ran



  the new recruits were a very promis-
ing lot sergeant ma thought they had
the short stocky well-set-up build he
liked to see and they were willing eager
for education too-theyd beamed all
over their faces when he told them about
the plan for the new learning theyd
soon master the thousand signs

  number off he barked at them as
they formed up in a wavering line
they counted to twenty but the next
man didnt know what came after it
ma had expected the difficulty he sup-
plied the ensuing numbers himself
theyd soon learn yesterday they had
then fly our greetings	

only got to seventeen

  right dress he said haltingly they
obeyed yes they were a sharp lot

  the drill continued at ease ma
said finally gratefully they relaxed ma
began to lecture them

  the first duty of a soldier he said
powerfully is obedience the sage tells
us that the excellence of things is their
undoing but in a peoples army ex-
cellence   

  he finished his talk saying that is
why drill is so important from it we
learn obedience shoulder arms form
fours

  with a good deal of jerky trotting the
recruits moved into place their faces
were intent and serious his talk had
done them good they were trying
harder than yesterday forward
march ma shouted at them

last week the drill ground had been
a sea of mud it would be a sea of
mud again with the next rain it was
dry now each time the recruits feet
came down on the dry earth dust arose
ma began to sneeze

  he pressed his finger to his upper
lip to stop the sneezing narrowing his
eyes he peered through the dust fog at
the men the bones of his face ached

  column right ma yelled at the
soldiers the column hesitated made the
turn then to mas stupefaction the
men began to run

  they spread out from each other in
a fan-shape they dropped their guns
in the dust as they ran one man stum-
bled and fell then another those be-
hind swerved away from them auto-
matically without touching them even
in the midst of mas general astonish-
ment this blind avoidance appeared to
him a remarkable thing

  the last of the fugitives was dis-
appearing dismissed ma shouted
after him in a desperate attempt to
regularize an unregularizable situation
there was no sign that he had been
heard

  the dust was beginning to settle ma
looked up wildly at the sky as if he ex-
pected to find some clue in it to what

had happened the blue serene depths
were empty there was not even a plane

  had he dreamed it no there were
discarded rifles all over the drill ground
it had happened ma shuddered what
would happen next anything-any-
thing could happen now



  the military mind kyle thought as
he tried to stop his nervous shivering
the military mind tended to be an im-
compatible mixture of hidebound con-
servatism and buck rogers foolishness
it was like hitching a jet plane to an
oxcart and you never knew which
would predominate

  the basic aim behind the research
task they had set him had been laudable
to produce a truly humane weapon-
yes indeed it was for this that he had
submitted to the questioning at the end
of each days work questioning which
made him feel like an aphid being
milked by ants hed tried hard and be-
sides the problem had been interesting
so it was partly his fault

  he looked around the laboratory the
animals in the cages slept ate or bick-
ered unconcernedly the rats in the cor-
ner were mating it wasnt affecting
them that was clear

  if only the people over kyle had
waited waited until hed had time to
test and check but theyd been in a
hurry and they hadnt had imagination
enough-perhaps no one could have had
-to foresee what would happen theyd
come up with this

  once more kyle tried to turn on the
radio it was no use his physiological
aversion to getting near an electrical
device was still too strong to be con-
trolled he couldnt make himself turn
the switch it probably wouldnt have
been any use anyhow if other people
were affected by electrical devices as he
was nothing could be coming over the
radio

  he couldnt stop shaking a drink
might help him he got a flask of ab-
solute alcohol from a cupboard poured
two tablespoons into a glass and filled
the glass with water to the brim when
	startling stories

he took the glass from his lips it was
empty his body had wanted that drink

  the physiological craving for alcohol
the aversion to electricity might be
significant there was something of
more immediate consequence though-
the weak water pressure hed noticed
when he was filling the glass he got
all the empty carboys he could find and
filled them by the time the last was
corked no more water was coming from
the tap

  kyle felt better he had almost
stopped shaking he looked at his watch
frowned listened to it no it was still
going it was really only three hours
since merilee one of his assistants had
pressed her hands to her head and then
run out of the lab the other two as-
sistants had been out on errands they
had not come back

  hadnt come back was too melo-
dramatic no doubt they were still rea-
sonably safe and sound provided the
guard in the corridor with the bar
hadnt shot them but it had been a long
time since kyle had heard a shot

  meanwhile the question was-could
he sit this one out he had a good deal
of water and though the only conven-
tional food in the laboratory was half of
the box of soda crackers merilee had
been chewing on at noon there were the
cages of lab animals one could kyle
supposed eat white rats in a pinch

  if he sat tight he might be able to get
along until the anti-phase set in the
rhesus monkeys had exhibited a strong-
ly marked anti-phase human beings
could be expected to do so too but while
he was engaged in sitting tight what
would be happening to everyone

  the extent of the catastrophe was ex-
traordinarily hard to realize always
before in the worst of human plights
little nodes of cooperation and unity had
continued to exist kyle found that
while he could visualize the disjunction
which was taking place immediately
around him well enough as soon as he
tried to apply the principle on a wide
scale his mind slipped back into its
habitual expectation of organization and
mutual action

and yet it was in the highest degree
unlikely it was surely impossible
that what was happening in washington
was an isolated case the military had
been aiming at a particular target area
the projector had been over-powered
kyle had tried to point out this danger
the last time he had been up before the
staff the backlash from the projec-
tor had enveloped washington probably
most of the rest of the globe had suf-
fered first

  it had sounded like a humane weapon
military opposition could not exist when
human beings were unable to tolerate
one anothers proximity but-kyle
mixed himself another drink of stock-
room alcohol and downed it avidly-the
effects of the new weapon would prob-
ably turn out to be more dreadful than
the plagues of the middle ages

  the plague fear had sent human
beings fleeing wildly from one another
but even in their panic they had acted
by twos and threes affection fidelity
self-interest had bound them to each
other now every man fled from every
other man

  instinctive self-preservation moti-
vated their repulsion kyle had made
the experiment of forcibly placing lab
animals near one another after he had
used his small projector on them they
had in every case died and when he
had dissected them he had found that
gross changes had taken place in the
brain itself lesions that had been caused
by this proximity

   no he couldnt sit this one out it was
too much his fault though the thought
of approaching one of his fellow men
filled him with sickening apprehension
kyle found his social instinct was as
strong as ever curious-it was un-
likely he could help very much but he
was under an obligation to try what he
could do

  cautiously he opened the lab door
there was an immediate rattle of
bullets against it kyle slammed the
door sweating the bar man was still
out in the hall

  kyle felt no animus against him if
he himself had bad a gun hed certainty
then fly our greetings	

have shot at anyone who tried to come
near him but the presence of the bar
man meant that kyle would have to get
out through the window and he had
always had a poor head for heights
fortunately he was only on the fourth
floor

  he started toward the opening hesi-
tated on impulse he went to one of the
cabinets and got a case of dissecting
scalpels and lancets from it it was
getting too dark for him to read the
labels on bottles but he sniffed at several
until he found what he wanted a flask
with the pleasant odor of chloroform
he put the scalpels and the bottle in
opposite pockets carefully he let him-
self down over the window sill

  the nonagon building was generally
admitted to be a first class eyesore but
now kyle blessed the anonymous archi-
tect who had covered its surface with
knops festoons ribbons gargoyles and
acanthus leaves cast in concrete there
were plenty of hand and foot holds and
if he kept his mind strictly on descend-
ing his acrophobia could be controlled
once or twice he felt the terrible con-
striction and sense of heat in his skull
that told him other human beings were
near

  when he was about twenty feet fcom
the ground the concrete festooning gave
out feel about below him as he would
his feet met nothing but a perpendicular
granite surface hed have to drop

  he made himself relax for the fall
but when he picked himself up he found
that his left ankle had been badly
wrenched when he tried to stand on it
the pain was so intense it made him
faint he got out a scalpel and cut his
vest into strips with it then he band-
aged his ankle with the cloth when he
was done he could stand on the foot
without too much pain

  the moon was coming up kyle wasnt
supposed to know where the projector
building was but secrets do leak out it
was a long way to walk but he couldnt
bring himself to try to start a car
shaking and sweating he began to hob-
ble along

  he had walked for perhaps a quarter

of a mile detouring when he sensed
someone near him when he heard the
nasty pock-pock of bullets up ahead

  it was a man with a tommy-gun
there were two bodies on the pave-
ment in front of him his gun was in
shadow but he seemed to be shooting
in through an open window no doubt
there was somebody inside somebody
whose mere existence was an intoler-
able affliction for the man with the gun

  kyle bit his lip he could detour but
the man with the gun would probably
start shooting at him anyway also a
gun would be very useful to kyle was
it possible that the gunner was so oc-
cupied for the nonce with extermination
that kyle could get reasonably close
without being noticed if he moved
quickly he would try

  the gunner spun about still spurting
bullets just as kyle threw the bottle
with the chloroform

the bottle broke on the pavement
kyle pressed back against the side
wall as tightly as he could the gunner
could not see him of course but he
would have a very accurate notion of
where he was bullets began to pock
and jar against the stone cornice

  the burst flagged renewed itself
flagged again kyle stuck his head
around the corner the gunner was
sinking drunkenly on one knee he fired
a last burst and collapsed kyle could
smell the fumes of the chloroform from
where he stood

  the pain in kyles skull was terrible
apparently even an unconscious man
was still a potential source of brain
damage while kyle was stripping the
gunner of gun and ammunition he won-
dered whether he would ever be able to
think normally again

  after he had carried his booty to a
safe distance he had to rest for what
seemed a long time he collected him-
self at last and started hobbling toward
the projector building once more

  the projector was housed in a small
two-story building that had once been
a local sub-station power house in a
residential district in various devious
	startling stories

ways the department of defense had
acquired title to the ex-sub station and
the buildings which stood near it

  these buildings had been boarding
houses before they changed ownership
and they continued to pass as boarding
houses after the department of defense
acquired them but a rather strictly
selected group of boarders lived in
them

  if kyle had got to the projector build-
ing three hours even two hours earlier
he would have found himself in the
midst of a bitter small-scale version of
modern warfare the men on whom the
task of guarding the projector had de-
volved had managed since they were
specially selected personnel to endure
each others proximity for almost forty
seconds before they began shooting

  in their frenzy of extermination they
had also used their grenades and flame
throwers but by now everything was
quiet and nothing moved in the street
kyle found that the bodies bothered
him very little even in a sentimental
way

  he stood before the darkened build-
ing while a wind whipped lightly at his
trouser legs and tried to think he had
been told that the projector had its own
power source and was in no way de-
pendent on city installation

  the projector was certainly not func-
tioning now or he would never have
been able to get so near it that was
natural enough-he had found with his
small projector that a twenty-second
exposure had quite as much effect as one
of several minutes no doubt the big
installation had been switched off im-
mediately when the minimum period
was over

  what was it he had wanted to do
oh yes this week-last week-some
time recently at any rate there seemed
to be a permanent confusion inside his
skull-he had found that a certain
sequence of frequencies from the pro-
jector tended to undo the polarization
effect on the nerve cells

  at least he had observed such a re-
version to normality in one of the rhesus
monkeys and microscopic examination

of the animals brain had confirmed the
observation it wasnt much to go on
certainly kyle would have liked to make
many more tests but there wasnt time
to make careful tests now hed have to
try to see what he could do

  he went up to the door to his sur-
prise it opened easily he stood blink-
ing for a moment seeking to accustom
himself to the sudden darkness after
the moonlight of the street outside
presently he saw that the interior was
not quite dark-there was a very dim
blue glow up ahead almost simultane-
ously with his perception of the light he
realized that there was a man in the
building

  a bullet spat past his cheek kyle
felt a certain surprise at the inaccuracy
of the shooting then he saw the mans
faint silhouette against the light and
understood the man had been wounded
in the right shoulder he was shooting
with his left hand

  kyle was thinking as clearly as he
could he himself didnt want to shoot
if it could be avoided he might miss
and damage the projector

  he yelled come out i wont hurt
you i want to-try to-fix things up 
im going to-stop-this mess

  there was a seconds silence and then
a new rattle of bullets from his oppo-
nents gun above the noise kyle heard
the man screaming something that
sounded like you spy you god-
damned spy

it couldnt be avoided kyle perceived
now that he had to act he felt a vast
remote calm like that which comes at
certain stages of drunkenness with a
sensation of almost godlike detatchment
he took careful aim he would hit the
man in the heart

  he fired six shots his opponent was
screaming in a scratchy high-pitched
voice each bullet went into his body
with what seemed almost a petulant
thud there was a sudden bursting
silence as the man went backward with
the impact kyle lowered his gun and
waited frozenly

  the man by the projector clawed him-
then fly our greetings	s

self into a kneeling position he fired
one last shot not at kyle the slug went
into the projector with a jangling crash

of glass

  there was a noiseless flash of light
not very intense then even the dim
glow went out

  kyle groped his way through the
choking darkness to the projector he
lit matches and examined it the damage
was serious two of the big tubes were
glinting bits of glass on the pavement
and the wiring had shorted in three
places as least

  was it hopeless not under ordinary
conditions the big tubes were special
jobs but more could have been made in
a week or two the technicians who had
installed the wiring could have repaired
it but the man whom kyle had just
shot was perhaps the last of the tech-
nicians and the cooperative labor which
had shaped the tubes was now unthink-
able

  unthinkable-hopeless-irreparable
the words seemed to flit about in the
darkness of the building endlessly like
pairs of leathery wings kyle lit match
after match hoping to find something
he could do for the projector some re-
pair however useless that he could
make there was nothing-he could not
find anything

  hopeless the last match burned to
his fingers hopeless-irreparable-
unthinkable standing there in the dark-
ness weary spent and dazed kyle be-
gan to weep



  the water in the carboy was foul had
been foul for days it would hardly go
through the filter paper any longer
there was only about an inch of it left

  he wasnt hungry that was odd he
hadnt been hungry since the first re-
pulsion phase perhaps the alcohol he
had drunk-it was all gone now-had
helped

  whatever the reason kyle had no
desire for food though he had lost a good
deal of weight but he wanted a bath
he wanted to be immersed to the chin
in water generous ungrudging water
and let it soak in through his pores he

wanted gallons and gallons of water to
drink

  hed go down to the river tonight
with the carboys he decided as the
phases alternated human beings found
that the distance at which they could
tolerate each other continually in-
creased but he still had his gun and
two clips of bullets for it he would try

  he poured the water that had seeped
through the filter paper into a glass and
sipped at it it took all of his self-con-
trol to keep from gulping it he tipped
the glass vertically to get the last pre-
cious drop when he put it down reluc-
tantly he felt the tightness and peculiar
empty feeling in his brain that told him
a new anti-phase was setting in

  he hoped not how many anti-phases
would this be now the third or the
fourth he tried to count though the
events of the last month-months-
whatever it was-were a meaningless
jumble it was the fourth-no this must
be anti-phase three

  he remembered the first anti-phase
pretty well he had been sitting in the
lab sipping what was nearly the last of
the alcohol when hed become aware of
a peace almost a harmony in his brain
it made him feel good he thought for
a moment that the treatment he had
managed to give himself with the small
projector battery powered had been a
success

  the feeling had got stronger turned
into a hunger a necessity he hadnt
tried to fight it when he realized it was
the anti-phase he had been glad be-
cause he had hoped the new phase might
mean the beginning of a return to nor-
mality

  as if driven by some instinct they had
met in the clear area where the non-
agon had parked its car most of the
cars were still there dust-filmed rain-
spotted here and there a little touched
with rust there had been perhaps five
hundred of the survivors how they had
clung together in their new-found amity
their aching need

  kyle remembered most vividly from
that anti-phase the woman with the
silver fox stole and how she had clung
	startling stories

to the fat negro woman next to her i
love you she had cried her face
shining oh i love you youre wonder-
ful and the negress beaming with
reciprocal affection had answered me
too yessum me too

  that phase had ended

  after it there had come the new re-
pulsion-more severe-the new anti-
phase the new repulsion and now the
new anti-phase how he hated it

  kyle could not resist it he ran past
the swollen bodies in the hall down the
stair jumping over the things on the
landings he plunged down the last
flight two three steps at a time hurry
hurry hurry his brain said hurry-
you love them so

they were clustered together like
bats in a cavern like bees in the
wintertime if it were possible to use
this phase somehow he thought as he
plastered himself wildly against the
quivering mass use it to rebuild all that
has been destroyed to put a stop-at
least-to what was still going on use
it but how

  they ached to get closer to each other
to be interpenetrated with each others
beings they were straining and grunt-
ing in their communal embrace those
at the center of the mass kyle thought
must be half crushed and stifled but
there were fewer than there had been in
the last anti-phase in the shaking clus-
ter last time there must have been at
least two hundred people now there
might be eighty left

  the face of the man on kyles left
was familiar he might have known him
once kyle said-not really wanting to
speak feeling as if the words had been
extracted with forceps from his brain
-isnt it wonderful being all together
again now were more than we were
separately were the group

  the man opened his eyes and looked
at kyle he had a sad lined middle-aged
face he said you know this isnt like
the other phases something new is hap-
pening dont you feel it were really
going to become just one person this
time all of us just one

  maybe if we try hard that one new
person can fix things hed be wiser than
any of us separately wouldnt he i
cant stand much more of this

  the words filled kyle with desperate
energy he said yes yes lets try im
sure youre right well try tell the
person next to you

  the news went buzzing around the
cluster struck inward they all heard
it they all agreed the moments lin-
gered the strain increased the man
next to kyle said at last do you feel
it at the back of your skull-new
circuits a new type of consciousness
kyle licked his lips he wanted to
reply it had seemed to him as the strain-
ing moments passed that new regions
new dimensions were opening strange-
ly in his brain or was it space itself
that divided in a panorama of planes
which echoed one another to infinity

  it was as if explorers touched the dark
continents within his skull and estab-
lished cities there and from the blank
headlands now touched with light from
the tributary cities something was flow-
ing out toward the others and uniting
with them

  kyle had a sudden vision of a crea-
ture vaster than one of the anakim it
stood on earth laughing and stretched
its fingers out toward saturn the thin
winds of heaven rustled through the
flames of its hair it was wiser stronger
more joyous than humanity

  was this new entity what the sad
man had meant oh it must be so
surely this creation so much greater
than the sum of its creators would yet
obey them could be impressed to do
their will

  the minds of those in the group were
flowing together to make something un-
heard of their wills had coalesced and
what they were making would be able
to solve with almost godlike ease what
they had in their miserable isolation
found insoluble

  the sad mans question no longer
needed answering kyle felt his
identity leaving him and for a moment
he was terrified who was he what
would he become he struggled then
then fly our greetings	

he was caught up into a blazing unity
his last conscious awareness was of a
prospect of gigantic delight



  who was kyle as member after
member of the group fell away dying
of exhaustion hunger exposure thirst
the question could be asked who was
kyle

  he looked about him numbly the air
was thin and cold his body seemed
strange to him

  at the back of his dim half-burned-
out brain there was a recollection of
titanic splendors of inhuman experi-
ence he seemed to remember exer-
tions beyond the scope of imagination
an urge which had shaken someone
vaster than himself a great an incred-
ible enterprise who was kyle

he was standing in the midst of a
huge plain at the foot of a tower-
ing monolith without comprehension
his eyes followed the shaft up up up
to where it seemed to split the sky who
could have reared such a shaft far off
on the flat horizon another towered into
the heavens and at the very limit of
visibility he saw still another

  it was cold so cold kyle shivered
uncontrollably there was no warmth in
the dim yellow sun

  once more his eyes went up the shaft
of the monolith he looked at it blankly
slack-lipped and slowly little by little
that part of his brain which had not
been destroyed began to understand the
monoliths   

  there had been an anti-phase but
this time humanity had been welded to-
gether indissolubly they could not flee
from each other they had not even

wanted to the repulsion had taken a
new direction been transferred group
after group over the face of the globe
their minds had flowed into each others
to become fused in a super-mind and
that mind compelled by the wills that
composed it had built

  the human beings who composed it
had been the cells of its tangible body
it had used them mercilessly sleepless
tireless mindless they had labored
they were expendable-they had been
expended

  it was they who had reared the
monoliths

  but to what purpose kyle found that
he was very tired he was so tired that
the cold no longer seemed bitter to him
sighing with fatigue he stretched out
on the ground beside the monolith how
dim the sun was he could look up at it
open-eyed

  that he supposed was why they had
built the monoliths so they could leave
the sun the sun was dim because they
were far from it that must have been
the effect of the last anti-phase the last
repulsion-an impulse to build the pow-
er towers that would drive earth away
from the other planets and its home star
the sun

  now he was so tired that it didnt
matter-now earth was flying outward
from its place in the solar system on
and on in that last gigantic repulsion
into the empty interstellar dark

  it would get colder on earth every-
thing was finished the seas would
freeze and then at last the air it was
all over it wasnt important he sighed
and shivered what mattered the vital
thing was the answer to the enigma
that still vexed him who-who was
kyle

a novelet by william f temple

a poet a pragomatist and a
girl-they were all
that was left of humanity
after earth became a
second sun-and mars was
far from the
garden of edeni

the idea that the world may someday
and quite literally be blown up is
scarcely a new one most of the ancient re-
ligions had it however of recent years
the doomsday legend has taken on new form
and entirely new impact for according to
the sundry tenets of yore it ivas the gods
who led the world to its final ruin through
their own folly-usually a result of meddl-
ing in mortal conflicts

  nowadays the vision of worlds end is all
too clear-and man himself is the agent
having abandoned the superfollc of olympus
and valhalla we have only ourselves to
blame

  however lingering as stubbornly as
mans belief in an individual life-after-
death is an insistent thread of hope that

such destruction will not be co-mplete-that
somewhere on or under earth or perhaps
upon one of the planets some humans ukll
somehow survive to create a more equable
cosmos for themselves mr temple in this
story gives vivid presentation to how such
survival might be accomplished-the

chapter i

survivors

 blessed necessity cried leo-
nardo da vinci in his day know-
ing that it was the prime incentive man
had to be driven to work his best mira-
cles creditors at ones heels were a
sharper spur to the artist than his own
inspiration

  the first voyage from earth to mars
was certainly not the fruit of a hunger
for knowledge-or of technicians in love
with their work-or even of pride seek-
ing power upon which to fatten

  it sprang from the starkest of all ne-
cessities-preservation of the species

  a divided earth struggling with a
divided mind to preserve itself had
fallen into the desperate error of pre-
ventive war the disease germs as thick
as clouds in the atmosphere were prov-

ing to be the conquerors of both sides
earth quivering under the impacts of
countless atomic missiles many darted
into its side by its own satellite and hu-
man colony flung out a seed

  the seed was styled the nuova vita
-as a sign that the earth really knew
better than it had behaved-and it was
a rocket-ship five times the size of the
lunar vessels it had both atomic and
chemical drives it had come straight
off the drawing board its size and pow-
er were unprecedented there was no
time for real tests in effect it was a
tissue of theory launched naked into


	startling stories

cold space carrying twenty-six souls
and the hope of the human race-at
least the anglo-american part of that
race

  the gamble it seemed had come off
the seed missed the stony places-it
was landing on the comparatively fer-
tile soil of mars it was a thousand feet
above that soil sitting on its tail of
braking chemical jets descending with
beautifully slow deliberation

  the pilot said happily weve done
it

  fate never likes to be anticipated a
second later came a great light and a
great heat the habitually almost mo-
tionless atmosphere of mars was
scorched and stung into agitation the
heated air expanded almost like an ex-
plosion tearing the concentrated gas-
jets of the ship into long tenuous
streamers

  the nuova vita tilted irrevocably off
balance it became a bone of contention
between gravity and the upstreaming
air its majesty had departed it was
a straw tossed by forces it had lately
controlled

  they tossed it into a grassy area two
earth-miles from an ice-blue channel
but the soil was thin there was hard
rock beneath it and the rock broke the
back of the nuova vita it broke the
backs of many of the little humans with-
in and others died through the sheer
concussion

  the wind howled over the wreck un-
der the sun-and under the small new-
born companion to the sun

thomas jefferson johns ran

for his life among the firs luckily
the snow hadnt come yet but the bit-
ter wind driving against his face
was the herald of it there was plenty
of snow on the saw-edged peaks of the
rockies distant behind him

  unhappily not so far behind him
came the grizzly bear

  he looked back fearfully over his
shoulder to see who was gaining he
never saw because he ran his head
against a branch and was knocked off
hie feet flat on his back he went and

the ground seemed to be rocking like a
boat beneath him one side of his head
felt as though it were bursting open
much more of this and he would be
sick

  the great head of the grizzly with
its small eyes and licking red tongue
loomed over him he felt too ill to care
now the beast put its paws on his
shoulders began to shake him

  dont dont-youre hurting my
head john cried foolishly

  the bear seemed to go misty at the
edges become a mere dark form that
was shaking him then it stopped and
was still and he lay back his eyes grad-
ually refocusing it

  it wasnt a bear now it was a big
dark man with an olive skin and con-
temptuous brown eyes-john mala-
testa

  malatesta the real world returned
to him now malatesta schultz mar-
tin haywood liza pinky kilpatrick
danby foster   

  there had been twenty-six of them
including himself the big business
man the chemist the engineer the ag-
riculturist the physician the geologist
the cook the bacteriologist the artist
-and the rest all hand-picked albeit
hastily by a harassed government for
their qualifications to start a new
growth of mankind and yet preserve
some of the knowledge and culture
from the main stem which was dying

  he johns had been picked not mere-
ly because of his fame as a poet or be
cause he was a nobel prize winner for
literature but because also he had once
been a teacher and a noteworthy educa-
tionalist

  how far malatesta had been picked
and how far he had pulled strings to
force his election into the chosen few
was not known to anyone on the ship
but malatesta himself he had qualifi-
cations of course he was the chief of
a huge organization in the states with
his organizing ability went toughness
of mind and body and immense drive
he was the man to get things done
the only drawback was-the things had
to be done his way
the two

  still he was in a minority and could
be curbed there were other tough peo-
ple on the ship particularly judge hack-
man

  johns struggled to sit up there was
a thin cold wind blowing

  thats better said malatesta but
take it easy theres no hurry weve
got all the time there is

  johns held his aching head-very
lightly because it was painful to touch

  what hit me

  mars want to hit it back

  johns shook his head and wished he
hadnt more carefully he turned it to
look around again he wished he hadnt

  this crazy tangle of broken alloy
with sharp swords of steel bristling
from it had been the main cabin once
he had seen a car wreck in which the
two vehicles had met head on at the ag-
gregate speed of a hundred and twenty
miles an hour this was worse and
bigger and there were a lot more bodies
-and parts of bodies

  oh he said and suddenly the nau-
sea he had dreamed of returned and was
made actual

  gasping for breath afterwards he
turned red wet eyes on malatesta

  tender stomach eh said mala-
testa with cynical amusement ill
break it to you gently son you and
me are the only two left alive and im
not too sure about you

  johns could only stare at him schulta
martin haywood liza pinky kilpat-
rick danby foster  all those who
had become his friends sharing this
unparalleled adventure-carrying the
torch for humanity together-full of
a sense of nobility and responsibility
-kindly and tolerant indeed loving to-
ward one another because they had a
common aim in life a great aim and
were there to help each other toward
it

  all killed on the march by one sense-
less blow their aspirations mocked
by fate and thrown on this ghastly
scrapheap

  all-except himself and malatesta
the one man he had regarded with an-
tipathy and avoided

shadows	

  he laid his head on his arm and
cried like a child who has suddenly dis-
covered that the entire family has gone
out and left him alone in the house-
except for the big rough dog he dis-
likes and fears

  good said malatesta keep it up
were short of water the tank got
busted and its all gone into the ground

presently johns looked up and
found he was alone except for-
he got dizzily to his feet and scram-
bled out of that horrible place and away
from the broken ship it was surpris-
ingly easy he seemed to flutter in long
jumps like a goose of course the lesser
gravitation   

  this was mars-just a lot of thin
sick-looking grass spreading in all di-
rections the sky was a very dark tblue
almost black overhead where faint
stars twinkled there was a singing
in his ears which he had noticed at high
altitudes in the rockies it came from
the low air density

  then he noticed that springing at
thirty degrees from each other from
his feet across the grass were two
shadows one fainter than the other
and despite the chill breeze there was
warmth on the back of his neck

  he turned there were two suns
hanging in the sky bright and white
both were considerably smaller than
the sun he had known on earth and
one of them was appreciably smaller
than the other

  he was no astronomer but he real-
ized there was something definitely out
of order here however before he could
think about it much malatesta came up
in long floating strides from somewhere
along the great length of wreckage

  since youre up he said you can
give me a hand with things well what
do you think of mars

  johns gestured toward the two suns
i dont get that

  malatesta said perhaps youre not
quite awake yet its obvious enough
i told you-you and me are the only two
left alive-anywhere

  johns grappled with his incredulity
	startling stories

  you mean

  i mean that smaller sun up there is
the earth we left three months ago i
dont know who threw the bomb that
started the chain reaction or whether
it was too many bombs at once i dont
even know who won the war i guess we
did-were the only survivors

  johns gave a long sigh the immense
tragedy of it seemed to come pressing
down from the sky onto his shoulders
he felt like dante gazing into the in-
ferno-abandoned by virgil left ut-
terly alone not knowing the way out
he was the last of his kind malatesta
didnt count malatesta was an insensi-
tive ape

  he felt the tears trying to come
again and he fought to keep them back
malatesta would sneer then he thought
what the hell do i care what he thinks
why should i accept his judgment on
what is right behavior hes no more
than a half-educated hoodlum

  nevertheless he turned his face away
and bowed his head lest malatesta
should see

  what are you doing-composing an
epic poem about it said malatesta sar-
castically youre wasting your time
theres no one left to read it-except
me and im tone-deaf snap out of
it were going to live therefore we
shall want living quarters come back
to the wreck and help me

chapter ii

the curio

malatestas idea of being
helped meant that when he said
carry that outside or bring that
here johns was to do it immediately
and alone whenever johns found a
thing too heavy to lift malatesta would
grumbling and impatient take one end
of it with a vigor which made it plain
that he could have carried the whole
thing himself without effort

  but it was mainly by johns labor

  that the rough shack with its table
chairs and couches was built from suit-
able portions of the wreckage

  right said malatesta surveying it
thats good enough for now itll keep
this damned wind off anyway now
for a meal its lucky the cooks galley
wasnt too badly burnt-even though
the atomic heaters are no good the
whole system is smashed

  but the food-store and the refrig-
erator vault stood up to it theres
plenty of grub in them go get a couple
of loaves a can of beef some butter
and cheese and crackers-well find
ways of cooking some other time here
are the keys

  what about doing a bit of work
yourself johns broke in angrily do
you think im the maid-of-all-work here
ive done enough-far more than my
share you go and get the food
malatesta looked at him searching-
ly he tossed the little bunch of keys
in the air caught it on its slow descent

  right he said again if thats
the way you want it

  its only fair- began johns in a
high protesting voice but malatesta
turned on his heel and went

  he returned presently with the food
and made a pile of sandwiches on the
table he drew up the couch alongside
lay back on it comfortably and reached
for the top sandwich johns watched
him eat two then put his hand out ten-
tatively for the third

  hands off snapped malatesta no
work no eat thats how it is thats
how its going to be thats how it al-
ways was-i didnt run a soup kitchen
you know my workers had to work for
their grub

  johns stared at him then he said
with quiet acidity youre wrong with
both your facts and your analogy first-
ly i have worked-hard secondly im
not one of your employees on that
ship we all had equal standing half
that food is mine

  no it isnt said malatesta with his
mouth full youre wrong with your
facts we all had equal standing on the
ship-yes there were twenty-six of us
the two

that makes your share of the food one
twenty-sixth not a half the second
thing to understand is-were not on the
ship now

  thats a childish kind of sophistry
the others are dead they have no
use for food

 how do you know did you ask
them no-you just want to take it
because theyre helpless to stop you
thats all right i agree with your
philosophy and ill underwrite it i take
the food not only because theyre help-
less to stop me but because you are
also

  i see malatesta said johns de-
liberately might is right with you
eh

  youve got it son malatesta helped
himself to another sandwich thats
what i believe because its the truth
it isnt flashed johns you know
it isnt thats what you believe but
only because it suits you to
everybody believes what theyd like
to believe you only believe in a sys-
tem of equal shares for all because
youre weak-too weak to fight for
your share so you invent this thing you
call social justice to get your share for
you so that you dont starve you be-
lieve in social justice because it suits
you to ill take the survival of the
fittest-that suits me

  then i take it that you intend to
starve me to death 

  mr johns you take a very pessi-
mistic view of things the food is yours
-all of it-if you can take it from me
of course i could break your neck with
one hand-thats a risk youd have to
take or you could kill me if you could
think of a method again youd be at
a slight disadvantage i have this you
see-and you havent

he pulled an old-fashioned automat-
ic pistol from his pocket and held
it balanced on his palm

  a curio he said but lethal it was
my grandfathers he was an italian
who went over to the states to set up
business-in nineteen twenty-four it
was he ran a gang of bootleggers and

shadows	

made a pile when prohibition was re-
pealed he went into legitimate busi-
ness it became the family business i
owe much to him

  including your ideas on morality no
doubt you filthy hoodlum

  malatesta was off the couch in a
bound the pistol butt caught johns on
the bridge of his nose he went over
backward with a yelp of surprise and
pain the blood ran thickly from his
nostrils he blew and spluttered

  oh stop squawking said malates-
ta that was only a love tap i doubt
if its even broken your nose-bone re-
gard it as a warning i dont resent your
insult as such-theyre just words
what i dont like and wont have is your
acting as though youre superior to me
youre not in any way

  people learn from life my friend
not from books experience is the only
teacher-maybe you think you are
youve taught a lot of kids a lot of
nonsense in your time but youve noth-
ing to teach me you dont know any-
thing you dont even know that your
college education and nobel prize dont
qualify you as a superman-or even as
a man

  johns was holding a bloody handker-
chief to his nose his head still hurt
from the landing crash and now it hurt
in another place but the worse hurt
was to his sense of dignity he had
been caught by surprise and yelped
like-

  he had yelped like one of his own
pupils many years ago somehow he
always remembered coming up silently
that day behind young perkins who was
absorbed in a comic when he should
have been absorbed in euclid he re-
membered the joyous little spasm of
power-feeling as he twisted the boys
ear and puller his head around-to face
his master

  he had been the master then

  it wasnt nearly so good being the pu-
pil he resented it fiercely he hated
malatesta if there was a way to kill
him he would-

  no he mustnt think that that was
giving way to blind passion he was
startling stories

above that now one could never be a
master if one couldnt control his own
passions he that ruleth his spirit is
better than he that taketh a city

  detachedly he wondered if young
perkins had felt like killing him on
that far-off day

  he must control himself with this
roughneck he must feel himself su-
perior but not make a parade of it but
he must never never allow himself to
feel inferior certainly never act as one

  you want to earn a cup of coffee
asked malatesta suddenly

  johns still holding his handkerchief
to his nose nodded he would not trust
himself to say anything he might be
too sarcastic

  right take that bucket theres a
water channel about two miles off in
that direction i saw it just before the
smash bring back the bucket full and
you can have your coffee and-ill be
generous-a couple of sandwiches

  johns picked up the bucket and went
off slowly over the long thin grass his
two shadows moving ahead of him

  this first sally into unexplored mars
should have been a great moment in-
stead it presented itself as a weari-
some task it was malatestas fault of
course-his brutal materialism was
death to all poetry and wonder and
beauty he poisoned romance he be-
littled the really big things of life and
magnified the pin-pricks hed have to
be careful not to adopt his stunted
values

  damn his nose-would it never stop
bleeding his handkerchief was like a
red flag his face seemed to be little but
a throbbing proboscis he had never
been struck before in his life it seemed
to have knocked his sense of values spin-
ning

it was all wrong he should be over-
whelmed by the tragedy of the
sudden end of homo sapiens but he had
seen that coming for too long it had
happened at last that was all

  he felt a certain sense of loss but it
was for the acropolis for the uffizi gal-
leries the louvre the sistine chapel

the taj mahal-not for the lately living
people of earth the hills that shake-
speare had walked on around stratford-
on-avon the city of london redolent
with history   

  he had had no living relatives as for
the rest of his fellows he had known
few respected fewer loved none none
except his traveling companions on the
nuova vita that had been his real
world that was where he belonged
where he had found himself at last
among the elite the loss of those peo-
ple was a far greater tragedy than the
loss of earth

  the voice of one of the ite bellowed
after him what are you trying to do
-walk backwards i want that coffee
today get a move on

  johns made a noise between a groan
and a growl shut up you slimy thug 
he hissed in sick hatred but he knew
that malatesta was too far away to hear
him nevertheless he quickened hie
pace

  his handkerchief had become a sod-
den useless ball irritably he threw it
to the ground it alit on what had
seemed to be a small gray stone half-
hidden in the grass the stone came
alive with a leap and bounded off like
a rabbit giving a back kick with its rear
legs it was like an earless rabbit with
the smooth gray skin of a mouse

  he watched it until it had vanished
in the distance so there was animal
life on mars after all an irrational hope
sprang within him were there some-
where intelligent martians who could
paint and sculpt and build make music
and write think and discuss

  the great telescopes on the moon
their magnification unhampered by any
blurring atmosphere had raked the
planet for signs of intelligent life and
seen none empty deserts of red dust
yes and vast green plains but not 
town anywhere

  most of the mapped canals were there
but it seemed that the regularity of
them had been an optical illusion they
were no straighter than any river ther
was no more plan to them than to the
grand canyon so people had dropped
the two

the description canals and called them
what schiaparelli had really called
them-channels

  ahead of him now he could see the
line across the broad strip of green
that was one of these channels despite
the lift given by the lesser gravity it
seemed an age before he reached it

  there wasnt much to it then the
grass was longer and greener at its
banks and that was about all compared
with some of the other channels it was
but a thread-fifty feet across the
water was pale blue clear and cold he
could see where the soil ended and the
rock-bed began there was moss on
the rocks at the bottom and he could
have sworn that he saw one green
rock move-a crustacean surely

  the banks were just earth and rock
-without trace of any martian engi-
neering the water seemed to have worn
its own channel he tried to put the sil-
ly hope out of his head

  he drank then washed the blood
from his face his nose had stopped giv-
ing but not hurting he filled the bucket
and took a last look around the chan-
nel went waveringly from horizon to
horizon the other bank looked the
same as the one he was standing on

  the long grass waved silently in the
wind there was nothing else to see he
turned his back on it and set out for
the great ragged shape of the wreck
under the two small bright suns it was
the only prominent feature in the flat
landscape

  presently he trod on something that
rolled beneath his foot he stumbled
and spilt about a third of the water
then he picked up the object it was
a knob of rock twice the size of a mans
fist

  as he inspected it his heart began to
quicken that irrational hope returned
surely surely it had been consciously
shaped there were deep eye-sockets a
jutting nose the suggestion of a mouth
and chin a primitive attempt at a hu-
man head or a badly weather-worn but
comparatively modern one or-was it
just his own wishful thinking

  perhaps-there could have been very

shadows	

little erosion in this climate but it
looked as good as many museum pieces
he had seen he put it in his pocket and
resumed his journey

  when he got back all the sandwiches
were gone and malatesta said why the
hell didnt you fiu the bucket

  however malatesta had got some
utensils from the ship and started a fire
with splintered bookshelves johns went
and got some more bread from the food-
store

chapter iii
and one makes three

after they had finished the cof-
fee they lay back and smoked
johns got out the stone head and
looked it over closely

  whats that said malatesta lazily

  johns told him what he thought it
might be malatesta was merely amused
he gave the thing a rough examination
and tossed it back

  meteorite he said you can see
where its pitted by the friction

  but the shape

  have you ever been to the garden of
the gods near colorado springs the
place is-was-lousy with chunks of
rock that look like heads youre just
superimposing a pattern subjectively
like lowell peering at this planet from
flagstaff a century ago and making neat
little maps of the canalt or like a pa-
tient of rorschachs-the gink who
started the psychiatrists playing the
ink-blot game

  johns looked at him with surprise
malatesta then was not wholly a throw-
back to his gangster grandfather de-
spite his brutality and his deliberately
coarse and ungrammatical speech
sometime somewhere he had read
books and some of it had stuck

  i prefer to think its the work of
an intelligence said johns shortly

  naturally you believe what you
want to believe like i said you hope
somewhere youll find intelligent com-
	startling stokes

panionship-not like mine me i dont
go for poetry or anything else that aint
any good to me

  your disapproval doesnt destroy
the value of poetry said johns its
an eternal and indestructible value far
above your or my criticism the same
goes for any of the art forms-and
truth and beauty and goodness

  he breathed the last words so that
the capitals were almost visibly appar-
ent

  malatesta on the couch regarded
the glowing end of his cigarette then
he said slowly thinking it out the
sonnet form was a human invention-
and it died with humanity so did any
standards of art form whatsoever they
were pretty unstable even when they
existed-yesterdays art is todays
laugh

  most of the naked venuses of the
so-called old masters are fat unsight-
ly lumps by the two thousand and
three ad standards of feminine beau-
ty beauty is a matter of fashion noth-
ing more if mona lisa had tried to get
a job in the new york tv studios as an
actress shed have been told to go home
and find her eyebrows

  and how do you dispose of good-
ness

  just another matter of custom can-
nibalism was evil in america in poly-
nesia not so long ago your grandmoth-
ers shade would have felt horribly
slighted if you hadnt eaten her corpse
and so absorbed her good qualities

  i could give you a thousand exam-
ples of the same act being thought good
in one place and evil in another and
jou can kill people with kindness you
know as for truth-no ones answered
pilate yet

  johns stared at him im darned if
i can make you out he said one min-
ute you talk like a thick-eared mugg and
the next like a university graduate
malatesta laughed a fat laugh of self-
satisfaction ive been both and im
schizophrenic

  youre all wrong anyway we try
to superimpose patterns on material
certainly but these patterns are eter-

nal standards which we glimpse through
our imagination and try to record so
that others may see them more clearly
if the patterns are eternal why do
they change so often

  they dont its our imperfect vision
bad guesses and fumbling execution
truth is outside of us and eternal
malatesta said the pragmatists
dont think so and im a pragmatist all
thought is personal and purposive ab-
stracts are figments a judgment which
is not prompted by motives is impossi-
ble the only test of a truth is-does it
work if it doesnt its meaningless
the opinion of the majority is
against you

  what majority listen son-wake
up theres just you and me and no
one else there aint a majority my be-
lief is just as good as yours

johns was shocked into considera-
tion he looked at his feet thinking
-if there are only two people in the
world and one is a paranoiac and the
other a manic depressive what are the
tests of sanity where are the stand-
ards of rational behavior

  then he said i dont mean to be of-
fensive i have had more training in
these things my greater experience
can be regarded as the majority
malatesta gave him the bronx cheer
for old tradition

  can be regarded-by whom he
jeered only you of course im two
hundred pounds-or was on earth-to
your hundred and forty ill choose to
regard that extra sixty pounds of me
as the majority

  on the other hand im taller than
you snapped johns spitefully he knew
he was talking foolishness

  but im the better pool player said
malatesta suavely completing the re-
ductio ad absurdum

  this is nonsense cried johns an-
grily you cant just ignore history and
pretend that this is the beginning of the
world what about buddha and aris-
totle and lao-tsze and-

malatesta swung around and pointed
violently upward over the wreck at the
the two

sky what about them he flung back
see that star its just a star among
a billion other stars there may have
been saints and sinners on the others
too-and where is their wisdom now
thats finished written off

  im not pretending this is the be-
ginning of the world-it is the begin-
ning of the world as far as im con-
cerned-my world

  and in that moment as malatesta sat
rigid with his arm upflung a form
emerged slowly from the wreck both
men stared at it a martian thought
johns suddenly flushing with a new ex-
citement a martian

  malatesta let his arm fall he swore
under his breath this certainly is the
beginning of the world he said and
how johns here comes our majority
she was dazed and her white dress
was barred with black dirt and her fin-
gers were bleeding she was small bru-
nette rather plump and they didnt rec-
ognize her as first

  its the nurse said johns suddenly
recalling the face when it wasnt
smudged and tear-stained she had been
a quiet little thing keeping well in the
background and her services had not
been required during the voyage he
hadnt heard her exchange a word with
anyone and he wasnt sure of her name
though he had heard it

  while he stood there remembering
her malatesta walked out to meet her
johns cursed himself for his slowness
malatesta picked her up carried her
over the wreckage-strewn grass and laid
her on the couch

  get her a drink of water beautiful
dreamer he said

  presently they got her story in a
faint nebraskan accent it was short
she had been in the womens lavatory
when the crash came she didnt re-
member anything after that except
awakening in darkness under a load
of wreckage and fighting for hours
pulling and pushing at the stuff to get
out

  she recalled scarcely more of what
happened before that she had only the
sketchiest memory of the ship and the

shadows	

voyage she remembered there were
people just people-no names to them
she didnt remember malatesta and
johns

  i thought id gone right through
whats left of the ship said malates-
ta didnt think of the ladies room
maybe ive got loss of memory too
whats your name

  she didnt remember she knew she
came from ogallala on the south fork of
platte river and had been a nurse

  malatesta said well have to call
you something

  what about just nurse suggested
johns

  malatesta rubbed his dark bristly
jowls nope well call her madge
madge echoed johns

  short for majority wideawake do
i have to explain everything

chapter iv
rabbit on the run

the next morning johns was awak-
ened by the clang of the bucket
dropping beside him

  more water said malatesta stand-
ing over him i want breakfast

  johns got up and a shave too no
doubt he murmured

  hell no im never shaving again
from now on i make my own social con-
ventions

  ill come with you tom said
madge

  as they walked side by side over the
grass she said quietly he doesnt like
you does he

  the feeling is mutual we havent
a thing in common by the way do
you like poetry

  i-i think so i dont know much
about it

  i could teach you if youre willing
to learn he isnt you know whether
art lives or dies depends wholly on you
huh

  art it the communication of feel-
ings ideas standards i am an artist in
	startling stories

a vacuum-with no one to communicate
to actually an artist cant exist with-
out an audience no one ever writes or
paints for himself alone those that pre-
tend to were thinking of posterity its
possible that well have no posterity
will you be my audience madge

  she smiled for the first time she
had nice teeth sure ill try to be ap-
preciative

  thanks a lot

  all the way to the channel and back
he expressed himself to her-his moods
his ideas his fancies he didnt give her
much chance to talk

  as he was explaining to her his own
theory of what picasso had been get-
ting at she exclaimed suddenly ooh
whats that she pointed to a moving
object in the grass

  he broke off rather irritated by her
branching attention hed thought she
was absorbing the whole of it

  oh that he said theres plenty
of em about i call em martian rab-
bits

  wonder if theyre good to eat
one day well have to find out that
food-store isnt going to last forever
perhaps well finish up eating grass
like nebuchadnezzar

  neb-whos he

  a bit wearily he explained

  three more days passed and nothing
much happened except that the wind
died down and became almost impercep-
tible and the heat of the two suns could
be more strongly felt malatesta seemed
content to lounge sleep smoke and be
sarcastic at johns expense his one
other diversion was madge what irked
johns was that madge didnt seem to
mind in fact it was becoming plain
that she preferred malatestas company
to his

  on the fourth morning the split be-
came apparent

  get the water said malatesta so
tersely and contemptuously that johns
grabbed the bucket with the wild idea of
swinging it at that bristling contemptu-
ous face but an anticipatory pain in the
nose caused him to throttle the inten-
tion

  instead he gripped the bucket firmly
and said isnt it about time we moved
to the channel-side then wed have
water on tap anyway this is an un-
healthy spot that ships beginning to
smell

  i dont mind the smell said mala-
testa and all the water i need is
brought to me i like it here theres a
convenient larder with a lock on the
door theres nothing like that along
by the channel

  there may be all sorts of things bet-
ter than that if we look around weve
never tried to explore any of this plan-
et weve scarcely moved from the ship
ill think about it when i have to
said malatesta not before

  youre some organizer said johns
bitterly you havent done a thing
youre some writer you havent
written a line

  whats the use cried johns
theres no one left to appreciate it
exactly why bother we all do
it to cut a figure dont we and if
theres no one to applaud us   mala-
testa shrugged

  you dont claim you were an artist

malatesta regarded johns with
a queer look that combined de-
rision and defense

  in a way yes a better way than
yours at that art is only expression
you express yourself merely in words i
in action try my way you may get to
like it begin now-go and get that
water

  to hell with the water exploded
johns and flung the bucket away vio-
lently it landed bounced slowly and
rolled across the grass to where madge
sat she got up and walked across to the
two men

  dont hit him jack she said

  im not going to said malatesta
its impossible to teach this guy he
thinks he knows it all i could see it
would come to this heres your march-
ing orders mr know-all clear off
fend for yourself im tired of keeping
you you dont belong in my world
you contribute nothing but belly-aching
the two

scram out of here and dont come back
johns went a little pale and com-
pressed his lips i was going anyway
i cant stomach this emperor and slave
routine any more youre mad and
youre best left alone come on madge
well go start our own world

  madge said im staying with jack
what said johns and looked ap-
palled why for heavens sake hell
only make a slave out of you hes im-
possible to live with is it because hes
got the food you dont have to worry
about that theres plenty of rabbits
for us and shellfish and water we might
find edible vegetation somewhere

  it isnt that cut in madge irrita-
bly im staying with jack because i
prefer to hes got the right ideas and
hes a man

  malatesta grinned suddenly and put
his arm about her waist johns felt a
queer sharp pain it was loneliness stab-
bing at him it was as if he had been
shut out of life alone unwanted

  but- he said weakly but i
thought madge you understood

  you bore me sick she said yat-
ter-yatter-yatter all the time about
things that dont matter any more your
feet dont touch the ground anywhere

i want a family i want kids and a man
who knows how to bring em up can
you imagine what itd be like for me
withyou doing things your way

  id be doing all the mans work
while youd be sitting with the kids
pumping em full of poetry and high-
falutin useless stuff teaching em
everything but how to look after them-
selves thats the only important thing
in this world-how to look after your-
self theres no college here to feed
you just for lecturing

  the majority you see johns is on
my side said malatesta his grin
broadening

  all at once johns hated them both
with impotent fury he turned away
and walked toward the bucket

  malatestas grin vanished leave
the bucket he snapped thats my
property leave everything except your-
self

shadows	

  johns bent and picked up the stone
shaped like a head

  i trust you will allow me to take
this he said with gritty mock-polite-
ness

  sure start a museum with it now
git

  without a backward glance johns
went the world was against him it
seemed idiotic to think of one man and
one woman as the world but factually
it was very nearly true

  he had a mad impulse to smash things
and there was nothing to smash except
the weak bending grass-stalks then a
rabbit crossed his path and instant-
ly he smashed the stone down on top of
it and broke the creatures back

  with that killing the violence ebbed
from his system left him feeling weak
and empty he stared down at the
broken mouse-skinned body it looked
pitifully small and lonely

  unconsciously he identified it with
himself and regretted his unplanned ac-
tion he might have caught the crea-
ture tamed it made a friend of it if
anyone ever needed a friend he did

  he picked up the stone thoughtfully
and walked on presently he stopped
went back and picked up the rabbit
perhaps a fellow couldnt help relaps-
ing to childhood sometimes and feeling
a need for pets and dolls to confide ms
troubles to all the same he had to
eat he was on his own now he must
learn to be self-reliant

  he strode on frowning the stone in
one hand and the rabbit in the other
what was it emerson had said about
self-reliance

  after a time he forgot emerson and
by practise became expert in using the
head as a throwing stone he could hit
a rabbit on the run at ten paces

        chapter v
        the bonfire

a fortnight later johns floated
on his back in the channel gaz-
ing up into the dark blue sky at the two
	startling stories

small suns and the faint stars the air
was still the blue water placid it was
quiet and nothing disturbed the peace
or threatened to

  and he felt like screaming

  sometimes in the turmoil of earth he
had dreamed of life on a desert island
once he had seriously thought of going
into a monastery

  utter fool lie said aloud one thing
he had learned-he was not by tempera-
ment a hermit but then robinson cru-
soe had had his man friday his parrot
his goat and the monks had fellow
monks-and books

  how he longed for books even so
they were only a substitute for the spok-
en word oh for someone to speak to-
even malatesta the man was not un-
intelligent although he was a brute if
he johns had kept his temper they
might have got along after a fashion

  madge he still thought of with bitter-
ness she had not even troubled to argue
with him she had listened to him in
silence thinking only of him as a fool
it still hurt but why should he consid-
er her opinion worth anything she was
the fool not he

  if only she had not at first seemed so
pleasant and if only she werent so
pretty   

  why should she keep drifting into his
minds eye why should he bother to
waste another thought on her she was
perfectly matched with malatesta a
pair of pragmatists they could no
doubt raise a family of pragmatists
all of them unaware of the eternal
truths because there was no poet to
instruct them a tribe without poetry

  he floated with the water dulling his
ears quoting aloud the caliph in has-
san  ah if there shall ever arise a na-
tion whose people have forgotten poetry
   though their city be greater than
babylon of old though they mine a
league into earth or mount to the stars
on wings-what of them

  what had hassan answered  they
will be a dark patch upon the world 

  he tried to recall more of it and was
impatient because he could not he
stared up at earth thinking of all the

literature that had perished

  pater had advised the world to burn
with a hard gemlikeflame now it was
doing it-literally in earths dark his-
tory there had been many a burning
of the books this the last could nev-
er be surpassed it was a funeral pyre
and no phoenix would arise from the
ashes

  not unless he did something about it

  the gloom that sat heavily upon him
seemed to form itself into as heavy a
cloak of responsibility a garment he
had tried to ignore had tried to pre-
tend was something else

  there had been a good library in
the nuova vita much technical stuff
but also a fine selection of literature
intended for preservation how much of
it had been destroyed in the smash it
was his duty to preserve what was left

  probably it was the last remnant of
culture in the solar system so far as
he could judge from a fortnights trudg-
ing up and down the channel-side peer-
ing at the distances there was no sign
of any martian civilization old or new
perhaps there had never been one

  he had spent hours examining the
stone head and was still undecided about
it perhaps malatesta had been right
-perhaps he was reading a pattern into
the chance work of nature merely be-
cause he wanted to see that pattern on
the other hand he might be just as right
himself

  surely here on mars the eternal val-
ues reigned and had been glimpsed by
some sentient indigenous creatures
this carven head was a sign a symbol
a reassurance of that sometimes he was
sure of it and glowed with excitement
at those times life would flood with
meaning again

  and then at others the stone became
a lifeless lump in his hands drained
ofsignificance just a gray-black meteor-
ite then everything including him-
self was purposeless and of no more
account than the dead stone

  no the only chance was the books he
must get them

  spurred by the resolution he swam
to the bank
the two

everything looked much as be-
fore around the wreck except that
at a little distance from the shack a
large bright fire burned sending up a
wavering column of black smoke as he
neared it he could see malatesta sitting
on his couch by the fire there was a
heap on the ground at his side and oc-
casionally malatesta reached out took
something from the heap threw it into
the fire

  johns looked around hopefully for
the small plump figure of madge she
was nowhere in sight

  when he was close enough to see just
what malatesta was doing he gave
something between a shriek and a shout
and ran toward the fire

  stop that he yelled stop it i
say

  malatesta looked up at him calmly
thought i told you to stay away from
here

  dont put any more of those books
on the fire i warn you said johns
breathlessly

  youre a bit late weve had the
fire going for over a week

  you vandal johns dropped his
throwing stone and knelt by the fire
it was all burning books a tangle of
charring gilt edges leather bindings
printed rice paper

  he raked out one that had not prop-
erly caught and burned his fingers slap-
ping at the smoldering spine he
dropped the book it fell open at a page
that began complacently we can i be-
lieve take it for granted that in the
world of  which we are trying to
foresee with our imagination the pres-
ent ideological conflicts will have re-
solved themselves and mankind will
have united under a common liberal
education   

  in a spasm of bitter disgust he
thrust the book back into the flames

  make up your mind said malates-
ta sarcastically

  johns glared at him there is no
need for this sort of thing the grass
provides endless fuel youve only got to
pull it up and let it dry as ive done

  ah but you didnt have any books

shadows	

they burn longer than grass and give
more heat i prefer warmth to idealism
youll have to make do with grass
in future i want those books

  malatesta looked him up and down
apprisingly

  your fortnight in the wilderness
seems to have toughened you up never-
theless i could still beat you up with one
hand so quit talking that way

  it wont always be like this said
johns between his teeth youre too
fond of that couch youre running to
fat and self-indulgence im getting
stronger

  come back when you think youre
strong enough said malatesta with
steel in his voice ill be ready for you
so will my sons-therell be a lot of
em and theyll be tough-because i
know how to bring em up

 brought up on your philosophy
theyll be a generation of vipers
malatesta clenched his fist hard in
the same instant johns grabbed his
throwing stone and stood up they re-
garded each other frozen tense then
slowly malatesta let his hand open
you still dont like my ideas huh
theyre the quintessence of evil you
could build nothing from them but a
soulless hell

  malatesta gave a short hard laugh
thats funny ive always regarded
you as the serpent in this particular
garden of eden

  your mistake youre the serpent in
these parts

  as i recall it said malatesta the
serpent made eve eat of the forbidden
tree of knowledge of good and evil
thats exactly what you tried to do with
madge havent you discovered yet that
knowledge and happiness are incompati-
ble i thought you knew your greek
philosophy id rather be a happy pig
than an unhappy socrates if were
ignorant madge and me were happy
in our ignorance you and your truth
he spat and there was a confirmatory
hiss from the fire

  he went on why must your sort al-
ways interfere always preach think-
ing you know it all and that everyone
	startling stories

else has got to think the same as you
it was fanatics like you who brought
our world to destruction were satisfied
with making our own little truths to
suit ourselves-no factory stuff

  each man to his own belief and let
the other guy alone but thats not good
enough for you youve got to pretend
that yours is the only truth and try to
stuff it down our throats intolerant
fool what a hell you would make here
if you had your way-as you made a
hell upon earth

  you idiot said johns fiercely
earth went up in flames simply be-
cause of millions of people like you
making themselves a law unto them-
selves you undermined the belief in
morals which was our only hope when
that code fell earth fell

malatesta seemed not to have
heard him he had picked up a
book from the heap and was regarding
its title

  the works of john keats he said
well well beauty is truth truth beau-
ty-that is all ye know on earth and all
ye need to know on earth but this is
mars

  he tossed the book casually into the
fire an instant later the throwing stone
crashed against his skull and killed him

  johns stood over the body fallen
from its couch not seeing it not seeing
anything but a red mist when it cleared
he was sick and the works of keats had
gone forever

  there came a cry the thud of a
dropped bucket the wash of water over
the grass then madge came running
and flung herself on the body sobbing
and crying jack jack 

  johns watched her dully for a mo-
ment then he went off a little way
and lay on the grass face downward
making a pillow of his arms his head
was whirling and he could get nothing
straight

  presently she came and stood over
him

  you murderer

  he half-turned his head and mum-
bled he- he stopped what was the

use of trying to explain to her the loss
of keats or the chain of clashes which
had led up to that last act of vandal-
ism being the immediate pull on a hair-
trigger there must have been half-a-
dozen mixed motives which he had
neither the ability nor the will to sort
out now

  he went for his gun he said it
was self-defense

  thats a lie said madge coldly he
never had his gun because i had it
ive still got it and im going to use it
turn around do you want to be shot in
the back

  slowly he turned over and sat up
madges face was pale and tear-
stained but determined and the auto-
matic that pointed down at him was
steady over her left shoulder burned
the earth-over her right the sun

  every time i went to get the water
he would give me the gun-in case i
met you and you tried anything he
didnt care about himself he could have
killed you with one hand

  i guess he told you that himself
murmured johns wearily okay go
ahead if you believe you ought to i give
up whatever you believe youre as
right as i am when i am gone you will
always be wholly and absolutely right
-until you die

  the gun began to tremble a little

  i loved him she said he was
rough but-i loved that man now
youve killed him im going to kill you
thats justice

  if you think so but thats an ab-
stract he didnt believe in of course if
you kill me thinking that i win but is
your motive really justice it might be
revenge-or anger at being deprived
of his attentions-and his children
dont give it a name just act how you
feel-that was his philosophy and yours
im not afraid what have i to live for
you killed him because you wanted
me didnt you she said

if you think so what does it mat-
ter now shoot-get it over with
oh she said suddenly and threw
the gun away and burst into tears i
dont want to be alone she sobbed
the two

and i want so to have children
he stared at her in amazement then
he got up and took hold of her swing-
ing her half-around he kissed her and
she clung to him

  dont leave me alone she cried
dont ever leave me alone

  he held her tightening his grip its
all right madge well keep together
were all that are left-anywhere

  over her shoulder he saw their unit-
ed shadows slanting across the grass
in a long v only two of them left but
between them they had four shadows

  it was odd but it was malatestas
materialistic philosophy adopted by
madge that had now saved his life
madge had let him live only because
she needed him because of the practi-
cal outcome if he had succeeded in im-
buing her with his abstract ideals he
would be as dead as malatesta

  had he been wrong would he ever
really know

  was there something symbolic in the
double shadows or was he reading pat-
terns into things again here a man
cast one shadow by the light of the sin-
ful suicidal earth another by the light
of the life-giving sun wherever you
stood you could not escape the duality

  so long as there were the two sources
you were bound to be affected by them
both you could not choose to stand only
in the light of one

  we are what we are according to
our lights he said under his breath
madge pressed herself even closer to
him

it was some time later that he discov-
ered that though malatestas skull
had been split open it had been suffi-
ciently hard to do the same to the mis-
sile which had struck it the stone head
was gaping apart showing its own
brain

  the cells of the brain were tight-
packed in the cavity-thousands of

shadows	

rolls of incredibly thin but tough metal
tape scarcely an eighth of an inch wide
he could just make out some of the lit-
tle colored pictures on them to those
who had made them they must have
been great banners blazoning forth the
history and knowledge of their race

  think of it madge he said excit-
edly of all the incredible luck to
stumble like this on the records they
preserved for posterity it was a head-
humanoid too i wonder where the body
is we must look for it

  there may be lots of em around
she said our people were always do-
ing that sort of thing werent they 
whod have thought the martians
were such tiny folk he said there
was i carrying this in my hand scan-
ning the horizons for man-sized relics
there must be plenty of traces but
well have to look under the grass not
over it

  uh-huh she said more concerned
with the fire which was dying down
just as the rabbit-stew was nearing the
boil she reached for a book and gave it
to him to censor

  he glanced at it absently

  lord no not that one well need
it when we get down to work making
our instruments

  he laid microscopy and optical sys-
tems on the grass beside him

  she handed him another he looked
at it and smiled well need that too
he laid obstetrics on top of the other
book

  patiently she held up another for his
inspection

  birr he said burn that

  she poked income tax accountancy
carefully under the pot and the flames
gathered life she peeped into the pot
and was satisfied with what she saw
the stew was thickening nicely and they
would have a rich supper it seemed
just about the most important thing in
life to her at that moment

  the cabin was quiet betty welstead
sat watching her husband at the assay
table her emotions tuned to his when
the centrifuge scale indicated heavy
metal and welstead leaned forward she
leaned forward too in unconscious sym-

men of the ten books	

pathy when he burnt scrapings in the
spectroscope and read lead from the
brightest pattern and chewed at his lips
betty released her pent-up breath fell
back in her seat

  ralph welstead stood up a man of
medium height-rugged tough-looking
-with hair and skin and eyes the same
tawny color he brushed the whole clut-
ter of rock and ore into the waste chute
and betty followed him with her eyes

  welstead said sourly wed be mil-
lionaires if that asteroid had been inside
the solar system out here unless its
pure platinum or uranium its not worth
mining

  betty broached a subject which for
two months had been on the top of her
mind perhaps we should start to swing
back in

  welstead frowned stepped up into the
observation dome betty watched after
him anxiously she understood very well
that the instinct of the explorer as much
as the quest for minerals had brought
them out so far

  welstead stepped back down into the
cabin theres a star ahead-he put a
finger into the three-dimensional chart
-this one right here eridanus two
thousand nine hundred and thirty-two
lets make a quick check-and then
well head back in

  betty nodded suddenly happy suits
me she jumped up and together they
went to the screen he aimed the catch-
all vortex dialed the hurrying blur to
stability and the star pulsed out like a
white-hot coin a single planet made up
the entourage

  looks about earth-size said wel-
tead interest in his voice and bettys
heart sank a trifle he tuned the circuit
finer turned ifp the magnification and
the planet leapt at them

  look at that atmosphere thick

  he swiveled across the jointed arm
holding the thermocouple and together
they bent over the dial

  n i n e t e e n degrees centigrade
about earth-norm lets look at that
atmosphere you know dear we might
have something tremendous here
earth-size earth temperature  his

voice fell off in a mutter as he peered
through the spectroscope flipping screen
after screen past the pattern from the
planet he stood up cast betty a swift
exultant glance then squinted in sudden
reflection better make sure before we
get too excited

  betty felt no excitement she watched
without words as welstead thumbed
through the catalogue

  whee yelled welstead suddenly a
small boy no listing its ours and
bettys heart melted at the news delay
months of delay while welstead ex-
plored the planet charted its oceans and
continents classified its life at the same
time a spark of her husbands enthusi-
asm caught fire in her brain and interest
began to edge aside her gloom

  well name it welstead  he said
or no-elizabeth for you a planet of
your own some day therell be cities
and millions of people and every time
they write a letter or throw a shovelful
of dirt or a ship lands-theyll use your
name

  no dear she said dont be ridic-
ulous well call it welstead-for us
both

  they felt an involuntary pang of dis-
appointment later on when they found
the planet already inhabited and by
men

vet their reception astonished them
as much as the basic discovery of
the planet and its people curiosity hos-
tility might have been expected   

  they had been in no hurry to land
preferring to fall into an orbit just
above the atmosphere the better to
study the planet and its inhabitants

  it looked to be a cheerful world there
were a thousand kinds of forest jungle
savannah sunny rivers coursed green
fields a thousand lakes and three oceans
glowed blue to the far north and far
south snowfields glittered dazzled such
cities as they found-the world seemed
sparsely settled-merged indistinguish-
ably with the countryside

  they were wide low cities very dif-
ferent from the clanging hives of earth
and lay under the greenery like carv-
	startling stories

ings in alabaster or miraculous snow-
flakes betty in whose nature ran a
strong streak of the romantic was en-
tranced

  they look like cities of paradise-
cities in a dream

  welstead said reflectively theyre
evidently not backward see that cluster
of long gray buildings off to the side
those are factories

  betty voiced a doubt which had been
gradually forming into words do you
think they might-resent our landing
if theyve gone to the trouble of creat-
ing a secret-well call it utopia-they
light not want to be discovered
welstead turned his head gazed at
her eye to eye do you want to land
he asked soberly

  why yes-if you do if you dont
think its dangerous

  i dont know whether its dangerous
or not a people as enlightened as those
cities would seem to indicate would hard-
ly maltreat strangers

  betty searched the face of the planet
i think it would be safe

  welstead laughed im game weve
got to die sometime why not out here
he jumped up to the controls nosed
the ship down

  well land right in their laps right
in the middle of that big city down
there

  betty looked at him questioningly
no sense sneaking down out in the
wilds said welstead if were land-
ing well land with a flourish

  and if they shoot us for our inso-
lence

  call it fate

  they bellied down into a park in the
very center of the city from the obser-
vation dome welstead glimpsed hurry-
ing knots of people

  go to the port betty open it just a
crack and show yourself ill stay at the
controls one false move one dead cat
heaved at us and well be back in space
so fast they wont remember we ar-
rived

  thousands of men and women of all
ages had surrounded the ship all shout-
ing all agitated by strong emotion

  they re throwing flowers betty
gasped she opened the port and stood
in the doorway and the people below
shouted chanted wept feeling rather
ridiculous betty waved smiled

  she turned to look back up at wel-
stead i dont know what weve done to
deserve all this but were heroes maybe
they think were somebody else
welstead craned his neck through the
observation dome they look healthy-
normal

  theyre beautiful said betty all
of them

  the throng opened a small group of
elderly men and women approached the
leader a white-haired man tall lean
with much the same face as michel-
angelos jehovah stood forth

  welcome he called resonantly
welcome from the people of haven

betty stared and welstead clam-
bered down from the controls the
words were strangely pronounced the
grammar was archaic-but it was the
language of earth

  the white-haired man spoke on with-
out calculation as if delivering a speech
of great familiarity we have waited
two hundred and seventy-one years for
your coming for the deliverance you
will bring us

  deliverance welstead considered the
word dont see much to deliver em
from he muttered aside to betty the
suns shining theres flowers on all the
trees they look well-fed-a lot more en-
thusiastic than i do deliver em from
what

  betty was climbing down to the
ground and welstead followed

  thanks for the welcome said wel-
stead trying not to sound like a visiting
politician were glad to be here its
a wonderful experience coming unex-
pectedly on a world like this

  the white-haired man bowed gravely
naturally you must be curious-as
curious as we are about the civilized uni-
verse but for the present just one ques-
tion for the ears of our world how goes
it with earth

  welstead rubbed his chin acutely con-
men of the ten books	

scious of the thousands of eyes the utter
silence

  earth he said goes about as usu-
al theres the same seasons the same
rain sunshine frost and wind and the
people of haven breathed in his words
as devoutly as if they were the purest
poetry earth is still the center of the
cluster and theres more people living
on earth than ever before more noise
more nuisance  

  wars new governments how far
does science reach 

  welstead considered wars none to
speak of-not since the hieratic league
broke up the government still governs
uses lots of statistical machinery
theres still graft robbery inefficiency
if thats what you mean

  science-thats a big subject we
know a lot but we dont know a lot more
the way its always been everything
considered its the same earth its al-
ways been-some good a lot of bad

  he paused and the pent breath of
the listeners went in a great sigh the
white-haired man nodded again serious
sober-though evidently infected with
the excitement that fired his fellows

  no more for the present youll be
tired and theres much time for talk
may i offer you the hospitality of my
house

  welstead looked uncertainly at betty
instinct urged him not to leave his ship

  or if youd prefer to remain aboard
   suggested the man of haven

  no said welstead well be de-
lighted if harm were intended-as em-
phatically did not seem likely-their
presence aboard the ship would not pre-
vent it he craned his neck looked here
and there for the officialdom that would
be bumptiously present on earth

  is there anyone we should report to
any law well be breaking by parking
our ship here

  the white-haired man laughed what
a question i am alexander clay mayor
of this city mytilene and guide of
haven by my authority and by common
will you are free of anything the planet
can offer you your ship will not be
molested

  he led them to a wide low car and
betty was uncomfortably conscious of
her blue shorts rumpled and untidy by
comparison with the many-colored
tunics of the women in the crowd

  welstead was interested in the car
as providing a gauge of havens tech-
nics built of shiny gray metal it hung
a foot above the ground without the in-
tervention of wheels he gave clay a
startled look anti-gravity your for-
tunes made

  clay shook his head indulgently
magnetic fields antipathetic to the
metal in the road is it not a common-
place on earth

  no said welstead the theory of
course is well-known but there is too
much opposition too many roads to dig
up we still use wheels

  clay said reflectively the force of
tradition the continuity which gener-
ates the culture of races the stream we
have been so long lost from 
welstead shot him a sidelong glance
clay was entirely serious

the car had been sliding down the
road at rather high speed through
vistas of wonderful quiet and beauty
every direction showed a new and sepa-
rate enchantment-a glade surrounded
by great trees a small home of natural
wood a cluster of public buildings
around a plaza a terrace checkered with
trees and lined with many-colored shops

  occasionally there were touches of
drama such as the pylon at the end of
a wide avenue it rose two hundred feet
into the air a structure of concrete
bronze and black metal and it bore the
heroic figure of a man grasping vainly
for a star

  welstead craned his neck like a tour-
ist magnificent

  clay assented without enthusiasm i
suppose its not discreditable of course
to you fresh from the worlds of civiliza-
tion- he left the sentence unfinished
excuse me while i call my home he
bent his head to a telephone

  betty said in welsteads ear this is
a city every planner on earth would sell
his soul to build
	startling stories

  welstead grunted remember hal-
leck he muttered he was a city plan-
ner he wanted to tear down a square
mile of slums in lanchester eighteen
stories high on the average nothing but
airless three-room apartments

   first the real estate lobby tore into
him called him a chaoticist a rumor
circulated among his friends that he was
morally degenerate the poor devils that
lived there tried to lynch him because
theyd be evicted the old faithfuls read
him out of the party because they pulled
the votes of the district the slums are
stilt there and hallecks selling farm im-
plements on arcturus five

  betty looked off through the trees
maybe haven will turn out to be an
object lesson for the rest of the cluster
welstead shrugged maybe maybe
not peace and seclusion are not some-
thing you can show to a million people
-because it isnt peace and seclusion
any more

  betty sat up straighter in her seat
the only way to convince the unbe-
lievers is by showing them setting them
an example do you think that if the
lanchester slum-dwellers saw this city
theyd go back to their three-room apart-
ments without wanting to do something
about it

   if they saw this city said welstead
theyd never leave haven by hook or
crook stowaway or workaway theyd
emigrate

  include me in the first wave said
betty indignantly

  the car turned into a leafy tunnel
crossed a carpet of bright green turf
stopped by a house built of dark mas-
sive wood four high gables in a row
overlooked a terrace where a stream
followed its natural bed the house
looked spacious comfortable-rather
like the best country villas of earth and
the garden planets without the sense of
contrived effect the strain the staging

  my home said clay he slid back a
door of waxed blond wood ushered them
into an entry carpeted with golden rat-
tan walled with a fabric the color of
the forest outside a bench of glowing
dark wood crossed a wall under a framed

painting from no apparent source light
flooded the room like water in a tank

  one moment said clay with a trace
of embarrassment my home is poor
and makeshift enough without exposing
it to your eyes at its worst he was
clearly sincere this was no convention-
al deprecation

  he started away paused and said to
his half-comprehending guests i must
apologize for our backwardness but we
have no facilities for housing notable
guests no great inns or embassies or
state-houses such as must add to the
dignity of life on earth i can only offer
you the hospitality of my home

  welstead and betty both protested
we dont deserve as much after all
were only a pair of fly-by-night pros-
pectors

  clay smiled and they could see that
he had been put more at his ease
youre the link between haven and
civilization-the most important visi-
tors weve ever had excuse me he de-
parted

  betty went to the picture on the wall
a simple landscape-the slope of a hill
a few trees a distant range of moun-
tains welstead with small artistic sen-
sibility looked around for the source of
the light-without success he joined
betty beside the picture she said half-
breathlessly this is a-im afraid to
say it-a masterpiece

  welstead squinted trying to under-
stand the basis of his wifes awe and
wonderment indeed the picture focused
his eyes drew them in and around the
frame infused him with a pleasant ex-
hilaration a warmth and serenity

clay returning noticed their inter-
est what do you think of it he asked

  i think its-exceedingly well done
said betty at a loss for words which
would convey her admiration without
sounding fulsome

  clay shook his head ruefully turned
away you need not praise an inconse-
quentiality out of courtesy mrs wel-
stead we know our deficiencies your
eyes have seen the giottos the rem-
brandts the cezannes this must seem a
poor thing
men of the

betty began to remonstrate but
halted words evidently would not
convince clay-or perhaps a convention
of his society prompted him to belittle
the works of his people and it might be
discourteous to argue too vehemently

  your quarters are being prepared
clay told them ive also ordered fresh
clothing for you both as i see yours are
stained with travel

  betty blushed smoothed the legs of
her blue shorts welstead sheepishly
brushed at his faded blouse he reached
in his pocket pulled out a bit of gravel
from an asteroid i prospected a few
weeks ago he twisted it around in his
fingers nothing but granite with gar-
net inclusions

  clay took the bit of rock inspected
it with a peculiar reverence may i keep
this

  why of course

  clay laid the bit of stone on a silver
plate you will not understand what
this small stone symbolizes to us of
haven interstellar travel-our goal
our dream for two hundred and seventy-
one years

  the recurrence of the period two hun-
dred and seventy-one years welstead
calculated that put them back into the
era of the great excursives when the
over-under space-drive had first come
into use when men drove pell-mell
through the galaxy like bees through a
field of flowers and human culture flared
through space like a super-nova

  clay led them through a large room
simple in effect rich in detail wel-
steads vision was not analytical enough
to catch every particular at first he
sensed overall tones of tan brown mel-
low blue watery green in the wood
fabric glass pottery-the colors com-
bined to marvelous effect with the waxy
umber gleam of natural wood at the
end of the room a case held ten large
books bound in black leather and these
by some indefinable emphasis seemed
to bear the significance of an icon

  they passed through a passage open
along one side into a garden filled with
flowers low trees tame birds clay
showed them into a long apartment

ten books	

streaming with sunlight

  your bath is through the door said
clay fresh clothes are laid out on the
bed when you are rested i shall be in
the main hall please be at leisure-the
house is yours

  they were alone betty sighed hap-
pily sank down on the bed isnt it
wonderful dear

  its queer said welstead standing
in the middle of the room

  whats queer

  mainly why these people apparently
gifted and efficient act so humble so
self-deprecating

  they look confident

  they are confident yet as soon as
the word earth is mentioned its like
saying alakland to an exiled lak
theres nothing like it

  betty shrugged began to remove her
clothes theres probably some very
simple explanation right now im tired
of speculating im for that bath water
water water tons of it

they found clay in the long hall
with his pleasant-faced wife his
four youngest children whom he grave-
ly introduced

  welstead and betty seated themselves
on a divan and clay poured them small
china cups of pale yellow-green wine
then settled back in his own seat

  first ill explain our world of haven
to you-or have you surmised our
plight

  welstead said i guess a colony was
planted here and forgotten-lost

  clay smiled sadly our beginnings
were rather more dramatic two hun-
dred and seventy-one years ago the pas-
senger packet etruria enroute to rigel
went out of control according to the
story handed down to us the bus-bars
fused inside the drive-box if the case
were opened the fields would collapse if
it were not the ship would fly until there
was no more energy

  welstead said that was a common
accident in the old days usually the en-
gineer cut away the thrust-blocks on
one side of the hull then the ship flew
in circles until help arrived
	startling stories

  clay made a wry sad grimace no
one on the etmiia thought of that the
ship left the known universe and finally
passed close to a plantthat seemed
capable of sustaining life the sixty-
three aboard took to the life-boats and
so landed on haven

  thirty-four men twenty-five wo-
men four children-ranging in age
from dorothy pell eight to vladimir
hocha seventy-four with representa-
tives of every human race were the
descendants of the sixty-three-three
hundred million of us

  fast work said betty with admi-
ration

  large families returned clay i
have nine children sixteen grandchil-
dren from the start our guiding princi-
ple has been to keep the culture of earth
intact for our descendants to teach them
what we knew of human tradition

  so that when rescue came-as it
must finally-then our children or our
childrens children could return to
earth not as savages but as citizens
and our invaluable source has been the
ten books the only books brought down
from the etruria we could not have
been favored with books more inspir-
ing  

  clays gaze went to the black bound
books at the end of the room and his
voice lowered a trifle

 the encyclopedia of human
achievement the original edition was
in ten little plastrol volumes none of
them larger than your hand-but in
them was such a treasury of human
glory that never could we forget our
ancestry or rest in our efforts to achieve
somewhere near the level of the great
masters all the works of the human
race we set as our standards-music
art literature-all were described in the
encyclopedia

  described you say mused wel-
stead

  there were no illustrations asked
betty

  no said clay there was small
compass for pictures in the original edi-
tion however-he went to the case
selected a volume at random-the

words left little to the imagination for
example on the music of bach-when
bach arrived on the scene the toccata
was tentative indecisive-a recreation
a tour de force where the musician
might display his virtuosity

   in bach the toccata becomes a me-
dium of the noblest plasticity the theme
he suggests by casual fingering of the
keyboard unrelated runs then comes
a glorious burst into harmony-the orig-
inal runs glow like prisms assume stat-
ure gradually topple together into a
miraculous pyramid of sound

  and on beethoven-a god among
men his music is the voice of the world
the pageant of all irftagined splendor
the sounds he invokes are natural
forces of the same order as sunsets
storms at sea the view from mountain
crags	t

  and on leon bismarck beiderbecke
-his trumpet pours out such a torrent
of ecstasy such triumph such overrid-
ing joys that the heart of man freezes
in anguish at not being wholly part of
it  clay closed the book replaced it
such is our heritage we have tried to
keep alive however poorly the stream
of our original culture

  i would say that you have succeed-
ed welstead remarked dryly

  betty sighed a long slow suspiration
clay shook his head you cant judge
until youve seen more of haven were
comfortable enough though our manner
of living must seem unimpressive in
comparison with the great cities the
magnificent palaces of earth

  no not at all said betty but clay
made a polite gesture

  dont feel obliged to flatter us as
ive said were aware of our deficien-
cies our music for instance-it is pleas-
ant sometimes exciting sometimes pro-
found but never does it reach the
heights of poignancy that the encyclo-
pedia describes

  our art is technically good but we
despair of emulating seurat who out-
lumens light or braque the patterns
of the mind in patterns of color on the
patterns of life or cezanne-the planes
which under the guise of natural objects
men of the ten books	

march merge meet in accord with re-
morseless logic which wheel around and
impel the mind to admit the absolute
justice of the composition 

  betty glanced at her husband appre-
hensive lest he speak what she knew
must be on his mind to her relief he
kept silent squinting thoughtfully at
clay for her part betty resolved to
maintain a noncommittal attitude

  no clay said heavily we do the
best we can and in some fields weve
naturally achieved more than in others
to begin with we had the benefit of all
human experience in our memories the
paths were charted out for us-we knew
the mistakes to avoid weve never had
wars or compulsion weve never per-
mitted unreined authority still weve
tried to reward those who are willing
to accept responsibility

  our criminals-very few now-are
treated for mental disorder on the first
and second offense sterilized on the
third executed on the fourth-our basic
law being cooperation and contribution
to the society though there is infinite
latitude in how this contribution shall
be made we do not make society a jug-
gernaut a man may live as integrally
or as singularly as he wishes so long
as he complies with the basic law

  clay paused looking from welstead
to betty now do you understand our
way of living

  more or less said welstead in the
outline at least you seem to have made
a great deal of progress technically

  clay considered from one aspect
yes from another no we had the life-
boat tools we had the technical skills
and most important we knew what we
were trying to do our main goal natu-
rally has been the conquest of space
weve gone up in rockets but they can
take us nowhere save around the sun
and back our scientists are close on the
secret of the space-drive but certain
practical difficulties are holding them
up

  welstead laughed space-drive can
never be discovered by rational effort
thats a philosophical question which
has been threshed back and forth for

hundreds of years reason-the abstract
idea-is a function of ordinary time and
space the space-drive has no qualities
in common with these ideas and for this
reason human thought can never con-
sciously solve the problem of the over-
drive experiment trial and error can
do it thinking about it is useless

  hm said clay thats a new con-
cept but now your presence makes it
beside the point for you will be the link
back to our homeland

  betty could see words trembling on
her husbands tongue she clenched her
hands willed-willed-willed perhaps
the effort had some effect because wel-
stead merely said well do anything
we can to help

all of mytilene they visited and
nearby tiryns dicte and ilium
they saw industrial centers atomic
power generators farms schools they
attended a session of the council of
guides both making brief speeches and
they spoke to the people of haven by
television every news organ on the
planet carried their words

  they heard music from a green hill-
side the orchestra playing from under
tremendous smoke black trees they saw
the art of haven in public galleries in
homes and in common use they read
some of the literature studied the range
of the planets science which was rough-
ly equivalent to that of earth and they
marveled continually how so few peo-
ple in so little time could accomplish so
much

  they visited the laboratories where
three hundred scientists and engineers
strove to force magnetic gravitic and
vortigial fields into the fusion that made
star-to-star flight possible and the
scientists watched in breathless tension
as welstead inspected their apparatus

  he saw at a single glance the source
of their difficulty he had read of the
same experiments on earth three hun-
dred years ago and of the fantastic acci-
dent that had led roman-forteski and
gladheim to enclose the generatrix in a
dodecahedron of quartz only by such a
freak-or by his information-would
	startling stories

these scientists of haven solve the mys-
tery of space-drive

  and welstead walked thoughtfully
from the laboratory with the disap-
pointed glances of the technicians fol-
lowing him out and betty had glanced
after him in wonder and the rest of
the day there had been a strain between
them

  that night as they lay in the darkness
rigid wakeful each could feel the pres-
sure of the others thoughts betty
finally broke the silence in a voice so
blunt that there was no mistaking her
feeling

  ralph

  what

  why did you act as you did in the
laboratory 

  careful muttered welstead may-
be the room is wired for sound

  betty laughed scornfully this isnt
earth these people are trusting hon-
est   

  it was welsteads turn to laugh-a
short cheerless laugh and thats the
reason im ignorant when it comes to
space-drive

  betty stiffened what do you mean
i mean that these people are too
damn good to ruin

  betty relaxed sighed spoke slowly
as if she knew she was in for a long
pull how-ruin

  welstead snorted its perfectly
plain youve been to their homes youve
read their poetry listened to their
music

  of course these people live every
second of their lives with-well call it
exaltation a devotion to creation like
nothing ive ever seen before

  welstead said somberly theyre liv-
ing in the grandest illusion ever im-
agined and theyre riding for an awful
fall theyre like a man on a glorious
wine drunk

  betty stared through the dark are
you crazy

  theyre living in exaltation now
said welstead but what a bump when
the bubble breaks

  but why should it break cried
betty why cant-

  betty said welstead with a cold
sardonic voice have you ever seen a
public park on earth after a holiday
betty said hotly yes-its dreadful
because the people of earth have no
feeling of community

  right said welstead and these
people have theyre knit very tightly
by a compulsion that made them achieve
in two hundred-odd years what took
seven thousand on earth theyre all
facing in the same direction geared to
the same drive once that drive is gone
how do you expect theyll hold on to their
standards

  betty was silent

 human beings said welstead
dreamily are at their best when the
goings toughest theyre either at their
best or else theyre nothing the goings
been tough here-these people have
come through give them a cheap liv-
ing tourist money-then what

  but thats not all in fact its only
half the story these people here he
stated with emphasis are living in a
dream theyre the victims of the ten
books they take every word literally
and theyve worked their hearts out try-
ing to come somewhere near what they
expect the standards to be

  their own stuff doesnt do half the
things to them that the ten books says
good art ought to do whoever wrote
those ten books must have been a copy-
writer for an advertising agency wel-
stead laughed shakespeare wrote good
plays-sure i concede it but ive never
seen fires flickering along the words
gusty winds rushing through the pages
sibelius i suppose was a great com-
poser-im no expert on these things-
but whoever listened and became part
of finlands ice moss-smelling earth
hoarse-breathing forest the way the
ten books said everyone did

betty said he was merely trying
to express vividly the essence of
the artists and musicians

  nothing wrong in that said wel-
stead on earth were conditioned to
call everything in print a lie at least we
allow for several hundred percent over-
men of the ten books	

statement these people out here arent
immunized theyve taken every word
at its face value the ten books is their
bible theyre trying to equal accom-
plishments which never existed

  betty raised herself up on an elbow
said in a voice of hushed triumph and
theyve succeeded ralph theyve suc-
ceeded theyve met the challenge
theyve equaled or beaten anything
earth has ever produced ralph im
proud to belong to the same race
same species welstead corrected
dryly these people are a mixed race
theyre all races

  whats the difference betty
snapped youre just quibbling you
know what i mean well enough
were on a sidetrack said welstead
wearily the question is not the people
of haven and their accomplishments
of course theyre wonderful-now but
how do you think contact with earth
will affect them

  do you think theyll continue produc-
ing when the challenge is gone when
they find the earth is a rookery-nag-
gingquarreling-full of mediocre hacks
and cheap mischief where the artists
draw nothing but nude women and the
musicians make their living reeling out
sound sound sound-any kind of sound
-for television sound-track where are
all their dreams then

  talk about disappointment stale-
ness mark my words half the popula-
tion would be suicides and the other half
would turn to prostitution and cheating
the tourists its a tough proposition i
say leave them with their dreams let
them think were the worst sort of vil-
lains i say get off the planet get back
where we belong

betty said in a troubled voice sooner
or later somebody else will find them
maybe-maybe not well report the
region barren-which it is except for
haven

  betty said in a small voice ralph i
couldnt do it i couldnt violate their
trust

not even to keep them trusting
betty said wildly dont you think
thered be an equal deflation if we

sneaked away and left them were the
climax to their entire two hundred and
seventy-one years think of the listless-
ness after we left

  theyre working on their space-
drive said welstead chances are a
million to one against their stumbling
on it they dont know that theyve got
a flicker of a field and they think all they
have to do is adjust the power feed get
better insulation they dont have the
mardi gras lamp that gladheim
snatched up when the lead tank melted
ralph said betty your words are
all very logical your arguments stay
together--but theyre not satisfying
emotionally i dont have the feeling of
rightness

  pish said welstead lets not go
spiritual

  and said betty softly lets not try
to play god either

  there was a long silence

  ralph said betty

  what

  isnt there some way   

  some way to do what

  why should it be our responsibility 
i dont know whose else it is were
the instruments-

  but its their lives

  betty said welstead wearily
heres one time we cant pass the buck
were the people who in the last resort
say yes or no were the only people that
see on both sides of the fence its an
awful decision to make-but i say no
there was no more talking and after
an unmeasured period they fell asleep

three nights later welstead
stopped betty as she began to un-
dress for bed she gave him a dark wide-
eyed stare

  throw whatever youre taking into a
bag were leaving

  bettys body was rigid and tense
slowly relaxing as she took a step to-
ward him ralph  

  what and she could find no soft-
ness no indecision in his topaz eyes

  ralph-its dangerous for us to go
if they caught us theyd execute us-
for utter depravity and she said in a
	startling stories

murmur looking away i suppose
theyd be justified too

  its a chance well have to take just
what we said the day we decided to land
weve got to die sometime get your
gear and lets take off

  we should leave a note ralph some-
thing   

  he pointed to an envelope there
it is thanking them for their hospital-
ity i told them we were criminals and
couldnt risk returning to earth its
thin but its the best i could do

a hint of fire returned to bettys
voice dont worry theyll believe it
sullenly she tucked a few trinkets
into a pouch its a long way to the
ship you know she warned him

  well take clays car ive watched
him and i know how to drive it

  she jerked in  small bitter spasm of
laughter were even car thieves

  got to be said welstead stonily he
went to the door listened the utter si-
lence of honest sleep held the rest of the
house he returned to where betty stood
waiting watching him coldly with an
air of dissociation

  this way said welstead out
through the terrace

  they passed out into the moonless
night of haven and the only sound was
the glassy tinkle of the little stream that
ran in its natural bed through the ter-
race

  welstead took bettys hand easy
now dont walk into that bamboo he
clutched and they froze to a halt
through a window had come a sound-
a gasp-and then the relieved mutter a
person makes on waking from a bad
dream

  slowly like glass melting under heat
the two came to life stole across the
terrace out upon the turf beside the
house they circled the vegetable gar-
den and the loom of the car bulked be-
fore them

  get in whispered welstead ill
push till were down around the bend
betty climbed into the seat and her
foot scraped against the metal wel-
stead stiffened listened pierced the
darkness like an eagle quiet from the

house the quiet of relaxation of trust
 he pushed at the car and it floated
easily across the ground resisting his
hand only through inertia

  it jerked to a sudden halt and wel-
stead froze in his tracks again a bur-
glar alarm of some sort no there were
no thieves on haven-except two re-
cently-landed people from earth a
trap

  the anchor whispered betty

  of course-welstead almost groaned
with relief every car had an anchor tc
prevent the wind from blowing it away
he found it hooked it into place on the
cars frame and now the car floated
without hindrance down the leafy tun-
nel that was clays driveway around
a bend he ran to the door jumped in
pressed his foot on the power pedal and
the car slid away with the easy grace of
a canoe out on the main road he
switched on the lights and they rushed
off through the night

  and we still use wheels on earth
said welstead if we only had a tenth
of the guts these people have-

  cars passed them from the other di-
rection the lights glowed briefly into
their faces and they cringed low behind
the windscreen

  they came to the park where their
ship lay if anyone stops us welstead
said in bettys ear weve just driven
down to get some personal effects after
all were not prisoners

  but he circled the ship warily before
stopping beside it and then he waited a
few seconds straining his eyes through
the darkness but there was no sound
no light no sign of any guard or human
presence

  welstead jumped from the car fast
now run over climb inside ill be right
behind you

  they dashed through the dark up
the rungs welded to the hull and the cold
steel felt like a caress to welsteads hot
hands into the cabin he thudded the
port shut slammed home the dogs

  welstead vaulted to the controls pow-
ered the reactors dangerous business-
but once clear of the atmosphere they
could take time to let them warm prop-
erly the ship rose the darkness and
lights of mytilene fell below welstead
sighed suddenly tired but warm and
relaxed

  up up-and the planet became a ball
and eridanus two thousand nine hun-
dred and thirty-two peered around the
edge and suddenly without any notice-
able sense of boundary passed they were
out in space

  welstead sighed lord what a relief
i never knew how good empty space
could look

  it looks beautiful to me also said
alexander clay ive never seen it be-
fore

  welstead whirled jumped to his feet

clay came forward from the reac-
tion chamber watching with a pe-
culiar expression welstead took to be
deadly fury betty stood by the bulkhead
looking from one to the other her face
blank as a mirror

  welstead came slowly down from the
controls well-youve caught us in
the act i suppose you think were treat-
ing you pretty rough maybe we are
but my conscience is clear and were
not going back looks like you asked for
a ride and youre going to get one if
necessary- he paused meaningfully

  then howd you get aboard and
after an instant of narrow-eyed specula-
tion and why  why tonight

  clay shook his head slowly ralph-
you dont give us any credit for ordinary
intelligence let alone ordinary courage
what do you mean

  i mean that i understand your mo-
tives-and i admire you for them al-
though i think youve been bull-headed
putting them into action without dis-
cussing it with the people most directly
concerned

  welstead lowered his head stared
with hard eyes its basically my re-
sponsibility i dont like it but im not
afraid of it

  it does you credit said clay mildly
on haven were used to sharing re-
sponsibility not diluting it you under-

how to buy
    better work clothes

  rugged sewing that go into blue bell work

stand but putting a dozen-a hundred
-a thousand minds on a problem that
might be too much for one you dont
appreciate us ralph you think were

 no said welstead not exactly-
our civilization is built on adaptabil-
ity on growth on flexibility continued
clay we-

  you dont understand just what
youd have to adapt to said welstead
harshly its nothing nice its graft
scheming sharp-shooters tourists by the
million wholl leave your planet the way
a platoon of invading soldiers leaves the
first pretty girl they find

  therell be problems said clay his
voice took on power but thats what
we want ralph-problems were hun-
gry for them for the problems of ordi-
nary human existence we want to get
back into the stream of life and if it
means grunting and sweating we want
it were flesh and blood just like you
are

  we dont want nirvana-we want to
test our strength we want to fight along
with the rest of decent humanity dont
you fight what you think is unjust
welstead slowly shook his head not
any more its too big for me i tried
when i was young then i gave up may-
be thats why betty and i roam around
the outer edges

  no said betty thats not it at all
ralph and you know it you explore
because you like exploring you like the
rough and tumble of human contact just
as much as anyone else

  rough and tumble said clay savor-
ing the words thats what we need on
haven they had it in the old days they
gave themselves to it beating the new
world into submission its ours now
another hundred years of nowhere to
go and wed be drugged lethargic deca-
dent

  welstead was silent

  the thing to remember ralph said

clay is that were part of humanity
if theres good going fine but if there
are problems we want to help lick them
you said youd given up because it was
too big for you do you think it would be
too big for a whole planet three hun-
dred million hard honest brains
welstead stared his imagination kin-
dled i dont see how-

  clay smiled i dont either its a
problem for three hundred million
minds thinking about it that way it
doesnt seem so big if it takes three
hundred brains three days to figure out a
dodecahedron of quartz-

  welstead jerked looked accusingly at
his wife betty

  she shook her head ralph i told
clay about our conversation our argu-
ment we discussed it all around ralph
and i told him everything-and i told
him id give a signal whenever we start-
ed to leave but i never mentioned space-
drive if they discovered it they did it
by themselves

  welstead turned slowly back to clay
discovered it but-thats impossi-
ble

  said clay nothings impossible
you yourself gave me the hint when
you told me human reason was useless
because the space-drive worked out of
a different environment so we concen-
trated not on the drive itself but on the
environment the first results came at
us in terms of twelve directions-hence
the dodecahedron just a hunch an ex-
periment and it worked

  welstead sighed im licked i give
in clay the headache is yours youve
made it yours what do you want to do
go back to haven 

  clay smiled almost with affection
were this far id like to see earth
for a month incognito then well come
back to haven and make a report to the
world and then theres three hundred
million of us waiting for the bell in
round one

short order

by sam merwin jr

   enoch jones the wanderer had been about everywhere there
   was to go-but he had traveled always in the same spot

it was time to close up the dog-
wagon for the night the hands of
the dirty-faced clock on the wall yawned
widely at five minutes of four a cock-
roach moved slowly tiredly toward its
nocturnal crack at the base of the wall
molly the stubby thick-bodied waitress
had already hung up her apron and de-
parted for home-or wherever she

elected to unveil her sawed-off-shotgun
charms

  enoch jones the leathery bald-headed
short-order cook cleaned with profes-
sional care the long thin-bladed knife
that was the chief instrument of his
sandwich-cutting trade he placed it
carefully in its rack-slot above the back-
bar then turned to regard with mel-


	startling stories

ancholy disinterest the two burly blue-
chinned diesel truckmen who were the
sole remaining customers

  closing up he told them his hands
unfastening with the expertness of long
practise the strings of his own white
apron

  okay pop said one of them his
voice too bore the fuzz of bone-deep
fatigue just as soon as i get this
java down

  enoch jones nodded and made a few
half-hearted swipes at the top of the
service-bar with a towel that had seen
better days occasionally at this time
of the morning it seemed to him that he
had been going through this same
routine with this same pair of truck
drivers for at least a thousand years

  he thought wryly that sixty-two
years could seem a lot longer than a
thousand if you were the guy that
lived them-always accepting the fact
that you could call this a life he felt
his jaws crack in a yawn made no
effort to conceal it

  outside a truck roared past without
stopping enoch jones had already
turned off the bright red-and-yellow-
and-green sign that proclaimed the pres-
ence of enochs diner-tables pizza
dancing he thought of putting a slug
in the juke-box decided against it it
might cause the diesel drivers to linger

  yes sixty-two years could seem like a
thousand-plus enoch jones decided
usually he didnt allow himself to think
about it he didnt think about much of
anything any more-beyond the scant
mental requirements of facing every-
day existence

  he had long since learned that
thought was the door-key to recollec-
tion-and recollection was the stairway
to the attic of dusty and discarded and
broken and outworn dreams dreams
were things-if you could call them
things-that enoch jones had long since
decided were responsible for most of
lifes miseries

ttnoch jones had had his share of
them-perhaps mora than his
share his life he thought when he al-

lowed himself to think along such lines
had been dominated by dreams ever
since at the age of five and a half he
had first imagined the backyard puddle
that appeared with each february thaw
to be a pirate sea peopled by dolineux
blackbeard captain kidd-and paved
with pirate bullion

  that particular dream which invari-
ably found him striding a rocking quar-
ter-deck cutlass in hand defying muti-
neers and spanish sea captains simul-
taneously had not endured very long de-
spite its vividness and satisfaction for
other dreams each as vivid each as
satisfying had followed one another
with the years

  for awhile after the backyard pirate
sea dried up in the heat of early sum-
mer enoch jones had been a cowboy
with cattle-rustling variations riding
the wide loop and beating to the draw
lank lace-ruffled gamblers amid the
false-front dens of the great southwest

  he had been in turn big league base-
ball hurler fireman soldier hollywood
star football hero and-after a painful
pre-adolescent brush with the facts of
life-wall street financier each of
these dreams while it endured had filled
him utterly

  ultimately of course one king-sized
dream had come to erase the vigor of
all others to dominate his life it had
been born one saturday afternoon in
the local movie house when his age had
barely reached double figures

  the space-ship resting upright in its
desert cradle had been sleek beautiful
dangerous suggestive of the ultimate
in unknown adventure in blast-off it
had been incredibly beautiful and if in
its journey through space to the moon
the stars looked like pinpricks in a black
velvet curtain the ship itself had re-
mained as sleek and suggestive as ever
-especially in technicolor

  it had been only a hollywood fantasy
-but with it enoch jones had soared
free of the increasing encroachments of
the dull commonplaces of living from
then on he was a spaceman-even
though no scientist nor adventurer had
yet even to approach the long talked-of
short

conquest of space

 enoch jones spaceman - enoch
jones explorer of alien worlds-enoch
jones perhaps ruler of some strange
placet where no other human foot had
trod no other human voice been heard
this was the dream which after the
fashion of dreams had come to be enoch
jones-although perhaps it was the
other way around

  this was the dream that refused to
fade or be superseded in his imagina-
tion in fact the older he grew the more
it came to occupy his thoughts asleep as
well as awake gradually it began more
and more to shape-or as his parents
had implied-to infect his life

  enoch jones was not blessed in any
wordly degree his father was not rich
-quite otherwise since there were half
a dozen children and he was the second
oldest he had to go to work early he
drifted from job to job never able to
rise in such careers as offered because
his dream of space prevented sustained
effort

  so he became a short-order cook he
knew he would never get rich behind a
counter-bar-but he could do the work
satisfactorily by rote once he had mas-
tered its intricacies more important if
man reached the planets in his lifetime
someone would have to cook for them
there as well as on earth

  perhaps his logic was odd but it satis-
fied him he even began to pile up a
sizable amount of money in the bank out
of his modest earnings for if his dream
prevented his rise in the world it also
prevented his forming any of the usual
ties assuming any of the usual responsi-
bilities that eat up a mans savings

  marriage was not for him and the
girls seemed to sense it he did not
starve for women since his desires were
channeled otherwise and always some
female around would find his self-pre-
occupation a challenge he did all right
that way no miss americas perhaps
but then how many men did win beauty
prizewinners

  whats more he used to say occa-
sionally over a glass of whiskey with a
beer chaser how many of them that

order	

gets them like it after theyre stuck with
them

  there was no answer to that one

  enoch jones got around a lot too
when he got tired of a job or the season
turned sour hed have his savings con-
verted to travelers checks and take off
for a balmier clime he knew his busi-
ness and could get a job almost any-
where at any time this of course was
a planned factor in fulfillment of his
dream

  he didnt care much for the cities he
liked to work the places between towns
the little demi-communities that have a
way of springing up along the great
highways alongside the filling and serv-
ice stations the places where the long-
distance commercial drivers stop for re-
fuelling of gas tanks as well as the in-
ner man

  yes enoch jones got around it was
only after he had lost most of his hair
and had his upper teeth replaced by a
dental plate that the extent of his be-
trayal began to dawn on him and by
that time it was too late to do much
about it

one night much like this one when
he stepped outside after closing up
and looked up and down the highway
he had an odd impression that he was
just a kid on his first job working a few
miles from the small dark-white home-
stead-the place with the spring pud-
dle in the backyard from which his first
dream had sprung

  whats eatin you lover birdie
the dark-roots blonde who had shared
quarters with him in a shack behind
the garage down the highway asked
you look like you swallowed a herring
bone

  im okay enoch jones replied
im okay just thought of something
come on i got a quart of rye stashed
at the house

  he had figured the whiskey would kill
the thought that had troubled him but
it hadnt-and a few days later he had
moved on to try somewhere else he
hadnt wanted to face it but ultimately
he had had to
	startling stories

  all the places he had been-and each
one of them looked and sounded and
smelt and tasted just like the rest he
had worked miami winter playground
of the continent-and all he had seen
of it were neon signs and gas stations
and the inside of the dogwagon

  all he had heard was the rumble of
truck drivers slow chatter and the roar
of their trucks as they rolled by on the
concrete outside all he had smelt was
fuel and food odors-all he had tasted
was dogwagon food and not-too-mellow
whiskey and too-sweet lipstick

  it had been the same outside seattle
on route  near greenwich connecti-
cut on the montreal-quebec highway
and on the main drag beyond phoenix
arizona he had been places yes-about
as many as a man had a right to get-
but he might as well have seen have
been in only one

  enoch jones had begun to show his
age once this thought attained the
reaches of his conscious mind he knew
he had lost it lost whatever it was that
kept him going so long there were no
more birdies for him-the mollys being
women knew he had lost it with no ques-
tions asked yet he hadnt been able to
stop the habits acquired in a lifetime
held him chained to knife and apron

  he looked at the dirty-faced clock on
the wall saw that it was now one minute
of four come on fellows he said to
the two truck drivers i need some
shut-eye

  okay pop the one who had first
spoken yawned widely nudged the shin
of his companion with his heavy boot
we got to be goin ourselves see you
next trip old timer

  so long pop-give that molly a
smooch for me the other driver grin-
ning was on his feet they brought
their cups over to the bar-counter to
save him an extra trip they were good
boys enoch jones thought they
clumped on out into the night buttoning
their heavy felt coveralls and pulling on
their thick boots a blast of nostril-
stinging air accompanied their exit

  enoch jones turned off all but the
night light and got into his own heavy

outer garments it was cold enough out-
side to freeze the tail off a brass ele-
phant and he was too old to enjoy it
especially when he was bone tired the
hundred and fifty yards to the two
rooms he had in back of the filling sta-
tion seemed like miles

  he set the lock on the door and
slammed it behind him and paused out-
side nerving himself for the walk to
his waiting bed the roar of a diesel
motor catching with difficulty in the
cold of the night made him jump he
lifted an arm in salute as his two re-
cent customers rolled past sodium head-
lights slicing the darkness in eerie
death-yellow trim streamers

  he looked around him before begin-
ning his walk to shelter most of the
bright neon signs were darkened for
the remainder of the night but hogan
who ran the roadhouse-by courtesy
only-this side of the filling station still
had his signs glowing and the big bill-
boards lined the highway spottily ad-
vertising their various products from
digestion aids to cold cures to tires to
hotels

  it was cold but there was no snow-
there never was in this crazy climate
enoch jones was grateful for that
snow would have made his walk that
much the harder he began to slog off
past hogans to the filling station and
bed reflecting on the foolishness to
which a mans dreams could drive him

  he kept his head down-for even here
on mars he was sick of the fading rib-
bons that were highways in the night
sick of neon signs and dogwagons and
roadhouses and filling stations and two-
room shacks in which he no longer could
live alone from choice

  i never got anywhere after all he
muttered as the cold made his nostrils
stiff and a gust of wind all but stopped
him in his tracks not anywhere at all
in spite of all my travels

  he didnt even look up at the twin
moons above him-for at best deimos
and phobos were dull and tiny satellites
and in the bright glare of electricity
neon tubing and sodium lamps they were
scarcely visible at all

eliminating the strong and allowing the
weak to live on

  perhaps the dodo was lucky to last as
long as it did thanks to its eonlong isola-
tion from destructive forces in tasmania
but the chihuahua and the pekinese have
maintained themselves through adapta-
bility-in both instances through coopera-
tion with man a dominant species and the
wolf a far better equipped canine species
has been driven to the northland wastes
by his refusal thus to cooperate

  to date humanity has not had to adjust
to a symbiotic or other relationship with
a better-equipped species-but he is having
the devils own time adjusting to himself
in any reasonable sort of relationship at
all fortunately not all of our basic urges
seem to be competitive and therefore de-
structive

examples of sacrifice

  history contains far more examples of
sacrifice from damon and pythias to
father damien than it does of ruthless
exploitation in the name of security for
the individual our species has survived
such human scourges at atilla alexander
genghis khan napoleon and adolph hitler
only through this fundamental desire to
live in peace with itself

  further proof of the greater inherent
strength of those who give rather than those
who take-apart from the cataclysms of
war and nature-id quickly evident to any-
one who takes the trouble to make a survey
of the obituary columns of his local news-
paper granted only notables of more or
less degree get the write-ups but notables
whatever they are can supply us with
convincing proof as readily as greater
masses of the more obscure

  day by day week by week we find obits
written anent the pasing of driving indi-
viduals who have forced and forged their
way to the top in the competitive world of
business over a period of one month we
discovered the average age of these hard-
hitting aggressors at their passing to be
just a shade under fifty years

  across the same period we noted and
listed the professors artists physicians
and other folk who had attained distinction
in ways that were directly beneficial to the
communities in which they lived they

lived on an average some sixteen years
longer than their ulcer-building rivals
and the work they did represents some-
thing a lot more solid if perhaps less
tangible than whatever shares of att
common the competitors left in their pri-
vate vaults

  to be personally aggressive a man must
live in a world enclosed by the radius of his
own wants ambitions and personality if
he be generous such generosity can only
spring from the need of his ego to be ad-
mired he is very much a man in prison-
and prison restrictions have never fostered
survival

living for a purpose

  it is our well-founded hunch that sur-
vival for its own sake is not survival at
all but is rather the road to quick de-
struction it is not actually even a basic
human instinct save in situations of phys-
ical duress and even here the records of
our saints and war heroes prove otherwise
-not that is if we are to consider man a
reasoning being it seems more closely
allied to the popular concept of the pig
another much-maligned animal

  nor is such aggressive egoism funda-
mentally evil-for evil implies deliberate
attempt to harm others and the urge to
preserve self at all costs is merely a form
of panic it is rather a negation of the
whole purpose and history of humanity
worse it is ultimately as suicidal as any-
thing the lemmings have shown our ob-
servers in their supposedly mad mass race
for the north sea

  if we are to survive at all in this more or
less hapless age we must seek to live for
some purpose outside of ourselves this
it seems to us is our only remaining hope
we may not be the fittest if we do-but
at least we shall be the survivors

the reader contributions seem to ua
unusually live and controversial this
month what with the windup of our own
personal race racist controversy and
sundry other matters the weeding out
process has not been easy in fact the de-
partment threatens to run to greater length
than we intended so lets get to it with-

suggestion
by l lockhart layton

  dear ed i would like to make a request in
spite of your reluctance toward printing facts
in a magazine dedicated to fiction i think it is
an excellent idea many scientific facts and
theories at first glance appear to be much
stranger than fiction and are often more enter-
taining to one who enjoys a bit of mental ex-
ercise i would like to see a department in your
mag dedicated to strange and little-known
facts of science    scientific puzzles para-
doxes and mysteries it seems obvious that
there are many important bits of information
lying unused because they have not been called
to the attention of the right person

  of course i am not suggesting that you start
an inventors clinic im just trying to point
out that such a department would have great
possibilities i would like to issue a challenge
to other readers send in any unusual bits of
information you may possess and lets see if
we can make something of it it may be some-
thing that is considered detrimental to some
process or it may be something that is con-
sidered absolutely useless whatever it is lets
talk it over and see if we can turn it to some
advantage how about some letters

  i am personally interested in electricity mag-
netism and gravity there are a lot of ques-
tions to be answered about those subjects any-
way they tell me that is how science progresses
-by asking questions and searching for an-
swers any one can do it you dont need a de-
gree or an expensive laboratory just a normal
amount of curiosity and ambition- har-
wood street vancouver british columbia

  we may be asking for it l lockhart
but we like your idea-that is of course
if it appeals to sufficient number of readers
to get action a department devoted to
questions and answers of scientific and
scientifictional interest has possibilities

  furthermore we believe it should be up
to the readers to answer the questions sent
in and published therefore for the first
couple of issues if such contributions
appear we will run them in a questionbox
then when as and if we get answers we
will re-run the earlier questions and the
best explanations as well as a new set of
questions per issue this should keep every-
one up to date as well as scratching for
new answers

  now all we need is a title lets see-how
about ss reader quiz that ought to
do it you want to know what rhodomag-
netics are how to peel a tesseract without
a knife why is a parscc send us your
question on a separate piece of paper
include your answer too if you have one
and well run it and let the rest of the
interested readers do their worst thanks

for the idea l lockhart lets hope w
can get something under way

get another man
by edwin james

  dear mr editor an author can stand a
great many things but there is always a stick-
ing point dorothy parker recites a list of in-
sults which would not move her then adds

but say my verses do not scan

and i get me another man

  mr robert marlow who writes in your no-
vember  issue should not have said that
my story communications sept  was
illogical although he was perfectly within his
rights as reader and critic to find it uninter-
esting the latter adjective is subjective in
application but the former is capable of proof
or disproof

  mr marlow quotes so admirably in support
of his contention that physical transfer of mes-
sages on ships traveling faster than light would
be faster than radio-waves since electromag-
netic waves are restricted to the speed of light
he might well have quoted yet another passage
a little farther on in the story

     each signal is given a surcharge of
  energy from the same engines which send
  this ship into hyper-flight since the differ-
  ence in mass is enormous the speed of the
  signal is incalculable and the transmission
  time can be measured in seconds p 

  this of course has the support of no liv-
ing scientific authority but one would  uppose
that the speed of light limit is no more restrict-
ing on electromagnetic waves than on matter
the theory has in addition the elementary
logic that a given force will propel a lighter
object faster than a heavier one

  my only interest in this aspect of the story
of course was in providing a suitable and
logical background for my consideration of
the future of cryptography and its place of
eminence in a war between two interstellar foes
of equal power- massachusetts street
lawrence kansas

 cheer up edwin we liked communi-
cations too or we would never have
purchased and published it and it seems
to us we rallied round to its defense back
in the november ss very much along the
lines you suggest above heres luck with
your ma degree wed like to see the
thesis and hoping for reams of redhot
copy in the months and years to come

ley of the last marlow
by james k powell

  dear editor one of lifes little problems
turns up again a problem that always leaves
me with a feeling of disappointment muddled
thinking robert marlow n de p has in-
dulged in it a bit in his letter published in the
november issue of ss when mr ley replies
if he condescends to either mr marlow will
learn one small fact or he will blow the now-
famous lid
  mr ley i am happy to say was not con-
fused if my handbook of chemistry and phys-
ics is not confused also on this point the sur-
face acceleration of jravity at vancouver brit-
ish columbia elevation in meters  is 
g cmsecsec approximately  feetsecsec
by mr marlows own definition one gravity
of acceleration is equal to a velocity gain of 
ftsecsec   

  were it not for this constant surface accel-
eration robert marlow n de p would be
floating free somewhere in space so much for
your zero acceleration at the surface of our
world

  i have learned to read the letters first and
for this reason my letters to you cannot have
a rating of all the stories in this issue even a
partial rating might be more informative than
none

novelets	average

    tough old man-l ron hubbard 

  short stories

   love my robot-rog phillips

  i rated these stories on a personal system
dont we all i use four points in judging all
stories ratin from  to  on the arbitrary
points of characterization plot development
and ending the average is the rating my own
however the dialect in tall tale was above
average and i thought it only fair to say so

  i wish to say that i have enjoyed ss for
several years whenever i could find a copy
the serious lack of stf south of panama has
obliged me to catch up on my reading while
in the states and not spend my time writing
letters i will close now as i have a great
amount of reading to catch up on

  one last comment an echo to your devastat-
ing aside to that stf-illiterate rick dykeman
even i know a little about isaac asimov and
not entirely from the professorial angle

  i will try to say hello personally the next
time i am in new york if it is at all possible
the idea new to me that i might be admitted
to the sacred precmcts of the editorial offices
just never entered my head before you pointed
it out in the nov issue of ss thank you for
your great patience with just another of the
reader-fans and his epistolary efforts-bor

  thanks james k and we shall look for-
ward to receiving a visit from you here in
the foreseeable future poor marlow-he
seems to be getting it from all sides but
is he downhearted let him speak for
himself

n de p

by robert marlow

  dear ed i still dont agree with james on
fhe subject of his high speed radio in science
fiction we have a medium known as space wave
which is a super speeded-up form of radio
this however is not radio and should not be
called such pass this information on to edwin
james if you please

  as for willy ley i hope he answer my let-



ter with all his fury for i love to argue when
i have proof positive of my side of the battle

  you probably have realized that n de p
is my own original contraction for the words
nom de plume by now but if you havent
connected that stupid manuscript that you re-
jected two months ago with me then i will let
you know that robert marlow is the nom de
plume for robert w mckay thats me

  do you know that this last issue of yours is
very good your feature novel was so sound
in plot and so well written that i could hardly
believe that the story wasnt written by a e
van vogt or robert a heinlein the rest of the
material was good reading i suppose it was to
be expected for every one of your writers has
appeared before in a leading science fiction
magazine

  your editorial was quite interesting this
month i am also glad to see the revisions you
have made in your fanzine dept now to get
down to discussing ethergrams i would like
to see more poetry in the column i use the
term loosely

  i think that jack vance is better at writing
stories other than his magnus adventures
dont you agree you said that honolulu is
more of a race melting pot than los angeles
in your answer to the letter by bill morse i
am not an authority on either of these places
im not an authority on anything would be
more correct but i have inside information
that the big airport in newfoundland canada
sees at least one man from almost every coun-
try every day they dont live there but they
are there momentarily same thing almost

  i believe that this ridiculous controversy
over the negro question should not be allowed
to go any further any human being in his or
her right mind that would stoop to throw in-
sults at another living human being because
of skin color should be downright ashamed of
himself or herself

  who is the white man if someone told me
i was a white man i would hurry to see my
doctor for i would certainly be ill that is
the only time i am ever white and i am very
rarely ill so what more can i say albinoes
are white but they are rare if edwin sigler
is referring to the light-skinned race i see no
reason why we should be proud we the light-
skinned have accomplished most because we
have suppressed the other races and prevented
them from getting anywhere

  take a look at george washington carver
he was a negro and one of the greatest or-
ganic scientists in the history of the united
states in canada we have many chinese and
japanese people who put the average light-
skinned person to shame when it comes to
ambition and accomplishment you find very
few of these yellow men and women who
end up on skid row is it any wonder

  rick dykeman wants to know about isaac
asimov does he heres what i know about the
chap he has written many stories for many
of your better publications competitors he
also is listed with edmond hamilton l
sprague de camp ray cummings jack wil-
liamson and others as among leading s f
authors at the nycon consult your nor-
wescon program

i say my friends is wonder story annual
printed in canada i havent seen it anywhere

sorry i couldnt get down to see you all at
the norwescon i hope i can see you at nola-
con

  now to poetry aha a limarick

  an artist named bergey so daring

  paints a woman who little is wearing

  his aliens are green

  but his fcm is a queen

  so for petes sake my friend who is caring

   like to see van vogt in print

  his stories have a charming tint

  so print lots of them now
  for i love em and how

  cant you so-and-sos please take a hint

  recently in a leading magazine there was
a delightful story about the flying saucers from
venus and how they utilized magnetic force
as a means of propulsion i hoped that you
had read the article for it would truly let you
know that the flying saucer doesnt belong to
the united states-invermere british colum-
bia

  okay robert we are winding up the race
business this issue as promised but you
have to bring up them saucers to wit-

    no flying saucer have we seen
    in air so blue or sea so green
    but should we see one up above
    well send it on its way with love

  and by way of returning to the limerick
form-

    herr marlow would like us to float
    an issue made up of van vogt
    for heinlein or kuttner
    or anyone subtler
    he will not fork over a groat

  which would seem to be about enough
of that sorry willy ley has not poked his
heavy spectacles into the argument as yet

nothing to fool with
by l l shepherd

  dear editor this letter is motivated pri-
marily by two sentences in your fine thought-
ful editorial in the november issue i consider
these few lines answer the ages-old question
is there any true worth in reading science
fiction better than anything i have read on
the subject

  i shall quote them    science fiction is
nothing for the ward-heeler type of mentality
to fool with and remain a competent corrupt
human instrument it docs have a cathartic
effect upon the dogma-packed mind    and
that as you say is the finest thing that can
be said of it

  the proof that this is true is exemplified in
the contents of the letters of edwin sigler and
dorothy brown-nalls in this issue it is a
basic human trait to defend most ardently
those things we want to believe yet about
which we have many doubts the fact of hav-
ing doubts must be preceded by glimmerings
of wider thinking intelligent sustained
thinking is the nemesis of all dogma

  it is clear that sigler hasnt been reading
science fiction-nor been forced to think widely
-for very long a time his letter shows he is
well versed in certain dogmas to my way of
thinking dogmatic beliefs are only a polite
name for prejudices that have nothing to do
with the color of ones skin

  his statement our culture was built by
the white man is not correct it is much more
correct to state that white men conceived in
the constitution of the united states in this
nation a method for collecting improving and
co-relating the knowledge of all the races of
the world into a usable form that would not
as long as it was strictly abided by become
the tail that wagged the dog as all other forms
of government had done from time immemori-
able

  under it all men in this nation alone
achieved a freedom never before known to man
by the elimination of dogmas    and their
result prejudice from influence in their gov-
ernment he was correct to some extent in his
reference to aliens however it would have
been nearer right to have said the alien-
minded have made remarkable progress in de-
stroying these things through their ignorant
dogmatic teachings that have led to prejudice

  dorothy states her case very well however
she neglects to mention the one thing that 
have felt is the answer to the negros com-
plaint of lack of opportunity exponents of
the negros cause would do well to drum on
these facts as well as their current pet
themes the lot of the northern negro is far
superior to that of the average poor-white in
the south the lot of the downtrodden negro
of the south is far superior to that of the
average poor-white or native in most for-
eign nations    

  in addition the negro has progressed from
slavery to comparative freedom in less than
one hundred years in this nation the envied
white man that is so guilty of prejudice
against the negro has only been able to achieve
opportunity and freedom for himself in the
being of the average man in the last three
hundred years-and then only in the u s a
else why should there have been and still be
the huge influx of immigrants

  it couldnt have been the wilderness that
made it the land of opportunity a compar-
able wilderness lies mostly unsettled in the
continent to the south of us the modern con-
veniences of our present culture and the in-
ducements offered by the governments that rule
those lands are far superior to those available
during the first two hundred years to immi-
grants to this nation

  therefore one can only conclude that the
dogmas and their resultant prejudice that are
strictly in control of the established govern-
ments of these lands make them undesirable
even to the alien-minded that are so busy in
this nation and that if the constitution of
the united states was in effect there as it is
here the modern-day wagon trains would be
rolling south as they did to the west

  i doubt if the editor will print this how-
ever if he does i wish to add this thought-
i have become more tolerant with age how-
ever there is an old saying a man changes
his face often but he seldom changes his heart
therefore i find my feelings are not always
what i would like them to be the effort is
having its effect-at least in my part of the
world the white kids of today and the dif-
ferent ones too are much more tolerant than
they were even twenty-odd-years ago when i
was in school

  ill conclude this letter with a plea  let
us all read the wide clear there-are-greater-
things-than-man type of reading such as one
finds in science fiction-that causes the  ca-
thartic effect upon dogma-packed minds    
and remember although it is not perfect as
are not the parents of today  it is con-
tagious to others as demonstrated by the tol-
erance of the kids of today-post office box
no  litckfield illinois

  a letter whose honesty almost hurts
mr shepheard-and thanks incidentally
for the small nod to our editorial if we
have helped in any way directly or indi-
rectly to widen your heart we are grateful
but somehow we suspect that it needs
little widening we hope your plea finds
wide response among our other readers

north carolina letter
by m c taylor

  dear editor i agree with you that the racial
issue doesnt belong in an stf magazine nor
do i think it belongs in congress it belongs
to the people what -they do with it is a dif-
ferent matter

  i was bom in the south and raised in the
south rand im darned tired of people talking
as if-the south was a foreign country it seems
to me that people could remember that the
war is long over all you can hear now is
the racial situation im sick of it i wish
they would forget the itace part of it and
dwell on the actual situations

  it isp just the negroes that have fared
badly they simply have the largest popula-
tion what about the indians what about all
the jest of the supposedly inferior races

  ive seen good for nothing negroes indians
chinese and what have you but mr editor
ive seen some of the most good for nothing
whites too okay so what well heres what
during the last war there iyere indian heroes
negro heroes etc ralph bunche is certainly
not a man to be ashamed of bravery common-
sense and just plain decency know no color
line nor do shiftlessness laziness and outright
meanness bigots fanatics heroes and plain
damn fools come in all colors shapes andi ages

  im white and xf course im proud of it but
not far down the road lives a man just as
hlack ifis the inside of a coal bin and hes no
lesgjprovd of it why shouldnt he be pypud
why shouldnt i we were both torn that wy

  if every person would let very othe perspn
stand xn his own end not on his ancestors or
church r color orhvjiat fiave you my what a
ake world ye would haye 

  i think i would like tftfcnpw dorothy rown-
nalls she eounds like a real person my best
wishes toiler

  as for edwin igler-all i can say is a great
big nuts its people like him that ruin this
world with their -narrowmindedness i would
not like iy children to marry into another
fee bo bat not hecuac of the color or xce

but because the people like mr sigler would
make their lives a miserable existence

  because in a society filled with such people
there would be no room for their children
perhaps some day there will be tolerance i
dont like that word it speaks of condescen-
sion let me say understanding in the world
until then i say forget the race or negro issue
and remember the human situation

  equality be darned lets be friends until
there is true friendship between the people no
law can force equality

  well ive got that off my mind and im glad
ill keep on reading your mag and im not
asking what color are your authors either just
keep the good stories coming-po box si
arapahoe north carolina

  another large ladleful of honesty and
from-the-heart speaking mr taylor you
echo our own feelings in this highly im-
portant and highly delicate matter-even
to dislike of the word tolerance which
to us has always implied the act of enduring
while loathing agreed-you cant make
peoples behavior improve by any sort of
sumptuary legislation prohibition proved
that obvious truth for the millionth time at
vast communal expense education to ac-
ceptance without distaste of the fact and
foibles of others is the only answer and
we have a hell of a long way to go along
that road bub

anthropology speaks
by phillip barker

  dear sir as a fourth-year student in an-
thropology here at the university of washing-
ton may i insert a few comments into this
race discussion mr siglers remarks have
raised such a turmoil in scienco-fiction that we
hear reverberations clear out here in wash-
ington actually mr sigler statements have
nothing to do with fiction-and certainly less
to do with science

  however mr sigler supports scientific
achievement-the race that dares to dream of
the stars if so then he will be interested in
several scientific books written by men who
have made a life-long study of race and cul-
ture may i refer him to boas the mind of
primitive man kroeber race differences
and to the fallacy of race i cannot recall
the author

  the substance of these books is as follows
 there is no race but the human race 
national boundaries and linguistic boundaries
are not racial boundaries  differences be-
tween races are based solely upon different en-
vironments and different adaptations of this
very versatile human animal just think mr
sigler if your ancestors had gone south instead
of north way back in the pleistocene you
wpuld have probably been as dark-skinned as
the people you claim to despise  a person
from another racial group brought up with-
out prejudice in our western environment will
be a person of western culture entirely com-
pletely  the stupidity and laziness of
the american negro is not due to race but is
due to the low class he is kept in by the forces
of prejudice and hatred  a negro or a
chinese or an australian bushman can rise to
the same intellectual heights as any white per-
son on the average if his environment and
background is the same as that of the white
members of the community this is amply

firoven by the brazilian race mixing-pot which
acks race-prejudice and gives the same op-
portunities to both negroes and whites

  now then you make mention of interracial
marriage from all scientific findings sir the
only taint or stigma upon children born of two
races is the taint placed upon them by
prejudiced individuals in our culture

  you neglect the obvious factor of cultural
drive differences these have nothing to do with
race they are simply the peculiar drive or
direction in which one culture chooses to excel

  right now we are involved in a mechanical-
scientific cultural drive ever increasing our
knowledge concerning machines and natural
laws but five hundred years ago a mechanic
was one who dabbled in magic and the-drive of
those days was religion religion religion

  each culture has its rise its heights its
decline and its fall and each one excels in
different things these are not due to race at
one time for example the chinese were the
recognized scientific masters of the world at
another time the arab world held the scientific
reins before them were the greeks before
them the egyptians at one time the purely
negro culture of benin held prominence in the
science of metal working

  cultural drives change regardless of race
or religion cant you see sir that our modern
culture is just an outgrowth of the drive for
understanding of natural laws which started
long ago in pre-egyptian times and has been
handed on from culture to culture from race
to race like prometheus fire who knows
where it will go next perhaps as l sprague
de camp has theorized it will go to brazil i
would offer india as a possibility

  i am sorry to have thus taken up the editors
time but as a magazine which deals with
science i feel that a little anthropology is not
at all out of place now i should like to rate
the stories

  the five gold bands-superb vance is
excellent tough old man-a long way below
the above but still pretty good road block
-pretty good writing and plot love my
robot-entertaining pardon my iron
neryes--no comment hamilton how could
you tall tale-stick this in a separate
category mack reynolds is a new writer and
ought not to be forced to compete against the
old masters i enjoyed the story and want to
see more of him but of course he has a pretty
tough line-up to run against- south
stevens street tacoma  washington

  a nice hot letter with points well taken
if a trifle diffuse in spots and the stuff
about ancient cultural drives especially in-
triguing makes us wonder about those
immense and ornate south african ruins
built by heaven-knows-who and the vast
black basalt water-city of ponape whose
creators have yet to be assigned by arche-
ology maybe one of them was white but
we doubt it

the a-rut
by es  les cole

  dear snark you old shrewdy you putting
the sigler letter into print you knew durn
well that it would send up the blood pressures
of thousands of people all over the country
do you realize what it has done to us it is
going to elicit from us an answer-really a
futile thing

  weve indulged in these unproductive dis-
cussions before god knows how many times
weve heard all the arguments and weve
probably heard all the answers we attended
cal where if all the ideas on religion politics
and sex have not been expressed its only be-
cause they are dead the discussions are un-
productive because the gibsons can only nod
agreement while the siglers you couldnt touch
with a ten-foot pole you couldnt even touch
em with the eleven-foot pole constructed for
people you couldnt touch with a ten-footer
the siglers remain secure in their aristotelian
rut weve never yet heard of one being con-
verted   and we doubt if one could be

  what sigler needs is a course in basic nex-
ialism say nexialism ab the whole-ism of
the interrelationship of human cultures we
find it an item of regret that another human
being is incapable of appreciating the art
music mores and food though possibly not in-
cluding calameres of other groups of the spe-
cies

  but to the meat why do these people always
make a religious pilgrimage out of the argu-
ment inasmuch as we havent had a private
discussion with the living god lately we
feel singularly unqualified to comment on what
ideas are expressed in religious dogma this
business of throwing hims and his and
holy words we might add with a purely
emotional subjective meaning into the argu-
ment might help to convince a religious person
there is no sense in pointing out how the other
side feels about it especially those interested
in general semantics

  skipping however the controversial-unprov-
able material we ask what in the name of the
living god is a white man sigler has him
building our culture and we would be quite
interested in knowing who he is who are the
aliens who are tearing it down these ques-
tions are very important to us we have to
know at whom to direct our righteous anger
the last we heard the evil hordes directed from
moscow were tearing dowij our culture but
we slept late last night and there may have
been a significant change

  it fascinates us our culture we are certain-
ly glad to know it was built by the white
man we always thought it had its roots in
egypt china the near east and the medi-
terranean basin wed always considered its
origins in greek politics roman culture and
conquest spanish and portuguese exploration
and lately english imperialism wefre certainly
glad to know that a large portion of american
folk music is white including such materialas
casey jones oh dem golden slippers
swing low swet chariot etc

  or perhaps mr sigler refers to our pe-
culiarly american form of materialism we
refuse to comment on that well let a better
man do it for us see phil wylie practically
anything of social significance he has written
  there were rosay tests made to determine
whether there is a basic difference in intelli-
gence between negro and white while
we wont bore you with details-sigler can find
the scoop in any elementary psych text if he
is able to read-the results of course were
negative

  tsk tsk kiddo you put one of your pedal
extremities in it again picking on poor muriel
baxter that-a-way may we quote    be-
fox-e we got under way quell chore page
 that one drove us to the small dictionary
with the following results-quell    

v	i t  to cause to cease or yield by force
put down subdue

   to cause to subside calm mollify quiet
allay as pain  to kill

ii	i  to yield subside  to die

  quell old dear is from the anglo-saxon
cwellan die as if you didnt know we just
wish we had a big dictionary too but there
is more-

  quell n  poet or obs a weapon or
other means of subduing or quelling power to
subdue  murder

  that last is a most fitting climax to the dis-
cussion but so help us we didnt plan it that
way what you should do is can your proof
readers or stop trying to be so fatuous by
the way the correct form is either quel or
quelle-soioxh adeline st berkeley s calif

  tsk tsk yourselves and here all this
time we have been wandering about in our
innocence believing nexialism something
the grik gods drank out of a shoehorn or
something shades of l sprague de camp
your racism requires no answer those
big dictionary quests are fun occasionally-
especially as almost always something turns
up as fitting as your quelling with murder
which is why we indulge once in a while

  as to your comment anent some of our
other activities as against our editorial
capabilities carefully deleted from your
letter we feel in somewhat the same mood
as edwin james a few letters back how-
ever the story in question was to us
a horrifying thing when we finally saw it
in print we shuddered by then it had
been thoroughly butchered in the process
of cutting it to fit an overdue rent bill
maybe youll find something happier in
work soon to appear in this and other
stf magazines

sidewinders preferred
by john p conlon

  dear editor i returned from europe in
forty-five after an argument with some gents
who included in their ranks a corps of lads
selected for size race appearance and so forth
unfortunately they used to make soap and
lampshades of their customers the ss trooper
was a carefully selected person but i would a
dmn sight sooner associate with a mojave
sidewinder with all their hollering over the
race question they wound up allowing th nips

vm

krim tatars mongols hungarians rumani-
ans and so forth to be honorary aryans

  as for dreaming of the stars the heathen
chinese had good observatories while many of
our ancestors were using each other for chow
purposes they aint made many changes in
the world but they aint having conscience
pains from making a-bombs

  there are differences in outward appearance
among the various races of man but the basic
equipment is the same a lot of prejudices arise
from relations between the man with the whip
and the pore working stiff the only real alien
today is the communist whose behavior is
alien to any civilization except the new guinea
cannibal

  i soldiered in the regular army with a
group of men who represented all the tribes
of europe i enlisted with an old soldier of the
irish republican army and what i know about
the service i learned from a lithuanian cor-
poral as for filth there was a lad in my unit
down south whose color was hard to tell-
until his squad leader and a couple of guys
with sensitive noses escorted him to the shower
with a gi brush there aint any inferior
races-only inferior individuals- columbia
street newark ohio

  and that as they say is telling them
mr conlon at any rate it will serve to
wind up this tumed-on toaster of a sympo-
sium that has been raging ever since mr
sigler replied in heat to mr joe gibsons
letter in answer to miss lopezs note in
our march issue-which is long enough
for any controversy to endure in a letter
column-especially when it has nothing
directly to do with stf thanks for the
letters all of you who did not get into
print were right proud of you-all

heads down
by joe gibson

  dear ed whup keep your heads down
boys shes a leetle rough in through here-
whereupon i crawl wriggle and mud-paddle
up to the op of eugene deweese who shall
henceforth be called indiana now indiana sez
we ought not to make tev a battleground i
agree i got an allergy to battlegrounds i am
sure corporal mclamarrah canuck morse
ollie shannon and one of the coles at least
will happily join me in a round of five-card
poker in the nearest liberated distillery
gasthaus or bier-keller are you there les

  it all places me in a somewhat golden mood
of reminiscence please lemuel leave me in-
dulge myself for this nonce twas maybe
fifteen maybe twenty years ago that the letter-
columns of the stf mags were all-male to a
vast and nauseating degree with only one
letter or so every few months from any female
stf reader

  so a bunch of guys of high and noble in-
tellect devised a bit of nefarious witticism
they commented to ye eds that science-fietion
was obviously a mans bailiwick that women
just couldnt enjoy it because there were no
frills or fripperies that the one or two old
maids who did hang around were probably just
out on bail anyhow we were brave lads in
those days

  and gazooks-did we get our ears pinned
back and man oh man did we love it ever
since then somehow or other the gals have
always boen around femmes like la belle
zimmer-biadley whose merrie-mayking
mongst the general repartee has always been
welcomed with loud huzzahs from us knights
of the round table much i hope to her sheer
feminine delight but-now isnt that people
for you

  and for youngsters like shelby vick of
florida let me say there are as many beau-
tiful dames among stficcionados as hell find on
any local beach or well it just might be the
conditions in florida that states a catch-
all for broad-beamed tourists anyway re-
minds me somewhat of new jersey all the
pretty tourists are out west

  but to have ones letter published in a
letter-column one usually must expect cer-
tain results some mail-order houses put your
ziame and address on their sucker list but they
usually scratch it off after twenty or thirty
come-hither circulars are ignored a good
thing though is that you certainly get
an opportunity to acquire any stf stories
youve missed and always wanted fandom
is chuck-full of crazed collectors and eager
dealers

  also there are the good fellows shannon
now has read stf for twenty years-and is
this his first letter to tev i wonder if hes
ever sat down with a good fellow to recall
those old weinbaum days when heroes went
jumping into space without spacesuits hold-
ing their breath and all the first-trippers to
the moon found weird intelligent creatures and
flora

  as mechanics have shop-talk and pilots have
hangar-talk so fans have fan-gabs in clubs
and via correspondence where one is likely
to be discussing authors and stories one mo-
ment and probable sol-type stars in the earth-
type planets the next the present topic of
interest seems generally to be how science-fic-
tion can be improved so its boom of popularity
wont do a sudden reverse

  but the more cooks who join in of course
the bigger the head on the broth seems i
just vaguely recall meeting one lemuel mutton
at last julys new york stf conference who
said there was a slight bulging of the walls of
the mail dept down at  east th due to
some lamebrained fans brash essay i am
now sewing buttons back on my shirt but
may those walls continue to bulge chum

  yep all in all its as satisfying a hobby
as can be has its surprises too i must say
so you write a story about a farmer who be-
comes a senator now someplace thats gonna
hit a farmer whod like to be a senator-did
i say that riirht yeah okay so somebodys
gonna get a kick out of the yam

  so a girl wondered why the dark races
werent represented in stf-for about the same
reason it seemed to me i grew up in new
mexico where the populations about 
spanish americans which was muy bueno
with me and a couple of my finest school-
chums were colored boys-you can imagine
what a surprise dorothy brown-nalls letter
was but-well enough of this

  and with mac and ollie and canuck and

the rest of the gang i shall happily wend my
way through the winding streets of some
quaint village rattling the chimney-pots with
lusty song and pausing perhaps to gaze
with sadness at any glare of fire or sputtering
of guns on the far horizon indeed no battle-
grounds please the way things look we may
get into that soon enough and it wont be
figurative so speaks this jerque from old
albuquerque-u kensington ave jersey city

	n j

  we love your letter joe-and dont get
us wrong it has spirit emotional appeal
nostalgia of sorts camaraderie chutney
sex-appeal and a dash of basil but what
in hell does it mean please write us again
by way of explanation

futurefolk
by nancy moore

  dear editor since you were nice enough to
print my last letter i have decided to honor
you with another lucky lucky you first
i think i can help brother austin on the story
hes trying to find in the fall  issue of
planet stories-i suppose ill be censored
here-there was a lead novel by eando binder
called vassals of the master world where-
in earth is enslaved by a planet called tharkya
all the inhabited planets of our galaxy were
likewise enslaved and forced to deliver one
gram of energon to tharkya yearly as tri-
bute hero falls in love with a venusian girl
i think and they live happily ever after
could be this is the story youre trying to
find buz

  on to the latest startling pardon my
iron nerves was very good as it has been
said before captain future belongs to a dif-
ferent era in scientifiction the old cf stories
were good and well received when they were
published but the dyed-in-the-wool stfan is
looking for a little more than thud an blunder
in his reading so i suggest you keep the cur-
rent series of cf stories well sprinkled with
humor theyre better that way

  tall tale seems to me the sort of story
that might find its way into an anthology in
a year or so incidentally i met mack reynolds
at the norwescon hes a pretty swell guy
and takes his writing very seriously lets
have more of his work

  rog phillips has done much better than
love my robot and how this ever got into
ss ill never know rog will probably pin my
ears back for this when he sees me again
but- lmr was the worst story in
the issue there ive said it and im
glad glad do you hear

  now to a subject currently under discussion
-we fen seem to enjoy thinking of ourselves
as a group of future people i e mentally
superior in more ways than one still there
seem to be some of us who will look down our
noses at someone whose skin is a different
color

  s-f authors often discuss tolerance toward
extra-terrestrial races can we even hope to
stay on friendly terms with martians or
venusians when there are those among us
who condemn the other fellow because of a
different shade of epidermis
  were not even ready for something like
space travel when we still have with us some-
thing as downright stupid as racial intol-
erance i think that expresses my personal
views

  ill close this with a limerick lets hear
you answer this one ed-

i dislike bergevs women they bulge
in places unflattering to them
they curve where they shouldnt
and bend where they couldnt
and should get the waste-basket due them

  okay but how come your first and second
lines dont bulge-i mean rhyme to put
the limerick in your own ie the n moore
or no-more form sans bulges form we
would have to do this-

  the places where bergeys babes swell
are those that cause strong men to
whistle

  their sub-breastplate bumps
  are sure cures for male dumps
  and bring us in many an epistle

  whereas and however not to mention
nonetheless your true limerick should run
as follows-

  the places where bergeys babes swell

  wring from every true male a loud yell

  their curves callipidgious

  are so prestidigious

  they tell the world why adam fell

  at any rate perhaps you have the idea
by this time if you dont you probably
never will

from all angles
by captain kenneth f slater

  dear un-nameable nov ss turned up a few
days ago beauteous near-nude on cover as
always i know it is not your fault but i do
wish something could be done about those
covers for my money they are the only thing
that prevent the sstws twins from heading
the field for all-round excellence among the
good bad and indifferent s-f and fantasy mags
which are flooding into the market in steadily
increasing numbers there are one or two that
outshine yours in some specific way but none
which can be relied upon to give such good
stuff from the all ancles point of view

 jack vances five gold bands was
good but not quite up to par the plot seemed
to be somawhat forced and the action strung
out too much best two tales in my opinion
only were the hubbard novelet and the
phillips short the humor in ed hamiltons
tale rather spoiled it shame cos it had to
be funny didnt it there will be umpteen
folk disagree with me of course actually
id almost been converted to liking captain
future and crew now i am right back hating
their intestines

  tall tale mack reynolds was more
amusing from the lighter side than the



future item williams road block was

good tho theme is not new he gave it rather
special treatment i liked-if it could have been
longer it couldnt very well have been id
have rated it above rog phillips yarn

  fraid there is not much news from this
side of the water but one item to note is
that nova pubs have put out the second
string-walt gillings mutated science-
fantasy im sending you a copy    and
youll note it is not as good as wed hoped it
would be

  this new scheme of fanzine reviewing is
not so good at least you previously pre-
vented a complete waste of money by fans 
gave them some idea of what theyd get for
their sub i rather think that from here-on
inclusion in part ii of your listing will mean
no subs-but that is the fanzine-editors own
fault i guess

  i cant follow the reasoning behind some of
their complaints  do any of them honestly
expect to make a profit on publishing a fan-
zine excluding such items as fantasy
advertiser naturally and why they
should take exception to a few well-intended
hints that they were below average gets me
fandom must be growing up with thin skins
these days

  it is not so long back that folk were being
positively and absolutely rude to each other
anyway what real harm does it do to sav
something is not worth buying-not that i
can recall you being quite that outspoken it
tells the editor that he has got to buck his
ideas up and it warns other fairs from laying
out the hard-earned buck for  copies of
something you can not even use for wrapping
paper

  back in sept  you told me that opera-
tion fantast needed its hair brushed
did i write back and complain that you were
stopping folk subscribing no i took a meta-
phorical brush and comb to the zine and cleaned
it up i may have cussed you under my breath
at the time but i took the hint-is gp rpc
b aor  eo gpo england

 something has been done about our
covers as you doubtless know by this time
hope you approve the changes sex is
definitely not out but we intend to make
it a bit more palatable when employed and
to use other varations and ideas when
as and if we can

  actually the new fanzine review sys-
tem is far sounder than the old outside
of the standouts we could give the bulk
of them little more than a cursory glance-
through so our comment was hardly re-
liable for a shoppers guide now we have
a chance to study completely the best-
appearing jobs without cluttering ourselves
up with the others-yet at the same time
we give them a listing

  seems to me the ten-list should be at
least as worth while shooting for as the
old a and b business

  we sew one of the gillings books anj
liked immensely ken hope your gang over
there gets out of its technical doldrums
soon certainly britain is teeming with
loyal and alert fans-one should be pro-
ductive and would be if they could we
hope they get the chance

baby sitter issue
by anna lee mcleod

  dear editor starting off this epistle with a
smile i must congratulate you for putting
out one issue the november one which is
greatly suited to all feminine fans who are
mothers of demanding one-year-olds when my
darling daughter was asleep i was able to get
in a half-hour or so at a time of reading on
the short stories i think your selection was
most excellent this time also the old man
had such a grand surprise ending and i liked
the one bout the prospector who saw the
rocket-ship in fact they all were good

  but now comes a gripe i wish that you-all
would give this forlorn californian a chance
to be happy i would like to know just how
to get letters from other stf fans and what
does a person have to have to get into tev
for good like the coles and ed cox etc

  living in maryland is like being on the
moon-plenty dead i would like to know
where to find a science fiction society to join
even by mail sos-im lonely see what
you can do nonny-mouse please-apartment
s  south union ave iiavre-de-grace
maryland

  shuck maam yo-all caint be lonely down
there in the heart of the tannenbaum coun-
try not while warm hearts and southern
chivalry still flourish ask any northern
racetrack reporter following a preakness
weekend seriously maryland and the moon
have little in common take over maryland
as for getting into tev for good as you
put it just keep writing interesting letters

  incidentally the prospector who saw
the space-ship in the mack reynolds story
tall tale was a very real and fabulous
figure in the countryclubification of the pre-
civil war west it was jim bridger who
first discovered yellowstone for the white
man and his stories of old faithful and
the like were considered riotously tall
tales by his hard-bitten comrades-until
later confirmed we dont know whether or
not he actually did see the space or rather
time-ship however as the story points out
he lacked the nerve to tell that one

with foot in mouth
by earl newlin jr

  dear ed i knew you war talented bat i
didnt know yop war a ocmtortkmi however
yon neatly stock your foot in yonr month h

this startling november issue you tell os the
robot-versus-man story is threadbare and m
the same ish yoa eon not one bt two robotales

  of course you dont find me complaining
about this im a sucker for robots i could
become quite fond of a cute little metal mon-
ster but this is merely because im a psychiat-
ric pervert there are a lot of us perverts
around who have emotional feeling for things
much less animate than a robot things like
old shoes speed-boats pocket knives   

  anyway love my robot was a good tale
also the appearance of rog phillips yah yah
i know his names graham but it gripes me
to see characters refer to a penname author
by his true name it gets confusing and its the
same as saying hey look at me i know his
real name so i am an experienced fan was
welcome

  i liked the other robotism too say ed i
have a brilliant idea next time i make a robot
ill put some revolving lop-sided wheels in his
head then he would have a distinct personal-
ity hed be eccentric

  i wont bdre you by rating the rest of th
stories because i havent read them yet but
i will comment upon the cover some bergey
fans will like it shouting we want flesh
large feminine expanse of soft pink flesh

  maybe you could talk bergey into doing an
abstract cover ah i can picture it now beau-
tiful scantilyclad circle being protected by
handsome dashing square and looming in the
background we find a hideous writhing bng-
eyed-rectangle cute huh

  i wish id have been around when all that
sarge saturn business was going on    why
we new fen dont even know what it was all
about could you give us a sample just one
painless paragraph aw come on

  im glad there are gals in fandom but   
first we must assume that they are intelligent
as shelby vick did now if a dame is intelligent
enough to like the same type of fiction a lot
of the males do ahem    then they are
most probably un-beautiful most of the aver-
age female reading is of the intimate pas-
sion mags

  therefore and wherefore not to mention to
wit whereas we could assume that they had
an average mentality that was a little-
warped most of the beauties i know arent
interested in anything but male animals tsk

  i dont see who started the rumor that an
stfan had to be intelligent anyway a lot of
swill in other mags and sometimes in yours
is pure adventure with very little emphasis on
unusual concepts how about a lead novel of
 pages of mathematical formulae if you
ever need any more original ideas ill help
you out next month in tws- peck atw-
nu san antonio  terasu

  help us out and under the fore-jets of
some ambulating mereurian meat wagon
you spawn of the outer satellites fah
bring on the xeno frogeyes this diluted
half-measure of plutonian dishwater is
more than we can bear had enough earl
we have-in fact we had it years and years
ago when w interred the sarge and his
gruesome pets in a fur-lined hogshead of
arcturean brandy double-distilled

  you seem to belong in the square cate-
gory yourself kid or worse among the
flats-which according to eddy condon
are squares lying down

bouquets for rog
by janie lamb

  dear ed you did it you did it and heres
a big beautiful bouquet for you but how in the
world did you manage it blackmail or bribery
ill bet you offered the poor starving guy
money of course im talking of your adding
rog phillips to your list of writers nice
work	

  hamilton outdid himself on this captain fu-
ture yarn i like a taste of humor in my stories
pardon my iron nerves had it vance was way
below par better feed him some cream o
wheat

  i always turn to the readers corner firstest
but this time whew i begin to think the dear
ole ed had spilled some fried garlic in the let-
ter section he eats it for lunch its a secret
though but when i finally located the odor
twas only siglers letter

  and now ed a hearty amen to your prom-
ise of no mo letters on the racial question in
ss theres no place for it in stf circles
squares either some seem to think racial
prejudice is the seed of slavery taint so
cause look at the trouble moses had with his
family because he loved and married a colored
girl and as wise as solomon was he lamented
the fact his skin was black had there not
been racial prejudice then would he have
cared if he was black or white the negro
would have been far happier and progressed
farther if they had been given a reservation
like the indians but lets keep this feud out of
fandom regardless of what any of us think
or want racial prejudice is here to stay-

 solomon black old man mose in love
with a lydian lady reservations for ne-
groes and not on the superchief youve
got us in a spin janie no foolin and just
when we thought that one was all wrapped
up for the dustbin ah well write us again
anyway although your logic eludes us com-
pletely it has a sort of eerie charm-yours
and gibsons confidentially we used neither
blackmail nor bribery on roger p a press-
gang did the job for us with dispatch

     you write

its much simpler than you think

c o many people with the germ of writing in
them simply cant get started they suffer from
inertia or they set up imaginary barriers to taking
the first step

  many are convinced the field is confined to per-
sons gifted with a genius for writing

   few realize that the great bulk of commercial writing is
done by so-called unknowns

  not only do these thousands of men nnd women produco
most of the fiction published but countless articles on busi-
ness hobbies sports travel veterans affairs war experi-
ences human interest stories local and club activities
etc as well

  such material is in constant demand every week thou-
sands of checks for   and  go out to writers
whose latent ability was perhaps no greater than yours

the practical method

  newspaper work demonstrates that tho way to leorn to
write is by writing newspaper copy desk editors wasto
no time on theories or ancient classics the story is tho
thing every copy cub goes through the course of prac-
tical criticism-a training that turns out more successful
authors than any other experience

  that is why newspaper institute of america bases its
writing instruction on tho copy desk method it starts and
keeps you writing in your own home on your own time
and upon the very same kind of actual assignments given
dally to metropolitan reporters thus you learn by doing
not by studying the individual styles of model authors

   each week your work is analyzed constructively by prac-
tical writers gradually they help to clarify your own
distinctive style writing soon becomes
easy absorbing profitable too as you
gain the professional touch that gets
your material accepted by editors

above all you con see constant progress
week by week as your faults ore cor-
rected and your writing ability grows

have you natural ability

our writing aptitude test will re-
veol whether or not you have natural
talent for writing it will analyze your
powers of observation your imagina-
tion and dramatic instinct youll en-
joy taking this test there is no cost

ali and desired to indulge my sadistic im-
pulses to the full

  but no no i no you had to go and fill the
november ish with the best damn stories i
have read in a long time in any magazine my
day was ruined dammit they were good i
suffered interminably that day i sat down
and enjoyed the five gold bands so
much that i cried out in frustration how
could i pan such a story as that there was
no way it was good

  i am accustomed to the fact that vances
magnus ridolph series is terrific still
i could hope that there would be no mr story
in that ish indeed when i saw that vance
had been trying another type of story i felt
jubilant here says i was where he had gone
too far out of his element i figured his stuff
would be horrible but was it oh no you
had to publish a good lead novel this time

  but that wasnt enough for you even the
novelets were terrific pardon my iron
nerves is the hottest thing that has hit ed
hamilton since the beginning of the future-
men and having it written in the first person
by a ro-excuse me i mean grag was indeed
novel has that ever been done before and
then there was tough old man now i
know hubbard is a clear and therefore what
could i expect but a good story and it was-
it was your coup is complete

  to add insult to injury even the short
stories were tops who could possibly con-
demn rog phillips anyway and how could
anyone pan love my robot it was sci-
ence-fiction in the best style tall tale also
rates this category every bit of it was anthol-
ogy material

  i have one redeemer road block now
the writing was ok but the story wasnt
finished for some reason i like to have a final
or semifinal conclusion to a story road
block was one of those types that describes
something with great possibilities and then
finishes leaving the reader up in the air

  but the mag as a whole-i mean the con-
tents-was wonderful you couldnt have done
better on a bet- park place r d no i
pittsburgh  pennsylvania

  go ahead and be as sadistic as you wish
bill we dote on it simply dote on it and
road block was so finished

siew or siue
by j e clarke

  dear sir i have never written a fan letter
to any magazine i have read every number
of this mag since it started publication i read
science fiction for the enjoyment i get from
it i think that it is only fair that i express my
appreciation for the many happy hours that
the pern sal of this publication has given me
the stories are all good only some are better
than others

  i have just finished reading the nov 
number the stories are improving right along
i cant find the name of the editor any place in
this mag i think that i know the reason for
that-he probably has only a number i de-
duce this from the fact that on page  he
savs ugh praise allah we were never a
child

  could it be that he is a robot conditioned
and trained to be a science fiction editor that
would tend to explain the increasing excel-
lence of his material if i am right in this
matter there are a whole slew of questions
that id like to ask

  i especially like l ron hubbards stories
i think that he showed remarkable restraint
in not mentioning dianetics in this last story
i believe that l sprague de camp disagrees
with ron on that subject i havent read a
bad captain future story yet

  the inside art work agrees favorably with
the general makeup of the magazine and the
cover picture is good but i cant help wor-
rying whether that little string will continue
to hold up that dinky apron nobody else is
printing any better stories than startling
and i read about half a dozen others and
should know im  years old and am probably
your oldest reader

  i started reading the letters in the present
issue using a pair of magnifying spectacles
then after a while i started using a large
reading glass but even that didnt help for
long some of the letters are interesting i
feel that the discussion of racial differences
should have no place in these letters given
equal educational and training opportunities
all of them are about equal in brain power-
 lighthouse ave pacific grove cali-
fornia

  robotic editors yet-brrrrr at that it
might come in handy to have one or more
around scuttling out to interview fans and
so on more seriously mr clarke your let-
ter gives us a desire to know just who our
oldest reader is how about it all of you
will you send in your nominations well
be glad to publish an occasional photograph
if it is clear enough for screen reproduction
with which we hereby inaugurate an oldest
ss fan contest

-the summing up
by robert p hoskins

  dear muttonhead the date august thirty-
first the year of our lord one thousand nine
hundred and fifty the above mentioned year
is two-thirds gone or so one would think but
wait what is this

  the latest issue of startling appeared
two days ago and is dated november which
means that the year has vanished before our
eyes there will be no more issues of dear old
ss dated this year so the time has come the
walrus said to speak of many things of the
best of novels novelets and author queens and
kings oh well it rhymes

  appropriately enough we shall start out by
listing the six novels in their proper place ac-
cording to my own insignificant personal opin-
ions

 i	wine of the dreamers by john
d macdonald i think you mentioned some-
time back that there might be a slim chance
of its being made into a movie thatd be one
of the best things to hit the silver screen since
talkies and color
 ii	the lady is a witch by norman
a daniels some fan didnt like it fie on
them another good bet for the movies

 iii	the city at worlds end by
old world-wrecker hisself as in my letter
in the current ss i say a sequel a
dozen of them

 iv	the five good bands by jack
vance im still reading it but i can already
tell im gonna love it more of the same in
novel-length from vance

 v	the cybernetic brains by ray-
mond f jones superb bit of writing by the
way are we gonna see some more stuff about
cal meacham

 vi	the shadow men by a e van
vogt at the beginning of the season i was
gonna rate it best but you surprised me by
coming out with more and more super-superb
stuff

  that little chore be through next we find
the novelets will only rank what i considered
to be the top three as there are too many of
them will do the same with the shorts a
pause while i go over the list of them again

  i	roman holiday by kelvin kent tops
on my list of novelets am thinking of making
a list of my favorites in each classification
rh would be about third in several hundred

 ii	pardon my iron nerves by ed-
mond hamilton i read the hubbard nvt in
the latest ish before this one and i thot that
that had hit the peak of egotism in a character
constable moffat but i read grags own
story next believe me i didnt even try to
conceal my emotions my sides still ache

 iii	children of the sun by edmond
hamilton this was tough but captain future
scored again hamilton and his band have
taken two out of three in  i hope they
can do it again all i can say is all power
to them

  and last but not least we are down to the
shorts this is gonna be the toughest job of
all wait im forgetting the artwork and i
thot i was gonna have a rest soon but on with
it

 i	stars over santa claus by wil-
liam morrison cute little tale samachson is
tops when it comes to shorts dunno why i
did it but i have chosen him for first and third
spots again one author stealing from his pals

  ii	down the river by mack reynolds
in a way it carries a good message too bad
everyone cant be forced to read it and i
mean everyone illiterate persons could have
it read to them teach this old world to mind
its ps and qs

  iii	disappointment by william mor-
rison i see again that several fen didnt like
it any of you boys wanna fight good youd
make good sparring partners for some pugilist

 that such a critter actually exists

   a few last minute notes you have published
 a total of thirty-nine stories in ss in the past
 year contrary to one fans opinion in a recent
 ish of tuckers sf news letter the qual-
 ity of your material is not going down but com-
 ing up

   i think vernon mccain has a good idea in his
 letter i know i thought about entering fandom
 for at least two years before i finally did and
 the only reason i finally did was because i was
 in an extra-ambitious mood one evening with
 nothing to do you now know what i chose to
 do to pass the time dont you sometimes wish
 that you had never been born or better yet
 that no fan had ever been born-lyons falls

   now that its over we cant say that we
 do although there were moments in the
 course of preparing the above peristyle 
 but enough said its all more or less in fun
 or at least in controversy once again you
 all seem to have come up and in with plenty

 hoping its hotter yet come may you might

well it had to happen apparently-
thanks to our limiting our list of

cabbage has overflowed the pot to maintain
our top-ten listing we are going to have
to give a number of deserving fan publi-

  arthur c clarke b sc scarcely an x-
factor to any of you has sent us along the
most recent copy of the erudite journal of
the british interplanetary society which
is led off by the printed version of a speech
delivered in london before the society by
mr clarke himself its title is space-travel
in fact and fiction and apparently the fact
that it was originally delivered on april
first last has no bearing upon its remorse-
less peerings into stf primitives

  also included among other articles and
reviews are a study of space rocket tra-
jectories by dr samuel herrick and an
a v cleaver review of hollywoods desti-

reviews of new books

  by george orwell signet books new york c

   to us by far the most important single
appearance of the most prolific month to
date in stfantasy publishing is the appear-
ance of the late george orwells great novel
in c form since this terrifying and mag-
nificent conception of the blind alley into
which current trends social military and

 political may lead us-some say are leading
 us-has already been reviewed to a crisp
 dark brown we shall here give it no more
 than an enthusiastic re-indorsement

   suffice it to say that those who dont seize
 upon this opportunity to read or reread the
 appalling tragedy of winston smith julia
 and obrien under the aegis of the all-per-
 vasive big brother should have their heads
 and emotions examined one of the great
 books of our time-and one of the few great
 books of all time with definite stf interest

 the man who sold the moon by robert a
 heinlein shasta publishers chicago 

   an extroadinarily interesting volume
 composed of a half dozen of mr heinleins
 famed future history series its inaugural
 studies which depict with enormous con-
 viction the progress of man from his dis-
 ordered present into a future which though
 still plenty disorderly manages to take him
 ultimately to the stars after a number of
 false starts and failures

   a number of the stories included parti-
 cularly the roads must roll have been
 previously anthologized but their author

is one whose best work and this is his best
work stands up beautifully under the acid
test of rereading but to us a previously un-
seen effort the short novel from which the
title is derived is the standout

  delos d harriman the man who man-
ages to get first others and then finally-
and almost too late-himself to earths
atellite is a fascinating character combin-
ing candor and the unceasing urge to follow
a dream to its end with humor and a
professional deviousness that machiavelli
might have envied

  he gets to the moon-yes but in order
to do so he has to involve himself and his
hard-shelled colleagues in a series of pro-
motional pyramids that are reminiscent if
far more skilful than those indulged in by
the late samuel insull the story is remark-
able not only for its human appeal but for
the ingenious and loving care lavished on
the mechanics of quasi-legal big-business

  a fine adult job all the way

the house that stood still by a e van vogt
greenberg publisher new york 

  this is an odd piece of fantasy-which
manages to straddle the two poles of mys-
tery and science fiction it deals with an
ancient mansion on a california hilltop
which was standing there long before the
conquistadores appeared from the south to
take over its occupance and concomitant rule
of the surrounding countryside

  it has remained in the americanized
hands of descendants of the spanish oc-
cupiers and is run through an agent allison
stephens an ex-marine who soon finds him-
self up to his neck in bodies quick and
dead ancient mysteries cabals of the pres-
ent and one mistra lanett a sort of eternal
woman apologies to mrs d d sharp

  what it is all about remains obscure to
stephens and in large part to the reader
until at the storys end the true nature of
the ancient house is unveiled this is a tour
de force packed with unsuspected surprises
we have no intention of revealing here if
the story has a tendency to fall at times
between its mystery and science fiction anti
podes-well for the most part it holds inter-
est if not a great deal of sense

the dreaming jewels by theodore sturgeon
greenberg publisher new york 

  a fascinating and very unusual story as
mr sturgeon tells us of young horty bluett
the boy who seems to those who know him


 to have anteater blood horty knew he was
 different of course-but was not aware
 of the extent of his variance from the hu-
 man norm until he lost horribly three
 fingers from one of his hands

   the fingers grew back by themselves and
 horty began to get the idea from then on
 he went in search of his fate a fate inex-
 tricably involved with the alien jewles that
 were not jewels at all with number of
 strange men and women in a number of
 strange environments including a travel-
 ing freak show

   mr sturgeon has built his story upon a
 solid interweaving of conflicts and charac-
 ters that cause it to build almost unbear-
 ably to a climax which in suspense and vivid
 bizarreness reminds one inescapably of
 something alfred hitchcock might have
 tackled via the movies but has not yet so
 done a swell story

 conan the conqueror by robert e howard
 gnome press new york 

   this is a neo-arthurian saga of the color-
 ful derring-dos of an age of magic and
 chivalry existing in some phantom era be-
 fore the continents of earth divided up to
 form the present land-masses conan its
 principal figure is a prime adventurer who
 has won himself a kingdom and must regain
 it after being dislodged by rival rulers with
 the aid of an evil sorcerer brought back
 from the dead by a miraculous precious
 stone

   he does so but only after a series of hair-
 raising episodes which see him roving much
 of the globe first to learn of the stone then
 to recover it then to use it against his be-
 trayers there is considerable lusty humor
 to lighten the heavy load of super-hoboing
 and a fine inside-cover map by david kyle
 to make the weird geography understand-
 able swell stuff for a rainy night

 the green man of graypec by festus bragnell
 greenberg publisher new yorlt 

   we have often wondered what happens
 to former tennis champions when they van-

 any rate learoy spofford when he paid a
 visit to his scientist brother and gets in-
 ducted thereby into the world of the atom

 one of the most distinguished authors
 on the current american literary
 scene returns in may to an early love-
 science fiction and in the seed from
 space fletcher pratt has written a novel
 so different not only in concept but in solu-
 tion so well plotted and geared for suspense
 so ingenious in theme and humanly charac-
 terized that it may well be our novel of the
 year

   mr pratt whose writings in recent years
 when non-factual have been directed more
 toward fantasy than science fiction proper
 has here attacked a pure pseudo-scientific
 problem based on modern laboratory reality
 has followed it through to a conclusion so
 unexpected so vast and so inescapably terri-
 fying that it is going to disturb a lot of
 well-earned rest and spoil a goodly number
 of bucolic outings this summer

   along with this arresting theme mr
 pratt has come up with some of the most
 clear-cut and completely human characters
 that we have had the pleasure of meeting
 in manuscript for too many moons slater
 and angelus wright and belle and yump-
 ing yiminy and the baffled inez are going
 to be people you know very well indeed-and
 not all of them are going to be your friends

atomic space-writing

   to balance a thoroughly unusual novel we
 have come up with an equally unusual long
 novelet letters of fire by matt lee
 this is a story of a near future that finds
 earth fed to the teeth with the privations
 of ideological conflict interested not only
 in security but in entertainment-with

 what is now hollywood its most important
 center both culturally and industrially

   vidar has replaced both the cinema and
 tv as big-time show-business and the com-
 petition is terrific not to say stupendous
 and colossal result-one of the greatest of
 vidar stars comes up with atomic space-
 writing as an advertising stunt thereby
 scoring a major scoop

   actually the results are more than any-
 one bargained on for the sudden flare up
 of artificial space-writing brings earth
 heretofore considered an uncivilized border
 planet to the attention of both sides of the
 gigantic galactic cold war that has ravaged
 the star-worlds for generations

   at once agents from both sides with re-
 markable equipment seek to convey their
 cold war to earth and one of these agents
 liza a cute and utterly ruthless cookie finds
 herself with a fight on her hands before the
 inevitable happens an hilarious and in-
 genious satire the best lee story to date
