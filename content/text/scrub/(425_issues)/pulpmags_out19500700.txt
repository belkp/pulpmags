chapter i

the scarlet festival

he momen-
tous and terrify-
ing series of inci-
dents began near
the midnight cli-
max of the scarlet
festival it was
about eleven p m when i stopped
to get dianne in venta the festival
is annually held in the blue-water
grove at the edge of the city and
from diannes nearby home we went
there on foot

 my name is jac hart nothing
much of me is important to this nar-
rative i was born in great-new york

the earth and with legal status at
twenty i gained the assignment as
junior secretary to earths represen-
tative in venus of the triplanetary
union i had always liked venus its
way of life its people artistic natu-
rally gay pleasure-loving descended
from the earliest latin settlers from
earth upon this then uninhabited
planet they were softened and yet
enriched through five hundred years
here in the lush climate and beauty
that is venus and it was here in
venta that i met dianne donaldson
youngest daughter of earths present
ambassador love had ripened be-
tween us we hoped to be married
soon

 it was only a short walk from


smashers cis

timko laughed if war
comes with earth we
will have you as hostage 

        jac hart followed his kidnapped fiancee to he mystery cabins
        of a venus air-liner that enemy controlled flier was sched-
        uled to circle the second planet exactly at midnight-and
        jac learned that if the ships demon crew had their way no
        day would ever davn on that doomed world

earth-embassy to the blue-water
grove a gay holiday spirit was upon
everything the air of venus is al-
ways warmly redolent with the per-
fume of the tropic blossoms but to-
night there was a spice in it exotic
incense to stir the senses wafting
here from the festival as it drifted
on the softly stirring breeze over-
head once we get beyond the thickly
flowered embassy gardens the-venus
mist-sky gleamed with the glorious
mingled tints of the lights down in
the festival grove the colored

search-beams were rainbow fingers
moving and twining above us in the
sky

 as we walked the night breeze
stirred diannes long black cloak so
that her transparent festival robe was
suffused with the blue and red and
orange of the sky

  youre very beautiful dianne

  she laughed gaily squeezing my
arm its the spirit of the night
jac but its nice to have you say so

 now as the descending thicket
paths were converging upon the




cut of this world adventures

 grove other arrivals were visible
 ahead of us and to the sides-young
 men and laughing girls their gay
 voices mingling in a babble of antici-
 pation

  lets take a punt-boat jac
dianne suggested just the two of
us

  it was our first festival since we
 became engaged-the comparative
 isolation of a small craft would let
 us be spectators rather than partici-
 pants

  yes i agreed good idea-the
boathouse i think its off here to the
left

  we turned that way the winding
canals with tiny thicket-islands in
their loops from here were like
tangled colored threads beyond the
nearer patch of them the big central
lagoon was blood-red under the chang-
ing lights now-with little dark mov-
ing dots which were the boats upon
it to the right from one of the big
white pavilions where the crowds
were eating drinking and dancing
the soft music of an orchestra was
audible-the plaintive strings of the
native venus instruments rising and
falling with sensuous melody

at the boathouse there
seemed still to be some small
boats available i clung to the flushed
and laughing dianne trying to fend
off the plucking youths who were
pelting her with blossoms as we
pressed forward now as the mid-
night hour was approaching the fes-
tival was at its height   

   from an island pavilion just across
 from us a group of young girls came
 running their cloaks fell from them
 with long hair flying and white limbs
 flashing in the colored dimness they
 ran for the water and plunged in   
 showers of flowers tossed by the
 admiring fringe of youths came
 hurtling out from the mossy banks
 at them as they swam   

  every island thicket now held
love-making couples  we stood
watching for a moment occasionally
some of the swimming girls would
land at the dotted islands only to
be rushed upon so that with squeals
of laughter and simulated terror they
would turn and plunge back again 

  i have a punt-boat for you and
the young lady here the boathouse
attendant stood obsequiously beside
us of what size would you wish
we turned to follow him down
the jammed boathouse length the
rest-tables here were crowded with
merrymakers everyone gazing at
dianne few at me save to note me
as her protecting escort

  then as we stood at an interior
corner of the boathouse where the
clothes racks made a fairly secluded
recess dianne handed me her cloak
and hood she stood revealed her
dark hair bound on her head the filmy
pale-blue robe draped in folds about
her slim white figure with golden
ropes crossing the breart and tasseled
belt-ends dangling from her waist
she stood brushing the flower-petals
from her hair and neck while i turned
away to rack her cloak and hood in
the small row of public locks near
at hand

  you are more beautiful than them
all dianne and dont tell me its
just because i see you through the
rose glasses of a lovers illusion
thats nonsense its because-

  the words died on my lips dianne
wasnt here for that instant i stood
more puzzled than startled

  dianne- had she darted behind
some of these garments with the imp-
ish spirit of the scarlet night merry-
making upon her so that she was
hiding waiting for me to find her and
drag her forth like the maidens hid-
ing in the bosks of the islands of the
lagoon 

dianne-i see you-come out of
there but i didnt see her and
the planet-smashers



there was no answer to my calls

 the boatman came back from the
slanting apron at the waters edge
your boat is ready sirrat

 oh-thank you my companion-
she was here just a moment ago-i
cant imagine-

  his swarthy venus face carried a
faint smile respectfully he sup-
pressed it but his dark eyes under
the heavy black browns were twin-
kling could it be the little sirrata
found more attraction in someone
who seized her there is lightness
of heart tonight it means not too
much sirrat i will hold the boat
she will be back

  but we were fairly secluded here
in the recess nor would any of the
gay and laughing youths have tres-
passed upon us or if one had surely
dianne would not voluntarily have
fled with him and resisting him i
would have heard her least outcry
since i had been only a few feet
away

the boatman and i searched
the recess a little dagger of fear
now was stabbing into me i sent the
boatman away hurriedly with grow-
ing puzzlement and apprehension i
moved among the crowd out in the
open boathouse there was no sign of
her then i searched outside

  there was a small open door oval
near where dianne had been stand-
ing in the recess i went out through
it there was shrouded dimness here
with a little path and the blue
thickets crowding close and the pale
blue-white sand of the ground gleam-
ing beneath them

 dianne-

  my call unanswered floated away
then i stood startled gazing down
at a small oblong object lying here
on the ground it was diannes purse

  the sight of it as i picked it up
identified it with her familiar flowing
signature embossed upon it brought

a flood of conjectures puzzling i
knew she carried her purse strapped
under her cloak i would have as-
sumed it was there in the lock-rack
why had she removed it to carry
with her in the boat because there
was something in it too important to
be trusted in the lock-rack

  when i opened the purse there at
once i seemed to find the answer
among the litter of cosmetics there
was a sealed envelope but what
caught my attention was a small
square of stiff paper i took it out
of the unsealed envelope a flight
ticket i stared at it in the dim sheen
of the colored eave lights of the boat-
house it was a class one ticket for
tonights flight of the eq- encir-
cling the planet in  venus hours
this passenger plane traveled in a per-
petual midnight zone with each of
its stops exactly at the zero hour it
would depart from the venta air-run
at midnight half an hour or less from
now

 why had dianne planned to take
the flyer on tonights flight why
hadnt she mentioned it to me surely
it was so unlike dianne i stood
stricken yet all i could think of was
to get to the air-run and seize her
stop her if need be

 there was no time now to stand
pondering it and across the back-
ground of my consciousness there
was the frightening realization that
all my wild thoughts were implaus-
ible of her own volition going to
the flyer with her ticket in the purse
would she have dropped the purse so
carelessly and not even missed it
under what stress--or duress-she
might have been i could only shud-
deringly imagine

  within a minute now i was rush-
ing from the blue grove out by the
entrance i found a small taxi-flyer
station

  ive got to get the eq- at mid-
night i told the attendant i hadnt


out of this world adventures

realized it was so late hurry now-
dont argue about it i showed him
my identifying papers you will put
the charge to me through the tri-
planetary union ill leave your car
at the air-run you can send and get
it hurry now

  of course sirrat he hastily
wheeled out the little single seater
i jumped in and in a moment the
copters were drawing me upward

  i had risen hardly half a thousand
feet with the upper radiance of the
festival grove painting me with its
lurid sheen when suddenly from
down on the ground a pencil-beam
of stabbing vibration darted up at me
a pistol-ray trying to beam me
down i caught the source of it-
a clump of thickets off to one side
of the taxi station from which i had
risen

  the first shot missed me i swooped
with a drop and now a second one
went wild stabbing up through the
night to where only an instant be-
fore my little taxi-flyer had been
then i leveled off again and with
full power slid circling out over the
festival grove

 there was no third shot i was
alone up here in the redolent airdrift
of the languorous venus night but
now my wondering perturbation over
dianne had mounted into the reality
of terror she and i surely had been
watched and followed there in the
festival-trailed by such desperate
antagonists that openly they would
fire on me to bring me down prob-
ably kill me i had escaped them but
what of dianne

chapter ii

diabolic plot

in a moment the dwindling
splash of rainbow which was the
blue-water grove was behind me be-
yond it the lights of venta city were

a diffused patch in the haze of dark-
ness already i was dropping down
upon the air-run field the eq- in
venta takes off from its own private
departure port off to one side of the
official and public field i could see
that i was still in time the great
cylinder of gleaming silver with its
spreading banks of disc wings its
copters jet ports and propellers
and the glistening convex upper sur-
face of the glassite deck-dome stood
like an eager but quiescent monster
in its rack ready for flight

 but i had only a minute or two
to spare as i dropped the single-seater
into a public landing cubby leaped
from it and ran i ignored the check-
in portal and reached the foot of the
small ascending run at the side of
the flyer a venus fellow slim
swarthy and a head shorter than my-
self with a stiff uniform and a peaked
cap of gold denoting that he was the
eq- booking purser barred my way
no bookings now it is too late
he tried to shove me back but i
resisted im going i said per-
haps only to carolah but im going
no he said

  youre wrong warning buzzers
were sounding the faces of two or
three of the eq- crew showed at
the entrance door i shoved at the
dapper little purser get out of my
way

  special flight tonight he said
there are few passengers mostly it
is freight

  triplanetary union i said im-
portant business if you want to lose
your job- but i was in no mood
for argument in a moment i was
scuffling with him it seemed then
that somehow there was something
queer about this purser just a fleet-
ing impression and i had no time to
think of it for that moment briefly
he tried to resist me

  he was mumbling uner his breath
i thought i saw him fling a glance
the planet-smashers



up to one of the watching crew then
suddenly he yielded and i dashed on
board he came up himself a moment
later the pressure portal slid closed
after him

rjlhe silvery metal catwalk here
j- beyond the entrance portal mo-
mentarily was empty i shoved past
the few crewmen who were loitering
about they gazed but did not try
to stop me was dianne on board i
didnt see her

  now the great flyer was throbbing
as the copters lifted her in a nar-
row corridor of the cabin superstruc-
ture i gazed into several of the dimly
tubelit cabins most of them were
empty there was no sign of dianne

  on one of the narrow side decks
of the three hundred foot liner a
level below the upper dome i stood
at a bullseye port momentarily gaz-
ing out we were still rising through
the heavy almost perpetual cloud
blanket of the venus lower atmos-
phere which shrouds all the planet-
rising like an accelerating rocket as
the giant copters pulled us already
the lights of venta had dwindled to
a pinpoint and then were gone in the
mist

 we were beginning to level off
now and i could feel the banks of
propellers thrusting us and see the
flow of mist sucking around the tiered
discs of the great jutting wings suck-
ing and flowing past with our forward
movement in a great sliding ascent
we were mounting with the copters
and propellers stopping and the huge
jets coming on until in another mo-
ment we had burst upward through
the mist blanket and the purple sky
with its myriad blazing stars spread
overhead

  i turned from the catwalk deck
found an empty little cabin and sat
down with cold sweat bathing me
spewed by the agony of my indeci-
sion did i expect to come upon

dianne laughing and gay walking
or standing around somewhere here
on the flyer i knew that was idiotic
should i question the surly purser
surely he would know if she had
come aboard but there had been
something very queer about that
purser

  sitting there i found myself open-
ing diannes purse again beyond the
ticket for the eq- flight and the
cosmetics and such there was only a
small amount of money and that
sealed note envelope it was unad-
dressed a blank envelope crudely
sealed the face of it was smudged
and dirty i tore it open within was
a folded sheet closely crudely writ-
ten upon with an etch-bum pen i
gazed at it began reading and then
i sucked in my breath with my heart
pounding as i read it began

  dear lady-siratta-

  i turned to the etched scrawled
ending nameless as it finished

  so always as if should we con-
tinue to live you will know i am

 your grateful friend now in
terror

  i am no linguist my native eng-
lish so like the soft and musical
slurring of it here in venus that they
are almost the same was fully suffi-
cient to my needs

  in my teens once with my father
we spent a year or so in ferrok-
shahn the mars capital i learned a
little of the clipped and guttural mar-
tian then but not much mars and
its people never were to my liking
a totally separate race the martians
despite that they are not too dis-
similar in physical aspect-gray-
skinned angular and parched most
of them-by nature the contrast is
enormous their arrogance their
fundamental conception that each of
them is in personal alliance with the
creator-his favored child whose
ways are blessed always with right-
ness    i disliked it intensely but


out of this world adventures

i did learn a little of the martian
tongue

  this scrawled note to dianne i
found now to be a curious mixture
of english venusian and martian
and it was illiterate as well i de-
ciphered it with its horrifying im-
port sinking into me as i read but
i can give it here only in english
the sense of it and perhaps the vague
feeling of its earnest terror

  dear lady-sirrata-there was a
time when maybe it is you do re-
member not but dear lady-sirrata
you and your father was very kind
to this poor wretch who then as al-
ways was greatly in trouble espe-
cially you sirrata and never will i
that forget i am just in my blood
a poor martian with all his days most
of them were spent in the prison at
ferrok-shahn now because your
dear father made it so happy i have
been here in venus as a free man and
a little work to do which sometimes
i do so really i am martian but in
feeling i am for venus and for of
course venuss always ally and
friend the earth

  now there is something terrible
which i have learned because i am
a martian and i listen much to what
i hear around me a thing terrible
sirrata so i tell to you for your
father at once to do something to fix
it or surely now we all die  

  i went cold as i read it-a plot
by mars to destroy the planet of
venus always the earth and venus
had been a two-to-one alliance against
mars it had been indeed the only
thing which had held back the mar-
tian ambition for war we had always
known that of course a little smug
and secure yet not too much so mar-
tians could not colonize venus any
more than they could infiltrate the
earth everywhere they were dis-
liked no chance for them ever to
make an ally of venus so that now
they would destroy itij

grim and ghastly plot a thing
gigantic the future of three
worlds yet here it was reduced to
the essence of its diabolic simplicity
lying here in my lap concentrating
here in the eq- as we sped forward
in the starlight the life or death of
a great world with fate thrusting its
destiny now into my hands-fate
thrusting dianne and me so suddenly
into the core of it

  this crew on board the eq- to-
night were martian spies not venus-
men it was the climax of the plot
which for months perhaps years had
been maturing with all the grim and
gruesome efficiency of martian tradi-
tion

  in each of the leading equatorial
cities of venus atomic bombs already
had been placed a ring of them
around the equator-bombs of in-
conceivable power the result of these
many hundreds of years of atomic
fission since its original portentous
discovery on earth they were bombs
adjusted with directional charges so
that their entire force would be di-
rected downward at the core of the
planet firing simulanteously the
world-girdling series of atomic dag-
ger thrusts would split the planet in
two shatter it to bits destroy it
utterly

  already a dozen of the ibombs were
in place-the frightened note said-
hidden in the various cities along the
route of the eq- bombs which
lacked only detonators with the di-
rectional charge to set them off and
the detonators were on board the
eq- on this flight tonight it was
necessary to place them in the bombs
at the last moment since the charge
of unstable material in the detonators
could not remain potent longer than
twenty-five hours a dozen such
detonators with directional charges
were hidden here now in charge of
this brigand crew and at each stop a
martian agent would come aboard
the planet-smashers



taking one off to his hidden bomb
to be set for one hour after this flight
was over

  grim and terrible voyage this
nights momentous flight of the fa-
mous eq-

  i sat staring at my shaking hands
holding the scrawled little note of
the terrified martian renegade with
my heart pounding and the sweat
pouring out on me had dianne read
the letter it did not seem possible
for of course she would have taken
it to her father and sent for me-
we would never have gone to the
scarlet festival at all and the letter
was sealed with what obviously was
its original seal

  i could envisage now what must
have happened    the illiterate
frightened martian stopping dianne
handing her the letter and the ticket
   perhaps in his awe of her with
only some mumbled words that he
was trying to repay her former kind-
ness and dianne without looking at
them then had shoved them into her
purse and probably forgotten all
about it    and i could imagine
what had then happened to the poor
wretch suspecting him the martian
agents had seen him with dianne   
had caught him doubtless killed him
before now    and then had gone
after dianne-and after me    but
what would they do with us

  for that moment as i thought of
it terror for diannes safety so flood-
ed me that i could think of nothing
else    had she been killed   
where was she

  i jumped to my feet in the dim
glow of the empty little cabin oi
what i was going to do i had only
the haziest idea the decision was
lifted from me there was a shadow
in the door oval behind me a little
scraping noise and as i whirled i
stood looking into the rounded ugly
black grid-muzzle of a crewmans
heat-gun

chapter iii

brigands of the airways

otand quiet earthman or
 you will die he didnt have to
admonish me with a touch of his
poised finger the stabbing pencil-ray
of heat from his gun would in a split
second bore through me with its si-
lent white-hot thrust i stood
stiffened frozen staring at him
keep your hands out he said

  i spread my arms he was a slim
but muscular looking fellow clad in
the knitted gray jacket and wide trou-
sers of the crewman uniform with
the peaked cap pulled low over his
forehead a martian not so much
obvious in the english of his speech
-the martians are all good linguists
but here in the close range of the
cabin light i could not miss the look
of his wide thin shoulders his head
thrust forward on its thin neck and
the cosmetic flush covering the
parched and grayish skin of his face
to simulate the swarthiness of a
venusian

  i have no weapon i said a
peaceful passenger here why should
i need a weapon what is the mean-
ing of this

  his thin wide mouth twitched with
a faint ironic smile of course you
know nothing do you think i am a
gullible fool he came cautiously
forward with leveled weapon and
with his left hand skillfully search-
ing me did i dare risk his shot by
jumping him i was tense with the
thought but he was too alert i did
not dare try it

  very good he said stand over
there whats your name

  jac hart the triplanetary union
now look here-

  he was unimpressed suppose you
tell me what youre doing on this
flight he said

i told you-a passenger tri-


out of this world adventures

planetary business certainly not
yours im going to carolah-

  stop lying there was a girl-
my heart leaped had they indeed
killed dianne i tried to steady my-
self there is a girl i said dianne
donaldson look here what all this
means i dont know i-

  you lie

  i was with the girl at the festi-
val i-i thought she was taking this
voyage-

  she is he said suddenly i had
to believe him with so great a sweep
of relief that momentarily i stood
weak and shaking

  shes here

  yes but she will not talk-or else
in truth she knows nothing
nothing of what

  he did not answer me his dark
gaze had flicked to the chair where
i had been sitting diannes purse
was there and the scrawled note lay
beside it still with his gun warily
upon me so that i did not dare move
he glanced at the note then he was
back facing me

  now we can talk more to the pur-
pose he said grimly you read that
letter

  yes

  it was in the girls purse had
she read it

  i dont know i dont think so
and so you know what this night
will bring he chuckled grimly
well much good it will do you the
end of you of all this rotten world-
and you also i retorted you
and the rest of your murderous
brigands-

  his smile broadened it might be
worth it but not necessary when
this voyage is finished and we are
back in venta again-there will be an
hour before the bombs go off-an
hour for us to hurl ourselves away
by rocket have no fear we will
return to ferrok-shahn for the
plaudits of the people a few of us

will be left in the different cities
here along the route of course noble
suicides and they love the idea but
not me

  whats your name

  marok

  he seemed relieved his first tense-
ness leaving him they had feared
of course that dianne or i had been
able to warn tke venta officials of the
plot marok now seemed satisfied that
we had not with the tenseness of
this desperate venture upon him-
and aided perhaps by the carnival
spirit of this scarlet festival night
-i could see that he had had rather
freely of the baccus-wine

  he told me now that luck had been
with them so far on this voyage mar-
tian agents were in control of the lit-
tle private air-runs this brigand
crew were flying the ship the nor-
mal crowd of passengers here on
board would have been a problem yet
they could not bar too many of them
from embarking it would have
aroused suspicion perhaps investiga-
tion before the voyage was over but
this night of the festival was the one
night of the year when almost no one
wanted to travel which was why
they had selected it of course a few
passengers were on board now just
a small group of them

  we have them in the upper deck
salon under guard marok was say-
ing with his ironic grin they know
nothing of course that the end of
the world-and themselves-is so
soon upon them

  and now youre going to put me
with them i said

  he shook his head you know too
much why should we throw them
into hysteria and panic no i think
i will tie you up here

  the girl dianne she is with
them

 he only grinned at me now we
could feel the ships vibration again
and hear the throb of the propellers
the planet-smashers



and copters as we sped along

 carolah marok said were
dropping down a brief stop earth-
man fortunately no passengers are
booked on or off the freight and
mail- he chuckled again i think
safely we can dispense with those of
what use really with the end of the
world so near

i saw now that at the cabin door-
way threshold he had placed
lengths of rope he had brought with
him i knew i had to stall he still
had never relaxed an instant with his
weapon could i create an oppor-
tunity for a desperate try would
the wine he had drunk perhaps have
increasing effect upon him if i waited
a little longer

  i tried to smile with what i hoped
might intrigue him carolah they
tell me the scarlet merrymakers are
very bold here in carolah and we
land almost within the grove dont
ve shall we watch while we are
here

  why not he agreed he gestured
toward the broad window port just
behind me but dont think me a
fool earthman one move and i will
drill you it might be easier than
tying you up anyway

  it is strange but a fact that in very
truth venus and the earth are in-
deed astronomical twins almost of
the same size and mass with axial
rotation of almost the same duration
it was still the midnight hour as we
dropped down upon the small private
air-run at carolah and the scarlet
festival here was at the height of its
voluptuous climax

  as the eq- settled into its rack
for its brief stay marok stood with
me at the window the grid of his gun
muzzle pressed against my side the
glow of the festival lights shone upon
us a riot of color sheen in the dim
little cabin

  the air-run field in the hands of

the bandits seemed dim and neg-
lected out beyond it the festival
grove was brilliant with its shifting
rainbow glare upon a great dais
raised in the center of the lagoon
the white princess and her white
maidens stood grouped sleek and
dripping from their swim trium-
phantly enthroned but now at mid-
night as we watched the scarlet
princess and her girls were just
emerging from the pool the battle
of the vine-ropes and the flowers was
beginning   

  maroks chuckle was appreciative
you are right they do it nicely
here in carolah

  and the scarlet princess would
win of course that was traditional
but my attention was hardly on it
in a moment here at the dim air-run
the cloaked figure of a man came dart-
ing two of the pirate crewmen met
him at the boarding incline handing
him a small black cylindrical pack-
age a foot or so in length the mar-
tian agent in carolah receiving the
detonator with its directional charge
ghastly little trigger to be placed now
in his hidden bomb here

  i stood watching him as he took it
and darted away perhaps that mes-
senger still might not be figuring he
need be a suicide-he still could get
back with local transportation to
venta and join the escaping rocket
ship

  curiously irrelevant thought of
what difference to me to all of
venus one bomb at least would in
a few moments now be equipped and
ready securely hidden inevitably
detonating an hour after the end of
this voyage all i could do was stand
here helpless futile afraid to move
because a heat-gun muzzle was press-
ing my ribs

now the eq- was swiftly ris-
ing again with the festival
dropping away marok turned from


out of this world adventures

the window he sighed very nice
you were right earthman too bad
we leave yet in an hour we will see
it again in mizrah wont we

  such pleasant sights of gay revelry
to stir the primitive senses could
never be seen in ferrok-shahn they
were too incongruous to the busy me-
chanical efficiency of mars and this
was to be the last festival of the
doomed venus perhaps marok was
thinking regretfully of that he
stood behind me sighing again

 look i said suddenly why
marok how queer-

  it brought him back to the window
intent as i excitedly pointed in a
desperate effort to distract him and
as though fate were intervening to
help me at that instant the eq-
gave a sharp lurch-perhaps to avoid
some private craft dangerously in our
path of ascent as its pilot gazed down
with his glasses upon the festival
maroks movement toward the win-
dow and the lurch momentarily
knocked him against me his grid-
muzzle for that second wavered aside

  it was enough i tensed shifted
caught his hand holding the gun at
its wrist

 why-you-you- he ripped out
a martian oath as we struggled the
gun fired its split-second charge
missing me so that it hit the white-
metal cabin wall with a low splutter-
ing shower of sparks radiating back
upon us as we fought he was a wiry
strong fellow he tried to turn the
gun inward upon me then i had
wrested it from his hand but his fist
caught my face with a blow that
snapped my head back and whirled
my senses

  then i knew that i was falling
still clutching the gun but dizzily
falling with him sprawled on top of
me

  so you want to die now earth-
man

  his blow knocked the gun to the

floor beside us as i squirmed and
threshed i felt the lump of it under
me against my back he had me by
the throat now strangling with all
the power of his steel-like fingers
my ears were roaring all the dim and
turgid cabin scene was fading into
bursting showers of silent lights   

  dianne    dianne    it was
as though i wanted my murmuring
lips to carry her name while my
senses faded into the last abyss of
death    and with it like the far-
away fragment of a dream of some-
one else i seemed to know that i
had a cold and sweating hand fum-
bling under me for the gun then
my fingers had gripped it drawn it
out marok gave a cry as he saw the
gun his hands left my throat but he
was too late with what seemed my
last despairing strength my shaking
finger pressed the trigger and the
violet hiss spat and burned into his
chest drilling through his heart

  for a time i lay gasping pinned
by the weight of the dead slumped
martian but in a moment my head
cleared i slid maroks body off me
and staggered to my feet the cabin
door-oval was still open the fight
fortunately must have been unheard
no one was coming in the glowing
outer corridor i shifted the door
panel closed there was a lock i
locked it

  what i could do now seemed clear
to me certainly it was the only thing
i could plan marok and i were about
of a size i discarded my outer cloth-
ing stripped the body and arrayed
myself in the crewman garb with
the peaked cap pulled low as marok
had worn it probably i could pass
for him if i could keep in the dim-
ness and at long range

  there was a cabin cubby closet
here i shoved the body into it with
my clothes and the ropes which were
here on the floor in a moment i was
slouching out into the corridor down
the planet-smashers



at an angle of its further end one
of the brigands was standing i tried
to turn another way into a cross cor-
ridor here but he had seen me his
hand went up he called

  you marok is it all right the
chief was coming to attend to it the
carolah landing kept him busy

  i steadied my voice with my heart
racing would my voice pass muster

  no need i said tell him that
the fool earthman knows nothing i
have disposed of him

  the fellow at the corridor end
chuckled and i moved away ducking
into an ascending catwalk that led
up to the dome-deck already the
eq- was up in the starlight speed-
ing on its way through the glassite
dome the starlight filtered down up
here the little open deck was dim
save for the starlight and the glow
of lights in the window ports of the
control room forward which sat like
a little cube wedged into the narrow-
ing deck of the bow the smaller
radio room was behind it with win-
dows that were dark

 i was moving forward with
maroks heat-gun in my hand close
beside the racks of escape emergency
equipment-chutes and oxygen hel-
mets and the apparatus for fire-fight-
ing i had no warning only a vague
sound that made me see the dim shape
of a black-cloaked figure lurking in
the shadows of a rack-a figure which
all in that same second flung itself
upon me

chapter iv

girl prisoner

i must recount now what had been
happening to dianne in substance
as she afterward told it to me i was
quite right in my conjectures about
her meeting with the martian rene-
gade she had hardly recognized him
when tonight just before i had come

to take her to the festival the fel-
low had accosted her in the embassy
gardens ragged whining sniveling
and reeking of the baccus-wine which
had been his lifelong undoing

  as i had envisaged she had shoved
his gifts into her purse ignoring his
mumble of a flyer ticket thinking
idly that his mind was wandering
with drink as he babbled of terror
and the purloined ticket if it was
needed to help and this thing of great
urgency-she had hurried to meet me
and had forgotten the incident

  like mine diannes mind had held
no least presage of evil as we gaily
stood in the boathouse clothes-recess
and she had cast off her cloak reveal-
ing her beauty to me my admiring
gaze flushing her cheeks she took
her purse from the cloak stuffing its
flat oblong under her belt-thong with
the thought that she very well might
need her cosmetics

  i turned away dianne was brush-
ing off the flower petals with which
she had been pelted as we arrived the
little side door-oval of the recess was
near her suddenly without warning
from the rack of hanging garments at
her side the dark-robed figure of a
man appeared his hand gripped her
his other hand went over her mouth
stifling her outcry

  his voice was hardly more than a
whisper low menacing quiet you
will not be hurt-

 now he was shoving her back
through the hanging garments
dianne was able to struggle a little
but there were other hands clutching
her now then they had her outside
holding her as with her puny strength
she tried to fight them

 here marok the chloroform
shut her up you fool do you want
to bring all the place on us

  it was a muttered admonition part-
ly in english partly in the language
of ferrok-shahn which because her
father was earths ambassador to


out of this world adventures

mars in former years dianne knew
well

  silence her here let me hold
her

  diannes purse as she writhed and
twisted in the grip of her captors was
knocked from her belt lying unheed-
ed on the ground then someone held
the sponge of chloroform against her
nose its sickening sweet volatile
vapor wafted her senses away

she did not quite lose conscious-
ness there was the dim knowl-
edge that she was shrouded in a cloak
and hood being hurried away    the
feeling of a conveyance rocking and
bumping    the whir of copters of
a small flyer    then somehow she
realized as she was set on her feet
and told to walk and mechanically did
so that she was in a dim little air-
run    then being carried up an in-
cline and into the glowing interior of
a great flyer

  her senses wafted off again  at
last vaguely with the realization that
time had passed dianne felt herself
stirring she was lying on cushions on
the floor of a cabin dimly tubelit a
faint throb of vibration was dis-
tantly dimly audible and she knew
that the aircraft was in flight at the
door of the cabin a crewman-burly
fellow in knitted jacket and panta-
loon trousers stood lounging on
guard

  and there was a man sitting beside
her here on the floor watching her-
a slim swarthy fellow dapper with
his stiff uniform and the peaked gold
cap of a purser

  so the sirrata recovers he said
softly dont be frightened my dear
i have been waiting for your senses
to come my name is timko-i am in
charge here

 what-what happened dianne
struggled dizzily to sit up with his
solicitous hand steadying her help-
ing her up

  the chloroform he said it will
pass in a moment more

  in diannes confused mind there
had been a first thought of relief she
could remember being seized brought
here was this her rescuer but in
the same instant she knew it was noth-
ing like that    the faint irony in
this pursers voice    and the burly
guard leering down at them a heat-
gun in his hand

 what do you want dianne de-
manded how dare you-this out-
rage-

 the fellow timko dropped his
bantering manner where is your
purse he demanded grimly

 my purse why-why- then
she stammered the truth she could
remember having it-had she dropped
it there by the boathouse

  there was a letter in it timko
said a wine-soaked traitor learned
something didnt he he talked with
you didnt he hand you a letter-
about what he had learned maybe
handed me a letter yes i re-
member that dianne was puzzled

 and you told your father or
that young earthman

  i-i havent read the letter yet
why should i is it-important
he laughed softly he seemed re-
lieved and as he questioned her fur-
ther with her startled wonderment
so obvious he believed her

  then at last he stood up stay
where you are he said you will
not be harmed he laughed again
the beautiful daughter of earths
ambassador-when venus is gone and
if war then should come with the
earth-we will have you in ferrok-
shahn handy as a hostage

  to the puzzled dianne his words
were as incomprehensible almost as
though he had been talking in the
language of distant plutos fabled in-
habitants but she could not miss that
this was all something of tremendous
and terrible import
the planet-smashers

 

  i dont understand you she said
the death of-

 im glad that you do not he
grinned it would have been very
bad-had you told your father he
turned to the guard at the doorway
she knows nothing zelo we can
thank the star-belt for that no need
of putting her with the passengers
ill leave her here with you guard
her well

  of course of course tor-timko
trust me for that

rphe burly guard closed the
cabin door as timko left then
for a moment he stood gazing at the
beauty of his prisoner he came and
sat down on a little stool drawing it
up beside dianne his gray martian
face swarthy with the cosmetic dis-
guise carried an admiring ingratiat-
ing smile

  and he leaves me here to guard
you perhaps for all this last great
voyage of the eq- what a pleasure
for me sirrata

  diannes heart seemed jumping in
her throat but she managed a smile
thanks she said so were on the
eq- are we

  between venta and carolah he
gestured toward the window port
with its starlight outside at caro-
lah-why should we not watch the
scarlet festival together

  why not she agreed

  like almost everyone this night he
had had his baccus-wine the smell
of it was on him and its blur was in
his voice and flushing his face as his
greedy eyes roved over her

 you were in the festival at
venta he suggested

  yes she said

 and more beautiful than them
all he shifted toward her but she
slid back a little we could be
friends sirrata i am not quite what
i seem not just a poor venus crew-
man and you of all prisoners here

only you will live to remember it
how nice she retorted gaily
should we not drink to that my
friend zelo

 as she hoped promptly he pro-
duced his flagon of alcoholite he of-
fered it to her

  you first she said perhaps even
it might injure me with the chloro-
form fumes still in me i had not
thought of that but you go ahead i
can drink to you in spirit even if not
in the spirits of the brew

  the sodden fellow laughed gustily
as he drank ho ho the little lady
is clever

  some of the baccus brews are very
potent perhaps this one was or per-
haps already he had imbibed too
freely a clever beautiful woman can
add to anyones intoxication dianne
was plying him with the drink and
he hardly realized it time was pass-
ing she could not guess how much
there was in her mind only the
urgency of getting out of here to
escape somehow from the ship when
it landed at carolah

  i was the white princess once
dianne was saying another draught
-everyone drinks to a white prin-
cess it is tradition

  and to the scarlet princess he
laughed two drinks-to the scar-
let princess-and to you-

  and to me

  he lurched on the stool the bottle
in his hand was empty for a moment
she sat watching him silently as he
swayed with his eyelids wavering

  if you would lie down she said
soothingly i could awaken you to
see the festival at carolah

 he mumbled agreement and he
stretched himself down almost in a
moment he was stentoriously breath-
ing with the stupor of drunken ob-
livion

  the black cloak and hood in which
dianne had been brought here lay
discarded in a corner of the cabin she


out of this world adventures

flung it around her zelos smallish
heat-gun lay on the floor beside him
though she was not quite sure how
to fire it she dropped it into a pocket
of the cloak a thin-bladed dagger
was in a sheath at the martians belt
she removed the sheath clipped it to
the tasseled golden cord at her
waist

  the padded tubelit corridor out-
side the door momentarily was empty
as she cautiously peered then she
stepped out pulling the door-slide
closed after her

chapter v

room of racked death

disguised as marok i had
stuffed the martians body into
that cabin closet and gone to the
dome-deck the eq- now was well
past carolah heading for mizrah i
had little warning when in the star-
light up here that black-cloaked fig-
ure leaped upon me i did not press
the trigger of my heat-gun-all my
life i will thank providence for that
i would have done it in another sec-
ond but a low voice was gasping

  jac jac-

 it was dianne she had escaped
from her drunken guard as i have
described we crouched in a
shadowed recess of the dome-deck
swiftly whispering telling each other
what had happened there wasnt
much that i had to tell dianne

  before the ship had reached caro-
lah she had been able to hide within
hearing of a group of the martian
crew they were talking in martian
but she could understand it well she
was aware of the full plot now and
that i was a captive on board more
than anything she wanted to find me
try and get me loose from my enemy
guard

 she had located the room where
the detonators were racked-a cage-

like division at the stern of the big
open space in the lower hull which
was the mechanism room dianne
crouched on an overhead metal cat-
walk with the mechanism room
spread beneath her the great jet-
engines throbbing with their murmur-
ing hiss

  i could see the detonators down
through the ceiling bars of the cage-
room she was telling me now

  small cylinders at carolah i saw
the martian agent taking one away
so did i

 oh jac if only i could have
stopped him i couldnt get near the
exit port small cylinders yes
cylinders in racks-a dozen of them
lethal room the fate of a world
was in that cage-roora and one of
the diabolic cylinders already had
been taken to its bomb

  dianne we might get down there
now i suggested

  we might i did get in there my-
self-just for a moment before we
arrived at carolah

  there was a small side entrance to
the cage off a lower runway at the
very bottom of the hull dianne had
gotten down there

  jac i was in the cage i didnt
know wha to do i tried to examine
them-i had to duck away a guard
was coming he didnt see me in the
dark runway he took one of the
cylinders-

 the one that was taken off at
carolah

  yes i couldnt stop him-
dianne if i could smash those
detonators-you can lead me-

  all right i-i want to show you
-what i tried-i thought-

  her agitated whispers died one of
the brigand crew was coming this
way dianne was in deep shadow but
i realized that a little stray glow of
starlight was on me

  he saw me who is that he de-
manded sharply
the planet-smashers



  perhaps i could have drilled him
then but someone in the control room
might see it i stood erect

  marok i said i dropped some-
thing here but i have found it
you marok things go nicely for
us dont they we pass mizrah soon
he sauntered away along the deck
until his figure disappeared down an
incline

dianne was up beside me now
the starlight was a glow on her
white terrified face in the shrouding
folds of the black hood we stood a
moment watching our chance then
we moved like shadows along the
inner face of the glassite pressure
wall

  here dianne murmured i came
up through here

  it was a small spiral staircase lead-
ing vertically downward through the
three levels into the lower hull heat-
gun in hand i went first with dianne
close behind me there were small
windows at the different levels at
the bottom of the stairwell we
emerged upon a rather narrow grid-
landing

  there was a window here and a
door-oval opposite it at the threshold
of which we stood gazing down upon
the glowing eerie lights of the mech-
anism room four or five of the crew
were there moving around the great
engines from here a descending lad-
der went sharply down and there was
also a bridgelike catwalk at our
level spanning the overhead length of
the room

  at my elbow dianne was whisper-
ing at the other end of the cat-
walk a ladder goes down we can get
into the cage-room from there i want
to show you what i-

  suddenly footsteps were sounding
directly above us someone was com-
ing down the spiral staircase we
scurried across the catwalk with the
feeling that every instant one of the

crewmen at the engines might look
up and see us then we were across
and down the other ladder in a nar-
row corridor with the hull wall on
one side and the bars of the cage-room
on the other

  it was a feast of tantalus there
were the rows of racked cylinders
so close with only the bars between
me and them surely if i could be
in there for only a moment with
some heavy implement that might be
lying around there i could smash
them

  dianne was gesturing theres a
small entrance at the end of the pas-
sage here

  i gripped her dianne when i go
in youll hide out here- the noise
of smashing them would bring the
martians upon me of course perhaps
for a shot or two i could fight but
that would be all my tensely whis-
pered words were like a farewell if
-if a fight starts you run go back
to that drunken guard they said
theyd take you to ferrok-shahn
dont try to fight them just to be
killed-

  oh jac-

  i shoved her into a tiny recess
where another ladder went upward
she crouched down trying to mur-
mur a protest

  do as i tell you dianne

  i had started along the passage
when abruptly i realized it was too
late the jet engines had stopped the
propellers and copters were whirl-
ing we were landing at mizrah and
figures were visible now at the end
of the passage directly ahead of me
one of them was carrying the cylin-
der for mizrah he went up an in-
cline but the others stayed loiter-
ing

  i darted back to dianne with a new
idea if we could get off the ship with-
out being seen and escape safely from
the mizrah air-run which i knew was
guarded by martian agents then i


out of this world adventures

could report this bandit voyage to the
air-police the eq- would be seized
at its next stop or if not certainly
hunted down and destroyed

rphere was very little time we
went up a ladder and from a
corridor window on the level above
where cabin doors stood in a row
already we could see that the city of
mizrah was close under the dropping
ship the dark air-run was visible
and beside it the rainbow radiance of
the scarlet festival just reaching its
excitingly brilliant climax here now
at midnight

  like scurrying frightened rats we
tried to avoid being seen several
times at intersecting passages by
seconds we avoided a head-on encoun-
ter i was more desperate than ever
now with the realization that if we
did not leave the ship at mizrah in-
evitably we would be seen trapped
with a fight starting perhaps which
could only end in our deaths

  but we had no chance to get away
the ship was in its rack at the mizrah
air-run in a moment more and we
huddled together by a ventilator
hood at the lower level gazing at the
landing door with the packaged cylin-
der being carried out and the gold-
capped timko and half a dozen of his
men loitering around we were close
enough to hear them talking no pas-
sengers unfortunately were booked
to leave at mizrah nor to come
aboard our stop would be unfortu-
nately brief

  baffled dianne and i could only
stand gazing out at one of the win-
dow-ports outside the cloaked mar-
tian agent was receiving his cylinder
he was hardly a hundred feet from
us dianne had taken a tiny photo-
snapper to the venta festival she
had it in her hand now

  i snapped the one at carolah she
murmured

  she may have gotten a fair picture

of this one with the last despairing
possibility that if we could emerge
safely from this grim voyage at
venta during that last hour the police
might hunt down some of these
agents and find the hidden bombs
before they could detonate

  the agent with his packaged death
hurried away in the dimness the
eq- was rising again

 at the window we had a brief
glimpse of the festival climax-a
great fountain here in mizrah where
the scarlet princess and her girls-
their skin stained crimson with the
betel-juice-were running on the
fountain rim with long hair flying
like flames and the red glare-lights on
them

  you marok ive been looking for
you

 dianne and i stood frozen in the
dimness one of the martian crew-
men was at a cross corridor only a
few feet from us he came forward
my thoughts were whirling did i
dare drill him or were others too
near

  he saw diannes black-cloaked fig-
ure with a glimpse of her face framed
by the hood why its the little sir-
rata  so you have her with you
marok his tone was amused i
thought she was with zelo

 women are quick-witted that
clod zelo is drunk dianne said con-
temptuously he is asleep in drunken
stupor with marok here i like it
much better

 the crewman laughed good i
dont blame you bring her along
marok

  bring her i echoed

 to the forward salon tor-timko
wants to see you

 in the cross corridor two other
martians hailed us were coming to
join us starting with us for the salon
here in the dimness momentarily i
could get away with my masquerade

 but now we were trapped

chapter vi

the fight on the dome-deck

e passed the second level
salon where the passengers
were under guard

  we mounted to another level and
dianne had a chance to exchange a
few swift whispers with me that
time when she had listened to the
crew talking they had mentioned
marok he had arrived in venta on
the space-flyer only yesterday from
ferrok-shahn sent by the zar-tor
himself to join timko in tonights
completion of the plot so these
brigands actually had seen him only
briefly

 my only chance was to bluff it
through but at least i seemed to have
a chance the upper salon was bright-
ly lighted but empty one of the crew
was passing

  i said where is timko

  he gestured overhead the con-
trol room

  well go there i said

  the silent dome-deck already was
brightened with star gleams the
eq- had leveled off and was speed-
ing forward through the night
squeezed in the bow the control room
was a glare

  i could see the figure of timko just
turning from the banks of controls
with the ascent finished he saw me
as we approached waved us into the
radio cubby

  the little room was dim much dim-
mer than by the controls helpful i
drew maroks peaked cap lower on
my forehead as i flashed a glance at
the big radio senders it occured to
me that perhaps i could watch my
chance getting in here alone with
them for a moment to send out an
alarm call

  timko joined us one of the men
with us explained diannes presence
with me

  timko had turned to me you ques-
tioned that earthman well you did
didnt you marok

  yes i agreed

 he knew nothing you are con-
vinced of it

  i nodded beyond doubt i have
him bound and gagged leave him
there

  or perhaps take him to ferrok-
shahn timko suggested the zar
tor mentioned-if we brought back
with us anyone of importance-hos-
tages to bargain with if war with the
earth should come

  he might be useful i said a
stupid fellow have no fear that he
knew anything to tell anyone before
he came on board but he is a junior
secretary-

  i see of diplomatic importance
you mean

  yes like the sirrata here i
gazed toward dianne were taking
her to ferrok-shahn arent we

  the thin sallow face of timko un-
der his gold cap bore a leering grin
for your sake well take her
marok still grinning he waved us
away

my arm was about dianne as we
went back along the dome-deck
well hide i said theyll think
its quite all right a beautiful hostage
and her martian guard

  we sat huddled in a dark corner
back by the stern where the dome was
a peak with the great starry sky be-
yond it and the luminous jets stream-
ing like tiny tails of a hurtling comet

  as we watched the control room
presently timko went below the
routine navigator-pilot was at the
levers two of the other brigands
were lounging in there with him no
one was in the dim radio room except
the operator who sat alone now at his
instrument to answer properly any
routine call or check signal of the
eq- flight the official calls had to


out of this world adventures

be answered or at once suspicion
would be aroused

  i whispered if those two others
would leave the control room with
just the pilot there-

  i told her what i had in mind the
pilot had his back to the radio room
entrance and with the humming and
hiss of the mechanisms he might not
hear me if i crept in and drilled that
radioman

 dianne was shuddering but we
were so desperate that the death of an
adversary had come to mean little
she showed me her sheathed knife

  this in his back might be more
silent she said grimly

  presently our waiting was reward-
ed the two loungers left the control
room disappeared down the bow in-
cline our chance had come

  you wait here dianne ill try it
now

  no ill come with you if-if the
worst comes-ive got a heat-gun

  she was after me as i started for-
ward along the edge of the starry
deck but suddenly we stopped
stricken so frozen with horror that
we could only stand clutching each
other a wild shout sounded from
below then others mingled with
tramping running footsteps the tur-
moil of a spreading commotion it
seemed to be on the level under us

  oh jac-

  i could only stare at her mutely as
we pressed ourselves back against the
glassite wall the pilot at the levers
had locked them and run to the con-
trol room doorway the radioman was
on his feet both of them were call-
ing startled questions at each other
as all in those few seconds the silent
interior of the eq- was a chaos of
shouts then from the narrow cabin
deck almost under us one of the
shouting martian voices came clear

  marok is dead murdered by the
earthman marok is dead

  they had found maroks body there

in the cabin closet maroks body
with my clothes piled there

  i shoved at dianne we ran tried
to duck down behind one of the venti-
lator hoods it was too late the pilot
saw us he shouted

  here they are still up here at the
stern

fugitives now to be hunted
down and killed the radioman
was shouting and he fired a heat-stab
at us as we ducked-its violet pencil-
beam hissed over us hitting the venti-
lator hood with a puff of sparks now
timkos voice was added to the shout-
ing of the underdeck at the bow
companionway figures appeared
coming up from below

 the earthman and the girl-
where are they

  at the stern careful hes armed
hes got maroks gun

  the voices all seemed forward now
dianne if we can get down into the
hull rooms down by this stern lad-
der-

  oh jac- diannes voice was a
faint gasp of terror in my own whirl-
ing thoughts there was nothing but
the desperate knowledge that we must
run try and hide or if not sell our
lives as dearly as possible another
shot from the bow crackled its sparks
beside us as we jumped for the hood-
ed top of the ladder i turned for an
instant fired two stabs at the control
room saw them strike the wall with
fountain puffs of light

  ill go first dianne

  i reached the dark narrow segment
of the deck underneath the little
stern plaza was a dim triangle beside
me

  jump dianne all clear

  she jumped the last few steps into
my arms but in that same second a
silent burly figure rose from the
gloom and flung itself on us i had
no chance to use my gun diannes

letter from
    the stars

it was just a peaceful correspondence between two
lonely shut-in strangers - but the destiny of the
universe was to depend on the answers

by a e van vogt

ear pen pal	etary periods-years i suppose you

when i first re-	would call them-in an aurigean

ceived your letter	prison does not make for a pleasant

from the interstel-	exchange of letters however life is

lar correspondence	very boring and so i finally settled

club my impulse	myself to the task of writing you

was to ignore it	your description of earth sounds

the mood of one	exciting i should like to livethere

who has spent the last seventy plan-	for a while and i have a suggestion




out of this world adventures

in this connection but i wont de-
scribe it till i have developed it fur-
ther

  you will have noticed the material
on which this letter is written it is
a highly sensitive metal very thin
very flexible and i have inclosed sev-
eral sheets of it for your use tung-
sten dipped in any strong acid makes
an excellent mark on it it is impor-
tant to me that you do write on it as
my fingers are too hot-literally-to
hold your paper without damaging it

  ill say no more just now it is
possible you will not care to corre-
spond with a convicted criminal and
therefore i shall leave the next move
up to you thank you for your letter
though you did not know its des-
tination it brought a moment of cheer
into my drab life

skander planet aurigae ii

dear pen pal your prompt re-
ply to my letter made me happy
i am sorry your doctor thought it
excited you too much and sorry also
if i have described my predicament
in such a way as to make you feel
badly i welcome your many ques-
tions and i shall try to answer them
all

  you say the international corre-
spondence club has no record of hav-
ing sent any letters to aurigae that
according to them the temperature
on the second planet of the aurigae
sun is more than  degrees fahren-
heit and that life is not known to
exist there your club is right about
the temperature and the letters we
have what your people would call a
hot climate but then we are not a
hydro-carbon form of life and find
 degrees very pleasant

  i must apologize for deceiving you
about the way your first letter was
sent to me i didnt want to frighten
you away by telling you too much at
once i could not know that you
would want to hear from me

  the truth is that i am a scientist
and along with the other members of
my race i have known for some cen-
turies that there were other inhabited
systems in the galaxy since i am
allowed to experiment in my spare
hours i amused myself in attempts
at communication i developed sev-
eral simple systems for breaking in
on galactic communication opera-
tions but it was not until i developed
a sub-space wave control that i was
able to draw your letter along with
several others which i did not an-
swer into a cold chamber

  i use the cold chamber as both a
sending and receiving center and
since you were kind enough to use
the material which i sent you it was
easy for me to locate your second
letter among the mass of mail that
accumulated at the nearest headquar-
ters of the interstellar correspondence
club

  how did i learn your language
after all it is a simple one particu-
larly the written language seems
easy i had no difficulty with it if
you are still interested in writing me
i shall be happy to continue the cor-
respondence

skander aurigae ii

dear pen pal your enthusiasm
is refreshing you say that i
failed to answer your question about
how i expected to visit earth i con-
fess i deliberately ignored the ques-
tion as my experiment had not yet
proceeded far enough i want you to
bear with me a short time longer and
then i will be able to give you the
details you are right in saying that
it would be difficult for a being who
lives at a temperature of  degrees
fahrenheit to mingle freely with the
people of earth this was never my
intention so please relieve your mind
however let us drop that subject for
the time being

  i appreciate the delicate way in
letter from the stars



which you approach the subject of my
imprisonment but it is quite unnec-
essary i performed forbidden experi-
ments upon my body in a way that
was deemed to be dangerous to the
public welfare for instance among
other things i once lowered my sur-
face temperature to  degrees
fahrenheit and so shortened the
radioactive cycle-time of my sur-
roundings this caused an unexpected
break in the normal person-to-person
energy flow in the city where i lived
and so charges were laid against me
i have thirty more years to serve it
would be pleasant to leave my body
behind and tour the universe-but as
i said ill discuss that later

  i wouldnt say that were a superior
race we have certain qualities which
apparently your people do not have
we live longer not because of any
discoveries weve made about our-
selves but because our bodies are
built of a more enduring element-i
dont know your name for it but the
atomic weight is  a radioactive
isotope of chromium-authors note
our scientific discoveries are of the
kind that would normally be made by
a race with our kind of physical
structure the fact that we can work
with temperatures of as high as-i
dont know just how to put that-has
been very helpful in the development
of the sub-space energies which are
extremely hot and require delicate
adjustments in the later stages these
adjustments can be made by machin-
ery but in the development the work
must be done by hand-i put that
word in quotes because we have no
hands in the same way that you have

 i am enclosing a photographic
plate properly cooled and chemical-
ized for your climate i wonder if
you would set it up and take a picture
of yourself all you have to do is
arrange it properly on the basis of
the laws of light-that is light travels
in straight lines so stand in front of

it-and when you are ready think
ready the picture will be auto-
matically taken

  would you do this for me if you
are interested i will also send you a
picture of myself though i must warn
you my appearance will probably
shock you

                      sincerely
                skander aurigae ii

dear pen pal just a brief note in
answer to your question it is not
necessary to put the plate into a
camera you describe this as a dark
box the plate will take the picture
when you think ready i assure
you it will not be flooded with light

skander planet aurigae

dear pen pal you say that while
you were waiting for the answer
to my last letter you showed the
photographic plate to one of the doc-
tors at the hospital-i cannot picture
what you mean by doctor or hospital
but let that pass-and he took the
problem up with government authori-
ties problem i dont understand i
thought we were having a pleasant
correspondence private and personal

  i shall certainly appreciate your
sending that picture of yourself

skander aurigae ii

dear pen pal i assure you i am
not annoyed at your action it
merely puzzled me and i am sorry
the plate has not yet been given back
to you knowing what governments
are i can imagine that it will not be
returned to you for some time so i
am taking the liberty of inclosing
another plate

  i cannot imagine why you should
have been warned against continuing
this correspondence what do they
expect me to do-eat you up at long
distance im sorry but i dont like
hydrogen in my diet

  in any event i would like your pic-


out of this world adventures

turc as a memento of our friendship
and i will send you mine as soon as
i have received yours you may keep
it or throw it away or give it to your
governmental authorities-b u t at
least i will have the knowledge that
ive given a fair exchange

           with all best wishes
              skander aurigae ii

dear pen pal your last letter was
so long in coming that i thought
you had decided to break off the cor-
respondence i was sorry to notice
that you failed to inclose the photo-
graph puzzled by your reference to
having had a relapse and cheered by
your statement that you would send
it along as soon as you felt better-
whatever that means however the
important thing is that you did write
and i respect the philosophy of your
club which asks its members not to
write of pessimistic matters we all
have our own problems which we re-
gard as overshadowing the problems
of others here i am in prison doomed
to spend the next thirty years tucked
away from the main stream of life
even the thought is hard on my rest-
less spirit though i know i have a
long life ahead of me after my re-
lease

  in spite of your friendly letter i
wont feel that you have completely
re-established contact with me until
you send me the photograph

skander aurigae ii

dear pen pal the photograph
arrived as you suggest your ap-
pearance startled me from your de-
scription i thought i had mentally
reconstructed your body it just goes
to show that words cannot really de-
scribe an object which one has never
seen

  youll notice that ive inclosed a
photograph of myself as i promised
i would chunky metallic-looking
chap am i not very different ill

wager than you expected the va-
rious races with whom we have com-
municated become wary of us when
they discover we are highly radioac-
tive and that literally we are a radio-
active form of life the only such that
we know of in the universe its been
very trying to be so isolated and as
you know i have occasionally men-
tioned that i had hopes of escaping
not only the deadly imprisonment to
which i am being subjected but also
the body which cannot escape

  perhaps youll be interested in hear-
ing how far this idea has developed
the problem involved is one of ex-
change of personalities with someone
else actually it is not really an ex-
change in the accepted meaning of the
word it is necessary to get an im-
press of both individuals of their
minds and of their thoughts as well
as their bodies since this phase is
purely mechanical it is simply a mat-
ter of taking complete photographs
and of exchanging them by complete
i mean of course every vibration
must be registered the next step is
to make sure the two photographs are
exchanged that is that each party
has somewhere near him a complete
photograph of the other it is already
too late pen pal i have set in mo-
tion the sub-space energy interflow
between the two plates so you might
as well read on as i have said it is
not exactly an exchange of person-
alities the original personality in
each individual is suppressed liter-
ally pushed back out of the conscious-
ness and the image personality from
the photographic plate replaces it

  you will take with you a complete
memory of your life on earth and i
will take along memory of my life
on aurigae simultaneously the
memory of the receiving body will be
blurrily at our disposal a part of us
will always be pushing up striving
to regain consciousness but always
lacking the strength to succeed
letter from the stars



  as soon as i grow tired of earth i
will exchange bodies in the same way
with a member of some other race
thirty years hence i will be ready
to reclaim my body and you can
then have whatever body i last hap-
pened to occupy

  this should be a very happy ar-
rangement for us both you with your
short life expectancy will have out-
lived all your contemporaries and
will have had an interesting expe-
rience i admit i expect to have the
better of the exchange-but now
enough of explanation by the time
you reach this part of the letter it
will be me reading it not you but if
any part of you is still aware so long
for now pen pal its been nice hav-
ing all those letters from you i shall
write you from time to time to let
you know how things are going with
my tour

ever yours

skander aurigae ii

ear pen pal thanks a lot for
forcing the issue for a long time
i hesitated about letting you play
such a trick on yourself you see the
government scientists analyzed the
nature of that first photographic plate
you sent me and so the final decision
was really up to me i decided that
anyone as eager as you were to put
one over should be allowed to succeed

  now i know i didnt have to feel
sorry for you your plan to conquer
earth wouldnt have gotten anywhere
but the fact that you had the idea
ends the need for sympathy

  by this time you will have realized
for yourself that a man who has been
paralyzed since birth and is subject
to heart attacks cannot expect a long
life span i am happy to tell you that
your once lonely pen pal is enjoying
himself and i am happy to sign my-
self with a name to which i expect to
become accustomed

here was no space
in the tiny cabin
for nervous pacing
 scant eight feet
separated the hall-
way entrance from
the small porthole
that showed the dull black of space


and across the distance from the
locked door on one side wall to that
on the other could have been spanned
by the young mans arms only his
eyes were free to roam the narrow
room and they were tired with end-
ess repetition

for a moment his gaze rested idly
on the porthole and he stared out-

humanity wgs dying on a shat-
tered earth-and the iast man
had to choose between the un-
known perils of a slave-life on
mors and throwing himself upon
the questionable mercy cf the
encircling beast-men




out of this world adventures

ward through the cold and the dark-
ness to the tiny point of light that
was earth but there was no conscious
recognition of what he saw his eyes
dropped back to the shelf that held
his manuscript his ink and the
purple untouched candle and it
was only as he picked up the lump of
wax with slow reluctant fingers that
he thought of the valley in the hell
world that had produced it   

the mans shoulders were bowed
under the grim weight on his
back and the alpine stock trembled
in his grasp but he fought upwards
over the last remaining feet until he
was at the top of the pass and the
wastelands were behind even then
he could not trust the weight of his
burden to his shaking hands but sank
carefully to a sitting posture until it
touched the ground and he could
ease his arms out from the straps
finding a reasonably portable gen-
erator to replace the one they could
patch no more had been a miracle
and he had no faith in a second one

  for a time he lay quietly breath-
ing in ragged gasps and staring into
the valley that was cut off completely
from the world by the surrounding
mountains except for this one nar-
row pass dirty snow straggled down
to blend with leprous distorted scrub
trees and run down to flat land and
there a few log and stone buildings
stuck up uncertainly among crum-
bling ruins to mark the last failing
outpost of the human race three cen-
turies after the cataclysm the man
grimaced and began to pull himself
to his feet

  then an answering clatter of stones
sounded from around a rock and
gram was beside him pulling him
upright and massaging his still trem-
bling shoulders with gentle hands
her seamed old face broke into a
brief flicker of perfect teeth and her
fingers were unsteady but there was

no emotionalism in her voice i saw
your smoke signal last night so ive
been waiting i guess i must have
been catching a catnap though
youve been gone a long time omega
okay

  okay gram the generators in
there and enough fluorobulbs to light
all the huts but im glad i didnt
have to stretch rations another day
i had to work my way clear to old
fairbanks to find it that wasnt
pretty they knew it was coming
hours before the stuff hit them

  umm here i figured youd be
hungry as for the bulbs- she
shrugged and pointed to the purplish
plants that grew all around a muta-
tion as deadly as the hard radiations
that had produced them ill stick to
sprayberry-wax candles they have
other uses at least peter thought so

  so gentle patient old peter was
dead and there was only an even
dozen of them now but omega was
too tired to care much about anything
except the food gram held out she
watched him wolf it down and her
face lighted faintly as she dropped
beside him

  eleven worn-out old people and
you now the last dozen poor super-
men she said with a nod toward the
valley and her voice was filled with
the same grim humor that had made
her christen him omega when his
mother committed suicide over the
rock-mangled body of his father

  but omega knew it was more than
humor in a normal world with a
decent background and half a chance
they might almost have passed for
supermen except that no such world
could have produced them that had
required an earth left wrecked by the
cataclysm from a cold and casualj
unjust universe-a world where hard
radiations made every birth a muta-
tion and where every undesirable
change was savagely purged from the
race
omega and the wolf-girl



in a way it was ironic that men
had barely avoided wrecking the
planet themselves with plutonium
the lithium chain reaction or the final
discovery of a modified solar-phoenix
bomb but somehow they had elim-
inated that danger at last and found
their triumph useless

  it had been a simple communique
from the new lunar observatory at
first they had spotted a meteor hav-
ing a paradoxically weak but impos-
sibly hot level of radiation that
indicated contra-terrene or inside-
out matter the second announce-
ment spoke guardedly of the danger
of grazing contact and fifteen min-
utes later the moon ripped apart as
electrons cancelled out positrons into
energy and left a great flood of un-
attached and destructive neutrons

  surprisingly there were survivors
of the rain of hell-fragments that fell
to the earth near the poles a few
deep and narrow valleys were only
grazed slightly and where three
contained mines or caverns to offer
some protection against the radioac-
tive dust that fell everywhere a
measure of life went on after a fash-
ion and a thousand or so survived
now three centuries had whittled
down the number and wild mutations
and a ruthless survival of the fit had
compressed a thousand generations of
evolution into one

  there was gram who might have
saved the race if her cell structure
had appeared in time like the wolves
and the rabbits that had inherited the
earth her cells had finally found the
mutation of totipotency that defied
all but the most intense concentra-
tion of radiation to burn them or
cause further mutations when a
wild new plague had wiped out her
people in another valley she had
taken the boy who was to become
omegas father a rifle and a sled
and set out through a roaring bliz-
zard to cross four hundred miles of

hell to this place now sixty years
later she could still outwork any man
in the valley except for omegas ma-
ternal uncle adam on the rare occa-
sions when he exerted himself

 for adam had specialized in pure
laziness and purer logic that seemed
to leap from isolated hints of facts
to full-blown knowledge without
effort he had slouched in when
omega was fumbling over calculus
and his eyes had lighted with sudden
interest in the books he had never
troubled to read hours later he had
been explaining and making clear the
complex mathematics which his mind
had carried beyond the wildest
dreams of the pre-chaos scientists

  but it required more than such wild
talents to separate a group of freaks
from supermen it took background
opportunity racial culture and a fu-
ture and in those things the wolves
were their superiors

sudden light flashed up from the
valley disappeared and returned
to hover beside them then the spot
wobbled erratically across the pass
and came to rest against a flat
shaded rock danced crazily and
steadied down to business below the
thin lanky hands of old eli must
have been using the big mirror on a
long board to give the microscopic
leverage that was all he needed his
talent lay in a coordination and con-
trol of nerves and muscles so nearly
perfect that he could shape and
handle the infinitesimal tools needed
to manipulate individual microorgan-
isms within the field of a microscope
now the spot of light fluttered but
its motions were clear enough to spell
out letters

 hurry need generator gram
read and chuckled sure you found
one eh let them-uh-wolf-girl
-located i

 a gamut of expressions washed
over her face giving place to sudden


out of this world adventures

determination come on omega
you can rest later here let me help
you with that pack

  why the hurry and whats all this
wolf-girl stuff about after the
short rest the pack weighed a ton
and the pass looked ten miles long
no wolf was that important whatever
it had done

  gram sloved up a little some-
thing we never meant to bother you
with-ellens baby-your cousin
grown up now must be we saw her
with a wolf pack once before when
you were away but thought shed
died later oh come on before they
start a search without shields ill tell
you some other time

  they wont start without shields
he assured her she was living with
wolves gram

  must have been and theyd start
all right tom and ed died out there
last time before you invented shields
when it comes to race preservation
theyd all rather burn than see you
go unmated will you hurry

 he hurried nobody disobeyed
gram but there was a picture of what
a wolf-girl would be in his mind and
the idea of such a mating sat heavier
on him than the pack and hed
thought the old fires of racial preser-
vation were dead

 adam met them took the pack
kicked aside one of the shaggy huge-
eared pigs and paced beside gram
without a trace-of laziness its squeals
gave the boy time to get over the
shock of that before his uncle an-
swered grams questions

  jenkins-off by himself as usual
-went to sleep at the far end early
morning a howling woke him and
there she was with a couple of wolves
he got a good look-human all right
stick in her hand time he got there
she was gone but he saw the direc-
tion reckon i know where she lairs
came in half an hour ago fagged out
soon as he told us we signaled

 umm wonder where shes been
since we saw her the other time
adam

  off somewhere studied wolves
when i was a kid-they wander all
over and with your blood so could
she lucky shes back they reached
the powerhouse and adam shut up
while eli began bolting down the
generator on a rough base and con-
necting it to the old water wheel
there was a glow on his face that
was new to omega and it was re-
flected by the faces of the rest of the
group

they were all there except for
jenkins whose green pigmenta-
tion and chromosomes that came in
triplets instead of pairs represented
the only remaining physical abnor-
mality with that had gone a whole
host of wild extrasensory talents that
made him fully aware of the unpopu-
larity they won him of the others
eli adam and simon were already
harnessed into the shields a product
of adams mathematics elis amazing
workmanship and some of omegas
ideas they made space a non-conduc-
tor of all radiation beyond a certain
energy level they also distorted
gravity slightly for some reason but
it was the only way the others could
travel in the outlands

  simon snapped the last battery in
place as it finished flash-charging
while gram made a hasty inspection
omegas worn out and i dont want
her to remember me as the one who
caught her if im to handle her so
its up to you think you can do it
adam

  i figured some on it well get
her

  good she watched them start
and turned back to her hut let the
others gaup omega but were eat-
ing and then youre going to bed   
after i tell you about ellen and the
girl
omega and the wolf-girl



  it wasnt much of a story besides
omegas father grams hitherto un-
mentioned baby daughter had sur-
vived the plague and the trip shed
grown up married simon after omega
was born and thered been a baby
coming jenkins who would know
had said that he could tell it was to
be a girl

  but some accident on the hellish
march had twisted ellens mind and
she grew up as an insanely religious
fanatic apparently the thought of
her baby marrying a cousin had been
a heinous sin in her eyes anyway
they found a wild note but they had
never been able to trace her despite
their searches

  god knows we tried grams soup
was untouched before her you never
spent years praying for just one girl-
child-one fertile girl in a world
dying of sterility omega just one
because the hard rays couldnt trap
your kind from the world anymore
my lines fertile and the baby would
have been    youre too young to
understand but the old need babies
when youre close to death you need
proof that youre physically immortal
through the race-not just soul-stuff
oblivions close and taut around you
when theres nobody left to remem-
ber    oh go to bed before i start
blubbering

  can they catch her alive he
asked as gram began drawing the
pigs-wool blankets up over him

  theyll do it somehow we made
an agreement to that either they
come back with her alive or they rot
out there

  she closed the door quietly behind
her and omega was alone to vonder
at the savage drive that had lain dor-
mant and unknown so long around
him but no thoughts could keep a
man awake after the grueling trek
hed just finished and somewhere in
the middle of the thought he blanked
out

the searchers were already in
sight when gram awakened him
two of them staggering under the
twisting gravity inside the shields
but adam apparently was able to pre-
dict the shifting force and the lead-
ing figure was steady and resolute
between the others there was a cov-
ered figure on a long pole and the
tiny clan was gathered outside the
hut in a shouting group but by the
time omega had doused his head in
water and joined them they were
silent again the three were closer
now and their faces and the pose of
their bodies could be seen even in
the gathering twilight

  they dropped their burden in the
same rigid silence and simon who
had been ellens mate and father to
the child turned motioned to his
twin sister and went off toward their
hut the others waited uncertainly
until adam bent down to pull the
blanket from the figure on the ground

 wrong word accented on wolf-
girl gram but here she is now
what and he yanked the cover from
the forlorn creature that lay bound
by its feet to the pole

  it was a wolf strange and odd of
form though she was there could be
no shadow of doubt as to her lupine
origin the teeth that gleamed
through the ropes around her jaws
were wolf fangs and the tail settled
any further question

  yet it was easy to see how jenkins
could have thought her a woman in
the dim starlight for the mutation
that had somehow produced her in
spite of her parental totipotency had
shaped her into a mockery of human
form and she was as anthropoid as
wolfish her rear legs were long and
her short front ones ended in length-
ened toes to caricature human hands
her forehead bulged and her jaw was
foreshortened while the mane on her
neck might have been mistaken for
a head of hair if she stood upright


out of this world adventures

and because she was built in a
womans shape there was something
pitiful about her as she lay glaring
up at them

  jenkins felt it first and his sigh
broke their silence he pushed for-
ward his shy fearful eyes half-filled
with tears for a second he hesitated
before his hands ripped aside the
cords that bound her mouth her lips
drew back but she made no move to
snap at him as he faced the others his
quavering timid voice filled with bit-
terness and apoiogy

  the ropes cut her lips gram her
minds all dark and swirling fog hard
to see but shes crying not for her-
self but for her babies back there
little ones like her do we have to kill
her gram

  gram shook her head to clear it and
her voice was as low as his and as
uncertain but you saw the wolf-girl
carrying a stick can we be sure    
look further into her mind

 we found the stick adam an-
swered for him shed need one with
her build couldnt run on all fours
not quite ready to go upright very
long jenkins whats her name
her name i-i cant see very
well something about hunger-pain
i think

  bad-luck called that because of
the way shes built i guess not much
of a language unless they changed it
since i was a kid bettern your
telepathy though you read off what
i think while i try her

his lips contorted out of shape
and a queer wailing whine slid
eerily out the wolf-girls head jerked
around and her eyes shot behind him
to come back reluctantly to his as he
called again at the third try her own
lips parted in an effort closed and
opened in sounds between a growl and
a whine yet somehow articulated and
hopeless perhaps the sight of a man
and a wolf-mutation talking was as

logical an ending for the day as any
other at least the little audience
watched in unchanging dull listless-
ness

  jenkins voice droned forth read-
ing the meaning from adams mind
surprised at him    not mad at us
why should she be    huntings natu-
ral  is he man or wolf    yes
shell answer his questions no never
saw any human shes outside the val-
ley  no baby shes    when are
we going to eat her

  ugh i suppose   oh let her go

i wish id never known she could
talk adambut now- gram sighed
staring about for suggestions and
finding none tell her well feed her
since we ruined her hunting and let
her go but shes to keep out of our
valley and let our stock alone i guess
thats all we can do now can you
tell her that in her language

  say it all right-theyve improved
it some but for her to understands
another thing translate the bible to
wolfish if i had to but it wouldnt
mean much to her takes semantic
training to work out much with a hun-
dred odd words though it can be
done umm he frowned consider-
ing and little jenkins again con-
scious that his gifts were unwelcome
among normal minds slipped away
quietly before adam began

  it took longer this time and there
could be no doubting the surprise and
slow dawn of hope on the creatures
face as the meaning finally sank in
she lay quietly her eyes riveted on
his as he untied her but it wasnt
until he placed a frozen leg of pork
in her oddly human hands that she
believed him then she was gone at
a jerking run

  but she stopped hesitantly as a
high wail broke from him and paused
long enough to answer his cries be-
fore her figure faded away into the
twilight he grinned crookedly at
gram and shrugged no smell of
omega and the wolf-girl



people outside that she knows of

 no gram sighed again and
pushed the door open come on in-
side adam omega the rest of you
go back to your huts theres no good
to be had from freezing out here
we had our fun but its over now
and we can forget the wolf-girl idea

  in that she was wrong it was less
than three hours later when a subdued
howl from outside drew adam up
from the table and out into the night
outlined in the dim light of the open
door bad-luck had returned and be-
side her hovered an old and grizzled
wolf with raised hackles and bared
fangs but motionless as the feared
man-beast approached

  their conversation was erratic and
uncertain with long silences but
eventually adam nodded and the
wolves melted into the darkness he
came back to the hut with a shake
of his head and a strange smile and
dropped onto the stool to watch
grams hands go on remorselessly
with her canfield

  the old wolf is their far-food-
sniffer keeps in touch with all other
packs i gather anyhow no wolf on
the whole planet knows the smell of
men except here    funny nature
seems to be cooking up replacements
for us and not wasting time came
a long way since i studied them
ethics

  gram nodded wearily and dead
dull silence settled over the hut re-
lieved only by the monotonous slap
of the cards

it was barely past noon when
simon and his sister were found
the next day deep in the catalepsy
of sprayberry poison within them
the incredibly slowed labor of breath
and heartbeat would go on for hours
longer but it was too faint to be de-
tected and their bodies were already
cool to the touch yet they could still
be revived and omega turned auto-

matically to get the neutralizing dye
adams hand stopped him

  no use boy theres always more
poison he looked around the room
once more taking in the magnificent
paintings the twins had done then
pulled the door shut behind them and
began nailing boards over it wooden
steps carried them back to the cold-
frames where gram and eli were at
work setting cabbage seedlings but
the hammering had carried the news
before them and no comments were
made

  the only sound was a distant drone
like an early swarm of bees and it
disappeared as omega dropped to the
cold earth and began replanting how
many he wondered would live to
eat the plants when they were grown
there were only ten now

  then the buzzing was back and
gram was dragging the others up to
face the sky where a roaring some-
thing grew out of emptiness flashed
over and faded away again a ship
a jet plane

  it couldnt have been and yet it
was there was no habitable land be-
low  south latitude one colony
of the original three had reported it-
self dying of famine grams had
perished in the plague and the
wolves knew of no smell of men out-
side the valley

  but they were already at the power-
house and elis hands flipped over the
switches of the crude spark-gap trans-
mitter the first survivors had built
and the current danced between the
electrodes in code so rapid it was like
a steady crackle he waited futilely
for an answer from the humming
speaker and began transmitting
again

  then the roar was back and they
had only time to look out before a
flash of metal screamed down wrig-
gled zipped up across the pass and
was gone again gram lifted her fist
the dirty spalpeens making fun-


out of this world adventures

  before she could complete the ges-
ture a young masculine voice burbled
out of the speaker hi people took
a little time to find and match your
frequency-your signal sprays all
over the kilocycles i cant understand
that greased lightning c w though
so give me three slow dots if you can
receive modulated stuff    fine
sorry i couldnt land with my fuel
reserves but ill be back meantime
take a look at the film i dropped
planet mars signing off

  mars i theyd been almost ready for
that but    and the voice had been
filled with a strange quality that in-
stinct recognized as youthful en-
thusiasms and sure self-confidence it
must be nice-

  jenkins interrupted their reverie by
laying a package on the bench that
would be the film though he alone
had seen it fail for the first time any
of them could remember elis hands
fumbled as he ripped at the junk
wound hastily -around the thing and
it was adam who finally freed the
little machine and found the light
switch he focused it carefully
against the gray stone wall located
another button and sat back to watch
the moving scenes

  they were obviously conventional
ized drawings at first but they were
clear enough a man labelled mason
stood in the port of a crude rocket
ship with his young wife while a
crowd cheered and drew back they
waved shut the port and lifted on a
jet of flames

  the earth shrank behind while the
moon slid into view and went quickly
past but mason was framed in a port-
hole just as the moon broke loose in
lancing hell-fire scenes showed his
wife trying to nurse his burned body
and frantically fighting to bring the
ship down on mars in a crumpled
landing and then furry four-armed
anthropoid things came out to take
mason and his wife down to a strange

underground and primitive world

  after that mason was their teacher
they had been dying for lack of
power but now the ships atomotors
gave them the margin they needed to
rush upwards to a self-sustaining
civilization that could even bake air
and water out of the dead crust of the
planet

  mason grew older and six girls
were born to him but careful sche-
matics showed that the moon-blast
had rendered his male sperm cells
sterile and there were no boys they
stored his superfrozen spermatozoa
and sought valiantly for a cure but
they had not succeeded when the
screen portrayed his funeral proces-
sion

  the final scene showed a glorified
statue of mason holding a book in
one hand and stretching a symbolic
atom upwards with the other below
eight young and human women were
grouped about a great rocket with
their faces turned to the sky and their
arms lifted in mute appeal then the
film ended

omega wasted no time on the
others comments the boards on
simons door came ripping off under
his straining muscles and he was in-
side and forcing black liquid down
the throats of the twins the vege-
table dye they used to color their
clothes and serve as their writing ink
had revived poisoned pigs before and
should serve equally well for men it
did the late afternoon sun saw
twelve of them again watching as the
ship settled downward on its jets a
hundred yards away

  a thin four-armed furry figure
came out to be followed by two ap-
-oarently identical others and then
while the dozen waited in tense ex-
pectancy the door closed firmly and
they headed toward the group-three
martians and no earthmeni beside
him omega heard grams breath
omega and the wolf-girl



whistle out heavily and an animal
snarl from jenkins only adam
seem unruffled and unsurprised as he
sauntered forward to grasp their lead-
ers hand and make proper introduc-
tions

  jaluirs furry face remained expres-
sionless but his voice was the warm-
ly enthusiastic one that had come over
the speaker so you really do exist
where the deuce were you last win-
ter there wasnt a sign of life that
we could see

  holed up snow gets twenty feet
deep down here-covers everything
we seal up and hibernate in the cav-
erns back there till after the spring
floods explore all non-radioactive
areas

  all seventeen this one came last
and our plane broke down for a
month or wed probably have found
you he shrugged a gesture that
must have come down from mason
after that we gave up hope until i
made a forced landing in old fair-
banks i was pretty sure someone had
been there recently and commander
hroth let us stay over another week
but it was a devil of a job locating
your campfire sites to get a fix

  why bother you didnt come just
to see us-not with people of our kind
on mars grams voice was suddenly
old tired and suspicious and the
martian blinked in surprise

  we needed some metals of course
-but we wouldnt have crossed space
yet for just that he hesitated and
his next words were fumbling and un-
certain the girls who saw us off-
we failed in spite of them-they are
the last we had only the prophets
male germs    we have taboos too
maam but-well we had to do what
we could now when our hopes were
gone the gods have given us life
again

  umm well you might mean it
you and your friends had better come
inside no use standing out here

  if its all the same id rather see
that radio transmitter of yours he
answered

   ram nodded grudging approval
and omega was glad of the excuse
to rescue him from their frozen faces
it didnt make sense when even a
martian crossed forty million miles to
pay a neighborly visit he deserved a
little warmth in his reception in-
stead gram was adopting the same
attitude with which shed greeted
adams proposal to scrap english and
switch to a fully semantic language
of his devising the boy fell into step
with the alien while the others fol-
lowed

  the transmitter held jaluirs atten-
tion for only a minute before his eyes
began traveling over the rest of the
powerhouse the crude millikan mi-
croscope adam had designed from the
fruits of omegas wanderings was in-
spected more thoroughly to be fol-
lowed by one of the little radiation
shields

  cuts off high energy radiation
adam volunteered and his eyes were
speculative in spite of his easy grin
take it along if you can use it

  the martian nodded and dropped it
into a pouch on his belt-his only
article of clothing simple after
someone else discovers the principle
thanks we certainly can use it   
we wondered how you reached fair-
banks

 gram grunted nonsense omega
and i dont need contraptions were
naturallv immune to radiations

  zot hull youre- the face that
he turned to the boy now was no
longer expressionless it held a burn-
ing excitement that no alienness could
conceal he twisted on his heel and
snapped out syllables in a strange
tongue that sent the other two mar-
tians toward their ship in a clumsy
run but when he faced them again
his emotions were under control and


out of this world adventures

his voice was quite even and friendly

  sorry but ive got to go back to
the ship for a few minutes look
lets get down to brass tacks shall
we how soon can you leave

 for mars gram asked

  for mars itll foe five hundred
years before earth is really habitable
again at least and you cant go on
in these little valleys what better
sanctuary than a grateful mars of
course youll need a little time-but
talk it over until i get back

 and he was gone after his com-
panions

gram sighed wearily and the
stiffness drained out of her body
sanctuary-or slave pen he seemed
nice enough but-

  hes a monster jenkins normal
meek whisper was distorted into a
savage hate-filled wheeze an in-
human monster his brain is blank-
all blank i cant even feel it

  adams cool voice cut into his rav-
ings take it easy if you cant snoop
in his mind you dont know what
he is and you dont hate a man for
that-or do you personally i liked
jaluir

 so did i gram admitted but
there was no lifting of the frown on
her face we would you cant catch
a wolf without something attractive
for bait and maybe he is all sweet-
ness and light the missionaries
meant to help the aztecs until they
found gold and cortes came and our
ancestors made slaves of the black
people and tried to exterminate the
jews for not being exactly like them-
selves-and mars is a lot stranger
to us than anything we found here
maybe were gods to them as he
says and maybe were animals
their doubts were growing by a
process of mutual induction until
even omegas ideas began to veer to-
ward them but his words carried no
conviction in either direction of

course we cant be sure we have only
the evidence they designed for us but
he seemed friendly

 why shouldnt he when our
planets loaded with minerals they
need were used to gravity that
makes them uncomfortable and we
can stand the radiations now he
liked that part a little too much
gram hesitated and her gaze turned
to the east where her native valley
lay we always took even better care
of our animals than ourselves i know
because we had horses when i was a
girl-until a careless fool left a gate
open and our two stallions were killed
by wolves he tried to hide the evi-
dence because he knew what wed
do to him but i saw it all and i was
young enough to carry tales poor
devil they turned him out to the
wolves eventually    men will do
strange things for beasts of burden
omega

  or for pets adam added thought-
fully vote

 but no vocal poll was needed
simon and his sister moved toward
the door and his sad dulled eyes
were quietly reproving as he looked
at omega gram turned from one to
another and at last she nodded quiet-
ly and went out toward the huts in
a moment only adam and omega
were left in the building

  jaluir found them there and the
lilting jingle on his lips broke off in
a sudden puzzled grunt adam
chuckled wryly gone took a vote
after a fashion its a lousy world
jaluir but were staying and dont
ask why because i dont know

  but you cant-youre    all of
you omega too

  thats up to him he didnt vote
rest of us stay anyhow -
oh jaluir considered it
shrugged and gave it up as a hope-
less riddle i wont pretend i can
understand but if thats the way you
really want it ill explain it to com-
omega and thewolf-girl



mander hroth somehow anyway
ive got to return to the main ship
before it gets dark so id better shove
off now but ill be back in the morn-
ing to pick you up omega

 he grasped the hand adam held
out and was gone to take off a min-
ute later in a flaming roar and go
speeding over the mountains adam
slumped against the door for a few
seconds then came in and began
quietly buckling on a radiation shield

  going up to talk with the wolf-
girl he volunteered with deliberate
casualness as he finished curiosity
if i dont get back in time to see you
off-

 who made up my mind i was
going-jaluir or you

  fate if theyre nice people you
should if not-well theyll have
weapons and ways good luck son
he slapped his nephews back lightly
grinned and went sauntering off
leaving omega alone with his
thoughts they were not good com-
pany

 but adams logic was unanswer-
able and omegas packing was done
in the morning when he awoke from
fitful slumber to see the plane already
landed and waiting beside the row of
silent boarded-up huts he had
helped gram nail them shut during
the night and he knew that only
gram and he were left besides adam
still among the wolves even little
jenkins and his queer twisted talents
grams eyes red with lack of sleep
followed his gaze

  forget them boy jenkins was al-
ways a little crazy and eli was dying
of cancer anyhow the rest were-
useless sometimes i used to wonder
about such things-the warped
strange ideas of isolated little com-
munities and the references in the
psychology books to contagious sui-
cide during times of trouble but
theres something more

  she shook her head wearily draw-

ing her hand across her forehead its
a curse a will to death that made them
sterile because they wanted to be and
made them die whenever they had an
excuse-no matter how much they re-
fused to believe it call it a mutation
that crept in unnoticed or say the
whole race gave up and went quietly
insane after the hell years they
could have built some kind of glider-
plane and kept contact between the
valleys if theyd had the spunk and
none of this would have happened
anyway theres a curse on the val-
leys    youd better go now omega
dont keep jaluir waiting too long

  there were words inside him but
they wouldnt come out gram laid
her brown old hand gently on his
mouth and the ghost of a smile ap-
peared on her lips no just go and
sometime if you have children-not
slave children omega but men-tell
them of me id like that

 the door was closed when he
looked back and the valley was
strange and oppressive jaluir mo-
tioned him to a seat beside a window
away from the huts and he sat staring
at the instrument board for what
seemed hours while the plane waited
then the jets screamed out and they
were airborne after a brief run

  below the martian said softly
and pointed

tiny but distinct against a patch of
snow a figure stood waving up at
them surrounded by dark dots that
must have been the wolves jaluir
dropped the plane and circled as close
as he could and for a moment adams
easy smile was visible then he turned
and slipped into a cave with the pack
and there was only the martians si-
lent grip on the boys shoulder and
the sound of the jets as they sped
off across the wastelands

the warmth of his hands had
softened the purple wax and he
continued on page 
the puzzle of

trapped in an underground sacrificial chamber on
a deserted planet those explorers learned that
freedom lay in the solution of a puzzle a quarter-
million years old-with lingering death
as the penalty for failure

he bravely
questing light of
hartwicks helmet
beam disclosed the
tunnel abruptly be-
coming five more as
it dipped sharply
down he halted perplexedly scratch-
ing his transparent visor with a metal-
gloved hand

  unable to stop short boule the
expeditions photographer tripped
into him cursed and cursed again as
the three scientists piled up against
his back with weirdly echoing crashes
of spacesuit against spacesuit

  careful h a r t w i c k careful
lutzmans bass voice warned into
their headsets from the rear an-
other tangle like that and well rip
the line to bhishani

  the guide nodded abstractedly at
the bioareologist he spent a long
careful glance at the faintly fluoresc-
ing cable connecting the loops in their
suits and stretching lengthily behind
them through corridor after intersect-
ing corridor to the assistant archaeol-
ogist on the surface the cable was
their link with life

from between boule and lutzman and
peered over hartwicks shoulder
we differ from theseus only in that

we use an insulated wire instead of
a spool of thread

  and that we wont find a martian
version of the bull-man monster in
the heart of this neurotic temple the
bioareologist pointed out not that i
look forward to it hed be rather
hungry after-how long

  punnello shrugged his shoulders re-
soundingly at least a quarter of a
million years since priipiirii had a
worshipper no from those wall
friezes weve been passing id say
he was arthropomorphic enough-as
crustacean as the race which con-
ceived him

  which isnt very crustacean ac-
cording to earth standards lutz-
man observed why does he continu-
ally change his sex when we dug
away the sand and stepped through
that first trapdoor on the roof there
was a large statue of him as a male in
front of the cross-passage after the
first level there were only female rep-
resentations they became hermaph-
rodite and later neuter down here
he shifts back and forth through all
four in each frieze and yet the prii-
piirii ideogram on each of his pic-
tures is unmistakable

  why for the matter isnt there
an occasional hint of the daily life of
the average mortal such as we found
in the other temples they showed
their gods being worshipped and oc-
casionally disregarded here there is
a steady reiteration of priipiirii only


-priipiirii at work and at play as it
were odd that business of play con-
sidering how evil other martians
thought him

 dont you boule asked sudden-
ly ive been snapping flash shots of
this jovial character in all his phases
and i like him less all the time i dont
know why ancient mars tabooed him
but he sure radiates the impression of
happy executioner frankly im
sorry i came on this jaunt i dont
relish wandering around in the place
where the martian devil was wor-
shipped and i still havent accepted
those trapdoors on the roof of the
temple-as if the inhabitants knew it
would be buried by the desert one
day

 hartwick paused in the middle ot

an impatient gesture at the five tun-
nels ahead of them and swept his
helmet light through the gloom until
it came to rest on boules visored face
back in bubbleburg when hed been
commissioned to lead an expedition to
the fabled temple of priipiirii the
martian archaeological foundation
had assured him that the scientists of
the party would all be picked psycho-
certined men

  but theyd said nothing about guar-
anteeing the photographers stability
the desert guide remembered uncom-
fortably boule was one of the few
lens-hounds in the archaeological
paradise that the dead planet had be-
come  hed taken pictures of the early
excavations at gulthum and yeyar-
ueh when the nrst mumbling hints of

-


out of this world adventures

the priipiirii cult had been noticed
he was a logical choice

  very possibly they suspected the
end of their canal civilization would
invite the desert to creep forward
again punnello suggested ill ad-
mit it is rare to the point of non-
existence for a race to build with a
view to its own extinction but re-
member what a highly intellectual-
ized-rather than mechanicalized-
culture the martians enjoyed they
were definitely telepathic probably
prescient too and the reason why
priipiirii frightens you so seems so
alive-

  if you dont also feel hes alive
why use the present tense

 hah the archaeologists jaw
sagged against his facepiece

  all right hartwicks voice inter-
rupted brusquely the big question
right now has nothing to do with
whether this purple crayfish has horns
or a forked tail down which of these
five holes do you professors want to
be led the slope is getting sharper
all the time so we have to be twice
as careful as a trip to mercury and
if we meet any reincarnations boule
dont forget that you lutzman and
punnello each have deadly little
kazoos in your mitts and im carry-
ing a bazooka

  i only wish you werent holding
any sort of rocket weapon boule  he
added to himself talk like that in
a place like this

  the archaeologist turned to lu
man considering the one-sided sf -
scry orientation of the architects i
think we might as well continue bear-
ing hard to the left seems correct
up to now

 left lutzman turned from a
frowning examination of a mural de-
picting priipiirii swimming twisted-
ly in a canal-the back of his thorax
and the front of his abdomen sub-
merged not necessarily if-

nphey all spun round as the hideous
-a- clatter began in their rear the
bioareologist stepped forward and
squinted up the incline that slanted
past multitudinous passageways to
the desert surface

  its bhishani he shouted must
have fallen through the trapdoor and
couldnt get to his feet in time
hartwick wasted a quick glance for
the sake of certainty at the limb-
threshing figure rolling toward them
like a compact avalanche get over
to the wall he yelled if he hits
us-

  he ran to his right dragging boule
with him while lutzman and pun-
nello scrambled to the opposite side
before either pair could correct their
error the hindu archaeologist bound-
ed into the taut cable connecting them
across the tunnel and snapped them
around him in a churning conglomera-
tion of bodies

 they bounced hurtfully through
the center corridor ricocheted against
a slanting wall and crashed agoniz-
ingly to rest upon four red idols on
the floor of a spherical room

  hartwick was on his feet first test-
ing his suit for leaks and using mus-
cle-flexes to determine if any of his
bones were broken finding nothing
he reached down and angrily turned
bhishani on his back do you realize
what youve done

  the assistant archaeologists face
sickened to blue under its smashed
visor felt a tug on the line he
gasped thinly into his headset lift-
ed trapdoor-leaned over-slipped-
not my fault-why did you tug on-
his throat rattled in the almost air-
less cold

  hey lutzman the guide snapped
at the martian biologist who was
groaning himself into an upright posi-
tion fast help me work his head-
screen over the crack in the visor
together they tugged at the round
the puzzle of priipurii



piece of metal at the top of the hel-
met the headscreen too had been
bent by the fall it was stuck tight
hartwick abruptly stopped working
on its broken hinges and tore it out
of place he fitted it rapidly around
the visor and snapped the emergency
clips into position but by the time
he saw the rip in bhishanis oxygen
tank the mans body had relaxed out
of life

  poor guy boule muttered gone
just like that

  punnello was also on his feet per-
haps-some of our oxygen-

  not a chance the guide told him
mars is too fast for you

  i cant understand how he felt a
tug on the line if any of us pulled
at it the others would have noticed
work it out tomorrow hartwick
invited meanwhile the only way we
can be sure of getting out of this
lunatic maze is by following the cable
while it still reaches to the surface
lets go

  he started for the tunnel opening
where the wire lay slack his com-
panions following

  the line was piled inside the tunnel
mouth coil upon scrambled coil

  bhishani must have torn it loose
when he fell in lutzman almost
squeaked he regained control of his
voice and the desert wind blew it
down

  hartwick nodded and kept going
its still roaring you can feel the
rattle of sand on your visor we can
find the trapdoor that way

  he stopped a moment later as the
wind disappeared trapdoor must
have been blown shut but the sand
makes a track

  the winding path of sand drifted
down casually lazily-but complete-
ly it went past them into the room
of tour idols and collected in little
piles upon the harsh stone floor
ahead of them they could see that
the tunnels were perfectly clean under

  the glare of their helmet beams

  you cant call this an accident
boule began in a high voice

  shut up i think i can remember
the turns we took we simply reverse
them going back lets keep moving
before it gets hazy

with hartwick leading they
raced up the weirdly offshoot-
ing corridors in their ungainly space
suits thei f helmet lights made the
rapidly su eessive friezes of the tem-
ples god eem like a jerky motion
picture suddenly the guide slowed
to a walk

 whats the matter punnello
gasped from the rear

  no slope its gone level and we
should still be climbing

  they came round a curve in the tun-
nel-and into the spherical room bhi-
shanis body lay near one of the idols
piles of sand   

  one by one they filed in boule
said huskily a circle

  hartwick rang a fist against his
open metal palm look he said at
last maybe im hearing the sutter
of bat wings in my bell tower but i
have the odd idea that the maze was
rearranged

 obviously punnello nodded
the gradient which was present
everywhere when we came down has
disappeared but i suggest-and for
other reasons than because that way
madness lies-that we temporarily
gloss over that explanation of our
failure to escape-er to reach the
trapdoor i suggest we concentrate
on things like routes

  it does seem- the bioareologist
cleared his throat no

  boule walked over to the four idols
and examined the table at which they
sat saea theyre playing a game
of saea saea

  hartwick having observed him re-
move his kazoo from its holster un-
slung his bazooka cautiously know


out of this world adventures

  anything about saea docs he asked
his eyes on the photographer does
it help

 not very much punnello said
slowly as he too looked down at the
odd altar directions for play have
been deciphered in every martian
ruin but its a little too rich for our
ccrebral blood the rules are a cross
between chess and the japanese game
of go with the addition of crevices
where pieces can be held out of play
for a varying number of moves why
a sculptured problem in saea now

 lutzman moved up and do you
notice who the players are our old
friend priipiirii-all four of him
he swept an arm around at each enor-
mous scarlet idol masculine femi-
nine hermaphrodite neuter

  reds the martian color of death
isnt it the guide inquired

 punnello nodded abstractedly
and life in fact the combination
cf the two expresses it better here
perhaps- suppose we work cn less
metaphysical subjects much safer
at the moment

  they agreed rather hastily hart-
wick drew a stylus and a sheet of
recordio film from his flank canister
the four of them squatted on the floor
near the body of the assistant archae-
ologist and discussed the matter of
routes they argued about each turn
they had taken until they were all
convinced of each one the guide
copied the list backwards in the or-
der which they would come across
the intersections while returning
then they left the room again care-
fully reversing each change of direc-
tion

  fifteen minutes later they were
back they discussed the list made
a few alterations and once more left
through the tunnel in which the cable
was piled

 the sixth time they came back
hartwick scaled the sheet of recordio
out into one of the tunnels it spun

  away drifted easily back and floated
to the floor

  one last idea he said this has
to work

 whats the use boule demand-
ed lets admit what were all think-
ing and really get someplace

  hartwick tightened his grip on the
bazooka i dont know he said with
a grim attempt at humor are we all
thinking

 the archaeologist shrugged we
start with the premise that we are the
first humans in this temple and that
no humans on mars have any desire
to do us harm

  check the guide told him softly
just carry that ball doc

 we accept though on less evi-
dence that there are no extra-solar
creatures operating here since there
was no indication of this site being
disturbed and no one has previously
observed such creatures in the sys-
tem furthermore there is no race in
the system other than humanity
which possesses intelligence finally
for almost a hundred thousand years
the only animal life which has existed
on mars is the extremely primitive
polar beetle therefore the tugging
at the line the death of bhishani the
loss of the wire path to the surface
all of our difficulties-including the
apparent rearrangement of the laby-
rinth-may be laid to mechanical con-
trivances which the temples builders
left behind them out of viciousness or
religion

  such contrivances are not rare in
terrestrial temples especially of this
type however we have the fact that
martians tended more to things in-
tellectual-the esthetic and philo-
sophical say-than to material enter-
prise all that we have seen on mars
supports this view it would seem to
be accentuated among this particular
people where with the exception of
the trapdoors not one remotely me-
chanical device has been observed
the puzzle or priiplfrl



and if you add the almost sentient
malevolence with which we have been
frustrated logic leaves only-

  only what

  priipiirii lutzman finished very
gently for the archaeologist priipii-
rii and evil deity

  well ill be- ive been sitting on
that notion like crazy but i never
thought a bunch of scientists could
swallow it

 reject the implausible pun-
nello intoned as if the words were
a hymn and what is left is the plaus-
ible

  its true isnt it the photogra-
pher demanded you feel hes alive
hes near us dont you

hartwick looked from one hel-
meted face to the other his beam
stabbing three separate times around
their heads to the curved walls then
he sat down

  all right ill admit i believe it
but why should i

  well the archaeologist sank his
head on his chest and minced a tiny
meditative circle it has been sug-
gested that the powers ascribed to
some of the terrestrial deities really
existed at one time or another in
some form or another that the very
act of widespread belief in a particu-
lar god called forth something like
that god with some of his powers on a
temporary basis now generally this
theory may well be grit for the herds
but here where you have a race in-
tellectualized out of all human con-
ception that had achieved a philo-
sophical level higher than the scien-
tific one we may reach in a thousand
years a race that had telepathy pos-
sibly prescience of a sort and various
mental facets outside the scope of our
imagination-such a race might well
create a living god from its collec-
tive mind a sort of racial super-id

  but why would they need a god
with all that mental equipment i

just cant see them praying exactly

  prayer and sacrifice and the grant-
ing of favors thereby is only one of
the uses of a divinity he can fill cer-
tain psychological needs which the
race may even recognize as such for
example the warlike inhabitants of
asgard rarely gave boons to suffer-
ing norsemen they carried on a con-
stant heaven-shattering warfare how-
ever in the last great battle of which
humanity was merely an inconsequen-
tial ally they typified the precarious
bloody existence of the race which
had conceived them they were satis-
factory

  i see that but how did we get
priipiirii into the psychic flesh
again

  by thinking about him by believ-
ing in him those wall friezes were
probably not designed for that pur-
pose but seeing them helped solidify
our mental pictures of the god i
think boule was the first affected
since it was his job to take photos of
the most significant sculptures all c
us were slightly as these people knew
how to pack an esthetic wallop-but
boule most of all when he came to
believe that priipiirii was alive-well
bhishani felt a tug on the line

  hartwick exhaled against his vi-
sor okay ill ride along but we
have a little problem of diminishing
oxygen we do what

  find out what he wants boule
replied loudly and give it to him
sacrifices propitiation-

  the archaeologist shook his head
not sacrifices necessarily propitia-
tion if we can deduce enough of his
innate qualities to make it possible
but that will be very difficult con-
sidering the alien quality of his for-
mer worshippers the very little data
and time we have available for deduc-
tions- hello speak of the devil and
you do get data

above their heads in the exact cen-
ter of the room a violet cloud had


out of this world adventures

appeared luxuriously it formed it-
self into the familiar figure of prii-
piirii-masculine version

  invisible fear dripped through their
airtight suits and drenched their
skins

lutzman rose his eyes nar-
rowed rwhy do you suppose he
shows himself because we all admit
belief in him now because he wants
to gloat over our helplessness be-
cause hes vain he doesnt seem in-
terested in making any overt move-
all he can do hanging up there like
that is confuse the issue

  he wants worshippers he wants
sacrifices boule insisted all of the
dying-god cults on earth follow that
pattern it must be the same on mars
changing from sex to sex-i read
somewhere that was a manifestation
of what they call a dying-god right
punnello

  no occasionally there is a hint of
hermaphroditism or feminization in
some of the dying-gods earth has
known in the past but not all four
forms at once not even on mars-
whats to prevent us from no
longer believing in him hartwick
wanted to know then he and his
powers no longer exist

  with all these statues and pictures
around you hah thats like that
game-dont think of a white horse
no we have to work out the com-
ponent parts of his nature this race
engaged in both sex and agriculture
in a very offhand--or offclaw way-
so he couldnt be a regenerative deity
now can anyone say whats really in-
tellectual

  no answer they stared up at the
carelessly undulating horror

  i want to examine his solidity
lutzman observed suddenly and
slipped his kazoo from its holster
boule and hartwick both leaped at
him-a moment tardily

 the tinv rocket shell whizzed

through the hovering monster and ex-
ploded against the domed ceiling a 
crack appeared in the highly polished
stone was wiped abruptly clean again
as priipiirii shot over toward it he
raced around the inner room as if in-
specting it for further damage find-
ing none he resumed his position

 hartwick had reached lutzman
first and plucked his weapon away
with a muscled grab out of the cor-
ner of his eye he saw boule jerk to
a stop and level his kazoo at the spe-
cialist in martian biology

 he swung back again fast des-
perately boule pressed the firing stud
and threw himself aside the rocket
hissed past hartwick an immense
gong seemed to ring in their head-
phones as lutzman exploded before
he could scream

  the guide tottered past boule sick-
eningly off balance he knew the gun
was centered on his back that mo-
mentum was carrying him too fast in
the heavy suit to permit him to turn
and fire first and there were three
more rockets in the kazoos cham-
ber  

  he cursed all unstable photogra-
phers and the dim-witted archaeologi-
cal foundations that permitted them
to go on such highly charged expedi-
tions without adequate psychological
probing he heard the sibilant ex-
halation of a shell and his body tried
to hold itself together against the
moment when it would be ripped
apart

  then there was the explosion-and
he was still alive

 hartwick turned slowly there
were clean bits of metal and ugly
shreds of flesh all over the room out-
side of the twisting somehow exul-
tant priipiirii he and punnello were
alone

 the archaeologist sheathed the
kazoo with which he had killed boule
before he could fire at hartwick
sacrifice he mumbled distractedly
the puzzle of priipiirii



he was trying to sacrifice you as
well as lutzman for having blas-
phemed the fool i tried to tell him
terrestrial standards of divinity
didnt apply he was so desperate of
his own life so anxious to placate-
imagine trying to propitiate a god
with the subtle origins of priipiirii
by a hideously blunt sacrifice

  blunt or no that little rumpus
sure cut down our strength by any
other name theyre still sacrifices-
and from the look of that crayfish id
say he was enjoying them thanks for
the shot doc

  punnello nodded and grimaced at
the crustacean god who was now
writhing in unmistakable ecstasy
evil evil yet its obvious theres
no direct malice involved with his
powers-consider the ease with which
he patched the hole in the ceiling-
he could undoubtedly dispose of us in
unnumbered horrific ways somehow
or other we are giving him the kind
of worship he wants-how the god
of the most advanced and most de-
cadent of the mind-stretching mar-
tians-from what weve deciphered in
the other tombs we know that his peo-
ple were both detested and immensely
respected but what is he

 hartwick frowned look ive
been wondering all those pictures
of him we saw as we came down the
ones you said made us believe in him
couldnt they have been put there
just for that purpose

  no much more likely they were
meant to help the creatures who wor-
shipped him by giving them clues as
to what to expect it just occurred to
me this god or super-martian who
was created out of the united aspira-
tions and interests of a race probably
destroyed it there is every indica-
tion that he is highly egocentric the
other temples hinted at his destruc-
tiveness they didnt discuss him
however almost as if they were too
close to worship themselvesw

  the guide nodded and pulled a long
stick of chalk from his flank canister
save it i dont think you could work
out his nature if you stood on your
head and walked around on your ears
who knows what in space those
brainy crayfish considered holy and
if we did figure it out how much
chance would we have of giving him
what he wants no let it ride i said
i had one last idea as to how to crack
this joint-lets try it

 gently punnello smiled at the
chalk oh that no im afraid it
wont work if he can rearrange the
maze if he can repair holes we make
in the stone with our rocket shells-
he walked slowly to the four idols
sitting about their involved game
somehow im positive that this is
the answer why all four manifesta-
tions of priipiirii playing saea against
each other why an altar which is
nothing more than a problem in saea
if we can solve the problem now it
might loosen something essential in
the gods powers there had to be a
reason for this stone game

 listen doc hartwick urged
ive seen too many archaeologists
talking through the top of their heads
because they tried to learn saea and
this problem they set up here is bound
to be ultimate stuff give it the go-by
and come with me

 punnello hadnt heard he was
standing before the board studying
the carved pieces carefully from
time to time he made motions with
a metal-covered hand

hartwick shrugged and strode
into the cable-littered tunnel he
bent over and made a cross on the
floor every ten steps if my oxygen
holds out i should make it he pon-
dered no more circle-walking
after he had gone a hundred feet
he gave up and wandered aimlessly
chalk cross-marks had appeared on
the floor ahead in every tunnel   


out of this world adventures

  when he arrived in the spheroid
room again he walked directly to
punnellos gesticulating figure he
froze when he saw the archaeologists
contorted face now screaming at the
four red idols now raised in anguish
to the god floating in his carnate pur-
ple he understood the muted gibber-
ings he had been hearing in the head-
set for the past fifteen minutes-and
had dismissed as punnellos neces-
sary self-communion over the saea
problem

  punnello stood before the immut-
able saea problem-and was mad

  the guide clenched his fist fiercely
then sighed and opened his fingers
wearily there was nothing to strike
nothing to grip nothing   

  he dropped to the floor and spread
himself on his back the moment he
lay down priipiirii left the insane
archaeologist to undulate over him

  what are you he wondered no-
ticing the first faint foulness in his
oxygen supply what do you want
why do you tear us down this way
when weve done nothing to you
you arent the kind of god who would
punish for desecration of his tem-
ple

 as if in reply the deity went
through all of his sexual forms end-
ing up as masculine once more hart-
wick watched cursing

  his sanity began to slip into the
narrow chasm of the problem he got
a grip on it by reverting to practical
approaches lutzman had taken a shot
at it perhaps-

  his oxygen already was dangerous-
ly low

  he shot at it several times useless
weapons were useless here lutzman
shouldnt have tried if lutzman
hadnt been killed he might have been
able to work out the gods desires
from crustacean psychology

  an angle his mind fogged by the
poisons his respiratory system was
inhaling in lieu of air groped des-

perately what-what would be a
highly intellectuallized crustacean
viewpoint not really crustacean
though-martian biology was so dif-
ferent that bioareology was the name
of the science here-lutzman now
lutzman might have   

  desperate struggling through the
night that was coming down over his
brain it was such torment to breathe
-to think-crustacean-that was it-
all he had to do was work out some-
thing peculiarly crustacean-

  priipiirii replied again this time
he became a fish a mammoth a mar-
tian polar beetle in turn then him-
self again

  hartwicks mind hartwicks life
slipped out too fast for him to hold
on faster-

 above him the god watched the
approaching extinction of his last
worshipper-which meant his own ex-
tinction too-with courteous delight
faster and more ecstatic grew his
squirmings over the two dying luna-
tics in the temple of a dead and de-
cadent race so sweet to receive again
obeisance from insanity

ously and intricately the god of

pallas rebellion

       by w malcolm white

 nphe first hint about the robot trouble on the
 planetoid palla to reach us came from that
 intrepid reporter of interplanetary news san-
 dra de long sandra had been on pallas in-
 vestigating the plutonium mines there

   she hadnt been on the trail of any specific
 story but just sort of writing a book about the
 major asteroids and their scenic interests pal-
 las you know has the only natural deposit of
 pure plutonium in the solar system-outside of
 the debatable and inaccessible claims made for
 certain mountains on neptunes smaller moon
 because plutonium is the stuff from which
 atomic reactors are made its valuable and still
 pretty expensive to fabricate even in this day
 and age two hundred and fifty years after the
 manhattan project

   plutonium being highly radioactive is
mined exclusively by robots they are directed
from the mining settlement of valiersdorf
where the terrestrial technicians and reduc-
ition engineers live sandra had sent back two
stories about the rough-and-ready life of the
mining town-mostly pure invention since the
pioneering days have long been past and the
hermetically enclosed town is as comfortable as
any suburban hamlet on earth

   but sandra had an eye for odd detail and
 she had ferreted out some of the older artifacts
 and one of the worked-out pits and had poked
 her shapely nose into the robot warrens too in
 her last broadcast she had spoken of trouble
 with the robots there was a steadily increasing
 number of inexplicable errors in their work
 one technician had already expressed the
 thought that the radioactivity of the mines was
 impairing their mechanism

   sandra had suggested that perhaps exposure
 to the vast power of the plutonium had altered
 the delicate atomic chargings of the robotic
 brains robots as you know are thinking be-

ings in a way-they are equipped with me-
chanical brains that can and do transact ele-
mentary reasoning enough for their jobs these
brains are fairly delicate and are always en-
closed in a transparent shell where their dials
and adjustments can be periodically checked

  the next thing we of the asteroid patrol
knew word came that pallas had suddenly
gone out of communication with the rest of the
universe our ships were ordered there

  about our space cruiser there was plenty of
speculation about the mission ted winstoc
our commander was specially worried and as
his lieutenant i knew what was bothering him
it wasnt robot trouble it was sandra they
were engaged

  when our vessels came in sight of pallas
everything seemed quiet true there was no
sign of life in the mines the doomed town
seemed strangely silent and lightless but
nothing was exploding

  we settled for a landing near the town when
flie first robot battery opened up on us it was
a near thing it was what we had expected the
blast of an atom-heat ray just missed our ship
-had it hit us wed have blown up and that
would be the end of this story but it missed
doubtless because of inexperience and because
it wasnt a true weapon it was a mining beam
up-ended and being worked as a gun

  we got out of its range and made a landing
in a small valley between two tiny pallasian
stony hills

  pallas is like the rest of the asteroids a bare
lifeless rocky world none of these tiny planets
have the gravity to hold down an atmosphere
and you cant walk about without a space mask
and your own portable air supply

  ted and i took counsel as to what to do next
the question was who had shot at us and why
someone had to go out and investigate and it
would have to be us then sparks came in and
told us there was a message coming in

  it was from the robots they had announced
their independence they were going to hold the
mines and earth crew as hostages and they
were willing to release sandra de long to us
as evidence of their good faith sandra they
announced would be able to give us the dope
on their demands

  it was clear just the same that the brains of
the robots were cracked just the way the thing
was worded was proof of it they couldnt hope
to win still ted told me if we could get san-
dra clear hed feel a lot better about dealing
with the situation for of course we could not
make a deal with these lunatic machines

  ted told the-xobots by radio to bring sandra
to the ship and he would meet them they
must come unarmed they agreed

  we didnt want ted to chance it but he in-
sisted sandra was his girl and he wasnt going
to let someone else risk her rescue he put on
his air helrpet took his gun and left the ship
the rest of us watching with baited breath
from the ships observation ports

  coming towards the ship we could now see
a robot and it was carrying something it came
closer we gasped

  the metal man was carrying sandra like a
sack of potatoes slung under one arm the
poor girl was wiggling and apparently yelling
for help

  ted winston stood like a man struck the
sight was certainly calculated to drive him
nuts he couldnt dare attack the robot now
even though he could see the thing was armed
and that if it got too close the machine-man
could probably destroy our space ships with a
good blast-or at least ground them

  ted was in a spot and i didnt envy him
he couldnt dare fire for his shot would de-
stroy sandra too he couldnt dare not fire in
spite of robot promises bccausc the ships and
his men were in danger the rohot had violated
its promise and was armed

  it was an old gangster trick-the helpless
hostage as a shield for the killer

  then ted winston did what we never ex-
pected he dashed forward raised his flame
pistol and fired fired point-blank at the robot
-and at sandra

  the robot sizzled for a moment and then
suddenly the robot simply exploded there
was a terrific flash and when the dust cleased
there was only a hole in the ground and little
bits of metal and sandra scattered about

  but ted somehow didnt seem appalled at
what looked to us like a cold-blooded act of
murder-how could lie kill his own fiancee like

that

  we dashed out of the ship armed and sur-
rounded him and then in a few words we un-
derstood

  ted had saved us all for he had recognized
the robot plot and we had not the thing we
thought was sandra was not her at all-it was
a cunningly constructed robot-designed to
look like sandra and actually loaded with
enough plutonium to blow our ship to smithe-
reens it was the intent of the robots to hand
her over to is to have ted bring her aboard
our ships under the impression it was sandra
and there to blow ourselves up when the
dummy detonated

  but how had ted caught wise to all this
simple when you think of it and a robot
wouldnt think of it they dont have to
breathe you know it never occurred to them
to put an air helmet on their dummy sandra
but ted knew that the real sandra couldnt
have survived out there in the airless surface
of pallas couldnt have yelled as the phony
sandra did couldnt have been so obviously
active in the robots clutches so he destroyed
them both

  how we rescued the real sandra and the
pallas rebellion collapsed is a story you all
know from your history books but the story
of ted winstons clever act of deduction is
probably new to you

bogey man

 there really was a big green bogey man in peters bedroom
    and nobody would take any notice so how could you
 expect a little boy like peter to keep the monster from
 making unearthly atomic machines from the toys in the closet

             by lloyd williams

mothers voice
was savage now
i dont want to
hear one more peep
from you tonight
and she snapped
off the light and
slammed the door behind her

  for a minute peter dared not stir
in the bed she had waited outside the
door to listen then remember
now she called and he heard her
go down the hall

  he looked over in the corner you
could see the bogey man now he
shone green in the darkness the

luminous green body uncoiled and
faced outward from the wall hands
away from eyes and stared down at
the scattered pieces of meccano

  peter was suddenly frightened it
wasnt me i didnt do it he called
the big green-and-yellow eyes turned
toward him no he whispered it
wasnt mei   

  no sounds came from downstairs
dad wasnt home yet and mother
must be reading if only jimmy were
around but jimmy was away at
boarding school and his room next
door was empty

  the bogey man looked at him and
he could not call out

 then the eyes turned away the
body crouched on the floor and he
heard the pieces of his toy builders
set being gathered together he
moyed his head over to the side of
the bed and watched click-cjick
green hands picked up the metal rods
and fastened them in place he heard
the screw-driver at work and saw
only vague movement in the darkened
room click-click how can he see
peter wondered the big eyes turned
toward him again and he felt drowsy
he wanted to move to ask questions
but he was dead tired too sleepy   
in the morning first thing peter
ran to his toy cupboard yes there
was the meccano packed away on the
first shelf he took out the box and
opened it all the pieces were in
place each group tied in the right
tray it was just like the other morn-
ings there was nothing to see why
doesnt he leave me something built
thought peter and as he shut the
cupboard door he looked into the
shadowed corner

  at breakfast dad made fun of him
well me lad he said i under-
stand you have a visitor

  i do said peter mother doesnt
believe me but i do

  hes all green and cant be seen
said dad and chuckled

  peter felt muddled and lonely he
doesnt like the light and you can
only see him in the dark he said

  naturally hes transparent but
slightly fluorescent

  now ralph said mother thats
no way to talk you mustnt encour-
age peter to go on the main thing
is-

  really after all i didnt invent
this monster sylvia

  the main thing is to stop peter
from walking around and playing
when he should be in bed you must
talk to him seriously ralph

  now look here said dad i was
not here when it started was i
no of course you werent you
never are when anything difficult
comes up always off on a trip
mother stood up the whole load
falls on me oh im so tired of it
all

  wait sylvia dad got up too
forget what i said i know its hard
for you    as she left the room he
called ill get to the bottom of this
and fix it up do you hear

  peter started to eat his egg hur-
riedly

  dad looked at him sternly funs
fun he said but mother tells me
youre out of bed every night now
playing with your toys instead of
sleeping

  its not me he wanted to say but
dad cut in and theres no use blam-
ing it all on this little green man
look my boy youre too old for
things like this you must stop being
a baby and think of your mother
aw gee dad said peter its
the truth honest ill show you if-
no    stop that you get off to
school now but tonight were going
to have a serious talk about this
please dad itll only take a min-
ute come upstairs and ill show you
honest

  but when he opened the cupboard
door dad didnt look quickly enough
the shipwrecked bogey man



 peter glanced up and saw that he had
 failed dont you see the green he
 asked look and he swung the
 door to and fro three times in suc-
 cession

   dad straightened up you go to
 school he said ill see you to-
 night

   it was no use

   that night he was sent to bed
 early and the light bulb was removed
 from its socket my flashlight he
 suggested and they took it away too

   you cant do much fooling around
 now said dad

   so he lay in bed and waited while
 the room grew darker and the house
 became quiet his eyes were fastened
 on where the toy cupboard rested
 against the wall he heard a scraping
 noise something moved in the cup-
 board there was a snap-the little
 door opened and the green froglike
 man was crouched down and backing
 onto the floor

   the bogey man carried something
 out with him-the builders set-and
 put it down he opened it and turned
 towards peter the big eyes looked
 at peter for a long time a long long
 time   

 ttthen he examined the cupboard
 vv next day jimmys chemistry
 set was lying on top of his own mec-
 cano box and packed neatly away
 behind were some of dads tools-he
 saw the soldering iron-and what
 looked like pieces from the radio
 peter grew frightened no he
 whispered you shouldnt do that
 ill get in trouble he reached in for
 jimmys box and then drew back the
 bogey man mightnt like it

   he was halfway downstairs badly
 worried when dads shout came

   what the devils wrong with this
 damn thing

   what do you mean ralph called
 mother

   the radio dammit all thats

what i mean what happened to it

  he waited there as mother ran out
from the kitchen dad was moving
the radio around and grumbling

 why theres a tube missing
shouted dad that little devil  

  peter ran back upstairs and went
quickly to the cupboard now he was
in for it jimmys box the tools the
mass of wires-he piled them together
and gathered them up in his arms
what about the radio thing too late
-they knew about that he took the
rest and hid them under the bed in
jimmys room now dad was shout-
ing something at the foot of the stairs
and mother was talking low plead-
ing he ran back for the meccano box
emptied all the pieces from it under
jimmys bed and put the box in his
own cupboard again he threw the
radio tube on his floor and started
down for breakfast

  dad was coming up the stairs he
went past peter into the room and
picked up the tube well he said
just as i thought dont think thats
at all funny peter

  and later as he got up from the
breakfast table dad said hold on
my boy im going to put an end to
your playing around in the middle
of the night its got to stop   
understand

  peter was silent

  tonight you sleep locked in your
room were taking all your things
out from there dyou hear

  yes sir said peter

  all right away you go

  when he camc in from school that
afternoon his room looked bare his
comb and toothbrush were left on the
dresser the towel still hung over the
radiator everything else was gone
he looked in the games cupboard all
his stuff had been removed even his
skates and helmet and of course the
box of meccano but far at the back
as he closed the door there seemed
to be a flicker of green


out of this world adventures

  peter rushed down the hall into
jimmys room and looked under the
bed he sighed with relief-they were
just as hed left them

  nobody was around it took him
two trips to carry everything away
and he hid the lot underneath some
things in his clothes closet when it
was done he felt safe for the first
time that day

  dad took a last look around every-
where before he locked peter in at
bedtime understand now peter he
said im going to be listening to-
night i dont want to spank you but
i will if you make me

  yes dad

  nighty-night old boy

  night dad

  then the key turned and he was
alone

peter didnt go to sleep he
waited until the house was quiet
and then as silently as possible
climbed out of bed it was awful
leaving behind the protection of his
covers but he had to do it he felt
naked and defenseless as he crossed
the room and the squeaking of the
closet door scared him terribly all
the same he did what he must-un-
covered the pile of things hidden be-
neath the clothes and carried it all
out onto the floor

  there the whole lot was all right
as he handled things he checked in
his mind the chemistry set tools
building pieces wires-everything
his worries were over he could go
back to bed

  he took one step and then froze
in sudden terror

  the radio piece

  hed forgotten the tube

  coldness crept over peter and he
began to shake he couldnt move
couldnt think realization of failure
made him sick and he didnt know
what to do

  it was all so stupid hed meant to

take jimmys radio the one jimmy
wasnt allowed at school and which
was in the dresser drawer in the next
room nobody would have known
hed planned to bring it in with the
rest of the stuff

  and hed forgotten

  peter went over to the door and
tried it no use it was locked there
was no way out hed have to stay
and wait for-

  he grabbed the handle and shook
hard the door rattled he couldnt
stay in here not without a radio
tube a coldness came all over his
skin and he got set to shout

  dad would kill him if he shouted
it would be terrible he remembered
dads face in the morning

  with a moan of fear peter slipped
to his knees at the door he couldnt
do anything not a thing

  snap

  horrified he looked behind him
yes it was the cupboard door the
bogey man he tried to take his eyes
away and couldnt he couldnt move
he crouched there and watched the
gleaming body back out of the cup-
board

  over to the pile on the floor went
the green figure it bent down and
for some minutes examined the things
peter had placed there the luminous
fingers turned over piece after piece
and all the while peter waited in ter-
ror for the discovery

  impatiently the bogey man scat-
tered the pile about the floor the
figure came erect glanced again at
the objects around its feet and then
peter saw the huge glowing eyes turn
full upon himself now he thought-
now

  time stopped nothing happened
then slowly with no noise the
bogey man moved toward him the
green-and-yellow eyes came closer
became immense in size-they filled
peters world and without knowing
why or even when it had happened
the shipwrecked bogey man



peter found himself without fear
the green man was beside him those
eyes were on a level with his own
and there was no menace no sugges-
tion of danger he watched one glim-
mering hand reach past him saw the
little piece of metal pushed into the
lock of the door--then there was a
click and he knew the door could be
opened

 when he went to get jimmys
radio the little man crouched in a
corner with eyes averted from the
hall light silently peter returned
with his burden shut the door and
climbed back into bed inside he felt
relief and pride-he was all right
now and he had done well

as he lay there a sense of in-
timacy with the bogey man grew
in his mind he watched the green
body crouched on the floor hands
moving busily and the room seemed
a warm and friendly place thoughts
drifted into his mind-he too
seemed to be out on the floor working
with feverish haste before him the
apparatus grew  fit this bar here
across the frame fine now the fields
interlock at the point so the next
conductor    a-ah there also must
the crystal be mounted or so it
seemed and he glanced aside at the
bath in which it was growing

  it made no sense to him and yet it
did words and pictures were in his
mind they were unfamiliar totally
so yet for an instant they meant
something it was the ship of course
or a sort of a ship you might even
call it an escalator that was what
the apparatus was for

  lucky the chemicals were available
for that crystal bath thats the way
it went though you expected that
and just for luck-in case things
went wrong and you had a shipwreck
-why you carried a seed crystal with
you they were unobtainable ex-
cept  

  peter understood about the wreck
the bogey man didnt want to be
here it was an accident or maybe
an enemy at home anyhow    now
the multiplier not the same tube as
last night this one would do though
hook it into the field-guide frame-
work and test for gravitational direc-
tion   

  there

  he watched while the horn-shaped
crystal was lifted from the bath and
measured good enough-just two ad-
justments to make in the circuit con-
stants and perhaps    wait one
last check over the whole setup   

  peters head was down on the pil-
low it was almost morning his whole
body was desperately tired but he
must stay awake-just a little longer

  everything was ready now soon it
would be good-bye peter fought his
body into sitting position a friend
was going away beyond his reach
forever and he wanted to watch he
must see it all the whole thing and
hug it in his memory

  the green hand slipped a plug into
the wall outlet and all eyes in the
room turned toward the apparatus
they waited anxiously  it should
work

  down the hall a door opened there
was the sound of feet and peter
tensed what was dad doing

  the green figure stood erect mo-
tionless only the one shuffling noise
could be heard closer closer   
then peter relaxed the bathroom
dad was going there

  outside there was a jarring noise
a glass smashed on the floor and he
could hear dads low grumbling
tones stubbed his toe thought peter
and he was filled with relief they
were still all right nobody would
come in

a new yellowish glow caught his
eye and he looked back to the center
o-f the room exultation arose in him

noted almost unconsciously there
were no beads of condensation upon
the smooth surface of the glass it
offended his sense of the fitness of
things this minor irritation served
to drag his mind away from the irrev-
ocable past back to the things in the
here and now

  he looked around him trying to
find something of glamor in his sur-
roundings something of interest
something to shake him out of the
black mood into which he had fallen
but this was he thought the drab-
best world to which he had ever come
in all his long career as an interstel-
lar navigator the drabbest world
and the drabbest people outside-
the mud and the low unlovely
buildings and the eternal mists that
forever drenched this small unim-
portant planet and forever hid from
view its dim ruddy sun and inside
-a reaction from the all-pervading
humidity

  the martian room they called it
this place in which he was spending
this evening of his shore leave the
martian room-and in all probability
he alone of all those present was the
only one who had ever visited that
planet but the name mars was a part
of the language of man no matter
where he might be no matter upon
which of the man-colonized worlds in
even the remotest sectors of the gal-
axy he might be living for mars had
been the first world other than his
own to hear the thunder of his rock-
ets had been the first world outside
of earth on which he had lived and
died-and been born tenacious is the
memory of the race and long the
memory of those early struggles be-
fore ever the interstellar drive had
been conceived and so it is that in
the language of man anywhere the
word mars has become synonymous
with dryness

  save for the fact that he would
have required neither furs nor res-

  pirator a martian colonist could have
found no fault with this martian
room the air was dry dry with an
aridity that tickled the skin and
rasped the throat the walls were
cunning three dimensional murals of
desert and flimsy attenuated cacti
and low red sandstone cliffs over-
head a white shrunken sun together
with a few of the brighter stars
blazed in an almost indigo sky

  and the music was dry arid a dead
rustle of strings and a brittle rattling
of drums the dancer on the little
stage had consummate skill had
grace of a sort but she was-or so
thought pierre leclerc-no more than
a sere withered leaf drifting aim-
lessly before the wind before the
autumn wind down-whirling into
drab and dusty oblivion

  leclerc shuddered looked away
from the stage he thought almost
longingly of his cosy cabin aboard
pegasus of the warm wardroom of
the pleasant company of his ship-
mates who had been too lazy or too
wise to brave the damp misery of the
night for the sake of such dubious
over-priced pleasures as this unim-
portant city of an unimportant planet
had to offer leclerc sipped his wine
shrugged his shoulders almost imper-
ceptibly he knew that the mood
which was robbing his evening of en-
joyment would have done so any-
where in almost any company

 and there was no company here
that would or could interest him his
uniform-that of an officer of one of
the rare interstellar ships-had at-
tracted attention would have served
as sufficient introduction at any of the
other tables but he had already re-
jected overtures of friendship had
refused invitations to join parties
the men in the place were a pallid
bloodless lot withered almost deadly
drab they must thought leclerc
smiling faintly at the conceit breathe
through silica gel filters   
terror of the mist-maidens



 the women would have been-pos-
sible but there was something blatant
about them some hint of a desperate
hunger that repelled him he was
very much of the cat this night-
kiplings cat that walked by its wild
lone through the wild wet woods he
sat by himself small dark and self-
sufficient cloaked with an arrogance
a prickly inviolability that hid a
nameless indefinable need

leclerc looked away from the
stage looked towards the door
something not quite presentiment
not quite hope had told him that
just possibly somebody of impor-
tance might be coming in he dis-
trusted the extra-sensory warning
sneered at himself for heeding it yet
looked and the attendant at the door
uniformed in a flimsy imitation of
martian furs and breathing mask
flung it open

  the woman entered first and a
pace or so behind her the two men
she was tall this woman and silver-
blonde and she carried herself like a
queen the face was too strong for
conventional prettiness and the
mouth too wide the cheekbones too
prominent the skin of her shoulders
was in dazzling creamy contrast to
the black gown thait did little to hide
the well rounded graceful strength of
her figure

  the two men also were in black
but their clothing although absolute-
ly plain had all the severity of a uni-
form and they were armed from
belted holsters protruded the butts
of some kind of hand weapon they
walked warily but with something of
the arrogance of the professional
bully their pale eyes shifted con-
tinually in their pale hard faces and
their hands never strayed far from
the pistol grips of their weapons

  an obsequious waiter fluttered be-
fore the woman led her to a vacant
table not far from leclercs she said

yes this will do and sank into the
chair that had been pulled out for
her her voice was cold and clear
and gave the impression of perfect
control the two men-bodyguards
-took stations behind her chair one
of them glared at leclerc who real-
ized that he must have been taking
an unmannerly interest

  but he wasnt the only one the
music was still playing the dancer
was still jerkily posturing on the
little stage but all the little back-
ground noises of the place the tinkle
of glasses the low murmur of con-
versation the occasional shuffle of
feet had died there was a tension in
the air a hushed expectancy and   

  the darkness came with the impact
of a physical blow it came with the
vicious crackle of hand weapons was
broken briefly and terrifyingly by
livid stabs and bursts of flame there
was the crashing of overturned tables
and chairs there were shouts and
screams somebody was trapped
among the percussion instruments of
the orchestra and the wild clashing
of cymbals matched and augmented
the growing panic

  there was the smell of ozone

  there was the smell of burning

  and there was another smell dank
dead yet alive sickly sweet

  somebody found the light switch
the glare of the concealed lights of
the imitation sun in the high ceiling
was dazzling painful it showed con-
fusion terror smashed glassware
overturned furniture frightened peo-
ple cowering behind the pitifully in-
adequate cover of chairs and tables
it showed charred still smouldering
scars on floor and walls and ceiling

  leclerc got unsteadily to his feet
the shooting seemed to be over-and
it seemed those who had been doing
the shooting would never shoot again
the two men in black were sprawled
upon the floor motionless their still-
smoking blasters were grasped in


out of this world adventures

their hands but those hands looked
somehow very dead leclerc was
curious and he wondered too where
the woman was she had not looked
the type to bolt for cover as soon as
trouble started and she had not
looked the type to desert her friends
or servants whatever they had been

 he went down on his knees beside
the nearest of the two bodyguards
turned the body over from a prone to
a supine position it was limp in his
hands cold the face was unmarked
but the man had died in a spasm of
pain and fear that had contorted the
features into a terrifying mask

 the spaceman shuddered turned
away from the unpleasant sight he
found himself looking at the polished
surface of the table at which the
woman had been sitting it was misted
faintly with some dampness that was
fast vanishing- in the dry air and
scrawled in the mistiness were words
fading fast but still barely legible

  follow he read mount tannen-
burg   

  and that was all

 and then the police arrived and
took charge

leclerc stood in the muddy
road outside police headquar-
ters it was dark and the street lamps
were mere diffuse blurs of light con-
fusing rather than aiding vision the
air was full of the not unmusical
sound of water trickling from roofs
and walls along the deep gutters on
either side of the roadway a heli-
copter threshed overhead flying low
audible but invisible

 the navigator thought of walking
to the nearest automatic beacon and
calling an air taxi to take him back
to the spaceport to his ship but it
was only a half-hearted desire and it
took no great effort of will for him
to overcome it

  his mood in the main was one of
indignation he had been ready as a

matter of course to help the local
police force in their investigation of
the murders and the kidnaping but
he had first been treated as a suspect
and then snubbed insulted

  so he thought bitterly i am to
mind my own business i am to go
back to my ship and stay there i am
to take orders from a fat hick po-
liceman    he grinned if hed had
the manners to provide me with
transport back to the ship i might
have gone    now   

  his grin faded what he wondered
was he to do what could he do

  a figure loomed out of the fog
stopped before him from beneath a
weatherproof cowl peered a womans
face the woman said it is you the
little officer from the interstellar
ship i hoped i would find you here

  leclerc bowed

 you have found me mademoi-
selle he agreed amiably what
now

  just this what did alina write
on the table

  i would suggest that you call in
there he gestured towards the dim-
ly lighted doorway from which he
had come to enquire

 you know or should know how
much use that would be but others
in the martian room saw writing on
that table although you were the only
one close enough to read it before it
faded they saw you read it what
was it

 leclerc countered with another
question

  have you a spurling he asked
or any kind of flying machine with
maps and instruments it is too late
to think of hiring one at this time of
night even if i had the necessary
money on me for the deposit  

  you didnt answer my question

  lend me something that flies and
i will

 the woman smiled in the dim
light leclerc saw that it was a hard
terror of the mist-maidens



smile and reckless yet not unattrac-
tive and her voice when she replied
had softened she said

  i can see that you want to help
alina very well you shall but you
must let me know what it was that
she wrote

  i will when im sure that youre
on the same side as i as she i feel
that the message that she left was
for me and that i should be letting
her down if i passed it on to the
wrong people i feel somehow that
i have done so already those police-
men-i did not trust them  

 how right you were but-what
was the message

  i told you my terms

  very well

  she raised her right hand leclerc
fearing a weapon jumped back but
it was only a small silver whistle that
she held that she brought to her lips
hardly had its thin sweet blast
sounded than a dozen forms mate-
rialized out of the mist rushed in
upon him from all sides he tried to
fight but when his first blow landed
he automatically checked himself
his reason told him that this was
one of the occasions when it would
be in order to strike a woman but
by the time that his natural chivalry
saw sense it was too late for him to
do anything about it his captors all
women hustled him away from the
dangerous vicinity of police head-
quarters down a side turning there
was something standing there some-
thing huge and dim with great
spreading vanes he was pushed into
the cajbin bhoved on to a seat with
three of the women piled on top of
him under its whirling vanes the
copter lifted

  all right girls said the pilot
let him up now but keep him cov-
ered

 leclerc disheveled and embar-
rassed levered himself to a sitting
position he looked into the pilots

cabin saw by the dim light from in-
struments and radar screen that the
woman who had met him outside po-
lice headquarters was at the controls
her face was serious grim she
turned to face him and said im
sorry but theres no time to lose
really theres not you must believe
me

  where are you going now

 to the airport i-we-have a
spurling there after that you give
the orders

  mount tannenburg said leclerc
suddenly

  all of five thousand miles said
the woman we must hurry then
she should have told us but she
liked playing a lone hand and she
should have known that those two
pet gorillas of hers were no protec-
tion

there was surprisingly little de-
lay at the airport there were
of course the inevitable forms to fill
in the inevitable questions to answer
but the sleepy officials on duty
seemed to see nothing strange in a
visiting spaceman being dragged off
on an aerial sightseeing trip by his
hostesses nor in fact was there
leclerc had known parties with much
wilder aftermaths

  the spurling rose vertically on its
turret drive then leveled off the
lights below them faded fast into the
mists there was mist above them all
around them the woman-the boss
woman was how leclerc was thinking
of her-busied herself at the controls
setting the course for mount tannen-
burg then with the automatic pilot
functioning sweetly she came aft into
the main cabin she said my name
is marilyn hall

  and mine said leclerc is le-
clerc pierre leclerc he slightly
accented the given name

  these five others leclerc said
marilyn are peters magrath fan-


out of this world adventures

tozzi andrevitch and connor   
the spaceman bowed to the women
thinking that marilyn hall might
have told him their names more fully
not that it mattered at a time like
this social niceties were unimportant
he concentrated his attention on
marilyn hall rather liking what he
saw she was a redhead with good
teeth an almost translucent skin and a
sprinkling of freckles her figure was
good and her dress was not trying
very hard to conceal the fact

  he said now what cooks

  its not too long a story leclerc
and well have time to tell it prop-
erly these ladies here and myself
and of coursc alina rae are mem-
bers of a more or less secret society
alina was our president we havent
bothered with any fancy names weve
had our passwords of course weve
had to have them weve had to work
underground and the only men who
have officially known of our exis-
tence have been those two body-
guards of alinas

  but i may as well start at the be-
ginning this world as you prob-
ably know has been colonized for
about two hundred years when we
came here it was to all intents and
purposes just a dead ball of inorganic
matter revolving around its primary
and yet conditions were suitable for
life as we know it so plant and ani-
mal life were imported together with
the first human colonists

  it isnt-wasnt-a bad world you
i know wouldnt think much of it
ever but its what were used to we
were happy here until  

her face clouded leclerc watched
her hands her fists clenching and
unclenching he wondered what it
was that she hated so the viciousness
in her last few sentences had rather
shocked him

  i was to be married she said
qh he was nothing wonderful

just a junior meteorologist in the
weather bureau but we were rather
badly in love you know what its
like or dont you you make plans
for the future either absurdly am-
bitious ones or very sensible strictly
down-to-earth ones but whichever
way its fun and you get to the
stage where conversation isnt really
necessary and some kind of limited
telepathy comes into operation and
its all a matter of feeling rather than
speaking and hearing   

  then quite suddenly he changed
it was hard to define that change
but that beautiful sense of oneness
was gone and i sensed that he was
giving me his time his precious time
more out of loyalty than because of
love he just wasnt interested any
longer and yet try as i might i
couldnt discover any rival not any
human rival

  i suppose that between me and-
whatever it was he must have been
in a little private hell of his own
and perhaps i helped to stoke the
fires up a little anyhow one fine
morning he stepped over the parapet
of the met bureau observation
tower and that was that

  i-oh skip it it doesnt matter
but i began to find that i wasnt the
only one whod been through that
particular mill theres alina rae-
her husbands still alive still around
but he wants nothing of her there
are our friends here and all the other
women some in our organization
some not but we-those of us who
organized-have been investigating
and weve found    weve found
   how can i tell you youll think
us mad

  leclerc youve traveled youve
been everywhere can there be such
a thing as an intelligent gas-and
could it take the form of a woman
a desirable woman

  i dont know ive never heard of
it but that need not mean that theres
terror of the mist-maidens



no such thing there are the gaseous
entities of fomalhaut viii and they
have sexes of a sort but it seems to
be a matter of electrical attraction
and repulsion so far as the scientists
can make out some of the entities
carry a negative charge and some a
positive theres some kind of union
with thunder and lightning-oh its
all very much according to the hand-
books of physics but it seems to work
at least as well as our way of doing
things does

 so it is-possible now this is
what we know one of our members
walked out on her husband she
walked out but he left something
behind in the apartment a concealed
camera set to start up as soon as her
husband came in that night the film
at first was boring just a man alone
in the house doing all the silly things
that men do when theyre alone and
then he did something exceptionally
silly he opened the window sat
down by the open window in his easy
chair

 the fog came in of course and
something more than the fog it was
a dim shimmering shape-it could
have been roughly human in form but
that isnt important it seemed ac-
cording to the film to have its own
luminosity but i wish that we could
have seen it as he seemed to be seeing
it i wish that any of us could bring
such a look to a-mans face it settled
around him that cloud of gas or
whatever it was as he sat in his chair
and that was all there was to it after
a while it went and left him sleeping

  that was just the beginning but
with that as a guide we found out
that these    mist people or what-
ever they are were responsible for all
of our miseries once a man has
known them he forgets us no not
forgets perhaps but his attitude is-
how shall i put it-one of contemp-
tuous toleration nothing that we can
do-and you should know how much

a woman can do-will ever change it
and even when the men realize their
   guilt the power of these living
mists is enough to stifle any impulse
they may have towards faithfulness
or decency

 well we worked it was dull
work checking and rechecking fol-
lowing every conceivable lead we
had to find out where these things
came from and we had too to main-
tain secrecy for we could no longer
trust any of the men of this world

  you havent been here long enough
to feel the dreadful atmosphere of
sex antagonism of fear and hostility
yet i assure you that it is very real
it is a poison that is making our lives
a misery it is a poison that will mean
the end of the race on this planet and
on other worlds if it spreads you
havent been infected yet you with
your experience might be able to help
us   

  i will promised leclerc to the
best of my ability but your leader
alina what had she found

 we know now she had discovered
where these    things come from
and that knowledge must be impor-
tant otherwise she would never have
been taken as she was there had
been attempts before at killing her
but they had been made by men ii
you could call them men by poor
crazed creatures completely domi-
nated by the evil thing from tannen-
burg two of them we handed over
to the authorities and we dont know
what happened to them the third
one we questioned ourselves he was
stubborn and he    died   

  leclerc shivered a little he felt
that this was a war in which any per-
son of sense would remain neutral
he knew women-and knowing them
was inclined in his heart of hearts
to fear them the old poet who had
made the crack about the female d
the species being deadlier than the
male had been right


out of this world adventures

frward in the pilots cabin a
buzzer started to souncl marilyn
hall stiffened abruptly then hurried
to her controls leclerc went with her
one radar screen showed the terri-
tory over which they were flying
lakes and forests and at wide inter-
vals the geometric regularities of
towns other screens covered the
ships surroundings in the vertical
plane and it was on one of these
screens that a speck of light was
steadily expanding

  right astern whispered the girl
fifty miles and coming up fast
can we get any more speed out
of this crate asked leclerc

  no and thatll be a police ship
after us and nothing on this world
can outrun them   

  the wail of a siren burst from the
spurlings receiver swelled filled the
cabin with panic inducing waves of
sound it ceased abruptly and then
a clipped official sounding voice said
calling ship zx calling ship
zx heave to heave to at once
marilyn hall and pierre leclerc nav-
igator of the interstellar ship pega-
sus wanted for questioning

  leclerc went to the microphone he
said slowly leclerc here i question
your jurisdiction over an officer of
the federation   

  the speaker laughed nastily le-
clerc could picture the fat police offi-
cial with whom he had already had
dealings chuckling over his micro-
phone the tinny voice said i pack
my jurisdiction in six launching
tubes well stand for no nonsense
are you heaving to

  no declared leclerc then over
his shoulder to the girl how far
thirty miles still outside the
range of their weapons

  and about nine hours flying time
till to tannenburg

  correct

 so

  so we have no intention of being

blasted out of the sky leclerc but
we have every intention of getting
to tannenburg better hold on im
going upstairs

  the man staggered as the spurl-
ings nose lifted sharply he clutched
the back of the pilots seat yet still
had difficulty in maintaining his bal-
ance then with dazzling abruptness
it was light the ship had burst from
the eternal mists into the thin air
above the everlasting overcast astern
of them the ruddy sun was lifting
over a vast unbroken sea of red-
tinged cloud he looked aft a long
way away still slightly below them
was something from which the suns
almost level rays were reflected in
silver fire

  still the spurling climbed and it
seemed to leclerc that the police ship
was lagging was losing altitude it
puzzled him

  marilyn hall sensing his bewilder-
ment laughed this ship she said
belongs to fantozzi here her hus-
band is rich-too much money and
frankly our lisa is a little bit of a
snob no locally made plane was good
enough for her she had to have an
imported model and the most ex-
pensive imported models are those
from castor iv what do you know
of castor iv

  leclerc thought hard he tried to
remember his one visit to that world
many years ago he succeeded in re-
calling to his minds eye a vision of
barren desolate rocks relieved here
and there by the glittering crystal-
line domes of the human cities he
saw the black sky the intolerably
bright sun the unwinking stars he
said slowly and doubtfully no
surface atmosphere  no use for
regular planes 

  and rocket drive for above-sur-
face transport the castorians have
modified the hull design of their ex-
port model spurlings but not the
drive our police department stick
terror of the mist-maidens



to locally manufactured ships and
ram jets given an atmosphere in
which to work their athodyds are
fast fast but we have the heels of
them now

  theyve given up called one of
the women

  no said marilyn theyll be
waiting for us at mount tannenburg

they were waiting at mount tan-
nenburg the police ship that had
chased them was there and half a
dozen others one hovered on its tur-
ret drive directly above the twenty
thousand foot peak the others main-
tained a constant patrol over the
surrounding terrain marilyn hall
picked them up on her screens when
she was still outside the maximum
range of any of their weapons she
sat over her controls frowning

  leclerc in the co-pilots chair
looked at her worried face asked
himself what she was going to do
what she could do and it wasnt as
though they knew where to go what
to look for a message scrawled on
a misted table top carried compulsion
and conviction when it was first read
but it had told almost nothing

  this mount tannenburg was too
big the area covered by it far too
vast the very peak perhaps was
what had been meant but this much
was certain there could be no false
choices once landing had been
effected the police ships would be
down on them like starving vultures
on carrion provided that is that they
werent shot to pieces on their way
to a landing   

  leclerc stared at the radar screen
covering the surface below them he
noticed that one little spot on the
western slopes of the mountain
glowed more brightly than anything
around it stood out like a spark of
pallid fire in the green-glowing fluo-
rescence he said a little doubtfully
metal

  so what snapped the woman

  i do not know said leclerc slow-
ly if the famous female intuition is
working or not but mine is it seems
to me that one would hardly find 
such a large concentration of pure
metal in nature its existence bespeaks
the artifact and an artifact means in-
telligent beings these shimmering
ghosts of yours are one supposes in-
telligent in their way we will look
for them there

  are you sure leclerc

  no but i am sure that by hanging
here were becoming a temptation to
anybody with a large stock of guided
missiles at his disposal take her
down but fast then   

  all right but im not landing her
well tumble out as fast as we can
and then one of youf youll do fan-
tozzi shes your ship take her and
carry on down the mountain as
though youre looking for something
and once the shooting starts getting
serious ditch her and get the hell
out

  the spurlings nose dipped the
screaming jets in their turret turned
through an arc of ninety degrees the
glimmering speck shifted from the
horizontal screen to the one covering
the forward vertical plane the cloud
surface came up to meet them like a
solid wall-and the sun went out like
a snuffed candle as they plunged into
the mists

  the cabin which had been almost
freezing became uncomfortably warm
there was the thin high whistle c
tortured atmosphere screaming past
and over burnished hull and polished
wing surfaces and there was a great
flare in the fog and a deafening con-
cussion as the first of the police
rockets burst below and to port of
them

  by a miracle no damage was done
down they plunged and down
pressed back in their seats against
the force of gravity then marilyn


out of this world adventures

cut the drive brought the jets round
in their turret to check the mad de-
scent they blasted out again and
the shock burst safety straps and sent
cabin furniture crashing away from
its fastenings the ship leveled off
hovering very perilously on her flam-
ing jets

  marilyn hall jumped up from the
pilots chair ran to the door leclerc
following saw the woman called lisa
fantozzi hastily taking her leaders
place

  he jumped fell to a rough sloping
surface rolled until he was brought
up short by some kind of prickly
bush he heard the noise of the jets
rise in pitch to an angry scream that
sounded almost like that of a living
thing looked around in time to see
their ruddy flare fast fading into the
fog there was a muffled explosion
in the direction in which the spurl-
ing had vanished but the noise of her
drive was not cut short diminished
slowly with increasing distance

  leclerc somebody was calling
leclerc

  here he shouted here mari-
lynt

  well come to you are you all
here

  one by one the girls called their
names

  wheres helen

 there was a short silence then
somebody said i  i think she fell
under the jets   

  leclerc felt more than a little sick
but pulled himself together this was
no time for sentimentality if women
chose to play a dangerous game   

marilyn hall loomed out of

the fog her arms outstretched
he took one of her hands it was
warm and firm an anchor to reality
then two more women appeared one
of them limping badly janet
called marilyn sharply where are
you were waiting

  the reply drifted out of the gray
formlessness around them thin
frightened

 i cant-move-the mists-stop-
ping me   

  leclerc swore he started to run in
the direction of the voice dragging
marilyn with him he tripped and
stumbled on the uneven ground but
somehow kept his feet

 there were no words now coming
out of the fog as a guide no articu-
late words just a high dreadfully
thin whimpering and then he saw
the girl she was standing erect try-
ing to ward something off with in-
effectual hands and around her
swirled a shimmering silvery vapor
formless it was amorphous yet sug-
gestive in its convolutions hinting at
impossibly perfect curves   

  and he felt sudden desire hot ach-
ing desire--and he felt too that the
air was charged with hate the dread-
ful implacable hate of sexual rivalry
and the knowledge of hatred slipped
into the back of his mind and there
was only naked desire   

  almost he forgot that here was a
woman one of his own species in
some unspeakably horrible peril al-
most    but with an effort that left
him weak and shaken he fought down
the imaginings that had come all un-
bidden to his mind fought down the
urges that strove to inhibit the action
his cold intellect demanded

  but he was too late the solid flesh
and blood woman glimmered and
faded glimmered and faded and she
was gone and he never knew if the
silvery tinkling of laughter came
from inside or outside his own brain
the laughter and the sweet high
womans voice saying she is one of
us now    and you-will be ours
and desire came again and in the
shimmering mist clothed in shimmer-
ing mist was the woman alina as he
had seen her before as he had seen
her on the night of her vanishing the
terror of the mist-maidens



same yet not the same her arms
were outstretched and her lips were
slightly parted and her smile could
have been sad but it was sweet sweet
   and there was fulfilment there
and peace and all that a man wants
and all that can never be given in its
entirety by any living woman   

 he started forward he pushed
without comprehension at the barrier
that was holding him from the con-
summation of his desires he felt a
mouth on his warm urgent he felt
a firm body against his own but the
kiss was not what he wanted not that
kiss he fought against it but this
strange desire was even stronger than
his own desire and it was familiar
and against his will mind and body
he started to slip down what was to
him a well-worn path

  and the shimmering mist was just
-a strange shimmering mist and he
was looking into the eyes of marilyn
hall who was standing pressed
against him her arms around him and
on either side he was encircled by the
arms of the other two women

  a man said marilyn bitterly i
thought that you    she left the
sentence unfinished   

  the mists swirled and advanced
hemming them in

 fight muttered the woman
fight damn you the three of us
together might hold it off and you
leclerc no more treachery

  again the air crackled with hos-
tility with bitter naked hate the
tension rose to a pitch so unbearable
that leclerc wanted only to get away
to run somewhere and hide to leave
these rival manifestations of the
female principle to fight it out with-
out his aid or intervention either one
way or the other

  his reason told him that the hu-
man flesh and blood women were
right that they were all the things
for which man has worked and
fought and died throughout the long

long ages of his history home and
family and continuity    and he
couldnt help thinking his chains

  but they stumbled on and before
them through the fog loomed a high
wall of metal it was a ship he real-
ized dimly but her plates were
crumpled and torn the double hull
pierced in a score of places by the
rocks on to which she had crashed
and she was old old and must have
been here since before the first
colonization

  interest conquered emotion and he
raised his eyes to read the worn
tarnished letters of the name but this
helen told him nothing except that
she was from long long before his
time from the days when those who
christened ships had drawn heavily
upon greek mythology

  it is in here said marilyn

  what is asked the man

  i dont    know but i feel some-
how that the answer is here    and
keep close to him you two dont let
him away and keep on fighting

thick and thicker swirled the
mists solid almost yet always
receding before the implacable hatred
of the three slowly advancing
women leclerc deliberately shut his
eyes and the images the shapes of
aching unfulfilled desire were gone
but in his ears still sounded the
voices and every word was a caress
and a promise and he hated the
women who were holding him captive
in the drab gray world that they
alone would rule

  into the ship they went stumbling
over broken plating their uncertain
way lit by a pocket torch that one of
the three had produced they ignored
the tattered formless heaps that had
once been bodies pressed on through
riven bulkheads and over dangerous-
ly sharp-edged wreckage at last they
came to the control room and could
go no further


out of this world adventures

  there was all manner of debris at
their feet and there was a book and
the torch was shining full upon it
by some freak the lettering on its
cover was still legible log of the
interstellar ship helen  read the
girl with th-e torch slowly from-

from fomalhaut viii to sol iii

  so in spite of himself leclerc
was excited his intellect was func-
tioning once more and taking a keen
delight in the way that the pieces of
the puzzle were falling into place
you remember marilyn what i told
you on the way here about the
gaseous entities of fomalhaut viii
i begin to understand

 the mists swirled about them
viciously hostile and their hostility
was no longer only for the women but
also for the man who was now their
ally leclerc stiffened joined the
driving force of his hate to that of
the others and ihated himself for ever
having fallen under the unholy spell
of these creatures of fog and raw
desire he cried

  there is more here in this ship
more much more that they do not
wish us to find and we will find it
where gasped marilyn

  try aft the cargo spaces

  and they fought their way through
the broken ship meeting hate with
hate weakening all the time before
the intensity of the raw emotion that
swirled about them that broke against
them like the waves of some incred-
ibly storm-tormented sea

  they were weak when they found
the cylinders weak and streaming
with perspiration they stared at the
two cylinders with dim unseeing
eyes there was something they had
to do and they did not know what it
was and almost they did not care
they sat there huddled together upon
a ruined bale weakly fighting back
the forces that strove to overwhelm
them

  but still fighting

  we gasped marilyn will keep
them off somehow you leclerc see
what is to fee done  

  secure but how long within the
circle of the arms of the three women
leclerc looked at the seemingly in-
nocent metal containers one was
marked with the symbol of mars the
symbol that has also a biological sig-
nificance the other was marked with
the crux ansata for venus    and
that one was open

 it was nature herself who had
opened it it was the steady dripping
of water through a gap in the torn
hull plating for all of two centuries
that had eroded the tough steel le-
clerc shuddered picturing the hungry
entity-or entities-that had emerged
picturing the nature of that hunger
and the way in which it had been
satisfied   

  he thought of man-eating tigers
back on earth and the legend say-
ing that once the carnivores had
tasted human meat they would touch
no other   

  but whatever was in the unbroken
cylinder had never tasted human
flesh   

  he whispered youll have to let
me go i have to break the other cyl-
inder   

slowly reluctantly the womens
arms fell from him he picked up
a short bar of metal from among the
wreckage raised it to attack the
sealed valve the valve that he could
never open otherwise without the
proper tools and the mists surged in
to the attack and for him they had
abandoned the weapon of hate and it
was the woman alina who was stand-
ing before him and her eyes were
pleading and sorrowful and her smile
was tremulous   

  dont she was saying it will be
murder and worse    and i am hu-
man  i was human and now i can
give you more than ever woman
terror of the mist-maidens



could   her voice trailed off

  he hated the three who still sat on
rne ruined bale-the three coarse
silly women with their ridiculously
strained faces their evil desire to kill
something so much finer than them-
selves he knew that there was only
one thing to do he raised the bar
again but this time it was not the
gas cylinder that he was going to at-
tack

  unafraid even smiling marilyn got
to her feet before he could bring the
bar crashing down upon her coppery
hair her arms were around him my
dear she said this is reality here
in my arms    and it was reality
of a sort and he despised himself for
accepting it as such even while all
his body recognized and acknowl-
edged the urgency of hers

  take the bar he gasped smash
the cylinder

 no you must my darling you
must

  and the naked triumph in that last
sentence was shocking obscene

 with a strangled sob leclerc
pushed himself out of marilyns arms
the glimmering wraith that was
alina stood before the cylinder all
sweet allure all that any woman could
ever be to any man-and more but
the bar drove down through the liv-
ing mist and with the first blow the
valve cracked open with explosive
violence what was inside rushed out
-a shimmering vapor a cloud of glit-
tering particles dreadfully alive and
urgent

  and of that union leclerc remem-
bers little neither leclerc nor any
of the three human women there
was lightning that flared and crackled
all around them there was the thun-
der that brought the searching police
ships down upon them at last it was
a miracle that they survived but sur-
vive they did seared and shaken in

the fused and twisted wreckage of
the ruined ship

 it was marilyn hall who went to
meet the policemen

  she held herself erect arrogantly
stood on the hillside and let the men
come to her they stumbled up over
the rough ground through the fog
that no longer swirled living and
shimmering that was now dead gray
and utterly formless

  you are too late she cried
too late echoed one of the men
what   

  yes she shouted triumphantly
too late to stop one silly cloud of
gas from being annihilated by an-
other even sillier foolsv

  leclerc came out from the wreck-
age pushed past the contemptuous
blatantly exultant woman he grabbed
one of the policemen by the arm he
said get us out o-f here get us back
to the city i cant stand any more
marilyn came and stood beside him
took his arm possessively yes she
said there is no more danger take
us back

 nobody questioned her right to
give orders leclerc felt sorry for the
men of this world for generations
they would pay for the wrong that
they had done the women and for
generations the women would crack
the whip he was very glad that he
did not have to stay here and hoped
with all his heart that he would never
come here again

  it was here that he had been faced
with the choice between shadow and
substance and-

  either way he whispered to him-
self i was doing the wrong thing
marilyn dropped his arm and be-
tween them was a taut injured si-
lence he knew that once the police
plane should have carried them to
the city he would never see her again
and he was not sorry

          are there interplanetary invaders among us today
          thats the question the g-man wanted to investigate
             but the trail was to lead to an undreamed of
          complication and an altogether unexpected conclusion

by mack reynolds

arvey todd
director of the de-
partment of secur-
ity initialed two
papers put them
aside and reached
for another report
he didnt bother to look up wish
youd mate this brief as possible
ross im up to my ears

 chief ross wooley said hesi-
tantly suppose i wanted to investi-
gate something on my own follow
up a hunch

  his superior shot a quizzical look
at the undersized agent what dya
have in mind

  its something screwy the other
answered something thatll sound
like im around the corner

 harvey todd put down his pen and
grinned at his best operative you
must have a lulu this time ross but
your reputations good and your
hunchesve been so far what is it
wooley scratched his chin with a
thumbnail chief he said slowly
not sure how his words would be re-
ceived ive got reasons to suspect
there might be aliens in the united
states

 the department of security head
scowled at him of course therere
aliens here what of it thats not
our jurisdiction

 i mean aliens from space some
other planet maybe

  are you drunk

  no sir

  harvey todd stared at him for a
lo-ng time without saying anything
finally he muttered lets hear it
id like permission to investigate
if i cant have it id like leave of
absence to probe around on my own
if i cant have that ill submit my
resignation so that ill be free to look
into this as a private citizen the
little agents eyes blinked rapidly be-
hind his shell-rimmed glasses

  todd glanced down at the pile of
letters on his desk and sighed he
brushed them aside reached into a
drawer of his desk and brought out
a prehistoric briar and a can of to-
bacco he didnt speak again until the
pipe was filled and lit and he was
leaning back in his chair puffing at
it then he said this seems to mean
quite a bit to you what dya have
the agent stirred uncomfortably
not enough to make sense chief ar
article here a news item there some
quotations from obscure scientists
more hunch than anything else what
id like is enough time to make a pre-
liminary investigation if i get any-
thing definite ill report then its
up to you

 harvey todd let smoke trickle
through his nostrils and squinted
worriedly through it give me more
than that ross i cant assign an
agent to go around searching for


characters out of buck rogers with-
out having some idea of what hes
working on

  you said my reputation was good
wooley reminded him

 todd picked up his pen and
doodled a series of cubes on a pad
before him its bad for the depart-
ment to be held up to ridicule ross
weve been under fire several times
this past year i can think of several
congressmen whod like to know we
assign agents to tail men from mars
then youd prefer my resigna-
tion the dynamic little agents voice
was tight

  his chief grunted disgustedly then
suddenly made up his mind no
damn it make your investigation
but for heavens sake keep it quiet
if it gets into the papers ill have
you counting your toes on alcatraz

before im through with you ross
ross wooley grinned thanks er
   ill have to do some traveling
see smith about it on your way
out now beat it i think youre
crazy harvey todd took up his pen
and another stack of letters sighed
and went back to work

a maid ushered him into the
study he gave the room a quick
once over and gained an impression
of endless shelves of books several
comfortable chairs good lighting
two well-conceived oils on the walls
a small portable bar a scholars room
but at the same time a mans

 professor andre dumar looked up
from his chair with a frown then
squinted at the card in his hand again
mr ross wooley

 thats right the agent turned




out of this world adventures

and looked at the maid she left the
room closing the heavy door behind
her

 sit down mr wooley the pro-
fessor said you dont look the way
hollywood leads us to believe a se-
curity agent does

 ross wooley didnt smile hed
heard the equivalent too often be-
fore my strong point as an opera-
tive professor

 dumar said about thirty years
ago while i was still an undergrad-
uate i recall writing a paper for my
anthropology class entitled primi-
tive communism among the amerin-
dians otherwise i cant think of
anything in my life that would call
for a visit from a department of se-
curity man

 wooley grinned and selected a
chair i came for information pro-
fessor you seem to be an authority
on several obscure subjects sort of
an off trail specialist

 that sounds as though it needs
amplification

  you confine your research to sub-
jects many men of science fearing
ridicule deliberately avoid mental
telepathy and clairvoyance for in-
stance you were a pioneer in their
early study

 the professor nodded actually
out of my line but a fascinating in-
vestigation now the ice is broken
more capable specialists than i are
doing yeoman work in esp

 ross wooley ran his left hand
nervously over his chin before we
go further professor id like you to
understand that no matter how
strange the things i ask you the de-
partment requests that you not dis-
cuss them even with family mem-
bers

 professor dumar scowled and
studied ross wooleys card again
this says youre a government
agent prove it please

 wooley smiled a sensible pre-

caution sir he drew his wallet from
his pocket and held it over for the
others inspection

  the professor went over the cre-
dentials carefully then picked up the
telephone and dialed the operator
give me the department of security
please    hello this is professor
andre dumar here in my study is a
man claiming to be ross wooley
have you an agent of that name   
thank you will you now describe
him thank you very much good-
bye

  the professor returned the wallet
and relaxed in his chair you seem
to be what you claim what are your
questions

  ross wooley framed the first care-
fully professor is there life in the
universe besides that found on
earth

 dumar removed his pince nez
glasses and stared life

  yes alien life

  the scientist considered for a mo-
ment then said slowly we are quite
positive that at least vegetation exists
on mars but its unlikely any of the
other planets have life forms

  how about other star systems
of course the authorities differ
considerably   

  im asking your opinion profes-
sor wooley said

  the other shifted in his chair as
though the agents questions irritated
him given the multitude of stars in
our universe it is likely that the con-
ditions applying in our solar system
are duplicated elsewhere in such
case i should say that life is prob-
ably also duplicated

  intelligent life wooley pur-
sued

  -possibly

  now this is the important ques-
tion professor granting that life
does exist elsewhere could represen-
tatives of it have made their way to
earth
the discord makers



  professor  dumar flicked a finger-
nail against the gold rim of his
glasses who informed you of my
research into this subject he
snapped

  pay dirt the agent breathed then
even more earnestly nobody pro-
fessor it was a strike in the dark
please tell me what you can

 dumar got to his feet and went
over to his portable bar drink he
asked over his shoulder

  no thanks this was the first
break in the investigation the little
agent was stimulated enough without
alcohol

  if you dont mind ill have one
the professor mixed himself whiskey
and water and returned to his chair
he took half of the drink down in a
gulp then launched into his subject

   became aware about three
a years ago that there were unnat-
ural life forms on earth they had
seemingly been here for a lengthy
period but nevertheless something
was wrong about them my first clue
was the fact that they seemed to re-
volt other animals including man
wooley injected how do you
mean revolt

  the professor ran a hand through
his hair in irritation as though it
were difficult to explain take the
spider for instance or the snake
theres an instinctive loathing that
nine out of ten persons feel at the
sight of either i believe its because
we know they dont belong theyre
alien to earth and subconsciously
we realize it and our flesh crawls to
this list you might also add the rat
and the cockroach

 ross wooley scratched his chin
with a thumbnail ive always
thought the fear of the snake and
spider was instinctive handed down
from primitive man theyre poison-
ous after all

  the professor shook his head that

doesnt answer it for one thing few
snakes and fewer spiders are poison-
ous for another its more than just
fear-its absolute revulsion we feel
besides predatory animals killed
more of primitive man than did the
snake or spider why dont we feel
this instinctive fear when we see
lions bears or wolves in addition
youll find we have somewhat the
same loathing though not so strong
for some reason of rats and cock-
roaches though they arent poison-
ous

  the agent grimaced but how did
they get here surely you dont sug-
gest that snakes or spiders or even
rats have the ability to construct
spaceships

  frankly thats been the greatest
obstacle to my theory i have two
possible answers neither quite satis-
fies me

  do you mind explaining them
one possibility is that a spaceship
arrived here a considerable time ago
and crashed the alien life forms it
carried were forced to remain how-
ever the conditions on terra were
different from those on their home
planet and they werent completely
successful in adapting themselves
they degenerated until now they are
on a par with unintelligent life
forms

 ross wooley was unsatisfied
what led you to that theory

  for one thing i note indications
that the rat once held a higher stage
on the scale of evolution youll find
that the rat sometimes decorates its
nest with broken pieces of colored
glass or shiny bits of metal could it
have the remnants of an esthetic
sense

  or the beginning of one wooley
suggested

  possibly im not too strong for
this theory the theory i like best is
that theyre guinea pigs the pro-
fessor said


out of this world adventures

  guinea pigs

  thats right suppose some other
planet wanted room for expansion and
saw earth as a prospective colony
rather than risk unknown diseases
or other deadly possibilities they
would simply land a number of in-
ferior life forms from their planet
if the snake spider and rat could
adapt themselves without harm to
the earth then these aliens could take
over

  ross wooley blinked professor
it seems to me that the weakest point
in these theories of yours is the fact
that these forms of life have been on
earth indefinitely the cockroach for
instance it seems to me ive read
that its one of earths oldest inhab-
itants and all of them snake spider
rat have been here since far back in
the most primitive periods

  dumar sipped his drink thought-
fully we dont know that the aliens
are in any particular hurry they
might be willing to wait hundreds of
thousands of years to be sure earth
is suitable for their species to a
young civilization like ours a few
thousand years seems an endless
time but to a culture that might be
many millions of years in age its a
short period indeed

  then to sum it up you believe
there is other intelligent life in the
universe and that for one reason or
other theyve landed alien life forms
on earth

 the professor nodded thats
about it

the next name took him across
the continent to san francisco
hed have hesitated before expending
the time and money involved if it
hadnt been for the renewed interest
dumar had inspired

  first saying this comes from one
of your recent lectures the agent
took a news clipping from an en-
velope and read aloud m in fact

so chaotic are mans affairs so unbe-
lievable is it he could thus be his own
worst enemy that one is led to be-
lieve aliens from space enemies for
some unknown reason are in our
midst and sabotaging our efforts to-
ward progress   

  wooley looked up i assume the
quotation is correct

  the nationally known lecturer and
commentator in whose office they sat
frowned but nodded substantially
what did you mean by it
morton harrison ran an irritated
hand through his famous snow white
hair i didnt mean anything by it
what in the world are you driving
at

  ross wooley returned the clipping
to his pocket where did you get
the idea that there was a possibility
of aliens from space being in our
midst

  the other began to laugh finally
good heavens man has the depart-
ment of security finally reached the
point where its investigating charac-
ters out of science-fiction that
illustration meant nothing i thought
of it out of a clear sky

  wooley had pulled another blank
he sighed in resignation and leaned
back in his chair all right mr har-
rison but now im here and just for
the record what were you illustrat-
ing when you used that example
the other got to his feet and
flicked his right arm in the gesture
so well known to his audiences un-
thinkingly his voice and movements
took on his platform mannerisms i
was only pointing out that man is his
own enemy to such an extent that it
seems unbelievable

  such as what ross asked

  morton harrison tugged at his right
ear i could give a score of examples
but let me suggest just one or two

  first have you ever noticed that
persons and organizations that strive
for mans advancement are usually
the discord makers



either given the silent treatment or
laughed to scorn take our pacifists
for instance most people think of
them as crackpots theyre made light
of in peace and in times of war
thrown into concentration camps or
jail almost everyone claims he is
against war why then this contempt
for the persons who work hardest to
end it

  ross wooley ran a thumbnail over
his chin reflectively never thought
of it that way he admitted

 let me use another example
harrison continued in this country
we like to speak of our freedoms but
actually there are few nations where
we find more intolerance and persecu-
tion in our southern states the ex-
ample is obvious and throughout the
nation we have anti-semitism but
thats only the beginning on the
west coast we have discrimination
against those of japanese descent in
some areas those of mexican descent
in others in central california there
is discrimination against those of
portuguese descent in the northern
great lakes area the finns are the
butt in the southwest the american
indian

  nor is the practice limited to our
nation when we americans go
abroad we often find cutting indica-
tion that we are scorned disliked
considered pushers and money grab-
bers by other nationalities its
amusing america england france
and the other united nations sneered
at the german and japanese claims
to being supermen herrenvollbut
actually we all practice the same de-
lusion

  wooley stirred as though to pro-
test at least part of the lecture he
was being given but the other held
up a restraining hand and went on

  the point is that instead of en-
couraging and fighting for such things
as the end of war a better social sys-
tem for an end to intolerance and

racial discrimination the average
person is actually led to revile or at
least be disdainful of those who work
to those ends we seem to be delib-
erately fighting against the very
things we want most

  ross wooley returned his notepad
to his pocket and got to his feet i
suppose i see your point i dont agree
with you entirely but at least i get
what you meant in your reference to
visitors from space he held out his
hand to be shaken

he harrison interview had
been disappointing and only one
other name remained on the list hed
compiled he scowled at it not liking
a los angeles address even when the
mans name was followed by a ph d
the city of angels home of the
crackpot he told himself the guyd
probably claim he had a whole cellar
full of martians

  however dr kenneth keith pres-
ident of the western rocket society
and a leading member of a fortean
group was too near not to see ross
wooley took a plane to l a and a
cab to the home of the man who had
written an article on the possibilities
of space travel

  it took him five minutes to convince
mrs keith he wasnt a science-fiction
fan trying to meet the president of
the rocket society for the purpose 
of arguing over the desirability of
using nitric acid and aniline for fuel
instead of nitric acid and vinyl ethyl
in the first moon rocket

  when he finally found himself in
the doctors study he hesitated before
beginning hed had so many rebuffs

  the doctor took the initiative
youre probably here about my
article in which i mentioned the pres-
ence of beings from other planets on
terra

 ross wooley blinked at him
how 

  doctor keith grinned and held hi


out of this world adventures

two hands in an expressive shrug
its been suggested even proven a
score of times its only recently come
to my attention just why the proof
has been ignored and i think it about
time the situation is exposed thats
why i emphasized that although man
is on the verge of discovering space
travel he is not the first to utilize it
wooley leaned forward excitedly
before we go any further you say
that the fact of space travel has been
proven a score of times name one
kenneth keith got to his feet and
strode over to one of the bookcases
that lined the walls he returned with
a volume which he tossed into the lap
of the department of security agent
theres proof he said

  ross wooley took it up eagerly
read the title and then snorted in dis-
gust lo by charles fort

  keith shot a finger out at him
thats what im talking about why
were you disgusted when you saw the
proof i offered

  the little agent tossed the book
contemptuously to a coffee-table
which sat before him im afraid fort
isnt exactly acceptable as proof hes
commonly thought of as a crack   
he stopped suddenly remembering
what morton harrison had told him
those persons who were foremost in
fighting mans battle of progress
were scorned as crackpots nuts
fanatics so was fort

  all right he said im listening
tell me things

  doctor kenneth keith beamed and
launched happily into his subject in
the past century its been established
a score of times that theres travel
to this planet from others fort
among others proves it quite con-
clusively in his books ive been aware
of this for years and ive been
puzzled because the fact hasnt been
widely accepted ive recently found
the reason

  and what is that reason asked

wooley now tensed in expectation

  we who have suspected the exist-
ence of these visitors have always
thought of them as merely that-
visitors most of us supposed they
didnt reveal themselves to us openly
because they thought of man as a
backward creature and not ready for
intercourse with more advanced life
forms

  ross wooley stirred but what is
it youve discovered

  the rocket authority stared serious-
ly into the agents face they arent
visitors theyre conquerors possibly
were already property as charles
fort suggested but im inclined to
think that our potential masters thus
far havent assimilated terra

  ross wooley fingered the skin on
his throat as though hed just fin-
ished shaving and was checking to
find whether hed done a good job
im afraid i dont follow you

  the other jabbed out a finger again
to emphasize his point no con-
queror ever bothers to take over a
worthless desert or an uninhabited
mountain range before its worth ac-
quiring an area it has to be populated
by those you can exploit for hun-
dreds and thousands of years these
aliens have visited terra we werent
ready for conquest as yet but they
were interested in watching us de-
velop along the lines they thought
best sometimes they even helped

  as we finally approached an ad-
vanced civilization they increasingly
took control of our destiny they
wanted us to progress along a certain
route and made sure we did among
other things long after war has be-
come ridiculous they see to it that
we remain warlike they nurture our
superstitions and our intolerances
they keep us divided into nations
classes races different religious
groups

weve finally almost reached the
point where we have space travel our-
the discord makers



selves and its at this period they
grow more evident obviously theyre
about ready to assume their role as
rulers

 but why

  keith jumped to his feet and paced
the room impatiently perhaps they
have bred us for soldiers to be used in
their interplanetary or interstellar
wars perhaps we are to be slaves
all i know is that they are beginning
to take over theyre assuming posi-
tions of power in our governments
our means of communication of news
our educational system in this man-
ner theyve been able to laugh fort
and other far-seeing humans of his
type to scorn

  he broke off his tirade and sat
down again to face the undersized
agent the proof mr wooley is
endless take the recent flying sau-
cers   

harvey todd director of the
department of security finally
looked up from the papers before him
removed his pipe-long since gone
out-from his mouth and said this
is quite a report ross his expres-
sion was quizzical

  the agent had been sitting to one
side nervously fingering his chin
while his chief read the score or more
pages hed typed up yes sir he
said

  id like to have your own summa-
tion since you were the one who se-
cured the material whats your opin-
ion

 ross wooley ran his thumbnail
back and forth over his chin briefly
this sir a helluva long time ago
when earth was in its infancy the
first explorers from other planets
arrived they left various life forms
here from their own world to see
whether they would survive the
snake and spider are examples then
as man evolved they assumed a cer-
tain amount of direction of his de-

velopment the way they directed us
is an indication that they arent ex-
actly benevolent nobody could call it
that never

 weve finally reached a point
where its to their interest to take a
more active part in our affairs i
think theyre on the verge of assimil-
ating us its been suggested that
some of them have already infiltrated
high positions in mans educational
system government and so forth
the chief smiled broadly you
really believe that eh

  ross wooley flushed yes sir he
said stubbornly

  that theres an alien underground
-perhaps i should call it an over-
head since they come from the stars
-working within the framework of
our government

 ross wooley blinked rapidly be-
hind his heavy glasses and nodded
yes sir and i believe that the most
important thing in the world today
is to expose these enemies of the hu-
man race root them out de

 harvey todd interrupted sup-
pose i tell you to drop it that is a
lot of nonsense

  in that case sir id resign from
the department and continue the in-
vestigation on my own

 the department of security head
looked at him for a long moment
finally okay ross sorry he
pressed a button on his desk and a
section of the wall slid back silently
two strangely clad figures stepped
out of the passage behind it they
werent human-not exactly

  the chief eyed his agent laconical-
ly you were right in believing we
of aldebaran-its aldebaran not
mars or venus-have assumed posi-
tions of power in your fantastic earth
governments

  he turned to the first of the strang-
ers who had covered wooley with an
ugly weapon dispose of him in th
usual way


out of this world adventures

 ross wooleys hand streaked for
his left shoulder a pale light
gleamed momentarily he dropped his
gun stiffened and began to slump
forward the two aliens grabbed him
as he fell and began to drag his body
to the passageway

 just a moment harvey todd

called take along this report
therere several names on it thatll
call for a visit from us a professor
dumar and a doctor keith in par-
ticular

  he glanced at the pile of papers on
his desk and sighed now get out of
here im up to my ears in work

the shipwrecked bogey man

      continued from page 

-it was working a low-pitched
muted hum reached his ears and he
watched the bell-like upturned crys-
tal grow brighter and brighter

 the bogey man moved quickly
hands reached toward the apparatus
touched the bars here and there did
many things that to peter had no
meaning he watched the horn fas-
cinated and saw the black bubble
come out and rest and grow the
blackness moved up and around even
in the dark room it was a visible
pulsing thing of utter night then it
grew no more and hung there thats
it marveled peter the ship-the cor-
ridor-and i helped to build-

the door of the room flew open
and his fathers shout crashed into
peters ears he looked up shocked
to see dad framed there in the hall
light but dad too was rigid and
silent watching and then with a
last wild glance peter saw the bogey
man hands over eyes plunge desper-
ately into the hovering black sphere
the glimmering body vanished and
they waited the sphere hung there
motionless and just as motionless
peter and his father stared into the
blackness

 mother was there she had made
no sound and yet was suddenly with
them standing beside dad she

gripped his arm and he looked at
her startled he cursed walked into
the room and then with obvious in-
tent went over to the wall where the
socket was

  peter yelled with fear no dad
no

  his father looked back from his
crouch beside the wall no he
asked in a hard voice why not

  dont begged peter please
dont hes got to get home in a
minute itll collapse just a minute
dad

  his mother reached him and caught
him to her sh    peter she said
and rocked him on her chest no no
she said itll be all right

  please dont he pleaded

  ha snorted dad and he pulled
out the plug-

 there was nothing where the
sphere had been the crystal was
dead the apparatus remained on the
floor of the room lifeless in the hall
light

  dad stood up quietly still staring
into the center of the room mother
held peter tight and ran her hand
over his head

  and peter struggled in misery and
despair to free himself and he shout-
ed with rage at his father youve
done it now youve finished him
youve wrecked him again

	walked into the offi-

	 cers mess after cof-

ee new tird
b vj mate just out of the
jh  academy started to
rise the captain
motioned him back into his seat

after a while the mate asked
have you heard the reports over
space news

the captain poured the coffee into
his saucer no

about johnson earths in a stew
they say its unfair the mate
continued there have been stories
of criminals building up empires we
are dumping the refuse of humanity
on the innocent natives making
others suffer for our mistakes

the law says a man convicted of
a capital crime shall be exiled the
captain said

neville

  yes but to set him down on a
planet whose natives are weak and
defenseless-where he can rule whole
races by his slightest whim-thats
not right

  the purser gave johnson fifteen
days ration they sent him down to
the surface of the planet in an escape
ship

  he got out and stood in the warm
air cursing them they left him there

  murder had been his crime he had
made a clever job of it too he killed
for the love of killing a clueless
murder on a dark night a repeat
performance in a week he struck
again and again senselessly eventu-
ally of course he struck once too
often and his luck ran out

  he had always been far too clever
to underestimate his opponents his
knowledge of human psychology was
flawless he was caught only because


out of this world adventures

fate had dealt a hand off the bottom
of the deck the councilor had ex-
amined his personality and with a
wry smile named the planet most
suited to it

  johnson felt sorry for himself he
stood surveying the planet and fum-
ing against the evil machinations of
a fickle fortune

  it wasnt an unpleasant little planet
on the contrary deep-green forests
and quiet streams made it beautiful
to look at the blue-green heavens
arched high overhead and the air
blew springlike strange orange fruit
gave promise of food

  if it hadnt been for the natives
johnson might have sat down and
starved to death out of sheer pique

  the natives gave him direction
his wrath and pent-up savagery saw
promise of a satisfactory outlet

only one look at the natives as-
sured him of his own superior-
ity they were dwarfed and twisted
he automatically thought of them
as the runts they were skinny
they wore huge vacant moronic
smiles their lips were blubbery but
they were not so repulsive that he
couldnt bring himself to tolerate
them

  they came upon him in numbers
but they were peaceful almost child-
like they ran out of the forest and
danced around him in a joyful cir-
cle they tugged at his shirt and
smiled up at him they capered and
giggled they led him in a graceful
dance back into the forest and di-
rected him gently but firmly toward
their village

  the village wasnt much an ar-
rangement of huts radiating outward
from a huge central structure

  they entered the village in a pas-
toral procession a rustic setting
bucolic natives all that was needed
was the pipes of pan

  johnson began to feel somewhat

satisfied he might even come to en-
joy the experience it offered possi-
bilities he looked at the natives and
he rubbed his huge hairy hands to-
gether in anticipation there would
be rare sport   

  the runts led him straight to the
central building and installed him
there they waited upon him as they
would a king which doubtless they
thought him to be

  there was only one thing that gave
rise to doubts johnson discovered
that one of the runts could speak a
smattering of english that was
proof that someone had come before
him to the planet another exile he
wondered that was the only prob-
able explanation and that conclu-
sion since the man was no longer
in evidence gave him pause how-
ever there was nothing to excite defi-
nite suspicion and he settled down
to wait watchfully for the first overt
act then he intended to demonstrate
conclusively that the runts couldnt
put anything over on him

  for a week he waited and during
that time he lived regally

  he was careful of his temper at
the end of that time however there
was a minor incident the natives did
not seem to resent it

  he had boxed the ears of a servant
girl she had only smiled vacantly
back at him and licked her lips later
he noticed that she had walked proud-
ly through the village as if it were
a sign of honor rather than a mark
of abuse

  then the next day one of the
runts in bringing him water had
spilled some across his naked chest
the water was icy and in a moment
of passion he broke the natives arm
the runt had whined a little and
slunk off trailing the arm

  johnson had waited then for an
attack that he felt sure must come
none came life in the village con-
tinued its even tenor he spent a
forbidden fruit



nervous night over it but the next
morning the runt was back his arm
in a sling and the complacent smile
back on his face

  he cursed the runt savagely for
an idiot but the runt only smiled

  johnson licked his lips and decided
definitely that he was going to enjoy
staying with these considerate people
but still he was uneasy things
didnt fit

  he could feel a sense of rising re-
sentment within the runts he
thought he saw hatred in their eyes
but they never moved against him
they served him uncomplainingly and
seemed unduly solicitous of his wel-
fare

the night of the feast however
it was different all his servants
left him for the ceremonies and al-
though he stormed at them from his
hutto cut out that infernal damn
racket so a man can get some sleep
they ignored him completely the
celebrations continued far into the
night and the smell of burning flesh
was sickening

  johnson was usually an astute and
careful observer he was however on
this occasion lulled into a sense of
security he saw nothing dangerous
in the feast and he deduced nothing
from it

  until now he had never seen the
natives eat anything but fruit and
the fact that the carcass the hunt-
ing party dragged into the village
had obviously been dead several days
in the sun meant nothing to him
from it he might have deduced a very
significant fact that they had not
killed the animal but had found it
dead he could have concluded fur-
ther that the runts would not kill for
food the conclusion would have
been valid their religion prohibited
it

  he would have noticed too had he
considered the feast of more conse-

quence that one of the hunters-the
one who had been injured in retriev-
ing the carcass from a swamp-was
given first selection of meat and that
this first selection seemed to be con-
sidered an honor

  all he did notice was that the whole
affair was a savage orgy that turned
even his stomach and he was glad
when the last glowing coal sputtered
out and the villagers crept to their
huts

  the feast did serve to highlight one
fact however johnson realized it the
next morning his rations were low
so far he had avoided eating any of
the native produce but now such a
course was no longer possible he
would have to start living off of the
land

  and recalling the sight of the dead
animal last evening he decided to
try fruit until he could organize a
hunting party to bring in fresh meat

  he searched out the native who
could speak english and led him back
to his hut

  food he demanded imperiously

  the native continued to stare va-
cantly

  he repeated the word louder

  the native bobbed his head up and
down and made no move

  johnson restrained his temper he
made motions toward his mouth and
went through the process of chewing

  the runt brightened ah   
whooood he scurried off

  in anticipation johnson allowed
himself one of his few remaining
cigarettes while he waited

  he did not have to wait long the
native returned with a woven plat-
ter on the platter were two ripe
orange fruit

  they looked appetizing he reached
out for one of them the runt smiled

  johnson stopped his hand in mid-
motion

  the native frowned

 johnson drew back his hand


out of this world adventures

puzzled by the natives reaction

  before him were two pulpy fruit
as near as he could tell they were
both the same still it was obvious
that the native felt they were not

  he reached for the other one and
the runt howled noooo

  johnson hesitated he turned the
matter over in his mind

there was something the matter
with one of the things before him

  he cut them open on the inside
one of them had a bluish tint he
pointed to it

  the native said noooo

  johnson ordered more of the fruit
it took him some time to make the
native understand

  finally he got two more he cut
them he pointed to the one with the
bluish tint

  the runt said no again

  johnson looked at the runt nar-
rowly

  he could not understand why they
had given him a choice that was
something he would never under-
stand it involved a concept alien to
him being as it was the product of
a culture where killing under any cir-
cumstance was unthinkable

  although he could not understand
why they gave him a choice he un-
derstood nevertheless why they
would want to poison him there
was an idea planted in fertile soil

  he smiled grimly he handed the
runt a piece of the bluish tinted fruit
he motioned that the native should
eat it

  the native ate it still smiling he
then pointed to the rest and to john-
son he made a twisted face and simu-
lated agony

  johnson got the idea the runt was
unaffected by it but he could not ex-
pect the same results

  then johnson executed his master-
stroke he thrust the untinted fruit
at the native the runt ate it with
evident satisfaction

  the runt wiped his lips and smiled
up at him johnson hit him in the face

two days later johnson was
hungry he had tramped the for-
est in search of game he had found
none his rations were gone finally
he had to face the situation squarely

  there was food plenty of it it was
all around him and ever at his elbow
a runt to smile or frown he knew
that the runts could tell which food
would poison him perhaps because
of previous experiences with his race
and he knew that in the last analy-
sis he would have to judge from their
reactions to judge falsely would
mean death

  he grew irritable he struck out
petulantly at any runt who came near
him they suffered his ill humor in
silence he knew that their hatred
grew

  this it occurred to him was not
all to his disadvantage in fact it was
the only way by which he could dis-
cover the truth they were a simple
people and if he fanned the fires that
smoldered in them if he made them
hate him enough they would surely
suggest the poison fruit to him thus
by acting contrary to their recom-
mendation he would eat the non-poi-
sonous johnson chuckled and told
himself once more that he was very
clever indeed

  he committed a senselessly brutal
act in public when he was certain that
all would see him he smiled while
he did it and he smiled when he felt
their hatred swirl around him as al-
most a physical force

 then he summoned the natives
around him they came sullenly he
thought he stood on the platform by
his hut he made a series of suitable
gestures

  he held up the bluish-tinted fruit
the crowd pressed closer slowly
their faces changed slowly a nega-
tive howl grew out of them
forbidden fruit



  he held up the other fruit their
faces were transformed by smiles

 there could be no doubt about
which one they wanted him to eat

 he stepped down from the plat-
form he entered his hut the crowd
pressed close around the hut watch-
ing

  very deliberately he lifted the
bluish-tinted fruit to his mouth they
howled and twisted their faces in
pain

  he studied them and he knew that
they hated him as he hesitated they
increased the tempo of their horrible
pantomime they gnashed their teeth
and rolled in the dirt they howled
and screamed

  there was no doubt now in his
mind he bit into the bluish fruit
he imagined their chagrin the first
taste was delicious then he was

twisted in the agony that the runts
had so forcefully predicted he fell
to the ground and writhed the runts
were quiet now having done every-
thing they could to save his life they
waited expectantly for his death
morally they were blameless

  that night the natives had another
feast perhaps it was even more sav-
age than the last the girl who was
slapped the man with the broken
arm and the man with the empty
gaping eye socket were all highly
honored they got first choice to
them the delicacies

  it was a night of merry-making
and at its conclusion the whole vil-
lage sent up a prayer to their alien
gods to send them more animals who
were so stupid that they obligingly
killed themselves in spite of all urg-
ing to the contrary

the planet-smashers

    continued from page 

knife was in her hand i tried to seize
it as the martians blows knocked me
backward but suddenly there were
other shouts looming figures in the
gloom rushing us engulfing us

  i was able to fire once-futile shot
that struck the deck-ceiling and show-
ered us with its colored sparks then
i fell with men on top of me pinning
me down and i had a glimpse of
diannes white face as she stood with
her captors gripping her

  we were caught

chapter vii
suicide earthman

they pulled me to my feet
then timko was here facing me
so the earthman thinks he is so
clever  he stared at me grimly as he
added it is well for you that the
zar-tor wants hostages

  he turned to one of the men grip-
ping me put him in the lock room

meegar keep your weapon muzzle
on him from now to venta or your
life will pay for it

  i understand the burly scowl-
ing meegar glared at me dug his gun
into my ribs with an extra prod you
come with me

  the steel-barred door to the eq-
prison cell was here near at hand
take the girl to the salon with the
passengers timko commanded

  there was just an instant as the
excited martians moved away when
dianne was able to whisper

  jac my heat-gun i hid it in the
deck scupper- they shoved her past
me as meegar roughly pushed me to
the cell door he thrust me in the
door clanked and locked after me
through the lattice of bars his wide-
shouldered figure was a silhouette
with the deck glow behind him then
his face close against the bars glared
in at me


out of this world adventures

  you heard him earthman my gun
is on you

  the prison room had this single
door and a single window its glassite
pane covered on the inside with a lat-
tice of steel bars like the door there
was a small chair and a narrow bunk
the room was unlighted with only
the deck glow and starlight now fil-
tering in the window

  i slumped and sat on the side of
the bed trying to think what i could
do

  im hungry i said am i going
to be here all these last hours-no
food or drink

  timko will send them meegar
growled through the door bars save
your breath earthman

for me it was a long despairing
eternity as i sat there on the bed
idly watching the starlight at the
barred window the bars cast long
shadows on the floor a black barred
pattern then the starlight was gone
as the eq- dropped down through
the atmosphere for another stop

  at my door meegar hardly moved
there was just his silhouette with
his gun-muzzle pointing in now
with the letdown of this hopeless im-
prisonment i realized how tired i
was i sat watching the window-
the starlight gone the mist of the
atmosphere then the dimness of an
air-run out there and the colored
sheen of festival lights    another
bomb detonator being taken off   

  we were up in the starlight again
in a few moments with another in-
terminable interval    another brief
stop as the dark details of this grim
and terrible voyage proceeded so
smoothly   

  i tell you im hungry meegar i
am a hostage you heard tor-timko
say it go tell them i want food and
drink

  he hardly stirred it will come

  it came at last i was desperately

tense again i was unarmed they had
searched me and taken my gun be-
fore they thrust me in here but now
when the cell door opened and the
food came-perhaps i could jump
them

  i had no chance even for a wild
plan meegars weapon backed me to
the window before another crewman
opened the bars and thrust in the
food and drink

 there it is earthman enjoy
yourself

  i sat eating and drinking while the
eq- made another stop for a mo-
ment i stood at the window the fes-
tival was on the other side of the
ship here but its riot of color bright-
ened the little air-run and i saw the
cylinder taken out and the black-
cloaked agent slinking away with it

  they had changed the guard at my
door now like meegar this fellow
stood silent with his gun alert

  whats your name i said

  jarrok hold your tongue

  i finished my meal for a time i
slumped on the bed   

  i knew that i had slept i opened
my eyes nothing had changed star-
light was at the window the guard
jarrok was standing motionless out-
side the barred door as i stirred his
gun rose how long had i slept i
only knew i was refreshed with my
mind sharpened so that all at once
i was thinking things that made my
heart race with a last wildly desper-
ate hope

  a way to die quickly perhaps   
but i had to try it   

  i lay pondering fully awake now
every instant more tense and alert
than i sat up

  is that you jarrok i mumbled
i-i guess i slept where are we

 next we stop at menling he
growled

  good i said soon this voyage
will be over menling was on merid-
ian  on the equator differing
do you make these

mistakes in english

           sherwin codys remarkable invention has enabled more than
            people to correct their mistakes in english only 
           minutes a day required to improve your speech and writing

many persons use such ex-
pressions as leave them
lay there and mary was
invited as well as myself still
others say between you and i
instead of between you and me
it is astonishing how often who
is used for whom and how fre-
quently we hear such glaring mis-
pronunciations as for mid able
ave noo and kew pon few
know whether to spell certain
words with one or two cs or
ms or rs or with ie or
ei and when to use commas in
order to make their meaning ab-
solutely clear most persons use
only common words - colorless
flat ordinary their speech and
their letters are lifeless monoto-
nous humdrum

why most people make

mistakes

  what is the reason so many of
us are deficient in the use of eng-
lish and find our careers stunted
in consequence why is it some
cannot spell correctly and others
cannot punctuate why do so
many find themselves at a loss
for words to express their mean-
ing adequately the reason for
the deficiency is clear sherwin
cody discovered it in scientific
tests which he gave thousands of
times most persona do not write
and speak good english simply be-
cause they never formed the habit
of doing so

what cody did at gary

  the formation of any habit
comes only from constant prac-
tice shakespeare you may be
sure never studied rules no one
who writes and speaks correctly
thinks of rules when he is doing so

  here is our mother-tongue a
language that has built up our
civilization and without which
we should all still be muttering
savages yet some schools by
wrong methods have made it a
study to bo avoided-the hardest
of tasks instead of the most
fascinating of gamesl for years
it has been a crying disgrace

   in that point lies the real differ-
ence between sherwin cody and
theso schools here is an illustra-
tion some years ago mr cody

sherwin cody

was invited by the author of the
famous gary system of educa-
tion to teach english to all upper-
grade pupils in gary indiana by
means of unique practice exer-
cises mr cody secured more im-
provement in these pupils in five
weeks than previously had been
obtained by similar pupils in two
years under old methods there
was no guesswork about these re-
sults they were proved by scien-
tific comparisons amazing as this
improvement was more interest-
ing still was the fact that the
children were wild about the
study it was like playing a game

  the basic principle of mr
codys new method is habit-form-
ing anyone can learn to write
and speak correctly by constantly
using the correct forms but how
is one to know in each case what
is correct mr cody solves this
problem in a simple unique sensi-
ble way



self-correcting device

  suppose he himself were
standing forever at your el-
bow every time you mis-
pronounced or misspelled a
word every time you vio-
lated correct grammatical
usage every time you used
the wrong word to express
what you meant suppose
you could hear him whis-

per that is wrong it should be
thus and so in a short time you
would habitually use the correct
form and the right words in
speaking and writing

  if you continued to make the
same mistakes over and over
again each time patiently he
would tell you what was right he
would as it were be an everlast-
ing mentor beside you-a mentor
who would not laugh at you but
who would on the contrary sup-
port and hej you the  self-
correcting device does exactly
this thing it is mr codys silent
voice behind you ready to speak
out whenever you commit an er-
ror it finds your mistakes and
concentrates on them you do not
need to study anything you al-
ready know there are no rules
to memorize

 free-book on english

codya new method and of what his

from earth which changes from one
day to the next at meridian  on
venus the change is made in the zone
between menling and venta-the
festival-midnight now at menling
and two hours later midnight of the
following night at venta

  i slumped back on the bed my best
chance would be just after we left
menling timko would be up in the
control room then

at menling the private air-run
was dim like the others i stood
grimly at the window as the last det-
onator cylinder was taken away-
twelve of them now with only the
futile opposition dianne and i had
so briefly offered the monstrous
martian plot was completed a ring
of planted triggered atom bombs of
monstrous power thirty degrees of
longitude apart studded the venus
equator

 two hours from now again the
eq- would be at venta an hour
after that the simultaneously timed
bombs would detonate-the titan dag-
ger thrusts at its core splitting the
planet apart the sudden end of a
world   

  the glaring dazzling radiance of
the scarlet festival beamed in my
window as the eq- rose from the
air-run it was a thicket grove here
at menling-a spreading fairyland of
flowered thickets in which the white
princess and her girls were dancing
in the darkness high overhead a bal-
loon platform was poised wholly con-
cealed by the black shadow-beam upon
it

  now at the festival climax from
the invisible platform the scarlet
princess and a horde of her girls were
leaping into the air with blood-red
little parachutes opening and sway-
ing above them they came fluttering
down the thousand-foot drop    scar-
let moths fluttering in the flood-
lights from below    landing and

with flame-hair flying rushing to
battle 

  the gay sensuous scene dropped
away grimly i turned from the win-
dow faced with my desperate reality

	  my last wild hope

  jarrok jarrok have you poisoned
me oh-

  i suddenly slumped in the center
of the room i was clutching at my
middle groaning

  what is it earthman whats the
matter

  that food-that drink- i stag-
gered to the bed sat down killed
me i groaned you fools-fools-
if only you knew-

  jarrok s call brought another crew-
man somethings the matter with
the earthman

  bring timko i gasped no get
me to him i tell you-if i die- get
me to timko i tell you-carry me
-help me-

  they were startled hes sick he
thinks hes poisoned

  thats impossible timko said to
guard his life

 yes important the zar-tor
wants him for hostage

  they were confused in doubt what
they should do with a prayer that
i could convince them i made my
stricken plight sound as urgent as i
dared

  timko get me to timko there
is something i must tell him oh i
cannot die with a secret like that
locked in my mind-the great zar-
tor himself would want to hear it

  they had unlocked the bars of the
door i sat slumped groaning ignor-
ing it oh help me take me-to
timko-

  surely they had to think it best
not to take the responsibility here 

  hold him bahl if he can walk
help him jarrok stood back with
his gun-muzzle pointing at me he
says some secret-wed better take
him quickly-

out of this world adventures

 an earth plot i said when
the zar-tor finds out- suddenly
i was erect stiff and tense and steady
my hand steady as i held it at my hip
with the muzzle of my gun covering
the martian leader dont move
timko my life is gone what do i
care so long as you die first

  i ripped it out and surely it car-
ried conviction for i meant it

 why-why- timko recoiled his
arms spread wide over his head
dont dont kill me-

  my gaze flicked just for a second
on the other men timko dies an
instant quicker than you can kill me
i snapped do you doubt it timko
tell them-

  oh i had gauged him right this
craven fellow i could see the color
fading under the cosmetics of his
cheeks

  tell them to drop their weapons
timko

  bahl jarrok do as he says
their guns clanked to the grid my
words and timkos faltering agree-
ment backed them into a corner of the
control room at the levers the young
pilot stood frozen

  lock the levers get out of here
i told the pilot go below tell the
crew this suicide earthman is in
charge i expect to die but there will
never be a second but that your lead-
er will die first you believe that
dont you timko tell them all

rphe death of a world millions
of people of what importance
was a death or a life here but there
was a difference to timko certainly
he had envisaged the death of venus
without quailing when his own es-
cape had seemed assured

 do what he says timko gasped
i jerked my head at jarrok and
bahl you two go with the pilot
go to the salon send the sirrata
dianne up here at once youll die
with my heat-flash through your

heart timko if she is not here un-
harmed in sixty secoms

 s-send her timko murmured
send her

  and you three-you tell your men
if the engines falter timko will die
and ill plunge the ship death for us
all i called it after them grimly as
they dashed away

  timko and i were left alone take
the levers timko stand with your
back to me

  as he obeyed i snapped down the
blinds of the windows and in a mo-
ment dianne was here white-faced
and grim but her eyes were gleaming
as she mutley gazed at me inquir-
ingly

  lock up the radio room dianne
pull down its blinds leave the con-
necting door open

  she hastened to do it i slammed
the control door locked it we were
barricaded in here i handed timko
the engine room communication tube

  tell your men at the engines that
if anything goes wrong i will crash
the ship tell them timko

  he told them and were flying to
venta on the regular course i said
tell them to stand by for your land-
ing signals or we will crash

  my muzzle was at his back as he
commanded the engine crew

  the radio sender dianne said
you want me to-

  yes of course i knew dianne
could operate the sender she had one
of her own her hobby on the unoffi-
cial length at home in the embassy
call your father dianne then get
him on the audiphone if you can
tell him everything have the cities
searched for the bombs-whatever
can be done-

  yes yes jac i understand
and have the venus police board
us at venta

  i prodded timkos back as i stood
close beside him land us skillfully
timko if i drill you we would crash

that would be too bad wouldnt it
im watching the flight indicators
dont let us leave our course

 dianne was at the radio-sender
snapping out the call then presently
she had voice connection i could
hear her tense swift voice as she was
talking with her father then she
came back to the control room her
grim strained face was pallid

  i could envisage the frantic activ-
ity in the embassy the calls to the
various cities with desperate hunt-
ing for the hidden bombs the search
starting now in venta itself for the
bomb there

of the fatal voyage with my gun
against him timko stood mute
swinging the levers watching the in-
dicators with terror that some error
would creep in but i saw they were
running true at correct altitude and
speed we clung to the doomed plan-
ets equator

  the engines did not fail well did
the brigands down below realize that
they could not trifle with me and at
intervals with shaking voice timko
reminded them   

 then timko was ringing the sig-
nals the jet-streams ceased the pro-
pellers and copters came on with the
starlight obscured now as we dropped
down through the heavy cloud-mists
of the venus atmosphere

  the blue-water grove was dark and
silent now this midnight of the day
after the festival but the air-run
glared with lights and searchbeams
darted up and clung to us in its dis-
tant rack i could see the eq- ready
to start on its alternating flight but
of course the run had now been can-
celled

  the air-run was dotted with dark
figures as we settled into place be-

sistance as the venus police swarmed
aboard

only an hour left now the ter-
rible moments of that last desper-
ate hour are blurred in my memory

dianne was taken to the embassy
but for a time i lingered at the air-
run doing what i could

it was so horribly little futilely
we sent out the two photos she had
taken and the martian agents in
carolah and mizrah were hunted

only an hour    then half an
hour it seemed that two or three of
the bombs had been found and nulli-
fied but so many were left it could
make little difference

and now only fifteen minutes re-
mained to us the end of the world

   the sure presage of it was here
everywhere around me now-the
white faces of the scurrying officials
the rings and buzzing of the com-
munication instruments    the ter-
rified cries of the milling crowds of
people thronging the streets dazed
with their doom upon them

there had been some official talk
that some of us might escape in a
space-flyer-that the rocket-ship of
the brigands might be found and used

   all that came to nothing the       

swift-flying minutes went by and lonely why be lonely

suddenly everyone realized that now
there was no time to do anything

ten minutes left    dianne   

dianne  i found myself murmur-	diamond circle

ing her name    there was nothin box  dept sg

  dianne darling   

  we crouched on the floor holding
each other    dazed and blurred   

 through our closed eyelids the
glare was dazzling  i know now
that in that instant the whole of the
planet was bathed with that white
glare    the blast and roar of the
concussion was monstrous   

 with a dim and puzzled wonder-
ment i held dianne  i was still
alive  i saw the venta detona-
tion then through the great glassite
window at the end of the foyer-a
monstrous jet of upflung gases con-
centrated to be like a titan sword-
thrust knifing up through the atmos-
phere hurtling out into space

  and we were still alive with only
a litter here in the room and the
winds outside tumbling like a crazy
storm

 dazed i was murmuring the
bomb-thrusts-not downward-harm-
lessly upward   

  now dianne was babbling i tried
to do it-i wasnt sure-i just
hoped-

 it was what she had so tried
to tell me but always something had
interrupted that brief moment when
before the eq- had reached caro-
lah dianne had been alone in the
cage-room with the detonators she
had managed to reverse the direc-
tional indicators so that the titan
thrusts of the great bombs had not
been downward to split the planet
but harmlessly upward into space

  concentrated beams of the radioac-
tive gases so swiftly rising that only
far above the venus atmosphere could
they mushroom out lost and gone
the monstrous martian plot to smash
a world had passed into grim and
gruesome memory

  i crouched still dazed holding the
shuddering dianne it is good to hold
the one you love in your arms with
the knowledge that life and happiness
lie ahead of you

continued from page 

sat molding it idly while his eyes
remained unfocused on the shelf be-
fore him now earth was faint in the
distance with mars looming up large
and red before them but he was less
certain than before of what awaited
him there sanctuary or slavery-he
could not tell somewhere within the
notes before him must lie the answer
but his mind went on pacing an end-
less circle unable to break from the
ruts it had worn and the key eluded
him

 when he began his manuscript a
week before it had seemed so simple
and the ink and candle were still there
to remind him of the plan among men
it might have worked but even hu-
man motives were uncertain and
these strange men from mars were of
another race he had mixed with
them supped with their quiet com-
mander and listened to the tales of
mars that jaluir told so well but he
did not know them nor could he hope
to before his children were old
enough to curse or bless him for the
outcome and that would be too late

  with a sudden sweep of his arm he
knocked the things from the shelf
into a trash container and swung
around-just in time to see one of the
side doors swing open quietly and
an old and familiar figure slip from be-
hind it

 gram

 naturally who else would spend
twelve days watching you through a
one-way mirror to see whether she
had a fool for a grandson  but the
strain in her voice ruined the attempt
at humor and she gave it up i found
the candle in your bag omega and
i knew youd find other ways if i de-
stroyed it so i made an agreement
with jaluir and my stuff was on the
plane when you awoke    and yet

at the end i wouldnt have saved you
if theres any difference id rather
see my descendants slaves than cow-
ards 

  omega shook his head dully it
wasnt suicide gram i thought they
might dump me and my no-tes at once
if they were slavers like the man in
your story who tried to cover up and
escape punishment for carelessness
or if they were friends theyd wait
until they read my notes and found
out how to revive me

  umm and youd have no responsi-
bility either way eh no boy men
could have colonized the planets ten
years before the cataclysm but they
were too busy with their fears until
the last minute they were so afraid
of war that all they could do was pre-
pare for it and nothing else the
survivors could have found ways to
get to all the valleys and multiply
again but they gave up and sat blub-
bering about the dirty trick fate
played on them weve been a race
of irresponsible sniveling brats and
now its time we grew up out of
our nightmares and accepted our re-
sponsibilties

 gram shrugged dismissing the
subject and turned toward the door-
way to the hall come on boy jaluir
says were almost there and we might
as well see what it looks like

  but omega could not dismiss the
subject so readily it was good to have
her old familiar strength beside him
but in the final analysis she could not
help the decision he had been forced
to make was his responsibility and no
other could share it men had had
their faults and they were great ones
they had come up too fast and their
cleverness had outstripped their wis-
dom but no single individual could
deny the race one more chance for the
good that was in it

  three centuries of bitter hiberna-
tion had burned away some of their
childhood and they could start anew
