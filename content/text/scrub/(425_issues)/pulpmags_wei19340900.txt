	death strikes a king

the king of vendhya was dying
through the hot stifling night the
temple gongs boomed and the
jconchs roared their clamor was a faint

     

echo in the gold-domed chamber where
bunda chand struggled on the velvet-
cushioned dais beads of sweat glistened
on his dark skin his fingers twisted the
gold-worked fabric beneath him he was
the people of the black circle



young no spear had touched him no
poison lurked in his wine but his veins
stood out like blue cords on his temples
and his eyes dilated with the nearness of
death trembling slave-girls knelt at the
foot of the dais and leaning down to him
watching him with passionate intensity
was his sister the devi yasmina with
her was the wazam a noble grown old in
the royal court

  she threw up her head in a gusty ges-
ture of wrath and despair as the thunder
of the distant drums reached her ears

  the priests and their clamor she
exclaimed they are no wiser than the
leeches who are helpless nay he dies
and none can say why he is dying now
-and i stand here helpless who would
burn the whole city and spill the blood of
thousands to save him

  not a man of ayodhya but would die
in his place if it might be devi an-
swered the wazam this poison-

  i tell you it is not poison she cried
since his birth he has been guarded so
closely that the cleverest poisoners of the
east could not reach him five skulls
bleaching on the tower of the kites can
testify to attempts which were made--
and which failed as you well know
there are ten men and ten women whose
sole duty is to taste his food and wine
and fifty armed warriors guard his cham-
ber as they guard it now no it is not
poison it is sorcery-black ghastly

magic-

  she ceased as the king spoke his livid
lips did not move and there was no rec-
ognition in his glassy eyes but his voice
rose in an eery call indistinct and far
away as if he called to her from beyond
vast wind-blown gulfs

  yasmina yasmina my sister where
are you i can not find you all is dark-
ness and the roaring of great winds
brother cried yasmina catching his

 robert i howards spectacular and
original here conan the barbarian ad-
venturer and fighting-man has cap-
tured the faney of our readers by his
brilliant exploits and his utter human-
ness he has seised the place in popu-
lar esteem that was formerly held by
mr howards earlier heroes solomon
kane the english puritan and king
kull of the fabled land of yaliisia
rough and at times uncouth conan is
a primitive man wh will brave almost
certain death against terrific odds to
rescue a damsel in distress yet he will
just as quickly give her a resounding
slap on the posterior or drop her into
a cesspool if she displeases him but
rude though he is he possesses a sort of
primordial chivalry and an innafe rev-
erence for womanhood that make him
wholly fascinating fighting stabbing
dealing swift death in red combat
conan is a truly striking and heroic
figure we are pleased to present him
herewith for the first time in a novel-
length story the people of the black
circle

limp hand in a convulsive grasp i am

here do you not know me--

  her voice died at the utter vacancy of
his face a low confused moaning waned
from his mouth the slave-girls at the
foot of the dais whimpered with fear
and yasmina beat her breast in her an-
guish

in another part of the city a man
stood in a latticed balcony overlooking
a long street in which torches tossed lurid-
ly smokily revealing upturned dark faces
and the whites of gleaming eyes a
long-drawn wailing rose from the mul-
titude

  the man shrugged his broad shoulders


weird tales

and turned back into the arabesqued
chamber he was a tall man compactly
built and richly clad

  the king is not yet dead but the
dirge is sounded he said to another
man who sat cross-legged on a mat in a
corner this man was clad in a brown
camel-hair robe and sandals and a green
turban was on his head his expression
was tranquil his gaze impersonal

  the people know he will never see
another dawn this man answered

  the first speaker favored him with a
long searching stare

  what i can not understand he said
is why i have had to wait so long for
your masters to strike if they have slain
the king now why could they not have
slain him months ago

  even the arts you call sorcery are gov-
erned by cosmic laws answered the man
in the green turban the stars direct
these actions as in other affairs not
even my masters can alter the stars not
until the heavens were in the proper or-
der could they perform this necromancy
with a long stained finger-nail he
mapped the constellations on the mar-
ble-tiled floor the slant of the moon
presaged evil for the king of vendhya
the stars are in turmoil the serpent in
the house of the elephant during such
juxtaposition the invisible guardians are
removed from the spirit of bhunda
chand a path is opened in the unseen
realms and once a point of contact was
established mighty powers were put in
jsiay along that path

  point of contact inquired the other
do you mean that lock of bhunda
glands hair

  yes all discarded portions of the
human body still remain part of it at-
tached to it by intangible connections
the priests of asura have a dim inkling
of this truth and so all nail-trimmings

hair and other waste products of the per-
sons of the royal family are carefully re-
duced to ashes and the ashes hidden but
at the urgent entreaty of the princess of
khosala who loved bhunda chand vain-
ly he gave her a lock of his long black
hair as a token of remembrance when
my masters decided upon his doom the
lock in its golden jewel-crusted case
was stolen from under her pillow while
she slept and another substituted so like
the first that she never knew the differ-
ence then the genuine lock travelled
by camel-caravan up the long long road
to peshkhauri thence up the zhaibar
pass until it reached the hands of those
for whom it was intended

  only a lock of hair murmured the
nobleman

  by which a soul is drawn from its
body and across gulfs of echoing space
returned the man on the mat

  the nobleman studied him curiously
i do not know if you are a man or a
demon khemsa he said at last few
of us are what we seem i whom the
kshatriyas know as kerim shah a prince
from iranistan am no greater a masquer-
ader than most men they are all traitors
in one way or another and half of them
know not whom they serve there at
least i have no doubts for i serve king
yezdigerd of turan

  and i the black seers of yimsha
said khemsa and my masters are great-
er than yours for they have accomplished
by their arts what yezdigerd could not
with a hundred thousand swords

outside the moan of the tortured
thousands shuddered up to the stars
which crusted the sweating vendhyan
night and the conchs bellowed like oxea
in pain

   in the gardens of the palace the torches
glinted on polished helmets and curved
the people of the black circle



swords and gold-chased corselets all
the noble-born fighting-men of ayodhya
were gathered in the great palace or about
it and at each broad-arched gate and door
fifty archers stood on guard with bows
in their hands but death stalked through
the royal palace and none could stay his
ghostly tread

  on the dais under the golden dome the
king cried out again racked by awful
paroxysms again his voice came faintly
and far away and again the devi bent
to him trembling with a fear that was
darker than the terror of death

  yasmina again that far weirdly
dreeing cry from realms immeasurable
aid me i am far from my mortal
house wizards have drawn my soul
through the wind-blown darkness they
seek to sap the silver cord that binds me
to my dying body they cluster around
me their hands are taloned their eyes
are red like flame burning in darkness
aie save me my sister their fingers
sear me like fire they would slay my
body and damn my soul what is this
they bring before me-ate

  at the terror in his hopeless cry yas-
mina screamed uncontrollably and threw
herself bodily upon him in the abandon
of her anguish he was tom by a terri-
ble convulsion foam flew from his con-
torted lips and his writhing fingers left
their marks on the girls shoulders but
the glassy blankness passed from his eyes
like smoke blown from a fire and he
looked up at his sister with recognition

  brother she sobbed brother-

  swift he gasped and his weakening
voice was rational i know now what
brings me to the pyre i have been on a
far journey and i understand i have
been ensorceled by the wizards of the
himelians they drew my soul out of
my body and far away into a stone room
there they strove to break the silver cord

of life and thrust my soul into the body
of a foul night-weird their sorcery sum-
moned up from hell ah i feel their
pull upon me now your cry and the
grip of your fingers brought me back
but i am going fast my soul clings to
my body but its hold weakens quick-
kill me before they can trap my soul for
ever

  i can not she wailed smiting her
naked breasts

  swiftly i command you there was
the old imperious note in his failing whis-
per you have never disobeyed me-
obey my last command send my soul
clean to asura haste lest you damn
me to spend eternity as a filthy gaunt of
darkness strike i command you strike

  sobbing wildly yasmina plucked a
jeweled dagger from her girdle and
plunged it to the hilt in his breast he
stiffened and then went limp a grim
smile curving his dead lips yasmina
hurled herself face-down on the rush-
covered floor beating the reeds with her
clenched hands outside the gongs and
conchs brayed and thundered and the
priests gashed themselves with copper
knives

	a barbarian from the hills

chunder shan governor of pesh-
khauri laid down his golden pen
and carefully scanned that which he had
written on parchment that bore his offi-
cial seal he had ruled peshkhauri so
long only because he weighed his every
word spoken or written danger breeds
caution and only a wary man lives long
in that wild country where the hot ven-
dhyan plains meet the crags of the himel-
ians an hours ride westward or north-
ward and one crossed the border and was
among the hills where men lived by the
law of the knife

  the governor was alone in his cham-


weird tales

ber seated at his omately-carven table of
inlaid ebony through the wide window
open for the coolness he could see a
square of the blue himelian night dotted
with great white stars an adjacent para-
pet was a shadowy line and further cre-
nelles and embrasures were barely hinted
at in the dim starlight the governors
fortress was strong and situated outside
the walls of the city it guarded the
breeze that stirred the tapestries on the
wall brought faint noises from the streets
of peshkhauri-occasional snatches of
wailing song or the thrum of a cithern

  the governor read what he had writ-
ten slowly with his open hand shading
his eyes from the bronze butter-lamp
his lips moving absently as he read
he heard the drum of horses hoofs out-
side the barbican the sharp staccato of
the guards challenge he did not heed
intent upon his letter it was addressed
to the wazarn of vendhya at the royal
court of ayodhya and it stated after the
customary salutations

   let it be known to your excellency that i have
faithfully carried out your excellencys instruc-
tions the seven tribesmen are well guarded in
their prison and i have repeatedly sent word into
the hills that their chief come in person to bar-
gain for their release but he has made no move
except to send word that unless they are freed he
will burn peshkhauri and cover his saddle with
my hide begging your excellencys indulgence
this he is quite capable of attempting and i have
tripled the numbers of the lance guards the man
is not a native of ghulistan i can not with cer-
tainty predict his next move but since it is the
wish of the devi---

  he was out of his ivory chair and on
his feet facing the arched door all in one
instant he snatched at the curved sword
lying in its ornate scabbard on the table
and then checked the movement

  it was a woman who had entered un-
announced a woman whose gossamer
robes did not conceal the rich garments
beneath any more than they concealed
the suppleness and beauty of her tall slen-
der figure a filmy veil fell below her

breasts supported by a flowing head-dress
bound about with a triple gold braid and
adorned with a golden crescent her dark
eyes regarded the astonished governor
over the veil and then with an imperious
gesture of her white hand she uncovered
her face

  devi the governor dropped to his
knee before her his surprize and confu-
sion somewhat spoiling the stateliness of
his obeisance with a gesture she mo-
tioned him to rise and he hastened to
lead her to the ivory chair all the while
bowing level with his girdle but his
first words were of reproof

  your majesty this was most un-
wise the border is unsettled raids
from the hills are incessant you came
with a large attendance

  an ample retinue followed me to
peshkhauri she answered i lodged
my people there and came on to the fort
with my maid gitara

  chunder shan groaned in horror
devi you do not understand the
peril an hours ride from this spot the
hills swarm with barbarians who make a
profession of murder and rapine women
have been stolen and men stabbed be-
tween the fort and the city peshkhauri
is not like your southern provinces--
but i am here and unharmed she
interrupted with a trace of impatience
i showed my signet ring to the guard at
the gate and to the one outside your
door and they admitted me unannounced
not knowing me but supposing me to be
a secret courier from ayodhya let us
not now waste time

  you have received no word from the
chief of the barbarians

  none save threats and curses devi
he is wary and suspicious he deems it
a trap and perhaps he is not to be blamed
the kshatriyas have not always kept
their promises to the hill people
the people of the black circle



  he must be brought to terms broke
in yasmina the knuckles of her clenched
hands showing white

  i do not understand the governor
shook his head when i chanced to
capture these seven hillmen i reported
their capture to the wazam as is the cus-
tom and then before i could hang them
there came an order to hold them and
communicate with their chief this i did
but the man holds aloof as i have said
these men are of the tribe of afghulis
but he is a foreigner from the west and
he is called conan i have threatened to
hang them tomorrow at dawn if he does
not come

  good exclaimed the devi you
have done well and i will tell you why
i have given these orders my broth-
er- she faltered choking and the

governor bowed his head with the cus-
tomary gesture of respect for a departed
sovereign

  the king of vendhya was destroyed
by magic she said at last i have de-
voted my life to the destruction of his
murderers as he died he gave me a
clue and i have followed it i have read
the book of skalos and talked with name-
less hermits in the caves below jhelai
i learned how and by whom he was
destroyed his enemies were the black
seers of mount yimsha

  asura whispered chunder shan
paling

  her eyes knifed him through do
you fear them

  who does not your majesty he re-
plied they are black devils haunting
the uninhabited hills beyond the zhaibar
but the sages say that they seldom inter-
fere in the lives of mortal men

  why they slew my brother i do not
know she answered but i have sworn
on the altar of asura to destroy them
and i need the aid of a man beyond the

border a kshatriya army unaided would
never reach yimsha

  aye muttered chunder shan you
speak the truth there it would be fight
every step of the way with hairy hillmen
hurling down boulders from every height
and rushing us with their long knives in
every valley the turanians fought their
way through the himelians once but how
many returned to khurusun few of
those who escaped the swords of the
kshatriyas after the king your brother
defeated their host on the jhumda river
ever saw secunderam again

  and so i must control men across the
border she said men who know the
way to mount yimsha-

ut the tribes fear the black seers
and shun the unholy mountain
broke in the governor

  does the chief conan fear them
she asked

  well as to that muttered the gov-
ernor i doubt if there is anything that
devil fears

  so i have been told therefore he is
the man i must deal with he wishes
the release of his seven men very well
their ransom shall be the heads of the
black seers her voice thrummed with
hate as she uttered the last words and
her hands clenched at her sides she
looked an image of incarnate passion as
she stood there with her head thrown
high and her bosom heaving

  again the governor knelt for part of
his wisdom was the knowledge that a
woman in such an emotional tempest is
as perilous as a blind cobra to any about
her

   it shall be as you wish your majesty
then as she presented a calmer aspect
he rose and ventured to drop a word of
warning i can not predict what the
chief conans action will be the tribes-


weird tales

men are always turbulent and i have rea-
son to believe that emissaries from the
turanians are stirring them up to raid
our borders as your majesty knows the
turanians have established themselves
in secunderam and other northern cities
though the hill tribes remain uncon-
quered king yezdigerd has long looked
southward with greedy lust and perhaps
is seeking to gain by treachery what he
could not win by force of arms i have
thought that conan might well be one of
his spies

  we shall see she answered if he
loves his followers he will be at the gates
at dawn to parley i shall spend the
night in the fortress i came in disguise
to peshkhauri and lodged my retinue at
an inn instead of the palace besides my
people only yourself knows of my pres-
ence here

  i shall escort you to your quarters
your majesty said the governor and as
they emerged from the doorway he beck-
oned the warrior on guard there and the
man fell in behind them spear held at
salute

  the maid waited veiled like her mis-
tress outside the door and the group
traversed a wide winding corridor light-
ed by smoky torches and reached the
quarters reserved for visiting notables-
generals and viceroys mostly none of the
royal family had ever honored the fort-
ress before chunder shan had a per-
turbed feeling that the suite was not suit-
able to such an exalted personage as the
devi and though she sought to make
him feel at ease in her presence he was
glad when she dismissed him and he
bowed himself out all the menials of
the fort had been summoned to serve his
royal guest-though he did not divulge
her identity-and he stationed a squad of
spearmen- before her doors among them
the warrior who had guarded his own

chamber in his preoccupation he forgot
to replace the man

  the governor had not been gone long
from her when yasmina suddenly re-
membered something else which she had
wished to discuss with him but had for-
gotten until that moment it concerned
the past actions of one kerim shah a
nobleman from iranistan who had dwelt
for a while in peshkhauri before coming
on to the court at ayodhya a vague
suspicion concerning the man had been
stirred by a glimpse of him in peshkhauri
that night she wondered if he had fol-
lowed her from ayodhya being a truly
remarkable devi she did not summon
the governor to her again but hurried out
into the corridor alone and hastened
toward his chamber

chunder shan entering his cham-
ber closed the door and went to
his table there he took the letter he had
been writing and tore it to bits scarce-
ly had he finished when he heard some-
thing drop softly onto the parapet adja-
cent to the window he looked up to see
a figure loom briefly against the stars and
then a man dropped lightly into the
room the light glinted on a long sheen
of steel in his hand

  shhhh he warned dont make
a noise or ill send the devil a henchman

  the governor checked his motion
toward the sword on the table he was
within reach of the yard-long zhaibar
knife that glittered in the intruders fist
and he knew the desperate quickness of
a hillman

  the invader was a tall man at once
strong and supple he was dressed like a
hillman but his dark features and blazing
blue eyes did not match his garb chunder
shan had never seen a man like him he
was not an easterner but some barbarian
from the west but his aspect was as
the people of the black circle



untamed and formidable as any of the
hairy tribesmen who haunt the hills of
ghulistan

  you come like a thief in the night
commented the governor recovering some
of his composure although he remem-
bered that there was no guard within call
still the hillman could not know that

  i climbed a bastion snarled the in-
truder a guard thrust his head over
the battlement in time for me to rap it
with my knife-hilt

  you are conan

  who else you sent word into the
hills that you wished for me to come and
parley with you well by crom ive
come keep away from that table or ill
gut you

  i merely wish to seat myself an-
swered the governor carefully sinking
into the ivory chair which he wheeled
away from the table conan moved rest-
lessly before him glancing suspiciously
at the door thumbing the razor edge of
his three-foot knife he did not walk
like an afghuli and was bluntly direct
where the east is subtle

  you have seven of my men he said
abruptly you refused the ransom i of-
fered what the devil do you want

  let us discuss terms answered chun-
der shan cautiously

  terms there was a timbre of dan-
gerous anger in his voice what do you
mean havent i offered you gold

  chunder shan laughed

  gold there is more gold in pesh-
khauri than you ever saw

  youre a liar retorted conan ive
seen the suk of the goldsmiths in khuru-
sun

  well more than any afghuli ever
saw amended chunder shan and it
is but a drop of all the treasure of ven-
dhya why should we desire gold it

would be more to our advantage to hang
these seven thieves

  conan ripped out a sulfurous oath and
the long blade quivered in his grip as
the muscles rose in ridges on his brown
arm

ill split your head like a ripe melon
a wild blue flame flickered in the hill-
mans eyes but chunder shan shrugged
his shoulders though keeping an eye on
the keen steel

  you can kill me easily and probably
escape over the wall afterward but that
would not save the seven tribesmen my
men would surely hang them and these
men are headmen among the afghulis
i know it snarled conan the
tribe is baying like wolves at my heels be-
cause i have not procured their release
tell me in plain words what you want
because by crom if theres no other
way ill raise a horde and lead it to
the very gates of peshkhauri

  looking at the man as he stood square-
ly knife in fist and eyes glaring chunder
shan did not doubt that he was capable
of it the governor did not believe any
hill-horde could take peshkhauri but he
did not wish a devastated countryside

  there is a mission you must per-
form he said choosing his words with
as much care as if they had been razors

there-

  conan had sprung back wheeling to
face the door at the same instant lips
asnarl his barbarian ears had caught
the quick tread of soft slippers outside
the door the next instant the door was
thrown open and a slim silk-robed form
entered hastily pulling the door shut-
then stopping short at sight of the hill-
man

  chunder shan sprang up his heart
jumping into his mouth

  devi he cried involuntarily losing
his head momentarily in his fright


weird tales

  devi it was like an explosive echo
from the hillmans lips chunder shan
saw recognition and intent flame up in
the fierce blue eyes

  the governor shouted desperately and
caught at his sword but the hillman
moved with the devastating speed of a
hurricane he sprang knocked the gov-
ernor sprawling with a savage blow of his
knife-hilt swept up the astounded devi
in one brawny arm and leaped for the
window chunder shan struggling fran-
tically to his feet saw the man poise an
instant on the sill in a flutter of silken
skirts and white limbs that was his royal
captive and heard his fierce exultant
snarl now dare to hang my men
and then conan leaped to the parapet and
was gone a wild scream floated back
to the governors ears

  guard guard screamed the gov-
ernor struggling up and running drunk-
enly to the door he tore it open and
reeled into the hall his shouts re-echoed
along the corridors and warriors came
running gaping to see the governor hold-
ing his broken head from which the
blood streamed

  turn out the lancers he roared
there has been an abduction even
in his frenzy he had enough sense left to
withhold the full truth he stopped short
as he heard a sudden drum of hoofs out-
side a frantic scream and a wild yell of
barbaric exultation

  followed by the bewildered guards-
men the governor raced for the stair in
the courtyard of the fort a force of lanc-
ers always stood by saddled steeds ready
to ride at an instants notice chunder
shan led his squadron flying after the
fugitive though his head swam so he had
to hold with both hands to the saddle
he did not divulge the identity of the
victim but said merely that the noble-
woman who had borne the royal signet-

ring had been carried away by the chief
of the afghulis the abductor was out of
sight and hearing but they knew the path
he would strike-the road that runs
straight to the mouth of the zhaibar
there was no moon peasant huts rose
dimly in the starlight behind them fell
away the grim bastion of the fort and
the towers of peshkhauri ahead of them
loomed the black walls of the himelians

	khemsa uses magic

in the confusion that reigned in the
fortress while the guard was being
turned out no one noticed that the girl
who had accompanied the devi slipped
out the great arched gate and vanished
in the darkness she ran straight for the
city her garments tucked high she did
not follow the open road but cut straight
through fields and over slopes avoiding
fences and leaping irrigation ditches as
surely as if it were broad daylight and as
easily as if she were a trained masculine
runner the hoof-drum of the guards-
men had faded away up the hill road
before she reached the city wall she did
not go to the great gate beneath whose
arch men leaned on speaxs and craned
their necks into the darkness discussing
the unwonted activity about the fortress
she skirted the wall until she reached a
certain point where the spire of a tower
was visible above the battlements then
she placed her hands to her mouth and
voiced a low weird call that carried
strangely

  almost instantly a head appeared at an
embrasure and a rope came wriggling
down the wall she seized it placed a
foot in the loop at the end and waved
her arm then quickly and smoothly she
was drawn up the sheer stone curtain
an instant later she scrambled over the
merlons and stood up on a flat roof which
covered a house that was built against
the people of the black circle



the wall there was an open trap there
and a man in a camel-hair robe who si-
lently coiled the rope not showing in
any way the strain of hauling a full-
grown woman up a forty-foot wall

  where is kerim shah she gasped
panting after her long run

  asleep in the house below you have
news

  conan has stolen the devi out of the
fortress and carried her away into the
hills she blurted out her news in a
rush the words stumbling over one an-
other

  khemsa showed no emotion but mere-
ly nodded his turbaned head kerim
shah will be glad to hear that he said

  wait the girl threw her supple
arms about his neck she was panting
hard but not only from exertion her
eyes blazed like black jewels in the star-
light her upturned face was close to
khemsas but though he submitted to
her embrace he did not return it

  do not tell the hyrkanian she
panted let us use this knowledge our-
selves the governor has gone into the
hills with his riders but he might as well
chase a ghost he has not told anyone
that it was the devi who was kidnapped
none in peshkhauri or the fort knows it
except us

  but what good does it do us the
man expostulated my masters sent me
with kerim shah to aid him in every
way--

  aid yourself she cried fiercely
shake off your yoke

  you mean-disobey my masters
he gasped and she felt his whole body
turn cold under her arms

  aye she shook him in the fury of
her emotion you too are a magician
why will you be a slave using your
powers only to elevate others use your
arts for yourself

  that is forbidden he was shaking
as if with an ague i am not one of the
black circle only by the command of
the masters do i dare to use the knowl-
edge they have taught me

  but you can use it she argued pas-
sionately do as i beg you of course
conan has taken the devi to hold as hos-
tage against the seven tribesmen in the
governors prison destroy them so
chunder shan can not use them to buy
back the devi then let us go into the
mountains and take her from the afghu-
lis they can not stand against your sor-
cery with their knives the treasure of
the vendhyan kings will be ours as ran-
som-and then when we have it in our
hands we can trick them and sell her to
the king of turan we shall have wealth
beyond our maddest dreams with it we
can buy warriors we will take khorbhul
oust the turanians from the hills and
send our hosts southward become king
and queen of an empire

  khemsa too was panting shaking like
a leaf in her grasp his face showed gray
in the starlight beaded with great drops
of perspiration

  i love you she cried fiercely writh-
ing her body against his almost stran-
gling him in her wild embrace shaking
him in her abandon i will make a king
of you for love of you i betrayed my
mistress for love of me betray your mas-
ters why fear the black seers by your
love for me you have broken one of their
laws already break the rest you are
as strong as they

  a man of ice could not have withstood
the searing heat of her passion and fury
with an inarticulate cry he crushed her
to him bending her backward and show-
ering gasping kisses on her eyes face and
lips

  ill do it his voice was thick with
laboring emotions he staggered like a


weird tales

drunken man the arts they have taught
me shall work for me not for my mas-
ters we shall be rulers of the world-

of the world-

  come then twisting lithely out of
his embrace she seized his hand and led
him toward the trap-door first we must
make sure that the governor does not ex-
change those seven afghulis for the
devi

he moved like a man in a daze until
they had descended a ladder and
she paused in the chamber below kerim
shah lay on a couch motionless an arm
across his face as though to shield his
sleeping eyes from the soft light of a
brass lamp she plucked khemsas arm
and made a quick gesture across her own
throat khemsa lifted his hand then his
expression changed and he drew away

  i have eaten his salt he muttered
besides he can not interfere with us
he led the girl through a door that
opened on a winding stair after their
soft tread had faded into silence the man
on the couch sat up kerim shah wiped
the sweat from his face a knife-thrust
he did not dread but he feared khemsa
as a man fears a poisonous reptile

  people who plot on roofs should re-
member to lower their voices he mut-
tered but as khemsa has turned against
his masters and as he was my only con-
tact between them i can count on their
aid no longer from now on i play the
game in my own way

  rising to his feet he went quickly to
a table drew pen and parchment from his
girdle and scribbled a few succinct lines

  to khosru khan governor of secunderam
the cimmerian conan has carried the devi yas-
mina to the villages of the afghulis it is an op-
portunity to get the devi into our hands as the
king has so long desired send three thousand
horsemen at once i will meet them in the valley
p gurashah with native guides

  and he signed it with a name that was
not in the least like kerim shah

  then from a golden cage he drew forth
a carrier pigeon to whose leg he made fast
the parchment rolled into a tiny cylinder
and secured with gold wire then he
went quickly to a casement and tossed
the bird into the night it wavered on
fluttering wings balanced and was gone
like a flitting shadow catching up hel-
met sword and cloak kerim shah hur-
ried out of the chamber and down the
winding stair

the prison quarters of peshkhauri
were separated from the rest of the
city by a massive wall in which was set
a single iron-bound door under an arch
over the arch burned a lurid red cresset
and beside the door squatted a warrior
with spear and shield

  this warrior leaning on his spear and
yawning from time to time started sud-
denly to his feet he had not thought he
had dozed but a man was standing be-
fore him a man he had not heard ap-
proach the man wore a camel-hair robe
and a green turban in the flickering
light of the cresset his features were
shadowy but a pair of lambent eyes
shone surprizingly in the lurid glow

  who comes demanded the warrior
presenting his spear who are you

  the stranger did not seem perturbed
though the spear-point touched his bos-
om his eyes held the warriors with
strange intensity

  what are you obliged to do he
asked strangely

  to guard the gate the warrior
spoke thickly and mechanically he stood
rigid as a statue his eyes slowly glazing

  you lie you are obliged to obey me
you have looked into my eyes and your
soul is no longer your own open that
door
the people of the black circle



  stiffly with the wooden features of an
image the guard wheeled about drew a
great key from his girdle turned it in
the massive lock and swung open the
door then he stood at attention his
unseeing stare straight ahead of him

  a woman glided from the shadows and
laid an eager hand on the mesmerists
arm

  bid him fetch us horses khemsa
she whispered

  no need of that answered the rakh-
sha lifting his voice slightly he spoke to
the guardsman i have no more use for
you kill yourself

  like a man in a trance the warrior
thrust the butt of his spear against the
base of the wall and placed the keen
head against his body just below the ribs
then slowly stolidly he leaned against
it with all his weight so that it trans-
fixed his body and came out between his
shoulders sliding down the shaft he lay
still the spear jutting above him its full
length like a horrible stalk growing out
of his back

  the girl stared down at him in mor-
bid fascination until khemsa took her
arm and led her through the gate torch-
es lighted a narrow space between the
outer wall and a lower inner one in
which were arched doors at regular in-
tervals a warrior paced this enclosure
and when the gate opened he came saun-
tering up so secure in his knowledge of
the prisons strength that he was not sus-
picious until khemsa and the girl emerged
from the archway then it was too late
the rahksha did not waste time in hyp-
notism though his action savored of
magic to the girl the guard lowered
his spear threateningly opening his
mouth to shout an alarm that would bring
spearmen swarming out of the guard-
rooms at either end of the alleyway
khemsa flicked the spear aside with his

left hand as a man might flick a straw
and his right flashed out and back seem-
ing gently to caress the warriors neck in
passing and the guard pitched on his
face without a sound his head lolling on
a broken neck

  khemsa did not glance at him but
went straight to one of the arched doors
and placed his open hand against the
heavy bronze lode with a rending shud-
der the portal buckled inward as the
girl followed him through she saw that
the thick teakwood hung in splinters the
bronze bolts were bent and twisted from
their sockets and the great hinges brok-
en and disjointed a thousand-pound
battering-ram with forty men to swing it
could have shattered the barrier no more
completely khemsa was drunk with free-
dom and the exercise of his power glory-
ing in his might and flinging his strength
about as a young giant exercises his thews
with unnecessary vigor in the exultant
pride of his prowess

  the broken door let them into a small
courtyard lit by a cresset opposite the
door was a wide grille of iron bars a
hairy hand was visible gripping one of
these bars and in the darkness behind
them glimmered the whites of eyes

  khemsa stood silent for a space gaz-
ing into the shadows from which those
glimmering eyes gave back his stare with
burning intensity then his hand went
into his robe and came out again and
from his opening fingers a shimmering
feather of sparkling dust sifted to the
flags instantly a flare of green fire light-
ed the enclosure in the brief glare the
forms of seven men standing motionless
behind the bars were limned in vivid
detail tall hairy men in ragged hillmens
garments they did not speak but in
their eyes blazed the fear of death and
their hairy fingers gripped the bars

  the fire died out but the glow re-


weird tales

mained a quivering ball of lambent green
that pulsed and shimmered on the flags
before khemsas feet the wide gaze of
the tribesmen was fixed upon it it wav-
ered elongated it turned into a luminous
green smoke spiraling upward it twist-
ed and writhed like a great shadowy ser-
pent then broadened and billowed out in
shining folds and whirls it grew to a
cloud moving silently over the flags--
straight toward the grille the men
watched its coming with dilated eyes the
bars quivered with the grip of their des-
perate fingers bearded lips parted but
no sound came forth the green cloud
rolled on the bars and blotted them from
sight like a fog it oozed through the
grille and hid the men within from the
enveloping folds came a strangled gasp
as of a man plunged suddenly under the
surface of water that was all

  khemsa touched the girls arm as she
stood with parted lips and dilated eyes
mechanically she turned away with him
looking back over her shoulder al-
ready the mist was thinning close to the
bars she saw a pair of sandaled feet the
toes turned upward-she glimpsed the
indistinct outlines of seven still pros-
trate shapes

  and now for a steed swifter than the
fastest horse ever bred in a mortal sta-
ble khemsa was saying we will be
in afghulistan before dawn

	an encounter in the pass

yasmina devi could never clearly re-
member the details of her abduction
the unexpectedness and violence stunned
her she had only a confused impression
of a whirl of happenings-the terrifying
grip of a mighty arm the blazing eyes
of her abductor and his hot breath burn-
ing on her flesh the leap through the
window to the parapet the mad race
across battlements and roofs when the

fear of falling froze her the reckless de-
scent of a rope bound to a merlon-he
went down almost at a run his captive
folded limply over his brawny shoulder
-all this was a befuddled tangle in the
devis mind she retained a more vivid
memory of him running fleetly into the
shadows of the trees carrying her like a
child and vaulting into the saddle of a
fierce bhalkhana stallion which reared
and snorted then there was a sensation
of flying and the racing hoofs were strik-
ing sparks of fire from the flinty road as
the stallion swept up the slopes

  as the girls mind cleared her first sen-
sations were furious rage and shame she
was appalled the rulers of the golden
kingdoms south of the himelians were
considered little short of divine and she
was the devi of vendhya fright was
submerged in regal wrath she cried out
furiously and began struggling she yas-
mina to be carried on the saddle-bow of a
hill chief like a common wench of the
market-place he merely hardened his
massive thews slightly against her writh-
ings and for the first time in her life she
experienced the coercion of superior phys-
ical strength his arms felt like iron
about her slender limbs he glanced
down at her and grinned hugely his
teeth glimmered whitely in the starlight
the reins lay loose on the stallions flow-
ing mane and every thew and fiber of the
great beast strained as he hurtled along
the boulder-strewn trail but conan sat
easily almost carelessly in the saddle
riding like a centaur

  you hill-bred dog she panted quiv-
ering with the impact of shame anger
and the realization of helplessness you
dare-you dare your life shall pay for
this where are you taking me

  to the villages of afghulistan he
answered casting a glance over his shoul-
der
the people of the black circle

j

  behind them beyond the slopes they
had traversed torches were tossing on the
walls of the fortress and he glimpsed a
flare of light that meant the great gate
had been opened and he laughed a
deep-throated boom gusty as the hill
wind

  the governor has sent his riders after
us he laughed by crom we will lead
him a merry chase what do you think
devi-will they pay seven lives for a
kshatriya princess

  they will send an army to hang you
and your spawn of devils she promised
him with conviction

  he laughed gustily and shifted her to
a more comfortable position in his arms
but she took this as a fresh outrage and
renewed her vain struggles until she saw
that her efforts were only amusing him
besides her light silken garments float-
ing on the wind were being outrageously
disarranged by her struggles she con-
cluded that a scornful submission was the
better part of dignity and lapsed into a
smoldering quiescence

  she felt even her anger being sub-
merged by awe as they entered the mouth
of the pass lowering like a black well
mouth in the blacker walls that rose like
colossal ramparts to bar their way it was
as if a gigantic knife had cut the zhaibar
out of walls of solid rock on either
hand sheer slopes pitched up for thou-
sands of feet and the mouth of the pass
was dark as hate even conan could not
see with any accuracy but he knew the
road even by night and knowing that
armed men were racing through the star-
light after him he did not check the
stallions speed the great brute was not
yet showing fatigue he thundered along
the road that followed the valley bed
labored up a slope swept along a low
ridge where treacherous shale on either
hand lurked for the unwary and came

upon a trail that followed the lap of the
left-hand wall

not even conan could spy in that
darkness an ambush set by zhaibar
tribesmen as they swept past the
black mouth of a gorge that opened into
the pass a javelin swished through
the air and thudded home behind the
stallions straining shoulder the great
beast let out his life in a shuddering sob
and stumbled going headlong in mid-
stride but conan had recognized the
flight and stroke of the javelin and he
acted with spring-steel quickness

  as the horse fell he leaped clear hold-
ing the girl aloft to guard her from
striking boulders he lit on his feet like
a cat thrust her into a cleft of rock and
wheeled toward the outer darkness draw-
ing his knife

  yasmina confused by the rapidity of
events not quite sure just what had hap-
pened saw a vague shape rush out of
the darkness bare feet slapping softly
on the rock ragged garments whipping
on the wind of his haste she glimpsed
the flicker of steel heard the lightning
crack of stroke parry and counter-stroke
and the crunch of bone as conans long
knife split the others skull

  conan sprang back crouching in the
shelter of the rocks out in the night
men were moving and a stentorian voice
roared what you dogs do you flinch
in curse you and take them

  conan started peered into the dark-
ness and lifted his voice

  yar afzal is it you

  there sounded a startled imprecation
and the voice called warily

  conan is it you conan

  aye the cimmerian laughed
come forth you old war-dog ive
slain one of your men

  there was movement among the rocks


weird tales

a light flared dimly and then a flame ap-
peared and came bobbing toward him
and as it approached a fierce bearded
countenance grew out of the darkness the
man who carried it held it high thrust
forward and craned his neck to peer
among the boulders it lighted the other
hand gripped a great curved tulwar co-
nan stepped forward sheathing his knife
and the other roared a greeting

  aye it is conan come out of your
rocks dogs it is conan

  others pressed into the wavering cir-
cle of light-wild ragged bearded men
with eyes like wolves and long blades in
their fists they did not see yasmina for
she was hidden by conans massive body
but peeping from her covert she knew
icy fear for the first time that night these
men were more like wolves than human
beings

  what are you hunting in the zhaibar
by night yar afzal conan demanded
of the burly chief who grinned like a
bearded ghoul

  who knows what might come up the
pass after dark we wazulis are night-
hawks but what of you conan

  i have a prisoner answered the cim-
merian and moving aside he disclosed
the cowering girl reaching a long arm
into the crevice he drew her trembling
forth

  her imperious bearing was gone she
stared timidly at the ring of bearded
faces that hemmed her in and was grate-
ful for the strong arm that clasped her
possessively the torch was thrust clofe
to her and there was a sucking intake of
breath about the ring

  she is my captive conan warned
glancing pointedly at the feet of the man
he had slain just visible within the ring
of light i was taking her to afghulis-
tan but now you have slain my horse and
the kshatriyas are close behind me

  come with us to my village sug-
gested yar afzal we have horses hid-
den in the gorge they can never follow
us in the darkness they are close be-
hind you you say

  so close that i hear now the clink of
their hoofs on the flint answered co-
nan grimly

  instantly there was movement the
torch was dashed out and the ragged
shapes melted like phantoms into the
darkness conan swept up the devi in
his arms and she did not resist the
rocky ground hurt her slim feet in their
soft slippers and she felt very small and
helpless in that brutish primordial black-
ness among those colossal nighted crags

  feeling her shiver in the wind that
moaned down the defiles conan jerked
a ragged cloak from its owners shoul-
ders and wrapped it about her he also
hissed a warning in her ear ordering her
to make no sound she did not hear the
distant clink of shod hoofs on rock that
warned the keen-eared hillmen but she
was far too frightened to disobey in any
event

  she could see nothing but a few faint
stars far above but she knew by the deep-
ening darkness when they entered the
gorge mouth there was a stir about them
the uneasy movement of horses a few
muttered words and conan mounted the
horse of the man he had killed lifting
the girl up in front of him like phan-
toms except for the click of their hoofs
the band swept away up the shadowy
gorge behind them on the trail they left
the dead horse and the dead man vhich
were found less than half an hour later
by the riders from the fortress who rec-
ognized the rnan as a wazuli and drew
their own conclusions accordingly

yasmina snuggled warmly in her cap-
tors arms grew drowsy in spite of
herself the motion of the horse though

it was uneven uphill and down yet pos-
sessed a certain rhythm which combined
with weariness and emotional exhaustion
to force sleep upon her she had lost all
sense of time or direction they moved
in soft thick darkness in which she some-
times glimpsed vaguely gigantic walls
sweeping up like black ramparts or great
crags shouldering the stars at times she
sensed echoing depths beneath them or
felt the wind of dizzy heights blowing
cold about her gradually these things
faded into a dreamy unwakefulness in
which the clink of hoofs and the creak
of saddles were like the irrelevant sounds
in a dream

  she was vaguely aware when the mo-
tion ceased and she was lifted down and
carried a few steps then she was laid
down on something soft and rustling
and something-a folded coat perhaps-
was thrust under her head and the cloak
in which she was wrapped was carefully
tucked about her she heard yar afzal
laugh

  a rare prize conan fit mate for a
chief of the afghulis

  not for me came conans answer-
ing rumble this wench will buy the
lives of my seven headmen blast their
souls

  that was the last she heard as she sank
into dreamless slumber

  she slept while armed men rode
through the dark hills and the fate of
kingdoms hung in the balance through
the shadowy gorges and defiles that night
there rang the hoofs of galloping horses
and the starlight glimmered on helmets
and curved blades until the ghoulish
shapes that haunt the crags stared into the
darkness from ravine and boulder and
wondered what things were afoot

  a band of these sat gaunt horses in
the black pit-mouth of a gorge as the
hurrying hoofs swept past their leader
w t-



a well-built man in a helmet and gilt-
braided cloak held up his hand warning-
ly until the riders had sped on then he
laughed softly

  they must have lost the trail or else
they have found that conan has already
reached the afghuli villages it will take
many riders to smoke out that hive there
will be squadrons riding up the zhaibar
by dawn

  if there is fighting in the hills there
will be looting muttered a voice behind
him in the dialect of the irakzai

  there will be looting answered the
man with the helmet but first it is our
business to reach the valley of gurashah
and await the riders that will be gallop-
ing southward from secunderam before
daylight

  he lifted his reins and rode out of the
defile his men falling in behind him-
thirty ragged phantoms in the starlight

	the black stallion

the sun was well up when yasmina
awoke she did not start and stare
blankly wondering where she was she
awoke with full knowledge of all that
had occurred her supple limbs were stiff
from her long ride and her firm flesh
still seemed to feel the contact of the
muscular arm that had borne her so far

  she was lying on a sheepskin covering
a pallet of leaves on a hard-beaten dirt
floor a folded sheepskin coat was under
her head and she was wrapped in a rag-
ged cloak she was in a large room the
walls of which were crudely but strong-
ly built of uncut rocks plastered with
sun-baked mud heavy beams supported
a roof of the same kind in which showed
a trap-door up to which led a ladder
there were no windows in the thick
walls only loop-holes there was one
door a sturdy bronze affair that must
have been looted from some vendhyan


weird tales

border tower opposite it was a wide
opening in the wall with no door but
several strong wooden bars in place be-
yond them yasmina saw a magnificent
black stallion munching a pile of dried
grass the building was fort dwelling-
place and stable in one

  at the other end of the room a girl in
the vest and baggy trousers of a hill-
woman squatted beside a small fire cook-
ing strips of meat on an iron grid laid
over blocks of stone there was a sooty
cleft in the wall a few feet from the
floor and some of the smoke found its
way out there the rest floated in blue
wisps about the room

  the hill-girl glanced at yasmina over
her shoulder displaying a bold hand-
some face and then continued her cook-
ing voices boomed outside then the
door was kicked open and conan strode
in he looked more enormous than ever
with the morning sunlight behind him
and yasmina noted some details that had
escaped her the night before his gar-
ments were clean and not ragged the
broad bakhariot girdle that supported
his knife in its ornamented scabbard
would have matched the robes of a prince
and there was a glint of fine turanian
mail under his shirt

  your captive is awake conan said
the wazuli girl and he grunted strode
up to the fire and swept the strips of
mutton off into a stone dish

  the squatting girl laughed up at him
with some spicy jest and he grinned
wolfishly and hooking a toe under her
haunches tumbled her sprawling onto
the floor she seemed to derive consid-
erable amusement from this bit of rough
horse-play but conan paid no more heed
to her producing a great hunk of bread
from somewhere with a copper jug of
wine he carried the lot to yasmina who

had risen from her pallet and was re-
garding him doubtfully

  rough fare for a devi girl but our
best he grunted it will fill your belly
at least

   he set the platter on the floor and she
was suddenly aware of a ravenous hunger
making no comment she seated herself
cross-legged on the floor and taking the
dish in her lap she began to eat using
her fingers which were all she had in
the way of table utensils after all adapt-
ability is one of the tests of true aristoc-
racy conan stood looking down at her
his thumbs hooked in his girdle he never
sat cross-legged after the eastern fashion

  where am i she asked abruptly

  in the hut of yar afzal the chief of
the khurum wazulis he answered
afghulistan lies a good many miles far-
ther on to the west well hide here
awhile the kshatriyas are beating up
the hills for you-several of their squads
have been cut up by the tribes already

  what are you going to do she
asked

  keep you until chundar shan is will-
ing to trade back my seven cow-thieves
he grunted women of the wazulis
are crushing ink out of shoki leaves and
after a while you can write a letter to the
governor

  a touch of her old imperious wrath
shook her as she thought how madden-
ingly her plans had gone awry leaving
her captive of the very man she had plot-
ted to get into her power she flung
down the dish with the remnants of her
meal and sprang to her feet tense with
anger

  i will not write a letter if you do
not take me back they will hang your
seven men and a thousand more besides

  the wazuli girl laughed mockingly
conan scowled and then the door opened
and yar afzal came swaggering in the
the people of the black circle



wazuli chief was as tall as conan and
of greater girth but he looked fat and
slow beside the hard compactness of the
cimmerian he plucked his red-stained
beard and stared meaningly at the wazu-
li girl and that wench rose and scurried
out without delay then yar afzal turned
to his guest

  the damnable people murmur co-
nan quoth he they wish me to mur-
der you and take the girl to hold for
ransom they say that anyone can tell
by her garments that she is a noble lady
they say why should the afghuli dogs
profit by her when it is the people who
take the risk of guarding her

  lend me your horse said conan
ill take her and go

  pish boomed yar afzal do you
think i cant handle my own people ill
have them dancing in their shirts if they
cross me they dont love you-or any
other outlander-but you saved my life
once and i will not forget come out
though conan a scout has returned

conan hitched at his girdle and fol-
lowed the chief outside they closed
the door after them and yasrnina peeped
through a loop-hole she looked out on
a level space before the hut at the far-
ther end of that space there was a cluster
of mud and stone huts and she saw naked
children playing among the boulders and
the slim erect women of the hills going
about their tasks

   directly before the chiefs hut a circle
of hairy ragged men squatted facing the
door conan and yar afzal stood a few
paces before the door and between them
and the ring of warriors another man sat
cross-legged this one was addressing
his chief in the harsh accents of the wazu-
li which yasmina could scarcely under-
stand though as part of her royal educa-
tion she had been taught the languages

of iranistan and the kindred tongues of
ghulistan

  i talked with a dagozai who saw the
riders last night said the scout he
was lurking near when they came to the
spot where we ambushed the lord conan
he overheard their speech chunder
shan was with them thev found the

                                             j

dead horse and one of the men recog-
nized it as conans then they found the
man conan slew and knew him for a
wazuli it seemed to them that conan
had been slain and the girl taken by the
wazuli so they turned aside from their
purpose of following to afghulistan but
they did not know from which village
the dead man was come and we had left
no trail a kshatriya could follow

  so they rode to the nearest wazuli
village which was the village of jugra
and burnt it and slew many of the peo-
ple but the men of kliojur came upon
them in darkness and slew some of them
and wounded the governor so the sur-
vivors retired down the zhaibar in the
darkness before dawn but they returned
with reinforcements before sunrise and
there has been skirmishing and fighting
in the hills all morning it is said that a
great army is being raised to sweep the
hills about the zhaibar the tribes are
whetting their knives and laying ambush-
es in every pass from here to gurashah
valley moreover kerim shah has re-
turned to the hills

  a grunt went around the circle and
yasmina leaned closer to the loop-hole
at the name she had begun to mistrust

  where went he demanded yar af-
zal

  the dagozai did not know with him
were thirty irakzai of the lower villages
they rode into the hills and diappeared

  these irakzai are jackals that follow
a lion for crumbs growled yar afzal
they have been lapping up the coins


weird tales

kerim shah scatters among the border
tribes to buy men like horses i like him
not for all he is our kinsman from iran-
istan

  hes not even that said conan i
know him of old hes an hyrkanian
a spy of yezdigerds if i catch him ill
hang his hide to a tamarisk

  but the kshatriyas clamored the
men in the semicircle are we to squat
on our haunches until they smoke us out
they will learn at last in which wazuli
village the wench is held we are not
loved by the zhaibari they will help the
kshatriyas hunt us out

  let them come grunted yar afzal
we can hold the defiles against a host
one of the men leaped up and shook
his fist at conan

  are we to take all the risks while he
reaps the rewards he howled are
we to fight his battles for him

  with a stride conan reached him and
bent slightly to stare full into his
hairy face the cimmerian had not drawn
his long knife but his left hand grasped
the scabbard jutting the hilt suggestive-
ly forward

  i ask no man to fight my battles he
said softly draw your blade if you
dare you yapping dog

  the wazuli started back snarling like
a cat

  dare to touch me and here are fifty
men to rend you apart he screeched

  what roared yar afzal his face
purpling with wrath his whiskers bris-
tled his belly swelled with his rage are
you chief of khurum do the wazulis
take orders from yar afzal or from a
low-bred cur

  the man cringed before his invincible
chief and yar afzal striding up to him
seized him by the throat and choked him
until his face was turning black then he
hurled the man savagely against the

ground and stood over him with his tui-
war in his hand

  is there any who questions my author-
ity he roared and his warriors looked
down sullenly as his bellicose glare swept
their semicircle yar afzal grunted scorn-
fully and sheathed his weapon with a
gesture that was the apex of insult then
he kicked the fallen agitator with a con-
centrated vindictiveness that brought
howls from his victim

  get down the valley to the watchers
on the heights and bring word if they
have seen anything commanded yar
afzal and the man went shaking with
fear and grinding his teeth with fury

  yar afzal then seated himself ponder-
ously on a stone growling in his beard
conan stood near him legs braced apart
thumbs hooked in his girdle narrowly
watching the assembled warriors they
stared at him sullenly not daring to
brave yar afzals fury but hating the
foreigner as only a hillman can hate

  now listen to me you sons of name-
less dogs while i tell you what the lord
conan and i have planned to fool the
kshatriyas-the boom of yar afzals
bull-like voice followed the discomfited
warrior as he slunk away from the as-
sembly

  the man passed by the cluster of huts
where women who had seen his defeat
laughed at him and called stinging com-
ments and hastened on along the trail
that wound among spurs and rocks toward
the valley head

  just as he rounded the first turn that
took him out of sight of the village he
stopped short gaping stupidly he had
not believed it possible for a stranger to
enter the valley of khurum without being
detected by the hawk-eyed watchers along
the heights yet a man sat cross-legged
on a low ledge beside the path-a maa
in a camel-hair robe and a green turban
the people of the black circle



  the wazulis mouth gaped for a yell
and his hand leaped to his knife-hilt
but at that instant his eyes met those of
the stranger and the cry died in his throat
his fingers went limp he stood like a
statue his own eyes glazed and vacant

for minutes the scene held motionless
then the man on the ledge drew a
cryptic symbol in the dust on the rock
with his forefinger the wazuli did not
see him place anything within the com-
pass of that emblem but presently some-
thing gleamed there-a round shiny
black ball that looked like polished jade
the man in the green turban took this up
and tossed it to the wazuli who me-
chanically caught it

   carry this to yar afzal he said and
the wazuli turned like an automaton and
went back along the path holding the
black jade ball in his outstretched hand
he did not even turn his head to the re-
newed jeers of the women as he passed
the huts he did not seem to hear

  the man on the ledge gazed after him
with a cryptic smile a girls head rose
above the rim of the ledge and she looked
at him with admiration and a touch of
fear that had not been present the night
before

  why did you do that she asked

  he ran his fingers through her dark
locks caressingly

  are you still dizzy from your flight
on the horse-of-air that you doubt my
wisdom he laughed as long as yar
afzal lives conan will bide safe among
the wazuli fighting-men their knives
are sharp and there are many of them
what i plot will be safer even for me
than to seek to slay him and take her
from among them it takes no wizard to
predict what the wazulis will do and
what conan will do when my victim

hands the globe of yezud to the chief of
khurum

  back before the hut yar afzal halted
in the midst of some tirade surprized
and displeased to see the man he had sent
up the valley pushing his way through
the throng

  i bade you go to the watchers the
chief bellowed you have not had time
to come from them

   the other did not reply he stood wood-
enly staring vacantly into the chiefs face
his palm outstretched holding the jade
ball conan looking over yar afzals
shoulder murmured something and
reached to touch the chiefs arm but as
he did so yar afzal in a paroxysm of
anger struck the man with his clenched
fist and felled him like an ox as he
fell the jade sphere rolled to yar afzals
foot and the chief seeming to see it for
the first time bent and picked it up
the men staring perplexedly at hieir
senseless comrade saw their chief bend
but they did not see what he picked up
from the ground

  yar afzal straightened glanced at the
jade and made a motion to thrust it into
his girdle

  carry that fool to his hut he
growled he has the look of a lotus-
eater he returned me a blank stare i-
ate

  in his right hand moving toward his
girdle he had suddenly felt movement
where movement should not be his
voice died away as he stood and glared
at nothing and inside his clenched right
hand he felt the quivering of change of
motion of life he no longer held a
smooth shining sphere in his fingers and
he dared not look his tongue clove to
the roof of his mouth and he could not
open his hand his astonished warriors
saw yar afzafs eyes distend the color ebb
from his face then suddenly a bellow


weird tales

of agony burst from his bearded lips he
swayed and fell as if struck by lightning
his right arm tossed out in front of him
face down he lay and from between his
opening fingers crawled a spider-a hid-
eous black hairy-legged monster whose
body shone like black jade the men
yelled and gave back suddenly and the
creature scuttled into a crevice of the rocks
and disappeared

  the warriors started up glaring wild-
ly and a voice rose above their clamor a
far-carrying voice of command which
came from none knew where after-
ward each man there-who still lived-
denied that he had shouted but all there
heard it

  yar afzal is dead kill the out-
lander

  that shout focused their whirling
minds as one doubt bewilderment and
fear vanished in the uproaring surge of
the blood-lust a furious yell rent the
skies as the tribesmen responded instant-
ly to the suggestion they came headlong
across the open space cloaks flapping
eyes blazing knives lifted

gonans action was as quick as theirs
as the voice shouted he sprang for
the hut door but they were closer to
him than he was to the door and with
one foot on the sill he had to wheel and
parry the swipe of a yard-long blade he
split the mans skull-ducked another
swinging knife and gutted the wielder-
felled a man with his left fist and stabbed
another in the belly-and heaved back
mightily against the closed door with his
shoulders hacking blades were nicking
chips out of the jambs about his ears
but the door flew open under the impact
of his shoulders and he went stumbling
backward into the room a bearded tribes-
man thrusting with all his fury as conan
sprang back over-reached and pitched

head-first through the doorway conan
stooped grasped the slack of his gar-
ments and hauled him clear and slammed
the door in the faces of the men who
came surging into it bones saapped un-
der the impact and the next instant co-
nan slammed the bolts into place and
whirled with desperate haste to meet the
man who sprang from the floor and tore
into action like a madman

  yasmina cowered in a corner staring
in horror as the two men fought back and
forth across the room almost trampling
her at times the flash and clangor of
their blades filled the room and outside
the mob clamored like a wolf-pack hack-
ing deafeningly at the bronze door with
their long knives and dashing huge rocks
against it somebody fetched a tree trunk
and the door began to stagger under the
thunderous assault yasmina clasped her
ears staring wildly violence and fury
within cataclysmic madness without the
stallion in his stall neighed and reared
thundering with his heels against the
walls he wheeled and launched his hoofs
through the bars just as the tribesman
backing away from conans murderous
swipes stumbled against them his spine
cracked in three places like a rotten branch
and he was hurled headlong against the
cimmerian bearing him backward so
that they both crashed to the beaten floor

  yasmina cried out and ran forward
to her dazed sight it seemed that both
were slain she reached them just as
conan threw aside the corpse and rose
she caught his arm trembling from head
to foot

  oh you live i thought-i thought
you were dead

  he glanced down at her quickly into
the pale upturned face and the wide
staring dark eyes

  why are you trembling he demand-
the people of the black circle



ed why should you care if i live or
die

  a vestige of her poise returned to her
and she drew away making a rather piti-
ful attempt at playing the devi

  you are preferable to those wolves
howling without she answered gestur-
ing toward the door the stone sill of
which was beginning to splinter away

  that wont hold long he muttered
then turned and went swiftly to the stall
of the stallion

  yasmina clenched her hands and caught
her breath as she saw him tear aside the
splintered bars and go into the stall with
the maddened beast the stallion reared
above him neighing terribly hoofs lifted
eyes and teeth flashing and ears laid back
but conan leaped and caught his mane
with a display of sheer strength that
seemed impossible and dragged the beast
down on his forelegs the steed snorted
and quivered but stood still while the
man bridled him and clapped on the
gold-worked saddle with the wide silver
stirrups

  wheeling the beast around in the stall
conan called quickly to yasmina and
the girl came sidling nervously past the
stallions heels conan was working at
the stone wall talking swiftly as he
worked

  a secret door in the wall here that
not even the wazuli know about yar
afzal showed it to me once when he was

drunk it opens out into the mouth of
the ravine behind the hut ha

  as he tugged at a projection that
seemed casual a whole section of the
wall slid back on oiled iron runners
looking through the girl saw a narrow
defile opening in a sheer stone cliff within
a few feet of the huts back wall then
conan sprang into the saddle and hauled
her up before him behind them the
great door groaned like a living thing
and crashed in and a yell rang to the
roof as the entrance was instantly flooded
with hairy faces and knives in hairy fists
and then the great stallion went through
the wall like a javelin from a catapult
and thundered into the defile running
low foam flying from the bit-rings

  that move came as an absolute sur-
prize to the wazulis it was a surprize
too to those stealing down the ravine
it happened so quickly-the hurricane-
like charge of the great horse-that a man
in a green turban was unable to get out
of the way he went down under the
frantic hoofs and a girl screamed co-
nan got one glimpse of her as they thun-
dered by-a slim dark girl in silk trous-
ers and a jeweled breast-band flattening
herself against the ravine wall then the
black horse and his riders were gone up
the gorge like the spume blown before a
storm and the men who came tumbling
through the wail into the defile after
them met that which changed their yells
of blood-lust to shrill screams of fear and
death

  jest of warburg tantavul

by seabury quinn

youve kept me out thus far but some
day ill get in and-

f m -

                                                                   fh

a tale about an evil old man who reached back from the grave to work his
will-a story of jules de grandin

warburg tantavul was dy-
ing little more than skin and
bones his face like a mask of
parchment drawn drum-tight across his
skull crisscrossed with myriad wrinkles so
small and fine and near together that they
made shadows instead of lines he lay
propped up with pillows in the big sleigh
bed and smiled as though he found the
thought of dissolution faintly humorous

  even in comparatively good health the
    

man was never prepossessing now
wasted with disease that smile of self-
sufficient satisfaction mingled with ma-
lignant glee upon his face he was noth-
ing less than hideous the eyes which
nature gave him were small deep-set
and an oddly terrifying shade of yellow
calculating cruel and ruthless as the yel-
low orbs of a crafty and ill-natured cat
the mouth which his own thoughts had
fashioned through the years was wide
the jest of warburg tantavul



and thin-lipped almost colorless and
even in repose was always tightly drawn
against his small and queerly perfect
teeth now as he smiled a flickering
light lambent as the quick reflection of
an unseen flame flared in his yellow eyes
and a hard white line of teeth showed on
his lower lip as though he bit it to hold
back a chuckle

   and youre still determined that youll
marry arabella he asked his son fixing
his sardonic mocking smile upon the
young mans face

  yes father but-

  no buts my boy-this time his
chuckle came low and muted but at the
same time sharp and glassy-hard-no
buts ive told you im against the match
and that youll rue it to your dying day if
you should marry her but-he paused
and the breath rasped in his wizened throat
-go ahead and marry her if you will
ive said my say and warned you-heh
heh my boy never say your father didnt
warn you

   he lay back on his piled-up pillows for
a moment swallowing convulsively as
though to force the fleeting life-breath
back then abruptly get out he or-
dered get out and stay out you poor
fool but remember what ive said

  father young tantavul began tak-
ing a quick step toward the head of the
bed but the look of concentrated fury
mixed with hatred which flashed up in
the old mans tawny eyes halted him in
midstride

  get - out - i - said his father
snarled then as the door closed softly on
his son

  nurse-hand-me-that-picture
his breath was coming slowly now in
shallow labored gasps but the claw-like
fingers of his withered hand writhed in a
gesture of command pointing to the sil-
ver-framed photograph of a woman

 one day back in  seabury
quinn wrote a story called the hor-
ror on the links which was published
in weird tales for october of that
year the story told f a weird and
uncanny mystery that was solved by a
mercurial egotistical yet altogether
human and likable french scientist
named jules de grandin this strange
figure--occultist phantom-lighter and
ghost-breaker detective and physi-
cian vain yet lovable-at nee cap-
tured the sympathies of our readers
and also fired the imagination i kr
quinn whose literary creation the
little frenchman is since the horror
on the links appeared this megazine
has printed more than fifty stories
about the weird exploits of the indomi-
table little frenchman and hopes t
print as many mere in the future
month after month year after year
jules de grandin has grown in the af-
fesfions of the reading public and his
appearance in a mew try is wel-
comed by many fhoisesmds of de ran-
din faris as occasion for refolcing
if you have not yet made the acquaint-
ance of this strangest and most as-
tonishing detective of fiction you
now have the opportunity to meet him
in this stery the jest of warburg
tantavul

which stood upon a little table in the bed-
room window-bay

  he clutched the portrait which she
handed him as though it were some pre-
cious relic and for a minute let his yel-
low eyes rove over it lucy he whis-
pered hoarsely and now his words were
thick and indistinct lucy theyll be mar-
ried spite of all that i have said-theyll
be married lucy--dye hear thin and 
high-pitched as a childs his voice rose to

a shrill and piping treble as he grasped
the pictures heavy silver frame and held it
level with his face theyll be married
lucy my dear and theyll have-

  abruptly as a penny whistles note is
stilled when no more air is blown in it
old tantavuls cry was hushed the pic-
ture still grasped in his hands fell to the
tufted coverlet with a soft and muffled
thud the mans lean jaw relaxed and he
slumped back on his pile of pillows with
a shadow of the mocking smile still show-
ing in his glazing eyes

  etiquette requires that the nurse await
the doctors confirmation at such times
so obedient to professional dictates miss
williamson stood beside the bed until i
felt the dead mans pulse and nodded
then with the skill of years of practise
she began her offices bandaging the
wrists and jaw and ankles that the body
might be ready when the representative
of martins funeral home came to con-
vey it to the operating-room



my friend de grandin was annoyed
arms akimbo knuckles on hips
forcing back his black-silk kimono till it
resembled the outspread wings of an
angry bat he took his stance in the center
of the study and voiced his plaint in no
uncertain terms in fifteen little so small
minutes he must leave for the theater
and that son and grandson of a pig who
was the florist delayed delivery of the gar-
denia which must grace the left lapel of
his evening coat and was it not indis-
putably a fact that he could not go forth
without a fresh gardenia but certainly
what was it that the sale chameau was
thinking of that he thus procrastinated in
delivering that unmentionable flower till
this unspeakable time of night he was
jules de grandin he and not to be op-
pressed by any species of a goat who

called himself a florist but no it must
not be it should not be by blue he
personally would seek out the vile one
and tweak his ears pull his nose thump

his head most soundly he would--

  axin yer pardon sor nora mcgin-
nis broke in from the study door theres
a miss an misther tantavul to see ye
an-

  bid them be gone request that
they will fill their pockets full of rocks
and jump into the bay say that we will

not see-

  grand dieu - he cut his oratory
short-les enfants dans le bois

  truly there was something reminis-
cent of the babes in the wood about the
couple who had followed nora to the
study dennis tantavul looked even
younger ad more boyish than i remem-
bered him and the girl beside him was
so childish in appearance that i felt a
quick instinctive pity for her plainly
they were frightened too for they clung
together hand to hand like frightened
children going past a graveyard and in
their eyes was that look of helpless heart-
sick terror i had seen so often when blood
test and x-ray confirmed preliminary di-
agnosis of carcinoma

  monsieur mademoiselle the little
frenchman gathered his kimono and his
dignity about him in a single sweeping
gesture as he struck his heels together and
bowed stiffly from the hips i apologize
for my unseemly words were it not
that i have been subjected to a terrible
calamitous misfortune i should not so

far have forgotten myself as to-

  the girls quick smile cut through his
words we understand she reassured
we too have been through trouble
and have come to see doctor trow-
bridge-

  ah then i have permission to with-
the jest of warburg tantavul



draw he bowed again and turned
upon his heel but i called him back

  perhaps you can assist us i remarked
as i introduced the callers

  the honor is entirely mine ma-
demoiselle de grandin told her as he
raised her fingers to his lips you and

monsieur your brother-

  but hes not my brother said the
girl were cousins thats why we
called on doctor trowbridge

  de grandin tweaked the already
needle-sharp points of his little blond
mustache as he looked at her pardon-
nez-moi mademoiselle he begged i
have resided in your country but five little
years and perhaps i do not understand
the english fluently it is because you
and monsieur are cousins that you come
to see the doctor me i am dull and
stupid like a pig i fear i do not compre-
hend

  dennis tantavul replied its not be-
cause of the relationship doctor-not

entirely at any rate but because-

  he turned to me a look of mingled
fear and wonder in his eyes you were
at my fathers bedside when he died you
remember what he said about my marry-
ing arabella

  i nodded

  there was something-some ghastly
hidden threat-concealed in his warn-
ing he continued it seemed as
though he were jeering at me-daring

me to marry her yet-

  was there some provision in his
will i asked and

  yes sir there was the young man
answered here it is

  from his pocket he produced a sheet
of folded parchment opened it and indi-
cated a paragraph

   to my son dennis tantavul i give devise and
bequeath all my property of every kind and sort
real personal and mixed of which i may die
seized and possessed or to which i may be en-

titled in the event of his marrying arabella tan-
tavul but should he not marry the said arabella
tantavul then it is my will that he receive only
one-half of my estate the residue thereof to go to
the said arabella tantavul who has made her
home with me since childhood and occupied the
relationship of daughter to me

  hm i replied that looks as if he
really wanted you to marry your cousin

even though-

  and see here sir dennis inter-
rupted heres an envelope we found in
fathers papers

  sealed with red wax the packet of
heavy opaque parchment was addressed

   to my children dennis and arabella tantavul
to be opened by them upon the occasion of the
birth of their first child

  de grandins small blue eyes were
snapping with that flickering light they
showed when he was interested mon-
sieur dennis he said turning the thick
envelope over and over between his
small white hands doctor trowbridge
has told me something of your fathers
death-bed scene there is a mystery
about this business my suggestion is

you read this message now-

  no sir i wont do that the young
man interrupted my father didnt love
me-sometimes i think he hated me--but
i never disobeyed a wish that he ex-
pressed and i dont feel at liberty to do
so now it would be like breaking faith
with the dead but--he smiled a trifle
shamefacedly - fathers lawyer mr
bainbridge is out of town on business
and it will be his duty to probate the will
in the meantime id feel better if the
will and envelope were in other hands
than mine so we came to doctor trow-
bridge to ask him to take charge of them
till mr bainbridge comes from washing-
ton and meanwhile-

yes monsieur meanwhile de gran-
din prompted as the young man paused
you know human nature doctor


weird tales

dennis turned to me no one can see
farther into hidden meanings than the
man who sees humanity with its mask off
the way a doctor does do you think
father might have been delirious when
he warned me not to marry arabella

or- his voice trailed off to silence

but his troubled eyes were eloquent

  hm i moved uncomfortably in my
chair i cant see any reason for your
hesitation dennis that bequest of all
your fathers property in the event you
married arabella would seem to indicate
his true feelings i tried to make my
words convincing but the memory of
warburg tantavuls dying words dinned
in my ears there had been something
gloating in his voice as he told the picture
that his son and niece would marry

de grandin caught the hint of hesita-
tion in my tone monsieur he
asked will you not tell us of the ante-
cedents of your fathers warning doc-
tor trowbridge is perhaps too near to see
the situation clearly me i have no
knowledge of your father or your family
you and mademoiselle are strangely
like the will describes her as having
lived with you since childhood will you
kindly tell us how it came about

  the tantavuls were as he said
strangely similar in appearance anyone
might easily have taken them for twins
like as two plaster portraits from the
same mold were the delicate features of
their faces the small straight noses the
delicately curved lips the curling pale-
gold hair arabella wore hers in a
close-cut bob dennis hair was slightly
longer than the average mans strip off
his dinner clothes and put them on his
cousin encase him in the simple dinner
frock she wore and not one person in a
thousand could tell you which was man
and which was woman

  now once more hand in hand they sat
before us on the sofa and as dennis be-
gan speaking i saw that frightened
haunted look shine once again in their
light eyes

  do you remember us as children sir
he asked me

  yes i answered it must have
been some twenty years ago they called
me out to see you youngsters youd
just moved into the old stephens house
and there was a deal of gossip about the
strange gentleman from the west with
his two little children and his chinese
cook who greeted all the neighbors over-
tures with churlish rebuffs and never
spoke to anyone

  and what did you think of us sir
well i thought you and your sister
-as i thought her then-had as fine a
case of measles as id ever seen

  how old were we then do you re-
member

  oh you were something like two
years the little girl was half your age id
guess

  and do you remember the next time
you saw us

  yes you were somewhat older then
eight or ten id say that time it was
the mumps queer quiet little shavers
you were i remember i asked you if you
thought youd like a pickle and you an-
swered no it hurts 

  it did too sir every day father
made us eat one stood over us with a
whip till wed chewed and swallowed the
last morsel

  what

  the young folks nodded solemnly as
dennis answered yes sir every day
he said he wanted to check up the prog-
ress we were making

  for a moment he was silent then
doctor trowbridge if anyone treated
you with studied cruelty all your life-if
the jest of warburg tantavul



youd never had a kind word or gracious
act from that person in all your memory
then suddenly that person offered you a
favor-made it possible for you to gratify
your dearest wish and threatened to
penalize you if you failed to do so
wouldnt you be suspicious wouldnt you
suspect some sort of dreadful practical
joke

   i dont think that i quite understand
i answered

   very well then listen

  in all my life i cant remember ever
having seen my father smile not really
smile with friendliness humor or affec-
tion i mean my life-arabellas too
-was one long persecution at his hands
i was eighteen months old when we came
to harrisonville i believe but i still have
vague recollections of our western home
of a house set high on a hill overlooking
the ocean and a wall with climbing vines
and purple flowers on it and a pretty lady
who would take me in her arms and cud-
dle me against her breast and feed me
ice-cream from a spoon sometimes i
have a sort of recollection of a little baby
sister in that house too but these things
are so far back in babyhood that possibly
they never really were more than some
childish fancy which i built up for myself
and which i loved so dearly and so secret-
ly that they finally came to have a kind of
reality for me

  my real memories the things i can
recall with certainty began with a hur-
ried train trip through hot dry uncom-
fortable country with my father and a
strangely silent chinese servant and a
little girl they told me was my cousin ar-
abella little things make big impres-
sions on child-minds you know and of
all that trip the thing which i remember
most is seeing some indians standing on
the platform of a station with pottery
and blankets to sell my father had de-

scended from the car and walked beside
the train and i climbed down after him
and tried to run and take his hand i
stumbled over something on the platform
and fell and cut my forehead i called
to him for help but he didnt even turn
around and one of the indian women
lifted me to my feet and wiped the blood
from my face with her handkerchief
then when the bleeding didnt stop she
tore the handkerchief in half and used it
for a bandage it was the only act of
kindness that had been shown me for
many a year and i still have that me-
mento of a savage womans tenderness
somewhere among my childhoods treas-
ures doctor

   father treated arabella and me with
impartial harshness we were beaten
for the slightest fault and we had faults
a-plenty if we sat quietly we were ac-
cused of sulking and asked why we didnt
go and plag if we played and shouted
we were whipped for being noisy little
nuisances

   as we werent allowed to associate
with any of the children in the neighbor-
hood we made up our own games id
be geraint and arabella would be enid
of the dove-white feet or perhaps wed
play that i was arthur in the castle peril-
ous while she was the kindly lady of
the lake who gave him back his magic
sword and though we never mentioned
it both of us knew that whatever the ad-
venture was the false knight i contended
with was really my father but when
actual trouble came i wasnt an heroic
figure

t must have been thirteen years old
-i- when i had my last thrashing a
little brook ran through die lower part of
our land and the former owners had
widened it into a lily-pond the flow-
ers had died out years before but the out-


weird tales

lines of the pool remained and it was
our favorite summer play place we
taught ourselves to swim-not very well
of course but well enough-and as we
had no bathing-suits we used to go in in
our underwear when wed finished
swimming wed lie out in the sun until
our under-things were dry then don our
outer clothing one afternoon we were
splashing in the water happy as a pair of
baby beavers sporting in the woods and
nearer to shouting with laughter than
wed ever been before i think when my
father suddenly appeared upon the bank

   come out o there he ordered me
and there was a kind of sharp hard dry-
ness in his voice id never heard before
so thats the shameless way you spend
your time behind my back he asked as i
climbed up the bank in spite of all ive
done to keep you decent you dared to do
a thing like this

   why father we were only swim-
ming i began but he struck me on the
mouth

   be quiet you young rake he roared
til teach you

  before i realized his intention hed
cut a willow switch seized me by the
neck and thrust my head between his
knees then while he held me tight as in
a vise he flogged me with the willow lash
until the blood came through the skin and
stained my soaking cotton singlet then
he released me and kicked me back into
the pool as a heartless master might abuse
a dog

  as i said i wasnt an heroic figure
it was arabella who came to my rescue
helped me up the slippery bank and took
my head upon her shoulder poor den-
nie she said poor poor dennie it
was my fault dennie dear i never
should have let you take me in the water
then she kissed me--it was the first time
anyone had kissed me since the pretty lady

of my half-remembered dreams - and
told me well be married dear the
very day that uncle warburg dies and
ill be so sweet and good to you and you
will love me so that we shant remember
any of these cruel things that we have to
go through now

  we thought my fatherd gone away
but he must have stayed to see what we
would say for as arabella finished speak-
ing he stepped out from behind a clump
of rhododendron and then for the first
time i heard him laugh youll be mar-
ried will you he asked jeeringly well
youd better not youll both wish that
the earth had opened and swallowed you
if you ever dare to marry

  that was the last time he actually
struck me but from that time on he
seemed to go out of his way to invent
mental torments for us both we werent
allowed to go to public school but he had
a private tutor a little rat-faced man
named erickson come in and give us les-
sons and in the evening he would take
the book and make us stand before him
and recite if either of us failed to an-
swer promptly when he gave a problem
in arithmetic or demanded that we spell
a word or conjugate a french or latin
verb hed wither us with sarcasm and
always as a finish of his diatribe hed
bring the subject of our marriage up
jeering at us and hinting at some awful
consequence if we went through with
what wed set our hearts upon

  so doctor you can see he finished
why i cant help but suspect that this
provision of my fathers will is really
some sort of horrible practical joke hes
planned on us-almost as though hed
planned to force us into a situation which
would make it possible for him to laugh
at us from the grave

  i can understand your feelings boy
i answered but-
the jest of warburg tantavul



    but be baked and roasted in the hot-
test oven hell possesses interrupted
jules de grandin the wicked dead
ones funeral is at two tomorrow after-
noon nest-ce-pas

  tres bien at eight tomorrow eve-
ning-or earlier if it will be convenient
-you shall be married i shall esteem it
a favor if you permit that i shall be best
man doctor trowbridge will be there
to give the bride away and we shall have
a merry time by blue you shall go
upon a gorgeous honeymoon and learn
how sweet the joys of love can be-sweet-
er for having been so long denied par-
dieul and in the meantime we shall
keep those papers safe for you and when
your lawyer has returned i shall see that
he receives them in due course

  you fear the so unpleasant joke
mais non i think the joke is on the other
foot my friends and the laugh upon the
wicked old one who had thought himself
so clever



warburg tantavul was neither
widely known nor popular but the
solitude in which he had lived had invest-
ed him with mystery now the bars of
reticence were down and the walls of iso-
lation broken upward of a hundred
neighbors mostly women gathered in the
martin funeral chapel as the services be-
gan the afternoon sun beat softly
through the stained glass windows and
glinted upon the polished mahogany of
the pews here and there it touched
upon bright spots of color that marked a
flower a womans hat or a mans tie the
solemn hush was unbroken save for occa-
sional soft sibilations whatd he die
of did he leave much were the two
young folks his only heirs

  then the burial office lord thou
hast been our refuge from one generation

to another    for a thousand years in
thy sight are but as yesterday seeing it
is as a watch in the night    oh teach
us to number our days that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom  

  as the final amen sounded one of mr
martins young men glided forward
paused beside the casket for a moment
and made the stereotyped announcement
those who wish to say good-bye to mr
tantavul may do so at this time

  the grisly rite of passing by the bier
dragged on i would have left the place
for i had no wish to look upon the mans
dead face and folded hands but de gran-
din took me firmly by the elbow held me
back until the final curiosity-impelled
female had filed past the body then
steered me quickly to the casket

  the little frenchman paused beside the
bier and it seemed to me there was a hint
of irony in the smile that touched the cor-
ners of his mouth as he leant forward
eh bien my old one we know a secret
thou and i nest-ce-pas he asked the
silent form before us

  i swallowed back an exclamation of
dismay perhaps it was a trick of the un-
certain light possibly it was one of those
ghastly inexplicable things which every
doctor and embalrner meets with some-
time in his practise-the effect of desicca-
tion from formaldehyde the pressure of
some tissue gas within the body or some-
thing of the sort-at any rate as jules de
grandin spoke the corpses upper lids
drew back the fraction of an inch reveal-
ing slits of yellow eyes which seemed to
glare at us with mingled hate and fury

  good heavens come away i begged
it seemed as if he looked at us de gran-
din

  et puis-and if he did he asked me
as we left the chapel me i damn think
that i can trade him look for look my
friend he was clever that one i admit


weird tales

it but do not be mistaken jules de gran-
din is no ones imbecile



the wedding took place in the rectory
of st chrysostoms robed in stole
and surplice doctor bentley glanced be-
nignly from dennis to arabella then to
de grandin and me as he began dear-
ly beloved we are gathered together here
in the sight of god and in the face of this
company to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony  

his round and ruddy face grew slightly
stern as he continued if any man can
show just cause why they should not law-
fully be joined together let him now
speak or else hereafter for ever hold his
peace

  he paused the customary short dra-
matic moment and i thought i saw a
hard grim look spread on jules de gran-
dins face very faint and far-off seem-
ing so faint that we could scarcely hear
it but gaining steadily in strength there
came a high thin screaming sound
curiously it seemed to me to resemble
the long-drawn wailing shriek of a
freight trains whistle heard from miles
away upon a still and sultry summer
night weird wavering and ghastly now
it seemed to grow in shrillness though its
volume was no greater high so high
the human ear could scarcely register it
it beat upon our consciousness with a
frightful piercing sharpness it was like
a sick shrill scream of hellish torment
that set the tortured air to quivering till
we could not say if we were really hear-
ing it or if it were but a subjective ring-
ing in our heads

  i saw a look of haunted fright leap into
arabellas eyes saw dennis pale face go
paler as the strident whistle sounded
shriller and more shrill then as it seemed

i could endure the stabbing of that
needle-sound no longer it ceased abrupt-
ly giving way to blessed comforting
silence and through the silence came a
peal of chuckling laughter half breath-
less half hysterical wholly devilish huh
-hu-u-ub-htt-u-u-u-uh the final syl-
lable drawn out until it seemed almost a
groan

  the wind monsieur le cure it is the
wind said jules de grandin sharply
proceed to marry them if you will be so
kind

  the wind doctor bentley echoed
incredulously why i could have sworn

i heard somebody laugh but-

  it is the wind monsieur it plays
strange tricks at times the little french-
man answerecf his small blue eyes as
hard as frozen iron proceed if you
will be so kind we wait on you

  forasmuch as dennis and arabella
have consented to be joined together in
holy wedlock  i pronounce them man
and wife concluded doctor bentley and
de grandin ever gallant kissed the bride
upon the lips and before we could re-
strain him planted kisses upon both of
dennis cheeks

  parbleu i thought that we might have
the trouble for a time he told me as we
left the rector

  what was that awful shrieking noise
we heard i asked

  it was the wind my friend he an-
swered in a hard flat toneless voice
the ten times damned but wholly in-
effectual wind



o then little sinner weep and wail
for the burden of mortality that has
befallen thee weep wail cry and breathe
my little wrinkled one ha you will not
pardieu i say you shall

the jest of warburg tantavul



spanked the small red infants small red
posterior with the end of a towel wrung
out in hot water and as the smacking im-
pact sounded the tiny toothless mouth
opened to its fullest compass and a thin
high piping squall of protest sounded

   ah that is better mon petit ami the
little frenchman chuckled one can not
learn too soon that one must do as one is
told not as one wishes in this world
which you have entered look to him
mademoiselle he passed the wrig-
gling bawling morsel of humanity to the
nurse and turned to me as i bent above
the table where arabella tantavul lay
how does the mother good friend
trowbridge he asked

  ummp i answered noncommittal-
ly working furiously poor youngster
i added as arabella swathed in blankets
was trundled to her room she had a

pretty tough time of it but-

  but in the morning she will have for-
gotten de grandin cut in with a laugh
ha have i not seen it she will gaze
upon the little monkey-thing which i just
caused to breathe the breath of life and
vow it is the loveliest of all gods lovely
creatures cordieu she will hold it at her
tender breast and smile on it - she

will-

  sacre nom dun rat what is that
from the nursery where ensconced in
wire -trays twenty new-born fragments of
humanity slept or squalled there came a
sudden frightened scream-a womans
cry of terror

  we raced along the corridor reached
the glass-walled room and thrust the door
back taking care to open it no wider than
was necessary lest a draft disturb the
carefully conditioned air within the place

backed against the farther wall her
face gone gray with fright the nurse in
charge was staring at the skylight with
horror-widened eyes and even as we en-
w t-

tered she opened her lips to emit another
shriek

  stop it mademoiselle you are dis-
turbing your small charges de grandin
seized the horrified girls shoulder and
administered a shake then

  what is it that you saw mademoi-
selle he asked her in a whisper do
not be afraid to speak we shall respect
your confidence-but speak softly

  it - it was up there she pointed
with a shaking finger toward the black
square of the skylight theyd just
brought baby tantavul in and id laid
him in his crib when i thought i heard
somebody laughing oh - she shud-
dered at the recollection-it was awful
not really a laugh but something more
like a long-drawn-out hysterical groan
did you ever hear a child tickled to ex-
haustion-how he moans and gasps for
breath and laughs all at once i think
the fiends in hell must laugh like that
yes yes we understand de grandin
nodded shortly but tell us if you please
what happened next

  i looked around the nursery but i was
all alone here with the babies then it
came again louder this time and seem-
ingly right above me i looked up at the
skylight and-there it was

   it was a face sir-just a face with no
body to it and it seemed to float in mid-
air just above the glass then to dip down
against it like a childs balloon drifting
in the wind and it looked right past me
down at baby tantavul and laughed
again

  a face mademoiselle did you
say-

  yes sir a face-the most awful face
ive ever seen it was thin and wrinkled
and shriveled like a mummy and its
long gray hair hung down across its fore-
head and its eyes were yellow-like a
cats-and as they looked at baby tan-


weird tales

tavul they seemed to stretch and open till
the white of the balls glared all round the
yellow irises and the mouth opened not
widely but as though it were chewing
something that it relished-and it gave
that dreadful cackling jubilating laugh
again thats it i couldnt think before
but it seemed as if that bodiless head
were laughing with a sort of evil tri-
umph doctor de grandin

  hm the little frenchman tweaked
his tightly waxed mustache i should
not wonder if it did mademoiselle

  he turned to me and stay with her
if you please my friend he ordered i
shall see the supervisor and have her send
another nurse to keep her company i
shall request a special watch for the small
tantavul i do not think that there is
any danger but-mice do not play where
cats are wakeful

tsnt he just lovely arabella tanta-
-i- vul looked up from the small knob
of hairless flesh which rested on her
breast and ecstasy was in her eyes i
dont believe i ever saw so beautiful a
baby

  tiens madame his voice is excellent
at any rate de grandin answered with a
grin and from vhat one may observe
his appetite is excellent as well

  arabella smiled and patted the small
creatures back you know i never had
a doll in all my life she told us now
ive got this dear little mite and im go-
ing to be so happy with him oh i wish
uncle warburg were alive i know this
darling baby would soften even his hard
heart

  but i mustnt say such things about
him must i he really wanted dennis
and me to marry didnt he his will
proved that you think he wanted us to
marry doctor

  i am persuaded that he did madame

your marriage was his dearest wish his
fondest hope de grandin answered sol-
emnly

  i felt that way too he was harsh
and cruel to us while we were growing
up and preserved his stony-hearted atti-
tude to the end but underneath it all
there must have been some hidden streak
of kindness some lingering affection for
dennis and me or hed never have put

that clause into his will-

  nor have left this memorandum for
you de grandin interrupted drawing
from an inner pocket the parchment en-
velope which dennis had given him the
day before his fathers funeral

  the youthful mother started back as
though he menaced her with a live scor-
pion and instinctively her arms closed
protectively about the baby at her breast

  the-that-letter she faltered her
breath coming in short smothered gasps
id forgotten it oh doctor de gran-
din burn it dont let me see whats in
it im afraid

  it was a bright may morning without
sufficient breeze to stir the budding leaf-
lets on the maple trees outside but as de
grandin held the letter out i thought i
heard the sudden rustle of a wind beyond
the window not loud but shrewd and
keen like wind among the graveyard
evergreens in autumn and curiously
there was a note of soft malicious laugh-
ter mingled with it

  the little frenchman heard it too and
for an instant he looked toward the win-
dow and i thought i saw the flicker of
an ugly sneer take form beneath the ends
of his mustache

  open it madame he bade it is
for you and monsieur dennis and little
monsieur bebe here

  no-o i darent-

  tres bien then jules de grandin
does drawing out his penknife he slit
the jest of warburg tantavul



the heavy envelope pressed suddenly
against its ends so that its sides bulged
out and dumped its contents on the coun-
terpane ten twenty-dollar bills dropped
on the coverlet and nothing else
two hundred dollars arabella

gasped why-

  as a birthday gift for petit monsieur
dennis one surmises de grandin
smiled eh bien the old one had a sense
of humor underneath his ugly outward
shell it seems he kept you on the ten-
terhooks lest the message in this envelope
were one of evil import while all the
time it was a present of congratulation
but such a gift from uncle warburg
-i cant understand it arabella mur-
mured wonderingly

  perhaps it is as well madame he
answered as we rose to go be happy
with the gift and give your ancient uncle
credit for at least one act of kindliness
au voir

anged if i can understand it
either i told him as we left the
hospital if that old curmudgeon had
left a message berating them for fools for
having offspring it would have been
more in character but such a gift-well
im surprized

  amazingly de grandin halted in mid-
stride and laughed until the tears rolled
down his face parbleu my friend he
told me when he managed to regain his
breath i do not think that your surprize
is half so great as that of monsieur war-
burg tantavul



dennis tantavul regarded me with
misery-haunted eyes i just cant
understand it he admitted its all so

sudden so utterly-

  pardonnez-moi de grandin inter-

rupted from the door of the consulting-
room i could not help but hear your last
remark and if it is not an intrusion-

  not at all the young man answered
id like the benefit of your advice its
arabella and im dreadfully afraid that
she-

  non do not try it mon ami de
grandin warned do you give us the
symptoms let us make the diagnosis he
who acts as his own doctor has a fool for
a patient you know

  well then here are the facts this
morning arabella woke me up crying as
though her heart would break i asked
her what the trouble was and she looked
at me as if i were a stranger-no not
exactly that rather as if i were some
dreadful thing shed suddenly discovered
lying by her side her eyes were positive-
ly- round with horror and when i tried
to take her in my arms and comfort her
she shrank away as though i were infect-
ed with the plague

   oh dennie dont she begged and
positively cringed away from me then
she sprang out of bed and drew her ki-
mono about her as though she were
ashamed to have me see her in pajamas
and ran sobbing from the room

  presently i heard her crying in the
nursery and went down there to try and

comfort her- he paused and tears

started to his eyes she was standing
by the crib where little dennis lay look-
ing at him with tears streaming down her
cheeks and in her hand she held a long
sharp steel letter-opener poor little mite
poor little flower of unpardonable sin she
said weve got to go baby darling you
to limbo i to hell-oh god wouldnt
couldnt be so cruel as to damn you for
your parents sin-but well all three suf-
fer torment endlessly because we didnt
know

  she raised the knife to plunge it in


weird tales

the little fellows heart and he stretched
his baby hands out and laughed and
cooed as the sunlight glinted on the dead-
ly steel

   i was on her in an instant wrenching
the knife from her with one hand hold-
ing her against me with the other but she
fought me off

   dont touch me dennie please
please dont she begged i know its
deadly sin but i love you so my dear
that i cant resist you if i let you put your
arms around me

   i tried to kiss her but she hid her
face against my shoulder and moaned as
if in pain when she felt my lips against
her neck then she went suddenly limp
in my arms and i carried her uncon-
scious but moaning pitifully into her sit-
ting-room and laid her on the couch i
left sarah the nurse maid with her giv-
ing strict orders not to let her leave the
room till i returned cant you come
over right away

  de grandins cigarette had burned
down till it threatened his mustache and
in his small blue eyes was such a look
of murderous rage as i had not seen for
years bete he murmured savagely
sale cbameau species of stinking goat
this is his doing or jules de grandin is
a lop-eared fool come my friends let
us rush hasten fly i would talk with
madame arabella

aw suh shes gone the colored
nurse-maid told us when we
asked for arabella master dennie

  i thought i told you- dennis

began furiously but de grandin laid a
hand upon his arm

  softly if you please monsieur he
soothed la bonne did wisely though
she knew it not she was with the small
one all the while so no harm could come
to him was it not better so after what
you witnessed in the morning

  ye-es the other grudgingly admit-
ted i suppose so but arabella-

  let us see if we can find a trace of
her the frenchman interrupted look
do you miss her clothing

   dennis looked about the pretty chintz-
hung room yes he decided as he fin-
ished his inspection her dress was on
that lounge and her shoes and stockings
on the floor beneath it theyre all
gone

  so de grandin nodded distrait
as she appeared to be it is unlikely she
would have stopped to dress had she not
planned on going out

  friend trowbridge will you kindly
call police headquarters inform them of
the situation and ask to have all exits to
the city watched

  as i picked up the telephone he and
dennis started on a room-by-room in-
spection of the house

  find anything i asked as i hung up
the phone after notifying headquarters

  cordieu i should damn say yes de
grandin answered as i joined them in the
upstairs living-room look yonder if
you please my friend

  the room was obviously the intimate
apartment of the house electric lamps
under painted shades were placed beside
the big leather-upholstered chairs ivory-
enameled bookshelves lined the walls to
a height of four feet or so upon their
the jest of warburg tantavul



tops was a litter of gay unconsidered
little trifles-cinnabar cigarette boxes
bits of hammered brass old china blue
and red and purple glowed mellowly in
cabinets of mahogany its colors catching
up and accentuating the muted blues and
reds of an antique hamadan carpet a
paisley shawl was draped scarfwise across
the baby grand piano in the corner

  directly opposite the door a carven cru-
cifix was standing on the bookcase top
it was an exquisite bit of italian work
the cross of ebony the corpus of old
ivory and so perfectly executed that
though it was a scant four inches high
one could note the tense tortured mus-
cles the straining throat which overfilled
with groans of agony the brow all
knotted and bedewed with the cold sweat
of torment upon the statues thorn-
crowned head where it made a bright
iridescent halo was a band of gem-en-
crusted platinum a womans diamond-
studded wedding ring

  helas it is loves crucifixion whis-
pered jules de grandin

three months went by and though
we kept the search up unremittingly
no trace of arabella could be found
dennis tantavul installed a full-time
highly trained and recommended nurse in
his desolate house and spent his time
haunting police stations and newspaper
offices he aged a decade in the ninety
days since arabella left his shoulders
stooped his footsteps lagged and a look
of never-ending misery dwelt within his
eyes as he trod his daily via dolorosa a
prematurely old and broken man

  its the most uncanny thing i ever
saw i said to jules de grandin as we
walked through forty-second street
toward the west shore ferry we had
gone over to new york for some surgical
supplies and i do not drive my car in the

metropolis truck chauffeurs there are
far too careless and repair bills for
wrecked mudguards far too high how
a full-grown woman could evaporate that
way is something i cant understand i
added as we stepped briskly through the
bracing autumn air if it had happened
twenty years ago there might be some ex-
cuse for it but today with our radio
police-call systems and all the other mod-
ern-

  s-s-sthis sibilated admonition cut
me short that woman there my friend
observe her if you please he nodded
toward a female figure twenty feet ahead
of us

  i looked and wondered at his sudden
interest in the draggled hussy

  she was dressed in tawdry finery much
the worse for wear sleazy silken skirt
was much too tight cheap fur jaquette far
too short and snug high heels of her
satin slippers shockingly run over make-
up plastered on her cheeks and lips and
eyes and her short black hair fairly bris-
tled with untidiness beneath the rim of
her abbreviated hat written unmistak-
ably upon her was the nature of her call-
ing the oldest and least honorable pro-
fession known to womanhood

  well i answered tartly what
possible interest can you have in a-

  do not walk so fast he whispered as
his fingers closed upon my arm and do
not raise your voice i would that we
should follow her but i do not wish that
she should know

  the neighborhood was far from savory
and i felt uncommonly conspicuous as we
turned from forty-second street into
eleventh avenue in the wake of the
young strumpet followed her provoca-
tively swaying hips down two malodor-
ous blocks finally paused as she went in
the doorvay of a filthy unkempt room-
ing-house


weird tales

  with de grandin in the lead stepping
softly as a pair of cats we trailed the
woman through the dimly lighted bar-
ren hall and up a flight of shadowy un-
carpeted stairs we climbed two further
flights the last one letting into a sort of
little oblong foyer bounded on one end
by the stair-well on the farther extremity
by a barred and very dirty window and
on each side by two sets of sagging paint-
blistered doors on each of these was
pinned a card handwritten with the
many flourishes dear to the chirography
of the professional card-writer who still
does business in the poorer quarters of
our great cities the air was heavy with
the odor of cheap whisky stale bacon and
fried onions

  we made a hasty circuit of the hall
studying the cardboard labels on the
farthest door the notice read miss sie-

glinde

  mon dieu exclaimed de grandin
le mot propre

  eh i answered puzzled

  sieglinde do you not recall her
no-o i can not say i do the only
sieglinde i remember is the character in
wagners die walkiire who unwittingly

became her brothers mistress and-

  precisement let us enter if you
please without pausing to knock he
turned the handle of the door and stepped
across the threshold of the squalid room

  the woman sat upon the bed her hat
pushed backward from her brow a
cracked and dirty tumbler in one hand a
whisky bottle poised above it get out
she ordered thickly  get out o here-i
dont want--- a gasp cut short her
utterance and she turned her head away
then

  get fell out o here you lousy rum-
mies she half screamed who dye
think you are breakin into a ladys room
like this get out or-

  de grandin eyed her steadily and as
her strident order wavered

  madame arabella we have come to
take you home he told her softly

  good lord man youre crazy i ex-
claimed arabella this-

  precisely my good friend this is
madame arabella tantavul whom we
have sought these many months in vain
crossing the room in two quick strides
he seized the cringing woman by the
shoulders and turned her face up to the
window i looked and felt a sudden
swift attack of nausea

  he was right thin to emaciation her
face already lined with the deep-bitten
scars of dissipation the woman on the
bed was arabella tantavul though the
shocking change wrought in her features
and the black dye in her hair had dis-
guised her so i never would have recog-
nized her

  we have come to take you home ma
pauvre he repeated your hus-
band--

  my husband her reply was half a
scream oh dear god as if i had a

husband-

  and a little one who needs you the
frenchman interrupted you can not

leave him so madame-

  i cant ah thats where youre mis-
taken doctor i can never see him
again in this world or the next please
please go away and forget you found
me or ill have to drown myself-ive
tried it twice already but my courage
failed but if you try to take me back

or tell dennis that you saw me-

  tell me madame he broke in was
not your flight caused by a visitation from
the dead

her faded brown eyes widened
how did you know she asked
tiens one may make surmises he
the jest of warburg tantavul



replied will you not tell us just what
happened i think there is a way out of
your difficulties

  there isnt any way she muttered
dully and her head sank listlessly upon
her chest he planned his work too
well all thats left for me is death-and
damnation afterward

  but if there were a way-if i could
show it to you

  can you repeal the laws of god

  i am a very clever person perhaps i
can discover an evasion if not an absolute
repeal now tell me how and when
did monsieur your late but not lamented
uncle come to you

  the night before - before i went
away i woke up about midnight think-
ing i heard a cry from dennies nursery
i rose to go to him and when i reached
the room where he was sleeping i saw
my uncles face glaring at me through the
window it seemed to be illuminated by
a sort of inward hellish light for it stood
out against the darkness like a jack-o-
lantern and it smiled an awful smile at
me arabella it said and i could see
its thin dead lips writhe back as though
its teeth were burning-hot ive come to
tell you that your marriage is a mockery
and a lie the man you married is your
brother and the child you bore is doubly
illegitimate you cant continue living
with them arabella that would be an
even greater sin than the one you have
committed you must leave them leave
them right away or-once more his lips
crept back until his teeth were bare-or i
shall come to visit you each night and
when the baby has grown old enough to
understand ill tell him of his parents
sin take your choice my dear leave them
and let me go back to my grave in peace
or stay and see me every night and know
that i will tell your son when he is old
enough to understand and if i do it

hell loathe and hate you for the things
you are and curse the day you bore him
 and youll promise never to come
near dennis or the baby if i go i asked

  he promised and i staggered back to
bed where i fell fainting

next morning when i wakened i was
sure that it had been a dream but when

i	looked at dennis and my own reflection
in the glass i knew it was no dream but
a dreadful visitation from the dead

  it was then that i went mad i tried
to kill my baby and when dennis stopped
me i watched my chance to run away
came over to new york and took to this
she looked significantly around the mis-
erably furnished room i knew theyd
never look for arabella tantavul among
the sisters of the pavement i was safer
from pursuit right here than if id been
in europe or in china

  but madame-de grandins voice
was vibrant with shocked reproof-that
which you saw was nothing but a dream
a most unpleasant dream i grant but
still a dream look in my eyes madame
she raised her eyes to his and i saw
his pupils widen as a cats do in the dark
saw a line of white outline the cornea
and responsive to his piercing gaze be-
held her brown eyes set in a fixed stare
first as though in fright then with a glaze
almost like that of death

  attend me madame arabella he
commanded softly you are tired -
grand dieu how tired you are you
have suffered greatly but you are about
to rest your memory of that night is
gone so is all memory of all things which
have occurred since you will move and
eat and sleep as you are bidden but of
what takes place until i bid you wake you
will retain no recollection do you hear
me madame arabella

  i hear she answered softly in a
small tired voice


weird tales

  bien lie down my little poor one
lie down rest and dream dream happy
dreams of love sleep rest dream and
forget

  will you be good enough to phone
to doctor wyckoff he asked me we
shall place her in his sanitarium wash
this sacre dye out of her hair and nurse
her back to health then when all is
ready we can bear her home and have
her take up life-and love-where she
left off none shall be the wiser this
chapter in her life is closed and sealed
for ever

  each day ill call upon her and renew
hypnotic treatments that she may simulate
the mild but curable mental case which
we shall tell the good wyckoff she is
when finally i release her from hypnosis
her mind will be entirely cleared of that
bad dream which nearly wrecked her
happiness



arabella tantavul lay upon the
t sofa in her charming upstairs liv-
ing-room an orchid negligee trimmed in
white marabou about her slender shoul-
ders an eiderdown rug tucked around her
feet and knees her wedding ring was
once more on her finger pale with a
pallor not to be disguised by the most
skilfully applied cosmetics and with
deep violet circles underneath her amber
eyes she lay back listlessly drinking in
the cheerful warmth which emanated
from the fire of apple-logs that snapped
and crackled on the hearth two months
of rest in doctor wyckoffs sanitarium
had erased the marks of dissipation from
her face even as the skilled ministrations
of beauticians had restored the yellow
luster to her pale-gold hair but the list-
lessness which followed her complete
breakdown was still upon her like the
weakness from a fever

  i cant remember anything about my
illness doctor trowbridge she told me
with a weary little smile but vaguely i
connect it with some dreadful dream i
had and-she wrinkled her smooth
forehead in an effort at remembrance-
i think i had a rather dreadful dream
last night but-

  ah-ha de grandin leant abruptly
forward in his chair his little mustache
twitching like the whiskers of an irritated
tom-cat what was it that you dreamed

  i-dont-know she answered slow-
ly odd isnt it how you can remem-
ber that a dream was so unpleasant but
cant recall its details somehow i con-
nect uncle warburg with it but-

  parbleu your uncle again ah
hah he makes me to be so mad that
one

tt is time we went my friend de
-s grandin told me as the tall clock in
the hall beat out its tenth deliberate
stroke we have important duties to per-
form

  for goodness sake i protested
where are you going at this time of
night

  where but to monsieur tantavuls
he answered with a smile that had small
humor in it i am expectant of a vis-
itor tonight and-we must be ready for
him

  when he was in a mood like this i
knew that questioning would be a waste
of breath accordingly i drove him to the
tantavuls in silence knowing he would
have an explanation when he deemed the
time had come

  is madame arabella sleeping he
asked as dennis met us in the hall

  yes like a baby answered the young
husband ive been sitting by her all
evening and i dont believe shes even
turned in bed
the jest of warburg tantavul



  and did you keep the window closed
as i requested

  yes sir closed and latched

  bien await us here mon brave we
shall rejoin you presently

  he led the way to arabellas bedroom
removed the wrappings from a bulky par-
cel and displayed the object thus dis-
closed with the air of a magician about
to do a trick you see him he de-
manded proudly is he not a beauty
why-what the deuce-its nothing
but a window-screen i answered

  ah but it is made of copper he in-
formed me as though explaining some-
thing of inordinate importance

 well-

  well pardieu i shall say it is well
it is very exceedingly well my friend
observe him how he works

  from his kit bag he produced a reel of
insulated wire an electrical transformer
and a set of tools working quickly he
passe-partouted the screens wooden
frame with electricians tape then
plugged a wire into a near-by lamp sock-
et connected it with the transformer and
from the latter led a double strand
of cotton-wrapped wire to the screen
this he clipped firmly to the copper
meshes and led a third wire to the metal
grille of the heat register last of all
he filled a bulb-syringe with water and
sprayed the screen from it repeating the
dousings till the woven copper sparkled
like a cobweb in the morning sun now
monsieur le revenant i damn think we
are ready for you he announced sur-
veying his handiwork with every sign of
satisfaction

  we waited quietly for something like
an hour then de grandin rose and bent
above the bed where arabella slept
madame

  the girl stirred faintly murmuring
some half-audible response and

  in half an hour you will rise he told
her in a low insistent voice you will
put on your robe and stand before the
window but on no account will you go
near it or lay hands on it should any-
one address you from outside you will
reply but you will not remember what
you say or what is said to you

  he motioned me to follow him and
we left the room taking station in the
hallway just outside

how long we waited i have no idea
perhaps it was an hour perhaps
less at any rate the silent vigil seemed
unending and i raised my hand to stifle
a tremendous yawn when

  yes uncle warburg i can hear you
we heard arabella saying softly in the
room beyond the door

  we tiptoed to the entry arabella
tantavul stood before the window look-
ing fixedly at its darkened square and
beyond her framed in the window-casing
as a masterpiece of horror might be
framed for exhibition glared the face of
warburg tantavul

  it was dead there was no doubt about
it in the sunken cheeks the pinched-in
nose and the yellowish-gray skin there
showed the evidence of death and early
putrefaction but dead though it was it
was also animated with a dreadful sort
of life the eyes were glaring horribly
as though illuminated with some inward
phosphorescence and they bulged for-
ward in their sunken sockets as though
a throttling hand were clutching at the
dead things throat the lips were red-
red as rouge-but they were not red with
life they were dead and painted with
fresh blood

  you hear me do ye he demanded
and the ruddy foam-flecked lips writhed
across his yellow teeth then listen
girl you broke your bargain with me


weird tales

  now im come to keep my threat every
time you kiss your husband-a shriek
of bitter laughter cut his words and his
staring starting eyes half closed with
hellish merriment-or the child you love
so well my shadow will be on you
youve kept me out thus far but some

day ill get in and--

  once more the foam-dyed lips writhed
across the gleaming teeth and the lean
dead jaw dropped downward then
snapped up as though it champed on liv-
ing flesh then suddenly the whole ex-
pression of the corpse-face changed sur-
prize incredulous delight anticipation
as before a feast were pictured on it
why-its cachinnating laughter sent a
chill down my spine-why youre win-
dows open now youve changed the
screen and i can enter

  slowly like a childs balloon stirred by
a vagrant wind the dreadful face moved
closer to the window and i noted with a
nauseated start that it was bodiless
closer closer to the screen it came and
arabella tantavul gave ground before it
shuddering with nameless dread putting
up her hands to shield her eyes from the
laughing thing which menaced her

  sapristi swore de grandin softly
his fingers clenched about my elbow till
they numbed my arm come on my
old and evil one come a little nearer

only one so little tiny step and-

  the dead thing floated closer now
its mocking mouth and shriveled pointed
nose were pressing against the screen
now they seemed to filter through the

copper meshes like a wisp of fog-

  there came a blinding flash of blue-
white flame the cracking sputtering
gush of fusing metal a wild despairing
shriek which ended ere it fairly started in
a sob of mortal torment and the sharp
and acrid odor of burned flesh

  arabella-darling-is she all right

dennis tantavul came charging up the

stairs i thought i heard a scream-

  you did monsieur de grandin an-
swered but i do not think that you will
ever hear its repetition unless you are
so unfortunate as to go to hell when your
earthly pilgrimage is ended

  what was it began dennis but de
grandin stopped him with a smile

  one who thought himself a clever
jester pressed his jest a bit too far he
answered enigmatically meantime look
to madame your wife see how peaceful-
ly she lies upon her bed her time for
evil dreams is past my friend be kind
to her do not forget that a woman loves
to have a lover even though he is her
husband he bent and kissed the sleep-
ing girl upon the brow and

  au voir my little lovely one he
murmured then to me

  come trowbrdige my good friend
our work is finished here let us leave
them to their happiness



jules de grandin poured an ounce or
so of couvoisier into a lotus-bud
shaped brandy sniffer and passed the gob-
let back and forth beneath his nose in-
haling the rich fragrance of the brandy
morbleu old omar had it right he
told me with a grin what is it that the
distillers buy one-half so precious as the
stuff they sell

  and when you get through misquot-
ing poetry perhaps youll deign to tell me
what its all about i countered

  perhaps i shall he answered at-
tend me if you please you will recall
that this annoying monsieur who was
dead yet not dead appeared several
times and grinned most horribly through
the window through the window please
remember at the hospital where he near-
the jest of warburg tantavul



ly caused the garde-malade to have a fit
he laughed and mouthed at her through
the glass skylight which was tightly
closed when he first appeared and threat-
ened madame arabella he also spoke to
her through the window and-

  but the window was open i pro-
tested

  yes but screened he answered with
a smile screened with iron if you
please

  what difference did that make to-
night i saw him force his features part-
way through the screen-

  precisement he agreed but it was
a screen of copper i saw to that

  then seeing my bewilderment iron
is of all metals the most earthy he ex-
plained it and its derivative steel are
so instinct with the essence of the earth
that creatures of the spirit world can not
abide its presence the legends tell us
that when solomons temple was con-
structed no tool of iron was employed be-
cause even the friendly spirits whose help
he had enlisted could not perform their
tasks in close proximity to iron the
werewolf a most unpleasant sort of crea-
ture which is half a demon can be slain
by a sword or spear of steel the witch
can be detected by the pricking of an iron
pin-never by a pin of brass

  very well when first i thought about
this evil dead ones reappearances i
noted that each time he stared outside the
window glass apparently he could not
pass-and glass contains a modicum of
iron iron window-wire stopped him
he are not a ghost then i inform me
they are things of spirit only they are
thoughts made manifest this one is a
thing of hate but also of some physical
material as well he is composed in part
of the emanations from that body which
lies in the tomb and for which the devil
of hell and the devils of decay fight each

for their due shares voila if he have
physical properties he can be destroyed
by physical means

  and so i set my trap i procure a
screen of copper through which he could
make entrance to the house - but i
charged it with electricity--i increase the
potential of the current with a step-up
transformer to make assurance doubly
sure-and then i wait for him to try to
enter and electrocute himself

  but is he really destroyed i asked
dubiously

  as the candle-flame when one has
blown on it he replied he was-how
do you say it-short-circuited no con-
vict in the chair at sing sing ever died
more thoroughly than that one did to-
night my friend

  it seems queer though he should
have come back from the grave to haunt
those two poor kids and break up their
marriage when he really wanted it i
murmured wonderingly

  wanted it he echoed ha yes he
wanted it as the hunter wants the bird to
step within his snare

  but he gave them such a handsome

present when little dennis was bom-

  oh my good kind trusting friend
are you too deceived he laughed
deceived--

  but certainly that money which i
gave to madame arabella was my own
i put it in that envelope

  then what was in the message which
he really left

  the little frenchman sobered sudden-
ly  it was a dreadful thing that wicked
jest he played on them he told me sol-
emnly the night that monsieur den-
nis left that packet with me i determined
that the old one meant him injury so
when he went i steamed the package
open and destroyed monsieur warburgs


weird tales

message from it in it he made plain
the things which dennis thought that he
remembered

  long and long ago monsieur tanta-
vul lived in san francisco his wife was
seven years his junior and a pretty joy-
ous thing she was she bore him two
fine children a little boy and girl and on
them she bestowed the love which he
could not appreciate his business took
him often from the city but when he
went away he set a watch on her

  ha the eavesdropper seldom hears
good tidings of himself and he who
spies on others often wishes that he did
not so his surliness his evil temper
his reproaches without praise had driven
her to seek release she met and loved
another man and though she shrank
from seeking freedom in that way at last
she yielded to his importunities and was
feady to escape when master bluebeard-
tantavul suddenly returned

  eh bien but he had planned a pretty
scheme of vengeance his baby girl he
spirited away gave her for keeping to
some mexicans then told his wife his
plan he would bring the children up as
strangers to each other and when they
grew to full estate he would marry them
and keep their consanguinity a secret till
they had a child then break the dreadful
truth to them thereafter they would
live on bound together for their chil-
drens sake and fearing the worlds cen-
sure their consciences would cause them
ceaseless torment and the very love which
they had for each other would be like fet-
ters forged of white-hot steel binding
them in a prison-house from which there
offered no release

  when he had told her this his wife
went mad and heartless as a devil out
of hell he thrust her into an institution
left her there to die and took his babies
with him moving to new jersey and

permitting them to grow to manhood and
womanhood together ceaselessly striving
to guide them toward the altar knowing
always that his vengeance would be sated
when his vile design had been accom-
plished

but great heavens man theyre
brother and sister i exclaimed in horror
perfectly he answered coolly they
are also husband and wife and father
and mother

  but-but- i stammered utterly

at a loss for words

  but me no buts good friend he
bade i know what you would say
their child ah bah consider did not
the kings of ancient times repeatedly take
their own sisters to wife and were not
their offspring sound and healthy but
certainly did not both darwin and
wallace fail to find foundation for the
doctrine that cross-breeding between
healthy people with clean blood is pro-
ductive of inferior offspring look at
the little monsieur dennis were you
not blinded by your silly training and tra-
dition - did you not know his parents
near relationship - you would have no
hesitation in pronouncing him an unus-
ually fine and healthy child

  besides he added earnestly they
love each other not as brother and sister
but as man and woman he is her hap-
piness she is his and little monsieur
dennis is the happiness of both why
destroy this joy-le bon dieu knows they
earned it by a joyless childhood-when
i can preserve it for them by simply keep-
ing silent

 but-

  but what you have learned you
learned under the seal of your profes-
sion he warned me solemnly you
can not tell i will not

  meantime - he poured himself
another drink-i thirst

this is not a sex story but is an ingenious tale of west indian voodoo and a
millionaires strange scheme for vengeance on the actress
whom he had married

 twenty-thirty years ago-a night in the haitian jungle-when was it

lady

aked

arion van orton finished
packing her dressing-case
opened her purse to make sure
that her steamer tickets were still there
took one last look in the mirror and then
descended the wide polished staircase of
the van orton mansion for the last time
gorham the butler met her at the door

  madam will be gone for the week
end he asked

  including the week end mrs van
orton amended

  the town car was waiting at the curb
he helped her into it and stood waiting
at the door while she settled back com-
fortably she looked up questioningly

                                     


weird tales

  will madam leave any message
gorham asked

   oh she sighed just say ive gone
for an indefinite stay madam
languidly mrs van orton motioned
to the chauffeur no she said just
say ive gone

  the purring motor drew away only
gorhams eyes moved as he watched it
turn the corner with a start he recov-
ered himself and closed his mouth
well he said as he walked up the
stairs a greater degree of volubility
had returned to him when he reported the
incident to the cook

just for the moment gilda ransomes
life had crystallized into one des-
perate wish if she couldnt scratch her
thigh this instant she would go stark
raving mad a few hours earlier she had
thought that if she didnt have breakfast
life would be insupportable hunger
was bad enough-but this itch

  you may rest now said mr blake
the well-known designer of the fleshier
covers of the naughtier magazines he
turned away and lit a cigarette gilda
applied her nails to her skin as she went
behind a screen and drewt on a dressing-
gown

  she began to think about her hunger
again she was not hungry because she
was on a reducing diet-she needed
neither reduction nor addition every
artist for whom she had posed had agreed
that her figure was just the type-pre-
sumably the type that sells magazines
and her face was certainly no less at-
tractive than her figure-which is an em-
phatic statement

   she felt starved because influenza had
kept her idle for three weeks and during
that time her money had run out she
had never been one to save

   later in the day she fainted while try-

ing to hold a tiring pose mr blake was
very much annoyed and he determined
that in the future he would use stronger
if less perfect models

in the west indies there were many
many men who would have testified to
the cleverness of jeremiah van orton as
a lad of twenty he had come to curagao
from holland and for forty-five years
thereafter he had remained in the indies
then he had decided that he was too rich
and too old to go on working that was
his first mistake if he had kept his nose
to the grindstone he would not have
come to new york he would not have
met marion martin the actress he
would not have made a fool of himself

  van orton sat huddled in front of an
open fire and thought the matter over in
this climactic hour he paused to review
his life and works

  vivid flashes of memory confused
his efforts to keep his thoughts order-
ly a tongue of flame licked around
a log in the fireplace a thread of
scented smoke curled into the room   
a night in the haitian jungle-when was
it twenty-thirty years ago a black
wench was dying for no reason the
doctor said for superstition voo-
doo    marion martin had been con-
vincing she had said that she was tired
of young men-men whom she could not
respect she had said a man was not in
his prime until sixty or seventy until
then he was callow unproved not wor-
thy of admiration or love he knew
nothing of metropolitan people he had
been attracted to her and presently he
had believed and loved her    what
was that about the natives destroying with
such care every fingernail cutting every
hair one had to be careful-voodoo
was strong in the west indies    he
had given marion his honorable name
naked lady



and a million dollars besides even if
she hadnt pretended to love him he
might have done the same she had
given him the illusion of youth he had
thought of a future with her for her he
might have lived for ever

  and now he was nothing but an old
fool who was going to die but so was
she oh yes so was she

  the idea of following his wife to
wherever she might come to rest and mur-
dering her there never occurred to jer-
emiah van orton he was too tired and
feeble for such a melodramatic role one
did not spend a lifetime in the indies for
nothing he was clever except for this
little interlude of marriage he had always
been clever he would find a way a
good way-a safe way for him an un-
pleasant way for her

  jeremiah van orton could always
think better among his beautiful collec-
tion of paintings he went to the draw-
ing-room and drew up a chair before a
hobbema landscape there he remained
until he had planned all the details of his
vengeance

in the restaurant of the hotel lafay-
ette michael bonze sat across the
table from his friend pierre vanneau
and cursed the age in which they both
were bom

  what does art mean in the twentieth
centurv he asked rhetorically noth-
ing people talk about the dynamic
beauty of a new stream-lined toilet seat
or the empire state building or take
surrealism daubs-damn it-daubs by
clumsy color-blind house-painters picas-
so eats while i starve cocteau is the
white-haired bov while i worry myself
bald people dont want things to look
like what they are-they want them to
look like the sublimation of the mood of
the essence of the psychological reaction

to what they might be if they werent
what they are oh i know it sounds like
sour grapes but i wouldnt mind if it
werent for the fact that im a painter
with greater talent than any of them if
i were living in henry the eighths time
people would now be collecting bonzes
instead of holbeins damn the twen-
tieth century

  look said vanneau have you ever
painted a beautiful young girl you
know-curves and flowing hair and so
on

  bonze slapped his big hand down on
the table top and the dishes jumped
are you trying to be insulting he bel-
lowed do you take me for henry
clive-or-or zuloaga maybe no
no i havent painted any pretty valen-
tines of beautiful young girls

  vanneau murmured into his coffee
cup rubens did tiepolo did titian
did   

  oh shut up said bonze you
know what i meant people wont take
that sort of thing from a modern artist-
it isnt art art is old wrinkled-up men
or nauseous arrangements of dried fish
and rotten apples or anything sufficiently
ugly and nasty

  how do you know that is so van-
neau asked what modern artist has
dared to paint a pretty picture i dont
know of anyone since greuze and his
picture sold well enough

  well- bonze began doubtfully

  and look vanneau continued in
this jaded age sex appeal is important
important it is everything he spread
out his arms in an all-embracing gesture
and what do you create for an avid pub-
lic a public that waters at the mouth
at the very mention of nudism or mae
west you give them old men and dried
fish dont weep on my shoulder-you
give me a pain


weird tales

  bonze was still feeling a little sorry
for himself i give meyergold the crit-
ic a pain too today he came to the
studio and said he didnt think i was
ready just yet to have a show he
stayed about fifteen minutes damn
him

on the morning following his wifes
departure jeremiah van orton en-
gaged the services of a mr moses win-
kler a student of biology who was prom-
ised double payment if he could manage
to get through his work without asking
questions he was led into a ladys bou-
doir and told that he must go over the
entire room with a microscope in order to
collect every human remain no matter
how small or apparently unimportant

  mr van orton watched every move
he made somehow moses did not like
the eagerness with which the old man
greeted each new find it made him quite
nervous

  when moses finished his work he was
able to deliver to his employer a surpriz-
ing number of small envelopes on each
of which he had written a description of
the contents one held grains of dust
from a nail-file another an eyelash on
a brush in the bathroom he had found a
few flakes of skin a minute drop of
blood had been discovered on a handker-
chief in the laundry basket    the
list went on

  moses was paid and dismissed he
was glad to go

  van orton added the envelopes to a
collection he had made of all the photo-
graphs of his wife that she had left in
the house he looked long at the relics
before locking them safely away

  it is not a great deal he muttered
to himself but in haiti ive known them
to do it with less-much less

within a month old mr van or-
ton had become the scandal of
sutton place every day from nine until
six a constant stream of handsome young
women entered and left his house much
to gorhams bewilderment and disap-
proval it had become his masters custom
to sit in the drawing-room and interview
the young ladies one by one discreet
inquiries elicited the fact that they were
artists models answering a newspaper
advertisement

  what gorham had asked the cook
does the old reprobate want with a
model and if he wants a model why
is he so hard to satisfy he must have
seen two hundred of them already and
hes not kept one over ten minutes

  it was the cooks considered opinion
that jeremiah van orton was an inde-
cent dirty old man who should be put
away where he couldnt do any harm

  the procession of applicants ended
when gilda ransome was ushered into
the drawing-room gorham was called and
told that no more models would be seen
he breathed a sigh of relief and stole a
glance at the young lady who had been
chosen from among so many gorham
had a shock - for a second he had
thought she was mrs van orton it was
a startling resemblance

ichael bonze sat in his studio win-
dow and looked at the dreary
square with bare trees and muddy streets
it was a picture of his mood his money
was running low and he was thinking
that he ought to be putting in a stock of
canned baked beans instead of buying a
half-case of gin there was nothing he
wanted to paint he hated painting and
art patrons and critics

  a sedate foreign limousine came
splashing along the street below and
stopped at the door to his studio building

                    w t-
naked lady



the sight didnt make him any happier
art patron he said with a wealth of
expression in his voice

  in a moment there was a knock on the
coor and michael opened it to admit
jeremiah van orton

   you are michael bonze he asked
bonze admitted his identity although
just then he was not particularly proud
of it the caller presented his card with
the question you have heard of me
yes said bonze ive heard you
have quite a large collection of flemish
paintings will you take a chair

  van orton launched into his business
at once i have come to see you he
said because i want a special kind of
painting which you do better than anyone
i know

  thank you michael murmured and
crossed his fingers behind him

   not that i like the sort of painting
ru do the old man continued on the
contrary i dislike it intensely it is dull
sriridess-i might say insipid

    oh do say insipid said michael

also sar goodbye sir at once

  gcrae come said van orton calm-
ly  this is no time for compliments
i am not here to discuss art but to make
tou a proposition which you will find
hihlv beneficial financially

  bonze had a sudden vision of rows of
canned baked beans and he held his
tongue

   for a particular reason which is none

c tur affair i wish you to paint a life-
size nude of a model i have selected the
pose makes very little difference but i
suggest that y a have her reclining on a
dtae-lngue for background you may
use drapery or anything you please-it is
of no importance

  bonze asked would you mind telling
me why i should have been chosen for
this work

   w t-

  because your painting is so realisti-
cally accurate that not even a colored pho-
tograph can compare with it i dont
consider it art but it will serve my pur-
pose

  after all a man had to have some
pride im not interested said bonze

  no shade of disappointment crossed
the old mans face no no he agreed
of course not but you would perhaps
be interested in fifteen thousand dollars
a third payable now

  michael resisted an impulse to jump
up and kiss the beneficent bald head
write the check and send me the
model he said ill start today
good said van orton but now i
must lay down two important conditions
first i will give you a number of photo-
graphs of a young woman who bears
some resemblance to the model you will
use i want you to study the pictures very
closely because your painting must look
more like them than like the model

  but why michael protested why
cant i simply paint a portrait of the sub-
ject of the photographs it would be a
lot more satisfactory and easier

                              j

  if the job were as easy as that
i wouldnt be paying you fifteen thousand
dollars van orton reached in the pock-
et of his coat and withdrew ten or twelve
little envelopes the second request
that i must make is this he continued
each of these packets contains a pinch
of powder they are plainly marked
hair nails skin lips and so on now
when you mix your paints for these vari-
ous details you must add these powders
as indicated you are a man of honor
certainly said the very mystified
painter

  you will give me your word that this
will be done according to my instruc-
tions

  michael nodded


weird tales

  very well here is my check for five
thousand dollars hurry your work as
much as you can with safety and let me
know the instant it is done van orton
went to the door i brought the model
with me in the car i will send her up
with the photographs good day

  bonze collapsed into a chair as the
door closed

spring has come to venice and the
piazza san marco has a freshly
washed and burnished look mrs van
orton sits at florians on the edge of the
square sipping a pernod she feels that
gods in his heaven and life is just a
bowl of cherries

  mrs van orton has a figure that looks
well im anything but its effectiveness in-
creases in inverse ratio with the amount
of clothing she wears hence to some ex-
tent venice and the lido when she
walks along the beach this summer the
women will turn away and the men will
turn toward her the women will say
who is that doll-faced american in the
daring bathing-costume the men are
discreet on the lido-they will say noth-
ing but they will look

and spring has come to washington
 square the old trees are begin-
ning to think about their easter clothing
probably they will decide that the well-
dressed tree will wear a very light and
delicate chartreuse feathers too may
be worn

  michael bonze looked up from his
painting darling he said youre
the best work ive ever done and
youre just about finished

  thank goodness said gilda ran-
some may i move now

  go ahead he said get up and
well make some coffee

  he put down his palette and brushes

and helped her into her kimono kissing
as he did so the back of her neck

  i wonder he said if i could have
done such a good portrait if i hadnt
fallen in love with you i owe a lot to
old van orton if it hadnt been for
him-and for pierre vanneau-

  why pierre vanneau she asked

  michael smiled in memory of his an-
noyance it was he who first suggested
that i paint beautiful women i was fu-
rious

  so shall i be said gilda if you
dare to paint any woman but me

  never fear he laughed there
will be no one but you ill paint you as
everything from medusa to the virgin
mary

  i might make a medusa said gilda

  later in the day the picture was fin-
ished to the immense satisfaction of both
artist and model

  the next morning michael arose be-
fore gilda was awake he wanted to
look at the portrait in the cold light of
dawn without he told himself undue
self-praise he found it good-very good
maybe it wasnt modern maybe the style
wasnt original perhaps it wasnt spon-
taneous but the draftsmanship the
color the texture the composition-that
was all perfect no one could deny it
it would take no violent stretch of the
imagination to conceive the beautiful
creature rising from her couch and step-
ping lightly down from the canvas to the
floor

  bonze thought it wasnt fair that this
his best work was destined to be hung in
a dark lonely house among a lot of
gloomy flemish paintings for the exclu-
sive pleasure of a solitary old dutchman
after all art was for the masses if
meyergold could see this hed sing a dif-
ferent tune if it werent for the money
hed never let van orton have the picture
naked lady



-the insulting old idiot he wouldnt
appreciate it anyway it wouldnt have
made any difference to him if the picture
had been good or bad all he wanted
was a likeness

  on the heels of this reflection bonze
realized in a flash of inspiration how he
could keep his picture he would make
a copy and give that to van orton
naturally it wouldnt be so good as the
original but what of that he hadnt
promised to deliver a masterpiece of
course there was the matter of those little
packets of powder-hed used it all in
the original-but-well it was silly any-
way

  he woke gilda with a shout and told
her his plan ill have the thing fin-
ished by the end of the week then ill
get my check and well go right down to
the city hall and be married

  gilda looked at the clock on the bed
table is this a nice hour to propose to
a girl she groaned and pulled the cov-
ers over her head

  whistling loudly and cheerfully
michael started to work

jeremiah van orton crouched before
the likeness of his wife lying nude
upon a chaise-longue he had never seen
her so she had always kept him at arms
length but now she was near-near
enough to touch with the finger tips or
a long pin or a keen-edged knife

  though never for a moment did he
take his mad gaze from the portrait he
did not neglect the task at which he
worked methodically he sharpened on
a whetstone a number of efficient-looking
probes and knives the scrape of the
steel and his panting breath were the only
sounds in the darkened room incessant-
ly he moistened his opened lips with his
tongue his heart pounded in his ears

  jeremiah knew that the excitement of

the execution was killing him that he
must hurry he got to his feet and ad-
dressed the painting in a high cracked
voice

  marion he said i hold your life in
this image by virtue of your skin and
blood do you understand this is
you

  he tried the point of a blue steel probe
against his thumb his voice rose to a
shriek

  you are going to die marion my
love wherever you are

  his bloodshot eyes fixed themselves in
a hypnotic stare as he approached the por-
trait great veins throbbed in his shriv-
eled neck and temples

tsxcellent said mr meyergold

s-j really excellent i must say my
dear bonze you surprize me

  he looked around with an expression
frequently worn by owners of dogs that
are able to sit up or shake hands he as-
sumed an air of patronizing pride he
reasoned that he had played an important
part in the development of this young
artist by his stern and uncompromising
rejection until now of everything he had
done he turned again to the picture and
nodded bonze was a good dog and it
was no more than fair to throw him a
bone-he had earned it excellent he
repeated what do you call it

  i call it said michael racking his
brain for a likely name i call it naked
lady

  mr meyergold glanced up sharply
naked lady he rolled it around on
his tongue good oh very good a
fine distinction this is no ordinary
nude no allegorical grecian goddess to
whom a yard of drapery more or less
makes no difference he thought that
an awfully good line for a review and
decided to make a note of it the instant


weird tales

he left he laughed in appreciation of
his wit oh no this young lady is shy
and embarrassed without her clothing
he went on enlarging the idea in the
hope that he would hit upon another use-
ful line here youve caught a lady in
a most undignified situation i get the
impression that your naked lady is
very much annoyed with us for looking
at her

in her cabin on the beach marion van
orton was changing from her bath-
ing-suit to an elaborate pair of pajamas
suddenly she had a distinct impression
that she was being observed she jerked
a bath-towel up to her chest and swung
around apparently there was nothing
to account for her fear but she knew
that someone was minutely examining
her hurriedly she pulled on her pa-
jamas and ran from the cabin fully ex-
pecting to surprize some rude man in the
act of staring through a chink in the wall
there was no one near

  in spite of the heat of the day she
went back into the cabin and wrapped a
heavy cloak tightly about her still the
miserable feeling persisted

  my goodness she said to herself
i feel positively naked

a month later marion van orton had
 cause to remember that day on the
lido she was sitting in the excelsior
bar reading a new york times two
weeks old she had really been looking
through it to see if there were any more
news of the death of her husband for
a few days the papers had been full of
millionaire husband of actress found
dead when she had first heard of it
she had wondered which of the paintings

it was that had been found slashed to
rags and tatters and she wondered what
had happened before his heart failed that
had made him want to ruin one of the
pictures of which he had always been so
proud

  there was nothing more in the times
the story had been squeezed dry and
dropped in favor of an expedition to the
south pole finishing a rather dull an-
nouncement of the forthcoming exhibit
of paintings by an artist who had just
married his model marion turned to her
handsome companion

  some people insist she said that
more important things happen in new
york than here or anywhere else but
look at this paper there isnt an interest-
ing or important thing in it its all too
too boring for words

  and then quite suddenly that awful
nightmarish feeling returned to her she
was entirely naked and people were look-
ing at her criticizing her appraising her
as she crossed her arms at her throat
here eyes darted about the room search-
ing for the guilty peeping tom she
could detect no one but she knew she
knew that to someone her clothing was
perfectly transparent

  without excusing herself to her star-
tled friend mrs van orton jumped up
and rushed to her room in the hotel she
locked and bolted the door the sensa-
tion was growing stronger every moment
she pulled down the shades and turned
off the light but it was no better she
ran into the clothes closet and shut the
door even there there was no escape
from the certain knowledge that she was
bare and defenseless before a crowd she
drew the hanging dresses tightly around
her and shrank into a corner of the closet
she felt she was going mad

barclay stared closed
his eyes convulsively
then stared again

an eery story of a fiendish murder and a midget psychic investigator-by the
author of invaders from the dark and the devils pool

the taxi drove off leaving funk
on the hoddeston lawn surround-
ed by valises funk was thinking
it more than merely odd that barclay for
whose coaching he had come prepared to
spend a month had not met him as
planned he tried the screen door it
was hooked inside

  hello in there he hailed hopefully

  there was no response the hoddes-

ton farm lay drenched in a torpid leth-
argy for which it was obvious more than
the july heat must be responsible with-
in the house no one stirred on the sur-
rounding fields no one was abroad even
the usual sounds of the farm animals
were hushed

  funk was unpleasantly affected surely
the entire household had not gone to
meet his train and somehow missed it

                                      


weird tales

  he carried his traps to the stoop
crossed the yard to the barnyard and hal-
loed again he knew of old where bar-
clays studio was so he set off down the
path toward the grateful shade of the
woods

  the gray stone walls of the old build-
ing soon glinted through the tree trunks
and heavy foliage a strong conviction
possessed funk that barclay was not
within in fact he found the studio door
padlocked he noted that the west win-
dow was rudely boarded up he walked
around the studio to the north

  here the trees had been cut down and
the studio wall was entirely of glass he
peered in with deepening curiosity but
apart from the usual litter of easels
painting paraphernalia and accessories
canvases in serried rows against the walls
his attention was almost immediately
drawn to a painting propped against the
south wall where the full light from the
opposite windows poured in revealingly

  rum go funk muttered puzzled
that never is barclays work and he
would never have let a student perpetrate
such a monstrosity of line and crude
color

  he pressed his face to the glass cup-
ping it against the outside light

  that old man funk said aloud
amazed may be crudely done but hes
also absolutely horrible his hands-
ugh theyre dead hands bloodless-
waxen-aaarrrgh something about the
way hes sitting there-drooping as if he
hadnt the strength of himself to sit erect
and was being held by something-some-
thing without that you cant see  i
dont like the thing its ugly theres
-something wrong with it

  he said this last with conviction and
as he exclaimed became aware of another
gaze fixed upon himself he snapped
upright and wheeled quickly waiting

patiently for him to finish his examina-
tion of the studios interior stood a man
in patched stained blue overalls

  well snapped funk sharply a bit
taken aback

   mr barclays at the house sor youre
mr funk im mulcahy hoddestons
hired man

  funk nodded all right im com-
ing how did mr barclay come to miss
my train

   we was all down to the police station
sor mulcahy fell in behind him

  police station echoed funk whats
been going on here

  i found mr oakey dead in the studio
this mornin sor

  what funic whirled and confront-
ed the irishman

  theres somethinwrong in there sor
i saw blood on the ould divils beard
the mans voice quavered

  snap out of it mulcahy are you
referring to that-picture

   i am that sor

  blood on the old mans beard ri-
diculous i saw none

  mulcahy insisted stubbornly blood
it was sor an the poor young mans
was all drained out av him sor

  funk stiffened to deep attention ha
this sounds intriguing blood on the
old mans beard

  an drippin from his dead fingers
sor an not wan dhrop left in the
corpse sor blood-all over the dommed
ould divils whiskers an his dead fingers
sor mary mother mulcahy crossed
himself with pious haste

  who did that painting funk de-
manded turning again toward the house

  a mon be the name av silva sor
hes afther bein a cabinet-maker but he
got to thinkin he cud paint so he made
that beauty back there divil fly away wid
him
the sinister painting



  he sure can paint muttered funk
cryptically

  hes mixin somethin wid his paint
that only divils from the pit can give
him the irishman declared darkly he
hesitated then rushed on sor the night
before the poor lad was murthered there
was a fine canvas of mr barclays cut into
ribbons and mr oakeys prize picture
the same what might that mean along
with the poor lads bein killed the next
night an silva only gettin honorable
mention last week where he was lookin
for first prize

  looks as if silva had a motive de-
clared funk as they walked into the barn-
yard

iife was stirring normally about the
j farm now as if a ban of enchanted
silence had been lifted funk could see
barclays bulky body leaning over the va-
lises on the front stoop he hailed his
friend then asked mulcahy hastily
what do the police say

  anny of us might have done it sor
but the studio was locked from the inside
an theres no motive an they cant
figure where the poor lads blood wint
sor back of the simple words pushed
a dark significance of terrible things

  looks as if there were more here than
appears on the surface

  right you are sor from now on
tom mulcahy wears a blessed medal next
his hide day an night

  funk met barclays welcoming hand
with a heartening grip

  sorry to have missed you funk but
this ghastly tragedy has dislocated all
plans i - i was fond of the boy
groaned barclay his face working he
had a gift had harry i-i was looking
forward to what he would do with color

in the not far future and now-

his voice broke

  wheres my room barclay funk
gathered up his bags and followed the
other painter up the front stairs

  both men lighted cigarettes in silence
barclay stared abstractedly from the win-
dow while funk unpacked rapidly puff-
ing clouds of smoke about himself as he
tossed shirts underwear ties into the
open bureau drawers

  i want to know how silvas painting
got into your studio he said at last with
an air of relief as he finished his work

  so you are taking that attitude bar-
clay asked his eyes heavy

  funk did not attempt to evade the im-
plied issue anybody but a crass ma-
terialistic jackass would he responded
quietly

  i didnt know you went in for that
sort of thing ive no time for anything
but painting just making a living takes
most of my time these days funk

  the younger mans eyes snapped a
very little suffices for me im too fas-
cinated with studying the truths underly-
ing the illusions of material existence
not that ive gotten very far but what i
know i know

  then perhaps you can say whats un-
natural about poor harrys death i
know theres-something wrong about
it

  something wrong echoed theyoung-
er man thoughtfully yes theres some-
thing wrong-and uncanny-about this
lads death as to its being unnatural
there are many strange and little-known
laws operating along lines so new to
us- he broke off there his expres-
sion clearing as if an illuminating idea
had suddenly clarified the situation for
him i believe the poor chaps death is
due to an extremely interesting example
of the transference of an evil will-to-
power

  barclay wheeled from the window say-


weird tales

ing abruptly i didnt tell the police
what i felt lay behind this tragedy i
have no hankering to live in an insane
asylum now i have a faint hope that
you may be able to appreciate the strange-
ness of my experience listen

  manuel silva settled here a few years
ago and has been doing well as a cabinet-
maker recently he learned that i got
from three hundred dollars up for a can-
vas fie thought this an easy way to get
rich but i refused to teach him you
know i never take any but advanced stu-
dents of decided promise my refusal
roused silvas furious resentment

  i have instituted an annual art ex-
hibit in town silva entered three can-
vases to force my hand they were
rather terrible one was a blacksmith
dark sullen sinister he was hammering
viciously at what appeared to be a bat-
tered crucifix another was a farmer
slaughtering a wretched hog that some-
how looked like a naked man the butch-
ers face wore a too realistic grin of sad-
istic enjoyment as he wielded his bloody
knife the third - the third was the
painting youve just seen in my studio

  harrys entry took first prize this was
inevitable i felt inclined to encourage
a couple of young local artists so gave
them honorable mention not to slight
silvas pride i included him

  the night before the canvases were
removed harry and i were in the gallery
and he pointed out that someone had de-
liberately cut the honorable mention rib-
bon on silvas canvas so that it hung in
dangling strips odd that eh

  youre opening vistas replied funk
lighting another cigarette from the one
he had been smoking you are absorb-
ingly interesting

  i criticized silvas painting observ-
ing that harry was right when he said it
gave him the jitters but that in just that

degree it possessed a touch of wild genius
harry pronounced it ghastly to paint a
hunched-up old man as dead as a door-
nail his hands frightful decomposing

-	yet sitting up there - ugh silvas
colors were crude his drawing distorted
-just how it would be difficult to say
but-wrong you understand-wrong

  i said i dared not encourage silva be-
cause of a very strange quality in his
work-that something wrong and then
we both nearly jumped out of our skins
for in the dusk behind us someone broke
into an ugly chuckle and we turned to
see a dark figure slouching out it was
silva and i realized that hed heard me
pronounce him an evil genius harry
made light of my compunctions but i was
disturbed

  we confronted the old man in the
painting once more as twilight gained
the room a murky dusk seemed creeping
into the very canvas its shadows deep-
ened the old man merged into his
dark background all but his pallid face
his grayish beard the waxen fingers drop-
ping over his angular knees it was
wrong entirely wrong and then all
at once harry twitched my sleeve and ex-
claimed lets get out of here and we
turned and plunged into the street strick-
en by some subtle panic so obsessing that
it was not until we were back at the hod-
deston farm that we realized how foolish
and unreasonable had been our flight

unk lighted another cigarette

  we went sketching next day bar-
clay went on and hoddeston brought
our canvases back to the studio that
night he told me that silva had sent me
one of his for a gift so harry and i went
down to see which one we lighted
candles and really we got a nasty shock
the flickering inadequate candle-light
made that old man appear more than ever
the sinister painting



an entity with a horrid existence inde-
pendent of his painted presentment
harry said my god in a kind of comic
dismay

   i knew instinctively that silva was up
to no good he bore me malice his very
gift seemed to convey dire menace in
the pale candle-light the old mans beard
appeared to rustle stiffly as if his lips were
parting under its bushy shelter of
course i could not see anything but i
felt that i was seeing a pale dead tongue
flick moisture over dry dead lips ugh

  that must have been an odd sensa-
tion cogitated funk aloud as he ex-
pelled a thick cloud of smoke you
make it very clear

  yes well theres more of it funk
oakey and i went over our canvases to
check on their return and good condition
we were satisfied just remember this
point will you we padlocked the stu-
dio door and went off to bed when we
went in next morning the padlock was
undisturbed and all the windows locked
on the inside

  but one of my best canvases had been
slit into ribbons and harrys which
had taken first prize was completely de-
molished even the frame that last act
of vandalism made me feel bad id been
sure the boy could cash in on his work
and he needed the money he took it like
a spartan but he told me he was going to
sleep in the studio that night for he felt
sure that silva had done the damage

  i agreed although i couldnt figure
out how silva could have gotten inside
so last night i left the boy there he
said he was going to hang something over
the old mans gosh-awful face i offered
to stay with him but he wouldnt have it

this morning- barclay broke down

turning back to the window with a suspi-
cious gulp

  mulcahy told me funk hastened to
say lighting another cigarette

  it was ghastly funk mulcahy was
howling blood at every jump he took
blood he yelled on the old mans beard
hm how about the coroner
harryd been dead for hours fin-
ger marks on his throat every drop of
blood drained from his body barclay
said with slow emphasis mulcahy had
seen him through the north windows i
had to break the west window to get in
the coroner said at first that hed had a
fit but finally decided hed been killed by
a person unknown

  about the blood queried funk
mulcahy was right about it funk-
i saw it too

  its not there now funk declared
barclay nodded thats another
strange thing when i rushed over i
found poor harry sprawling on the floor
his body all twisted in a grotesque grue-
some position and so terribly white
as i threw myself on the floor beside
him something struck upon my inner ear
it was a sound but such a sound even
as i heard it i knew i was hearing what
could not be apprehended physically

  i sprang to my feet and confronted
silvas hideous canvas god it was hor-
rible he shuddered at the bare recol-
lection the painted old man sat there
motionless but it was a sinister restraint
funk i stared stricken by a horror that
affected me with nausea for i saw then
that someone had smeared that ancients
deathly pallor with crimson that crawled
down the painted gray beard the dead
hands that hung over the angular knees
were dripping every pallid finger-tip
with blood blood funk

  how do you know it was blood
funk demanded sharply

  i-i touched it whispered the old
man distastefully


weird tales

  and then funk prompted not un-
gently

  a ghastly thing came to pass i did
not see it i felt rather than saw i be-
came aware with that inner sense of the
movement of one of the old mans paint-
ed arms it lifted with the jerking un-
evenness of an automaton and passed
across the stained gray beard i say it
moved i felt it move yet at the same
time i was aware that it was only painted
hence incapable of movement it was a
something else behind it that actually
moved

   i find it almost impossible to clarify
my intuitions barclay deprecated de-
spairingly other than to say that while
the painted figure did not stir i was yet
inwardly aware that it lifted one arm and
wiped away the crimson from its beard
then it reached out on either side to
drag off that horrible drip from its waxen
finger-tips against the painted grass that
reddened under them

  god it was the more horrible be-
cause although the figure did not show
movement to my straining eyes yet i saw
the crimson life-blood of poor harry dis-
appearing from the canvas as those move-
ments which i felt rather than saw took
place of course this explanation is in-
adequate he finished

funk pushed the consumed tip of his
cigarette to the fresh one he was hold-
ing between his thin lips a cloud of
blue smoke enveloped him out of which
his voice pronounced decidedly not
inadequate my dear fellow on the con-
trary it is very enlightening so clear that
i believe we may yet punish the murderer
of that poor lad

  barclays dreamy eyes burned with sud-
den fire id give a year of my life to
accomplish that he exclaimed fiercely

  i hardly think so much will be re-

quired but you may have to sacrifice one
or two of your canvases wed better get
the rest of oakeys work over here and
silva must learn that you are taking steps
to protect harrys work and your own
he must be informed that tomorrow
night you yourself will sleep in the stu-
dio that will bring him funk pre-
dicted darkly

  you agree that its silva cried bar-
clay in relief

  ive no doubt of it but not in pro-
pria persona hes projecting his astral
body through that hideous old man and
hes already made a grave error

  what do you mean

  hes permitted himself to savor hu-
man blood hence he can not be per-
mitted to - continue hes dangerous
now he will be yet more so unless
checked i propose to do this in the only
permanent way possible

  we have no proof of his presence in
the studio funk who would believe
the intangible evidence of my experi-
ence

  no one ordinarily funk agreed
adding quickly but i believe and
there is another person who will not only
believe but will furnish me with the
means of putting a stop to silvas mur-
derous proclivities without disturbing the
authorities unduly he finished dryly

   wouldnt it be wise to return that pic-
ture to silva or cut it to bits and burn
it suggested barclay uneasily

  later said funk queerly you
see silva has somehow learned how to
transfer his will-for-evil to that creature
of his own making it is through that
same creation that we must reach him and
stop his criminal career before it is too
late

  barclay sighed you speak as if you
knew what you were talking about funk
i cant just understand you but i feel
the sinister painting



that you are somehow right what do
you wish done

  get mulcahy - or hoddeston - to
clear out all oakeys canvases leave only
a couple of your own that you dont par-
ticularly care about so as not to stir
silvas suspicions overly hell imagine
youre exhibiting then have hoddeston
step in and tell silva what happened to
the canvases in the studio and ask him to
have his moved out of harms way that
will appear a kindly impulse on your part
and he will reply that hell send for his
canvas in a couple of days hell figure
on polishing you off by then finished
funk callously

  agreeable thought that sighed the
older painter

  now youre going to lend me your
roadster ill be back tomorrow afterj
noon at the latest be sure silva is given
to understand that tomorrow night youll
be sleeping in the studio under no cir-
cumstances however venture in there
tonight funk warned gravely to-
night silva or whatever wakens in the
studio under the stimulus of his evil pur-
pose may have free play but tomorrow
night-ah tomorrow night i shall be
there not you

  i wont permit your getting into a
nasty situation funk this isnt your
affair after all harry was my protege
its up to me

   are you prepared to give effective bat-
tle to a painted demon barclay funks
laugh was incredulous can you
through that painted thing silence for
ever the intangible distant malefactor
you can do such things said bar-
clays hushed murmur

  i shall know how to before i return
tomorrow afternoon

  but how

  im going to someone who knows i
shall demand the secret she will yield

it i am certain im going to see gwen
carradorne

  where have i heard that name puz-
zled barclay

  possibly in connection with her pub-
lished brochures her reality of the ab-
stract is fairly well known its discussed
everywhere

  quite likely sighed barclay i
seem to remember it vaguely

  now pursued funk briskly how
about your car

it was dusk when funk returned on the
following day the seriousness and
abstraction that wove a cloak about him
struck barclays curious inquiries into si-
lence a certain high air about the
younger artist forbade imperiously any
break upon that lofty mood funks first
query was had silva been duly informed
of the occupation of the studio that night

  he knows he told hoddeston that
he would call for his unappreciated mas-
terpiece in a couple of days the words
were significantly emphasized

  i rather fancied hed say that he
knows youll be there tonight

  hoddeston told him if there were
any further trouble id sleep there from
tonight on to protect his painting
excellent funk rubbed his hands
together and blew a cloud of thick smoke
from the cigarette in one corner of his
mouth and was there any

  yes last night the two canvases id
left were demolished

  good hell be expecting you to
sleep there tonight lets have supper
then ill run into town and fetch miss
carradorne she insists upon coming
out the time was too brief to prepare me
to handle the situation single-handed
thats extraordinarily kind of her
funk but if she is to be at the studio
tonight why not i barclay insisted


weird tales

  she would have handled it alone only

that she- funk broke off suddenly

looking apologetic sorry i cant be
more explicit but she bans discussion of
herself unless she decides to come out
into the open which she rarely does
shes-well wait until you meet her if
she permits it funk broke off in a kind
of embarrassment youll understand
then but believe me she is worthy the
highest respect and admiration a human
being could expect

funk did not have to drive to town
between dusk and dark a shining dark
blue car with a special delivery body
slipped into the driveway from the
limousine-like front two uniformed men
alighted and walked to the rear of the
car there were wide doors there which
they proceeded to open they withdrew
with the utmost care a strange anachron-
ism a blue-and-black-and-gold decorated
sedan chair small and delicate they
placed themselves between the shafts and
started toward the farmhouse

  funk exclaimed and sprang down the
steps to meet that odd equippage he
bent over what was obviously an extended
hand white in the dusk barclay star-
ing saw the young artist touch his lips
to those extended fingers a childs
high shrilly sweet voice gave an order
and the chair-bearers carried the sedan
chair toward the barnyard funk fol-
lowed calling back as he went

  see you tomorrow morning barclay
with that he disappeared after the chair
into the soft darkness beyond the barn-
yard

  barclay felt that he could not sleep
he was intensely irritated that gwen car-
radorne should have sent a child to take
her place in what he felt must be a post
of danger he went down to the shining
automobile and walked around it with

curiosity the rear doors had been
closed and nothing marked it as out of
the ordinary save perhaps the expensive
type of shock-absorbers for a delivery
body and of course what looked very
like a periscope set in the top as much
out of place as was a modern child in a
sedan chair

  he sat at his window fell asleep there
in his chair and did not waken until mrs
hoddeston tapped at his door calling
that mr funk and the little girl had re-
turned she volunteered that the little
girl was a perfect little french doll

  barclay took the stairs three at a stride
in the hall funk sat on a hassock which
brought his face slightly below the level
of the small oval countenance of the
child who sat sedately on the hall chair

  barclay noted with an artists apprecia-
tion the bloom on her dazzling cheeks
the straight nose the richly scarlet mobile
lips he approved the curling black
lashes finely penciled arching eyebrows
sleek black bobbed hair her creamy
silk dress rather longer than worn by
most children of her age apparently
about six was smocked in a knowing
fashion with bright colors her feet
were inappropriately encased in high-
heeled french slippers

  all this the artist in barclay captured
at a glance just as he took in the beauty
of the slender tiny hands of the taper
fingers and the eloquence of every ges-
ture a strange an unusual child this
his leaping footsteps brought upon him a
lifting of fringed eyelids and what he
felt shrinkingly was a glance of indiffer-
ence he stopped short at the foot of
the staircase abashed at this disdainful
glance

  he knew all at once why this childs
frock was longer than customary why
her tiny feet wore adult-styled foot-gear
why sophistication animated those taper
the sinister painting



fingers the cobalt blue eyes that regard-
ed him from the childs elfin face were
the eyes of a grown woman they were
the informed eyes of one who has passed
through the fires of varied experiences
the eyes of one who has gazed unafraid
upon unveiled mysteries the child was
not a child but was an exquisite midget
a creature set apart from the entire world
by her miniature proportions

  funk sprang up caught the other
mans hand and drew him down to the
hassock himself sinking upon the floor
so that both mens faces were below the
level of the midgets

  barclay funk said in a tone of re-
pressed excitement miss carradorne
permits me to present you

  honored miss carradorne mumbled
barclay still confused under the keen
gaze of those faintly derisive blue eyes
he understood it after a minute she was
touched with amusement at his discomfi-
ture

  an elfish smile twitched at one corner
of her scarlet lips and she actually turned
away those too-shrewd eyes as if to spare
barclays feelings a kindly gesture which
did not serve to tranquillize him for
there was just a touch of condescension in
her half-smile

  mr funk has been showing me these
canvases from your studio she said
slowly in a shrilly sweet voice i would
very much like that snow scene it is
charming if you will tell me the
price-

  barclays embarrassment vanished
here he could be sure of himself

  i would feel honored if you would
accept it as a proof of my gratitude for
your having come here he began but
his eyes questioned funk

  you are anxious to learn the outcome
of last nights plans said miss carra-
dornes high voice lightly

  suspended in the bosom of her frock
by a slender platinum chain was a plat-
inum whistle which she put to her lips
and sounded at once the bearers of the
sedan chair came up the steps and into
the hall holding the chair close to their
mistress like some bright bird so airy
and graceful was her lithe movement she
seemed to fly from her chair into the
sedans shelter she waved one tiny
hand the bearers took their light bur-
den outside slid it into place in the rear
of the waiting automobile they mount-
ed into the front and the car slipped
noiselessly away down the road bespeak-
ing the many-cylindered motor by its very
silence and power

barclay stared after it amazed so
that strange little thing is your won-
derful gwen carradorne why didnt
you warn me

  funk lighted a cigarette hastily and be-
gan surrounding himself with smoke
why didnt i because she wont be
talked about shes proud and sensitive
she considers her miniature body the ul-
timate of human perfection and wont
permit its comparison with what she con-
siders our gross bodies and shes ab-
normally proud of her brain she has
reason to be i think it is the most high-
ly developed i have ever known as an
occultist-shes the seventh daughter of a

seventh daughter-

  funk broke off bruskly you are an-
xious to know about last night she has
forbidden me to divulge details but i
may tell you briefly that silva will never
again repeat his evil act

  he was there then last night
gasped barclay incredulously

  not in propria persona but his famil-
iar was already locked in with us when i
bolted the door behind gwen and my-
self


weird tales

  what do you mean

  funk sighed resignedly lets go
down to the studio its easier to under-
stand when youve seen things with your
own eyes

  the telephone rang mrs hoddeston
ran out of the kitchen and answered it
an expression of horror settled on her
placid face

  manuel silvas been found dead with
a knife-wound in his throat she called
and gave closer attention to the tel-
ephone

  funk beckoned barclay silently and
the two hurried across the barnyard and
into the woods with the key barclay
had loaned him funk unlocked the pad-
lock he pushed the studio door open
words seemed superfluous

  spread on the floor lay a painted can-
vas figure pinned down by a knife
through its throat the edges of the can-
vas were sharply defined as if just cut out

of the painting leaning against the south
wall with a neatly trimmed vacancy in its
center

  barclay stared closed his eyes convul-
sively then stared again

  i couldnt have done it alone funk
kept repeating in a kind of feverish ex-
citement she furnished the power
shed have done it herself but shes too
-i mean he corrected himself hastily
he was too tall

  barclay stared motionless he was
absorbing the details of a bizarre thing
which confirmed him in his hasty resolu-
tion to burn silvas painting without de-
lay

  the empty space in the painting dis-
tinctly outlined a drooping seated figure
the painted canvas shape lying on the
floor pinned down by the knife through
its pallid painted throat could have
filled that vacancy twice over

   it vas a full length standing figure

ine terror

by howard wandrei

an unusual weird-scientific tale about vegetable vampires that lusted for

                    animal and human food

roman sholla stood perfectly
still on his front sidewalk bewil-
 dered he blinked a few times
and opened and closed his mouth like a
fish out of water then he thrust his
still unlighted pipe into his pocket and
ran

there was reason enough for his
fright sholla proprietor of souths cut-

rate supplies lived on the outskirts of
the community below the hill on which
stood the glass stone and metal faced
south experimental laboratories

  it was about twenty minutes past seven
when sholla issued from his front door
in his hand a pipe which he loaded
methodically with a poking forefinger
he proceeded down his front walk at

                                     


weird tales

which point he produced a match from
his side pocket and struck it on the mail-
box nailed to the oak tree but the tree
wasnt there it had moved moved out
of reach the earth was shouldered aside
at the base of the huge broken-barked
bole was what seemed to be a wake of
turf

  fo foteen years he explained ex-
citedly to eric shane who lived across the
street i strike m match on the tree
you see me do it what is happen he
looked around belligerently at the little
group that had collected and which had
drifted back to the scene of the novelty

   tell you what i come down the
walk and put out my hand to the post-
box to strike the match every morning
just the same eric will tell you so but
now i cant reach it he said his voice
trembling look for yourself the
tree has move away from the sidewalk
he pointed passionately at the base of the
tree with his unlighted pipe before it
between the little huddle of men and the
tree was a plowed furrow like a short
fresh grave

  wiry dark little fred yanotsky who
had once inspected ore at the ashton
mills was looking up at the laboratories
on the hill above shollas house

  you vill find vhy up dere i tink
he said malignantly no good come of
machines i know i work wit ma-
chines for ten twelve year many funny
tings happen funny tings his voice
trailed off ominously

  ah exclaimed sholla contemptuous-
ly you talk like crazy because you catch
yourself in the wheels one time whose
fault was it you want to hang the big
stamp maybe or the digger praps you
like to burn those generator up there
like witches in the old country

  i do know said yanotsky slowly
shaking his head i see some awful

funny tings he looked up balefully at
the power plant and fingered the mutila-
tions of the arm that had been caught in
the mill machinery many years ago

  ay spoke up an old bearded fellow
papa freng what has happened to the
game tell me roman sholla

  the game said sholla how do
you mean

  the game the small game what
has happened to all the rabbits where
are the squirrels that used to come to my
window for nuts all summer and all win-
ter i tell you there has been no small
game seen here these three months nor
the small green snakes even roman
sholla what of the birds

  birds what are you talking about
papa up there is a bird now he
pointed off at a slow-winged turkey buz-
zard of remarkable size a really gigantic
specimen that was pursuing a low undu-
lating flight toward the wood that sur-
rounded the hill and the laboratories
the five men at the oak tree turned and
eyed the bird warily as though they were
watching judgment approach the buz-
zard passed nearly overhead somewhat to
the right of shollas house and side-
winged into a wide spiral as it prepared
to alight in the trees half-way between
the house and the laboratories on the hill
its trailing legs dropped a trifle the
wings spread umbrella-wise and momen-
tarily it disappeared from view among
the foliage sholla turned to papa freng
triumphantly saying

  well papa there was one-or didnt
i see it

  look said the old man seizing his
arm and shaking it

  the buzzard had suddenly reappeared
beating its wings so violently that to the
five astonished men it sounded like a
waterfall the frantic bird uttered
hoarse terrified cries thrashing the air

                    w t-
vine terror



heavily it was apparently working to
lift some tremendous weight the cries
ceased abruptly as the bird seemed to
erupt above the foliage it was heavily
laden with what could only be a vine
which was entangled in its claws and
dangled with many lively twists drop-
ping earth from the curling whipping
roots as the bird circled wearily higher
and higher above the woods-higher and
higher till the silent gaping circle of
watchers strained their eyes to see and
then when the great black buzzard like
a living kite with its grotesque tail was
almost beyond vision above them the
vine dropped away it fell as though
weighted roots first behind its down-
ward plunge trailed a little flurry of
leaves that had been torn away the vine
plummeted into the trees with a distant
leafy uproar in almost precisely the same
spot from which it had issued and
when the five gaping watchers looked
again into the sky the great buzzard was
nowhere to be seen

from the central chamber of the lab-
oratories a watcher commanded at
least a fifteen-mile view across the plains
this morning a tall gray man was stand-
ing at the windows looking out thought-
fully with keen blue eyes from where
he stood he could just make out the group
of men now straggling away from the
front of shollas house he was smiling
tolerantly

   what cheer fellow citizen said a
voice behind him

  oh hello schommer said haver-
land turning around why its those
confounded birds again they dont
seem to like these woods at all i cant
imagine what the devil has got into em
well have to beat them up one of these
days and see whether theres a hungry
critter or two down there set traps

    w t-

  yes said schommer blinking away
the dregs of sleep why i havent seen
even a squirrel around here since-well
since poor keene got his

  that was three months ago haver-
land remembered it with regret and a
great deal of embarrassment to his
complete shame whatever it was that
keene the senior engineer had been
working on-and those projects of his
were remote enough-haverland had
destroyed when keene had been elec-
trocuted haverland and the newcomer
harriss had been assisting in his experi-
ment schommer stood just back of
keene there was one peculiar aspect of
the affair that haverland thought of af-
terward as a remarkable if peculiar
conception of his own at any rate it
seemed to have been a phenomenon wit-
nessed only by himself

  keene had stretched forth a lean hand
and the bare wire had crossed his wrist
and then there was light like a halo

  from where haverland stood watch-
ing through the poles of two huge elec-
trodes between which was fixed a bulb
of one of the inert gases keenes body
seemed to be aflame he stood there like
a waxwork moments after haverland had
disconnected the current phosphores-
cent fires chased up and down his arms
and the exposed flesh of his breast and
face seemed to be burning the soft ra-
diance brightened gradually harriss and
schommer apparently blind to this auro-
ra of light gaped at their chief fearfully
the radiation of light was now sharply
brilliant and as haverland gasped at its
brightness there was a violent explosion
of radiant energy from keenes head that
shocked him into temporary blindness

  it was a stupid an unforgivable thing
to do it irritated haverland to think he
could be capable of such carelessness
that bulb of gas in which had appeared


weird tales

a deposit of transparent flowing crystals
might have had some important bearing
on the nature of keenes mystical and
complex experiments one almost dared
suppose that the impossible was some-
times possible and that perhaps in this
one case the inert gas or combination of
inert gases that keene had been work-
ing on was active after all

  still who would know the subtle ways
of agnes the laboratory cat it was all
chance that it was high noon when
keene died that the hungry cat was
mewing on the central table and that
when haverland set the mysterious bulb
with its more mysterious contents on the
table the affectionate agnes pawed it
caused it to roll into the sink compart-
ment and shatter all chance and yet
haverland could only blame himself for
a fools negligence

  but that radiation of light from
keenes dying body was something to be
considered in haverlands own idiom it
was one for the books halo the leg-
endary gods of greece and rome robed
in light the death light the ancient
gods of india the primitive deities of all
countries even unto christ and the chris-
tian saints all enhaloed tradition some-
where originates in truth and in the time-
forgotten genesis of that shining legend
the legend of the halo was the simple
function of a physical law a mystery once
visible haverland shook his head
there were more fools with their fol-
lies   

  as he entered his own private labora-
tory leaving schommer to luxurious
yawns he thought again of that curious
inexplicable deposit of crystals in the bulb
of stable gas-crystals that seemed to be
composed of microcosmic glass beads by
the billion and that surely had an in-
volved slow endless motion of their
own haverland felt that he was peering

into the unknown and again and again
the sensation of his personal connection
with the death of keene filled him with
uneasiness and with shame as though he
had committed some vast error

  he noted something unusual in the
condition of his room and stopped short
at the end of the laboratory table the
window had been broken possibly by a
vine which passed through the opening
the vine twisted along the table top and
was entangled in haverlands microscope
a pile of glass slides was knocked down
several had fallen to the floor and shat-
tered

  haverland toed the fragments irri-
tably a great deal of damage had been
done he started to untangle the vine
from the microscope and crowd it back
through the window swearing mildly to
himself then dropped it and pulled ab-
sently at his lower lip perplexed it
struck him suddenly as being very very
odd that a clumsy meandering growth
like this tortuous creeper should have
worked so much of itself into the room

   some four or five days later haverland
experienced a moment of pure fright
the window had been repaired but was
now open haverland sat on the sill
looking over rolling country that was
farmed by the hunkies of south he
could see a fan of men spreading through
a distant plowed field for what he didnt
know as he watched he was aware of
something crawling along his bare fore-
arm a small beetle a fly he brushed
it off then froze in position panic-strick-
en the beetle was not a beetle at all
but a tendril of the vine that grew out-
side the window in one eternal minute
he took account of many things of the
fact that the vine which had never been
any more remarkable than any of its kind
was now unimaginably luxuriant hang-
ing from the side of the building in a
vine terror



vast cloud of leaves of the fact that a
pungent unpleasant odor moved about
and among this cloud and that a small
tendril of this inexplicable new growth
was visibly insinuating its way along his
forearm

haverland had watched the slow un-
folding of the cereus but this thing
crept along like a wooden worm vested
in leaves it was encircling his arm de-
liberately the delicate shoots seemed to
be freckled with infinitesimal suckers
and wherever they touched they clung
haverland plucked at the thing and it
resisted suddenly it seemed to grow
into his flesh with the shock of pain
the engineer snatched it violently from
his arm and flung it out the thing had
been sucking his blood

  vegetable vampires

  all along his arm were tiny red beads
like a perspiration of blood as though he
had been pricked with a thousand needles
all at once at this moment there was
an impatient rapping at the door it was
schommer

  grave-robbers he said shortly and
with an expression on his face that hav-
erland was not to forget

  what he said astonished

  schommers blue eyes glared

  theyve dug him up he said furi-
ously to which he added meeting
haverlands blank look keene

  keene had been buried at the bottom
of the hill according to his own often-
expressed wish schommer and haver-
land hastening toward the small cleared
plot that contained his grave could see
nothing until they reached the place be-
cause of the foliage-banked iron grille-
work around it then haverland stopped
dead dismayed while schommer watched
him grimly almost accusingly thought
haverland the grave was torn up

plowed up a few bars of the grille
were bent and impaled on the spears of
these bars was keenes body it had ap-
parently been so displaced for some time
vines having partially enwrapped it and
broken into the flesh

  when did you discover it asked
haverland appalled

  only this morning my wife reminds
me to put flowers on the grave once a
week schommer pointed to a scattered
bunch of flowers on the ground-fresh
flowers and the dried stalks of the past
now who would do this thing he
said bitterly looking at haverland then
he was silent

  afterward though the whole horror
of it seemed to be crystallized in some-
thing almost irrelevant when the body
was removed to the cemetery in town it
had first to be disengaged from those
horrible vines the trained eyes of hav-
erland and schommer were alone in see-
ing that the flesh in nearest conjunction
with the vines presented a most remark-
able appearance it looked raw haver-
land thought of the word digested
schommer was staring at him and hav-
erland looked at schommer while the
disgusted deputies of souths coroner
quickly practised their trade

  the potentialities of the vine vines
that climb and vines that hang creep-
ers that find their ways upward to the
sun tough vines that bind vines that
clutch and choke that gripe the best life
out of the vegetation that gives them
foothold the gleaming wholly denud-
ed skeleton of a squirrel still intact
entangled in the vine that girdled the
body of keene

  keenes death seemed in some way to
have laid a curse over the woods and the
small game that inhabited them the
three months afterward were a chronicle
of desertion the small cries of birds and


weird tales

the chuckling calls of wild things decreas-
ing in number day by day till there were
only long silences broken by sounds that
could not be identified the quick fly-
ing skip of a rabbit was as rare now as
the cadenced flight of the jay and the
gull the pleasant frightened movement
of wild things disturbed and the splash
of leaves had given place to queer long
meaningless rustles rustles that marked
the insinuating course of large snakes or
perhaps the rustles of heavy vines that
overweighted were dropping by degrees
from their places among the oaks the
birches and the cottonwoods contin-
uous movements unseen the threat of
invisibles

except when some problem kept him
in the building overnight haverland
habitually rode into the city with schom-
mer and both men were thankful for
schommers car it was a good three-
quarters of a mile from the laboratories
into south and the dense woods denser
now with this monstrous new growth of
underbrush overhung the road all the
way a lonely walk at night

  not even an owl said schommer
used to be a lot of them

  he was driving slowly and now
stopped the car to listen not a sound of
bird or beast he looked at haverland
who had his lean gray head cocked for-
ward listening intently

   this place is like a cellar schommer
continued in his peculiar clipped style of
speech nothing moving not a sound
even a beastly smell

   his broad lips curled with displeasure
as he released the brake and the car began
to move

  wait said haverland gripping his
arm

  schommer looked at him inquiringly
then thrust his head farther out of the

window to listen also there was never
a sound the woods were deathly still

  hear something he asked skepti-
cally only living thing ive seen around
here in three months was our friend the
buzzard this morning c a septentvion-
alis and for such a big one even he didnt
stay long

  listen said the sharp-eared haver-
land and with so commanding a voice
that schommer obeyed opening the door
and stepping outside the car

  at once there was an explosion of
sound in the woods near by the air
was filled with outburst after outburst of
agonized cries cries  that seemed to be
neither brute nor human

  schommer snatched a flashlight from
the pocket of the car and plunged
through the brush at the side of the road
haverland following they had scarcely
entered the woods the beam of light
playing through the leaves ahead of them
when the uproar terminated in a cutting
scream they advanced through the
woods hastily still hearing an unaccount-
able wild thrashing sound close at hand

  when they found the origin of the dis-
turbance not fifty feet within the woods
they stopped gasping with horror all
about them were trees hung with vines
directly in front of them was a large
specimen at the foot of a huge cotton-
wood in movement it was thrashing
about like a whip the end of it was
wound tightly about some object which
as they watched it thrown bloodily against
the trunks of the cottonwood and the sur-
rounding trees they saw was a dog

  schommer ran forward for a closer
view

  stop you fool shouted haverland
instinctively and at that moment a creep-
er on the ground entangled itself in
schommers leg and tripped him head-
long he tried to get up and found him-
vine terror



self tied hand and foot tender young
vines enwound his wrists and ankles like
steel wires he wrestled with them grunt-
ing with pain

  cannibalism kind eating kind hav-
erland stood there nerveless and felt
sickeningly that he was looking again
into the unknown when schommer
fell the light had been thrown from his
hand and now shone directly on the base
of the cottonwood the vine moved
slightly like a tentacle as though the dog
somewhere off in the darkness were still
struggling to free itself slowly schom-
mer was still trying to raise himself from
the ground the great veins of his neck
and forehead standing out darkly in the
oblique light of the flash

  im caught he said helplessly and
then cried out with terror as a creeper cut
into one fleshy wrist and made a bracelet
of spouting blood

  help help me he screamed at
which haverland nervously aware of
black black shadows banked on shadows
blacker still among the depths of the tall
trees stumbled blindly forward produced
a knife from his pocket and flicked it
open the vine holding the dog was
perfectly still then and schommer sud-
denly managed to free himself upon
which having brushed off his clothes he
proceeded to bind up his wrist with a
handkerchief then feeling highly re-
sentful and perhaps a little foolish be-
cause of the wholly deserted character of
the still woods he picked up the flash-
light and directed it toward the ground
at his feet

  well thats funny he said taking
up the vine that had tripped him and
dropping it again did you ever see
any wood like that

  the vine was limp flabby and draped
along the ground like a leafy rope

schommer stepped on it and grimaced as
it gave under his heel like flesh

  ugh he exclaimed what the
devil do you suppose it is never saw
anything like it

  haverland examined the root of the
vine and was about to draw his knife
through it but there was a windless
rustle in the trees and the vine which
had been lying as loose as a newly dead
snake and as cold was now rigid and
hard in his hand he caught the fleeting
impression that he was the object of eery
unearthly attention he felt that he was
threatened the woods were now com-
pletely still watching waiting the silence
was a tangible menace suffocating him
moving against him

  shall we take it along asked schom-
mer might have to get a spade un-
less-

  he stooped over and gripped the vine
at its base now quite limp and tried to
pull it out by the roots haverland held
the light schommer was generously
built and his contorted face showed tre-
mendous exertion but the vine wouldnt
give an inch as he straightened up
nursing his wrist and swearing softly
haverland saw the root of the creeper
withdraw fractionally into the ground
for all the world like an earthworm

  hm-m said schommer clearing his
throat queer vine that how about
the other one

  lets go see said haverland and
walked carefully through the dark litter
of brush toward the big cottonwood
holding the light before him

  the vine that had trapped the dog was
a large climber closely involved in its
foliage was the dead mangled animal
which he stooped to examine schom-
mer grasped the main stem of the plant
and shook it experimentally it seemed to
have the character of any other vine but


weird tales

when he turned aside to toe the battered
bloody ruin of the dog the vine wobbled
drunkenly

  compact gnarled arms of fiber that
thought intricately contrived sap-carry-
ing tubes sap that pulsed sap that beat
through wooden arms arms that looked
about for supporting trees and moved de-
liberately like the tentacles of a land
octopus haverland shivered with the
thought he received the uncomfortable
impression that he had entered a stran-
gers house by some freak or had the
dubious privilege of wandering through
the devils own garden of being tolerated
in that journey

  lets get out of this schommer said
haverland we can look this thing
over in the daytime he tried to make
his voice sound casual but the words
came out harsh and knotty

  schommer joined him and as the two
picked their way back to the car he said
what the devil do you suppose hap-
pened to that dog

  looked like some cats work haver-
land lied probably the beast thats been
accounting for all the game thats disap-
peared got away before either of us
saw him

  schommer shook his massive leonine
head no cat in the country was big
enough to kill a dog so horribly why
the thing he had touched with his foot
was no more than shreds a red puddle
of flesh and splintered bones no it was
a stronger more savage beast than a cat
a beast so thorough and so subtle in its
destruction that it absorbed living things
into itself without its existence being sus-
pected

alight breeze moved through the
woods as the two engineers ap-
proached the car a moist muggy breeze
and the grove of cottonwoods below the

laboratory was filled with sound the
majestic trees were scarcely distinguish-
able against the black sky but fireflies
illuminated the foliage here and there
and briefly showed vast and looming
walls of leaves and branches in whose
enclosure the two men at the car seemed
to be at the bottom of a well of shadows
the effect was that of a great beast lying
prone and still which had suddenly com-
menced to breathe there was no fresh-
ness in the air rather the effluvia pouring
out of a boundless swamp the sensitive
haverland harkened to the sound of the
night breeze through the leaves and
noted the peculiar leatheriness of their
motion and collision with each other the
familiar fresh sound of the wind playing
through poplars and cottonwoods had
taken on the character of a confident ju-
bilant multitudinous handclapping

  he remembered that sound later
among the realities of his home in the
city those engulfing shadows flocked
about him and marched endlessly through
his dreams through dreams of leafy cord-
ings and living ropes dreams of phos-
phorescent foliage and vines enhaloed all
sounding before the violence of cyclonic
winds that blew the radiance into flame

  hurried harried by dreads and he
knew not what next day he busied him-
self with an apparatus which he had set
up in his rooms a day or two before this
consisted chiefly of a microscope and a
common broad beaker in the beaker
and filling it to the brim was a pulpy
mass in which could be discerned indis-
putable chlorophyl leaves ground into a
kind of rough paste macerated vines with
their foliage which he had clipped from
the creeper outside the window the
writhing the leaping and the voiceless
fury near the microscope was a del-
icate graduated instrument used for some
kind of measurement alongside the
vine terror



microscope stood a small glass-stoppered
bottle nearly full of a transparent umber
fluid which had been expressed from the
pulp

  still doubtful hesitating never con-
vinced haverland delayed his investiga-
tion one moment more he approached
a locker and removed from it a soggy
paper package with as much delibera-
tion as he could muster he opened it and
produced a large piece of raw meat he
walked to the window with it opened
the window and then lingering still
stepped back wind outside plucked at
the tower of vines and its whole length
undulated with a confusion of whispers

  haverland wiped his brow sagging
with perspiration and flung the meat
outside the vine thrashed out across the
window in a moment the meat had
been torn into minute shreds and the
whole disappeared among the foliage
haverland slammed the window and
leaned against it when the leaves pat-
ted the glass against his back he sobbed
pound after pound of fresh raw meat
vanishing thus in midair below the win-
dow if he desired to look was a sprin-
kling of clean-picked bones even to the
skeleton of a bird or two there re-
mained one certain test which the engi-
neer felt was final

  as he stood before the odd collection
of objects on the laboratory table silent
and thoughtful he was aware of remark-
able hootings and whisperings outside the
building it was as though the wind
finding small apertures and irregularities
in the construction of the place were de-
riding him and his work making sport
of his loneliness

  the day had been overcast the light
breeze that had begun the day before had
blown up banks of clouds all day long
till by late afternoon the sky was obscured
with a thick uninterrupted blanket the

color of dusty metal that seemed to serve
as a sounding-board for dull thunders in
the distance

schommer since he lived near by and
wanted to finish up the business of
the night before had called for his chief
in the morning early as they were when
they had passed through south and en-
tered the road leading through the woods
below the south laboratories they found
their way blocked by a man at work

  eric shane who lived at the far end of
south was one of the more capable labor-
ers among the community of foreigners
because of his war record when such
things were of importance in employ-
ment he held the position of road patrol-
man along the network leading out of
south his grader built after the fash-
ion of the war-time tanks with which he
was familiar was stalled in the middle
of the road he was proceeding on foot
along the ditch at one side industriously
wielding a scythe at the sound of
schommers brakes he turned about

  after observing the two in the car
silently for a moment he said deliber-
ately

  wery juicy

  whats that eric asked schommer
the wines wet juicy shane re-
peated he held out his scythe from
which yellow sap was dripping

  vines well said schommer puz-
zled whatre you cutting em for

  big fellahs said shane shaking his
head across the road blowing around
from the wind lots easier to cut

  i dont see any said schommer
craning his neck to look beyond the grad-
er cut the rest of them already
shane looked steadily up the road then
stared owlishly at the two engineers as
though he had seen them for the first
time


weird tales

  maybe maybe not he said i aint
been vorking wery long i tink maybe
vind blow him back

  he picked up the creeper he had just
slashed and threw it hastily into the
woods delivering a kick at one heavy
dragging end of it then he wiped his
sap-stained hands on his coveralls and
looked at schommer shyly

  should i move him he asked point-
ing to the grader

  later said schommer weve got
a little job for you in the woods bring
along your spade

  eric unhooked the spade from the
grader and looked at it perplexed as he
followed schommer and haverland
through the brush in a moment the
three men arrived at a spot where the
ground was broadly disturbed

  this is it said schommer

  minus the dog said haverland
staring at his companion he was sud-
denly filled with a great wrath and a
hatred enough to drive out any fear of
the unknown the great creeper that
had been lying on the ground at the base
of the cottonwood now mounted upward
and was lost among the foliage of the
tree there was no trace of the dog

  both schommer and haverland ad-
vanced to the base of the vine and looked
about

  x marks the spot said schommer
grimly he scraped a cross into the
ground with one foot where lay a loose
scattering of splintered bones marrow
and all he continued nothing left
but splinters

  it was uncommonly dark in the woods
for today there was no sun eric looked
all around carefully then planted his
shovel firmly in the soft earth he eyed
the two engineers earnestly and rather
uneasily as they examined the creeper
wound all about the cottonwood

  the devil thats a big fellow
charlie said schommer that surely
cant be the one we saw lying on the
ground last night

  haverland shrugged the vine was
thick as a small tree but it was as
gnarled and twisted as though it had been
through torture

  you know he said this is all kind
of backward ive seen wind tear a vine
free but blowing it back up is a horse of
another color

  i don like it said eric the air was
charged with a musty pungent animal
smell at which he wrinkled his nose with
dislike i tink maybe i better go now
o k eric said schommer we
dont need you after all

  as he turned around and haverland
stooped to examine the bark of the vine
there was a rustle in the foliage overhead
that was not caused by any wind it was
the sound of innumerable bats in flight
the sound of leather in motion eric
jumped up and down with excitement
his jaws moving soundlessly as he point-
ed schommer stared at him marveling

  watch himself watch himself
shouted the finn finding his voice
wine come

  schommer glanced up then snatched
at haverland and hurled himself for-
ward the two men sprawled headlong
as the wine slipped from the tree and
fell behind them the leaves of the vine
were massed like a great green mush-
room and the whole growth fell limply
and heavily all at once smothering the
base of the cottonwood with a thud in a
solid mound of foliage

  well i will be damned said schom-
mer finding his feet and brushing him-
self off now what do you suppose
made that happen

  it fell said haverland slowly as if
to himself simply came loose and fell
vine terror



in a heap and we were directly beneath
it

  looks as though someone were wish-
ing us a lot of bad luck said schom-
mer laughing nervously now if i
were superstitious-

haverland said nothing but he was
subdued as he tramped back to the
car with schommer he had seen what
schommer had not seen just before the
vine had fallen that vine had a most
unnatural surface of flexible wrinkled
wood all covered with a kind of unholy
sweat the crevices of the bark were
thickly packed with parasites countless
numbers of small insects which conceiv-
ably could only be battening on the vine
itself these insects were lice uncom-
monly large well-fed lice in great num-
bers he considered this phenomenon
judiciously and humorously as the car
left the grader behind with the panting
exhausted eric and mounted the drive
to the garage behind the laboratories
half-way up the drive his restless eyes
saw something new

  were late he said breaking the
silence thats sloppy work too
eh schommer was surprized out of
a mood of his own when he had locked
the car and issued from the garage with
haverland he looked at his watch

   as a matter of fact charlie he said
were early only ten minutes to
haverland verified the time with a
glance at his own timepiece then he
looked mystified down the hill and said
plumbers are early then theyve
dug in

  where asked schommer puzzled
as he loaded his pipe haverland pointed
toward an oak near the bottom of the
hill where the ground was spaded up

  something clogged up the drain he
said probably the roots of that tree

looks as though theyve used a plow

doesnt it

  schommer squinted at the tree without
recognition the turf was broken all
the way down the lawn so that clods
formed a rough ditch running from the
walls of the laboratory directly into the
tree

  sloppy work repeated haverland
shaking his head

  schommer removed the pipe from his
teeth and followed the course of the
ditch with troubled eyes something be-
yond the tree attracted him he walked a
few paces down the lawn the ditch
continued on the other side of the tree to
the extreme bottom of the hill curious
technique-as though the plumbers were
hunting for the tree and couldnt find it
haverland slowly taking his place beside
schommer saw the loose flesh of schom-
mers face harden tighten till he seemed
ten years younger

  schommer raised his arm and pointed
at the tree with his pipe as though it were
a target and the pipe a gun then he
looked at haverland with eyes whose per-
plexity had something also of terror

  wonderful he ejaculated charlie
that tree wasnt there before

  what

  no the hill has always been clear
that tree is a good twenty paces up

 schommer-said haverland

through his teeth then he checked him-
self no need yet for the wild statements
he could make after all no one could
be really sure really certain that the fan-
tastic things he suspected had any basis in
fact he was silent schommer only re-
garded him curiously placing the pipe
again between his teeth then he drew
hurriedly against the almost dead fire in
the bowl as haverland proceeded farther
down the hill an oak tree that looked
all of a hundred years old immovable


weird tales

as rock a fresh leaf sailed out of the
foliage and reached the ground about ten
feet in front of him he picked it up
absently and as he stood there for a mo-
ment genuinely troubled he twisted the
leaf idly in his fingers and noted that it
was as limp and as tough as leather he
turned slowly and retraced his steps up
the hill

  more of those leaves and the leaves of
other trees in the woods flapped against
the windows of the building during the
day the wind was steadily rising
leaves like patterns cut in the skins of
animals

  some time ago there was that item in
the local paper concerning the tree that
had moved the laboratories people
told jokes about the ignorance and super-
stitions of the people who lived in south
how the hunkies hated the whine of the
generators the complicated glass and
metal apparatus and the living blue
sparks that jumped all over the labora-
tories like fireflies but finally the tree
had left the yard entirely to stand at the
edge of the woods now there was an
investigation sliding substrata were dis-
covered in which the roots were involved
odd that the layer of earth should have
moved uphill and now a tree on the
very hill on which the laboratories were
built playing the same tricks tearing up
the sod

during the day haverland several
times discovered schommer stand-
ing at the window area looking down
speculatively at the woods young har-
riss had the phenomenon pointed out to
him and twice left his work to make an
examination cowl shrugged he would
not have been surprized if a hen had
crowed after laying an egg

  the plumbers did come in the after-
noon having taken a sounding from the

building they dug in at a point midway
between the tree and the laboratories
advantage was taken of the ditch in the
turf since it was discovered that below
it down to the sewer was a cleavage line
of broken friable earth it was as though
a giant plow had followed the sewer-pipe
from end to end breaking the ground
actually one of the extraordinarily long
roots of the oak tree had entered a joint
in the pipes all manner of refuse had
caught on the obstruction and damned
the sewer effectively the difficulties of
repair however were negligible

  by this time the wind outside had be-
come rather heavy in the midst of which
the laboratories were an isolated calm
the wind occasionally gusted with still
increasing violence and now and then
small objects struck the walls and win-
dows with faint rappings haverland
could fancy he heard shoutings from
down the hill there was a waterfall of
sound among the cottonwoods at this
moment the night-bell rang

  with some degree of surprize and curi-
osity he left his chambers to see what
was wanted he was alone in the build-
ing it was late and this was a place
where few visitors came he had locked
the door of course after schommer had
gone at last and now to his further sur-
prize there was no one on the steps when
he opened it he stood there in the
doorway wondering it was those queer
little dark people in south and their total
lack of comprehension of the purpose in
these researches their distrust of every-
thing mechanical and their absolute fear
of electricity but it was rather a quaint
expression of hatred to ring the bell be-
cause the machinery whined annoying
too

  it was an unlucky night for ignorant
fearful people though the sky was
heavy with storm and the wind was
vine terror



speaking angrily through the cotton-
woods a handful of glossy leaves swept
up the hill and a creeper which had been
torn from the side of the building blew
across the walk and was shaken against
the steps haverland locked the door
and walked slowly back to his table

  mysterious something grimly face-
tious about the whole business all the
earmarks of a practical joke on a grand
scale trees that move vines that
plummet down fatly from trees that hold
them like great green spiders game
gradually and wantonly slaughtered
skeletons and splintered bones scattered
all through the woods something in the
woods concealed foul-smelling enough to
attract a ranging turkey buzzard vines
spongy with sap blowing around in the
road with the slightest breeze a labor-
ers fear of still disinhabited woods and
his flight from them a vine had tripped
schommer and so held him that he be-
came frightened vines clustering along
the road that provided the only means of
approach or retreat to the laboratories
blowing across it the way haverland
came to work and went home vines
tough enough to stop a road grader the
voice of eric shane saying wery juicy

  vines

  anger filled him again and he ex-
claimed aloud its a lie

  but the walls of the building flung the
shout into a trail of echoes from some
remote corner of his brain he plucked out
the impression of a bulb cf sliding crys-
tals that agnes the laboratory cat had
broken into the sink down the sewer
down the hill into the woods a thirsty
oak mounting the hill along the sewer
using its roots like the tentacles of an en-
foliaged devil-fish a wooden mole in
this whirl of half-thoughts he found the
skeleton of the cat outside his own win-
dow the bones completely disarticulat-

ed but still recognizable he heard the
voice of eric shane say

  i hear a cat scream-one time two
times up those hill

  there was something deadly in the
woods a killer that worked ceaselessly
stealthily that was not caught in any trap
set for it

  in the meantime the first few drops of
rain were being flung against the win-
dows with smart rappings like thrown
sand the vine that had been torn from
the walls thrashed against the building
and occasionally struck the windows in
the central chamber with that brittle
short sound peculiar to glass

  haverland hesitated only a moment as
pale violet lightning flickered among the
clouds then turned to the microscope on
die table he prepared a slide cleverly
like a magicians trick and slipped it
under his lenses one certain test he
adjusted his focus found something and
rigged up the delicate graduated instru-
ment that was apparently intended for
some occult measurement there he sat
hands on hips peering his face as grim
as death his thin lips recited some rit-
ual without sound

  yes schommer he heard himself
saying those are mighty queer vines
you can tell me nothing do you know
theres salt in their sweat eh did you
know their sap clots that it takes a
blood count like your blood and mine
ever hear em talking to each other at
night in those cursed woods with their
damned clicks and rubbings and whis-
pers what do you suppose they talk
about death

  but schommer was far away in the
city asleep by now haverland leaped
to his feet and knocked the microscope
crashing to the floor he had a grim pur-
pose in mind but even now was arrested
by the second ringing of the bell which


weird tales

broke the comparative silence in the
building in the most startling manner

it was a late hour for anyone to return
and the hunkies of south had all rather
sleep in coffins than come anywhere near
this place the bell continued to ring as
he made his way to the door someone
out there was passionately or mischiev-
ously ringing the bell again and again
longs and shorts staccato rings in series
rings that set the nerves on edge a whole
wild weird variety of ringings by some
impatient lunatic the bell still sounded
alarmingly when he reached the door
which he snatched open at once the
steps were devoid of any presence but his
own

  nearly hysterical with exasperation
haverland looked into the black wrath-
ful night but not for long a blockade
of vines crowded up the steps with a rush
and advancing tendrils whipped through
the doorway haverland flung the door
to with a re-echoing crash a few short
lengths of the vine were caught in the
crack and there they writhed like the
sprouting tails of snakes one he
gripped which instantaneously snapped
about his wrist and entered the flesh he
cried out with pain taking a shorter grip
on the vine with his other hand at the
same time bracing his feet against the
door he tugged with all his might gasp-
ing with panic it was like trying to
break a wet leather thong but the gods
gave him the advantage of weight and
terror the vine parted abruptly he
caught himself as he staggered crazily
past the first of the series of generators
that ran back from the door

  it was the thing that had nearly got
schommer vines gone soft vines turned
animal vines as flexible as rubber
vines whose wooden hearts had been
turned into some kind of unholy flesh

vile with rich putrid yellow sap those
tendrils remaining in the door writhed
spasmodically there was a heavy scraping
sound and they were withdrawn through
the crack with a powerful jerk leaving a
leaf or two in the room haverland still
held the piece that had broken off it
was quite limp like a rounded dirty
strip of flesh and was bleeding that
sticky pale yellow sap into his hand he
flung the thing away across the floor and
walked unsteadily back to his rooms
drawing the palms of his hands heavily
down his cheeks he could hear vines
beating against the door and grinding
along the walls unimaginable vines foul
things that were hosts to billions of lice
there was something definite and mali-
cious in their movement as they worked
along the window-ledges tapping at the
panes that were now streaming with mois-
ture

  in the downpour outside the trees in
the woods arched and lashed the air with
foliage haverland listened bewildered
to the stunning impact of barrage after
barrage of thunder and fancied that the
living voices that issued from the grove
of cottonwoods were many times multi-
plied then the lights throughout the
laboratories brightened unbearably as
the engineer approached the end of his
table the lights went out the wires had
gone down in the storm

  he stumbled over some rope-like
thing on the floor and noticed wildly as
he fell that the window was open some-
thing had come in he reached out in
the darkness however splintered with
lightnings and found it pulled at it
clutching it was like squeezing the com-
pact corded flesh of a squid a long
eel-shaped thing that passed through the
window into the outside

  at that moment ragged lightning
seemed to tear the southern sky in two
vine terror



answered by an eruption of light in the
north as the following thunder bat-
tered the place with sound haverland
stood up thrilling he had a brilliant
vision of the dying keene for indeed
this again was the legendary halo the
two colossal charges of electricity in the
sky seemed to serve as electrodes each
bolt a pole the laboratory between and
in this room the halo appeared once more
just as haverland had seen it over the
tube of gas three months past there
was a full mysterious effulgence through-
out the room a pale thin radiance
flowed out from the thing on the floor
and filled the room with a glory of soft
light by this illumination the engineer
saw that it was really a denuded length of
vine now more like a hideous tapering
worm saw too that there was scarcely a
leaf remaining on the tangle of vines at
the window in the glory of the halo
these boneless arms serpentined in a ter-
rible dance every tentacle glittered with
sweat in small beads that winked at the
lightning like innumerable eyes the
vine in the room began to raise itself
from the floor

  and now having formed a towering
closed palisade about it and accompanied
by the sound of shouting leaves and col-
liding trunks the vine-hung grove of cot-
tonwoods was advancing on the house
it was the sound of earthquake the hill
shook and metal clanged in the central
chamber of the laboratories followed a
stupendous crash haverland hurried to
the door half stunned

  through the broad windows of this
central chamber one commanded a view
of the entire countryside the hill itself
was just high enough to permit sight over
the foliaged heads of the oaks and cotton-
woods haverland looking down at the
trees saw the entire woods bathed in cold
flame the grove was one vast phos-

phorescence the tree-trunks glowed
and the masses of leaves shone like soft
burnished metal all the great vines
were alive with light and hung from the
trees in waterfalls of flame it was a
thing seen in a nightmare or read in a
fairy-tale another birnam wood that
was coming by degrees but surely
toward the central point that was the lab-
oratories the laboratory hill seemed to
rise from a chasm whose walls were solid
light trees and vines in motion be-
fore their advancing trunks and stems the
earth was rolling away in waves then
dark off in one end of the chamber the
engineer saw that the oak on the hill had
already entered the building the end
generator had been shouldered aside and
crashed through the floor into the base-
ment commotion was in the air the
storm entered the chamber with the oak
and rain beat on haverlands face

  and still it was not too late the en-
gineer whirled and retreated through his
own laboratories leaping the handful of
twining creepers in his way in the back
of the building he picked up a sledge-
hammer then raced back through the
smother of rain to the garage in which
stood three full drums of gasoline he
ran up the incline on which the drums
rested and worked rapidly with a wrench
he stepped back a little swung the sledge
in one heavy blow the drums released
tumbled booming down the runway
spilling their contents as they went and
bounded out the doorway to go careering
down the hill

  haverland waited dripping with rain
and perspiration then produced a box of
matches as he was about to strike a
light the heavens gaped and a volcano of
flame plunged cracking and thundering
into the woods like the finger of god

  haverland flung himself out of the
garage in time to escape the arm of fire


weird tales

that leaped up the hill from the back
of the laboratories he watched a tower of
flame boom up in the declining storm
above low thunders he heard three suc-
cessive explosions as the gasoline drums
went there was enough of it he felt
to suffocate if not to consume a shift
of wind carried the sound of crackling
and hissing vegetation and carried into
the engineers nostrils the charnel stench
of all the pyres of history sickened he
stumbled back into the laboratories

the following day dawned calm and
clear roman sholla came out early
and stood on his front lawn smoking his
pipe deliberately and looking up at the
hill a crew had appeared several hours
before and were making much noise as
they repaired the damage done to the lab-
oratories by a falling oak there had
been a strong unpleasant odor in the air
all morning which likely enough came
with the shift of the wind from the pack-
ing-plant in the city the members of
the crew as one occasionally came down
into south found the work distasteful
the stench seemingly worse the higher
one got up the hill

  one man alone in the building the
chief engineer haverland had escaped
serious injury when lightning had touched
off three drums of gasoline in the garage
and burned it the south woods had suf-
fered heavily with a number of the trees
and the extraordinarily large vines that
grew here either totally burned or badly
charred the famous oak that had taken
a journey away from shollas own yard
though not burned was now dead its
leaves already withered

  eric shane came out presently scratch-
ing his head and blinking cautiously he
and sholla were joined shortly by little
fred yanotsky and papa freng sholla
situated as he was nearest the laboratory

took on some importance he told how
the storm had wakened him the woods
had caught on fire somehow and three
explosions when those gasoline go
off illuminated the room he slept in

  it was one big bonfire he said hold-
ing out his arms

  he told of seeing the lightning strike

  big he said helplessly shaking his
head the bolt was indescribably huge
he could tell of the sharp burned-leather
and ozone smell in the air afterward
though and did but the thunder ah
they all remembered that sound of cata-
clysm when the big bolt struck but that
could not be described either

  shollas three friends were silent they
had said nothing yet and seemed very
much satisfied about something as they
looked up at the crew busy at the shat-
tered masonry and twisted metal above
them

  well fred said sholla what you
think of it eh

  i tink said dark little yanotsky
maybe it vas a good ting if all the plant
fall in never no good come of ma-
chines

  ah said sholla contemptuously
always the same crazy stubborn like
your father you should go to school
fred yanotsky

  this morning said white-haired
papa freng a squirrel came to my win-
dow for nuts he was very tame and
the first i have seen in a long time his
eyes were fixed on the dreaming distance
as he spoke something moving near by
brought him to sharp attention with
something of eagerness in his voice he
exclaimed look

  he pointed up the road a small cot-
tontail pursuing a rather aimless course
of exploration or foraging was proceed-
ing along the ditch nibbling at green
vine terror

t

shoots its way was blocked presently by
a creeper that lay along the road and
sagged under its own weight it was re-
markable in being almost totally leafless

  the rabbit in skipping over it sud-
denly froze as beast does in the presence
of beast but if the grotesque old keene
had been responsible for the mockery of
sentience in these singular growths of

south his ghost must have rested at last
the watchers saw the rabbit pass care-
lessly unmolested over the stiff tangle
of vines and disappear among the ruins
of the south woods roman sholla
walked the few paces up to the vine and
toeing its snarled trunks and leafless ten-
drills said

able revery

   written to music

by robert nelson

black roses sprout across the sky

pipes sing insensate neatli the sea

the clamant heads of madmen fly
and shatter with a dark outcry

as tones transpose to deeper dye
and leaves whirl wild with jubilee
through the mad organists rambling brain
in the disordered sepulcher
a ladys dead eyes strive to stir

she dares to laugh but all in vain
three-fingered hands paint a far frieze
with the black blood of vanquished devils
who sway and slay the music-breeze
in their daft and dying revels

now ebon fluids gin to flow
and drip with waxen candle-men

black disks of stone are trundling low
from the organs bosom fuming slow
fouler and sadder perfumes blow
to drown the bourns of demon ken
skulls flown from swarthy corpses kiss

and feed upon the organists soul
which neer doth cease to toll and roll
bell-like within this dusk abyss

fell plants and flowers writhe in wombs
of blighted worlds remote from morn
and musty myrrh exhales from tombs
whirling in utmost stars forlorn

swart suns on sounding waters swell
the turgid notes to direr din

and murky spirits soar from hell
to flap their cerements palpable
in the wild players face and tell
jet jewels into his mouth and spin
mad gossamers amid his hair

swift raven locks entwine his throat

the console wakes a weirder fear

his flaming fitful fingers chill

one tear he weeps a dead mans tear

 arail of the cloven hoof

by arlton eadie

                                                         one look was enough i snapped
                                                         off my flashlight and fled

 a startling weird mystery story of strange deaths on the desolate
 moor of exham and the mysterious creature known as
 the terror of the moor

the story thus far

while on a tramping vacation on
exmoor hugh trenchard dis-
covers an old recluse silas marie
lying unconscious after having been at-
tacked by a mysterious thing which
though speaking with a human voice
leaves behind it a trail of footprints
shaped like a cloven hoof

     

  seeking help at the nearest house a
private hospital hugh meets professor
felger the proprietor a sinister figure
whose features are hidden beneath a sur-
geons gauze mask the professor tries
to prevent hugh phoning the police but
he gets the message through by a strata-
gem afterward making his escape

  ronnie brewster a former fellow-stu-

                    w t-
the trail of the cloven hoof



dent of hughs is called in to attend to
silas maries injuries and one night
ronnie and hugh are astonished by the
arrival of a strange girl joan endean
apparently half dead with cold and ex-
haustion she recovers with suspicious
suddenness the moment she is alone with
hugh and to his unbounded amazement
informs him that she has just made her
escape from professor felgers institu-
tion which is really a private mental hos-
pital so convinced is hugh of her san-
ity that when dawker arrives to take her
back he resolutely refuses to give her up

  the police have been notified how-
ever and when sergeant jopling arrives
he finds that joan has gone but lying on
the bed is the body of silas marie
stabbed to the heart with a dagger whose
hilt is shaped like a cloven hoof later
that night the body is found to be miss-
ing and the only clue to its disappearance
is a trail of cloven hoofs beneath the bed-
room window

  andrew shale maries lawyer re-
quests an interview with hugh and in-
forms him that marie has signed a letter
of attorney giving hugh the benefit of
his fortune conditional on his giving
a solemn undertaking to use his utmost
endeavor to destroy the supernatural
monster which is referred to as the ter-
ror of the moor



nphere was a long pause after the law-
-i- yer had made his startling announce-
ment he carefully folded the doc-
ument laid it on the pile by his side
then once more leant forward on his
desk his chin resting on his interlocked
fingers his shrewd eyes fixed on the
young mans face

  hugh trenchard on his part found
himself utterly at a loss for words the

 this is the third installment of a fas-
dnating book-length serial story by
arlton eadie a british master of weird
fiction whose skill in building up eery
plots and gripping suspense is rapidly
winning him a well-deserved fame and
making new friends for his stories if
you have not yet reed the preceding
installments of this thrilling weird
mystery novel then you should begin
reading it with this issue for other-
wise you will be missing a real treat
for your convenience we preface this
installment of the trail of the cloven
hoof with a synopsis of the chapters
which have gone before

news of the unexpected legacy-for leg-
acy it was in spite of the lawyers respect
for legal nicety of expression-followed
so swiftly by the fantastic knight-errant
task on which it was conditional filled
him with an amazement too deep to be
expressed by the usual commonplaces of
speech his mind groped in vain for a
rational explanation was it the mere
desire for revenge that had induced silas
marie to offer his fortune as a reward for
the destruction of the mysterious thing
that had caused his death or was there
another a deeper motive

  well doctor trenchard the voice
of the lawyer snapped his train of
thought i suppose you would like a
little time in which to think over things
before coming to a decision

  it certainly seems to call for a little
serious thought hugh answered with a
smile

  the smile was reflected on shales fea-
tures as he shrugged his shoulders

  i should imagine that the answer to
that depends on your own belief in mat-
ters supernatural if you are convinced


weird tales

that this so-called terror of the moor
exists only in the imagination of my
client you may be inclined to settle the
matter by accepting right now it would
not be a very dangerous or difficult task
to rid the earth of a thing which is non-
existent

  thats very true mr shale but i
fear the matter is not to be so easily dis-
posed of in my own mind i am quite
certain that the moor is haunted by a-
well for the want of a more definite
name let us call it a monster which
though not necessarily supernatural in the
general meaning of the word is certainly
unknown to science i had already made
up my mind to get to the bottom of the
mystery and intended to take lodgings in
the nearest village so as to be as near the
scene as possible but that will not be
necessary now as you inform me that
moor lodge is my property would
there be any objection to my taking up
my residence there immediately

  andrew shale shook his head

  your claim to the estate is incontest-
able the more so in view of the fact that
mr marie has no living relatives the
legal formalities may take a day or two
but i will hand you the keys of the house
now if you wish to take possession im-
mediately i think you may rest assured
that no one will dispute your presence
there-mr shale paused and a slow
smile twisted his parchment-like features
-unless it be the fabled terror of the
moor

  a few minutes later the interview ter-
minated and hugh hurried back to tell
his friend of the new and unexpected
development that had taken place

ronnie was profuse in his congratula-

-	tions

  well if youre not the luckiest lad
ever he exclaimed you cant even

get lost in a fog without barging up
against a millionaire with a fortune to
give away

  what makes you think that silas
marie was a millionaire

  ronnie laughed gayly

  i know because ive been using the
highly specialized gray matter which i
carry beneath my hat my mode of de-
duction would do credit to the superest
super-sleuth that ever sleuthed listen
and i will expound i have sufficient
knowledge of the habits of my fellow-
bipeds to know that when a man wears a
suit as old and as shabby as that of silas
maries hes either very rich or very poor
silas marie could not have been poor or
he could not have bequeathed you any-
thing therefore he was a very rich man
a millionaire is a very rich man there-
fore silas marie was a millionaire q e
d as my friend euclid used to say

  i only hope youre right said hugh
laughing but you seem to forget that
i shall have to do something for the
money

  slay one full-sized dragon nodded
ronnie saint george up to date
what a pity miss endean has disappeared
-she could have fitted in with the gen-
eral scheme of things by taking the role
of the enchanting princess but you are
surely not taking that terror stuff serious-
ly are you

  hugh drew meditatively at his pipe
upon my word old chap i hardly
know whether i do or not he said pres-
ently a look of indecision on his tanned
face sometimes the whole affair seems
so fantastic that it would be a positive
relief if i could think it was all a night-
mare but i cant and thats the trouble
but hang it all this is the twentieth
century-not the dark ages expostu-
lated his friend what data have you
got a few footprints made by a cloven
the trail of the cloven hoof



hoof-footprints which the harborer of
the staghounds a man who has grown
gray on these moors declares to have
been the slot of an old stag

  hugh trenchard shook his head

  i would only be too glad to accept
that explanation if i could ronnie but
i know well enough that it was no stag
that i encountered the night marie was
attacked

  then what on earth was it

  thats what im going to find out-
and before long too hugh started to
his feet and began to pace the room rest-
lessly his lean jaws were tightly
clenched and there was a light of battle
in his eyes there must be some ex-
planation-a natural and logical explana-
tion that will fit the facts as we know
them the trouble is that ive grasped
the tangled skein haphazard and every
attempt to straighten out the snarl only
makes the confusion worse once the
end of a thread is in my hands the whole
tangle may straighten out with one

pull-

  you remind me of my old granny
soliloquizing over her knitting ronnie
interrupted flippantly what do you
say to getting the car out and having a
look at your new home you may pick
up a few clues you know he added
with a grin

hugh needed no second invitation
ten minutes later he was seated in
ronnies small but powerful car being
piloted through the winding lanes which
led to the great uplands of the moor
each was busy with his own thoughts
and it was not until half the distance had
been covered that ronnie broke the si-
lence

  so you have really decided to take up
your residence at moor lodge

  hugh glanced round in some surprize

  of course what better center could
i have for my investigations

  ho ho-investigations his friend
chuckled as he repeated the word with
exaggerated dramatic emphasis that
seems as if youre going into the detec-
tive business in real earnest but surely
you cant be thinking of living at that all-
forsaken place like robinson crusoe on
his island

  well i had thought of asking you to
act as my man friday for a bit but its
not fair to make you neglect your prac-
tise

  ronnie brewster gave a somewhat rue-
ful laugh

  up to the present my practise is still
in the nebulous stage of development
he confessed if moor lodge were con-
nected with the town by phone i would
almost as easily make my calls from there
but it wouldnt be worth while to run a

line out here-

  why not install a couple of wireless
sets hugh made the suggestion half
in jest but to his surprize ronnie jumped
at the idea

  the very thing he exclaimed it
ought not to be difficult to get a transmit-
ting license and then we could be in
touch with each other even when i was
not stopping at your place and it would
be very handy to be able to send out an
s o s if you happened to wake up in
the night and find a gentleman with a
cloven foot leaning over the bed-rail ask-
ing you if it is to be roast or boiled
ronnie was on his favorite subject
now and he kept on in the same vein of
half-cynical banter until they came in
sight of the red-tiled gables and quaint
twisted chimneys of moor lodge softly
outlined against the grayish-purple sweep
of the distant hills

creepy-looking shack isnt it was
his final comment as they alighted if


weird tales

there isnt a genuine blown-in-the-glass
dyed-in-the-wool family spook on the
premises-well all i can say is that the
builder ought to be prosecuted for obtain-
ing shudders under false pretenses
obtaining shutters hugh repeated
in a tone which showed his thoughts had
been wandering from the others light-
hearted chatter

  wake up cried the indignant ron-
nie who said anything about shutters

i	was talking about shudders-s-h-u-d-
d-e-r-s-two ds and the h is silent as
in pudding 

  i get you laughed his friend what
a lad you are for a joke ronnie you
really must take up your quarters here-
the murmur of your baby prattle will be
like a ray of sunshine in this gloomy old
house

  anything to oblige old bean ron-
nie smirked with the air of one acknowl-
edging a well-deserved compliment but
the next moment his grin vanished as he
laid his hand on the other mans shoul-
der but seriously hugh i hope you
dont mind my silly nonsense he went
on in an altered voice you see i have
to be so preternaturally wise and solemn
when ive got my bedside manner on
that its quite a relief to blow the cork
out now and again

  come and stay with me invited
hugh trenchard and you never need
put the cork in at all

  ronnie gave a laugh and smacked his
lips with mock gusto

  that sounds alluringly festive ill
think it over

hugh had not been jesting when he
had described the house as a gloomy
old place for it looked almost as eery
in the bright sunshine as it had looked
in the mist-dimmed moonlight when he
had first seen it it was a structure of tol-

erable antiquity and had probably been
built as a lodge for one of the yeoman
rangers when exmoor was one of the
royal preserves one had not to look
very closely to detect the marks imprinted
by the passing years the tiles of the
high-pitched roof were toned to a deep
mellow red the oaken beams of the half-
timbered walls were weathered to a gray-
ish drab the intersecting plaster was in
places stained a sickly green by the drip-
pings from the eaves and its whole sur-
face starred and cracked until it resem-
bled the face of a wrinkled hag there
are some houses upon which the hand of
time seems to have been laid with be-
nign touch - gray havens of peace and
quietude or stout old manor-houses
whose wide hearths remind one of the
crackling of yule logs whose cheerful
panelled walls still seem to retain a kind-
ly echo of the songs and laughter of top-
booted red-faced squires oak-roofed
halls which still seem to ring with the
merry strains of sir roger de coverly
painted and gilded salons where one
seems to catch the measured rhythm of
viols and harpsichord and the light tap-
ping of red-heeled shoes in the stately
minuet

  but there are others whose dusty cham-
bers are shadowy aloof and mysterious
-fit settings for whispered plots cloaked
and masked figures flitting like sinister
shadows or stealthy deeds which shunned
the light of day and of such was the
house of which hugh trenchard had
come to take possession

  the footsteps of hugh and his com-
panion echoed eerily as they passed along
the passage on the ground floor entering
each room in turn and throwing back the
curtains which shrouded the windows
passing through the darkest part of the
passage hughs left-hand sleeve caught
in something which projected from the
the trail of the cloven hoof



wall he drew his hand over the surface
of the panelling and uttered an exclama-
tion as he felt an unmistakable door-
knob

  hullo i never noticed a door here
before i wonder where it leads to

  if it leads to the wine-cellar ill give
an unsolicited testimonial to your detec-
tive abilities right now laughed ronnie
come on lets see what sort of a tap the
old boy kept

  its locked said hugh tugging in
vain at the handle

  try some of the keys that shale gave
you suggested his friend if they fail
well have to try a little gentle persuasion
with the kitchen poker

  but there was no need for the burglar-
ious proposals to be put into operation
for the lock clicked smoothly back when
hugh inserted the third key on the bunch

  ah-ha the mystery deepens ronnie
exclaimed dramatically as he peered
through the open doorway who would
expect to find an up-to-date chemical lab-
oratory in the wilds of exmoor

  hugh nodded in silent agreement the
room in which they found themselves
could have been used for no other pur-
pose the whole of one wall was cov-
ered with glass-fronted cupboards and
inside could be seen row upon row of
jars bottles and phials standing against
another wall was a long breast-high
bench bearing an orderly array of retorts
test-tubes scales and recording-instru-
ments a powerful electric battery stood
in one corner flanked in the opposite
angle of the room by a large and very
modern-looking safe a roll-top desk
and a filing-cabinet occupied the center
of the room and toward these ronnie
gave an expressive nod

  there ought to be plenty of data for
your investigations here he observed
with a smile there seem to be enough

papers and memoranda to clear up a
thousand mysteries and the desk is not
even locked-or the cabinet either see
here

  he thrust back the cover of the desk
and began to rummage among the pa-
pers only to give vent to a grunt of dis-
appointment

  nothing that is likely to help us
here he declared bills invoices for
chemicals and apparatus supplied-the
old boy seems to have been a whale for
experimental chemistry stop a moment
though he added suddenly as he opened
the lowest drawer heres something
that may shed a little light on our dark-
ness just run your eagle eye over
these--

  glancing at the official-looking doc-
uments which ronnie spread on the desk
hugh saw that one was a printed form
bearing the royal arms at its head it was
an official certificate of discharge and
the words which had been filled in by
hand intimated that marle silas james
bad been employed in the investiga-
tion branch of the research
laboratories of the royal ar-
senal woolwich from april the
rd  to october the th 
being discharged therefrom at his own
request another was a well-worn pass
enclosed in a leather case authorizing the
same marle silas fames to enter the
area of the danger buildings at the
royal arsenal

  evidently our friend was a retired ex-
pert in explosives ronnie remarked i
dont think theres much to be gathered
from these papers beyond that not very
interesting fact

  trenchard did not answer immediately
he was staring at the blue-gray papers
his mind working rapidly at length he
turned to brewster with an unexpected
question
	weird tales

  does the date april the rd 
suggest anything to you

  the other man thought for a few mo-
ments then shook his head

  of course the war was on at that
time-that accounts for marie being em-
ployed in manufacturing or inventing
explosives-

  but he need not have had anything
to do with explosives at all hugh broke
in excitedly it was on april the rd
that the first german attack was made in
which they used asphyxiating gas silas
marie may have been employed in evolv-
ing retaliatory counter-measures

  ronnie brewster received his chums
suggestion with a careless shrug

  interesting but scarcely informative
was his comment i flatter myself im
not particularly slow in the uptake but
im hanged if i can see any connection
between a retired government chemist
and that precious cloven-hoofed terror of
yours why not see what is in the safe

  hugh nodded and selecting the like-
liest-looking key on the ring inserted it
in the brass-rimmed keyhole it fitted-
it turned-the ponderous bolts slid back
grasping the handle hugh gave it a half-
turn and the heavy door swung open and
as it did so a loud gasp of amazement
escaped his lips

  until that moment he had scarcely
paused to consider what a safe of these
dimensions might contain for all he
knew he might be confronted with the
dead body of marie in a repulsive state
of decomposition but the object which
met his gaze was less gruesome though
not less surprizing

  the sole content of the safe was a long
bulky sealed packet in every respect the
counterpart of the one given to him by
joan endean



a look of the blankest mystification
spread over hughs features as his
eyes fell on the duplicate sealed packet
for it was an exact duplicate not only in
its general size and bulk but down to
such details as the peculiar texture of the
paper and the heraldic device which
adorned the large red seal such a like-
ness could not possibly be accidental
either the packet lying before him was
the same one that had been stolen from
him in the valley of rocks or else this
was the genuine packet which the decoy
one-containing nothing but blank pa-
pers-had been intended to safeguard
in any case the presence of the latter in
maries safe formed a strange and unex-
pected link between him and the myste-
rious joan endean

  whats wrong old man ronnies
voice tinged with a note of amused sur-
prize brought hughs speculations to an
abrupt end youve been staring at that
letter as though you were expecting to see
it vanish in a whiff of brimstone i be-
lieve the greedy beggar is disappointed
because the safe wasnt packed tight
with wads of bank-notes

  scarcely that hugh forced a smile
as he shook his head but that letter
happens to be a perfect facsimile of-
he paused suddenly calling to mind
joans stipulation of secrecy adding a
trifle lamely-of-of another letter that
i have seen

  nothing wonderful in that was the
others careless rejoinder most letters
have a family likeness on the outside-
its what is inside them that makes all the
difference between a tender missive of
love and a curt intimation that a check by
return mail will oblige

  trenchard picked up the letter and bal-
anced it thoughtfully in his hand as he
read the superscription
the trail of the cloven hoof



  to hugh trenchard m d

  beneath apparently written by the
same hand though in weak and shaky
characters was the injunction only to
be opened in the event of the death or
disappearance of mr silas marie

  pardon my idle curiosity said ron-
nie trying to speak indifferently in spite
of his impatience at his friends tardiness
arent you going to open the thing
hugh again weighed the letter in his
hand then he shook his head

  not here old chap judging by the
weight this is a somewhat lengthy com-
munication i think it would be more
cheerful and comfortable to read it before
a nice bright fire besides - hugh
pointed to the single window of the lab-
oratory already dimming in the early
dusk-probably it will be dark in here
before ive finished and-unless im
very much mistaken-the contents of this
packet will not sound any the better for
being read in the gloaming

returning to the library they lighted
 the lamp drew the curtains and set

a match to the fire which was ready laid
in the grate then and then only did
hugh break the seal draw forth several
closely written sheets of foolscap and
commence to read

  dear doctor-

  when you read these lines i shall be
dead or i shall have disappeared which
practically amounts to the same thing
and you may regard what i have to state
as a revelation coming from the grave
considering the very short time i have
known you it will undoubtedly come as a
surprize to you that i should single you
out as my confidant but you may be-
lieve me when i say that i have not re-
posed this trust in you because my time
is short and i have little choice in the mat-
ter i flatter myself that i am a keen and

accurate judge of character and i know
that your acceptance of the strange task
which i have imposed on you will not be
actuated by the mere sordid desire to pos-
sess my money moreover i have trav-
elled in the east long enough to have my
mentality tinged and more than tinged
with the fatalism of the orient i do not
believe that it was mere blind chance that
led your footsteps through the mist guid-
ing you to me in my hour of need send-
ing in you a champion young clear-
thinking with sound nerves and a healthy
body surely it was fate-maybe a power
even higher-that ordained the appear-
ance at the very moment i was stricken
down of the very man whom i should
have chosen out of all the world as the
one best fitted to carry on the work i had
begun that the work is not free from
danger my own fate will be sufficient
proof whether the end justifies the risk
you must judge for yourself but this
much i will say here-no mail-clad cru-
sader knight ever rode forth on a holier
or more righteous cause than the one you
will follow in ridding the earth of the
terror of the moor

  it would be both tedious and unnec-
essary to give even a brief account of my
eventful life suffice to say that the out-
break of war in  found me a lecturer
on chemistry at a university in the north
of england i soon found my post a
sinecure however for the whole of the
students joined the army in a body one
afternoon and i was left facing rows of
empty benches i myself was too old
for military service so i transferred my
activities to a munition factory that had
been newly opened in the neighborhood
and for the next six months or so i was
employed in the simple routine wrork of
checking the purity of the various chem-
icals used in the manufacture of explo-
sives the work though of course re-


weird tales

sponsible and fairly dangerous was not
hard in itself and i frequently found my-
self compelled to wait for hours in the
great well-equipped laboratory with
nothing whatever to do

  it was during these periods that i be-
gan to make a few experiments on my
own account and as a result i was able
to suggest some minor improvements
both in the mode of handling and the
actual proportions of the ingredients
used but beyond a mere formal ac-
knowledgment of my communications
the war office took no notice and i
quite thought that my letters were repos-
ing in some dusty pigeon-hole when on
the twenty-third of april  i re-
ceived an urgent and imperative order to
proceed to london

  upon my arrival at kings cross sta-
tion i was met by an eminent statesman
a man whose features the cartoonist and
camera-man have made familiar to every
inhabitant of the kingdom

   professor marie i presume he
said coming forward with outstretched
hand

  in the shock of surprize i blurted out
his name but he immediately shook his
head in smiling remonstrance

   i fear i can not lay claim to such a
famous name-even at the time i noted
the ambiguous nature of his disclaimer-
a moments reflection should convince
you that you have been misled by a chance
resemblance he spoke coolly but the
twinkle in his eye told me that i was not
intended to take his word too literally
as a matter of fact you must consider
me as belonging to the good old welsh
family of jones 

    an extensive clan i said falling in
with his humor and what might your
business be with me mr jones

   important but in no way official i
hope you understand that perfectly he

repeated the words slowly and emphat-
ically in no way official you must make
up your mind to regard me as merely be-
ing a certain mr jones a private and
undistinguished englishman who has the
welfare of his country at heart is that
quite clear

    quite

   then be pleased to follow me

  a big limousine was waiting a few
yards away the door held open by a
liveried footman whose stature quite
dwarfed my companion as we emerged
into the station courtyard two other cars
started into motion taking up their posi-
tion one ahead and one behind the car
we were in and my wonder grew as i
noted the burly forms and watchful eyes
of their occupants mr jones might
modestly proclaim himself an ordinary
private citizen but it was evident that he
had the resources of scotland yard at his
beck and call

  the three cars turned west zigzag-
ging through the mean streets which lie
between kings cross and new oxford
street and as we headed south i made
sure that we were bound for downing
street but ve skirted the north side of
trafalgar square swinging down the
darkened mall leaving buckingham pal-
ace on our right there was a traffic
block opposite victoria station but a
brief silent signal from the leading car
cleared a way as if by magic and a few
minutes later we were heading down the
kings road at racing speed i caught
a glimpse of the river as we passed over
putney bridge but lost my bearings com-
pletely in the dimly lighted suburban
roads beyond when at last we pulled
up before a large country mansion i
knew that i must be somewhere in the
neighborhood of richmond but that was
all
the trail of the cloven hoof



he door swung open as we ascend-
ed the front steps and i was ush-
ered into a cheerful dining-room where
a meal lay already spread mr jones
was a brilliant talker and throughout the
meal he kept up a flow of interesting
conversation without however once
hinting at the nature of the business
which he had brought me there to dis-
cuss it was only when we had adjourned
to the smoking-room with one detective
patrolling the gravel walk in front of the
windows and another keeping watch in
the passage outside the door that he
placed his hand in his pocket and pro-
duced a small sheet of paper

   did you write that he asked in a
conversational tone

  i nodded wondering what was com-
ing next for the thing was merely one
of the letters that i had sent to the min-
istry of munitions suggesting a quite
minor and unimportant modification of
the formula of one of the stock explo-
sives but before i could frame the ques-
tion that was in my mind he turned the
sheet over and pointed to some chemical
symbols scribbled in pencil on the back

   and this too i presume he went
on watching me keenly the while

   i took the paper in my hand and read
chng ceh chnsoe
chno chn there
was a sixth combination of symbols but
this i must not divulge even to you so
for the purpose of this narrative i will
refer to it simply as the x formula

  in a flash i realized what had hap-
pened i must have been jotting down
some notes respecting my experiments
and i had inadvertently used the same
sheet of paper on which to write my let-
ter to the ministry

    yes i was forced to admit that is
my handwriting but i certainly had no
idea that there was anything on the back

of that sheet when i sent that letter to
you

   i can well believe that mr jones
smiled somewhat grimly its extremely
fortunate that the communication did not
fall into other hands however i have
not brought you here to call you over the
coals for being so careless it is rather
to ask you for a friendly explanation of
what was in your mind when you made
those notes

   you know the meaning of the for-
mulas

  mr jones nodded his gray head
naturally in these days when every
newspaper is full of the spy peril we
should not allow a set of mysterious-
looking letters and figures to pass through
our hands without wanting to know the
meaning of it within an hour of its
receipt that letter was in the hands of a
government analyst but his report only
seemed to deepen the mystery he states
that the first three formulas respectively
represent creatine inosite and albumen
-three organic substances which are to
be found in every human body while the
last three combinations of symbols rep-

newly invented devastite - three of the
most powerful explosives known to sci-

substances not only innocuous in them-

vital to the human organism combine
the same elements in different propor-

tial living bomb

weird tales

the man who would have faced a hostile
house without a tremor now sank into
his chair deathly white and unnerved it
did not need more explanation to enable
his keen far-seeing brain to visualize the
awful possibilities of my discovery yet
i could see that he was struggling to dis-
believe me

   it-its incredible he gasped at

last why if what you say is true-

   why waste words words may
sway the thoughts and actions of men
but the most transcendent eloquence is
powerless to affect the elements of nature
compare those sets of symbols and tell
me honestly if you-without the assist-
ance of a chemical expert-could say off-
hand which represents say creatine the
crystalline substance which is contained
in your own muscles at this present mo-
ment and the high explosive which goes
by the name of devastite consider again
that the very air we breathe consists of
four-fifths of nitrogen-and it is scarcely
necessary to remind a man occupying your
post that nitrogen forms the basic prin-
ciple of almost every explosive known
then ask yourself whether it is beyond
the power of modern science to make
practical use of those facts i know that
you will probably remind me in your
turn that the use of that particular ex-
plosive devastite has been discontinued
because it has been found liable to
detonate spontaneously through decom-
position but my answer is that such a
defect is a defect only so long as the
explosive is within our lines-the mo-
ment it is within the enemy lines the
more easily it explodes the better each
soldier in the vast armies arrayed against
us contains within himself the means of
his own destruction it but needs one
single element harmless in itself to be
incorporated in a gas and sent over the
enemy trenches and the next few hours

would see a holocaust such as the world
has never known

t or a long time my companion
a looked at me without speaking so
that was your idea

  i felt myself flush at his tone it cer-
tainly was my idea but i abandoned it
 why he asked quickly

   it was too horrible too fiendish too

frightful-

   frightful he pounced on the word
like a swooping hawk do you know
who has taught us that word who has
advocated the doctrine of ruthless fright-
fulness backing it up with specious argu-
ments that the most terrible weapons are
the most merciful because they make the
struggle of opposing nations shorter our
foes have taught us that-and now they
shall be confounded by their own text-
hoist with their own petard in real
earnest put whatever price you please
on your own services-we must have that
gas i hope i pray that we may never
need to employ it but we must have it-
or the knowledge of its preparation-to
use as a last resort

  i will not weary you with a recapit-
ulation of the arguments he employed
before i consented to renew my re-
searches but i made one stipulation
the secret of the gas mustremain in my
own possession contained in a sealed en-
velope that would only be handed to him
when i was convinced that no other alter-
native remained than the complete de-
struction of the british empire but for-
tunately i was not called upon to make
that momentous decision for when the
united states of america became our
allies there was very little doubt as to the
ultimate result of the war

  the peril has passed - but has it
passed for all time if i could have
answered that question with an unhesitant
the trail of the cloven hoof



affirmative i would have committed the
secret to the flames but ever at the back
of my mind there lurked a fear that the
world might be confronted with another
even graver crisis when the possession
of my secret would be the deciding factor
between victory and defeat for you may
rest assured that whoever holds the sealed
packet which i hereby give into your
hands holds in his hands the destiny of
mankind guard it i entreat you as a
sacred trust as something even dearer
than life for once it falls into the
hands of the emissaries of a nation whose
ambition is the domination of the world
carnage and hideous chaos will follow as

surely as the night follows day and-

  a harsh command cut through tren-
chard s voice like the stroke of an ax

up with your hands-both of you
three shadowy figures each holding a
levelled revolver stood in the doorway



the grim command backed as it was
by muzzles of three weapons trained
with such deadly accuracy as to make
them appear like so many circles of steel
left no alternative but to obey hugh
and ronnie raised their hands above
their heads

  keep em there and dont move ex-
cept as i tell you said the man who had
spoken before to his companions he
added but without turning his head
keep the red-headed chap covered
dawson ill see that the other one be-
haves himself regan give em a frisk
one of the men stepped forward and
ran his hands lightly over hughs cloth-
ing in a very few seconds he had found
and removed the revolver which hugh
had carried in his hip pocket ever since
the death of silas marie

  well heeled eh the spokesman
of the party took up the weapon with his

disengaged hand and glanced at the con-
ical bullets which nestled in the chambers
of the cylinder see what sort of artil-
lery the red-headed chaps got in the back

of his pants-

  look here old sport remonstrated
ronnie not so much of the red-headed
chap i know im not exactly a bru-
nette but-

  shut up youll have plenty of time to

squawk when- the rest of his remark

was drowned in ronnies sudden cackle
of laughter as the searcher inserted his
fingers beneath his armpits whats the
game now getting hysterical 

  no-ticklish i never could bear any
one to touch me there if you do not de-
sist i shall give one long scream and bite
your face i will-if it poisons me
stow your jaw ordered the searcher
roughly where do you pack your gat
ronnie looked pained

  gat what vulgarity of terminology
we always refer to it as a lethal weapon
in our set well if youre going to
probe my anatomy until you find one
youll wear your fingers into fists before
you get the gat i havent got if you
manage to find anything on me more
deadly than a fountain-pen ill present
you with a fiver for your trouble

  the searcher paused and glanced round
at the man who appeared to be the lead-
er of the party

  you heard that sir he asked in a
tone of virtuous triumph i call on you
to witness that he offered me a bribe in
the execution of my duty

  your duty gasped hugh a light
beginning to dawn on him you dont
mean to tell me that you are policemen
by no means was the answer given
somewhat stiffly we are detectives be-
longing to the special investigation
branch of scotland yard i am detec-
tive-inspector renshaw and it is my duty


weird tales

to take you into custody for being on en-
closed premises at night for a supposed
unlawful purpose and it is my duty to
warn you that anything you may say may

be taken down and-

  oh my sacred aunt wailed ronnie
suddenly collapsing in the nearest chair
and hiding his face in his hands

  -used in evidence the inspec-
tor produced a note-book ill trouble
you for your names and the last addresses
at which you slept

  ronnies shoulders ceased shaking as
he rose to his feet

  put down the red-headed chap as au-
burn harry of wapping he said grave-
ly you know-the man who strangled
five policemen with his bare hands my
accomplice in crime-pal is the correct
term i believe-is cross-eyed dick of

shadwell-

  shut up you ass hugh interrupt-
ed then he turned to the detectives im
afraid there have been mistakes on both
sides inspector you apparently took us
for a couple of crooks and your dramatic
entry certainly made us think you were
three gentlemen of the same kidney as
a matter of fact i am doctor trenchard
the present owner of this house and this
is my friend doctor brewster

  inspector renshaw looked at him half
incredulously i suppose you have some
proof of what you say he asked at
length

  not here im afraid but mr an-
drew shale maries solicitor will vouch
for me as will also sergeant jopling of
the local police

the inspector did not verbally inti-
mate that the explanation was satis-
factory but his action was eloquent he
handed the revolver back to hugh

  hope we didnt scare you with our
gun-play sir

  hugh laughed

  oh im getting used to scares since
coming down here for a quiet holiday
the rest cure hasnt been a success
eh inspector renshaw nodded in a
manner that was intended to convey sym-
pathy weve heard all about the funny
business that has been going on here and
for the past few days the place has been
under observation when my man re-
ported that hed seen two men enter i
rushed over at once and thought id got
a capture

  you must have hustled ronnie put
in speaking in a tone of admiring re-
spect unless you were camping some-
where on the moor you must have start-
ed soon after we entered this house i
am rather curious to know how your man
managed to tip you off so promptly

  the inspector shrugged and permitted
himself a cryptic smile

  oh we have our methods sir he
said with an air of mystery some peo-
ple are very fond of sneering at us and
hinting that the mental development of
the c i d got atrophied somewhere in
the mid-victorian era they are apt to
remember our failures and forget the fact
that scotland yard delivers the goods-
in the shape of the wanted man-nine
times out of ten we dont advertise
every new invention we adopt but i can
tell you this-at one hours notice i could
get enough men here to search every
square yard of this moor big as it is
thats the stuff to give em cried
ronnie approvingly i bet youve got
a wireless set and a few airplanes and
half-a-dozen tanks up your sleeve some-
where i thought i and my friend were
going to enjoy a nice little spook-hunt all
on our own but now youve come in all
well have to do is sit tight and read all
about it in the papers of course you
have a theory
the trail of the cloven hoof



  inspector renshaw gave a non-commit-
tal shrug

  i dont set much store on theories
when i can get hold of solid facts you
seem to have got hold of a few he made
a gesture toward the sheets of manuscript
on the table i suppose you have been
going through the dead mans papers
as he had a perfect right to do ron-
nie interposed briskly seeing that the
whole of silas maries property devolves

on him-

  of course of course inspector ren-
shaw hastened to say my remark was
not intended as a criticism of your action
doctor trenchard i was merely anxious
to know if you have found anything that
will shed light on the mysterious happen-
ings here

  well not directly hugh answered
after a pause during which he did some
hard thinking the only salient facts
contained in the papers i have already
read are that marie was a chemist who
had made a special study of the chemical
warfare which the late war brought into
being and had invented a novel and-at
any rate theoretically-effective method
of wholesale slaughter you are quite
welcome to hear the remainder of his nar-
rative but i warn you i shall skip any
passage which appears to be of a private
or personal nature

  thats fair enough assented ren-
shaw to his subordinates he added
you two keep watch outside and see
that we are not disturbed

when they had the room to them-
selves hugh took up the thread of
silas maries story

  my conditions were accepted without
the slightest demur i was to be given
an absolutely free hand in making my re-
searches but merely as a matter of form
i was entered on the payroll of the lab-

oratory staff of the royal arsenal wool-
wich but it was very seldom that i en-
tered the gates of that establishment for
i quickly realized that my work was too
hazardous to be carried on in the same
vicinity where large quantities of explo-
sives were being manufactured and
stored i looked out for a spot lonely
and remote from human habitations and
at last i decided to buy a dilapidated and
reputedly ghost-haunted house known as
moor lodge situated on the most des-
olate part of exmoor

   needless to say i did not go out of
my way to refute the grisly legends re-
specting the old house for i counted on
them ensuring me the seclusion i so much
desired one of the rooms i fitted up as
a laboratory and there i labored to con-
vert my dream into a tangible practicable
reality

   no galley-slave ever toiled harder at
his oar than i toiled at my bench during
the first three months we lived here
alone my dear wife and i and sometimes
whole weeks would go by without either
of us seeing a strange face she knew
that i was engaged in confidential work
for the government but little did she
guess the nature of that work

   but gradually the strain began to tell
on me i was far from being a young
man and in addition to my experiments
i was obliged to perform the rough work
of the house for my wife was not strong
physically though nothing could have
exceeded her love and devotion to me
it was almost impossible to hire a domes-
tic servant at that time when the prospect
of earning high wages was tempting every
able-bodied girl to the munition factories
even in normal times i doubt whether any
local girl would have consented to spend
a single night in a house with such a
ghostly reputation as moor lodge i
even journeyed to plymouth and inter-
 

weird tales

viewed several discharged soldiers and
sailors who had been disabled in the war
but they all seemed too intelligent for
my purpose-i simply dared not risk hav-
ing a man on the premises who might so
much as guess at the nature of the work
on which i was employed things were
at a deadlock when fate brought to my
door the very man i needed

  no doubt you will call to mind how
severe the weather was in the winter of
- it was by far the worst winter
in the war the ponds and wells were
frozen solid and the very earth seemed
blighted with the intense cold toward
evening on one of the bitterest days i
was working in the laboratory when there
came a light timid tap on the front door
the sound was so unusual in that desolate
region that for a moment i attributed it
to a fall of half-melted snow from the
roof but presently there came another
tap this time accompanied by a low half-
articulate moan i caught up the nearest
weapon handy-which happened to be a
short iron bar which i had been using as
a poker for my furnace-and made my
way to the door outside was a man
dressed in a ragged and mud-plastered
khaki uniform the badges and buttons
had been roughly torn off so that the
tunic was open showing the gray shirt
beneath he wore no cap and his hands
and face were blue with the cold

    hullo i said staring at him

    he was leaning against the door-post
as though for support and at the sound
of my voice he raised two deeply sunken
lack-luster eyes to mine

   hullo matey he responded weakly

   what are you doing here i de-
manded youll catch your death of cold
if you go about half dressed in this
weather

   im half dead already matey and
as though to prove his words he stag-

gered forward and would have fallen if
i had not caught him in time

  when i put my arms round him i got
a shock the man was nothing but skin
and bone and when i lifted him he
weighed no heavier than a large child
he was starved-not starved with the
cold as they say hereabouts but literally
starved with hunger i got him into the
living-room pulled him round with a
stiff glass of brandy then ransacked the -
larder and watched him eat eat-i
thought he would never stop eating and
as he wolfed the platefuls i took a good
look at him

is age could not have been more
than eighteen or twenty but he
was tall and big-made and when in his
usual health he must have been unusually
strong his hair was fair and inclined
to be curly and i judged by its length
that some considerable time had elapsed
since it had last received the attentions of
a military barber his features were
prominent but not unpleasing-indeed
had it not been for the curious expression
in his eyes he might have been considered
handsome i find it difficult to convey
that expression in words it was at once
wary alert shifting and restless but
the only way in which i can make my
meaning clear is to describe it as an
animal look-not that which one sees in
the eyes of an intelligent dog or even a
cat or any domesticated animal rather
was it the look of instinctive hostility and
distrust which one may see in the eyes of
a wild beast untamed and untamable as
it roams its native wilds i took but little
heed of this strange trait at the time
naturally attributing it to the hardships
which he had obviously undergone later
on i had good reason to recall it to mind

  when he had cleared his plate for
the trail of the cloven hoof



the third time i began to put a few ques-
tions

   whats your name

    jake

   jake what the length of the
pause which followed my question
warned me that the answer was likely to
be a lie

   jake thomas smith

   have you any more names i que-
ried sarcastically and to my surprize he
nodded

   the blokes in my platoon call me
crazy jake he informed me solemnly

  i looked hard at him suspecting that
i was being paid back in my own coin
but he went on unconcernedly finishing
up the remaining scraps of food cracking
the bones with his strong teeth the ca-
nines of which were unusually long and
pointed when he licked up every scrap
of gravy off his plate just like a dog i
began to glimpse something of the truth
he was one of those rare examples of
extreme atavism a throw-back to prim-
itive types an unlucky being who had
been cursed with more than his fair share
of the thin streak of animalism which is
the compulsory legacy of the human race
later on when i had the opportunity of
examining him more closely i found that
he was able to exercise those muscles
represented in the normal man as mere
rudimentary survivals which move the
ears his sense of smell was unusually
keen his eyes possessed the power of re-
flecting the light in exactly the same man-
ner as the eyes of certain species of car-
nivores it came as something of a shock
to think that such a man had been accept-
ed for military service but after all there
was nothing wrong with him in a phys-
ical sense on the contrary as is so often
the case with these reversions the man
was exceptionally strong and active and
his peculiar mental traits might well have

passed unnoticed in the perfunctory ex-
amination to which recruits were subject-
ed in the latter days of the war

   by degrees i got his story from him
of course he was a deserter though to do
him bare justice he seemed quite uncon-
scious of the gravity of his offense-or
indeed that he had committed any of-
fense at all he had simply got tired of
his surroundings and the irksome re-
straints on his liberty and had wandered
off his instinct drawing him to the great
open moors living on herbs and roots
and scraps that he could find or steal
until the intense cold had beaten him

   and what do you intend to do i
asked him when he had finished his vague
and rambling tale

  he gave me a vacant stare i dun-
no was the extent of his future plans

    do you know what theyll do to you
if they catch you jake

   make me slope arms by numbers
his accompanying grimace was eloquent
of his distaste for that form of exercise

    theyll do more than that my poor
lad they will shoot you

    me he cried with a sort of simple
wonder shoot me dead

    dead as mutton i had to tell him
 why he demanded in an aggrieved
tone i never hurt em-i never hurt a
fly

    thats just the trouble jake you
became a soldier in order to hurt people
thats what a soldier is for in time of
war-to hurt soldiers wearing another
sort of uniform-or to get hurt by them
i tried to explain the matter as best i
could but after i had finished i very
much doubted whether the enormity of
his offense had penetrated his intelli-
gence not that he was an idiot in the
ordinary sense of the word i classed him
as a mattoid a man whose brain could
not be gaged by comparison with ordinary


weird tales

standards he might be trained and
taught to perform certain tasks much in
the same manner as an intelligent dog
goes through certain tricks more than
that he might be capable of having cer-
tain fixed and elementary ideas instilled
into him by simple repetition for later on
i had good reason to know that he pos-
sessed an unusually retentive memory
but beyond that and as far as original
and self-conscious thought and reasoning
were concerned his mind was an absolute
blank and as i realized the fact i knew
that here was the very servant i had been
praying for-strong willing docile and
no more capable of understanding the
work on which i was engaged than was a
horse or a dog

t sat up late that night watching jake
- sleeping curled up on the floor in
front of the fire debating with myself
whether i should turn him over to the
military authorities or keep him myself
in the end i decided that he would be
serving his country more effectively by
doing the menial work of moor lodge
than by endangering his own life and
the lives of all around him by handling
a loaded rifld and experimenting with
millss bombs in the morning i put the
matter to him and he was only too glad
to stay with me he soon picked up the
routine of his simple duties and for a
time all went well my experiments pro-
ceeded apace i succeeded in isolating
the missing element and gasefying it in a
form that could not be detected when
mingled with the ordinary atmosphere
complete success was within my very
grasp when i was brought up short by an
unexpected and disquieting discovery

  you must understand that i had never
attempted to keep jake confined to the
house-indeed i doubt whether he would
have obeyed me had i forbidden him to

leave it i had provided him with a suit
of clothes such as might be worn by a lad
working on a farm and he was accus-
tomed to spend his hours off duty roam-
ing freely about the moor one evening
he came home at dusk after having been
absent most of the day took off his coat
and began to sweep out the laboratory
where i was still working at first i took
no notice of him but presently i began to
see that he was not giving much attention
to what he was doing every now and
then he would stop sweeping and furtive-
ly take something from his trousers pock-
et glance at it polish it on his sleeve
examine it again and then transfer it to
his pocket and go on sweeping secret-
ly amused i watched his antics for a
while out of the corner of my eye and
when he was admiring the thing for the
umteenth time i purposely made a sud-
den movement jake tried to conceal his
treasure but in his hurry to replace it in
his pocket the thing slipped out of his
hand falling on the stone floor with a
jingle that was unmistakable it was a
brightly polished five-shilling piece

   hullo jake i laughed i didnt
know you were a moneyed man where
did you get that from have you been
robbing a bank or something for i
knew well enough that he had not had
any money when he arrived

  instead of saying that hed found it-
which i quite thought he had-he jibbed
at my question and stood silent his hands
fumbling with the broom-handle while he
shifted his feet uneasily the very picture
of conscious guilt

   where did you get that money
from i repeated more sternly did you
steal it

  he bridled up at that jake is not
a thief he declared looking me full in
the face

   then where did you get it from

                     w t-
the trail of the cloven hoof



    some one give it me he said at
length

    whos the some one

    a man

    what man

    the man that lives in the big house
his evident reluctance to answer only
increased my suspicions that something
was wrong i kept questioning him until
i learnt that the big house was the place
which is now known as the torside pri-
vate sanatorium turning this piece of
information over in my mind i handed
him back his coin and as he dropped it
into his pocket i heard it jingle against
other money

   ah have you got many of those
pretty bits of silver jake i asked care-
lessly pretending to resume my work as
though the matter were of no importance

   he fell into the trap at once he was
unable to count but he proudly held up
the outstretched fingers of one hand

    five eh i commented with forced
geniality he must be a nice kind man
to give away all that money do you
think he might give me some

    not all at once jake explained in-
jaocently he only gives me one at a
time

   oh-ho thought i so he has been at
the big house four times before today
the mystery was deepening

    i think ill have to pay a visit to this
kind gentleman who gives money away
i smiled ive been wanting to meet
some one like that all my life

    youll have to sing first said jake
eyeing me as though doubtful as to my
vocal abilities

    what i cried

   i always have to sing before he
gives me anything

    and what on earth do you sing i
asked utterly bewildered

    songs grunted jake

    w t-

   sing one to me i said struck by a
sudden idea and ill give you another
five shillings

  he needed no further inducement
but immediately put down the broom and
struck up one of the very unofficial
marching tunes that hed learnt in camp
but it wasnt the tune that caused the col-
or to drain away from my face and my
heart to be filled with a sickening horror
-it was the doggerel words which he had
adopted in place of the quasi-french of
the original they were a crude but rec-
ognizable parody of the chemical equation
which represented the composition of my
secret explosive

  in a flash i realized what had hap-
pened underrating the creatures intel-
ligence and forgetting his marvelously
retentive memory i had not troubled to
keep my notes out of sight somebody
had got hold of him and bribed him to
learn them off by heart-and who was
likely to do such a thing except a secret
enemy agent cold sweat broke out on
my forehead as i saw how narrowly irre-
trievable disaster had been averted once
the secret of the gas was in the hands of
the enemy it would be a mere matter of
days-perhaps only hours-before their
immense and well-equipped system of
gas-producing factories would enable
them to wipe out the allied armies en
masse at that time it was known in of-
ficial circles that the german guns were
firing more than fifty per cent of gas and
war-chemical shells besides using their
apparatus for cloud attacks and batteries
of short-range livens projectors was
it likely they would refuse to use this new
and terrible weapon when once it lay
ready to their hands

  steadying myself with an effort i
turned to the innocent cause of all the
trouble

   so that was the song you sang to the


weird tales

nice gentleman at the big house eh did
he seem to think that it was worth the
money

  jake shook his head no he was
angry and said i must have learnt it
wrong he said he wanted to hear the
last song that was in that book and he
pointed to the large note-book in which i
entered the results of my experiments

wave of relief swept over me as i
realized that the fool had not yet
betrayed the secret yet he must now
know the final and ultimate formula for
he had just repeated it to me but the
explanation was not far to seek he had
taken another look at the book and mem-
orized the last formula since he had re-
turned that evening so far my secret
was safe but how long would it remain
so after jake had paid another visit to the
big house

  that visit must be prevented at all
costs but how if he chose to quit the
house that minute i had no power to
stop him how could i ensure the silence
of a creature of such mentality unless i
silenced him for ever for ever i felt
myself trembling as a thought flashed
through my mind as a blinding electric
flash traverses a vacuum tube within the
reach of my arm was a phial containing a
liquid preparation of the deadly formula
so far it had never been tried on a living
organism but here - forced on me by
circumstances over which i had had no
control-was the opportunity to test its
efficiency in a practical manner and at the
same time ensure the silence of the only
man likely to betray it to the enemy

  averting my head lest my very ex-
pression should betray the sinister project
i had in mind i addressed jake when
have you arranged to see the kind gentle-
man again i asked as carelessly as i
could

   tonight after supper he answered
and with those words he sealed his own
fate

  there could be no turning back now
one man must be sacrificed in order that
humanity might be spared a scourge such
as has never fallen on it since the world
was evolved what was one single life
-and such a life-compared with the
millions of clear-minded sentient beings
who would dissolve in smoke and flame
if he were allowed to reach the big house
that night during the hour which
elapsed before supper-time i probed my
soul as i had never probed it before
weighing the matter sifting each argu-
ment for or against as meticulously as
did any judge before assuming the black
cap i shrunk from my task with horror
but i went through with it to the bitter
end

  its actual accomplishment was sim-
plicity itself a few drops of the color-
less liquid poured into the mug of cider
that he always drank at supper and the
thing was done it only remained to get
him well away from the house without
delay

   your friend will be waiting for you
jake i reminded him

   aye so he will he rose and took
up his cap good-night sir

   good-bye jake i answered adding
under my breath and god help you

  i allowed him five minutes start then
hurried on my overcoat and followed
outside the night was dark and forbid-
ding with the sky overcast by a murky
veil of cloud which shrouded the face of
the moon before me stretched the moor
a waste of empty blackness devoid of
even a film of low-lying mist to denote
the winding combes which ran between
the rocky tors as i made my way along
the well-defined track i seemed to be
walking through an infinity of shadows
the trail of the cloven hoof



the only sounds which broke the eery
stillness were the slight crunching of the
gravel beneath my hurrying footsteps and
the far-off mournful cries of a flock of
wandering sea-gulls

  when the slope of the ground told
me that i had passed the brow of the
ridge i glanced at the illuminated dial
of my watch and saw that twenty minutes
had elapsed since i had administered the
drug to jake this told me little for i
had not the slightest idea how long the
stuff would take to work i walked more
slowly down the slope and only quick-
ened my pace to mount the farther side
of the combe in order to get a view of
the path ahead not that i could see
anything in that pall of darkness as yet
but i wanted to have an uninterrupted
view of what was about to happen of
course i had not caught sight of jake
since quitting the house but i knew that
the path i had followed was the only
means of his reaching the big house
somewhere in the darkness ahead he
must be hurrying along his poor brain
filled with childish delight at the pros-
pect of soon possessing another big shin-
ing coin as blissfully unconscious of his
impending fate as are the microscopic in-
fusoria before the drop of sterilizing
solution wipes them out of existence

at last i reached the summit of the
xtl high tor from which i knew i
could command a view almost to the
gates of the house for which jake was
making i paused and glanced at my
watch again i started when i saw that a
full hour had elapsed without anything
happening had the experiment failed
was the whole thing nothing but an
empty impracticable dream had my
days and nights of labor been wasted in a
quest as useless and futile as those of the
madman who strove to square the circle

or evolve a system of perpetual motion
throwing aside all caution in my desire
to know what had happened i pressed
onward almost at a run nor did i
pause or slacken speed when my onward
progress brought into sight a single pin-
point of light telling me that the inmates
of the sanatorium were awake and stir-
ring

   then slowly but inexorably the con-
viction was forced on me that my experi-
ment had failed-that though theoret-
ically flawless it had proved useless when
subjected to the acid test of practise-and
i can truthfully say that my first emotion
was a feeling of profound relief

   thank god the formula is harm-
less i cried and laughed aloud in the
darkness let him tell the spy the secret
-and much good may it do him i have
failed-but again i thank god and am
content at least humanity has been
spared the menace of-

  coming from a spot barely a hundred
yards ahead a flash of blood-red fire
stabbed the night and the fraction of a
second later a dull muffled concussion
smote my ears it was the death-knell of
crazy jake-that was my one conscious
thought as i stood stunned by the awful
manner in which my theory had been
proved it was some minutes before i
could pull myself together

  prudence warned me to leave the
spot as soon as possible for it was but a
short distance to the spys house and he
could not have failed to hear the explo-
sion yet a horrible fascination an ir-
resistible desire to lock upon my fell
handiwork drew me onward as a mag-
net draws a needle almost before i was
aware of what i was doing-the danger
i was courting in risking being seen near
the spot-i found myself running for-
ward my eyes following the dancing


weird tales

beam of my flashlight as it searched the
ground

  i will not harrow your feelings by de-
scribing the sight which finally met my
eyes sufficient to say that the explosion
had expended its force downward in pre-
cisely the same manner as dynamite does
the whole of the lower portion of his
body had been blown to atoms but the
upper part of his chest his arms and
head were comparatively uninjured one
look was enough-more than enough i
snapped off my flashlight and fled   

ou can well imagine the eagerness
with which i scanned the first
newspapers i could get hold of but
there was no account in the morning pa-
per of a mutilated body being found nor
in the next mornings nor the next as
the days lengthened into weeks without
a single hint of the tragedy my relief
gave place to wonder and finally to a
vague nameless fear had i not seen
the uninjured half of jakes body lying
in the roadway i should have dismissed
the matter with the assumption that it
had been completely destroyed by the ex-
plosion but the moor is not so utterly
deserted that such an object could remain
unnoticed in the public highway for any
length of time it must have been re-
moved on the same night when the trag-
edy occurred but by whom and for
what purpose but as the months went
by without a single hint or rumor of the
affair being brought to light i could only
come to the conclusion-a fantastic one
maybe but the only theory that would

explain the facts-that the remains had
been carried off and devoured by some
prowling animal gradually my fears
became lulled into a sense of security
whether his remains were above ground
or below crazy jake was dead and un-
recognizable by this time i argued with
myself and his secret had perished with
him my fears slept so soundly that the
rude shock of their awakening almost un-
settled my reason

  it happened like this it was a night
in winter six months almost to the very
day after the affair that i have just de-
scribed it was intensely cold and the
snow which had fallen heavily through-
out the day lay thick upon the ground
but i was cozy enough sitting in my
easy-chair in front of a roaring fire in the
library of moor lodge with my pipe
alight and a recently published scientific
volume on my lap my wife had retired
early in consequence of a slight chill and
i was alone

  a faint fumbling sound at the win-
dow made me glance up though there
was nothing more in my mind than a
mere idle curiosity as to the origin of the
sound but the moment i rested my eyes
on the casement i felt my limbs grow stiff
with stark paralyzing terror

  gazing fixedly at me through the
glass his face and figure clear and unmis-
takable in the bright rays of the moon
was crazy fake-the man whom i had last
seen a hideously maimed corpse blown
literally in halves by the terrible fuhnina-
tor whose secret he had been about to be-

weird tales

ihave been here exactly a week and if
there is a friendly soul in this miser-
able little town he has escaped my notice
although the tradespeople accept my
money with flattering eagerness they
studiously avoid even the most casual con-
versation i am afraid i can never culti-
vate their society unless i can arrange to
have my ancestors recognized as local res-
idents for the last hundred and fifty years

  despite the coolness of my reception i
have been frequently venturing abroad
in the back of my mind i have cherished
hopes that i might encounter the pale man
in no  incidentally i wonder why
he has moved from no  there is
certainly little advantage in coming only
one room nearer to the front i noticed
the change yesterday when i saw him
coming out of his new room

  we nodded again and this time i
thought i detected a certain malign satis-
faction in his somber black eyes he
must know that i am eager to make his
acquaintance yet his manner forbids over-
tures if he wants to make me go all the
way he can go to the devil i am not the
sort to run after anybody indeed the
surly diffidence of the room clerk has been
enough to prevent me from questioning
him about his mysterious guest

i wonder where the pale man takes his
meals i have been absenting myself
from the hotel restaurant and patronizing
the restaurants outside at each i have
ventured inquiries about the man in no
 no one at any restaurant remem-
bered his having been there perhaps he
has entree into the brahmin homes of
this town and again he may have
found a boarding-house i shall have to
learn if there be one

  the pale man must be difficult to
please for he has again changed his
room i am baffled by his conduct if

he is so desirous of locating himself more
conveniently in the hotel why does he not
move to no  which is the nearest
available room to the front

  perhaps i can make his inability to lo-
cate himself permanently an excuse for
starting a conversation i see we are
closer neighbors now i might casually
say but that is too banal i must await
a better opportunity

e has done it again he is now oc-
cupying no - i am intrigued
by his little game i waste hours trying
to fathom its point what possible mo-
tive could he have i should think he
would get on the hotel peoples nerves
i wonder what our combination bellhop-
chambermaid thinks of having to pre-
pare four rooms for a single guest if he
were not stone-deaf i would ask him at
present i feel too exhausted to attempt
such an enervating conversation

  i am tremendously interested in the
pale mans next move he must either
skip a room or remain where he is for a
permanent guest a very old lady occupies
no  she has not budged from her
room since i have been here and i im-
agine that she does not intend to

  i wonder what the pale man will do i
await his decision with the nervous excite-
ment of a devotee of the track on the eve
of a big race after all i have so little
diversion

well the mysterious guest was not
forced to remain where he was nor
did he have to skip a room the lady in
no  simplified matters by convenient-
ly dying no one knows the cause of her
death but it is generally attributed to old
age she was buried this morning i was
among the curious few who attended her
funeral when i returned home from
the mortuary i was in time to see the pale
the pale man



man leaving her room already he has
moved in

  he favored me with a smile whose
meaning i have tried in vain to decipher
i can not but believe that he meant it to
have some significance he acted as if
there were between us some secret that i
failed to appreciate but then perhaps
his smile was meaningless after all and
only ambiguous by chance like that of
the mona lisa

my man of mystery now resides in
no  and i am not the least
surprized i would have been astonished
if he had not made his scheduled move
i have almost given up trying to under-
stand his eccentric conduct i do not
know a single thing more about him than
i knew the day he arrived i wonder
whence he came there is something in-
definably foreign about his manner i am
curious to hear his voice i like to im-
agine that he speaks the exotic tongue of
some far-away country if only i could
somehow inveigle him into conversation
i wish that i were possessed of the glib
assurance of a college boy who can ad-
dress himself to the most distinguished
celebrity without batting an eye it is no
wonder that i am only an assistant profes-
sor

am worried this morning i awoke to
find myself lying prone upon the
floor i was fully clothed i must have
fallen exhausted there after i returned to
my room last night

  i wonder if my condition is more seri-
ous than i had suspected until now i
have been inclined to discount the fears
of those who have pulled a long face
about me for the first time i recall the
prolonged hand-clasp of the president
when he bade me good-bye fromthe uni-

versity obviously he never expected to
see me alive again

  of course i am not that unwell nev-
ertheless i must be more careful thank
heaven i have no dependents to worry
about i have not even a wife for i was
never willing to exchange the loneliness
of a bachelor for the loneliness of a hus-
band

  i can say in all sincerity that the pros-
pect of death does not frighten me spec-
ulation about life beyond the grave has
always bored me whatever it is or is
not ill try to get along

  i have been so preoccupied about the
sudden turn of my own affairs that i have
neglected to make note of a most ex-
traordinary incident the pale man has
done an astounding thing he has
skipped three rooms and moved all the
way to no  we are now very close
neighbors we shall meet oftener and
my chances for making his acquaintance
are now greater

i have confined myself to my bed dur-
ing the last few days and have had my
food brought to me i even called a local
doctor whom i suspect to be a quack he
looked me over with professional indiffer-
ence and told me not to leave my room
for some reason he does not want me to
climb stairs for this bit of information
he received a ten-dollar bill which as i
directed him he fished out of my coat
pocket a pickpocket could not have
done it better

  he had not been gone long when i
was visited by the room clerk that
worthy suggested with a great show of
kindly concern that i use the facilities of
the local hospital it was so modern and
all that with more firmness than i have
been able to muster in a long time i gave
him to understand that i intended to re-
main where i am frowning sullenly he
 

weird tales

stiffly retired the doctor must have
paused long enough downstairs to tell
him a pretty story it is obvious that he
is afraid i shall die in his best room

  the pale man is up to his old tricks
last night when i tottered down the hall
the door of no  was ajar without
thinking i looked inside the pale man
sat in a rocking-chair idly smoking a cig-
arette he looked up into my eyes and
smiled that peculiar ambiguous smile
that has so deeply puzzled me i moved
on down the corridor not so much mysti-
fied as annoyed the whole mystery of
the mans conduct is beginning to irk me
it is all so inane so utterly lacking in
motive

  i feel that i shall never meet the pale
man but at least i am going to learn
his identity tomorrow i shall ask for
the room clerk and deliberately interro-
gate him

i know now i know the identity of the
pale man and i know the meaning of
his smile

  early this afternoon i summoned the
room clerk to my bedside

  please tell me i asked abruptly
who is the man in no 

  the clerk stared wearily and uncom-
prehendingly

  you must be mistaken that room
is unoccupied

  oh but it is i snapped in irritation
i myself saw the man there only two
nights ago he is a tall handsome fel-
low with dark eyes and hair he is un-
usually pale he checked in the day that
i arrived

  the hotel man regarded me dubiously
as if i were trying to impose upon him

  but i assure you there is no such per-
son in the house as for his checking in
when you did you were the only guest
we registered that day

  what why ive seen him twenty
times first he had no  at the end
of the corridor then he kept moving
toward the front now hes next door in
no 

  the room clerk threw up his hands
youre crazy he exclaimed and i
saw that he meant what he said

  i shut up at once and dismissed him
after he had gone i heard him rattling
the knob of the pale mans door there
is no doubt that he believes the room to
be empty

  thus it is that i can now understand
the events of the past few weeks i now
comprehend the significance of the death
in no  i even feel partly respon-
sible for the old ladys passing after
all i brought the pale man with me but
it was not i who fixed his path why he
chose to approach me room after room
through the length of this dreary hotel
why his path crossed the threshold of the
woman in no  those mysteries i
can not explain

  i suppose i should have guessed his
identity when he skipped the three rooms
the night i fell unconscious upon the
floor in a single night of triumph he
advanced until he was almost to my door

  he will be coming by and by to inhabit
this room his ultimate goal when he
comes i shall at least be able to return
his smile of grim recognition

  meanwhile i have only to wait beyond
my bolted door

    

the door swings slowly open

oming of abel behenna

       by bram stoker

the little comish port of pencastle
was bright in the early april
when the sun had seemingly come
to stay after a long and bitter winter
boldly and blackly the rock stood out
against a background of shaded blue
where the sky fading into mist met the
far horizon the sea was of true cornish
hue-sapphire save where it became
deep emerald green in the fathomless
depths under the cliffs where the seal
caves opened their grim jaws on the
slopes the grass was parched and brown
the spikes of furze bushes were ashy
gray but the golden yellow of their flow-
ers streamed along the hillside dipping
out in lines as the rock cropped up and
lessening into patches and dots till finally
it died away altogether where the sea
winds swept round the jutting cliffs and
cut short the vegetation as though with
an ever-working aerial shears the whole
hillside with its body of brown and
flashes of yellow was like a colossal yel-
low-hammer

the little harbor opened from the sea
between towering cliffs and behind a

lonely rock pierced with many caves and
blow-holes through which the sea in
storm time sent its thunderous voice to-
gether with a fountain of drifting spume
hence it wound westward in a serpentine
course guarded at its entrance by two
little curving piers to left and right
these were roughly built of dark slates
placed endways and held together with
great beams bound with iron bands
thence it flowed up the rocky bed of the
stream whose winter torrents had of old
cut out its way amongst the hills this
stream was deep at first with here and
there where it widened patches of bro-
ken rock exposed at low water full of
holes where crabs and lobsters were to be
found at the ebb of the tide from
among the rocks rose sturdy posts used
for warping in the little coasting-vessels
which frequented the port higher up
the stream still flowed deeply for the tide
ran far inland but always calmly for all
the force of the wildest storm was broken
below

some quarter-mile inland the stream
was deep at high water but at low tide

                                    


weird tales

there were at each side patches of the
same broken rock as lower down through
the chinks of which the sweet water of
the natural stream trickled and murmured
after the tide had ebbed away here too
rose mooring-posts for the fishermens
boats at either side of the river was a
row of cottages down almost on the level
of high tide they were pretty cottages
strongly and snugly built with trim nar-
row gardens in front full of old-fash-
ioned plants flowering currants colored
primroses wallflowers and stonecrops
over the fronts of many of them climbed
clematis and wisteria the window-sides
and door-posts of all were as white as
snow and the little pathway to each was
paved with light-colored stones at some
of the doors were tiny porches whilst at
others were rustic seats cut from tree
trunks or from old barrels in nearly every
case the window-ledges were filled with
boxes or pots of flowers or foliage plants

  two men lived in cottages exactly op-
posite each other across the stream two
men both young both good-looking
both prosperous and who had been com-
panions and rivals from their boyhood
abel behenna was dark with the gipsy
darkness which the phenician mining
wanderers left in their track eric sanson
-which the local antiquarian said was a
corruption of sagamanson - was fair
with the ruddy hue which marked the
path of the wild norseman these two
seemed to have singled out each other
from the very beginning to work and
strive together to fight for each other and
to stand back to back in all endeavors
they had now put the coping-stone on
their temple of unity by falling in love
with the same girl

  sarah trefusis was certainly the pret-
tiest girl in pencastle and there was many
a young man who would gladly have tried
his fortune with her but that there were

two to contend against and each of these
the strongest and most resolute man in
the port-except the other the average
young man thought that this was very
hard and on account of it bore no good
will to either of the three principals
whilst the average young woman who
had lest worse should befall to put up
with the grumbling of her sweetheart
and the sense of being only second best
which it implied did not either be sure
regard sarah with friendly eye

  thus it came in the course of a year or
so for rustic courtship is a slow process
that the two men and the woman found
themselves thrown much together they
were all satisfied so it did not matter and
sarah who was vain and somewhat friv-
olous took care to have her revenge on
both men and women in a quiet way
when a young woman in her walking
out can only boast one not-quite-satisfied
young man it is no particular pleasure to
her to see her escort cast sheeps eyes at a
better-looking girl supported by two de-
voted swains

  at length there came a time which
sarah dreaded and which she had tried
to keep distant-the time when she had
to make her choice between the two men
she liked them both and indeed either
of them might have satisfied the ideas of
even a more exacting girl but her mind
was so constituted that she thought more
of what she might lose than of what she
might gain and whenever she thought
she had made up her mind she became in-
stantly assailed with doubts as to the wis-
dom of her choice always the man
whom she had presumably lost became
endowed afresh with a newer and more
bountiful crop of advantages than had
ever arisen from the possibility of his ac-
ceptance she promised each man that
on her birthday she would give him his
answer and that day had now arrived
the coming of abel behenna



  the promises had been given singly
and confidentially but each was given to
a man who was not likely to forget early
in the morning she found both men hov-
ering round her door neither had taken
the other into his confidence and each
was simply seeking an early opportunity
of getting his answer and advancing his
suit if necessary damon as a rule does
not take pythias with him when making
a proposal and in the heart of each man
his own affairs had a claim far above any
requirements of friendship so through-
out the day they kept seeing each other
out the position was doubtless some-
what embarrassing to sarah and though
the satisfaction of her vanity that she
should be thus adored was very pleasing
yet there were moments when she was an-
noyed with both men for being so per-
sistent her only consolation at such
moments was that she saw through the
elaborate smiles of the other girls when
in passing they noticed her door thus
doubly guarded the jealousy which filled
their hearts

  sarahs mother was a person of com-
monplace and sordid ideas and seeing
all along the state of affairs her one in-
tention persistently expressed to her
daughter in the plainest of words was to
so arrange matters that sarah should get
all that was possible out of both men
with this purpose she had cunningly kept
herself as far as possible in the back-
ground in the matter of her daughters
wooings and watched in silence at first
sarah had been indignant with her for
her sordid views but as usual her weak
nature gave way before persistence and
she had now got to the stage of passive
acceptance she was not surprized when
her mother whispered to her in the little
yard behind the house

  go up the hillside for a while i want
to talk to these two theyre both red-

hot for ye and nows the time to get
things fixed

  sarah began a feeble remonstrance but
her mother cut her short

  i tell ye girl that my mind is made
up both these men want ye and only
one can have ye but before ye choose
itll be so arranged that yell have all
that both have got dont argy child
go up the hillside and when ye come
back ill have it fixed-i see a way quite

    i 

    t

so sarah went up the hillside through
the narrow paths between the golden
furze and mrs trefusis joined the two
men in the living-room of the little house

  she opened the attack with the desper-
ate courage which is in all mothers when
they think for their children howsoever
mean the thoughts may be

  ye two men yere both in love with
my sarah

  their bashful silence gave consent to
the barefaced proposition she went on
neither of ye has much

  again they tacitly acquiesced in the
soft impeachment

  i dont know that either of ye could
keep a wife

   though neither said a vord their looks
and bearing expressed distinct dissent
mrs trefusis went on

  but if yed put what ye both have to-
gether yed make a comfortable home for
one of ye-and sarah

  she eyed the men keenly with her cun-
ning eyes half shut as she spoke then
satisfied from her scrutiny that the idea
vas accepted she went on quickly as if
to prevent argument

  the girl likes ye both and mayhap
its hard for her to choose why dont
ye toss up for her first put your money
together-yeve each got a bit put by i
know let the lucky man take the lot and


weird tales

trade with it a bit and then come home
and marry her neither of yes afraid i
suppose and neither of yell say that he
wont do that much for the girl that ye
both say ye love

  abel broke the silence

  it dont seem the square thing to toss
for the girl she wouldnt like it herself
and it doesnt seem respectful-like to
her-

  eric interrupted he was conscious
that his chance was not so good as abels
in case sarah should wish to choose be-
tween them

  are ye afraid of the hazard

  not me said abel boldly

  mrs trefusis seeing that her idea was
beginning to work followed up the ad-
vantage

  it is settled that ye put yer money
together to make a home for her whether
ye toss for her or leave it for her to
choose

  yes said eric quickly and abel
agreed with equal sturdiness

  mrs trefusis little cunning eyes twin-
kled she heard sarahs step in the yard
and said

  well here she comes and i leave it
to her and she went out

during her brief walk on the hillside
sarah had been trying to make up
her mind she was feeling almost angry
with both men for being the cause of her
difficulty and as she came into the room
said shortly

  i want to have a word with you both
-come to the flagstaff rock where we
can be alone

  she took her hat and went out of the
house up the winding path to the steep
rock crowned with a high flagstaff where
once the wreckers fire-basket used to
burn this was the rock which formed
the northern jaw of the little harbor

there was only room on the path for two
abreast and it marked the state of things
pretty well when by a sort of implied
arrangement sarah went first and the
two men followed walking abreast and
keeping step by this time each mans
heart was boiling with jealousy when
they came to the top of the rock sarah
stood against the flagstaff and the two
young men stood opposite her she had
chosen her position with knowledge and
intention for there was no room for any
one to stand beside her they were all
silent for a while then sarah began to
laugh and said

  i promised the both of you to give
you an answer today ive been thinking
and thinking and thinking till i began to
get angry with you both for plaguing me
so and even now i dont seem any nearer
than ever i was to making up my mind

  eric said suddenly let us toss for it
lass

  sarah showed no indignation whatever
at the proposition her mothers eternal
suggestion had schooled her to the accept-
ance of something of the kind and her
weak nature made it easy to her to grasp
at any way out of the difficulty she stood
with downcast eyes idly picking at the
sleeve of her dress seeming to have tacit-
ly acquiesced in the proposal both men
instinctively realizing this pulled each a
coin from his pocket spun it in the air
and dropped his other hand over the
palm on which it lay for a few seconds
they remained thus all silent then abel
who was the more thoughtful of the men
spoke

  sarah is this good

  as he spoke he removed the upper
hand from the coin and placed the latter
back in his pocket sarah was nettled

  good or bad its good enough for
me take it or leave it as you like she
said to which he replied quickly
toe coming of abel behenna



  nay lass aught that concerns you
is good enow for me i did but think of
you lest you might have pain or disap-
pointment hereafter if you love eric
better nor me in gods name say so and
i think im man enow to stand aside
likewise if im the one dont make us
both miserable for life

  face to face with a difficulty sarahs
weak nature proclaimed itself she put
her hands before her face and began to
cry saying

  it was my mother she keeps telling
me

  the silence which followed was broken
by eric who said hotly to abel

  let the lass alone cant you if she
wants to choose this way let her its
good enough for me-and for you too
shes said it now and must abide by it
hereupon sarah turned upon him in
sudden fury and cried

  hold your tongue what is it to you
at any rate and she resumed her crying

  eric was so flabbergasted that he had not
a word to say but stood looking foolish
with his mouth open and his hands held
out with the coin still between them all
were silent till sarah taking her hands
from her face laughed hysterically and
said

  as you two cant make up your minds
im going home and she turned to go

  stop said abel in an authoritative
voice eric you hold the coin and ill
cry now before we settle it let us
clearly understand the man who wins
takes all the money that we both have
got brings it to bristol and ships on a
voyage and trades with it then he
comes back and marries sarah and they
two keep all whatever there may be as
the result of the trading is this what we
understand

  yes said eric

  ill marry him on my next birthday

said sarah having said it the intoler-
ably mercenary spirit of her action
seemed to strike her and impulsively she
turned away with a bright blush fire
seemed to sparkle in the eyes of both the
men

  said eric a year so be the man
that wins is to have one year

  toss cried abel and the coin spun
in the air eric caught it and again held
it between his outstretched hands

  heads cried abel a pallor sweep-
ing over his face as he spoke

  as he leaned forward to look sarah
leaned forward too and their heads al-
most touched he could feel her hair blow-
ing on his cheek and it thrilled through
him like fire eric lifted his upper hand
the coin lay with its head up abel stepped
forward and took sarah in his arms
with a curse eric hurled the coin far into
the sea then he leaned against the flag-
staff and scowled at the others with his
hands thrust deep in his pockets abel
whispered wild words of passion and de-
light into sarahs ears and as she listened
she began to believe that fortune had
rightly interpreted the wishes of her se-
cret heart and that she loved abel best

presently abel looked up and caught
sight of erics face as the last ray of
sunset struck it the red light intensified
the natural ruddiness of his complexion
and he looked as though he were steeped
in blood abel did not mind his scowl
for now that his own heart was at rest he
could feel unalloyed pity for his friend
he stepped over meaning to comfort
him and held out his hand saying

  it was my chance old lad dont
grudge it me ill try to make sarah a
happy woman and you shall be a brother
to us both

  brother be damned was all the
answer eric made as he turned away


iweird tales

  when he had gone a few steps down
the rocky path he turned and came back
standing before abel and sarah who had
their arms round each other he said

  you have a year make the most of
it and be sure youre in time to claim
your wife be back to have your bans up
in time to be married on the th of
april if youre not i tell you i shall
have my bans up and you may get back
too late

  what do you mean eric you are

mad

  no more mad than you are abel be-
henna you go thats your chance i
stay thats mine i dont mean to let the
grass grow under my feet sarah cared
no more for you than for me five minutes
ago and she may come back to that five
minutes after youre gone you won by
a point only-the game may change
the game wont change said abel
shortly sarah youll be true to me
you wont marry till i return

  for a year added eric quickly
thats the bargain

  i promise for the year said sarah
a dark look came over abels face and
he was about to speak but he mastered
himself and smiled

  i mustnt be too hard or get angry
tonight come eric we played and
fought together i won fairly i played
fairly all the game of our wooing you
know that as vell as i do and now when
i am going away i shall look to my old
and true comrade to help me when i am
gone

  ill help you none said eric so
help me god

  it was god helped me said abel
simply

  then let him go on helping you
said eric angrily the devil is good
enough for me and without another

word he rushed down the steep path and
disappeared behind the rocks

  when he had gone abel hoped for
some tender passage with sarah but the
first remark she made chilled him

  how lonely it all seems without eric
and this note sounded till he had left her
at home-and after

  early on the next morning abel heard
a noise at his door and on going out saw
eric walking rapidly away a small can-
vas bag full of gold and silver lay on the
threshold on a small slip of paper pinned
to it was written

  take the money and go i stay god for you
the devil for me remember the th of april

eric sanson

  that afternoon abel went off to bris-
tol and a week later sailed on the star
of the sea bound for pahang his money
-including that which had been erics
-was on board in the shape of a venture
of cheap toys he had been advised by a
shrewd old mariner of bristol whom he
knew and who knew the ways of the
chersonese who predicted that every
penny invested would be returned with a
shilling to boot

as the year wore on sarah became
- more and more disturbed in her
mind eric was always at hand to make
love to her in his own persistent master-
ful manner and to this she did not object
only one letter came from abel to say
that his venture had proved successful
and that he had sent some two hundred
pounds to the bank at bristol and was
trading with fifty pounds still remaining
in goods for china whither the star of
the sea was bound and whence she would
return to bristol he suggested that
erics share of the venture should be re-
turned to him with his share of the prof-
its this proposition was treated with
the coming of abel behenna



anger by eric and as simply childish by
sarahs mother

  more than six months had since then
elapsed bat no other letter had come and
erics hopes which had been dashed down
by the letter from pahang began to rise
again he perpetually assailed sarah with
an if if abel did not return would
she then marry him if the th of april
went by without abel being in the port
would she give him over if abel had
taken his fortune and married another
girl on the head of it would she marry
him eric as soon as the truth were
known and so on in an endless variety
of possibilities

  the power of the strong will and the
determined purpose over the womans
weaker nature became in time manifest
sarah began to lose her faith in abel and
to regard eric as a possible husband and
a possible husband is in a womans eye
different from all other men a new af-
fection for him began to arise in her
breast and the daily familiarities of per-
mitted courtship furthered the growing
affection sarah began to regard abel as
rather a rock in the road of her life and
had it not been for her mothers constant-
ly reminding her of the good fortune
already laid by in the bristol bank she
would have tried to shut her eyes alto-
gether to the fact of abels existence

  the th of april was saturday so
that in order to have the marriage on that
day it would be necessary that the bans
should be called on sunday the nd of
march from the beginning of that
month eric kept perpetually on the sub-
ject of abels absence and his outspoken
opinion that the latter was either dead or
married began to become a reality to the
womans mind as the first half of the
month wore on eric became more jubi-
lant and after church on the th he took
sarah for a walk to the flagstaff rock

  there he asserted himself strongly
i told abel and you too that if he
was not here to put up his bans in time
for the eleventh i would put up mine for
the twelfth now the time has come
when i mean to do it he hasnt kept

his word-

  here sarah struck in out of her weak-
ness and indecision he hasnt broken
it yet

  eric ground his teeth with anger if
you mean to stick up for him he said
as he smote his hands savagely on the
flagstaff which sent forth a shivering
murmur well and good ill keep my
part of the bargain on sunday i shall
give notice of the bans and you can deny
them in the church if you will if abel
is in pencastle on the eleventh he can
have them canceled and his own put up
but till then i take my course and wo to
any one who stands in my way

  with that he flung himself down the
rocky pathway and sarah could not but
admire his viking strength and spirit as
crossing the hill he strode away along the
cliffs toward bude

  during the week no news was heard of
abel and on saturday eric gave notice of
the bjns of marriage between himself and
sarah trefusis the clergyman would
have remonstrated with him for although
nothing formal had been told to the
neighbors it had been understood since
abels departure that on his return he was
to marry sarah but eric would not dis-
cuss the question

  it is a painful subject sir he said
with a firmness which the parson who
was a very young man could not but be
swayed by surely there is nothing
against sarah or me why should there
be any bones made about the matter
the parson said no more and on the
next day he read out the bans for the first
time amidst an audible buzz from the


weird tales

congregation sarah was present con-
trary to custom and though she blushed
furiously enjoyed her triumph over the
other girls whose bans had not yet come

  before the week was over she began to
make her wedding dress eric used to
come and look at her at work and the
sight thrilled through him he used to
say all sorts of pretty things to her at such
times and there were to both delicious
moments of love-making

  the bams were read a second time on
the th and erics hope grew more and
more fixed though there were to him
moments of acute despair when he re-
alized that the cup of happiness might be
dashed from his lips at any moment right
up to the last at such times he was full
of passion-desperate and remorseless-
and he ground his teeth and clenched his
hands in a wild way as though some taint
of the berserker fury of his ancestors still
lingered in his blood on the thursday
of that week he looked in on sarah and
found her amid a flood of sunshine put-
ting finishing touches to her white wed-
ding gown his own heart was full of
gayety and the sight of the woman who
was so soon to be his own so occupied
filled him with a joy unspeakable and he
felt faint with a languorous ecstasy
bending over he kissed sarah on the
mouth and then whispered in her rosy
ear

  your wedding dress sarah and for
me

  as he drew back to admire her she
looked up saucily and said to him per-
haps not for you there is more than a
week yet for abel and then cried out
in dismay for with a wild gesture and a
fierce oath eric dashed out of the house
banging the door behind him

  the incident disturbed sarah more
than she could have thought possible for
it awoke all her fears and doubts and in-

decision afresh she cried a little and
put by her dress and to soothe herself
went out to sit for a while on the sum-
mit of the flagstaff rock when she
arrived she found there a little group
anxiously discussing the weather the
sea was calm and the sun bright but
across the sea were strange lines of dark-
ness and light and close in to shore the
rocks were fringed with foam which
spread out in great white curves and cir-
cles as the currents drifted the wind
had backed and came in sharp cold
puffs the blow-hole which ran under
the flagstaff rock from the rocky bay
without to the harbor within was boom-
ing at intervals and the sea-gulls were
screaming ceaselessly as they wheeled
about the entrance of the port

   it looks bad she heard an old fisher-
man say to the coast guard i seen it
just like this once before when the east
indiaman coromandel went to pieces in
dizzard bay

   sarah did not wait to hear more she
was of a timid nature where danger was
concerned and could not bear to hear of
wrecks and disasters she went home
and resumed the completion of her dress
secretly determined to appease eric when
she should meet him with a sweet apol-
ogy-and to take the earliest opportunity
of being even with him after her mar-
riage

the old fishermans weather prophecy
was justified that night at dusk a
wild storm came on the sea rose and
lashed the western coasts of skye to scilly
and left a tale of disaster everywhere
the sailors and fishermen of pencastle all
turned out on the rocks and cliffs and
watched eagerly presently by a flash of
lightning a ketch vas seen drifting under
only a jib about half a mile outside the
port all eyes and all glasses were concen-

                    w t-
the coming of abel behenna



trated on her waiting for the next flash
and when it came a chorus went up that it
was the lovely alice trading between
bristol and penzance and touching at all
the little ports between god help them
said the harbormaster for nothing in
this world can save them when they are
between bude and tintagel and the wind
on shore

  the coast guards exerted themselves
and aided by brave hearts and willing
hands they brought the rocket apparatus
up on the summit of the flagstaff rock
then they burned blue lights so that
those on board might see the harbor open-
ing in case they could make any effort to
reach it they worked gallantly enough
on board but no skill or strength of man
could avail before many minutes wfere
over the lovely alice rushed to her doom
on the great island rock that guarded the
mouth of the port the screams of those
on board were fairly borne on the tem-
pest as they flung themselves into the sea
in a last chance for life the blue lights
were kept burning and eager eyes peered
into the depths of the waters in case any
face could be seen and ropes were held
ready to fling out in aid but never a
face was seen and the willing arms rested
idle

  eric was there amongst his fellows
his old icelandic origin was never more
apparent than in that wild hour he took
a rope and shouted in the ear of the har-
bor-master

  i shall go down on the rock over the
seal cave the tide is running up and
some one may drift in there

  keep back man came the answer
are you mad one slip on that rock
and you are lost and no man could keep
his feet in the dark on such a place in
such a tempest

  not a bit came the reply you
remember how abel behenna saved me
w t-

there on a night like this when my boat
went on the gull rock he dragged me
up from the deep water in the seal cave
and now some one may drift in there
again as i did and he was gone into the
darkness

  the projecting rock hid the light on
the flagstaff rock but he knew his way
too well to miss it his boldness and
sureness of foot standing to him he short-
ly stood on the great round-topped rock
cut away beneath by the action of the
waves over the entrance of the seal cave
where the water was fathomless there
he stood in comparative safety for the
concave shape of the rock beat back the
waves with their own force and though
the water below him seemed to boil like
a seething cauldron just beyond the spot
there was a space of almost calm the
rock too seemed here to shut off the
sound of the gale and he listened as well
as watched as he stood there ready
with his coil of rope poised to throw he
thought he heard below him just beyond
the whirl of the water a faint despairing
cry he echoed it with a shout that rang
out into the night then he waited for the
flash of lightning and as it passed flung
his rope out into the darkness where he
had seen a face rising through the swirl
of the foam the rope was caught for
he felt a pull on it and he shouted again
in his mighty voice

  tie it round your waist and i shall
pull you up

  then when he felt that it was fast he
moved along the rock to the far side of
the seal cave where the deep water was
something stiller and where he could get
foothold secure enough to drag the res-
cued man on the overhanging rock he
began to pull and shortly he knew from
the rope taken in that the man he was
now rescuing must soon be close to the
top of the rock he steadied himself for


weird tales

a moment and drew a long breath that
he might at the next effort complete the
rescue he had just bent his back to the
work when a flash of lightning revealed
to each other the two men-the rescuer
and the rescued

  eric sanson and abel behenna were
face to face and none knew of the meet-
ing save themselves-and god

  on the instant a wave of passion swept
through erics heart all his hopes were
shattered and with the hatred of cain his
eyes looked out he saw in the instant
of recognition the joy in abels face that
his was the hand to succor him and this
intensified his hate whilst the passion
was on him he started back and the rope
ran out between his hands his moment
of hate was followed by an impulse of his
better manhood but it was too late

  before he could recover himself abel
encumbered with the rope that should
have aided him was plunged with a de-
spairing cry back into the darkness of the
devouring sea

  then feeling all the madness and the
doom of cain upon him eric rushed back
over the rocks heedless of the danger
and eager only for one thing-to be
amongst other people whose living noises
would shut out that last cry which seemed
to ring still in his ears when he re-
gained the flagstaff rock the men sur-
rounded him and through the fury of
the storm he heard the harbor-master say

  we feared you were lost when we
heard a cry how white you are where
is your rope was there any one drifted
in

  no one he shouted in answer for
he felt that he could never explain that
he had let his old comrade slip back into
the sea and at the very place and under
the very circumstances in which that com-
rade had saved his own life he hoped
by one bold lie to set the matter at rest

for ever there was no one to bear wit-
ness-and if he should have to carry that
still white face in his eyes and that de-
spairing cry in his ears for evermore at
least none should know of it no one
he cried more loudly still i slipped on
the rock and the rope fell into the sea
so saying he left them and rushing
down the steep path gained his own cot-
tage and locked himself within

  the remainder of that night he passed
lying on his bed-dressed and motionless
-staring upward and seeming to see
through the darkness a pale face gleam-
ing wet in the lightning with its glad
recognition turning to ghastly despair
and to hear a cry which never ceased to
echo in his soul

  in the morning the storm was over and
all was smiling again except that the sea
was still boisterous with its unspent fury
great pieces of wreck drifted into the
port and the sea around the island rock
was strewn with others two bodies also
drifted into the harbor-one the master
of the wrecked ketch the other a strange
seaman whom no one knew

sarah saw nothing of eric till the eve-
ning and then he only looked in for
a minute he did not come into the
house but simply put his head in through
the open window

  well sarah he called out in a loud
voice though to her it did not ring truly
is the wedding dress done sunday
week mind sunday week

  sarah was glad to have the reconcilia-
tion so easy but woman-like when she
saw the storm was over and her own fears
groundless she at once repeated the cause
of offense

  sunday so be it she said without
looking up if abel isnt there on satur-
day then she looked up saucily though
her heart was full of fear of another out-
the coming of abel behenna



burst on the part of her impetuous lover
but the window was empty eric had
taken himself off and with a pout she
resumed her work

   she saw eric no more till sunday after-
noon after the bans had been called the
third time when he came up to her be-
fore all the people with an air of propri-
etorship which half pleased and half
annoyed her

  not yet mister she said pushing
him away as the other girls giggled
wait till sunday next if you please-
the day after saturday she added look-
ing at him saucily

  the girls giggled again and the young
men guffawed they thought it was the
snub that touched him so that he became
as white as a sheet as he turned away but
sarah who knew more than they did
laughed for she saw triumph through the
spasm of pain that overspread his face

  the week passed uneventfully how-
ever as saturday drew nigh sarah had
occasional moments of anxiety and eric
went about at night-time like a man pos-
sessed he restrained himself when
others were by but now and again he
went down amongst the rocks and caves
and shouted aloud this seemed to re-
lieve him somewhat and he was better
able to restrain himself for some time
after all saturday he stayed in his own
house and never left it as he was to be
married on the morrow the neighbors
thought it was shyness on his part and
did not trouble or notice him only once
was he disturbed and that was when the
chief boatman came to him and sat down
and after a pause said

   eric i was over in bristol yesterday
i was in the ropemakers getting a coil to
replace the one you lost the night of the
storm and there i saw michael heavens
of this place who is salesman there he
told me that abel behenna had come

home the week ere last on the star of the
sea from canton and that he had lodged
a sight of money in the bristol bank in
the name of sarah behenna he told
michael so himself-and that he had
taken a passage on the lovely alice to
pencastle bear up man for eric had
with a groan dropped his head on his
knees with his face between his hands
he was your old comrade i know but
you couldnt help him he must have
gone down with the rest that awful night
i thought id better tell you lest it might
come some other way and you might
keep sarah trefusis from being fright-
ened they were good friends once and
women take these things to heart it
would not do to let her be pained with
such a thing on her wedding day

  then he rose and went away leaving
eric still sitting disconsolately with his
head on his knees

  poor fellow murmured the chief
boatman to himself he takes it to heart
well well right enough they were
true comrades once and abel saved him
the afternoon of that day when the
children had left school they strayed as
usual on half-holidays along the quay and
the paths by the cliffs presently some of
them came running in a state of great ex-
citement to the harbor where a few men
were unloading a coal ketch and a great
many were superintending the operation
one of the children called out

  there is a porpoise in the harbor
mouth we saw it come through the
blow-hole it had a long tail and was
deep under the water

  it was no porpoise said another
it was a seal but it had a long tail it
came out of the seal cave

  the other children bore various testi-
mony but on two points they were unan-
imous-it whatever it was had come
through the blow-hole deep under the


weird tales

water and had a long thin tail-a tail so
long that they could not see the end of it

  there was much unmerciful chaffing
of the children by the men on this point
but as it was evident that they had seen
something quite a number of persons
young and old male and female went
along the high paths on either side of the
harbor-mouth to catch a glimpse of this
new addition to the fauna of the sea a
long-tailed porpoise or seal the tide
was now coming in there was a slight
breeze and the surface of the water was
rippled so that it was only at moments
that any one could see clearly into the
deep water after a spell of watching a
woman called out that she saw something
moving up the channel just below where
she was standing there was a stampede
to the spot but by the time the crowd had
gathered the breeze had freshened and it
was impossible to see with any distinct-
ness below the surface of the water on
being questioned the woman described
what she had seen but in such an inco-
herent way that the whole thing was put
down as an effect of imagination had it
not been for the childrens report she
would not have been credited at all her
semi-hysterical statement that what she
saw was like a pig with the entrails out
was only thought anything of by an old
coast guard who shook his head but did
not make any remark for the remainder
of the daylight this man was seen always
on the bank looking into the water but
always with disappointment manifest on
his face

eric arose early on the next morning-
he had not slept all night and it was
a relief to him to move about in the light
he shaved himself with a hand that did
not tremble and dressed himself in his
wedding clothes there was a haggard
look on his face and he seemed as though

he had grown years older in the last few
days still there was a wild uneasy light
of triumph in his eyes and he kept mur-
muring to himself over and over again

  this is my wedding day abel can
not claim her now-living or dead-liv-
ing or dead living or dead

  he sat in his armchair waiting with an
uncanny quietness for the church hour to
arrive when the bell began to ring he
arose and passed out of his house closing
the door behind him he looked at the
river and saw that the tide had just
turned in the church he sat with sarah
and her mother holding sarahs hand
tightly in his all the time as though he
feared to lose her when the service was
over they stood up together and were
married in the presence of the entire con-
gregation for no one left the church
both made the responses clearly-erics
being even on the defiant side when the
wedding was over sarah took her hus-
bands arm and they walked away to-
gether the boys and younger girls being
cuffed by their elders into a decorous be-
havior for they would fain have fol-
lowed close behind their heels

  the way from the church led down to
the back of erics cottage a narrow pas-
sage being between it and that of his
next neighbor when the bridal couple
had passed through this the remainder
of the congregation who had followed
them at a little distance were startled by
a long shrill scream from the bride
they rushed through the passage and
found her on the bank with wild eyes
pointing to the river bed opposite eric
sansons door

  the falling tide had deposited there
the body of abel behenna stark upon the
broken rocks the rope trailing from its
waist had been twisted by the current
round the mooring-post and had held it
back whilst the tide had ebbed away from
the coming of abel behenna



it the right elbow had fallen in a chink
in the rock leaving the hand outstretched
toward sarah with the open palm up-
ward as though it were extended to re-
ceive hers the pale drooping fingers open
to the clasp

  all that happened afterward was never
quite known to sarah sanson when-
ever she would try to recollect there

would come a buzzing in her ears and a
dimness in her eyes and all would pass
away the only thing that she could re-
member of it at all-and this she never
forgot-was erics breathing heavily
with his face whiter than that of the dead
man as he muttered under his breath
devils help devils faith devils

   vyloak from messer lando

   by august w derleth

      a short story about cesare borgia and the magic of a
      mediaeval sorcerer

the hooded horseman drew up
before the shadowed figure
crouching against the dark wall of
a building backed against the alley he
bent forward and looked down though
the streets cf rome were faintly illumined
by the moonlight the man in the alley
sat in deep shadow yet the rider saw
that he was an old man for a beard was
in evidence

  can you ride old man

  the old man looked speculatively up
at the rider eyeing his proud horse and
the rich trappings bedecking both rider
and steed

  how did you know i was tired mes-
ser he asked

  i saw you lag and observed your
footsteps grow weary come he added
impatiently will you ride or no

   i will ride

  the old man got to his feet and
clasped the strong hand which was ex-
tended downward to assist him to the
back of the horse behind the rider

  i was of a mind to walk tonight
murmured the old man but i repent it
now my bones are old

  the horse jogged forward and as the
rider half turned his hood fell back ex-
posing to the moonlight a handsome
youthful face marked by both strength
and cruelty with a mouth at the same
time commanding brutal and sensuous
the old mans sharp eyes saw and recog-
nized the face

  is it not dangerous for your high-
ness to ride alone in the streets of rome
at night he inquired in a soft voice
ah    you know me

  you are the prince-cardinal cesare
borgia there are few who do not know
you replied the old man

  and you are not afraid as others
are a momentary surprize gleamed in
the riders eyes

  the old man shrugged i do not trust
you but neither do i fear you he said

  well said old man your courage
belies your bones who are you


weird tales

  i am one lando a garment-maker by
occupation by reputation a magician

  i have heard of you

  kind words your eminence but
mayhap of someone else he peered out
from behind the prince-cardinal borgia
and added i dismount at the alley just
ahead if it please you

  for one of your age you travel in
strange quarters old man surely it is an
odd hour to pursue your occupation
true agreed messer lando but
not my reputation

  messer lando dismounted and stood
for a moment beside the horse before he
said a pox on my bones and my
gratitude for your kindness your mag-
nificence i shall bear it well in memory
i am not often kind said the prince-
cardinal borgia in a cold voice

  therefore this kindness will be twice-
remembered replied the old man im-
perturbably good-night

  he turned and was lost in the darkness
beyond the light of the gibbous moon
cesare borgia jingled his trappings medi-
tatively and rode thoughtfully away into
the moonlight

messer lando meanwhile made his
way from door to darkened door
until at last he came upon a vast pile at
the back door of which a green lantern
burned beneath the lantern stood a
dark figure the old man spying him
advanced directly upon him and greeted
him

  i am here he said

  for his magnificence asked the
figure

  him

  then come

  he turned swung open the door
behind him and led the way into the
house messer lando came at his heels
they passed down a long stone corridor

damp and cool mounted a flight of stairs
and arrived at another passage half its
length they went to pause at last before
a great door where the guide bowed and
turned back

  messer lando tapped gently on the
door

  come bade a voice from beyond the
panels

  messer lando opened the door and
entered the room at a table near the far
wall sat a middle-aged heavy-jowled
man whose long mustache curved around
his mouth he was clad in a sable robe
and about his neck hung a golden chain
from which depended a jeweled cross
this the duke of solento for it was he
handled with heavily beringed fingers

  the magician advanced into the room
bowing humbly and came to a halt
before the heavy table where having
caught the dukes eye he waited obsequi-
ously

  messer lando said the duke pres-
ently

  i have come your highness

  no one has seen you

  none

  a momentary silence fell in the spa-
cious heavily draped room and the mage
stared in troubled perplexity at the face
of the duke of solento something
stirred in the old mans memory at sound
of the dukes voice and he remembered
an incident that had happened in flor-
ence a small fire came into his old eyes

  abruptly he spoke i have no thought
as to your desire with me he said cal-
culatingly but long have i admired
your highness long have i wished to
make you a cloak of spun gold i lack
only your permission

  the duke of solento peered at the
old man and smiled broadly flattery
pleases me he admitted unctuously
permission is given but now let us
a cloak from messer lando



come to the matter which i have in mind
i am told you make wondrous cloaks-
cloaks of such beauty that they are like
fire to the wearer

  your highness says it well said the
magician inclining his head those of
my cloaks to which you refer are so beau-
tiful that their wearers can wear them but
once and can not resist that wearing for
the potency of their charm

  fire destroys said the duke craftily
like fire the fabric of my magic
cloaks destroys the flesh murmured the
old man

  you understand me well messer
lando it appears that i have an enemy
who is desirous of moving against me
he has power should he choose to ex-
ercise his power i shall be slain and my
estates confiscated

  his name

  it is not necessary for you to know
you need not tell me it is cesare
the prince-cardinal borgia

  the duke of solento started at the
magicians calm statement indeed you
are a mage messer lando he said

  the magician smiled thinly knowing
the duke of solento for a fool for only
one man in rome had the power de-
scribed and his name was no secret

  tell me how soon can i have this
cloak

  when the hour-glass has run its
course twenty-four times the cloak will
be in your hands but would it not be
better if the cloak for the borgia came
from me so that no suspicion might at-
tach to you

  well spoken messer lando it shall
be as you say the duke took from a
pocket a pouch of ducats which he flung
to the table

  messer lando came forward and took
up the pouch

  i shall await intelligence of the bor

gias death said the duke of solento in
a mockingly triumphant voice

  i too shall wait your highness

  go now as you came

the magician bowed himself from
the room passed down the corridor
to the lower floor and from there once
again into the soundless darkness of the
alley behind the palazzo solento his
lips were still held in their thin ironic
smile and his thoughts were concerned
with the man he had just left not as the
duke of solento but as a captain of con-
dottieri in florence years before it was
fitting he reflected that in his old years
he should come upon this man again

  he made his way swiftly disregarding
the ache of his bones and came present-
ly to the hidden place where he made his
home he went beyond his outer rooms
beyond the room where he had brewed
many a hellish potion into another faint-
ly lit by blue flames from a tiny brazier a
room the very atmosphere of which was
potent with menace

  the mage took off his outer garments
and dropped them to the floor then he
set himself before a contrivance which no
human eye but his had ever seen and
upon this queer loom-like thing messer
lando wove two cloaks one of spun gold
and while he worked he mouthed en-
chantments and spoke to the darkness
which answered him in tongues of violet
flame carrying the odor of sulfur and
brimstone which the mind of man has
long bound up with the powers of dark-
ness he mused long too on the heart-
less cruelty of that captain who had since
become duke of solento remembering
the agony of the soldier the mages
friend who had died at the captains
order and remembering the kindness
of cesare borgia he smiled

  far into the dawn he worked far into
the day yet the room being window-


weird tales

less was dark and as he worked two
cloaks came into being beneath his fin-
gers only after another night had fallen
beyond his humble dwelling did messer
lando cease work the cloaks being fin-
ished

  then he sat down and wrote a message
from the duke of solento he put his
magic into words of honeyed flattery be-
seeching the duke to accept from him the
cloak of spun gold which his highness
had allowed messer lando to weave for
him having accomplished his most art-
ful words messer lando summoned
lackeys to one he gave the message and
the wondrous cloak of spun gold to the
other he gave his second cloak a somber
smoldering red with a strangely wrought
lining of silver and black

  then only did he bethink himself of
food and sleep and with a queer thin
smile on his worn lips he set about pro-
curing both

he woke at dawn and dressed him-
self with feverish impatience with
the sun he entered the streets of rome
where only the early tradesmen were
about he made his way from alley to
alley from street to street his path being
much the same as that he had made not
long before at night presently he ar-
rived at the palazzo solento

  the bustle of activity that marked the
palace of the duke of solento was wel-
come to his eyes he smiled approached
a footman and asked what causes this
ceaseless running to and fro-if it please
you to inform a curious old man

  the footman stopped the duke of

solento is dead and all is in uproar here
we have only just now found him lying
upon the stones where he threw himself
in his agony

  he died of a fall murmured the
mage

  the footman abruptly lowered his
voice and glanced around him shaking
his head no messer there is an
unholy strangeness about his death he
wore a new cloak last night and when he
tried to take it off he could not and
sometime in the night he threw himself
from the window on the stairs and
now-when they tried to take the cloak
from him they saw that it had eaten its
way into his flesh its threads like burn-
ing tendrils of a vine deep deep in his
body

  suddenly a shout went up and the
lackeys scattered like chaff before a wind
a group of well-armed horsemen had
swept abruptly into the square before the
palace and were even now spreading in-
tently around the building surrounding
it at their head rode the prince-cardinal
cesare borgia and around his shoulders
gleaming in the early morning sunlight
he wore the red cloak from messer lando

  the mage smiled his pleasure for as
the wind whipped the cloak out behind
the borgia the mage saw his dark-woven
letters as fine bars set against the lining
of the cloak and though he could not
read them he knew that the borgia had
read them and he remembered what he
had woven

  it pleases messer lando to remember
a kindness and to avenge an old wrong
ride forth and seize the estates of solen-
to for he plots against your life
  coming next month

   an old man withered and disreputable-looking in a robe that appeared no less
- antique and unsavory than himself was standing near to the fire he was not en-
gaged in any visible culinary operations and in view of the torrid sun it hardly
seemed that he required the warmth given by the queer-colored blaze aside from this
individual ralibar vooz looked in vain for the participants of the muttered conversation
he had just overheard he thought there was an evanescent fluttering of dim grotesque
shadows around the obsidian block but the shadows faded and vanished in an instant and
since there were no objects or beings that could have cast them ralibar vooz deemed that
he had been victimized by another of those highly disagreeable optic illusions in which that
part of the mountain seemed to abound

   the old man eyed the hunter with a fiery gaze and began to curse him in fluent but
somewhat archaic diction as he descended into the hollow at the same time a lizard-
tailed and sooty-feathered bird which seemed to belong to some night-flying species of
archaeopteryx began to snap its toothed beak and flap its digited wings on the objection-
ably shapen stela that served it for a perch this stela standing on the lee side of the
fire and very close to it had not been perceived by ralibar vooz at first glance

   may the ordure of demons bemire you from heel to crown cried the venomous an-
cient o lumbering bawling idiot you have ruined a most promising and important
evocation how you came here i can not imagine i have surrounded this place with
twelve circles of illusion whose effect is multiplied by their myriad intersections and the
chance that any intruder would ever find his way to my abode was mathematically small
and insignificant ill was that chance which brought you here for they that you have
frightened away will not return until the high stars repeat a certain rare and quickly pass-
ing conjunction and much wisdom is lost to me in the interim   

   the astounding adventures of ralibar vooz which followed his affront to the old
man make a saga as unusual as it is interest-gripping you can not afford to miss this
strange tale which will be published complete in weird tales for october

from time to time we are importuned
by our readers to devote several pages
of weird tales each month to a
forum in which the lovers of fantastic fic-
tion can exchange views we are asked to
have articles on weird fiction generally in-
formation about our authors debates between
the fans it has been suggested that we ex-
pand the eyrie for this purpose and make
it a battleground for the conflicts of the
weird fiction fans this we have stedfastly
refused to do for weird tales after all is
a magazine of fiction and undue expansion
of the eyrie or the opening of a new de-
partment to satisfy the fans would take just
that much space away from weird stories
which are our primary interest so instead
of reducing our story space to make room
for such a department we suggest to those
of you who are interested that you write
to charles d hornig editor of the fantasy
fan whose home address is  west
grand street elizabeth new jersey we
have been receiving the fantasy fan for
several months and we think it is just the
forum you want-that is those of you who
make weird fiction your hobby the fantasy
fan does not appear on the news stands but
mr hornig can supply you with detailed
information about it

  constant reader airs his thoughts

  joseph t ryerson of muskegon heights
michigan writes to the eyrie having
been a constant reader of wt ever since its
conception i feel its about time i aired my
thoughts i just read in the july issue the
reprint from your first issue the dead
mans tale and reel that your present auth-
ors will have to keep on their toes in order
to maintain the standard of that story but
for sheer pathos and beauty one christmas

     

eve stands out above the rest it was a very
fortunate circumstance that robert e how-
ard did not have a hand in writing through
the gates of the silver key for it is a
humdinger as it is    no biographies of

a new high mark

  b m reynolds of north adams massa-
chusetts writes congratulations on your
july issue it was a knockout and then some
i dont believe you have ever put out an
issue containing so many stories of superb
quality and high standard you have cer-
tainly set a new high mark through the
gates of the silver key was a classic and
positively the best piece of work those in-
comparable artists lovecraft and price have
ever done its cosmic scope and imaginative
brilliance certainly give one plenty of food
for thought by all means give us a sequel
to this story and get randolph carter or one
of his facets back to earth again arlton
eadie takes second honors with his new
mystery serial the trail of the cloven
hoof this is the best serial since golden
blood and the best work i have ever seen
by eadie if he can sustain the present high
mark of eery mystery and nameless horror
throughout the forthcoming chapters he will
have written a masterpiece the master of
souls by harold ward was also a very en-
tertaining and unusual story having a most
bizarre and original theme wards work
has been steadily improving and i am sur-
prized he does not receive more comment

weird tales

 continued from page 

jroved constantly and is the best magazine
of any type on the market i like brun-
dages covers though i think some weird
monsters in addition to the human figures
would be good please dont enlarge the
eyrie until it crowds out a couple of short
stories the plan of making extracts of the
important parts of the letters is best and
i hope the majority of the readers vote
against an authors page in the july issue
through the gates of the silver key was my
first choice it was marvelous it filled my
head with mighty thoughts and great yearn-
ings i give the illusion of flame by paul
ernst second place    your newest auth-
or c l moore is excellent i am eagerly
waiting for his story dust of gods my
favorite story characters are conan and
northwest smith the bloody adventures of
conan are very interesting and c l moore
has such unusual and original conceptions
that reading his stories is a pleasure i am
fed up with stories of animated corpses and
vampires  i like the fantastic and imag-
inative story better than the scary one espe-
cially do i like stories about undeveloped
and unknown powers of the mind

about our authors

  robert bloch of milwaukee writes in
heavens name publish that authors page
wt has a very interesting staff of authors
indeed no one could claim a more inter-
esting career than price soldier of fortune
etc howard a typical barbarian like his
own conan lovecraft the recluse derleth
the descendant of a count who fled the
french revolution quinn and his interesting
job yet the bulk of your readers know
nothing of these fascinating facts loosen
up with them

arlton eadies stories

  emil petaja of milltown montana
writes although i have just had time to
glance over the july issue of weird tales
the stories appear to be unusually excellent
i am glad to see a novel by arlton eadie
it seems to me that his stories have never
been fully appreciated by your readers one
of his tales the avenging shadow which
appeared in  was never mentioned in
the eyrie but it struck me as being one of
the best tales you have ever published   

i want to say a word regarding suggestions
made of late with reference to a quarterly
or mid-monthly magazine to be devoted to
longer stories reprints etc i consider this
a splendid idea you could publish in it long
serial reprints both from back issues of
weird tales and stories such as the wolf-
leader by dumas which appeared serially as
a reprint in wt this could appear quar-
terly and be twice as large as wt and sell
for fifty cents in this you could give in-
formation on old forbidden magic true
weird tales and old writers like cagliostro
roger bacon etc with regard to a page
giving information about your authors i
agree with you by all means dont have one
in many cases these would detract from the
authors popularity i can see no reason for
kicking about your covers individually
each is a work of art and the weird atmos-
phere is uppermost in each

more vampire stories

  miss andre cross of hollywood cali-
fornia writes for three years i have been
a faithful reader of weird tales and i have
never found anything to make a comment
about i was never very interested in writ-
ing fan letters but it seems i must write to
you and say how much i enjoy every word
of your magazine it is simply supreme
your cover designs are extremely attractive
and if they are not actually done by a wo-
man they have the fine delicate touch of a
woman  i think you should have more
stories of vampires and stories such as the
return of balkis the sapphire goddess
and revelations in black give us more of
the charming fascinating character monsieur
jules de grandin the gallant frenchman
and his adventures

by air mail

  fred anger of berkeley california
writes weird tales is certainly improv-
ing steadily every new copy gets better and
better evidently there is no end to your
progress the first installment of the trail of
the cloven hoof is as good a piece of weird
fiction as it is possible to find mr eadie
has given us nothing but the best in all the
years he has been writing the trail of the
cloven hoof equals if not excels the
world-wrecker of several years ago con-
gratulations mr eadie through the gates
