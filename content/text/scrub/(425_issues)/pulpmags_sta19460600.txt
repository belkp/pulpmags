hold everything frogeyes keep
wart-ears and snaggletooth back
on the other side of the ship yes
let the zeno lie unopened for a few mercuri-
an minutes theyre a lot shorter than earth
minutes ye sarge has a serious serious
yes serious question to propound to his
readers

  stf seems to be definitely on the upgrade
of late if only to judge by the staggering
sacks of mail that are reaching this old space
canine over the televisor v-weapons the
atomic bomb and radar to the moon and be-
yond seem definitely to have gripped the
mass imagination

  quiet snaggletooth masses do so have
imagination-you merely have to dig deep
with a ray-powered drill to tap it pardon
people while i dip this gremlin in the port
xeno vat

  here is what the sarge wants to know-
since stf is becoming something of a house-
hold world now that man is straying beyond
the stratosphere should the sarge hammer
the bung into the xeno keg drop his three
bemlins through the starboard space lock
and play it straight

  should he keep on kicking the same old
neptunian gong around bad puns worse
poetry and all

  or should he strain for compromise soft-
peddling wart-ears snaggie and frogeyes
sip xeno only occasionally and break into
song and ribald laughter only once or twice
an issue meanwhile dishing out more sober
comment

lets have a poll

  his fate is in your hands-so lets have a
reader poll on the subject

  okay frogeyes roll out the xeno you
might as well be useful rather than sit and
sulk because this old astrogator has turned
the fate of you and your two fellow mobile
arcturian shock absorbers over to the fans

let us drink to chad oliver the crystal
city texas gazer

  old chad familiar to recent eons of readers
as the oliver-oil bearer of the great south-
west has accomplished the hitherto impossi-
ble he has photographed the sarge yes
thats old saturn towering over his slaves
on the left end the cute little fellow with

the xeno bladder is snaggletooth as any fool
can plainly see frogeyes next to him is
less obvious since he is squinting into the
sun but wart-ears nodular cranial protuber-
ances are plainly in evidence at the right we
are all wearing space suits and ready to take
off

  thanks again chad old thing for letting
the readers know what ye sarge really looks
like-especially after those slanderous draw-
ings alleged that so many other iconoclasts
have been shipping him we salute you with
a triple xeno

our next issue

jealous helots of the world to come can
practice deep breathing against the drape
shape of things to come for that ace astro-
gator of the spaceways captain future with
all of his followers in fine fettle is due to
show in another rocket-propelled novel when
again our orbit swings near earth

chapter i

fire in the night

to the north thin smoke made a col-
umn against the darkening sky again
i felt the unreasoning fear the impulse
toward nightmare flight that had been with

me for a long time now i knew it was with-
out reason there was only smoke rising
from the swamps of the tangled limberlost
country not fifty miles from chicago where
man has outlawed superstition with strong
bonds of steel and concrete

i knew it was only a campers fire yet
i knew it was not something far back in

an amazing fantastic novel


	startling stories

my mind knew what the smoke rose from
and who stood about the fire peering my
way through the trees

  i looked away my glance slipping around
the crowded walls-shelves bearing the ran-
dom fruit of my uncles magpie collectors
instinct opium pipes of inlaid work and
silver golden chessmen from india a
sword   

 deep memories stirred within me-deep
panic i was beneath the sword in two
strides tearing it from the wall my fingers
cramping hard around the hilt not fully
aware of what i did i found myself facing
the window and the distant smoke again
the sword was in my fist but feeling wrong
not reassuring not as the sword ought to
feel

  easy ed my uncles deep voice said
behind me whats the matter you look-
sortof wild

  its the wrong sword i heard myself say-
ing helplessly

  then something like a mist cleared from
my brain i blinked at him stupidly wonder-
ing what was happening to me my voice
answered

  it isnt the sword it should have come
from cambodia it should have been one of
the three talismans of the fire king and the
water king three very great talismans-
the fruit of cut gathered at the time of the
deluge but still fresh-the rattan with flow-
ers that never fade and the sword of yan
the guarding spirit

  my uncle squinted at me through pipe-
smoke he shook his head

  youve changed ed he said in his deep
gentle voice youve changed a lot i sup-
pose because of the war-its to be expected
and youve been sick but you never used
to be interested in things like that before
i think you spend too much time at the li-
braries id hoped this vacation would help
the rest-

  i dont want rest i said violently i
spent a year and a half resting in sumatra
doing nothing but rest in that smelly little
jungle village waiting and waiting and wait-
ing

i could see and smell it now i could
feel again the fever that had raged so
long through me as i lay in the tabooed hut

 my mind went back eighteen months to
the last hour when things were normal for
me it was in the closing phases of world

war ii and i was flying over the sumatran
jungle war of course is never good or
normal but until that one blinding moment
in the air i had been an ordinary man sure
of myself sure of my place in the world with
no nagging fragments of memory too elusive
to catch

  then everything blanked out suddenly and
completely i never knew what it was there
was nothing it could have been my only
injuries came when the plane struck and
they were miraculously light but i had been
whole and unhurt when the blindness and
blankness came over me

  the friendly bataks found me as i lay in
the ruined plane they brought me through
a fever and a raging illness with their
strange crude effective ways of healing but
i sometimes thought they had done me no
service when they saved me and their
witch-doctor had his doubts too

  he knew something he worked his curi-
ous futile charms with knotted string and
rice sweating with effort i did not under-
stand-then i remembered the scarred ugly
mask looming out of the shadow the hands
moving in gestures of strange power

  come back o soul where thou are lin-
gering in the wood or in the hills or by the
river see i call thee with a toemba bras
with an egg of the fowl rajah moelija with
the eleven healing leaves  

  yes they were sorry for me at first all of
them the witch-doctor was the first to sense
something wrong and the awareness spread
i could feel it spreading as their attitude
changed they were afraid not of me i
thought but of-of what

  before the helicopter came to take me back
to civilization the witch-doctor told me a lit-
tle as much perhaps as he dared

  you must hide my son all your life you
must hide something is searching for you-
he used a word i did not understand -and
it has come from the other world the ghost-
lands to hunt you down remember this all
magic things must be taboo to you and if
that too fails perhaps you may find a weapon
in magic but we cannot help you our
powers are not strong enough for that

  he was glad to see me go they were all
glad

  and after that unrest for something had
changed me utterly the fever perhaps
at any rate i didnt feel like the same man
there were dreams memories-haunting
urgencies as if i had somehow somewhere
standing before the window my arm swept up without volition and-as medea and edeyrn stared hi horror-
i brought the sword called uyr smashing down chap xv
	startling stories

 left some vital job unfinished   

i found myself talking more freely to my
uncle

 it was like a curtain lifting a curtain of
 gauze i saw some things more clearly-
 they seemed to have a different significance
 things happen to me now that would have
 seemed incredible-before now they dont

 ive traveled a lot you know it doesnt
 help theres always something to remind
 me an amulet in a pawnshop window a
 knotted string a cats-eye opal and two fig-
 ures i see them in my dreams over and
 over and once-

 i stopped

yes my uncle prompted softly

it was in new orleans i woke up one
night and there was something in my room
very close to me i had a gun-a special sort
of gun-under my pillow when i reached
for it the-call it a dog-sprang from the
window only it wasnt shaped quite like a
dog i hesitated there were silver bullets
in the revolver i said

my uncle was silent for a long moment i
knew what he was thinking

 the other figure he said finally

i dont know it wears a hood i think
its very old and beyond these two-

yes

a voice a very sweet voice haunting
a fire and beyond the fire a face i have
never seen clearly

my uncle nodded the darkness had drawn
in i could scarcely see him and the smoke
outside had lost itself against the shadow of
night but a faint glow still lingered beyond
the trees   or did i only imagine that

i nodded toward the window

 ive seen that firebefore i told him

whats wrong with it campers make
fires

 no its a need-fire

 what the devil is that

 its a ritual i said like the midsum-
 mer fires or the beltane fire the scots used
 to kindle but the need-fire is lighted only
 in time of calamity its a very old custom

my uncle laid hown his pipe and
leaned forward

what is it ed do you have any inkling
at all

 psychologically i suppose you could call
 it a persecution complex i said slowly i-
 believe in things i never used to i think
 someone is trying to find me-has found me

and is calling who it is i dont know what
they want i dont know but a little while
ago i found out one more tiling-this sword
i picked the sword up from the table

  it isnt what i want i went on but
sometimes when my mind is-abstract
something from outside floats into it like
the need for a sword and not any sword-
just one i dont know what the sword looks
like but id know if i held it in my hand
i laughed a little and if i drew it a few
inches from the sheath i could put out that
fire up there as if id blown on it like a can-
dle-flame and if i drew the sword all the
way out-the world would come to an end
my uncle nodded after a moment he
spoke

  the doctors he asked what do they
say

  i know what they would say if i told
them i said grimly pure insanity if i
could be sure of that id feel happier one
of the dogs was killed last night you know
of course old duke another dog from
some farm eh

  or a wolf the same wolf that got into
my room last night and stood over me like
a man and clipped off a lock of my hair
something flamed up far away beyond the
window and was gone in the dark the
need-fire

  my uncle rose and stood looking down at
me in the dimness he laid a big hand on my
shoulder

  i think youre sick eld

  you think im crazy well i may be
bat ive got a hunch im going to know soon
one way or the other

  i picked up the sheathed sword and laid
it across my knees we sat in silence for
what seemed like a long time

  in the forest to the north the need-fire
turned steadily i could not see it but its
james stirred in my blood-dangerously-
darkly

chapter ii
call of the red witch

 could not sleep the suffocating
breathlessness of late summer lay like a
woollen blanket over me presently i went
into the big room and restlessly searched for
cigarettes my uncles voice came through
tiie dark world	

an open doorway

  all right ed

  yeah i cant sleep yet maybe ill read

  i chose a book at random sank into a re-
laxer chair and switched on a lamp it was
utterly silent i could not even hear the faint
splashing of little waves on the lakeshore

 there was something i wanted-

  a trained riflemans hand at need will itch
for the familiar feeling of smooth wood and
metal similarly my hand was hungry for
the feel of something-neither gun nor
sword i thought a weapon that i had used
before i could not remember what it was
once i glanced at the poker leaning against
the fireplace and thought that was it but
the flash of recognition was gone instantly

 the book was a popular novel i skimmed
through it rapidly the dim faint pulsing
in my blood did not wane it grew stronger
rising from sub-sensory levels a distant
excitement seemed to be growing deep in my
mind

 grimacing i rose to return the book to
its shelf i stood there for a moment my
glance skimming over the titles on impulse
i drew out a volume i had not looked at for
many years the book of common prayer

  it fell open in my hands a sentence blazed
out from the page

  i am become as it were a monster unto many

 i put back the book and returned to my
chair i was in no mood for reading the
lamp overhead bothered me and i pressed
the switch instantly moonlight flooded the
room-and instantly the curious sense of ex-
pectancy was heightened as though i had
lowered a-a barrier

 the sheathed sword still lay on the win-
dow-seat i looked past it to the clouded
sky where a golden moon shone faint far
away a glimmer showed-the need-fire
blazing in the swampy wilderness of the lim-
berlost

  and it called

  the golden square of window was hypnotic
i lay back in my chair half-closing my eyes
while the sense of danger moved coldly with-
in my brain sometimes before i had felt
this call summoning me and always before
i had been able to resist

  this time i wavered

 the lock of hair clipped from my head-
had that given the enemy power supersti-
tion my logic called it that but a deep in-
ner well of conviction told me that the an-

cient hair-magic was not merely mummery
since that time in sumatra i had been far
legs skeptical and since then i had studied

  the studies were strange enough ranging
from the principles of sympathetic magic to
the wild fables of lycanthropy and demonol-
ogy yet i was amazingly quick at learning

  it was as though i took a refresher course
to remind myself of knowledge i had once
known by heart only one subject really
troubled me and i continually stumbled
across it by roundabout references

  and that was the force the entity dis-
guised in folk-lore under such familiar names
as the black man satan lucifer and such
unfamiliar names as kutchie of the austral-
ian dieris tuna of the esquimaux the afri-
can abonsam and the swiss stratteli

  i did no research on the black man-but
i did not need to there was a recurrent
dream that i could not help identifying with
the dark force that represented evil i would
be standing before a golden square of light
very much afraid and yet straining toward
some consummation that i desired and deep
down within that glowing square there would
be the beginning of motion i knew there
were certain ritual gestures to be made be-
fore the ceremony could be begun but it
was difficult to break the paralysis that held
me

  a square like the moon-drenched window
before me-yet not the same

  for no chill essence of fear thrust itself out
at me now rather the low humming i
heard was soothing gentle as a womans
crooning voice

the golden square wavered-shook-and
little tendrils of crepuscular light fin-
gered out toward me ever the low humming
came alluring and disarming

  golden fingers - tentacles - they darted
here and there as if puzzled they touched
lamp table carpet and drew back they-
touched me

  swiftly they leaped forward now-avid
i had time for a momentary pulse of alarm
before they wrapped me in an embrace like
golden sands of sleep the humming grew
louder and i responded to it

  as the skin of the flayed satyr marsyas
thrilled at the sound of his native phrygian
melodies i knew this music i knew this-
chant

  stole through the golden glow a crouching
shadow-not human-with amber eyes and
	startling stories

a bristling mane-the shadow of a wolf

  it hesitated glanced over its shoulder ques-
tioningly and now another shape swam into
view cowled and gowned so that nothing of
its face or body showed but it was small-
small as a child

  wolf and cowled figure hung in the golden
mists watching and waiting the sighing
murmur altered formed itself into syllables
and words words in no human tongue but-
i knew them

  ganelon i call you ganelon by the
seal in your blood-hear me

  ganelon surely that was my name i
knew it so well

  yet who called me thus

  i have called you before but the way was
not open now the bridge is made come
to me ganelon

  a sigh

  the wolf glanced over a bristling shoulder
snarling the cowled figure bent toward me
i sensed keen eyes searching me from the
darkness of the hood and an icy breath
touched me

  he has forgotten medea said a sweet
high-pitched voice like the tone of a child

  again the sigh has he forgotten me
ganelon ganelon have you forgotten the
arms of medea the lips of medea

  i swung cradled in the golden mists half
asleep

  he has forgotten the cowled figure said
then let him come to me nevertheless
ganelon the need-fire bums the gate-
way lies open to the dark world by fire
and earth air and darkness i summon you
ganelon

  he has forgotten

bring him we have the power now
the golden sands thickened flame-eyed
wolf and robed shadow swam toward me
i felt myself lifted-moving forward not of
my own volition

  the window swung wide i saw the sword
sheathed and ready i snatched up the weap-
on but i could not resist that relentless tide
that carried me forward wolf and whisper-
ing shadow drifted with me

  to the fire bring him to the fire 

  he has forgotten medea

  to the fire edeyrn to the fire
twisted tree-limbs floated past me far
ahead i saw a flicker it grew larger nearer
it was the need-fire

  faster the tide bore me toward the fire
itself-

 not to caer llyr

 from the depths of my mind the cryptic
 words spewed amber-eyed wolf whirled to
 glare at me cowled shadow swept in closer
 on the golden stream i felt a chill of deadly
 cold drive through the curling mists

 caer llyr the cloaked edeyrn whis-
 pered in the childs sweet voice he remem-
 bers caer llyr-but does he remember
 llyr

 he will remember he has been sealed
 to llyr and in caer llyr the place of
 llyr he will remember

 the need-fire was a towering pillar a few
 yards away i fought against the dragging
 tide

 i lifted my sword-threw the sheath away
 i cut at the golden mists that fettered me

 under the ancient steel the shining fog-
 wraiths shuddered and were torn apart-and
 drew back there was a break in the hum-
 ming harmony for an instant utter silence

then-

 matholch the invisible whisperer cried
 lord matholch

 the wolf crouched fangs bared i aimed
 a cut at its snarling mask it avoided the
 blow easily and sprang

 it caught the blade between its teeth
 and wrenched the hilt from my grip

 the golden fogs surged back folding me
 in their warm embrace

 caer llyr they murmured

 the need-fire roared up in a scarlet foun-
 tain

 caer llyr the flames shouted

 and out of those fires rose-a woman

 hair dark as midnight fell softly to her
 knees under level brows she flashed one
 glance at me a glance that held question and
 a fierce determination she was loveliness
 incarnate dark loveliness

 lilith medea witch of colchis

and-

 the gateway closes the child-volce of
 edeyrn said

 the wolf still mouthing my sword
 crouched uneasily but the woman of the
 fire said no word

 she held out her arms to me

 the golden clouds thrust me forward into
 those white arms

 wolf and cowled shadow sprang to flank
 us the humming rose to a deep-pitched
 roar-a thunder as of crashing worlds

 it is difficult difficult medea said help
the dark world

 me edeym lord matholch

 the fires died around us was not the
 moonlit wilderness of the limberlost but
 empty grayness a featureless grayness that
 stretched to infinity not even stars showed
 against that blank

 and now there was fear in the voice of
 edeyrn

 medea i have not the-power  stayed
 too long in the earth-world

 open the gate medea cried thrust
 it open but a little way or we stay here
 between the worlds forever

 the wolf crouched snarling t felt energy
 pouring out of his beast-body his brain that
 was not the brain of a beast

 around us the golden clouds were dissi-
 pating

 the grayness stole in

 ganelon medea said ganelon help
 me

 a door in my mind opened a formless
 darkness stole in

 i felt that deadly evil shadow creep
 through me and submerge my mind under
 ebon waves

 he has the power edeyrn murmured

 he was sealed to llyr let him call on-

 llyr

 no no i dare not llyr but medeas
 face was turned to me questioningly

 at my feet the wolf snarled and strained
 as though by sheer brute strength it might
 wrench open a gateway between locked
 worlds

 now the black sea submerged me utterly

 my thought reached out and was repulsed
 by the dark horror of sheer infinity stretched
 forth again and-

 touched-something

  llyr    llyr

 ttie gateway opens edeyrn said

 the gray emptiness was gone golden
 clouds thinned and vanished around me
 white pillars rose to a vault far far above

 we stood on a raised dais upon which curi-
 ous designs were emblazoned

 the tide of evil which had flowed through
 me had vanished

 but sick with horror and self-loathing i
 dropped to my knees one arm shielding my
 eyes

 i had called on-llyr

arles clung to me in silence
for a moment while above her
head i looked down over the
valley knowing her dreams
could never come true

         chapter m
         locked worlds

aching in every muscle i woke and
lay motionless staring at the low ceil-
ing memory flooded back i turned my head
realizing that i lay on a soft couch padded
with silks and pillows across the bare
simply furnished room was a recessed win-
dow translucent for it admitted light but
i could see only vague blurs through it

  seated beside me on a three-legged stool
was the dwarfed robed figure i knew was
edeym

  not even now could i see the face the
shadows within the cowl were too deep i
felt the keen glint of a watchful gaze though
and a breath of something unfamiliar-cold
and deadly the robes were saffron an ugly
hue that held nothing of life in the harsh
folds staring i saw that the creature was
less than four feet tall or would have been
had it stood upright

  again i heard that sweet childish sexless
voice

  will you drink lord ganelon or eat

  i threw back the gossamer robe covering
me and sat up i was wearing a thin tunic
of silvery softness and trunks of the same
material edeym apparently had not moved
but a drapery swung apart in the wall and
a man came silently in bearing a covered
tray

  sight of him was reassuring he was a
big man sturdily muscled and under a
plumed etruscan-styled helmet his face was
tanned and strong i thought so till i met his
eyes they were blue pools in which horror
had drowned an ancient fear so familiar
that it was almost submerged lay deep in
his gaze

  silently he served me and in silence with-
drew

  edeym nodded toward the tray

  eat and drink you will be stronger
lord ganelon

  there were meats and bread of a sort and
a glass of colorless liquid that was not water
as i found on sampling it i took a sip set
down the chalice and scowled at edeyrn

  i gather that im not insane i said

  you are not your soul has been else-
where-you have been in exile-but you are
home again now

  in caer llyr i asked without quite
knowing why

  edeyrn shook the saffron robes

  no but you must remember

  i remember nothing who are you whats
happened to me

  you know that you are ganelon

  my names edward bond

  yet you almost remembered-at the
need-fire edeym said this will take time
and there is danger always who am i i
am edeyrn-who serves the coven

  are you-

  a woman she said in that childish
sweet voice laughing a little a very old
woman the oldest of the coven now except
for one and as for the coven it has shrunk
from its original thirteen there is medea
of course lord matholch- i remembered
the wolf-ghast rhymi who has more pow-
er than any of us but is too old to use it and
you lord ganelon or edward bond as you
name yourself five of us in all now once
there were hundreds but even i cannot re-
member that time though ghast rhymi can
if he would

  i put my head in my hands

  good heavens i dont know your words
mean nothing to me i dont even know
where i am

  listen she said and i felt a soft touch
on my shoulder you must understand this
you have lost your memories

  thats not true

  it is true lord ganelon your true mem-
ories were erased and you were given arti-
ficial ones all you think you recall now of
your life on the earth-world-all that is false
it did not happen at least not to you
the earth-world im not on earth
this is a different world she said but
it is your own world you came from here
originally the rebels our enemies exiled
you and changed your memories

  thats impossible

  come here edeyrn said and went to
the window she touched something and the
pane grew transparent i looked over her
shrouded head at a landscape i had never
seen before

  or had i

under a dull crimson sun the rolling
forest below lay bathed in bloody light
i was looking down from a considerable
height and could not make out details but
it seemed to me that the trees were oddly
the dark world	 

shaped and that they were moving a river
ran toward distant hills a few white towers
rose from the forest that was all yet the
scarlet huge sun had told me enough this
was not the earth i knew

  another planet

  more than that she said few in the
dark world know this but  know-and
there are some others who have learned un-
luckily for you there are worlds of proba-
bility divergent in the stream of time but
identical almost until the branches diverge
too far

  i dont understand that

  worlds coexistent in time and space-but
separated by another dimension the variant
of probability this is the world that might
have been yours had something not hap-
pened long ago originally the dark world
and the earth-world were one in space and
time then a decision was made-a very vital
decision though i am not sure what it was
from that point the time-stream branched
and two variant worlds existed where there
had been only one before

  they were utterly identical at first ex-
cept that in one of them the key decision
had not been made the results were very
different it happened hundreds of years ago
but the two variant worlds are still close to-
gether in the time stream eventually they
will drift farther apart and grow less like
each other meanwhile they are similar so
much so that a man on the earth-world may
have his twin in the dark world

  his twin

  the man he might have been had the key
decision not been made ages ago in his world
yes twins ganelon-edward bond do you
understand now

  i returned to the couch and sat there
frowning

  two worlds coexistent i can understand
that yes but i think you mean more-that
a double for me exists somewhere

  you were born in the dark world your
double the true edward bond was born on
earth but we have enemies here woods-
runners rebels and they have stolen enough
knowledge to bridge the gulf between time-
variants we ourselves learned the method
only lately though once it was well-known
here among the coven

  the rebels reached out across the gulf
and sent you-sent ganelon-into the earth-
world so that edward bond could come here
among them they-

  but why i interrupted what reason
could they have for that

 edeyrn turned her hooded head toward
me and i felt not for the first time a strange
remote chill as she fixed her unseen gaze
upon my face

  what reason she echoed in her sweet
cool voice think ganelon see if you re-
member

  i thought i closed my eyes and tried to
submerge my conscious mind to let the
memories of ganelon rise up to the surface
if they were there at all i could not yet ac-
cept this preposterous thought in its entirety
but certainly it would explain a great deal
if it were true it would even explain-i
realized suddenly-that strange blanking out
in the plane over the sumatra jungle that
moment from which everything had seemed
so wrong

 perhaps that was the moment when ed-
ward bond left earth and ganelon took his
place-both twins too stunned and helpless
at the change to know what had happened
or to understand

  but this was impossible

  i dont remember i said harshly it
cant have happened i know who i am i
know everything that ever happened to ed-
ward bond you cant tell me that all that is
only illusion its too clear too real

  ganelon ganelon edeyrn crooned to
me a smile in her voice think of the rebel
tribes try ganelon try to remember why
they did what they did to you the woods-
runners ganelon-the disobedient little men
in green the hateful men who threatened
us ganelon surely you remember

  it may have been a form of hypnotism i
thought of that later but at that moment
a picture did swim into my mind i could see
the green-clad swarms moving through the
woods and the sight of them made me hot
with sudden anger for that instant i was
ganelon and a great and powerful lord de-
fied by these underlings not fit to tie my
shoe

 of course you hated them murmured
edeyrn she may have seen the look on my
face i felt the stiffness of an unfamiliar twist
of feature as she spoke i had straightened
where i sat and my shoulders had gone back
arrogantly my lip curling a feeling of scorn
so perhaps she did not read my mind at all
what i thought was plain in my face and
bearing

  of course you punished them when you
	startling stories

could she went on it was your right and
duty but they duped you ganelon they
were cleverer than you they found a door
that would turn on a temporal axis and
thrust you into another world on the far
side of the door was edward bond who did
not hate them so they opened the door

edeyrns voice rose slightly and in it
i detected a note of mockery

  false memories false memories ganelon
you put on edward bonds past when you
put on his identity but he came into our
world as he was free of any knowledge of
ganelon he has given us much trouble my
friend and much bewilderment at first we
did not guess what had gone wrong it
seemed to us that as ganelon vanished from
our coven a strange new ganelon appeared
among the rebels organizing them to fight
against his own people she laughed softly
we had to rouse ghast rhymi from his
sleep to aid us but in the end learning the
method of door-opening we came to earth
and searched for you and found you and
brought you back this is your world lord
ganelon will you accept it

  i shook my head dizzily

  it isnt real im still edward bond

  we can bring back your true memories
and we will they came to the surface for
a moment i think just now but it will take
time meanwhile you are one of the coven
and edward bond is back upon earth in his
old place remembering- she laughed
softly remembering i am sure all he left
undone here but helpless to return or med-
dle again in what does not concern him but
we have needed you ganelon how badly
we have needed you

  what can i do im edward bond
ganelon can do much-when he remem-
bers the coven has fallen upon evil days
once we were thirteen once there were
other covens to join us in our sabbats once
we ruled this whole world under great
llyr but llyr is falling asleep now he
draws farther and farther away from his
worshippers by degrees the dark world
has fallen into savagery and of all the
covens only we remain a broken circle
dwelling close to caer llyr where the great
one sleeps beyond his golden window
she fell silent for a moment

  sometimes i think that llyr does not
sleep at all she said i think he is with-
drawing little by little into some farther

world losing his interest in us whom he cre-
ated but he returns she laughed yes
he returns when the sacrifices stand before
his window and so long as he comes back
the coven has power to force its will upon
the dark world

  but day by day the forest rebels grow
stronger ganelon with our help you were
gathering power to oppose them-when you
vanished we needed you then and we need
you more than ever now you are one of the
coven perhaps the greatest of us all with
matholch you were-

  wait a minute i said im still con-
fused matholch was he the wolf i saw
he was

  you spoke of him as though he were a
man

  he is a man-at times he is lycanthropic
a shape-changer

  a werewolf thats impossible its a
myth a bit of crazy folklore

  what started the myth edeym asked
long ago there were many gateways
opened between the dark world and earth
on earth memories of those days survive
as superstitious tales folklore but with
roots in reality

  its superstition nothing else i said flat-
ly you actually mean that werewolves
vampires and all that exist

  ghast rhymi could tell you more of this
than i can but we cannot wake him for such
a matter perhaps i-well listen the body
is composed of cells these are adaptable
to some extent when they are made even
more adaptable when metabolism is accel-
erated sporadically werewolves come into
being

  the sweet sexless childs voice spoke on
from the shadow of the hood i began to un-
derstand a little on earth college biology
had showed me instances of cells run wild -
malignant tumors and the like and there
were many cases of wolf-men with thick
hair growing like a pelt over them if the
cells could adapt themselves quickly strange
things might occur

  but the bones specialized osseous tissue
not the rigidly brittle bones of the normal
man a psysiological structure that could
theoretically so alter itself that it would be
wolf instead of man was an astounding
theory

  part of it is illusion of course edeyrn
said matholch is not as bestial in form as
he seems yet he is a shape-changer and
the dark world

his form does alter

but how i asked how did he get this
power

for the first time edeym seemed to hesi-
tate he is-a mutation there are many
mutations among us here in the dark world
some are in the coven but others are else-
where

are you a mutation i asked her

yes

a-shape-changer

no edeyrn said and the thin body un-
der the robe seemed to shake a little no
i cannot change my shape lord ganelon
you do not remember my-my powers

 i do not

yet you may find them useful when the
rebels strike again she said slowly yes
there are mutations among us and perhaps
that is the chief reason why the probability -
rift came ages ago there are no mutants on
earth-at least not of our type matholch is
not the only one

 am i a mutant i asked very softly

e cowled head shook

no for no mutant may be sealed to
llyr as you have been sealed one of the
coven must know the key to caer llyr

 the cold breath of fear touched me again
 no not fear horror the deadly monstrous
 breathlessness that always took me when the
 name of llyr was mentioned

  forced myself to say who is llyr

 there was a long silence

 who speaks of llyr a deep voice behind
 me asked better not to lift that veil
 edeyrn

 yet it may be necessary edeyrn said

 i turned and saw framed against the dark
 portiere the rangy whipcord figure of a



 man clad as i was in tunic and trunks hi
 red pointed beard jutted the half-snarling
 curve of his full lips reminded me of some-
 thing agile grace was in every line of his
 wiry body

  yellow eyes watched me with wry amuse-
ment

  pray it may not be necessary the man
said well lord ganelon have you for-
gotten me too

  he has forgotten you matholch edeym
said at least in this form

  matholch-the wolf the shape-changer
  he grinned

  it is sabbat tonight he said the lord
ganelon must be prepared for it also i
think there will be trouble however that
is medeas business and she asks if ganelon
is awake since he is let us see her now

 will you go with matholch edeyrn
asked me

 i suppose so i said the red-beard
grinned again

  ai you have forgotten ganelon in the
old days youd never have trusted me behind
your back with a dagger

  you always knew better than to strike
edeym said if ganelon ever called on
llyr it would be unfortunate for you
well i joked- matholch said carelessly
my enemies must be strong enough to give
me a fight so ill wait till your memory comes
back lord ganelon meanwhile the coven
has its back to the wall and i need you as
badly as you need me will you come

  go with him edeyrn said you are in
no danger-wolfs bark is worse than wolfs
bite-even though this is not caer llyr

  i thought i sensed a hidden threat in her
words matholch shrugged and held the cur-
tain aside to let me pass	turn page
	startling stories

  few dare to threaten a shape-changer
he said over his shoulder

  i dare edeyrn said from the enigmatic
shadows of her saffron cowl and i remem-
bered that she was a mutant too-though not
a lycanthrope like the red-bearded were-
wolf striding beside me along the vaulted
passage

 what was-edeyrn

chapter iv
matholch-and medea

cp to now the true wonder of the situ-
ation had not really touched me yet
the anaesthesia of shock had dulled me as
a soldier-caught in the white light of a flare
dropped from an overhead plane-freezes
into immobility so my mind still remained
passive only superficial thoughts were mov-
ing there as though by concentration on im-
mediate needs i could eliminate the incred-
ible fact that i was not on the familiar solid
ground of earth

  but it was more than this there was a
curious indefinable familiarity about these
groined pale-walled halls through which i
strode beside matholch as there had been a
queer familiarity about the twilit landscape
stretching to forested distance beneath the
window of my room

 edeyrn-medea-the coven

  the names had significance like words in
a language i had once known well but had
forgotten

  the half-loping swift walk of matholch
the easy swing of his muscular shoulders
the snarling smile on his red-bearded lips-
these were not new to me

  he watched me furtively out of his yellow
eyes once we paused before a red-figured
drapery and matholch hesitating thrust the
curtain aside and gestured me forward

  i took one step-and stopped i looked at
him

  he nodded as though satisfied yet there
was still a question in his face

  so you remember a little eh enough to
know that this isnt the way to medea how-
ever come along for a moment i want to
talk to you

  as i followed him up a winding stair i
suddenly realized that he had not spoken in
english but i had understood him as i had

understood edeyrn and medea

  ganelon

 we were in a tower room walled with
transparent panes there was a smoky sour
odor in the air and gray tendrils coiled up
from a brazier set in a tripod in the middle
of the chamber matholch gestured me to
one of the couches by the windows he
dropped carelessly beside me

 i wonder how much you remember he
said

  i shook my head

  not much enough not to be too-trust-
ing

  the artificial earth-memories are still
strong then ghast rhymi said you would
remember eventually but that it would take
time the false writing on the slate of your
mind will fade and the old true memories
will come back after a while

  like a palimpsest i thought-manuscript
with two writings upon its parchment but
ganelon was still a stranger i was still
edward bond

  i wonder matholch said slowly staring
at me you spent much time exiled i
wonder if you have changed basically al-
ways before-you hated me ganelon do
you hate me now

  no i said at least i dont know i
think i distrust you

 you have reason if you remember at
all we have always been enemies ganelon
though bound together by the needs and
laws of the coven i wonder if we need be
enemies any longer

  it depends im not anxious to make en-
emies-especially here

  matholchs red brows drew together

  ai that is not ganelon speaking in the
old days you cared nothing about how many
enemies you made if you have changed so
much danger to us all may result

  my memory is gone i said i dont
understand much of this it seems dream-
like

  now he sprang up and restlessly paced
the room thats well if you become the
old ganelon again well be enemies again
that i know but if earth-exile has changed
you-altered you-we may be friends it
would be better to be friends medea would
not like it i do not think edeyrn would as
for ghast rhymi- he shrugged ghast
rhymi is old-old in all the dark world
ganelon you have the most power or can
have but it would mean going to caer llyr
the dark world	

  matholch stooped to look into my eyes

 in the old days you knew what that
meant you were afraid but you wanted the
power once you went to caer llyr-to be
sealed so there is a bond between you and
llyr-not consummated yet but it can be
if you wish it

  what is llyr i asked

 pray that you will not remember that
matholch said when medea talks to you-
beware when she speaks of llyr i may be
friend of yours or enemy ganelon but for
my own sake for the sake of the dark
world-even for the sake of the rebels-i
warn you do not go to caer llyr no matter
what medea asks or promises at least be
wary till you have your memories back
what is llyr i said again

matholch swung around his back
to me ghast rhymi knows i think
i do not nor do i want to llyr is-is evil-
and is hungry always but what feeds his
appetite is-is- he stopped

 you have forgotten he went on after a
while one thing i wonder have you for-
gotten how to summon llyr

  i did not answer there was a darkness in
my mind an ebon gate against which my
questioning thoughts probed vainly

 llyr-llyr

 matholch cast a handful of powdery sub-
stance into the glowing brazier

 can you summon llyr he asked again
his voice soft answer ganelon can you
the sour smoke-stench grew stronger the
darkness in my head sprang apart riven as
though a gateway had opened in the shadow
i-recognized that deadly perfume

  i stood up glaring at matholch i took two
steps thrust out my sandaled foot and over-
turned the brazier embers scattered on the
stone floor the red-beard turned a startled
face to me

 i reached out gripped matholchs tunic
and shook him till his teeth rattled together
hot fury filled me-and something more

  that matholch should try his tricks on me
a stranger had my longue i heard myself
speaking

 save your spells for the slaves and
helots i snarled i tell you what i wish
to tell you-no more than that burn your
filthy herbs elsewhere not in my presence
red-bearded jaw jutted yellow eyes
flamed matholchs face altered flesh flow-
ing like water dimly seen in the smoke-

clouds that poured up from the scattered
embers

  yellow tusks threatened me through the
gray mists

  the shape-changer made a wordless noise
in his throat-the guttural sound a beast
might make wolf-cry a wolf mask glared
into mine

 the smoke swam away the illusion-
illusion-was gone matholch his face re-
laxing from its snarling lines pulled gently
free from my grip

  you-startled me lord ganelon he said
smoothly but i think that i have had a
question answered whether or not these
herbs- he nodded toward the overturned
brazier -had anything to do with it

  i turned toward the doorway

  wait matholch said i took something
from you a while ago

   stopped

 the red-beard came toward me holding
out a weapon-a bared sword

 i took this from you when we passed
through the need-fire he said it is
yours

  i accepted the blade

  again i moved toward the curtained arch-
way

  behind me matholch spoke

 we are not enemies yet ganelon he
said gently and if you are wise you will
not forget my warning do not go to caer
llyr

  i went out holding the sword i hurried
down the winding stairway my feet found
their path without conscious guidance the
-intruder-in my brain was still strong a
palimpsest and the blurred erased writing
was becoming visible as though treated with
some strong chemical

  the writing that was my lost memory

 the castle-how did i know it was a
castle-was a labyrinth twice i passed
silent soldiers standing guard with a familiar
shadow of fear in their eyes-a shadow that
i thought deepened as they saw me

  i went on hurrying along a pale-amber
hallway i brushed aside a golden curtain
and stepped into an oval room dome-ceil-
inged walled with pale silken draperies a
fountain spurted its spray cool on my cheek
across the chamber an archway showed the
outlines of leafy branches beyond

  i went on through the arch i stepped out
into a walled garden a garden of exotic
flowers and bizarre trees
	startling stories

  the blooms were a riot of patternless
color like glowing jewels against the dark
earth ruby and amethyst crystal-clear and
milky white silver and gold and emerald
the flowers made a motionless carpet but
the trees were not motionless

  twisted and gnarled as oaks their black
boles and branches were veiled by a luxuri-
ant cloud of leafage virulent green

  a stir of movement rippled through that
green curtain the trees roused to aware-
ness

  i saw the black branches twist and writhe
slowly-

satisfied their vigilance relaxed they
were motionless again they-knew me

  beyond that evil orchard the dark sky
made the glowing ember of the sun more
brilliant by contrast

  the trees stirred again

  ripples of unrest shook the green a ser-
pentine limb trailing a veil of leaves lashed
out-struck-whipped back into place

  where it had been a darting shape ran
forward ducking and twisting as the guard-
ian trees struck savagely at it

  a man in a tight-fitting suit of earth-
brown and forest-green came running to-
ward me his feet trampling the jewel-flowers
his hard reckless face was alight with ex-
citement and a kind of triumph he was
empty-handed but a pistol-like weapon of
some sort swung at his belt

  edward he said urgently yet keeping
his voice low edward bond

  i knew him or i knew him for what he
was i had seen dodging furtive green-clad
figures like his before and an anger already
familiar surged over me at the very sight of
him

  enemy upstart one of the many who
had dared work their magic upon the great
lord ganelon

  i felt the heat of rage suffuse my face
and the blood rang in my ears with this un-
familiar yet well-known fury my body
stiffened in the posture of ganelon-shoul-
ders back lip curled chin high i heard
myself curse the fellow in a voice that was
choked and a language i scarcely remem-
bered and i saw him draw back disbelief
vivid upon his face his hand dropped to his
belt

  ganelon he faltered his eyes narrow
as they searched mine edward are you
with us or are you ganelon again

          chapter v
          scarlet witch

  i ripped in my right hand i still held
the sword i cut at him savagely by
way of answer he sprang back glanced
once over his shoulder and drew his weapon
i followed his glance and saw another green
figure dodging forward among the trees it
was smaller and slenderer-a girl in a tunic
the color of earth and forest her black hair
swung upon her shoulders she was tugging
at her belt as she ran and the face she
turned to me was ugly with hate her teeth
showing in a snarl

  the man before me was saying something

  edward listen to me he was crying
even if youre ganelon you remember ed-
ward bond he was with us-he believed in
us give us a hearing before its too late
arles could convince you edward come
to arles even if youre ganelon let me
take you to arles

  its no use ertu the voice of the girl
cried thinly she was struggling with the
last of the trees whose flexible bough-tips
still clutched to stop her neither of them
tried now to keep their voices down they
were shouting and i knew they must rouse
the guards at any moment and i wanted to
kill them both myself before anyone came
to forestall me by accident i was hungry
and thirsty for the blood of these enemies
and in that moment the name of edward
bond was not even a memory

  kill him ertu cried the girl kill him
or stand out of the way i know ganelon

  i looked at her and took a fresh grip on
my sword yes she spoke the truth she
knew ganelon and ganelon knew her and
remembered dimly that she had reason for
her hate i had seen that face before con-
torted with fury and despair i could not
recall when or where or why but she looked
familiar

  the man ertu drew his weapon reluctantly
to him i was still at least the image of a
friend i laughed exultantly and swung at
him again with the sword hearing it hiss
viciously through the air this time i drew
blood he stepped back again lifting his
weapon so that i looked down its black
barrel

  dont make me do it he said between his
the dark world	

teeth this will pass you have been ed-
ward bond-you will be again dont make
me kill you ganelon

  i lifted the sword seeing him only dimly
through a ruddy haze of anger there was a
great exultation in me i could already see
the fountain of blood that would leap from
his severed arteries when my blade com-
pleted its swing

 i braced my body for that great full-
armed blow

 and the sword came alive in my hand it
leaped and shuddered against my fist

 impossibly-in a way i cannot describe-
that blow reversed itself all the energy i
was braced to expend upon my enemy re-
coiled up the sword up my arm crashed
against my own body a violent explosion
of pain and shock sent the garden reeling
the earth struck hard against my knees

 mist cleared from my eyes i was still
ganelon but a ganelon dizzy from some-
thing more powerful than a blow

 i was kneeling on the grass braced with
one hand shaking the throbbing fingers of
my sword-hand and staring at the sword
that lay a dozen feet away still faintly glow-
ing

 it was matholchs doing-i knew that i
should have remembered how little i could
trust that shifting unstable wolfling i had
laid hands upon him in his tower-room-i
should have known he would have his re-
venge for that even edward bond-soft
fool that he was-would have been wise
enough not to accept a gift from the shape-
changer

 there was no time now for anger at
matholch though i was looking up into
ertus eyes and into the muzzle of his
weapon and a look of decision grew slowly
in his face as he scanned mine

 ganelon he said almost whispering
warlock

  he tilted the weapon down at me his fin-
ger moving on the trigger

 wait ertu cried a thin voice behind
him wait-let me

  i looked up still dazed it had all hap-
pened so quickly that the girl was still strug-
gling in the edge of the trees though she
cleared them as i looked and lifted her own
weapon behind it her face was white and
blazing with relentless hate let me she
cried again he owes me this

 i was helpless i knew that even at this
distance she would not miss i saw the glare

of fury in her eyes and i saw the muzzle
waver a little as her hand shook with rage
but i knew she would not miss me i thought
of a great many things in that instant-con-
fused memories of ganelons and of edward
bonds surged together through my mind

  then a great hissing like a wind swept up
among the trees behind the girl they all
swayed toward her more swiftly than trees
have any right to move stooping and strain-
ing and hissing with a dreadful vicious
avidity ertu shouted something inarticulate
but i think the girl was too angry to hear
or see

  she never knew what happened she could
only have felt the great bone-cracking sweep
of the nearest branch reaching out for her
from the leaning tree she fired as the blow
struck her and a white-hot bolt ploughed up
the turf at my knee i could smell the char-
ring grass

the girl screamed thinly once as the avid
boughs writhed together over her the
limbs threshed about her in a furious welter
and i heard one clear and distinct snap-a
sound i had heard before i knew in this
garden the human spine is no more than a
twig in the grip of those mighty boughs

  ertu was stunned for one brief instant
then he whirled to me and this time i knew
his finger would not hesitate on the trigger

  but time had run out for the two woods-
people he was not fully turned when there
came a laugh cool and amused from behind
me i saw loathing and hatred flash across
ertus bronzed face and the weapon whirled
away from me and pointed toward someone
at my back but before he could press the
trigger something like an arrow of white
light sprang over my shoulder and struck
him above the heart

  he dropped instantly his mouth frozen in
a snarling square his eyes staring

  i turned getting slowly to my feet medea
stood there smiling very slim and lovely in a
close-fitting scarlet gown in her hand was a
small black rod still raised her purple eyes
met mine

  ganelon she murmured in an infinitely
caressing voice ganelon and still holding
my gaze with hers she clapped her hands
softly

  silent swift-moving guardsmen came and
lifted the motionless body of ertu they
carried him away the trees stirred whis-
pered-and fell silent
	startling stories

  you have remembered medea said
ganelon is ours again do you remember
me-lord ganelon

  medea witch of colchis black and white
and crimson she stood there smiling at me
her strange loveliness stirring old forgotten
memories in my blood no man who had
known medea could ever forget her wholly
not till time ended

  but wait there was something more about
medea that i must remember something
that made even ganelon a little doubtful a
little cautious ganelon was i ganelon
again i had been wholly my old self when
the woodspeople stood before me but now i
was uncertain

  the memories ebbed while the lovely
witch stood smiling at me not guessing all
that had made me so briefly ganelon dropped
from my mind and body like a discarded
cloak edward bond stood there in my
clothing staring about the clearing and re-
membering with dismay and sick revulsion
what had just been happening here

  for a moment i turned away to hide from
medea what my face must betray if she saw
it i felt dizzy with more than memory the
knowledge that two identities shared my body
was a thought even more disturbing than the
memory of what i had just done in the grip
of ganelons strong evil will

  this was ganelons body there could be
no doubt of it now somewhere on earth
edward bond was back in his old place
but the patterns of his memory still over-
laid my mind so that he and i shared a
common soul and there was no ganelon
except briefly in snatches as the memoines
that were rightfully mine-mine-returned
to crowd out edward bond

  i hated ganelon i rejected all he thought
and was my false memories the heritage
from edward bond were stronger in me than
ganelon i was edward bond-now

  medeas caressing voice broke in upon my
conflict echoing her question

  do you remember me lord ganelon

  i turned to her feeling the bewilderment
on my own face so that my very thoughts
were blurred

  my name is bond i told her stubbornly

  she sighed

  you will come back she said it will
take time but ganelon will return to us as
you see familiar things again the life of the
dark world the life of the coven the doors
of your mind will open once more you will

remember a little more tonight i think at
the sabbat her red smile was suddenly al-
most frightening

  not since i went into the earth-world
has a sabbat been held and it is long past
time she went on for in caer llyr there
is one who stirs and grows hungry for his
sacrifice

  she looked at me piercingly the purple
eyes narrowing

  do you remember caer llyr ganelon

  the old sickness and horror came over me
as she repeated that cryptic name

  llyr-llyr darkness and something stir-
ring beyond a golden window something
too alien to touch the soil that human feet
touched something that should never share
the same life humans lived touching that
soil sharing that life it defiled them so that
they were no longer fit for humans to share
and yet despite my revulsion llyr was
terribly intimate too

  i knew i remembered-

  i remember nothing i told her shortly
for in that particular moment caution was
bom in me i could not trust anyone not
even myself least of all ganelon-myself
i did remember but i must not let them
know until i was clearer as to what they
wanted what they threatened i must keep
this one secret which was all the weapon i
had

llyr the thought of him-of it-crys-
tallized that decision in my mind for
somewhere in the murk of ganelons past
there was a frightening link with llyr i
knew they were trying to push me into that
abyss of oneness with llyr and i sensed that
even ganelon feared that i must pretend to
be more ignorant than i really was until the
thing grew clearer in my memory

  i shook my head again i remember
nothing

  not even medea she whispered and
swayed toward me there was sorcery about
her my arms received that red and white
softness as if they were ganelons arms not
mine but it was edward bonds lips which
responded to the fierce pressure of her lips

  not even medea

  edward bond or ganelon what was it to
me then the moment was enough

  but the touch of the red witch wrought a
change in edward bond it brought a sense
of strangeness of utter strangeness to him-
to me i held her lovely yielding body in my
tiie dark world	

arms but something alien and unknown
stooped and hovered above me as we touched
i surmised that she was holding herself in
check-restraining a-a demon that pos-
sessed her-a demon that fought to free it-
self

 ganelon

 trembling she pressed her palms against
my chest and thrust free tiny droplets stood
on her pale forehead

 enough she whispered you know

 what medea

 and now stark horror stood in those pur-
ple eyes

 you have forgotten she said you
have forgotten me forgotten who i am what
i am

chapter vi
the ride to caer secaire

later in the apartments that had been
ganelons i waited for the hour of
sabbat and as i waited i paced the floor
restlessly ganelons feet pacing ganelons
floor but the man who walked here was
edward bond amazing i thought how the
false memory-pattems of another person
impressed upon ganelons clean-sponged
brain had changed him from himself to-me

 i wondered if i would ever be sure again
which personality was myself i hated and
distrusted ganelon now but i knew how
easily the old self slipped back in which i
would despise edward bond

  and yet to save myself i must call back
ganelons memories i must know more than
those around me guessed i knew or i thought
ganelon and bond together might be lost
medea would tell me nothing edeym would
tell me nothing matholch might tell me
much but he would be lying

 i scarcely dared go with them to this
sabbat which i thought would be the sabbat
of llyr because of that strange and terrible
link between llyr and myself there would
be sacrifices

 how could i be sure i myself was not
destined for the altar before that-that gold-
en window

 then for a brief but timeless moment
ganelon came back remembering f ragmen -
tary things that flitted through my mind too
swiftly to take shape i caught only terror-

terror and revulsion and a hideous hopeless
longing   

  dared i attend the sabbat

  but i dared not fail to attend for if i re-
fused i must admit i knew more about what
threatened ganelon than edward bond
should know and my only frail weapon
against them now was what little i recalled
that was secret from them i must go even
if the altar waited me i must go

  there were the woodspeople they were
outlaws hunted through the forests by coven
soldiers capture meant enslavement-i re-
membered the look of still horror in the eyes
of those living dead men who were medeas
servants as edward bond i pitied them
wondered if i could do anything to save them
from the coven the real edward bond had
been living among them for a year and a
half organizing resistance fighting the coven
on earth i knew he must be raging help-
lessly now haunted by the knowledge of
work unfinished and friends abandoned to
the mercies of dark magic

  perhaps i should seek the woodspeople out
among them at least i would be safe while
my memories returned but when they re-
turned-why then ganelon would rage run-
ning amuck among them mad with his own
fury and arrogance dared i subject the
woodspeople to the danger that would be the
lord ganelon when ganelons memories
came back dared i subject myself to their
vengeance for they would be many against
one

  i could not go and i could not stay there
was safety nowhere for the edward bond
who might become ganelon at any moment
there was danger everywhere from the
rebel woodspeople from every member of
this coven

  it might come through the wild and mock-
ing matholch

  or through edeyrn who had watched me
unseen with her chilling gaze in the shadows
of her cowl

  through ghast rhymi whoever he was
through arles or through the red witch

  yes most of all i thought through medea
-medea whom i loved

  at dusk two maidens-helot-servants-
came bringing food and a change of gar-
ments i ate hurriedly dressed in the plain
fine-textured tunic and shorts and drew
about me the royal blue cloak they had car-
ried a mask of golden cloth i dangled un-
decidedly until one of the maidens spoke
startling stories



  we are to guide you when you are ready
lord she reminded me

  im ready now i said and followed the
pair

  a pale concealed lighting system of some
sort made the hallways bright i was taken
to medeas apartment with its singing foun-
tain under the high dome the red witch
was there breathtakingly lovely in a clinging
robe of pure white above the robe her
naked shoulders gleamed smoothly she
wore a scarlet cloak i wore a blue one

  the helots slipped away medea smiled at
me but i noticed a wire-taut tenseness about
her betrayingly visible at the corners of her
lips and in her eyes a pulse of expectation
seemed to beat out from her

  are you ready ganelon

  i dont know i said it depends i
suppose dont forget that my memorys
gone

  it may return tonight some of it any-
way she said but you will take no part
in the ritual at least until after the sacrifice
it will be better if you merely watch since
you do not remember the rites youd best
leave those to the rest of the coven

  matholch

  and edeyrn medea said ghast rhymi
will not come he never leaves this castle
nor will he unless the need is very great he
is old too old

i frowned at the red witch where
are we going i asked

  to caer secaire i told you there has been
no sacrifice since i went to earth-world to
search for you it is past time

  what am i supposed to do

  she put out a slender hand and touched
mine

  nothing till the moment comes you will
know then but meantime you must watch-
no more than that put on your mask now

  she slipped on a small black mask that
left the lower half of her face visible

 i donned the golden mask i followed
medea to a curtained archway and through
it

  we were in a courtyard two horses stood
waiting held by grooms medea mounted one
and i the other

 overhead the sky had darkened a huge
door lifted in the wall beyond a roadway
stretched toward the distant forest

  the somber angry disc of the red sun
gwollen and burning with a dull fire touched

the crest of the mountain barrier

  swiftly it sank darkness came across the
sky with a swooping rush a million points
of white light became visible in the faint
starshine medeas face was ghost-pale

 through the near-darkness her eyes
glowed

  faintly and from far away i heard a thin
trumpeting call it was repeated

  then silence-and a whispering that rose
to a rhythmic thudding of shod hoofs

  past us moved a figure a helot guardsman
unmasked unspeaking his gaze turned to the
waiting gateway

 then another-and another until three
score of soldiers had gone past and after
them nearly three score of maidens-the
slave-girls

  on a light swift-looking roan stallion
matholch came by stealing a glance at me
from his yellow eyes a cloak of forest
green swirled from his shoulders

  behind him the tiny form of edeyrn on a
pony suited to her smallness she was still
cowled her face hidden but she now wore a
cloak of purest yellow

 medea nodded at me we touched our
heels to the horses flanks and took our
places in the column behind us other figures
rode but i could not see them clearly it
was too dark

  through the gateway in the wall we went
still in silence save for the clopping of hoofs
we rode across the plain the edges of the
forest reached out toward us and swallowed
us

 i glanced behind an enormous bulk
against the sky showed the castle i had left

  we rode under heavy drooping branches
these were not the black trees of medeas
garden but they were not normal either i
could not tell why an indefinable sense of
strangeness reached out at me from the dim
shadows above and around us

  after a long time the ground dipped at our
feet and we saw below us the roads end
the moon had risen belatedly by its yellow
glare there materialized from the deep valley
below us a sort of tower a dark windowless
structure almost gothic in plan as though it
had thrust itself from the black earth from
the dark grove of ancient and alien trees

  caer secaire

  i had been here before ganelon of the
dark world knew this spot well but i did
not know it i sensed only that unpleasant
familiarity the deja vu phenomenon known
the dark world	

to all psychologists coupled with a curious
depersonalization as though my own body
my mind my very soul felt altered and
strange

 caer secaire scaire somewhere in my
studies i had encountered that name an
ancient rite in-in gascony that was it

 the mass of saint secaire

 and the man for whom that black mass
is said-dies that too i remembered was
the mass to be said for ganelon tonight

 this was not the place of llyr somehow
i knew that caer llyr was elsewhere and
otherwise not a temple not a place visited
by worshipers but here in caer secaire as
in other temples throughout the dark land
llyr might be summoned to his feasting and
summoned would come

 would ganelon be his feast tonight i
clenched the reins with nervous hands there
was some tension in the air that i could not
quite understand medea was calm beside
me edeym was always calm matholch i
could swear had nothing to take the place of
nerves yet in the night there was tension
as if it breathed upon us from the dark trees
along the roadside

 before us in a silent submissive flock the
soldiers and the slave-girls went some of
the soldiers were armed they seemed to be
herding the rest their movements mechanical
as if whatever had once made them free-
willed humans was now asleep i knew with-
out being told the purpose for which those
men and maidens were being driven toward
caer secaire but not even these voiceless
mindless victims were tense they went
blindly to their doom no the tension came
from the dark around us

 someone something waiting in the night

chapter vii
men of the forest

from out of the dark woods suddenly
startlingly a trumpet-note rang upon the
air in the same instant there was a wild
crashing in the underbrush an outburst of
shouts and cries and the night was laced by
the thin lightnings of unfamiliar gunfire the
road was suddenly thronging with green-clad
figures who swarmed about the column of
slaves ahead of us grappling with the guards
losing in between us and the mindless vic-

tims at our forefront

  my horse reared wildly i fought him hard
forcing him down again while stirrings of
the old red rage i had felt before mounted
in my brain ganelon at sight of the forest
people struggled to take control him too i
fought even in my surprise and bewilder-
ment i saw in this interruption the possibility
of succor i cracked my rearing horse be-
tween the ears with clubbed rein-loops and
struggled to keep my balance

  beside me medea had risen in her stirrups
and was sending bolt after arrowy bolt into
the green melee ahead of us the dark rod
that was her weapon leaping in her hand with
every shot edeyrn had drawn aside taking
no part in the fight her small cowled figure
sat crouching in the saddle but her very
stillness was alarming i had the feeling she
could end the combat in a moment if she
chose

  as for matholch his saddle was empty
his horse was already crashing away through
the woods and matholch had hurled himself
headlong into the fight snarling joyously
the sound sent cold shudders down my
spine i could see that his green cloak cov-
ered a shape that was not wholly manlike
and the green people veered away from him
as he plunged through their throngs toward
the head of the column

 the woodsfolk were trying a desperate
rescue i realized that immediately i saw
too that they dared not attack the coven
itself all their efforts were aimed at over-
powering the robotlike guards so that the
equally robotlike victims might be saved from
llyr and i could see that they were failing

 for the victims were too apathetic to
scatter all will had long ago been drained
away from them they obeyed orders-that
was all and the forest people were leader-
less in a moment or two i realized that and
knew why it was my fault edward bond
may have planned this daring raid but
through my doing he was not here to guide
them and already the abortive fight was
nearly over

  medeas flying fiery arrows struck down
man after man the mindless guards fired
stolidly into the swarms that surged about
them and matholchs deep-throated exultant
snarling yells as he fought his way toward
his soldiers were more potent than weapons
the raiders shrank back from the sound as
they did not shrink from gunfire in a mo-
ment i knew matholch would reach his men
	startling stories

and organized resistance would break the
back of this unguided mutiny

  for an instant my own mind was a fierce
battle-ground ganelon struggled to take
control and edward bond resisted him
savagely

  as ganelon i knew my place was beside
the wolfling every instinct urged me for-
ward to his side but edward bond knew
better edward bond too knew where his
rightful place should be

  i shoved up my golden mask so that my
face was visible i drove my heels into my
horses sides and urged him headlong down
the road beliind matholch the sheer weight
of the horse gave me an advantage matholch
afoot did not have the sound of drumming
hoofs and the lunging shoulders of my mount
opened a way for me i rose in the stirrups
and shouted with ganelons deep carrying
roar

  bond bond edward bond

  the rebels heard me for an instant the
battle around the column wavered as every
green-clad man paused to look back then
they saw their lost leader and a great echo-
ing hail swept their ranks

  bond edward bond

  the forest rang with it and there was new
courage in the sound matholchs wild snarl
of rage was drowned in the roar of the forest
men as they surged forward again to the
attack

  out of ganelons memories i knew what i
must do the foresters were dragging down
guard after guard careless of the gunfire
that mowed their disordered ranks but only
i could save the prisoners only ganelons
voice could pierce the daze that held them

  i kicked my frantic horse forward knock-
ing guards left and right and gained the
head of the column

  in the forest i shouted waken and
rim run hard

  there was an instant forward surge as the
slaves still tranced in their dreadful dream
but obedient to the voice of a coven member
lurched through the thin rank of their guard
the whole shape of the struggle changed as
the core of it streamed irresistibly forward
across the road and into the darkness of the
woods

  the green-clad attackers fell back to let the
slaves through it was a strange voiceless
flight they made not even the guards
shouted though they fired and fired again
upon the retreating column their faces as

blank as if they slept without dreams

  my flesh crawled as i watched that sight-
the men and women fleeing for their lives
the armed soldiers shooting them down and
the faces of them all utterly without expres-
sion voiceless they ran and voiceless they
died when the gun-bolts found them

  i wrenched my horse around and kicked
him in the wake of the fleeing column my
golden mask slipped sidewise and i tore it
off waving to the scattering foresters the
moonlight catching brightly on its gold

  save yourselves i shouted scatter and
follow me

  behind me i heard matholchs deep snarl
very near i glanced over one shoulder as
my horse plunged across the road the
shape-changers tall figure faced me across
the heads of several of his soldiers his face
was a wolf-like snarling mask and as i
looked he lifted a dark rod like the one
medea had been using i saw the arrow of
white fire leap from it and ducked in the
saddle

  the movement saved me i felt a strong
tug at my shoulders where the blue cape
swirled out and heard the tear of fabric as
the bolt ripped through it and plunged hissing
into the dark beyond my horse lunged on
into the woods

  then the trees were rustling all about me
and my bewildered horse stumbled and
tossed up his head whinnying in terror
beside me in the dark a soft voice spoke
softly

  this way it said and a hand seized the
bridle

  i let the woodsmen lead me into the dark-
ness

  it was jugt dawn when our weary column
came at last to the end of the journey to the
valley between cliffs where the woodsmen
had established their stronghold all of us
were tired though the blank-faced slaves we
had rescued trudged on in an irregular col-
umn behind me unaware that their feet were
tom and their bodies drooping with ex-
haustion

  the forest men slipped through the trees
around us alert for followers we had no
wounded with us the bolts the coven shot
never wounded whoever was struck fell
dead in his tracks

  in the pale dawn i would not have known
the valley before me for the headquarters
of a populous clan it looked quite empty
except for scattered boulders mossy slopes
the dark world	

and a small stream that trickled down the
middle pink in the light of sunrise

one of the men took my horse then and
we went on foot up the valley the
robot slaves crowding behind we seemed to
be advancing up an empty valley but when
we had gone half its length suddenly the
woodsman at my right laid his hand upon my
arm and we paused the rabble behind us
jostling together without a murmur around
me the woodsmen laughed softly i looked
up

 she stood high upon a boulder that over-
hung the stream she was dressed like a
man in a tunic of soft velvety green cross-
belted with a weapon swinging at each hip
but her hair was a fabulous mantle stream-
ing down over her shoulders and hanging
almost to her knees in a cascade of pale gold
that rippled like water a crown of pale
gold leaves the color of the hair held it
away from her face and under the shining
chaplet she looked down and smiled at us
especially she smiled at me-at edward
bond

 and her face was very lovely it had the
strength and innocence and calm serenity of
a saints face but there was warmth and
humor in the red lips her eyes were the
same color as her tunic deep green a color
i had never seen before in my own world

 welcome back edward bond she said
in a clear sweet gently hushed voice as if
she had spoken softly for so many years that
even now she did not dare speak aloud

 she jumped down from the boulder very
lightly moving with the sureness of a wild
creature that had lived all its lifetime in the
woods as indeed i suppose she had her
hair floated about her as lightly as a web
settling only slowly about her shoulders as
she came forward so that she seemed to
walk in a halo of her own pale gold

 i remembered what the woodsman ertu
had said to me in medeas garden before her
arrow struck him down

 arles could convince you edward even
if youre ganelon let me take you to arles

 i stood before arles now of that i was
sure and if i had needed any conviction
before that the woodsmens cause was mine
this haloed girl would have convinced me
with her first words but as for ganelon-

 how could i know what ganelon would
do

 that question was answered for me be-

fore my lips could frame words before i
could plan my next reaction arles came to-
ward me utterly without pretense or con-
sciousness of the watching eyes she put her
hands on my shoulders and kissed me on the
mouth

  and that was not like medeas kiss-no
arles lips were cool and sweet not warm
with the dangerous alluring honey-musk of
the red witch that intoxication of strange
passion i remembered when i had held medea
in my arms did not sweep me now there
was a-a purity about arles an honesty that
made me suddenly horribly homesick for
earth

  she drew back her moss-green eyes met
mine with quiet understanding she seemed
to be waiting

  arles i said after a moment

  and that seemed to satisfy her the vague
question that had begun to show on her face
was gone

  i wondered she said they didnt hurt
you edward

  instinctively i knew what i had to say

  no we hadnt reached caer secaire if
the woodsmen hadnt attacked-well thered
have been a sacrifice

  arles reached out and lifted a corner of
my torn cloak her slim fingers light on the
silken fabric

  the blue robe she said yes that is
the color the sacrifice wears the gods cast
their dice on our side tonight edward now
as for this foul thing we must get rid of it

  her green eyes blazed she ripped the
cloak from me tore it across and dropped it
to the ground

  you will not go hunting again alone
she added i told you it was dangerous
but you laughed at me ill wager you didnt
laugh when the coven slaves caught you
or was that the way of it

  i nodded a slow deep fury was rising
within me so blue was the color of sacrifice
was it my fears hadnt been groundless
at caer secaire i would have been the offer-
ing going blindly to my doom matholch
had known of course trust his wolf-mind
to appreciate the joke edeyrn thinking her
tool inhuman thoughts in the shadow of her
hood she had known too and medea

  medea

  she had dared betray me me ganelon

  the opener of the gate the chosen of
llyr the great lord ganelon they dared

  black thunder roared through my brain
	startling stories

i thought by llyr but theyll suffer for
this theyll crawl to my feet like dogs
begging my mercy

  rage had opened the floodgates and ed-
ward bond was no more than a set of thin
memories that slipped from me as the blue
cloak had slipped from my shoulders-the
blue cloak of the chosen sacrifice on the
shoulders of the lord ganelon

 blinked blindly around the green-clad
circle how had i come here how
dared these woodsrunners stand in defiance
before me blood roared in my ears and the
woodland swam around me when it steadied
i would draw my weapon and reap these
upstarts as a mower reaps his wheat

  but wait

  first the coven my sworn comrades had
betrayed me why why they had been
glad enough to see me when they brought
me back from the other world the alien land
of earth the woodsmen i could slay when-
ever i wished it-the other problem came
first and ganelon was a wise man i might
need these woods-people to help me in my
vengeance afterward-ah afterward

  i strove hard with memory what could
have happened to turn the coven against me
i could have sworn this had not been medeas
original intention-she had welcomed me
back too sincerely for that matholch could
have influenced her but again why why
or perhaps it was edeyrn or the old one
himself ghast rhymi in any case by the
golden window that opens on the abyss
theyd learn their error

 edward a womans voice sweet and
frightened came to me as if from a great
distance i fought my way up through a
whirlpool of fury and hatred i saw a pale
face haloed in floating hair the green eyes
troubled i remembered

  beside arles stood a stranger a man whose
cold gray eyes upon mine provided the shock
i needed to bring me back to sanity he
looked at me as if he knew me-knew gane-
lon i had never seen the man before

  he was short and sturdy young-looking
in spite of the gray flecks in his close-cropped
beard his face was tanned so deeply it
had almost the color of the brown earth in
his close-fitting green suit he was the perfect
personification of a woodrunner a glider
through the forest unseen and dangerous
watching the powerful flex of his muscles
when he moved i knew he would be a bad

antagonist and there was deep antagonism
in the way he looked at me

 a white jagged scar had knotted his right
 cheek quirking up his thin mouth so that
 he wore a perpetual crooked sardonic half-
 grin there was no laughter in those gelid
 gray eyes though

 and i saw that the circle of woodsmen had
 drawn back ringing us watching

the bearded man put out his arm and
swept arles behind him unarmed he
stepped forward toward me

no lorryn arles cried dont hurt
him

 lorryn thrust his face into mine

 ganelon he said

and at the name a whisper of fear of
hatred murmured around the circle of
woodsfolk i saw furtive movements hands
slipping quietly toward the hilts of weapons
i saw arles face change

the old-time cunning of ganelon came to
my aid

no i said rubbing my forehead im
bond all right it was that drug the coven
gave me its still working

what drug

 i dont know i told lorryn it was in
 medeas wine that i drank and the long
 journey tonight has tired me

i took a few unsteady paces aside and
leaned against the boulder shaking my head
as though to clear it but my ears were alert
the low murmur of suspicion was dying

 cool fingers touched mine

 oh my dear arles said and whirled on
 lorryn do you think i dont know edward
 bond from ganelon lorryn youre a fool

 if the two werent identical wed never
 have switched them in the first place lor-
 ryn said roughly be sure arles very
 sure

now the whispering grew again better
to be sure the woodsmen murmured no
risks arles if this is ganelon he must die

the doubt came back into arles green
eyes she thrust my hands away and stared
at me and the doubt did not fade

 i gave her glance for glance

 well arles i said

 her lips quivered

 it cant be i know but lorryn is right
 you know that we can take no risks to
 have the devil ganelon back after all thats
 happened would be disastrous

 devil i thought the devil ganelon gan-
 elon had hated the woodsfolk yes but
the dark world	

now he had another greater hatred in his
hour of weakness the coven had betrayed
him the woodsfolk could wait vengeance
could not it would be the devil ganelon
who would bring caer secaire and the castle
crashing down about the ears of the coven

 which would mean playing a careful
game

  yes lorryn is right i said youve no
way of knowing im not ganelon perhaps
you know it arles- i smiled at her -but
there must be no chances taken let lorryn
test me

  well lorryn said looking at arles

 doubtfully she glanced from me to the
bearded man

  -very well i suppose

 lorryn barked laughter

  my tests might fail but there is one who
can see the truth freydis

  let freydis test me i said quickly and
was rewarded by seeing lorryn hesitate

  very well he said at last if im wrong
ill apologize now but if im right ill kill
you or try to theres only one other life
id enjoy taking the more and the shape-
changer isnt in my reach-yet

again lorryn touched h i s scarred
cheek at the thought of lord math-
olch warmth came into his gray eyes a dis-
tant ember burned for an instant there i
had seen hatred before but not often had i
seen such hatred as lorryn held for-the
wolfling

  well let him kill matholch if he could
there was another softer throat in which i
wanted to sink my fingers nor could all her
magic protect the red witch when ganelon
came back to caer secaire and broke the
coven like rotten twigs in his hands

 again the black rage thundered up like
a deluging tide that fury had wiped out
edward bond-but it had not wiped out
ganelons cunning

 as you like lorryn i said quietly
lets go to freydis now

 he nodded shortly lorryn on one side
of me arles puzzled and troubled on the
other we moved up the valley surrounded
by the woodsfolk the dazed slaves surged
ahead

 the canyon walls closed in a cave-mouth
showed in the granite ahead

 we drew up in a rough semi-circle facing
that cavern silence fell broken by the
whispering of leaves in the wind the red

 sun was rising over the mountain wall

 out of the darkness came a voice deep
 resonant powerful

 i am awake it said what is your
 need

 mother freydis we have helots captured
 from the coven arles said quickly the
 sleep is on them

 send them in to me

 lorryn gave arles an angry look he
 pushed forward

 mother freydis he called

 i hear

 we need your sight this man edward
 bond-i think he is ganelon come back from
 the earth-world where you sent him

 there was a long pause

 send him into me the deep voice finally
 said but first the helots

 at a signal from lorryn the woodsfolk
 began herding the slaves toward the cave-
 mouth they made no resistance empty-
 eyed they trooped toward that cryptic dark-
 ness and one by one vanished

 lorryn looked at me and jerked his head
 toward the cavern i smiled

 when i come out we shall be friends
 again as before i said

 his eyes did not soften

 freydis must decide that

 i turned to arles

 freydis shall decide i said but there
 is nothing to fear arles remember that
 i am not ganelon

 she watched me afraid unsure as i
 stepped back a pace or two

 the silent throng of woodsfolk stared wait-
 ing warily they had their weapons ready

 i laughed softly and turned

 i walked toward the cave-mouth

 the blackness swallowed me

chapter viii

freydis

 strange to relate i felt sure of myself
 as i walked up the sloping ramp in the
 darkness ahead of me around a bend i
 could see the glimmer of firelight and i
 smiled it had been difficult to speak with
 these upstart woodrunners as if they were
 my equals as if i were still edward bond
 it would be difficult to talk to their witch-
	startling stories

 woman as if she had as much knowledge as
 a lord of the coven some she must have
 or she could never have managed the transfer
 which had sent me into the earth-world and
 brought out edward bond but i thought i
 could deceive her or anyone these rebels had
 to offer me

  the small cave at the turn of the corridor
was empty except for freydis her back was
to me she crouched on her knees before a
small fire that burned apparently without
fuel in a dish of crystal she wore a white
robe and her white hair lay in two heavy
braids along her back i stopped trying to
feel like edward bond again to determine
what he would have said in this moment
then freydis turned and rose

  she rose tremendously few in the dark
world can look me in the eye but freydis
clear blue gaze was level with my own her
great shoulders and great smooth arms were
as powerful as a mans and if age was upon
her it did not show in her easy motions or
in the timeless face she turned to me only
in the eyes was knowledge mirrored and i
knew as i met them that she was old indeed

  good morning ganelon she said in her
deep serene voice

  i gaped she knew me as surely as if she
read my mind yet i was sure or nearly
sure that no one in the dark world could do
that for a moment i almost stammered
then pride came to my rescue

  good day old woman i said i come
to offer you a chance for your life if you
obey me we have a score to settle you and
i

  she smiled

  sit down covenanter she said the
last time we matched strength you traded
worlds would you like to visit earth again
lord ganelon

  it was my turn to laugh

 you could not and if you could you
wouldnt after you hear me

  her blue eyes searched mine

 you want something desperately she
said in a slow voice your very presence
here offering me terms proves that i never
thought to see the lord ganelon face to face
unless he was in chains or in a berserker
battle-mood your need of me lord gane-
lon serves as chains for you now you are
fettered by your need and helpless

 she turned back to the fire and sat down
with graceful smoothness her huge body
under perfect control across the flame in its

crystal bowl she faced me

  sit down ganelon she said again and
we will bargain you and i one thing first-
do not waste my time with lies i shall know
if you tell the truth covenanter remember
it

  i shrugged

  why should i bother with lies for such as
you i said i have nothing to hide from
you the more of truth you know the
stronger youll see my case is first though-
those slaves who came in before me

  she nodded toward the back of the cave

  i sent them into the inner mountain they
sleep you know the heavy sleep that comes
upon those loosed from the spell lord gane-
lon

  i sat down shaking my head

  no-no that i can not quite remember
i-you asked for the truth old woman lis-
ten to it then i am ganelon but the false
memories of edward bond still blur my mind
as edward bond i came here-but arles
told me one thing that brought ganelon
back she told me that the coven in my
hour of weakness had dressed me in the blue
cloak of the sacrifice and i was riding for
caer secaire when the woodsmen attacked
us must i tell you now what my first wish
in life is witch-woman

  revenge on the coven she said it hol-
lowly her eyes burning into mine through
the fire this is the truth you speak coven-
anter you want my help in getting your
vengeance what can you offer the woods-
folk in return save fire and sword why
should we trust you ganelon

  her ageless eyes burned into mine

  because of what you want my desire is
vengeance yours is-what

  the end of llyr-the ruin of the coven
her voice was resonant and her whole age-
less face lighted as she spoke

  so i too desire the ruin of the coven and
the end-the end of llyr my tongue stum-
bled a little when i said that i was not sure
why true i had been sealed to llyr in a
great and terrible ceremony once-i could
recall that much but llyr and i were not
one we might have been had events run
differently i shuddered now at the thought
of it

  yes it was llyrs end i desired now-
must desire if i hoped to live

  freydis looked at me keenly she nodded

  yes-perhaps you do perhaps you do
what do you want of us then ganelon
the dark world	

spoke hastily

  i want you to swear to your people that
i am edward bond no--wait i can do more
or them now than edward bond could do
give thanks that i am ganelon again old
woman for only he can help you listen to
me your foresters could not kill me i know
that ganelon is deathless except on llyrs
altar but they could fetter me and keep me
prisoner here until you could work your
spells again and bring edward bond back
and that would be foolish for your sake and
for mine

 edward bond has done all he knows for
you now its ganelons turn who else could
tell you how llyr is vulnerable or where
matholch keeps his secret weapons or how
one can vanquish edeyrn these things i
know-or i once knew you must help me
win my memories back freydis after
that- i grinned fiercely

  she nodded then she sat quiet for awhile

 what do you want me to do then gane-
lon she astyed at last

 tell me first about the bridging of the
worlds i said eagerly how did you change
edward bond and me

  freydis smiled grimly

 not so fast covenanter she answered
i have my secrets too i will answer only a
part of that question we wrought the change
as you must guess simply to rid ourselves of
you you must remember how fiercely you
were pressing us in your raids for slaves in
your hatred of our freedom we are a proud
people ganelon and we would not be op-
pressed forever but we knew there was no
death for you except in a way we could not
use

 i knew of the twin world of earth i
searched and found edward bond and after
much striving much effort i wrought a cer-
tain transition that put you in the other
world with the memories of edward bond
blotting out your own

 we were rid of you true we had edward
bond with us and we did not trust him
either he was too like you but him we
could kill if we must we did not he is a
strong man covenanter we came to trust
him and rely upon him he brought us new
ideas of warfare he was a good leader it
was he who planned the attack upon the next
coven sacrifice-

  an attack that failed i said or would
have failed had i not swung my weight into
the balance edward bond had earth-knowl-

edge yes but his weapons and defenses
could only have breached the outer walls of
the coven you know there are powers sel-
dom used but powers that do not fail

  i know she said yes i know ganelon
yet we had to try at least and the coven
had been weakened by losing you without
you none of the others would have dared call
on llyr except perhaps ghast rhymi she
stared deeply into the fire i know you
ganelon i know the pride that burns in your
soul and i know too that vengeance now
would be very dear to your heart yet you
were sealed to llyr once and you have been
covenanter since your birth how do i know
you can be trusted

  i did not answer that and after a moment
freydis turned toward the smoke-blackened
wall she twitched aside a curtain i had not
seen there in an alcove was a symbol a
very ancient sign older than civilization
older than human speech

  yes freydis would be one of the few who
knew what that symbol meant as i knew

  now will you swear that you speak with
a straight tongue she said

  i moved my hand in the ritual gesture that
bound me irrevocably this was an oath i
could not break without being damned and
doubly damned in this world and the next
but i had no hesitation i spoke truth

  i will destroy the coven i said

  and llyr

  i will bring an end to llyr

  but sweat stood out on my forehead as i
said that it was not easy

  freydis twitched the curtain back into
place she seemed satisfied

  i have less doubt now she said well
ganelon the noms weave strange threads
together to make warp and woof of destiny
yet there is a pattern though sometimes we
cannot see it i did not ask you to swear
fealty to the forest-folk

  i realize that

  you would not have sworn it she said
nor is it necessary after the coven is
broken after an end is made to llyr i can
guard the people of the woods against even
you ganelon and we may meet in battle
then but until then we are allies i will
name you-edward bond

ill need more than that i told her if
the masquerade is to pass unchallenged
no one will doubt my word freydis said
firelight flickered on her great frame her
smooth ageless face
	startling stories

  i cannot fight the coven till i get back
my memories the memories of ganelon
all of them

he shook her head

  well she said slowly i cannot do
too much on that score something yes
but writing on the mind is touchy work and
memories once erased are not easily brought
back you still have edward bonds mem-
ories

  i nodded

  but my own no theyre fragmentary
i know for example that i was sealed to
llyr but the details i dont remember

  it would be as well perhaps to let that
memory stay lost freydis said somberly
but you are right a dulled tool is no use
so listen

  rock-still boulder-huge she stood across
the fire from me her voice deepened

  i sent you into the earth-world i
brought your double edward bond here
he helped us and-arles loved him after
a while even lorryn who does not trust
many grew to trust edward bond

  who is lorryn

  one of us now not always years ago
he had his cottage in the forest he hunted
and few were as cunning as lorryn in the
chase his wife was very young well she
died lorryn came back to his cottage one
night and found death there and blood and
a wolf that snarled at him from a bloody
muzzle he fought the wolf he did not kill
it you saw lorryns cheek his whole body
is like that scarred and wealed from wolf-
fangs

  a wolf i said not-

  a wolfling freydis said lycanthrope
shape-changer matholch some day lorryn
will kill matholch he fives only for that
let him have the red dog i said con-
temptuously if he likes ill give him mat-
holch flayed

  arles and lorryn and edward bond have
planned their campaign freydis said they
swore that the last sabbat had been cele-
brated in the dark world edward bond
showed them new weapons he remembered
from earth such weapons have been built
and are in the arsenal ready no sabbats
have been held since medea and her fol-
lowers went searching to earth the woods-
folk held their hands there was nothing to
strike at except old ghast rhymi now
medea and the rest of the coven are back

theyre ready if you lead against them
ganelon the coven can be smashed i think
the coven has its own weapons i mut-
tered my memory fails-but i think edeyrn
has a power that-that- i shook my head
no its gone

  how can llyr be destroyed freydis
asked

  i-i may have known once not now
look at me she said and leaned for-
ward so that it seemed as though her ageless
face was bathed in the fires

  through the flames her gaze caught mine
some ancient power kindled her clear blue
eyes like pools of cool water under a bright
sky-pools deep and unstirring where one
could sink into an azure silence forever and
ever   

  as i looked the blue waters clouded grew
dark i saw a great black dome against a
black sky i saw the thing that dwells deep-
est and most strongly in the mind of ganelon
-caer llyr

  the dome swam closer it loomed above
me its walls parted like dark water and
i moved in memory down the great smooth
shining corridor that leads to llyr himself

chapter ix
realm of the superconscious

onward i moved faces flickered be-
fore me-matholchs fierce grin
edeyrns cowled head with its glance that
chilled medeas savage beauty that no man
could ever forget even in his hatred they
looked at me mistrustfully their lips moved
in soundless question curiously i knew
these were real faces i saw

  in the magic of freydis spell  was drifting
through some dimensionless place where only
the mind ventures and i was meeting here
the thoughts of the questing coven meeting
the eyes of their minds they knew me
they asked me fiercely a question i could
not hear

  death was in the face matholchs mind
turned to mine all his hatred of me boiled
furiously in his yellow wolf-eyes his lips
moved-almost i could hear him medeas
features swam up before me blotting out the
shape-changer her red mouth framed a
question-over and over

  ganelon where are you ganelon mv
the dark world	

lover where are you you must come back
to us ganelon

 edeyrns faceless head moved between
medea and me and very distantly i heard
her cool small voice echoing the same
thought

  you must return to us ganelon return
to us and die

  anger drew a red curtain between those
faces and myself

  traitors betrayers false to the coven
oath how dared they threaten ganelon
the strongest of them all how dared they
-and why

 why

  my brain reeled with the query and then
i realized there was one face missing from
the coven these three had been searching
the thought-planes for me but what of ghast
rhymi

  deliberately i groped for the contact of his
mind

  i could not touch him but i remembered
i remembered ghast rhymi whose face ed-
ward bond had never seen old old old
beyond good and evil beyond fear and
hatred this was ghast rhymi the wisest of
the coven if he willed he would answer
my groping thought if he willed not noth-
ing could force him nothing could harm
the eldest for he lived on only by force of
his own will

  he could end himself instantly by the
power of a thought and he is like a candle
flame flickering away as one grasps at him
life holds nothing more for him he does
not cling to it if i had tried to seize him
he could slip like fire or water from my
grasp he would as soon be dead as alive
but unless he must he would not break his
deep calm to think the thought that would
change him into clay

  his mind and the image of his face re-
mained hidden from my quest he would not
answer the rest of the coven still kept
calling to me with a strange desperation in
their minds-return and die lord ganelon
but ghast rhymi did not care

  so i knew that it was at his command the
death-sentence had been passed and i knew
i must seek him out and somehow force an
answer from him-from ghast rhymi upon
whom all force was strengthless yet force
him i must

  all this while my mind had been drifting
effortlessly down the great hallway of caer
llyr borne upon that tide that flows deepest

in the mind of ganelon the chosen of llyr-
ganelon who must one day return to him
who waits  as i was returning now

  a golden window glowed before me i
knew it for the window through which great
llyr looks out upon his world the window
through which he reaches for his sacrifices
and llyr was hungry i felt his hunger
llyr was roaming the thought-planes too
and in the moment that i realized again
where my mind was drifting i felt suddenly
the stir of a great reaching a tentacular
groping through the golden window

  llyr had sensed my presence in the planes
of his mind he knew his chosen he
stretched out his godlike grasp to fold me
into that embrace from which there is no
returning

  i heard the soundless cry of medea vanish-
ing like a puff of smoke out of the thought-
plane as she blanked her mind defensively
from the terror i heard matholchs voiceless
howl of pure fear as he closed his own mind
there was no sound from edeym but she
was gone as utterly as if she had never
thought a thought i knew the three of them
sat somewhere in their castle eyes and minds
closed tightly willing themselves to blank-
ness as llyr roamed the though t-lanes seek-
ing the food he had been denied so long

  a part of me shared the terror of the
coven but a part of me remembered llyr
for an instant almost i recaptured the dark
ecstasy of that moment when llyr and i were
one and the memory of horror and of dread-
ful joy came back the memory of a power
transcending all earthly things

  this was mine for the taking if i opened
my mind to llyr only one man in a genera-
tion is sealed to llyr sharing in his godhead
exulting with him in the ecstasy of human
sacrifice-and i was that one man if i chose
to complete the ceremony that would make
me llyrs if i chose if i dared-ah

  the memory of anger came back i must
not release myself into that promised joy
i had sworn to put an end to llyr i had
sworn by the sign to finish the coven and
llyr slowly reluctantly my mind pulled
itself back from the fringing contact of those
tentacles

the moment that tentative contact was
broken a full tide of horror washed over
me almost i had touched-him almost
i had let myself be defiled beyond all human
understanding by the terrible touch of-of-
	startling stories

there is no word in any language for the truth as i just learned it witch do you

thing that was llyr but i understood what
had been in my mind as edward bond when
i realized that to dwell on the same soil as
llyr share the same life was a defilement
that made earth and life too terrible to en-
dure-if one knew llyr

  i must put an end to him in that moment
i knew i must stand up and face the being
we knew as llyr and fight him to his end
no human creature had ever fully faced him
-not even his sacrifices not even his chosen
but his slayer would have to face him and
i had sworn to be his slayer

  shuddering i drew back from the black
depths of caer llyr struggled to the surface
of that still blue pool of thought which had
been freydis eyes the darkness ebbed
around me and by degrees the walls of the
cave came back the fuelless flame the great
smooth-limbed sorceress who held my mind
in the motionless deeps of her spell

  as i returned to awarenes slowly slowly
knowledge darted through my mind in light-
ning-flashes too swiftly to shape into words

  i knew i remembered

  ganelons life came back in pictures that
went vividly by and were printed forever on
my brain i knew his powers i knew his
secret strengths his hidden weaknesses i
knew his sins i exulted in his power and
pride i returned to my own identity and
was fully ganelon again or almost fully

  but there were still hidden things too
much had been erased from my memory to
come back in one full tide there were gaps
and important gaps in what i could recall

  the blue darkness cleared i looked into
freydis clear gaze across the fire i smiled
feeling a cold and arrogant confidence well-
ing up in me

 you have done well witch-woman i
told her

 you remember

  enough yes enough i laughed there
are two trials before me and the first is the
easier of the two and it is impossible but
i shall accomplish it

  ghast rhymi she asked in a quiet voice

 how do you know that

  i know the coven and i think but i am
not sure that in ghast rhymis hands he
the secrets of the coven and of llyr but
no man can force ghast rhymi to do his-
bidding

  ill find the way yes i will even tell you
what my next task is you shall have the

know of the mask and the wand

  her eyes on mine she shook her head tell
me perhaps i can help

  i laughed again it was so fantastically
implausible that she and i should stand here
sworn enemies of enemy clans planning a
single purpose together yet there was only
a little i hid from her that day and i think
not very much that freydis hid from me

  in the palace of medea is a crystal mask
and the silver wand of power i told her
what that wand is i do not quite remember
-yet but when i find it my hands will
know and with it i can overcome medea and
matholch and all their powers as for edeyrn
-well this much i know the mask will save
me from her

  i hesitated

 medea i knew now i knew the strange
hungers and the stranger thirsts that drove
the beautiful red and white witch to her
trystings i knew now and shuddered a little
to think of it why she took her captives with
those arrows of fire that did not kill at all
but only stunned them

 in the dark world my world mutation
has played strange changes upon flesh that
began as human medea was one of the
strangest of all there is no word in earth-
tongues for it because no creature such as
medea ever walked earth but there is an
approximation in reality perhaps and cer-
tainly in legend beings a little like her have
been known on earth the name they give
them is vampire

  but edeym no i could not remember it
may be that not even ganelon had ever
known i only knew that in time of need
edeyrn would uncover her face

  freydis i said and hesitated again
what is edeym

 she shook her massive head the white
braids stirring on her shoulders

  i have never known i have only probed
at her mind now and then when we met as
you met her today on the thought-lanes i
have much power ganelon but i have al-
ways drawn back from the chill i sensed
beneath edeyms hood no i cannot tell you
what she is

 i laughed again recklesness was upon
me now

 forget edeyrn i said when i have
forced ghast rhymi to my bidding and faced
llyr with the weapon that will end him what
shall i fear of edeym the crystal mask is
the dark world	

a talisman against her that much i know
let her be whatever monstrous thing she
wills-ganelon has no fear of her

  there is a weapon then against llyr
too

  there is a sword i said a sword that
is-is not quite a sword as we think of
weapons my mind is cloudy there still but
i know that ghast rhymi can tell me where
it is a weapon yet not a weapon the
sword called llyr

for an instant as i spoke that name it
seemed to me that the fire between us
flickered as if a shadow had passed across
its brightness i should not have called the
name aloud an echo of it had gone ringing
across the realms of thought and in caer
llyr perhaps llyr himself had stirred be-
hind the golden window-stirred and looked
out

  even here i felt a faint flicker of hunger
from that far-away domed place and sud-
denly i knew what i had done llyr was
awake

  i stared at freydis with widened eyes
meeting her blue gaze that was widening
too she must have felt the stir as it ran
formlessly all through the dark world in
the castle of the coven i knew they had
felt it too perhaps that they looked at one
another with the same instant dread which
flashed between freydis and me here

  llyr was awake

  and i had wakened him i had gone drift-
ing in thought down that shining corridor
and stood in thought before the very window
itself llyrs chosen facing llyrs living win-
dow no wonder he had stirred at last to full
awakening

 exultation buml up in my mind

  now they must move i told freydis joy-
fully you wrought better than you knew
when you set my mind free to rove its old
track llyr wakens and is hungrier than the
coven ever dared let him grow before for
overlong there has been no sabbat and llyr
ravens for his sacrifice have you spies
watching the castle now witch-woman

  she nodded

  good then we will know when the slaves
are gathered again for a sabbat meeting
it will be soon it must be soon and ed-
ward bond will lead an assault upon the
castle while the coven are at sabbat in caer
secaire there will be the mask and the
wand old woman my voice deepened to a

chant of triumph the mask and the wand
for ganelon and ghast rhymi alone in the
castle to answer me if he can the norns
fight on our side freydis

  she looked at me long and without speak-
ing

  then a grim smile broke across her face
and stooping she spread her bare hand palm
down upon the fuelless flame i saw the fire
lick up around her fingers deliberately she
crushed it out beneath her hand not flinching
at all

  the fire flared and died away the crystal
dish stood empty upon its pedestal and dim-
ness closed around us in that twilight the
woman was a great figure of marble tower-
ing beside me

  i heard her deep voice

  the norns are wtih us ganelon she
echoed see that you fight upon our side
too as far as your oath will take you or you
must answer to the gods and to me and by
the gods- she laughed harshly -by the
gods if you betray me i swear ill smash
you with no other power than this

  in the dimness i saw her lift her great
arms we looked one another in the eye
this mighty sorceress and i and i was not
sure but that she could overcome me in single
combat if the need arose by magic and by
sheer muscle i recognized an equal i bent
my head

  so be it sorceress i said and we clasped
hands there in the darkness and almost
i hoped i need not have to betray her

  side by side we went down the corridor
to the cave mouth

  the half-circle of foresters still awaited us
arles and the scarred lorryn stood a little
forward lifting their heads eagerly as we
emerged i paused catching the quiver ol
motion as calloused hands slipped stealthily
toward hilt and bowstring panic subdued
and breathless swept around the arc ol
woodsfolk

  i stood there savoring the moment of ter-
ror among them knowing myself ganelon
and the nemesis that would bring harsh jus-
tice upon them all in my own time in my
own good time

  but first i needed their help

  at my shoulder the deep voice of freydis
boomed through the glade

  i have looked upon this man she said
i name him-edward bond

  distrust of me fell away from them frey-
dis words reassured them

swords for the coven

now the sap that runs through ygdra-
sill-root stirred from its wintry slug-
gishness and the inhuman guardians of the
fate-tree roused to serve me the three noms
-the destiny-weavers-i prayed to them

  urdur who rules the past

 she whispered of the covenanters and
their powers and their weaknesses of mat-
holch the wolfling whose berserk rages were
his great flaw the gap in his armor through
which i could strike when fury had drowned
his wary cunning of the red witch and of
edeyrn-and of old ghast rhymi my en-
emies enemies whom i could destroy with
the aid of certain talismans that i had re-
membered now whom i would destroy

  verdandi who rules the present

 edward bond had done his best in the
caves the rebels had showed me were weap-
ons crude rifles and grenades gas-bombs and
even a few makeshift flame-throwers they
would be useful against the covens slaves
how useless they would be against the cove-
nanters i alone knew though freydis may
have known too

  yet arles and lorryn and their reckless
followers were ready to use those earth-
weapons very strange to them in a desperate
attack on the castle and i would give them
that chance as soon as our spies brought
word of sabbat-preparations it would be
soon it would have to be soon for llyr
was awake now-hungry thirsting-beyond
the golden window that is his door into the
worlds of mankind

  skuld who rules the future

  to skuld i prayed most of all i thought
that the coven would ride again to caer
secaire before another dawn came by then
i wanted the rebels ready

  edward bond had trained them well there
was military discipline after a fashion each
man knew his equipment thoroughly and all
were expert woodsmen we laid our plans
arles and lorryn and i-though i did not tell
them everything i intended-and group by
group the rebels slipped away into the forest
bound for the castle

 they would not attack they would not
reveal themselves until the signal was given
meantime they would wait concealed in the

gulleys and scrub-woods around the castle
but they would be ready when the time
came they would ride down to the great
gates their grenades would be helpful there

  nor did it seem fantastic that we should
battle magic with grenades and rifle for i
was beginning to realize more and more as
my lost memory slowly returned that the
dark world was not ruled by laws of pure
sorcery to an earth-mind such creatures
as matholch and medea would have seemed
supernatural but i had a double mind for
as ganelon i could use the memories of ed-
ward bond as a workman uses tools

  i had forgotten nothing i had ever known
about earth and by applying logic to the
dark world i understood things i had al-
ways before taken for granted

 the mutations gave the key there are
depths in the human mind forever un-
plumbed potentialities for power as there
are lost atrophied senses-the ancient third
eye that is the pineal gland and the human
organism is the most specialized thing of flesh
that exists

  any beast of prey is better armed with fang
and claw man has only his brain but as
carnivores grew longer more deadly talons
so mans mind developed correspondingly
even in earth-world there are mediums
mind-readers psychomantic experts esp
specialists in the dark world the mutations
had run wild producing cosmic abortions
for which there might be no real need for
another million years

  and such minds with their new powers
would develop tools for those powers the
wands though no technician i could under-
stand their principle science tends toward
simpler mechanisms the klystron and the
magnetron are little more than metal bars
yet under the right conditions given energy
and direction they are powerful machines

 well the wands tapped the tremendous
electromagnetic energy of the planet which
is after all simply a gargantuan magnet
as for the directive impulse trained minds
could easily supply that

  whether or not matholch actually changed
to wolf-form i did not know though i did
not think he did hypnosis was part of the
answer an angry cat will fluff out its fur
and seem double its size a cobra will in
effect hypnotize its prey why in order
to break down the enemys defences to dis-
arm him to weaken the single-purposiveness
that is so vital in combat no perhaps mat-
the dark world	

holch did not turn into a wolf but those
under the spell of his hypnosis thought he
did which came to the same thing in the end

 medea there was a parallel there are
diseases in which blood transfusions are peri-
odically necessary not that medea drank
blood she had other thirsts but vital ner-
vous energy is as real a thing as a leucocyte
and witch though she was she did not need
magic to serve her needs

of edeyrn i was not so sure some
stray remembrances hung like mists in
my mind once i had known what she was
what chilling power lay hidden in the dark-
ness of her cowl and that was not magic
either the crystal mask would protect me
against edeyrn but i knew no more than
that

 even llyr-even llyr he was no god
that i knew well yet what he might be
was something i could not even guess at as
yet eventually i meant to find out and the
sword called llyr which was not a true
sword would aid me then

 meanwhile i had my part to play even
with freydis as my sponsor i could not afford
to rouse suspicion among the rebels i had
explained that medeas drug had left me weak
and shaken that helped to explain any minor
lapses i might make curiously lorryn
seemed to have accepted me fully at freydis
word while in arles behavior i detected a
faint almost imperceptible reserve i do not
think that she suspected the truth or if
she did she was trying not to admit it even
in her own mind

  and i could not afford to let that suspicion
grow

  the valley was very active now

 much had happened since i came there in
the dawn i had been through enough exer-
tion both physical and emotional to last an
ordinary man for a week but ganelon had
only begun his battle it was thanks to ed-
ward bond that our plans for attack could
be formulated so readily and in a way i was
glad i had been too busy for anything but
the most impersonal planning with arles and
lorryn

 it helped to cover the great gaps of my
ignorance about things edward bond should
know many times i angled craftily for in-
formation many times i had to call upon the
excuse of the mythical drug and upon the
exhaustion of my ordeal at the castle but
by the time our plans were laid it seemed

to me that even arles suspicions were partly
lulled

  i knew i must lull them utterly

  we rose from the great map-table in the
council-cavern all of us were tired i met
lorryns scar-twisted grin warmth in it now
as he smiled at the man he thought his sworn
friend and i made edward bonds face smile
back at him

  well do it this time i told him con-
fidently this time well win

  his smile twisted suddenly into a grimace
and the light like embers glowed in his deep
eyes

  remember he growled matholch-for

me

  i looked down at the relief-map of the
table very skillfully made under edward
bonds directions

  the dark green hills rolling with their
strange forests of semi-animate trees every
brook traced in white plaster every roadway
marked i laid my hand on the little mound
of towers that was a miniature castle of the
coven from it stretched the highway i had
ridden last night beside medea in my blue
sacrificial robe there was the valley and the
windowless tower of caer secaire which had
been our destination

  for a moment i rode that highway again
in the darkness and the starshine seeing
medea beside me in her scarlet cloak her
face a pale oval in the dusk her mouth black-
red her eyes shining at me i remembered
the feel of that fiercely yielding body in my
arms as i had held her last night as i had
held her so many times before in my mind
whirled a question

  medea medea red witch of colchis why
did you betray me

  i ground my palm down on the tiny plaster
towers of the castle feeling them powder
away beneath my hand i grinned fiercely
at the ruin i had made of edward bonds
model

  well have no need for this again i said
through my teeth

  lorryn laughed

  no need to repair it tomorrow the coven
castle will be wreckage too

  i dusted the powdered plaster from my
hand and looked across the table at the
silent arles she looked at me gravely wait-
ing i smiled

  we havent had a moment alone together

i said making my voice tender ill need
sleep before i leave tonight but theres time
startling stories



for a walk if youll come with me

  the grave green gaze dwelt upon mine
then she nodded without smiling and came
around the table stretching out her hand to
me i took it and we went down the steps
to the cave-mouth and out into the glen
neither of us speaking i let her lead the way
and we walked in silence toward the upper
end of the valley the little stream tinkling
away beside us

  arles walked very lightly her gossamer
hair floating behind her in a pale misty veil
i wondered if it was by intent that she kept
her free hand resting upon the holstered
weapon at her side

it was hard for me to keep my mind
upon her or to care whether or not she
knew me for myself medeas face in all its
beauty and its evil floated before me up the
glen a face no man who looked upon it could
ever forget for a moment i was angry at
the recollection that edward bond in my
flesh had taken last night the kisses she
meant for ganelon

  well i would see her again tonight before
she died by my hand

  in my mind i saw the tiny roadway of the
map-table winding down from coven castle
to the sacrificial temple along the real road
sometime in the night to come i knew the
cavalcade would ride again as it had ridden
with me last night and again there would
be forest men hiding along the road and
again i would lead them against the coven
but this time the outcome would be very dif-
ferent from anything either the rebels or the
coven could expect

  what a strange web the norns had woven
last night as edward bond tonight as gane-
lon i would lead the same men in the same
combat against the same foe but with a pur-
pose as different as night from day

  the two of us deadly enemies though we
shared the same body in a strange inverted
way-enemies though we had never met and
never could meet for all our common flesh
it was an enigma too curious to unravel

  edward a voice said at my shoulder i
looked down arles was facing me with the
same enigmatic gaze i had met so often to-
day edward is she very beautiful

  i stared at her

 who

  the witch the coven witch medea

  i almost laughed aloud was this the an-
swer to all her aloofness of the day did

she think my own withdrawal all the changes
she sensed in me were due to the charms of
a rival beauty well i must set her mind
at rest about that at any rate i called upon
llyr to forgive me the lie and i took her
shoulders in my hands and said

  there is no woman on this world or on
earth half so beautiful as you my darling

  still she looked up at me gravely

  when you mean that edward ill be
glad she said you dont mean it now i
can tell no she put her fingers across my
mouth as i began to protest lets not talk
about her now shes a sorceress she has
powers neither of us can fight it isnt your
fault or mine that shes too beautiful to for-
get all in a moment never mind now look
do you remember this place

  she twisted deftly from my grasp and
swept out a hand toward the panorama spread
below us we stood in a grove of tall quiver-
ing trees high on the crest of the low moun-
tain the leaves and branches made a bower
around us with their showers of shaking ten-
drils but through an opening here and there
we could see the rolling country far below
us glowing in the light of the red westering
sun

  this will be ours some day said arles
softly after the coven is gone after llyr
has vanished well be free to live above
ground clear the forests build our cities-
live like men again think of it edward a
whole world freed from savagery and all
because there were a few of us at the start
who did not fear the coven and who found
you if we win the fight edward it will be
because of you and freydis we would all
have been lost without you

  she turned suddenly her pale gold hair
flying out around her face like a halo of float-
ing gauze and she smiled at me with a sud-
den bewitching charm i had never seen upon
her face before

  until now she had always turned a grave
reserve to my advances now suddenly i
saw her as edward bond had and it came
to me in a flash of surprise that bond was
a very fortunate man after all medeas
sultry scarlet beauty would never wholly
vanish from my mind i knew but this arles
had her own delicate and delightful charm

  she was very near me her lips parted as
she smiled up into my face for an instant
i envied edward bond then i remembered
i was edward bond but it was ganelon
who stooped suddenly and seized the forest
the dark world	

girl in a fiercely ardent embrace that amazed
her for i felt her gasp of surprise against
my breast and her stir of protest in the mo-
ment before my lips touched hers

  then she protested no longer

  she was a strange wild shy little creature
very pleasant in my arms very sweet to kiss
i knew by the way she responded to me that
edward bond had never held her like this
but then edward bond was a weakling and
a fool and before the kiss had ended i knew
where i would turn first for solace when
medea had paid for her treachery with her
life i would not forget medea but i would
not soon forget this kiss of arles either

  she clung to me in silence for a moment
her gossamer hair floating like thistledown
about us both and above her head i looked
out over the valley which she had seen in
her minds eyes peopled with free forest folk
dotted with their cities i knew that dream
would never come true

  but i had a dream of my own

	saw the forest people toiling to raise
my mighty castle here perhaps on this
very mountaintop a castle to dominate the
whole countryside and the lands beyond it
i saw them laboring under my overseers to
conquer still further lands i saw my armies
marching my slaves in my fields and mines
my navies on the dark oceans of a world that
might well be mine

  arles should share it with me-for awhile
for a little while

  i will always love you i said at her ear
in the voice of edward bond but it was
ganelons lips that found her lips in the one
last ardent kiss i had time for then

  curiously it seemed to me that it took
ganelons kisses at last to convince her i was

edward bond

  after that for a few hours i slept snug in
edward bonds cavern rooms in his comfort-
able bed his guards watching beside the
door i slept with the memory of his sweet
forest girl in my arms and the prospect of
his kingdom and his bride before me when
i woke i think in the earth-world edward
bond must have dreamed jealous dreams

  but my own dreams were bad llyr in his
castle was awake and hungry and the great
cold writhing tendrils of his hunger coiled
lazily through my mind as i slept i knew
they stirred through every mind in the dark
world that had senses to perceive them i
knew i must wake soon or never but first
i must sleep and grow strong for the nights
ordeal resolutely i shut llyr from my
thoughts resolutely i shut away arles

  it was medeas red smile and sidelong
sultry glance that went down with me into
the caverns of slumber

nuletly lorryn and i crouched among
the trees and looked out at the castle
of the coven aglitter with lights against the
starry sky this was the night we both
knew it and we were both tense and sweat-
ing with a nervous exultation that made this
waiting hard indeed

  all around us in the woods unseen we
heard the tiny sounds that meant an army of
forest people waited our signal and this time
they were here in force i caught a glint of

starlight now and then on rifle-barrels and
i knew that the rebels were armed to put
up a good fight against the soldiers of the
coven

  not perhaps too good a fight

  i did not care they thought they were
going to storm the castle and the coven
by sheer force of arms i knew their only
purpose was to divert attention while i made
my way into the castle and found the secret
weapons that would give me power over the
covenanters while they were striking i
would make my way to ghast rhymi and
learn what was essential for me to learn

  afte that i did not care many foresters
would die let them there would still be
slaves aplenty for me when my hour came
and nothing could stop me now the norns
fought with me i could not fail   

  there was much activity within the castle
voices floated out to us in the still night air
figures moved to and fro against the lights
then great gates were flung open upon a
burst of golden radiance and the outlines of
many riders crowded against it a procession
was coming out

  i heard chains clash musically and i un-
derstood this time the sacrifices rode chained
to their mounts so that no siren voices from
the wood could lure them away i shrugged
let them go to their death then llyr must
be fed while he lasted better these than
ganelon offered at the golden window we
saw them go off down the dark road their
chains ringing

  that was matholch-there on the tall horse
i knew his vulpine outlines the lift of the
cloak upon his shoulders and i would have
known him too because of the great start
quickly checked that lorryn made beside
me i heard the breath whistle through his
nostrils and his voice grated in my ear

 remember that is mine

  edeyrn went by tiny on her small mount
and a breath of chill seemed to me to sweep
the darkness as she passed

 medea came

  when i could no longer make out her out-
lines in the distance when her white robe
was no more than a shimmer and her scarlet
cloak had melted into the dark i turned to
lorryn my mind spinning my plans already
chaotic with change for a new compulsion
had come upon me and i was not even try-
ing to resist it

  i had not seen a sacrifice in caer secaire
this was one of the blank places in my mem-

ory and a dangerous blank until ganelon
remembered the sabbat until he watched
llyr accept the offerings through the golden
window he could not wholly trust himself
to fight the coven and llyr this was a gap
that must be filled and curiosity was sud-
denly very strong upon me curiosity-and
could it be-the pull of llyr

  lorryn wait for me here i whispered in
the darkness weve got to make sure they
enter caer secaire start the sabbat i dont
want to attack until im sure wait for me

  he stirred protestingly but i was away be-
fore he could speak i was out upon the road
and running softly and silently after that pro-
cessional winding toward the valley and the
mass of st secaire which is the black mass
it seemed to me as i ran that the fragrance
of medeas perfume hung upon the air i
breathed and my throat choked with the
passion of my hatred for her and of my love

  she shall be the first to die i promised
myself in the dark   

  i watched the great iron doors of caer
secaire swing shut upon the last of the pro-
cession the caer was dark inside they
went quietly in one by one and vanished
into the deeper night within the doors
clanged resonantly after them

  some memory of ganelons buried beneath
the surface of conscious thought urged me
to the left around the curve of the great
wall i followed the impulse obediently
moving almost like a sleep-walker toward
a goal i did not know memory took me close
under the looming rampart made me lay my
hands on its surface there were heavy
scrollings of pattern there writhing like ten-
drils over the dark walls my remembering
fingers traced the curves though my mind
still wondered

then the wall moved beneath my hands
the scroll-work had been a key of sorts
and a door sank open in the blackness before
me i went confidently forward out of black
night through a black door into deeper
blackness within but my feet knew the way

  a stairway rose beneath me in the dark
my feet had expected it and i did not stum-
ble it was very curious to move so blindly
through this strange and dangerous place
not knowing where or why i moved yet
trusting my body to find the way the stairs
wound up and up

  llyr was here i could feel his hungry
presence like a pressure on the mind but
the dark world	

many times intensified because of the narrow
spaces within these walls as if he were a
sound of thunder reverberating again and
again from the enclosed spaces of the caer
something within me reverberated sound-
lessly in answer a roar of exultation that i
suppressed in quick revolt

  llyr and i were no longer linked by that
ceremony of long ago i repudiated it i was
not llyrs chosen now but within me a
sense i could not control quivered with ec-
stasy at the thought of those sacrifices who
had filed blindly through the great doors of
caer secaire and i wondered if the coven
-if medea-thought of me now who had so
nearly stood with the sacrifices last night

  my feet paused upon the stairs i could see
nothing but i knew that before me was a
wall carved with scroll-patterns my hands
found it traced the raised designs a sec-
tion of darkness slid sidewise and i was lean-
ing upon a wide ledge looking down very
far down

  caer secaire was like a mighty grove of
columns whose capitals soared up and up
into infinite darkness somewhere above
too high for me to see its source a light was
beginning to glow my heart paused when
i saw it for i knew that light-that golden
radiance from a golden window

 memory came fitfully back to me the
window of llyr the window of the sacri-
fice i could not see it but my minds eye
remembered its glow in caer llyr that win-
dows substance shone eternally and llyr
himself lolled behind it-far behind it-for-
ever but in caer secaire and in the other
temples of sacrifice that had once dotted the
dark world there were replicas of the win-
dow which glowed only when llyr came
bodilessly through the dark to take his due

  above us hovering and hungry llyr was
dawning now in that golden radiance like a
sun in the night time of the temple where
the window of secaire was located how it
was shaped i still could not remember but
something in me knew that golden light and
shivered in response as i watched its bril-
liance strengthen through the columns of the
temple

  far below me i saw the coven standing
tiny figures foreshortened to wedges of col-
ored cloak-green-robed matholch yellow-
robed edeyrn red medea behind them stood
a circle of guardsmen before them as i
watched the last of the chosen slaves moved
blindly away among the columns i could

not see where they were going but in essence
i knew the window was yawning for its
sacrifices and somehow they must make their
way to it

  as the light broadened i saw that before
the coven stood a great cup-shaped altar
black on a black dais above it a lipped spout
hung my eyes traced the course of the
trough which ended in the spout and i saw
now that there was a winding descending
curve dark against that growing light which
came down in a great sweep from the mys-
terious heights overhead stretching from-
the window-to the cupped altar a stir
deep within me told me what that trough
was for i leaned upon the sill shaking with
an anticipation that was half for myself and
half for him who hovered above us in the
sun-like dawning of golden light

  thinly from below me rose a chant i knew
medeas voice clear and silver a thread of
sound in the dimness and the silence it rose
like incense quivering among the mighty
topless columns of secaire

  a tenseness of waiting grew and grew in
the dim air of the temple the figures below
me stood motionless heads lifted watching
the dawning light medeas voice chanted on
and on

  time paused there in the columned grove
of secaire while llyr hovered above us wait-
ing for his prey

  then a thin and terrible cry rang out from
the heights overhead one scream the light
shot out blindingly in a great burst of exulta-
tion like a voiceless answering cry from llyr
himself medeas chant rose to a piercing
climax and paused

  there was a stir among the columns some-
thing moved along that curve of trough my
eyes sought the altar and the lipped spout
above it

  the coven was rigid a cluster of frozen
figures waiting

  blood began to drip from the spout

  i do not know how long i hung there on
the ledge my eyes riveted to the altar i do
not know how many times i heard a cry ring
out from above how many times medeas
chant rose to a hungry climax as the light
burst forth in a glory overhead and blood
gushed into the great cup of the altar i was
deaf and blind to everything but this i was
half with llyr at his golden window shaken
with ecstasy as he took his sacrifices and
half with the coven below glorying in their
share of the ceremony of the sabbat
	startling stories

ut i know i waited too long

  what saved me i do not know now
some voice of the ego crying unheard in my
mind that this was time dangerously spent
that i must be elsewhere before the sabbat
ended that lorryn and his men waited end-
lessly while i hung here battening like a glut-
ton upon llyrs feast

  reluctantly awareness returned to my
mind with an infinite effort i pulled myself
back from the brink of that golden window
and stood reeling in the darkness but in my
own body again not hovering mindlessly
with llyr in the heights above the coven
was still tense below me gripped in the
ecstasy of the sacrifice but for how long i
could not be sure perhaps for the rest of the
night perhaps for only an hour i must
hurry if hurrying were not already futile
there was no way to know

  so i went back in the darkness down the
unseen stairs and out of the dark unseen
door and back along the road to coven
castle my mind still reeling with remem-
bered ecstasy the glow of the window still
before my dazzled eyes and the scarlet run-
nel above the altar and the thin sweet
chanting of medea louder in my ears than
the sound of my own feet upon the road   

  the red moon was far down the sky when
i came back to lorryn still crouching beside
the castle wall and half mad with impatience
there was an eager stir among the unseen
soldiers as i came running down the road a
forward surge as if they had waited to the
very limit of endurance and would attack
now whether i gave the word or no

  i waved to lorryn while i was still twenty
feet away i was careless now of the castle
guardsmen let them see me let them hear

  give the signal i shouted to lorryn
attack

  i saw him start up beside the road and
the moonlight glinted upon the silver horn
he lifted to his lips its blare of signal notes
ripped the night to tatters it ripped away
the last of my lethargy too

  i heard the long yell that swept the forest
as the woodsmen surged forward to the at-
tack and my own voice roared unbidden in
reply an ecstasy of battle-hunger that
matched the ecstasy i had just shared with
llyr

  the rattle of rifle-fire drowned out our
voices the first explosions of grenades shook
the castle outlining the outer walls in livid
detail there were shouts from within wild

trumpetings of signal horns the cries of con-
fused guardsmen leaderless and afraid but
i knew they would rally they had been
trained well enough by matholch and by
myself and they had weapons that could
give the woodsmen a stiff fight

  when they recovered from this panic there
would be much blood spilled around the
outer walls

  i did not wait to see it the first explosions
had breached the barriers close beside me
and i scrambled recklessly through the gap
careless of the rifle fire that spattered against
the stones the noms were with me tonight
i bore a charmed life and i knew i could not
fail

  somewhere above me in the besieged tow-
ers ghast rhymi sat wrapped in his chill
indifference aloof as a god above the strug-
gle around coven castle i had a rendezvous
with ghast rhymi though he did not know
it yet

  i plunged into the gateway of the castle
heedless of the milling guards they did not
know me in the darkness and the confusion
but they knew by my tunic i was not a
forester and they let me shoulder them aside

  three steps at a time i ran up the great
stairway

           chapter xii
           harp of satan

castle of the coven how strange it
looked to me as i went striding through
its halls familiar yet curiously unknown
as though i saw it through the veil of ed-
ward bonds transplanted memories

  so long as i went rapidly i seemed to know
the way but if i hesitated my conscious
mind took over control and that mind was
still clouded with artificial memories so that
i became confused in the halls and corridors
which were familiar to me when i did not
think directly of them

  it was as if whatever i focused on sharply
receded into unfamiliarity while everything
else remained clear until i thought of it

  i strode down hallways arched overhead
and paved underfoot in bright intricate
mosaics that told legendary tales half-
familiar to me i walked upon centaurs and
satyrs whose very faces were well known to
the ganelon half of my mind while the ed-
the dark world	

ward bond half wondered in vain whether
such people had really lived in this distorted
world of mutations

  this double mind at times was a source of
strength to me and at others a source of de-
vouring weakness just now i hoped fervent-
ly that i might meet no delays for once i
lost this rushing thread of memory which
was leading me toward ghast rhymi i might
never find it again any interruption might
be fatal to my plans

 ghast rhymi my memories told me would
be somewhere in the highest tower of ihe
castle there too would be the treasure-room
where the mask and the wand lay hidden
and hidden deeper in the serene untouch-
able thoughts of ghast rhymi lay the secret
of llyrs vulnerabiuty

 these three things i must have and the
getting would not be easy for i knew-with-
out clearly remembering how or by what-
that the treasure-room was guarded by
ghast rhymi the coven would not have
left open to all comers that secret place
where the things that could end them lay
hidden

 even i even ganelon had a secret thing
locked in that treasury for no covenanter
no warlock no sorceress can deal in the dark
powers without creating himself the one in-
strument that can destroy him that is the
law

 there are secrets behind it which i may
not speak of but the common one is clear
all earths folklore is rife with the same
legend powerful men and women must focus
their power in an object detached from
themselves

 the myth of the external soul is common
to all earth races but the reason for it lies
deep in the lore of the dark world this
much i can say-that there must be a bal-
ance in all things for every negative a
positive we of the coven could not build
up our power without creating a correspond-
ing weakness somewhere somehow and we
must hide that weakness so cunningly that
no enemy could find it

 not even the coven knew wherein my own
secret lay i knew medeas and i knew
edeyms only partially and as for matholch
-well against him i needed only my own
covenanter strength ghast rhymi did not
matter he would not bother to fight

 but llyr ah

 somewhere the sword lay hidden and he
who could find it and use it in that unknown

way for which it was fashioned he held the
existence of llyr in his own hand but there
was danger for as llyrs power in the dark
world was beyond imagination so too must
be that balancing power hidden in the sword
even to go near it might be fatally danger-
ous to hold it in the hand-well hold it i
must and there was no profit in thinking
about danger

  i went up and up on and on

  i could not hear the sounds of battle but
i knew that at the gate the coven guards
and slaves were fighting and falling as
lorryns men too were falling i had warned
lorryn that none must break through his
lines to warn those at caer secaire i knew
that he would follow that order despite his
anxiety to come to grips with matholch for
the rest there was one in the castle who
could without stirring send a message to
medea one person

  he had not sent that message i knew that
as i thrust through the white curtain and
came out into the tower room the little
chamber was semicircular walls floor and
ceiling were ivory pale the casement win-
dows were shut but ghast rhymi had never
needed sight to send out his vision

  he sal there an old old man relaxed amid
the cushions of his seat snowy hair and
beard falling in curled ringlets that blended
with his white plain robe his hands lay up-
on the chair-arms pale as wax so trans-
parent that i could almost trace the course
of the thinned blood that stirred so feebly in
those old veins

  wick and wax had burned down the flame
of life flickered softly and a wind might send
that flame into eternal darkness so sat the
ancient of days his blind blue gaze not
seeing me but turned upon inward things

lanelons memories flooded back
wjp ganelon had learned much from ghast
rhymi even then the covenanter had
been old now the tides of time had
worn him as the tides of the sea wear a stone
till nothing is left but a thin shell translucent
as clouded glass

  within ghast rhymi i could see the life-
fires dwindling sunk to embers almost ash

  he did not see me not easily can ghast
rhymi be drawn back from the deeps where
his thoughts move

  i spoke to him but he did not answer

  i went past him then warily toward the
wall that divided the tower-top into two
	startling stories

halves there was no sign of a door but i
knew the combination i moved my palms in
an intricate pattern on the cool surface and
a gap widened before me

  i crossed the threshold

  here were kept the holy things of the
coven

  i looked upon that treasure-vault with new
eyes clearer because of edward bonds
memories that lens burning with dull amber
lights there in its hollowed place in the wall
-i had never wondered much about it be-
fore it killed but memories of earth-science
told me why it was not magic but an in-
stantaneous drainage of the electrical energy
of the brain and that conical black device
-that killed too it could shake a man to
pieces by shuttling his life-force back and
forth so rapidly between artificial cathode
and anode that living flesh could not stand
the strain alternating current with varia-
tions

  but these weapons did not interest me
now i sought other loot there was no death-
traps to beware of for none but the coven
knew the way to enter this treasure-room or
its location or even that it existed save in
legends and no slave or guard would have
dared to enter ghast rhymis tower

  my gaze passed over a sword but not the
one i needed a burnished shield a harp set
with an intricate array of manual controls
i knew that harp earth has legends of it-
the harp of orpheus that could bring back
the dead from hades human hands could not
play it but i was not quite ready for the
harp yet

  what i wanted lay on a shelf sealed in its
cylindrical case i broke open the seals and
took out the thin black rod with its hand-
grip

  the wand of power the wand that could
tap the electro-magnetic force of a planet
so could other wands of this type-but this
was the only one without the safety-device
that limited its power it was dangerous to
use

  in another case i found the crystal mask
-a curved transparent plate that shielded
my eyes like a domino mask of glass this
mask would shield one from edeyrn

  i searched further but of the sword of
llyr i could find no trace

  time did not lag i heard nothing of the
noise of battle but i knew that the battle
went on and i knew too that sooner or
later the coven would return to the castle

well i could fight the coven now but i
could not fight llyr i dared not risk the is-
sue till i had made sure

  in the door of the vault i stood staring at
ghast rhymis silvery head whatever
guardian thought he kept here knew i had
a right to the treasure room he made no
motion his thoughts moved far out in un-
imaginable abysses nor could they be easily
drawn back and it was impossible to put
pressure on ghast rhymi he had the per-
fect answer he could die

  well i too had an answer

  i went back into the vault and lifted the
harp i carried it out and set it down before
the old man no life showed in his blue stare

  i went to the windows and flung them
open then i returned dropping to the cush-
ions beside the harp and lightly touched its
intricate controls

  that harp had been in the earth-world or
others like it legends know its singing
strings as legends tell of mystic swords
there was the lyre of orpheus strong with
power that jupiter placed amid the stars
there was the harp of gwydion of britain
that charmed the souls of men and the
harp of alfred that helped to crush dane-
land there was davids harp that he played
before saul

  power rests in music no man today can
say what sound broke the walls of jericho
but once men knew

  here in the dark world this harp had its
legends among the common folk men said
that a demon played it that the airy fingers
of elemental spirits plucked at its strings
well in a way they were right

for an incredible perfection of science
had created this harp it was a machine
sonic sub-sonic and pure vibration to
match the thought-waves emitted by the
brain blended into a whole that was part
hypnosis and part electric magnetism the
brain is a colloid a machine and any ma-
chine can be controlled

  and the harp of power could find the key
to a mind and lay bonds upon that mind

  through the open windows faintly from
below i heard the clash of swords and the
dim shouts of fighting men but these sounds
did not touch ghast rhymi he was lost on
the plane of pure abstraction thinking his
ancient deep thoughts

  my fingers touched the controls of the
harp awkwardly at first then with more
the dark world	

ease as manual dexterity came back with
memory

 the sigh of a plucked string whispered
through the white room the murmuring of
minor notes in a low dreamily distant key
and as the machine found the pattern of
ghast rhymis mind under my hands the
harp quickened into breathing life

 the soul of ghast rhymi-translated into
terms of pure music

 shrill and ear-piercing a single note sang
higher and higher it mounted fading into
inaudibility deep down a roaring windy
noise began rising and swelling into the
demon-haunted shout of a gale rivers of air
poured their music into the threnody

 high-high-cold and pure and white as
the snowy summit of a great mountain that
single thin note sang and sang again

 louder grew the great winds rippling
arpeggios raced through the rising torrent
of the sorcerous music

 thunder of riven rocks-shrill screaming
of earthquake-shaken lands-yelling of a
deluge that poured down upon tossing for-
ests

 a heavy humming note hollow and un-
earthly and i saw the gulfs between the
worlds where the empty night of space makes
a trackless desert

 and suddenly incongruously a gay lilt-
ing tune with an infectious rocking rhythm
that brought to my mind bright colors and
sunlit streams and fields

 ghast rhymi stirred

 for an instant awareness came back into
his blue eyes he saw me

 and i saw the life-fires sink within that
frail ancient body

 i knew that he was dying-that i had
troubled his long peace-that he had re-
linquished his casual hold upon life

 i drew the harp toward me i touched the
controls

 ghast rhymi sat before me dead the faint-
est possible spark fading within that old
brain

 i sent the sorcerous spell of the harp blow-
ing like a mighty wind upon the dying em-
bers of ghast rhymis life

 as orpheus drew back the dead eurydice
from plutos realm so i cast my net of music
snared the soul of ghast rhymi drew him
back from death

 he struggled at first i felt his mind turn
and writhe trying to escape but the harp
had already found the key to his mind and it

would not let him go inexorably it drew him

 the ember flickered-faded-brightened
again

  louder sang the strings deeper roared
the tumult of shaking waters

  higher the white shrill note pure as a
stars icy light leaped and ever rose

  roaring racing sweet with honey-musk
perfumed with flower-scent and ambergris
blazing with color opal and blood-ruby and
amethyst-blue that mighty tapestry of color
rippled and shook like a visible web of
magic through the room

  the web reached out

  swept around ghast rhymi like a fowlers
snare

  back in those faded blue eyes the light of
awareness grew he had stopped struggling
he had given up the fight it was easier to
come back to life-to let me question him-
than to battle the singing strings that could
cage a mans very soul

  under the white beard the old mans lips
moved

 ganelon he said i knew-when the
harp sang-who played it well ask your
questions and then let me die i would not
live in the days that are coming now but
you will live ganelon-and yet you will die
too that much i have read in the future

the hoary head bent slowly for an instant
ghast rhymi listened-and i listened too

  the last achingly sweet notes of the harp
died upon the trembling air

  through the open windows came the muted
clash of sword and the wordless shriek of a
dying man

chapter xiii
war-red war

pity flooded me the shadow of great-
ness that had cloaked ghast rhymi was
gone he sat there a shrunken fragile
old man and i felt a momentary unreason-
ing impulse to turn on my heel and leave
him to drift back into his-peaceful abyss of
thought once i remembered ghast rhymi
had seemed a tall huge figure-though he
had never been that in my lifetime but in my
childhood i had sat at the feet of this cov-
enanter and looked up with awe at that
majestic bearded face with reverence

perhaps there had been more life in that
	startling stories

face then more warmth and humanity it
was remote now it was like the face of a god
or of one who had looked upon too many
gods

  my tongue stumbled

  master i said i am sorry

  no light came into the distant blue gaze
yet i sensed a stirring

  you name me master he said you-
ganelon it has been a long time since you
humbled yourself to anyone

  the taste of my triumph was ashes i
bowed ray head yes i had conquered ghast
rhymi and i did not like the savor of that
conquest

  in the end the circle completes itself
the old man said quietly we are more kin
than the others both you and i are human
ganelon not mutants because i am leader
of the coven i let medea and the othei-s use
my wisdom but-but- he hesitated

  for two decades my mind has dwelt in
shadow he went on beyond good and
evil beyond life and the figures that move
like puppets on the stream of life when i
was wakened i would give the answers i
knew it did not matter i had thought that
i had lost all touch with reality and that
if death swept over every man and woman in
the dark world it would not matter

  i could not speak i knew that i had done
ghast rhymi a very great wrong in waken-
ing him from his deep peace

  the blue stare dwelt on me

  and i find that it does matter after all
no blood of mine runs in your veins gane-
lon yet we are kin i taught you as i would
have taught my own son i trained you for
your task-to rule the coven in my place
and now i think i regret many things
most of all the answer i gave the cove-
nanters after medea brought you back from
earth-world

  you told them to kill me i said

  he nodded

  matholch was afraid edeyrn sided with
him they made medea agree matholch said
ganelon is changed there is danger let the
old man read the future and see what it
holds so they came to me and i let my
mind ride the winds of time and see what lay
ahead

  and that was-

  the end of the coven ghast rhymi said
if you lived i foresaw the arms of llyr
reaching into the dark world and matholch
lying dead in a shadowed place and doom

upon edeyrn and medea for time is fluid
ganelon it changes as men change the
probabilities alter when you went into
earth-world you were ganelon but you
came back with a double mind you have the
memories of edward bond which you can
use as tools medea should have left you in
earth-world but she loved you

  yet she agreed to let them kill me i
said

  do you know what was in her thoughts
ghast rhymi asked in caer secaire at the
time of sacrifice llyr would come and you
have been sealed to llyr did medea think
you could be killed then

  a doubt grew within me but medea had
led me like a sheep to slaughter in the
procession to the caer if she could justify
herself let her i knew that edeyrn and
matholch could not

  i may let medea five then i said but
not the wolfling i have already promised his
life and as for edeyrn she must perish

  i showed ghast rhymi the crystal mask
he nodded

  but llyr

  i was sealed to him as ganelon i said
now you say i have two minds or at least
an extra set of memories even though they
are artificial i am not willing to be liege to
llyr i learned many things in the earth-
world llyr is no god

  the ancient head bent a transparent hand
rose and touched the ringlets of the beard
then ghast rhymi looked at me and he
smiled

  so you know that do you he asked
i will tell you something ganelon that no
one else has guessed you are not the first
to come from earth-world to the dark
world i was the first

stared at him with unconcealed
amazement

  and you were bom in the dark world

i was not he said my flesh sprang from
the dust of earth it has been very long
since i crossed and i can never retnrn now
for my span is long outlived only here can
i keep the life-spark burning within me
though i do not much care about that either
yet i am earth-born and i knew vortigem
and the kings of wales i had my own hold-
ings at caer-merdin and a different sun
from this red ember in the dark worlds sky
shone upon caer-merdin blue sky blue sea
of britain the gray stones of the druid altars
the dark world	

under the oak forests that is my home
ganelon was my home until my science
that men in those days called magic brought
me here with a womans aid a dark-world
woman named viviane

  you are earth-born i said

  once-yes as i grew older here very
very old i regretted my exile i had acquired
enough of wisdom i would have changed it
all for one breath of the cool sweet air that
blew in from the irish sea when i was a boy
but never could i return my body would
fall to dust in the earth-world so i lost my-
self in dreams-dreams of earth ganelon

  his blue eyes brightened with memories

  his voice deepened

  in my dreams i brought back the old days
i stood again on the crags of wales watch-
ing the salmon leaping in the waters of gray
usk i saw artorius again and his father
uther and i smelled the old smells of britain
in her youth but they were dreams

  and dreams are not enough for the sake
of the love i bore the dust from which i
sprang for the sake of a wind that blew
from ancient ireland i will help you now
ganelon i had never thought that life would
matter to me any more but that these abom-
inations should lead a man of earth to
slaughter-no and man of earth you are
now though born on this world of sorcery

  he leaned forward compelling me with his
gaze

  you are right llyr is no god he is-a
monster no more than that and he can be
slain

  with the sword called llyr

  listen put these legends out of your
mind that is llyrs power and the power of
the dark world all is veiled in mystic sym-
bols of terror but behind the veil lies simple
truth vampire werewolf upas-tree-they
all are biological freaks mutations run wild
and the first mutation was llyr his birth
split the one time-world into two each
spinning along its line of probability he was
a key factor in the temporal pattern of en-
tropy

  listen again at birth llyr was human
but his mind was not as the minds of others
he had certain natural powers latent powers
which ordinarily would not have developed
in the race for a million years because they
did develop in him too soon they were
warped and distorted and put to evil ends
in the future world of logic and science his
mental powers would have fitted in the dark

times of superstition they did not fit too well
so he developed with the science at his
command and the mental strength he had in-
to a monster

  human once less human as he grew
 older and wiser in his alien knowledge in
 caer llyr are machines which send out cer-
 tain radiations necessary to the existence of
 llyr those radiations permeate the dark
 world they have caused other mutations
 such as matholch and edeym and medea

   kill llyr and his machines will stop
 the curse of abnormal mutations will be
 lifted the shadow over this planet will be
 gone

   how may i kill him i asked

   with the sword called llyr his life is
 bound up with that sword as a machine is
 dependent on its parts i am not certain of
 the reason for this ganelon but llyr is not
 human-now he is part machine and part
 pure energy and part something unimagin-
 able but he was born of flesh and he must
 maintain his contact with the dark world
 or die the sword is his contact

  where is the sword

  at caer llyr ghast rhymi said go
 there by the altar there is a crystal pane
 dont you remember

   i remember

   break that pane then you will find the
 sword called llyr

   he sank back his eyes closed then opened
 again

i knelt before him and he made the
ancient sign above me

   strange he murmured half to himself
 strange that i should send a man to battle
 again as i sent so many long ago

  the white head bent forward snowy
 beard lay upon the snowy robe

  for the sake of a wind that blew from
 ireland the old man whispered

   through the open windows a breath of air
 drifted gently ruffling the white ringlets of
 hair and beard   

   the winds of the dark world stirred in the
 silent room paused-and were gone

   now indeed i stood alone   

 from ghast rhymis chamber i went down
 the tower steps and into the courtyard

 the battle was nearly over scarcely a
 score of the castles defenders were still on
 their feet around them lorryns pack rav-
 ened and yelled back to back grimly silent
 the dead-eyed guardsmen wove their blades
	startling stories

in a steel mesh that momentarily held at
bay their attackers

  there was no time to be wasted here i
caught sight of lorryns scarred face and
made for him he showed me his teeth in a
triumphant grin

 we have them bond

  it took you long enough i said these
dogs must be slain quickly i caught a sword
from a nearby woodsman

  power flowed up the blade and into the
hilt-into me

  i plunged into the thick of the battle the
foresters made way for me beside me lorryn
laughed quietly

  then i came face to face with a guardsman
his blade swung up in thrust and parry and
i twisted aside so that his steel sang harm-
lessly through the air my sword-point leaped
like a striking snake for his throat the shock
of metal grating on bone jarred my wrist

 i tore the weapon free and glimpsed
lorryn still grinning engaging another of
the guardsmen

  kill them i shouted kill them

  i did not wait for response i went forward
against the blind-eyed soldiers of medea
slashing striking thrusting as though these
men were the coven my enemies i hated
each blankly staring face red tides of rage
began to surge up narrowing my vision and
clouding my mind with hot mists

  for a few moments i was drunk with the
lust for killing

  lorryns hands gripped my shoulders his
voice came

  bond bond

  the fogs were swept away i stared around
not one of the guardsmen was left alive
bloody hacked corpses lay sprawled on the
gray flagstones of the courtyard the woods-
men panting hard were wiping their blades
clean

  did any escape to carry warning to caer
secaire i asked

  despite his perpetual scarred grin lorryn
looked troubled

  im not sure i dont think so but the
place is a rabbit-warren

  the harms done then i said we hadnt
enough men to throw a cordon around the
castle

  he grimaced warned or not whats the
odds we can slay the covenanters as we
killed their guards

  we ride to caer llyr i said watching
him

  i saw the shadow of fear in the cold gray
eyes lorryn rubbed his grizzled beard and
scowled

  i dont understand why

  to kill llyr

  amazement battled with ancient super-
stitious terror in his face his gaze searched
mine and apparently read the answer he
wanted

  to kill-that

  i nodded ive seen ghast rhymi he told
me the way

 the men around us were watching and
listening lorryn hesitated

  we didnt bargain for this he said yet
by the gods to kill llyr

  suddenly he sprang into action shouting
orders swords were sheathed men ran to
untether the mounts within minutes we
were in our saddles riding out from the
courtyard the shadow of the castle falling
heavily upon us till the moon lifted above the
tallest tower

  i rose in my stirrups and looked back up
there dead sat ghast rhymi first of the
coven to die by my hand i had killed him as
surely as if i had plunged steel into his heart

  i dropped back into the saddle pressing
heels into my horses flanks he bolted for-
ward lorryn urged his steed level with me
behind us the woodsmen strung out in a
long uneven line as we galloped across the
low hills toward the distant mountains it
would be dawn before we could reach caer
llyr and there was no time to waste

medea and edeyrn and matholch the
names of the three beat like muffled
drums in my brain traitors to me medea
no less than the others for had she not
bent before the wills of edeyrn and matholch
had she not been willing to sacrifice me
death i would give edeyrn and the wolfling
medea i might let live but only as my slave
nothing more

  with ghast rhymi dead i was leader of
the coven in the old mans tower senti-
mental weakness had nearly betrayed me
the weakness of edward bond i thought
his memories had watered my will and di-
luted my power

  now i no longer needed his memories at
my side swung the crystal mask and the
wand of power i knew how to get the sword
called llyr it was ganelon and not the
weakling edward bond who would make
himself master of the dark world
the dark world	

 briefly i wondered where bond was now
when medea had brought me through the
need-fire to the dark world edward bond
at that same moment must have returned
to earth i smiled ironically imagining the
surprise that must have been his perhaps
he had tried and was still trying to get back
to the dark world but without freydis to
aid him his attempts would be useless frey-
dis was helping me now not bond

 and bond would stay on earth the sub-
stitution would not occur again if i could
help it and i could help it strong freydis
might be but could she stand against the
man who had killed llyr i did not think
so

 i sent a sly sidewise glance at lorryn
fool arles too was another of the same
breed only freydis had sense enough not
to trust me

  the strongest of my enemies must die first
-llyr then the coven after that the
woodsmen would taste my power they
would learn that i was ganelon not the
earth weakling edward bond

 i thrust the memories of bond out of my
mind i drove them away i banished them
utterly

  as ganelon i would battle llyr

 and as ganelon i would rule the dark
world

  rule-with iron and fire

chapter xiv
fire  life

hours before we came to caer llyr we
saw it at first a blacker blackness
against the night sky and slowly gradually
deepening into an ebon mountain as the rose-
gray dawn spread behind us

  our cantering shadows feus before us to be
trodden under the horses hoofs cool fresh
winds whispered-whispered of the sacrifice
at caer secaire of the seeking minds of the
coven that spied across the land

  but caer llyr loomed on the edge of dark-
ness ahead-guarding the night

 huge the caer was and alien it seemed
shapeless a titan mound of jumbled black
rock thrown almost casually together yet i
knew that there was design in its strange
geometry

  two jet pillars each fifty feet tall stood
like the legs of a colossus and between them
was an unguarded portal only there was
there any touch of color about the caer

  a veil of flickering rainbows played am-
bently like a veil across that threshold
opalescent and faintly glowing the shadow-
cuitain swung and quivered as though gen-
tle winds drifted through gossamer folds of
silk

  fifty feet high was that curtain and twen-
ty feet broad straddling it the ebon pillars
rose and above and beyond towering
breathtakingly to the dawn-clouded sky
squatted the caer a mountain-like structure
that had never been built by man

  from caer llyr a breath of fear came cold-
ly scattering the woodsmen like leaves before
a gale they broke ranks deployed out and
drew together again as i raised my hand and
lorryn called a command

  i stared around at the low hills surround-
ing us

  never in my memory or my fathers
memory have men come this close to caer
llyr lorryn said except for covenanters
of course nor would the foresters follow me
now bond they follow you

  how far would they follow my wonder-
ing thought was cut off as a woodsman shout-
ed warning he rose in his stirrups and
pointed south

  over the hills riding like demons in a
dusty cloud came horsemen their armor
glittering in the red sunlight

  so someone did escape from the castle
i said between my teeth and the coven
have been warned after all

  lorryn grinned and shrugged not many
enough to delay us i frowned trying
to make the best plan lorryn stop them
if the coven ride with their guards kill them
too but hold them back from the caer un-
til-

  until

  i dont know ill need time how much
time i cant say battling and conquering
llyr wont be the work of a moment

  nor is it the work of one man lorryn
said doubtfully with us to aid you victory
will fly at your elbow

  i know the weapon against llyr i said
one man can wield it but keep the guards-
men back and the covenanters too give
me time

  there will be no difficulty about that
lorryn said a flash of excitement fighting
	startling stories

his eyes for look

  angling across the hills riding one by one
into view hotly pursuing the armored rout
came green-clad figures spurring their
horses forward

 those figures were woodsmens women
whom we had left behind in the valley they
were armed now for j saw the glitter of
swords nor were swords their only weapons
a spiteful crack echoed a puff of smoke
arose and one of the guardsmen flung up his
hands and toppled from his mount

 edward bond had known how to make
rifles and the woodsfolk had learned how
to use them

  at the head of the woodswomen i noted
two lithe forms one a slim supple girl whose
ashy-blond hair streamed behind her like
a banner arles

  and at her side on a great white steed
rode one whose giant form i could not mis-
take even from this distance freydis spurred
forward like a valkyrie galloping into battle

  freydis and arles and the women of the
forest

  lorryns laugh held exultation

  we have them bond he cried his fist
tightening on the rein our women at their
heels and we to strike from the flank-well
catch and crush them between hammer and
anvil gods grant the shape-changer rides
there

  then ride i snapped no more talk
ride and crush them hold them back from
the caer

  with that i raced my steed forward lying
low on the horses mane driving like a thun-
derbolt toward the black mountain ahead
did lorryn know how suicidal might be the
mission on which i had sent him matholch
he might slay and even medea but if edeyrn
rode with the coven guards if ever she
dropped the hood from her face neither
sword nor bullet could save the woodsmen

still they would give me time and if
the woodsmens ranks were thinned so
much the better for me later i would deal
with edeyrn in my own way when the time
came

  ahead the black columns stood behind
me a shouting rose and a crackle of rifle-fire
i looked back but a fold of the hills hid the
combat from my eyes

  i sprang from the horses back and stood
before the pillars-between them the corus-
cating veil sparkled and ran like milky water

before me above towering monstrously
stood the caer the focus of the evil that had
spread across the dark world

and in it reposed llyr my enemy

i still had the sword i had taken from
one of the woodsmen but i doubted if ordi-
nary steel would be much good within the
caer nevertheless i made sure the weapon
was at my side as i walked forward

 i stepped through the veil

 for twenty paces i moved forward in utter
 darkness then light came

 but it was the light that beats upon a snow
 plain so bright so glittering that it blinds
 i stood motionless waiting presently the
 dazzle resolved itself into flickering atoms
 of brightness weaving and darting in ara-
 besque patterns not cold no

tropical warmth beat upon me

the shining atoms drove at me they tin-
gled upon my face and hands they sank
like intangible things through my garments
and were absorbed by my skin they did not
lull me instead my body greedily drank
that weird snowstorm of-energy-and was
in turn energized by it

 tide of life sang ever stronger in my veins

 i saw three gray shadows against the white
 two tall and one slight and small as a childs
 shadow

i knew them i knew who cast them

 i heard matholchs voice

kill him kill him now

and medeas answer

no he need not die he must not

but he must matholch snarled and
edeyrns sexless thin voice echoed his

he is dangerous medea he must die
and only on llyrs altar can he be slain for
he is the sealed of llyr

 he need not die medea said stubbornly
 if he is made harmless-weaponless-he
 may live

how edeyrn asked and for answer the
red witch stepped forward out of the dazzling
white shimmer

no longer a shadow no longer a two-di-
mensional grayness she stood before me-
medea witch of colchis

 her dark hair fell to her knees her dark
 gaze slanted at me evil she was and al-
 luring as lilith

i dropped my hand to sword-hilt

 i did not i could not move faster swirled
 the darting bright atoms whirling about me
 sinking into my body to betray me

 i could not move
the dark world

 beyond medea the twin shadows bent for-
ward

 the power of llyr holds him edeyrn
whispered but ganelon is strong medea
if he breaks his fetters we are lost

 by then he will have no weapons medea
said and smiled at me

 now indeed i knew my danger very
easily my steel could have bitten through
medeas soft throat and heartily i wished
it had done so long ago for i remembered
medeas power the mutation that set her
apart from others that which had caused
her to be named-vampire



  i remembered victims of hers that i had
seen the dead-eyed guardsmen the castle
slaves hollow shells of men the walking
dead all soul drained from them and most
of their life-force as well

 her arms stole around my neck her
mouth lifted to mine

  in one hand she held her black wand it
touched my head and a gentle shock not
unpleasant crawled along my scalp the-
the conductor i knew and a gust of insane
laughter shook me at the incongruity of the
weapon

  but there was no magic here there was
science of a high order a science made pos-
sible only for those who were trained to it
or for those who were mutants medea drank
energy but not through sorcery i had seen
that wand used too often to believe that

  the wand opened the closed circuit of the
mind and its energies it tapped the brain
as a copper wire can tap a generated current

  diverting the life-force to medea

the shining misl-motes swirled faster
they closed in around us bathing us in
a swirling cloak the gray shadowiness fell
away from edeym and matholch dun-
cloaked cowled dwarf and lean grinning
wolfling stood there watching

  edeyrns face i could not see though the
deadly cold crept from beneath the cowl
like an icy wind matholchs tongue crept
out and circled his lips his eyes were bright
with triumph and excitement

  a numbing lethargic languor was stealing
over me against my mouth medeas lips
grew hotter more ardent as my own lips
chilled desperately i tried to move to grasp
my sword-hilt

  i could not

  now the bright veil thinned again be-
yond matholch and edeyrn i could see a vast
space so enormous that my gaze failed to
pierce its violet depths a stairway led up
to infinite heights

  a golden glow burned high above

  but behind matholch and edeym a little
to one side stood a curiously-carved pedestal
whose front was a single pane of transparent
glass it shone steadily with a cool blue light
what lay within i did not know but i recog-
nized that crystal pane

  ghast rhymi had spoken of it behind it
must lie the sword called llyr

  faintly now-faintly-i heard matholchs
satisfied chuckle

  ganelon my love do not struggle against
me medea whispered only i can save
you when your madness passes we will re-
turn to the castle

  yes for i would be no menace then ma-
tholch would not bother to harm me as a
mindless soulless thing i would return to
the castle of the coven as medeas slave

  i ganelon hereditary lord of the coven
and the sealed of llyr

  the golden glow high above brightened
crooked lightnings rushed out from it and
were lost in the violet dimness

  my eyes found that golden light that was
the window of llyr

  my mind reached out toward it

  my soul strained to it

  witch and vampire-mutation medea might
be-or sorceress-but she had never teen
sealed to llyr no dark power beat latently
in her blood as it beat in mine well i knew
now that no matter how i might renounce
my allegiance to llyr there yet had been a
bond llyr had power over me but i could
draw upon his power as well

  i drew on that power now

  the golden window brightened again
forked lightnings ran out from it and were
gone a muffled heavy drum-beat muttered
from somewhere like the pulse of llyr

  like the heart of llyr stirring from sleep
to waking

  through me power rushed quickening my
flesh from its lethargy i drew on llyrs
power without measuring the cost i saw fear
flash across matholchs face and edeyrn
made a quick gesture

  medea she said

  but medea had already sensed that quick-
ening i felt her body quiver convulsively
against mine avidly she pressed against
me faster and faster she drank the energy
that made me alive

  but the energy of llyr poured into me
hollow thunders roared in the vast spaces
above the golden window blazed with daz-
zling brightness and around us now the
sparkling motes of light paled shrank and
were gone

  kill him matholch howled he holds
llyr

  he sprang forward

  from somewhere a bloody figure in dented
armor stumbled i saw lorryns scarred face
twist in amazement as he blinked at the
tableau his sword red to the hilt was bare
in his hand

  he saw me with medeas arms about my
neck

  he saw edeyrn

  and he saw matholch

  a wordless inarticulate sound ripped from
lorryns throat he lifted high the sword

  as i tore myself free from medeas grip
as i sent her reeling away i saw matholchs
wand come up i reached for my own wand
but there was no need

  lorryns blade sang matholchs hand still
gripping the wand was severed at the wrist
blood spouted from cut arteries
the dark world	

  howling the shape-changer dropped for-
ward the lycanthropic change came upon
him hypnotism mutation dark sorcery-i
could not tell but the thing that sprang at
lorryns throat was not human

  lorryn laughed he sent his sword spin-
ning away

  he met the wolflings charge bracing him-
self strongly and caught the thing by throat
and leg fanged jaws snapped viciously at
him

  lorryn heaved the monster above his head
his joints cracked with the inhuman strain
one instant lorryn stood there holding his
enemy high while the wolf-jaws snarled and
strove to rend him

  he dashed the wolf down upon the stones

  i heard bones snap like rotten twigs i
heard a scream of dying terrible agony from
a gaping muzzle from which blood poured

  then matholch in his own shape broken
dying lay writhing at our feet

         chapter xv
         lair of power

miraculously the weakness that

had chained me was gone llyrs
strength poured through me i unsheathed
my sword and ran past matholchs body ig-
noring lorryn who stood motionless staring
down i ran to the pedestal with its blue-
litten pane

  i gripped the swords blade and sent the
heavy hilt crashing against the glass

  there was a tinkling of pizzicato notes a
singing of thin goblin laughter the shards
fell clashing at my feet

  at my feet also dropped a sword a sword
of crystal nearly five feet long-pommel and
guard and blade all of clearest glass

  it had been part of the window for within
the hollow pedestal was nothing at all the
sword had been part of the pane so that my
breaking the crystal had released the weapon
from its camouflaged hiding-place

  along the sleek blade blue light ran with-
in the crystal blue fires burned wanly i
bent and picked up the sword the hilt was
warm and alive

  the sword called llyr in my left hand
the sword with blade of steel in my right i
stood upright

  paralyzing cold breathed past me

  i knew that cold

  so i did not turn i swung the steel sword
 under my arm snatched the crystal mask
 from my belt and donned it i drew the
 wand of power

  only then did i turn

  through the mask queer glimmers and
shiftings ran distorting what i saw the
properties of light were oddly altered by the
mask but it had its purpose it was a filter

  matholch lay motionless now beyond his
body medea was rising to her feet her dark
hair disordered facing me stood lorryn
a stone man only his eyes alive in his set
white face

  he was staring at edeym whose sleek dark
 head i saw her back was toward me the
 cowl had been flung back upon her shoul-
 ders

  lorryn sagged down the life going out of
 him bonelessly as water he collapsed

  he lay dead

  then slowly slowly edeyrn turned

  she was tiny as a child and her face was
 like a childs too in its immature roundness
 but i did not see her face for even through
 the crystal mask burned the gorgons glare

  the blood stilled within me a slow tide
of ice crept with iron lethargy into my brain
and cold weariness engulfed me

  only in the eyes of the gorgon fire burned

  deadly radiations were there what earth-
 scientists call ectogenetic rays but limited till
 now to the plant-world only the mad muta-
 tion that had created edeyrn could have
 brought from hell such a nightmare trick of
 biology

  but i did not fall i did not die the radi-
 ations were filtered made harmless by the
 vibration-warping properties of the mask
 i wore

  i lifted the wand of power

  red fires blasted from it scarlet licking
 tongues seared out toward edeyrn

  lashes of flame tore at her like erimson
 whips that burned and left bloody weals on
 that calm child-face

  she drew back the lance of her stare driv-
 ing at me

  with her step by step retreated medea
toward the foot of the great stairway that
led to llyrs window

  the whips of fire seared across her eyes

  she turned and stumbling began to run
up the stairway medea paused her arms
lifted in an uncompleted gesture but in my
face she read no softening
	startling stories

  she too turned and followed edeyrn

  i dropped the useless sword of steel wand
in left hand the sword called llyr in my
right i followed them

  as my foot touched the first step a trem-
bling vibration shook the violet air about me
now almost i regretted having called upon
llyr to break medeas spell for llyr was
awake watching and warned

  the pulse of llyr muttered through the
huge caer the golden lightnings flamed
from the window high above

  briefly two black small silhouettes showed
against that amber glow they were edeyrn
and medea climbing

  after them i went and at each step the
way grew harder i seemed to walk through
a thickening invisible torrent that was like
a wind or a wave flowing down from that
shining window striving to tear me from my
foothold to rip the crystal sword from my
grip

rp and up i went now the window
was a glaring blaze of yellow fires
the lightnings crackled out incessantly while
rocking crashes of thunder reverberated
along the vaulted abysses of the caer i
leaned forward as though against a gale
doggedly i fought my way up the stair

  there was someone behind me

  i did not turn i dared not for fear the
torrent would sweep me from my place i
crawled up the last few steps and came out
on a level platform of stone a disc-shaped
dais on which stood a ten-foot cube three
of its sides were of black rock the side
that faced me was a glaring blaze of amber
brilliance

  far below dizzyingly far was the floor of
the caer behind me the stairway ran down
to those incredible depths and the tremen-
dous wind still blew upon me pouring out
from the window seeking to whirl me to
my death

  to the windows left stood edeyrn to its
right medea and in the window-

  the blazing golden clouds whirled thick-
ened tossed like storm-mists while still the
blinding flashes spurted from them the
thunder never ceased now but it pulsed it
rose and fell in steady cadence in unison
with the heart-beat of llyr

  monster or mutation-human once or half-
human-llyr had grown in power since then
ghast rhymi had warned me

  part machine and part pure energy and

        i

part something unthinkable the power of
llyr blasted through the golden clouds upon
me

 the wand of power dropped from my
hand i lifted the crystal sword and man-
aged one forward step then the hell-tide
caught me and i could advance no further
i could only fight with every bit of my
strength against the avalanche that strove
to thrust me toward the edge of the hanging
platform

  louder grew the thunders brighter the
lightnings flamed

  the cold stare of edeyrn chilled me
medeas face was inhuman now yellow
clouds boiled out from the window and
caught edeyrn and medea in their embrace

  then they rolled toward me and over-
whelmed me

  dimly i could see the brighter glow that
marked llyrs window and two vague
silhouettes edeyrn and medea

  i strove to step forward instead i was
borne back toward the edge-back and back

  great arms caught me about the waist a
braid of white hair tossed by my eyes the
giant strength of freydis stood like a wall
of iron between me and the abyss

  from the corner of my eye i saw that she
had wound a scrap torn from her white robe
about her head shielding her from the gor-
gons stare blindly guided by some strange
instinct the valkyrie thrust me forward

  against us the golden clouds rolled senti-
ent palpable veined with white lightnings
and shaking with deep thunders

  freydis strove silently i bent forward
like a bow battering against the torrent

  step by step i won forward freydis to
aid me ever she stood as a bulwark against
my back i could hear her panting breath
great gasps that ripped from her throat as
she linked her strength with mine

  my chest felt as though a white-hot core
of iron was driven through it yet i went
on nothing existed now but that golden
brightening amid the clouds clouds of cre-
ation sentient with the shaking tumult of
breaking universes worlds beyond worlds
crashing into ruin under the power of
llyr----

  i stood before the window

  without volition my arm swept up i
brought the sword called llyr smashing
down upon llyrs window

  in my hand the sword broke

  it fell to tinkling fragments at my feet
the dark world	

the veined blue glimmers writhed and coiled
about the broken blade

  were sucked into the window

  back rushed the cloud-masses a tremen-
dous nearly unbearable vibration ripped
through the caer shaking it like a sapling
the golden clouds were drawn through the
window

  with them went edeyrn and medea

  one glimpse i had of them the brand of
my fire like a red mask across edeyms eyes
medeas face despairing and filled with a hor-
ror beyond life her gaze fixed on me with
an imploring plea that was infinitely terrible
then they vanished

  for one instant i saw through the window
i saw something beyond space and time and
dimension a writhing ravening chaos that
bore down upon medea and edeym and a
golden core of light that i knew for llyr

  once almost human llyr at the end bore
no relation to anything remotely human

  the grinding millstones of chaos crushed
the three

  the thunder died

  before me stood the altar of llyr but it
held no window now all four sides were
of black dead stone

         chapter xvi
         self against self

blackness and black stones were the
last things i saw before dark oblivion
closed down over me like folding wings it
was as if llyrs terrible resistance was all
that had held me upright in the last fierce
stages of our struggle as he fell so fell
ganelon at the foot of the windowless altar

  how long i lay there i do not know but
slowly slowly caer llyr came back around
me and i knew i was lying prostrate upon
the altar i sat up painfully the dregs of
exhaustion still stiffening my body though
i knew i must have slept for that exhaustion
was no longer the overwhelming tide that
had flooded me as i fell

  beyond me at the head of the great steep
of stairs freydis lay half stretched upon
the steps as if she had striven to return to
her people in the moment before collapsing
her eyes were still bound and her mighty
arms lay flung out upon the platform all
strength drained from them by the fierceness

of our battle strangely as she lay there
she brought back to my double-minded
memories the thought of a figure from earth
-another mighty woman in white robes with
bandaged eyes and upraised arms blind
justice holding her eternal scales faintly i
smiled at the thought in the dark world-
my world now-justice was ganelon and
not blind

  freydis stirred one hand lifted uncer-
tainly to the cloth across her eyes i let her
waken presently we must struggle again
together justice and i but i did not doubt
who would prevail

  i rose to my knees and heard a silvery
tinkling as something slid in fragments from
my shoulder the mask broken when i fell
its crystal shards lay among those other
shards which had blasted llyr from the dark
world when the sword broke i thought of
the strange blue lightnings which had
wrought at last what no other thing in the
dark world could accomplish-llyrs de-
struction and i thought i understood

  he had passed too far beyond this world
ever to touch it except in the ceremonies of
the golden window man demon god mu-
tation into namelessness-whatever he had
been he had kept but one link with the dark
world which spawned him a link enshrined
in the sword called llyr by that talisman
he could return for the sacrifices which fed
him return for the great ceremonies of the
sealing that had made me half his own but
only by that talisman

  so it must be safely hidden to be his bridge
for the returning and safely hidden it was
without ghast rhymis knowledge who
could have found it without the strength
of the great lord ganelon-well yes and
the strength of freydis too-who could have
won close enough to the window to shatter
the sword upon the only thing in the dark
world that could break it yes llyr had
guarded his talisman as strongly as any
guard could be but vulnerable he was to the
one man who could wield that sword

  so the sword broke and the bridge be-
tween worlds broke and llyr was gone into
a chaos from which there could never be a
returning

  medea too-red witch of colchis lost love
drinker of life gone beyond recalling  t

  for a moment i closed my eyes

  well ganelon

  i looked up freydis was smiling grimly at
me from beneath the uplifted blindfold i
	startling stories

rose to my feet and watched in silence while
she got to hers triumph flooded through
me in great waves of intoxicating warmth
the world i had just wakened to was wholly
mine now and not this woman nor any other
human should balk me of my destiny had
i not vanquished llyr and slain the last of
the coven and was i not stronger in magic
than any man or woman now who walked
the dark world i laughed the deep sound
echoing from the high vaults about us and
rolling back in reverberant exultation until
that which had been caer llyr was alive
with the noise of my mirth but llyr was
here no longer

  let this be caer ganelon i said hear-
ing the echo of my own name come rolling
back as if the castle itself replied

  ganelon i shouted caer ganelon
i laughed to hear the whole vast hollow re-
peating my name while the echoes still
rolled i spoke to freydis

  you have a new master now you forest
people because you helped me you shall
be rewarded old woman but i am master
of the dark world-i ganelon and the
walls roared back to me ganelon-gane-
lon

  freydis smiled

  not so fast covenanter she said calmly
did you think i trusted you

  i gave her a scornful smile what can
you do to me now only one thing could
slay me before today-llyr himself now
llyr is gone and ganelon is immortal you
have no power to touch me sorceress

  she straightened on the step her ageless
face a little below mine there was a sure-
ness in her eyes that sent the first twinge
of uneasiness into my mind yet what i had
said was true for no one in the dark world
could harm me now yet freydis smile did
not waver

  once i sent you through limbo into the
earth world she said could you stop me
if i sent you there again

elief quieted my tremor of unease
tomorrow or the next day-yes i
could stop you today no but i am gane-
lon now and i know the way back i am
ganelon and forewarned and i think you
could not so easily send me earthward again
naked of memories and clothed in another
mans past i remember and i could return
you would waste your time and mine frey-
dis yet try it if you will and i warn you

i should be back again before your spell was
finished

  her quiet smile did not falter she folded
her arms hiding her hands in the flowing
sleeves she was very sure of herself

  you think you are a godling ganelon
she said you think no mortal power can
touch you now you have forgotten one
thing as llyr had his weakness as edeyrn

did	and medea and matholch so have you
covenanter in this world there is no man
to match you but in the earth world there
is lord ganelon in that world your equal
lives and i mean to call him out to fight one
last battle for the freedom of the dark world
edward bond could slay you ganelon

   i felt the blood leave my face a little wind
of chill like edeyms glance breathed over
me i had forgotten even llyr by his own
unimaginable hand could have died and i
could die by my own hand too or by the
hand of that other self who was edward
bond

  fool i said dotard have you forgot-
ten that bond and i can never stand in the
same world when i came he vanished out
of this land just as i must vanish if you
bring him here how can a man and his re-
flection ever come hand to hand how could
he touch me old woman

  easily she smiled very easily he
cannot fight you here nor in the earth world
that is true but limbo ganelon have you
forgotten limbo

  her hands came out of her sleeves there
was a rod of blinding silver in each before
i could stir she had brought the rods to-
gether crossing them before her smiling face
at the intersection forces of tremendous
power blazed into an instants being forces
that streamed from the poles of the world and
could touch only for the beat of a second if
that world were not to be shaken into frag-
ments i felt the building reel below me

   i felt the gateway open   

  here was grayness nothing but oblivion
made visible all around me i staggered with
the suddenness of it the shock and the ter-
rible tide of anger that came surging up
through my whole body at the knowledge of
freydis trickery it was not to be endured
this magicking of the dark worlds lord

i would fight my way back and the ven-
geance i would wreak upon freydis would be
a lesson to all

out of the greyness a mirror loomed be-
fore me a mirror i saw my own face be-
the dark world	

wildered uncomprehending staring back into
my eyes but i was not wearing the ragged
blue garments of sacrifice which i had donned
so many aeons ago in the castle of the
coven i seemed to wear earth garments
and i seemed not quite myself not quite
ganelon i seemed-

  edward bond said the voice of freydis
behind me

  the reflection of myself glanced across my
shoulder and a look of recognition and un-
utterable relief came over it

  freydis he cried in my own voice
freydis thank god ive tried so hard-
wait freydis stopped him listen
there is one last trial before you this man
is ganelon he has undone all your work
among the forest people he has slain llyr
and the coven there is none in the dark
world to stay his hand if he wins his way
back to it only you can stop him edward
bond only you

  i did not wait for her to say anything more

i	knew what must be done i lunged for-
ward before he could speak or stir and drove
a heavy blow into the face that might have
been my own it was a strange thing to do
it was a hard thing at the last moment my
muscles almost refused me for it was as if

i	struck myself

  i	saw him reel back and my own head
reeled in imagination so that the first blow
rocked us both

  he caught himself a dozen feet away and
stood for a moment unsteady on his feet
looking at me with a confusion that might
have been the mirror of my own face for i
knew there was confusion there too

  then anger flushed those bewildering fa-
miliar features and i saw blood break from
the comer of his mouth and trickle across

  his chin i laughed savagely that blood
somehow made him my enemy i had seen
the blood of enemies springing out in the
wake of my blows too often to mistake him
now for anything but what he was myself-
and my deadliest foe

  he dropped into a half-crouch and came
for me stooping to protect his body from
my fists i wished fervently for a sword or
a gun i have never cared for an equal fight
as ganelon does not fight for sport but to
win but this fight must be terribly unbe-
lievably equal

he dodged beneath my blow and i
 s felt the rocking jar of what seemed
to be my own fist jolting against my cheek-
bone he danced back light-footed out of

range

  rage came snarling up in my throat i
wanted nothing of this boxing this game
fought by rules ganelon fought to win i
roared at him from the full depth of my lungs
and hurled myself forward in a crushing em-
brace that carried us both heavily to the
grey sponginess that was limbos floor my
fingers sank delightfully in his throat i
groped savagely for his eyes he grunted
with effort and i felt his fist thud into my
ribs and felt the sharp white pain of break-
ing bone

  so wholly was he myself and i he that for
an instant i was not sure whose rib had
snapped beneath whose blow then i drew
a deep breath and sobbed it out again half
finished as pain like bright light flashed
through my body and i knew it was my own
rib

  the knowledge maddened me careless of
pain or caution i drove my fists savagely into

what would happen if civilization were

have always wondered what would happen to the sur-
vivors were our present civilization destroyed-and humanity
thrown back upon the none-too-gentle arms of nature who
would then be the leaders in the race how would the survivors
meet the onslaughts of the elements and of wild beasts

him at blind random feeling exultantly the
crackle of bone beneath my knuckles the
spurt of blood over my hard-clenched hands
we strove together in a terrible locked em-
brace there upon the floor of limbo in a
nightmare that had no real being except for
the pain shooting through me after each
breath

  but in a moment or two i knew somehow
very surely that i was his master and this
is how i knew he rolled half over to jab a
hard blow into my face and before the blow
began i had blocked it i had known he
squirmed from beneath me and braced him-
self to strike me again in the ribs and before
he could strike i had twisted sidewise away
again i had known

  for i had been edward bond once in every
way that matters i had lived in his memory
and his world and i knew edward bond as
i knew myself instinct seemed to tell me
what he would do next he could not out-
think me and so he could not hope to out-
fight me to whom his every thought was re-
vealed in the moment before he could act
upon it

  even in the pain of my broken rib i
laughed then freydis had overreached her-
self at last in smothering ganelon under
edward bonds memories in the earth world
she had given me the means to vanquish him
now he was mine to finish when i chose
and the dark world was mine and edward
bond kingdom of free people was mine too
and edward bonds lovely pale-haired bride
and everything that might have been his
own

  i laughed exultantly and twisted in three
perfectly timed motions that blocked and
overbalanced the man who was myself throe
motions only-and then i had him across my
knee taut-stretched his spine pressing hard
against my thigh

  i grinned down at him my blood dripped
into his face i saw it strike there and i met
his eyes and then strangely for one flashing
instant i knew a fierce yearning for
dfeat in that instant i prayed voicelessly
to a nameless god that edward bond
might yet save himself and ganelon might

die	  

  i called forth all the strength that was in
me and limbo swam redly before my eyes
and the pain of my broken rib was a lance
of white light as i drew the deep breath that
was edward bonds last

  i broke his back across my knee

          chapter xvii
          freedom at last

hurriedly two cold smooth hands
pressed hard upon my forehead i
looked up they slid lower covering my
eyes and weakness was like a blanket over
me i knelt there unresisting feeling the
body of the man who had been myself slide
limply from my knee

 freydis pressed me down we lay side by
 side the living and the dead

 the silver rods of the sorceress touched
 my head and made a bridge between ed-
 ward bond and ganelon i remembered
 medeas wand that could draw the life-force
 from the mind a dull numbing paralysis
 had me little tingling shocks rippled
 through my nerves and i could not move

 sudden agonizing pain shot through me
 my back i tried to scream with the white
 fury of that wrenching agony but my throat
 was frozen i felt edward bonds wounds

 in that nightmare moment while my brain
 spun down the limitless corridors of a science
 beyond that of mankind i knew what frey-
 dis had done-what she was doing

 i felt the mind of edward bond come
 back from the gulfs side by side we lay
 in flesh and side by side in spirit as well

 there was blackness and two flames burn-
 ing with a cold clear fire   

 one was the mind-the life-of edward
 bond one was my life

 the flames bent toward each other

 they mingled and were one

 life and soul and mind of edward bond
 merged with life of ganelon

 where two flames had burned there was
 one now one only

 and the identity of ganelon ebbed sank
    faded into a graying shadow as the fires
 of edward bonds life leaped ever higher

 we were one we were-

 edward bond no longer ganelon no
 longer lord of the dark world master of
 the caers

 magic of freydis drowned the soul of
 ganelon and gave his body to the life of ed-
 ward bond

 i saw ganelon-die   

   

 when i opened my eyes again i knelt up-
 on the altar that had been llyrs the empty
the dark world



 vaults towered hollowly above us limbo
 was gone the body across my knee was
 gone freydis smiled down at me with her
 ageless timeless smile

  welcome back to the dark world ed-
ward bond

  yes it was true i knew that i knew my
own identity housed though it was in anoth-
er mans body dizzily i blinked shook my
head and rose slowly pain struck savagely
at my side and i gasped and let freydis
spring forward to support me on one great
white arm while the hollow building reeled
about me but ganelon was gone he had
vanished with limbo vanished like a scatter
of smoke vanished as if the prayer he
breathed in his extremity had been answered
by the nameless god he prayed to

  i was edward bond again

  do you know why ganelon could break
you edward bond freydis said softly
do you know why you could not vanquish
him it was not what he thought i know
he believed he read your mind because he
had dwelt there but that was not the reason
when a man fights himself my son the same
man does not fight to win only the suicide
hates himself deep within ganelon lay the
knowledge of his own evil and the hatred
of it so he could strike his own image and
exult in the blow because he hated himself
in the depths of his own mind

  but you had earned your own respect
you could not strike as hard as he because
you are not evil and ganelon won-and
lost in the end he did not fight me he had

slain himself and the man who does that
has no combat left in him

  her voice sank to a murmur then she
laughed

  go out now edward bond there is
much to be done in the dark world

  so leaning upon her arm i went down
the long steps that ganelon had climbed i
saw the green glimmer of the day outside the
shimmer of leaves the motion of waiting
people i remembered all that ganelon had
remembered but upon the mind of ganelon
the mind of edward bond was forever super-
imposed and i knew that only thus could the
dark world be ruled

  the two together twinned forever in one
body and the control forever mine-edward
bonds

  we came out under the emptied arch of
the opening and daylight was blinding for
a moment after that haunted darkness then
i saw the foresters anxiously clustering in
their battered ranks around the caer and i
saw a pale girl in green haloed by her
floating hair turn a face of incredulous radi-
ance to mine

  i forgot the pain in my side

  arles hair swam like mist about us both
as my arms closed around her the roar of
exultation that went up from the forest
people swept the clearing and made the
great caer behind us echo through all its
hollow vaults

  the dark world was free and ours

  but medea medea red witch of colchis

    endowed with super-vision reporter david winn leorns
    the awesome and terrifying secret of seeing too much

dr jackson ho-
mer tall and thin
and gray listened in half-
fascinated doubt to his
callers rush of words
they swept on quick
eager convincing he was
young this dark-haired
vivid-faced fellow who
had given his name as
david winn his argu-
ments rang with the confidence of youth as
yet unacquainted with defeat

  winn gesticulated motioned colorfully to
drive home his arguments his clear voice
echoed from the walls of dr homers long
laboratory set delicate brass and nickel in-
struments on the shelves and vessels of shim-
mering glass on the tables to quivering drift-
ed out of the open window to be lost in the
morning confusion of a sunny crosstown
street of new york

  you cant refuse winn asserted it
means a human being to test your process on
and you admit that you want to try it on a
human

  i would like to very much yes dr ho-
mer sighed it would complete my investi-
gation but i had not thought of being able
to do so until you volunteered-the risks-

 what risks challenged young david
winn youve done the thing to a dozen ani-
mals from dog to monkey havent you with-
out changing anything in them except their
eyesight

  the eyesight alteration is change enough
dr homer said you say that you are a
newspaper reporter and not a scientist do
you realize exactly what my process in-
volves

  of course i do david winn answered
i read the newspaper accounts of it thor-
oughly from the first mention of your work
that appeared three months ago

  that first article said that you dr homer
the eminent biologist of manhattan founda-

tion believed that you could change the eyes
of animals so that they could see through
stone and metal and such substances as easily
as through glass

  you proposed to do this by making the
retinas of those animals eyes sensitive to cer-
tain ultra-violet vibrations instead of light-
vibrations they would see by these ultra-
violet radiations instead of by light and since
all inorganic matter is transparent to these
particular vibrations so would it be trans-
parent to their eyes

  dr homer nodded

yes that was a fairly correct statement
of my purpose in undertaking this series of
experiments i was sure i could make animal
eyes capable of seeing through solid matter
winn leaned forward

  then two weeks ago the papers said that
you had succeeded you had so changed the
sensitivity of the eyes of several animals that
they saw by the ultra-violet waves and could
look straight through stone or metal or any
inorganic substance they could not see
through living things or matter derived from
living things as these particular vibrations
would not penetrate organic matter

  that article added that you were of the
opinion that you could change human eyes
in just the same way by altering the retinas
sensitivity and that a man whose eyes were
so treated could see through stone and brick
walls through metal of any kind in fact
could see through almost everything except
living beings and such part of their clothing
and possessions as were of organic matter

  david winns face lit

  thats why i came here to volunteer as a
test-subject for your process i want you to
change my eyes so that i too will be able to
look through solid matter as though it didnt
exist

  but why dr homer asked him keenly

just why do you want this power of looking
through doors and walls at will

  not for criminal purposes if that is what
you are thinking of winn told him

  yes that is what was in my mind dr
homer admitted i can take no chance of
turning loose on this city a criminal who is
able to see through its walls as though they
were glass

  i can satisfy you that ive no criminal
ideas david winn assured him i told you
i was a newspaper reporter im a young one
an inexperienced one but once i had this
power i would be the greatest reporter
who ever lived

  do you see what i mean if i can look
	 startling stories

through walls and see what people are doing
behind closed doors i can get stories no other
reporter can get i can even see what people
are saying behind closed doors-ive prac-
ticed lip-reading during the last few weeks
in anticipation

the young mans face gleamed enthusi-
asm in his eyes as he bent forward dr
homer considered him

  so that is it-you want my process to
make you the reporter who sees everything
thats what i want to see everything
winn declared why within weeks this
power of mine would bring me a better job
and a bigger salary than any other reporter
in the country

  you wish me to change your eyesight be-
cause it will bring you a larger salary the
scientist asked you must want that in-
creased salary very badly

  david winn smiled

  i do and the reason is the usual one-a
girl marta ray and i are very much in love
with each other but a cubs salary wouldnt
be much when were married but on the
salary ill make when i start seeing through
doors and walls-

  and youre willing to undergo this change
of eyesight to get that dr homer comment-
ed you understand once your eyes were
changed in this way the process could not be
undone

  why should anyone want it undone
winn countered if i can just get that pow-
er ill be satisfied to keep it and to use it
dr homer thought in silence for a time
his brows knit he looked out through the
window at the noisy morning traffic in the
street below from the window his gaze
went to a long white table over whose end
was suspended an upright mechanism of
brass and steel and quartz

  the scientist walked over to the instru-
ment fingered its connections david winn
watched him intently dr homer suddenly
turned

  i am going to use the process on your
eyes winn he said but there are condi-
tions

  he raised a rigid finger

  first if the process does succeed with
your eyes you are to tell absolutely no one
of your power

  i agree to that winn said quickly and
decisively

  second you will promise never to use

that power for criminal or vindictive pur-
poses

  i do promise david winn told him and
now youll do the thing at once

  i might as well said the scientist he
seemed torn by doubts i dont know-i may
be doing wrong in this but ive got to see if
the human retina reacts like the others

  yes ill do it at once he went on the
process will take less than two hours-of
course youll have to be anaesthetized during
it

  under his direction david winn removed
coat and vest and climbed up onto the white
table and stretched out

  dr homer swung the suspended instru-
ment over him carefully adjusted its tubes
until twin quartz lenses were directly over
the eyes of the prostrate young man he then
placed ready on a smaller table glass con-
tainers of pink and green solutions instru-
ments and droppers

  he swung the tube of an anaesthetic-gas
apparatus toward winns face then held its
rubber nose-piece in his hand

  all ready he said

  all ready david winn smiled if all
goes well ill be seeing you-and much else
-in two hours

  dr homer nodded

  if all goes well he repeated here goes

  the gas-apparatus hissed   

  david winn opened his eyes and looked up
from the table on which he lay he saw the
anxious face of dr homer bending over
him there seemed a faint violet tinge in the
light but david winn could see no other
change had the process failed

  then as he looked up past dr homers
face he gasped he was looking up through
the ceiling of the laboratory as though no
ceiling was there he was looking up at the
bottom of a table several chairs and two
white-coated scientists busy with flames and
tubes all seemingly suspended miraculously
in the air a dozen feet above him

  and above these in turn david winn
could see other objects and other men sus-
pended in the same way level above level
he could see as clearly as though the ceilings
and floors dividing them did not exist far up
through the great buildings many levels to
the open air

  then the explanation came in full force to
david winns half-dazed mind he struggled
up to a sitting position

  you did it then he exclaimed the
the man with x-ray eyes	

process succeeded

  did it dr homer asked him keenly
has your vision changed any

  changed winn drew a long breath ill
say that its changed why i can see through
the ceilings above and the walls and even
this table im sitting on as though they didnt
exist

it was true to david winns eyes the
walls floors and ceilings of the building
had vanished he could see up through level
above level into the open air in each level
he saw only the human beings their clothing
wooden doors and tables only organic mat-
ter

  he could look down through similar levels
to the surface of the ground below it oc-
curred to him that he saw the ground only
because it was so intermixed with organic
matter in its upper layer

 dr homer helped him to clamber down
from the metal table winn seemed to him-
self to be standing on empty space the tile
floor invisible to his sight it was an eerie
sensation

  he took a few steps tentatively across the
room and blundered into something invisible
that upset with a crash

  winn made a wry face

  ill have to look out for metal furniture
wont i but its wonderful-wonderful-
dr homers face held excitement

  you can see only organic matter then
the same as my animal subjects

  just the same said david winn elation
was beginning to replace his bewilderment
think of it im looking straight through the
walls the reporter who can see through
walls

  youve no regrets then that you under-
went the process the scientist asked and
winn laughed

  regrets i wish that id been born this
way im going to see the world as it really is
from now on and not just the walls behind
which it hides

  he put on his hat and maneuvered to the
door dr homer helping him he grasped
the invisible door-knob	v

  ill be back tomorrow to make whatever
scientific tests you want doctor just now
im eager to make use of my power

  be careful dr homer warned take it
easy until you learn how to navigate

  david winn closed the door walked down
a hall and invisible stairs carefully and

emerged into the street

 crowded new york was an astounding
spectacle to his eyes now that he saw only the
living and organic matter in it

  the great buildings of stone and steel had
largely vanished to his sight and he now saw
only the level above level of working people
and miscellaneous organic objects they con-
tained

  he could see none of the automobiles and
buses thronging the street before him his
eyes beheld only groups of people in sitting
posture rushing to and fro suspended in the
air

  he set off for his newspaper-office it was
but two blocks away but before he reached
it david winn had almost been run down at
intersections by two taxicabs invisible to his
eyes had been roundly cursed by a man
pushing a metal hand-truck along the side-
walk which he had run into and had tripped
twice over objects he could not see

  when he got into the city-room of his pa-
per it presented as weird an appearance as
the street men sat at desks invisible to his
eyes using invisible telephones and type-
writers winn threaded cautiously through
them to the city editors desk

  the editor ray lanham looked up as he
approached and tossed a scrap of paper
toward him

  where have you been all morning winn
he asked heres a fist of some of the most
prominent men in the city i want you to get
as many of them as you can to state their
opinion on the latest disclosures of civic
graft

  this assignment ought to be easy enough
for you lanham added phone in what
you get in time for the rewrite

  david winn smiled as he pocketed the slip
of paper

  dont hunt easy assignments for me for
from now on im the best reporter youve
got he said in one week all the news-
papers in this town will be begging me to
work for them  

  grinning to himself at the editors dumb-
founded face he walked out of the office and
reached the street

  when he saw a taxi-driver sailing along
amid the weird throng of rushing figures in
the street david winn hailed him and en-
tered the cab he could not see he sped down-
town in eerie progress

  the first name on his list was that of roscoe
saul ton candidate for governor winn left
startling stories



the cab at the saulton campaign headquar-
ters and found his way up through the in-
visible walls and stairs and floors to the suite
of offices he wished to reach

  he found two other newspapermen waiting
to see roscoe saulton on the same matter
and saulton was just appearing from the in-
ner offices his big good-humored face was
wreathed in a welcoming smile

  his face sobered as david winn put his
question it became almost stern

  i have only the strongest condemnation
for all forms of civic graft he declared
this rottenness that has been uncovered in
our body politic must be destroyed

  can we quote you as saying that if elected
you will do all in your power to cleanse mu-
nicipal politics one of the reporters asked

  saulton nodded vigorously

  you may and i hope that you make it em-
phatic i am seeking the office of governor
only that i may serve the people and i know
no better way to serve them than to smash
this political ring of chicanery and fraud that
has long disgraced this city

  he shook hands heartily with them

  good day gentlemen-and remember that

i	am always glad to see you

as roscoe saulton returned to the inner
offices and the other two newspaper-
men went out david winn lingered

  he could look through the walls into the
inner office to which saulton had gone and
could see saulton and the half-dozen other
cigar-smoking men in that office as clearly
as though the intervening walls did not exist

  winn could see the movement of their lips
and read from it what they were saying
saulton had sunk into a chair and was speak-
ing to one of the others

  more damn reporters to get my opinion on
graft he was saying theyve kept me busy
damning the organization up and down all
morning

  the other men grinned

  dont damn it too hard when youre rely-
ing on it to put you into office next month
saulton one of them said

  another contradicted

  go as far as you like with your denuncia-
tions he advised the candidate it doesnt
hurt the organization a bit and it will get you
votes

  well once im in the governors chair

ii	give short shrift to these pussyfooting re-
foianers roscoe saulton growled but right

now ive got to coddle them along worse
luck

  david winns absorbed watch was inter-
rupted by a secretary who came up to him
in the outer office

  is anything the matter the man asked
youve been staring at the wall for min-
utes

  winn turned oh just a little absent-
minded i guess good day

  winn walked out of the building to the
street he felt disgusted to the core of his
being

  so this was roscoe saulton the guberna-
torial candidate whose integrity was unques-
tioned a pseudo-reformer who denounced
political graft even while he used it to reach
office

  others everyone might be taken in but
the truth could not be hidden from the eyes
of david winn he had looked through the
walls behind which saulton thought himself
secure had seen the real roscoe saulton

  he looked at the next name on his list it
was that of james willingdon financier and
mining-magnate and philanthropist whose
eminence was known over the whole nation
winn got another cab to take him to willing-
don and companys wall street offices

  he was passed through a half-dozen secre-
taries and underlings until he at last reached
the office of james willingdons personal sec-
retary and explained his errand the secre-
tary was beautifully courteous

  mr willingdon is engaged in an impor-
tant business conference but i will see
whether he can see you for a moment will
you please wait here

  david winn looked after the secretary as
he went through an invisible wall into the
next office there were a dozen men in that
room gathered round a long table winn saw
them as clearly as though there were no wall
separating them

  he saw james willingdon himself at the
head of the table a man of fifty with a gray
face steely gray eyes and a straight erect
figure willingdon was speaking to the others
at the table

  winn could read the movement of his ups
as clearly as though he were hearing the
words issuing from them

  i tell you its the best proposition any of
us have ever had james willingdon was
saying we announce united mines and
with our names and the publicity well give
it the public will fall over itself to buy the
the man with x-ray eyes	

stock when its gone high enough well un-
load without warning

  what if the public learns what has hap-
pened afterward a tall anxious-looking
man queried we wouldnt be very popular
i can assure you

  theres no chance theyll even suspect
well simply assert that bear raiders broke
the stocks value and that we lost more than
anyone else james willingdon answered
theyll never question it any more than they
ever have before

  very well were with you willingdon
another said but remember no double-
crossing-we sell at the same time

  the personal secretary who had been hov-
ering close by came quickly forward and
spoke to the financier

  david winn saw willingdon excuse him-
self to the others and come into the room
where he waited

  james willingdons face wore a smile of
perfect-seeming sincerity as he shook winns
hand

  i can spare you only a moment mr
winn he said for some of my associates
and i are busy planning a project that will
mean great things for this country-yes
great things

  but my secretary said that you wanted
my opinion of the recent graft-disclosures
and my duty as a citizen comes before all
else as a citizen of this municipality i want
to put on record my utter detestation of all
such wrong-doing as has just been disclosed
david winn went out of the place with a
bitter smile so james willingdon great
financier and revered philanthropist was-
just a crook just another like roscoe saul-
ton

it came to winn as he emerged into the
street that his new eyesight gave him
more than the power to look through walls
-it gave with it the power to look through
the falsities of ordinary existence into the
true hearts of men

  ten minutes later david winn was putting
his question to the third man on his list one
of the overlords of the clothing industry

  the clothing-magnate spoke eloquently
against civic corruption he dwelt on the
horror of defrauding poor as well as rich he
mentioned lincoln and washington but
david winn was not listening

  the offices of this man were on the ground
floor of the great block of buildings that

housed his shops winn looked through the
offices walls as though they did not exist
was staring into those far-stretching factory-
divisions

  he saw the long rows of pinched-looking
pale-faced girls and women bent over ma-
chines working like so many automatons
without looking up he saw panting youths
struggling with hand-trucks of clothing and
fabrics and furs through ill-lit ill-ventilated
corridors and rooms

  winn avoided shaking hands with the de-
nouncer of graft and escaped into the street
he felt a revulsion

  he walked along the street forgetting his
further names for the time and found himself
passing a curious structure

  its walls were transparent to his eyes like
those of all the other buildings in sight of
course but its interior seemed divided into
a great number of very small rooms

  there were men crowded in nearly all the
rooms as far back into the structure as he
saw some of the men lay in stupefied sleep
others gazed longingly into the streets

  it was a prison winn saw the guards in the
corridors between the cells the debased char-
acter of many of the occupants the uncon-
querable dirtiness as clearly as though there
were no walls and bars between

  he had many times passed the stately gray
stone building before but never until now
had he seen through the stone front to the
foulness and misery within he passed hur-
riedly on

  but the next building was worse it was a
large hospital he had passed this too many
times in the past and had admired the neat-
ness of the big brick building with its gleam-
ing sun-rooms and other rooms showing their
expanse of shining glass window

  but now david winns eyes saw nothing of
the neat brick walls the glistening glass he
looked through brick and plaster and metal
to the buildings interior he saw long rows
of mattresses resting on beds he could not
see hundreds of them

  men and women were stretched upon them
and children too some were tossing fever-
ishly in the grip of dread diseases other
shrieked in the agony of pain he could see
men whose limbs were but bandaged stumps
could see children lying supine in casts

  he gazed up through the level on level of
rows of beds and sufferers to the operating-
rooms glimpsed the flash of steel instruments
suddenly reddened he saw the sheet being
	startling stories

drawn over the faces of suddenly quiet fig-
ures beheld new sufferers being brought has-
tily in from the ambulances at the rear sick
and shaken david winn stumbled on

  he passed quickly the adjoining insanity-
hospital turning his head away from the
building through whose transparent walls he
could see men and women tearing at the bars
of their cells and at themselves or sitting
and staring droolingly into nothingness he
kept his eyes averted until he had turned the
comer

  the grotesque spectacle of the city hummed
and swarmed in the warm afternoon sunlight
as he went down this street he hardly knew
now where he was going hardly was aware
of the weirdness of the spectacle that the
street presented to his eyes in his soul a
horror was expanding that he could not con-
quer

  now it was a section of the slum-district
through which he was passing but he did
not see it as it appeared to the eyes of others
in the street a narrow thoroughfare lined
with dingy brick-fronted tenements and
noisy with children playing on the worn cob-
bles he was seeing what lay behind the din-
gy building-fronts

  david winns eyes beheld an unimagined
dirtiness and squalor through the walls that
were transparent to them he saw large fam-
ilies crowded into a single room with shabby
mattresses piled in a corner showing on what
they slept at night he saw scavenging chil-
dren returning triumphantly home with re-
volting food

  in those rabbit-warrens of filth and dark-
ness his super-penetrating vision descried
every species of crime breeding and taking
place men and women sodden with poison-
ous liquor he saw and others pale and flac-
cid from the drugs they took as he watched
children were deftly instructed in crime in
places whose walls could not bar the gaze of
david winn

  winn tried to tell himself that all this had
always been that it was only because he now
saw it all that he was so shaken with horror
but it was unavailing wherever his steps
took him wherever his eyes turned he looked
through walls into some new nest of pain or
foulness or crime hidden from the light of
day

  he was sick sick unto his soul why he
cried to himself had he ever been so mad as
to let his eyes be changed why had he not
realized what it would mean all the wretch-

edness and wrong-doing and horror of life
that was hidden from other men by walls
would always be staring him in the face he
would see them always with eyes that pene-
trated all concealment

  if his eyes could be changed back to their
former state if the process could be undone-
but no it could never be undone dr homer
had warned of that he would always be like
this always descrying through any conceal-
ment the horror hidden from all others

but if he could get away with marta
david winns heart leapt to catch at
the sudden gleam of hope in the country
there would be fewer walls less hidden
things they could be married and go there
to live just he and marta together marta
loved him and would understand-

  he would go to her explain to her fever-
ishly david winn walked northward until
he came to the apartment-building he sought
he raced up the invisible stairs and along the
hall his hand was raised to knock on marta
rays door but he paused as he looked
through the transparent wall and saw marta
and her mother

  they were talking and their faces were
turned half toward him david winn read
their lips as clearly as though he heard their
speech

  he said that if his plans worked out we
could be married quite soon marta was say-
ing

  the mother sniffed

  why you have anything to do with him
i dont know david winn has nothing and
never will have anything

  oh dont start that again mother marta
ray said wearily i know david doesnt
amount to much

  then why are you going to marry him
her mother demanded

  because david is the best i can get i have
to marry someone dont i said the girl dis-
contentedly

  david winn stood quite motionless outside
the door for some moments then he turned
and with his face white and strange went
softly down the stairs   

  the police sergeant that night was explain-
ing to dr homer as he led him back along a
corridor to the morgue-room

  we found your name and address in his
pocket when we fished his body out of the
river and thought maybe you could identify
him he was saying
the man with x-ray eyes



  dr homer stepped into the morgue-room
and as the sheet was thrown back he looked
steadily at the drowned man

  he lay with body tensed and with one
hand flung palm-outward against his face
across his eyes

  funny thing about that arm the sergeant
remarked when we found him his hand
was up in front of his eyes like that and we
couldnt move it away

 looks just like he was trying to keep from
 seeing something doesnt it

dr homer nodded sadly as he looked at
david winn

 he was trying to keep from seeing every-
 thing for he saw everything just as he want-
 ed to and it was too much for him

 god keep us blind in this world prevent
 us from the horror of doing what he did of
 seeing too well

planet of the black dust

by jack vance

        the pirates held all the cards but one-the soul of
        a man who was determined not to let them win

about the middle of the dog watch
captain creed came up on the bridge
of the space-freighter perseus he
walked to the forward port and stood gazing
at the blood-red star which lay ahead and
slightly to the left

  it was a nameless little sun in the tail of
the serpens group isolated from the usual
space routes the earth-rasalague route
ran far to one side the delta aquila ran far
to the other and the delta aquila-sabik
inter-sector service was yet a half light-year
further out

  captain creed stood watching the small
red star deep in thought-a large man with
a paunch a bland white face a careful coal-
black beard his heavy black eyes under-
hung with dark circles were without expres-
sion or life he wore a neat black suit his
boots shone with a high polish his hands
were white and immaculately kept

  captain creed was more than mere master
of the perseus in partnership with his
brother he owned the european-arcturus
line-a syndicate impressive to the ear

  the home office however was one dingy

tlie tall black body crumbled as tna needle-bcam spoke
planet of the black dust



room in the old co-martian tower in tran
and the firms sole assets consisted first of
the perseus itself and second of the profit
anticipated from a cargo of aromatic oils
which captain creed had taken on consign-
ment from mcvanns star in ophiuchus

  the perseus could not be considered the
more valuable of the two items it was an
old ship slow pitted by meteorites of little
more than  tons capacity

  the cargo was another matter-flask upon
flask of rare aromatics essence of syrang
blooms oil of star-poppies attar of green
orchids musk of crushed mian flies distilla-
tion of mcvanns blue bush-exotic liquids
brought in by the bulb-men of mcvanns
star a half ounce at a time and captain
creed was highly annoyed when the insur-
ance evaluator permitted but an eighty-
million-dollar policy and had argued ve-
hemently to have the figure moved closer
to the cargos true value

  now as he stood on the bridge smoking
his cigar he was joined by the first mate
blaine who was tall and thin and except
for a scrub of black hair egg-bald blaine
had a long knife-nose a mouth twisted to a
perpetual snarl he had a quick reckless way
of talking that sometimes disconcerted care-
ful captain creed

  theyre all fixed he announced theyll
go in about ten minutes- captain creed
quelled him with a frown and a quick mo-
tion of the head and blaine saw that they
were not alone holderlin second mate and
quartermaster a young man of hard face
and cruel blue eyes stood forward at the
helm

  he wore only loose tattered trousers and
the scarlet glare from the star ahead gave a
devilish red glow to his body put a lurid cast
on his face like two hawks they watched
him and his expression did not entirely re-
assure them after a moment captain creed
spoke smoothly

  i doubt if you are right mr blaine the
period of that type of variable star is slower
and more even as i think youll find if you
check your observations

  blaine shot another quick look at holder-
lin then mumbling indistinguishably left
for the engine room

  creed presently stepped across the bridge

  take her five degrees closer to the star
mr holderlin were somewhat offcourse
and the gravity will swing us back around

  holderlin gave him one look of surprise
then silently obeyed what nonsense was
this already the ship was gripped hard by
gravity did they still hope to beguile him
with such slim pretexts if so they must
think him stupid indeed

  even a child would by now have been
warned by the happenings aboard the

perseus first at porphyry the space-port
on mcvanns star captain creed had dis-
charged the radioman and the two ships
mechanics for reasons unexplained

  not an unusual circumstance but captain
creed had neglected to hire replacements
thus the only other man aboard beside
captain creed blaine and holderlin was
farjoram the half-mad callistonian cook

n several occasions after porphyry
had been cleared holderlin had sur-
prised blaine and creed intent at the radio
later when he inspected the automatic
frequency record he found no trace of calls

  and four or five days ago while on
watch below and supposedly asleep he had
noticed while leaving his tiny compartment
that the entrance port to the starboard life-
boat was ajar he had said nothing but
later when blaine and captain creed were
both asleep had inspected the life-boats
port and starboard to find that the fuel in
the starboard life-boat had been drained ex-
cept for the slightest trickle and that the
radio transmitter had been tampered with

  the port boat was well fueled and pro-
visioned so holderlin quietly refueled the
starboard boat and thoughtfully stowed away
spare fuel

  now came blaines unwary statement to
captain creed and creeds peculiar orders
to steer toward the star holderlins tough
brown face was unexpressive as he watched
creeds great bulk by the port blotting owt
the sun ahead

  but his brain searched through all angles
of the situation for fourteen years of his
thirty-three he had roved space and of ne-
cessity had learned how to care for robert
holderlin

  a slight shock shook the hull captain
creed turned his head negligently then once
again looked out on space holderlin said
nothing but his eyes were very alert

  a few minutes passed and blaine came
back to the bridge holderlin sensed but
did not see the look which passed between
creed and the gaunt mate

  ah said captain creed we seem to
be close enough starboard ten degrees and
set her on the gyroscope

  holderlin turned the wheel he could feel
the surge of power into the jets but the ship
did not respond

  she doesnt answer sir he said

  whats this cried captain creed mr
blaine check the steering jets the ship
does not answer the wheel

  creed must dislike too blunt action
thought holderlin to insist on such elaborate
circumstances-or perhaps they suspected
the gun in his pocket blaine ran off and
returned in a very short time a wolfish grin
	startling stories

lifting his already contorted lip

  steering jets fused captain that cheap
lining they put in at aureolis has given
out

  captain creed looked from the furious lit-
tle sun ahead to blaine and holderlin with
his entire fortune at stake he seemed
strangely unperturbed by the prospect of
disaster but then captain creeds white
face was always controlled he gave the
order that holderlin had been expecting

  abandon ship he said mr blaine
despatch the distress signal mr holderlin
find farjoram and stand by the starboard
life-boat

  holderlin left to find the cook but he
noted as he passed that blaine at the trans-
mitter had not yet flipped down the big red
emergency relay

  presently captain creed and blaine joined
holderlin and the cook on the boat walk

  shall i accompany your boat captain or
mr blaines asked holderlin as if he had
not understood captain creeds previous
order or was challenging it blaine looked in
sudden alarm at the captain

  you will take charge of the starboard
boat mr holderlin replied the captain
silkily i wish mr blaine to accompany
me he turned to enter the pott boat but
holderlin stepped forward and produced a
sheet of paper he had been carrying for
several days

  a moment if you please sir if i am to
be in charge of the boat for the protection of
myself and the cook-in the event your boat
is lost-will you sign this certification of
shipwreck

  neither boat will be lost mr holderlin
replied captain creed smoothing his black
beard mr blaine contacted a patrol
cruiser only a hundred million miles away

  nevertheless sir i believe the astro-
nautic code requires such a document

  blaine nudged the captain slyly

  well certainly mr holderlin we must
observe the law said captain creed and
so signed the certification without more
ado he and blaine entered their lifeboat

  take off mr holderlin captain creed
ordered through the port we will wait till
you clear

wolderlin turned the cook had dis-
    appeared

  farjoram he cried farjoram

  holderlin ran to find him and at last dis-
covered the fuzzy-skinned little callistonian
huddled in his cabin red eyes bulging in
great terror there was foam at his mouth

  come said holderlin gruffly

  the callistonian babbled in frenzy

  no no-i not go in life-boat get away
you go  stay

  then holderlin remembered a tale which
had gone the rounds of how this farjoram
and eight others had drifted in a life-boat
for four months through the phenesian
blackness when at last they had been
picked up there was only farjoram among
the picked bones of his fellows so now even
holderlin shuddered

  hurry came captain creeds call we
are almost into the sun

  come said holderlin roughly theyll
kill you if you dont

  for answer the callistonian whipped out a
long knife and spasmodically stabbed himself
in the throat he fell at holderlins feet
holderlin returned alone

 wheres farjoram queried creed
sharply

  he killed himself sir with a knife

 humph murmured creed well take
off alone then the rendezvous is at a hun-
dred million miles on the line between this
star and delta aquila

  right sir said holderlin without furth-
er words he sealed himself in the boat and
took off

  the sun was close but not too close it
would have pulled an unfueled life-boat to
doom but it was not so near as to prevent
another ship from approaching the perse us
shackling into the fore and aft chocks and
towing it off to safety

  holderlin used his blasts for a few seconds
then cut them as if his fuel were exhausted
presently as he drifted away from the
perseus apparently helpless in the red stars
gravity he saw the port boat break clear
and speed not out toward delta aquila but
back along the blast-track

  holderlin drifted quietly a few minutes
in the event that captain creed or blaine
were watching him through glasses but
there was little time to waste tie ship lying
astern would presently draw alongside and
after transferring the precious cargo would
let the perseus hurtle into the scarlet sun

  holderlin had different plans he assured
himself that the certificate signed by captain
creed was safe-then judging the interval
to be adequate started his blasts and whisked
himself back to the perseus

  he brought the bow of the lifeboat against
the perseus forward tow ring then slipped
into his air-suit clambered out into space
and shackled the two together then back
in the life-boat he eased open the throttle
and nudged the bow of the perseus to a safe
position of space

  he pushed himself across the emptiness
this time to the perseus entrance port and
shedding his space-suit ran up to the bridge
he sent out a detector wave and the almost
instant contact bell told him the other ship
stood close-too close for flight to the only
planet of the black dust	

refuge he could think of-the lone planet of
the red star

  he picked up this ship in the teleview it
was a long black vessel with high-straked
bow great thick-ribbed tubes and a bridge
built smooth into the hull holderlin instant-
ly recognized the type-a class of fast
heavily-armed ships designed for the scorpio
sagittarius frontier run built by the belisar-
ius corporation of earth

  two years before he had shipped aboard
one of the same class and he recollected an
incident of the voyage out past fomalhaut
they were engaged in a running battle with
a war-sphere of the clantlalan system and
there had been a lucky shot into the main
generator which had put them out of action

  only the arrival of three earth cruisers had
staved off capture and slavery holderlin
recollected the exact details of that lucky
shot the bolt had struck amidships just
forward of the lower drive-jet it had broken
into the hull through a small drain the
achilles heel of the heavy armor

  so holderlin watched and waited as the
sleek black vessel cruised close the lifeboat
dangling against the perseus bow was turned
partly away in the shadow and was he
hoped not too conspicuous

  but the ship came easing up with an in-
solent leisure and there seemed to be no
suspicions aboard holderlins hard face
creased in a grin as he sighted along the
perseus ancient needle-beam

he encounter was of dream-like simplic-
ity like a tremendous black shark the
ship drifted over him her little black drain
drawing the sights of his needle-beam like
a magnet

  he pulled the trigger and laughed aloud as
a great hole opened where the drain had once
been as before the lights died the driving
beams cut off all evidence of life vanished
and the black ship rolled sluggishly in recoil
from the blast a great helpless hulk

  holderlin ran to the bank of jet controls
he could consider himself safe now for at
least a few hours when with luck he would
be so well concealed that the black ship
could seek in vain and if those aboard were
not able to rig up an auxiliary generator
quickly they themselves might be forced to
take to their life-boats-for the red star
glowed close ahead

  he threw on acceleration and with the life-
boat dragging crazily from the bow blasted
away toward the lone planet of the scarlet
sun

  an hour later the planet loomed large
and he entered the green-tinted atmosphere
in order to escape the teleview plates of
the raider he circled to the far side nudging
the perseus bow around with the lifeboat

  through his own teleview the planet
showed as a world of about half earths size
scarred with gorges and precipitous crags
interspersed with plains ttiese plains
brimmed with a black froth which the tele-
view presently revealed to be thick fronded
vegetation

  the atmosphere of a marked green tint
supported great fleecy clouds glowing in the
lurid sunlight in all shades of orange gold
red and yellow

  holderlin let the perseus fall toward the
base of a great black peak where dense for-
ests indicated good concealment single-
handed he landed the ship with its steering
jets fused an epic in itself

  for two tense hours he crouched in the
lifeboat jockeying the nose of the perseus
back and forth as it settled on its landing
blasts through the green murk past the hot-
colored clouds

  he had led two cords into the lifeboat with
him-one made fast to the throttle that he
might blast the ship to safety if the terrain
were too soft or too rough the other to kill
the tubes when the ship finally settled
solidly

  the perseus teetered low through the
green air and crashed down through the
black forests onto solid soil hplderlin
yanked his cut-off cord and the roaring
blasts died he fell limply back in his bucket
seat

  he stirred himself the green of the at-
mosphere hinted unhealthiness-and once
more climbing into his air-suit he returned
to the perseus

  he twisted the dial at the radio there was
only silence through the skyport he saw
that the soft black fronds had closed over
the ship the perseus was well concealed
holderlin slept

  when he awoke all was as before the radio
still silent he tested the atmosphere with the
bramley airolyzer and as he suspected the
dials showed poison but apparently there
were no tissue-irritant gasses and there was
a sufficiency of oxygen

  so he charged a respirator with appropri-
ate filters and jumped out on the planet to
inspect the steering jets he sank to his
ankles in an impalpable black dust like soot
which every passing puff of air blew into
whirls of black smoke

  as he walked he stirred up clouds of this
dust which settled in his clothes and into his
boots holderlin cursed he could see that a
grimy period lay before him he plodded
around to the steering jets

  they were both better and worse than he
had expected the linings were split and
broken and fragments had wedged across
the throat of the tube the electron filaments
were destroyed but the backplates of telex
	startling stories

crystal were still whole

  the tubes themselves were sound neither
belled warped nor cracked and apparently
the field coils were not burnt out holderlin
surmised that a small charge of vanzitrol
had been exploded in each

  he could not recall seeing any spare linings
aboard but to make sure he ransacked the
ship-to no avail however the naval reg-
ulation lining oven and a supply of flux
was in its place as provided by article  of
the astronautic code a law from the early
days of space-flight when durable linings
were unknown

  then every ship carried dozens of spares
-yet often as not these would burn out or
split in the heat and pressure and the ship
would be forced to land on a convenient
planet and mold another supply now hol-
derlins concern was to find a bed of clean
clay

  the ground at his feet was covered by the
black dust perhaps if he dug he might find
clay

  as he stood by the jets holderlin heard a
heavy shuffling tread through the forest he
ran back to the entrance port knowing that
on strange planets prudence and agility are
better safeguards than a needle-beam and
steel armor

  the creature of the footsteps passed close
beside the ship a thin shambling being
fifteen feet high vaguely manlike with a
spiders gaunt construction the arms and
legs were skin and bone the skin was
greenish-black the face peculiarly long and
vacant

  it had a fierce shock of reddish hair at
the back of its head the eyes were bulging
milky orbs the ears were wide and ex-
tended it passed the perseus with hardly a
glance and showed neither awe nor interest

  hey cried holderlin jumping to the
ground come here

  the thing paused a moment to regard him
dully through the red light then slowly
shambled off in its original direction stirring
up black clouds of dust it disappeared
through the feathery black jungle

  holderlin returned to the problem of re-
pairing the tubes he must find clay enough
to mold four new linings-three or four
hundred pounds he brought a spade from
the ship and dug into the surface

 he worked half an hour and turned up
nothing but hot black humus and the
deeper he dug the thicker and tougher grew
the roots of the fungus trees he gave up
in disgust

ak s he climbed sweating and dusty from
his hole a little breeze raced along the
top of the jungle stirring the fronds and in
the black fog which floated down holderlin

discovered the origin of the black powder at
his feet-spawn

  he must find clay clean yellow clay the
nearer the better he did not fancy carrying
this clay on his shoulder any great distance
he looked to where the lifeboat dangled by
its nose from the bow of the perseus

  he saw that the shackle with the entire
weight of the lifeboat hanging on it was
locked holderlin scratched ms head he
would have to balance the boat on the gravity
units releasing the shackle from all strain
to remove it

  but when he finally poised the boat in
mid-air and climbed out on the nose he
discovered that his shift of position had
weighted the bow and that if he unscrewed
the shackle the boat very likely would nose
down and throw him to the ground

  cursing both shackle and lifeboat holder-
lin let the boat hang against the hull as be-
fore and made his way to the ground he
entered the ship and outfitted himself with
a sack a light spade a canteen of water and
spare charges for his respirator

  aboard the perseus aboard the perseus
respond perseus

  holderlin chuckled grimly and sat down
beside the speaker

  aboard the perseus came the call again
this is captain creed speaking if you are
alive and listening respond immediately
you have bested us fair and square and we
hold no grudge but no matter how you
reached this planet you cannot go farther

  a detector screen surrounds you and
we will heterodyne any distress call you
broadcast

  evidently captain creed had not yet sur-
mised who had run off with his ship or how
it had been accomplished another voice
broke in harder and sharper

 respond immediately said the new
voice giving your position and you will
receive a share in the venture if you do
not we shall know how to act when we find
you and we will find you if it means search-
ing the planet foot by foot

 all during this pronouncement the
strength of the radio carrier wave had in-
creased rapidly and now holderlin heard
a low mutter rapidly waxing to a roar
running to the port he spied the black
pirate ship sweeping toward him across the
green sky just under the canopy of many-
colored clouds

  almost overhead the brake-blasts spewed
forward and the ship slowed in its majestic
course trapped-thought holderlin with
racing pulse he leapt for the lifeboat the
shackle hed blast away with his needle-
beam

 but the black ship passed across the
mountain where it slowly sank from sight
planet of the black dus	

sunlight glinting from its sides holderlin
breathed easily again this world was small
and the mountain made a prominent land-
mark probably the same reasons that had
brought him here to hide led them here to
seek him

 at least he knew where his enemies were
stationed a matter of some advantage how
to escape them he as yet had no notion
they seemed invulnerable with a fast well-
armed ship against his wrecked hulk and
certainly no less than thirty or forty in the
crew

 holderlin shrugged first he must repair
the tubes then he would try his luck at
winning clear and if he could bring that
scented cargo only as far as laroknik on
gavnad the sixth of delta aquila the uni-
verse lay open to him

  hed buy a space-yacht a villa on fan the
pleasure planet hed buy an asteroid and
create a world to his whim as did the em-
pires millionaires

  holderlin put aside his dreaming he took
his sack and plodded off through the black
dust in the direction of the mountain seeking
clay a half mile from the ship the feathery
black canopy overhead thinned and he en-
tered a clearing

  within this clearing moved a score of the
tall manlike creatures but their hair was
not reddish like that of the creature that had

 assed him in the wood it was greenish

 lack they stood busy with an enormous
beast evidently domesticated

 this had a great round body as big as a
house supported on a circle of wide arching
legs with two long tentacles it stuffed the
black tree-fronds into a maw on top of its
hulk below hung a number of teats at which
the black things worked squirting a thin
green liquid into pots

ut olderlin passed through the clearing

	full in the red sunglow but beyond a
few dull glances they took no heed of him
continuing a mile or so he came to the edge
of the forest and the steep rises of the moun-
tains

  almost at his feet he found what he sought
in the diminished gravity he loaded into his
sack a great deal more than he might have
carried on earth-perhaps a half of his needs
-and set out in return

 but as he waded through the black dust
the sack grew heavy and by the time he
reached the clearing where the natives tend-
ed their beast his arms and his back ached

  he stood resting watching the placid na-
tives at their work it occurred that possibly
one of them might be induced to serve him

 hey-you he called to the nearest as
best he could through the respirator come
here

  this one looked at holderlin without in-
terest

  come here he called again although
plainly the creature could not understand
him i need some help ill give you- he
fumbled in his pockets and pulled out a small
signal mirror-this

  he displayed it and presently the native
shambled across the glade to him it stooped
to take the mirror and a hint of interest
came over the long doleful face

  now take this said holderlin giving
over the sack of clay and follow me

  at last the creature understood what was
required of him and with no show of either
zeal or reluctance took the bag in its rickety
arms and shuffled along behind holderlin to
the ship when they arrived holderlin went
within and brought out a length of shiny
chain and showed it to his helper

  one more trip understand one more
trip lets go the creature obediently fol-
lowed him

  holderlin dug the clay loaded the bag into
the natives arms

  above them came the sound of voices
footsteps scuffling and grating on the rock
holderlin crept for cover the native stood
stupidly holding the sack of clay

  three figures came into sight two of them
panting through respirators-blaine and a
tall man whose pointed ears and high-arched
eyebrows proclaimed trankli blood the
third was a native with a red mop of hair

  whats this cried the trankli half-
breed spying holderlins helper that sack
is-

  they were the last words he spoke a
needle-beam chattered and cut him down
blaine whirled about grabbing for his own
weapon a voice brought him up short

  drop it blaine youre as good as dead

  blaine slowly dropped his hands to his
sides glaring madly in the direction of the
voice his malformed lip twitching holder-
lin stepped from the shadow into the scarlet
sunlight and his face was as ruthless as
death itself

  looking for me

  he walked over and took blaines needle-
beam he noted the natives reddish mop of
hair this was the one that had passed him in
the woods was evidently in league with his
enemies

  the needle-beam spoke once more and the
tall black body crumpled like broken jack-
straws holderlins worker watched im-
passively

  cant have any tale-bearers said hold-
erlin turning his ice-blue eyes on blaine

  why dont you give up holderlin
snarled blaine you cant get away alive

  do you think youll outlive me mocked
holderlin whats that youve got a ra-
	startling stories

dio hey ill take that he did so the
native was taking you to the perseus and
you were going to flash back the position
right

  thats right admitted blaine sourly
wondering at what moment he was to be
killed

  holderlin mused

  what ship are you in

 the maetho-killer donahues you
cant get away holderlin not with donahue
after you

  well see said holderlin shortly

  so it was killer donahues maetho hold-
erlin had heard tales of donahue-a slight
man of perhaps forty years with dark hair
and a pair of black eyes which saw around
corners and into mens minds he had a droll
clowns face but past deeds of blood and loot
did not echo the humor of his countenance

  holderlin thought a moment staring at the
flaccid blaine the native stood uninterest-
edly holding the clay

  well you wanted to see the perseus
holden said at last start moving he
gestured with the needle-beam

  blaine went slowly sullenly

 do you want to die now inquired
holderlin or are you going to do as i say
you got the gun growled blaine i got
no say at all

  good said holderlin then move fast-
er and tonight well cook linings for the
steering jets he motioned to the waiting
native with blaine ahead they plodded off
toward the ship

 whats over the mountain donahues
hideout holderlin asked

blaine nodded dourly then decided he
had nothing to lose by truckling to
holderlin

  he gets thame-dust here sells it on fan
  thame was an aphrodisiac powder

  the natives collect it bring it in little pots
he gives them salt for it they love salt
holderlin was silent saving his energy for
plowing the black dust

 suppose you did get away blaine
presently put forward you never could sell
those oils anywhere one whiff of sorang and
youd have the tellurian corps of investiga-
tion on your neck

  im not selling them said holderlin
think im a fool what do you think i got
that certification of shipwreck for im going
to claim salvage thats ninety per cent of
the value of ship and cargo by law

  blaine was silent

  when at last they arrived weary and be-
gsimed with black dust the native dropped
the sack and held out a gangling arm

  fawp fawp it said

  holderlin looked at him in puzzlement

  it wants salt said blaine still intent on
ingratiating holderlin they do anything for
salt

  is that so said holderlin well well
go in the galley and find some salt

  so holderlin gave the native the bit of
chain and a handful of salt and dismissed it
he turned back to blaine and gave him the
radio

  call up creed or donahue and tell them
that the native says you wont reach the ship
till tomorrow night-its that far off

  blaine hesitated only an instant long
enough for holderlin to lay a significant hand
on his needle-beam he did as was told he
called creed and creed seemed satisfied with
the information

  tell him you wont call again till to-
morrow night said holderlin say thats
because holderlin might catch an echo of the
beam from the mountain

  blaine did so

  good said holderlin blaine were go-
ing to get along very well maybe i wont
even kill you when im done with you

  blaine swallowed nervously he disliked
this kind of talk holderlin stretched his
arms

  now well make make tube linings and
because you ruined the last set youll do
most of the work

  all night they baked linings in the atomic
furnaces blaine as holderlin had promised
working the hardest his bald head glis-
tened in the glow from the furnace

  as soon as the linings were finished-no
longer clay but heavy metallic tubes-
holderlin clamped them in place and when
the angry little sun came over the horizon
the perseus was once more in condition to
navigate

  with blaines help holderlin unshackled
the lifeboat from the hull and brought it to
the ground beside the perseus then holder-
lin locked blaine in a storage locker

  youre lucky he observed you can
sleep i have to work holderlin had seen a
ten-pound can of vanzitrol in the perseus
armory-a compound stable chemically but
uncertain atomically holderlin ladled about
a pound into a paper sack enough to blast
the perseus clear through the planet

  he found a detonator and entering the life-
boat took off feeling safe from observation
after blaines information he skimmed low
over the black jungle until about thirty miles
from the perseus he found a clearing which
suited him not too large not too small

  he landed and buried the vanzitrol and the
detonator in the center then he returned to
the perseus and slept for four or five hours

  when he awoke he aroused blaine they
got in the lifeboat flew to the mined clear-
ing holderlin set the lifeboat down two
planet of the black dust	

hundred yards out in the jungle

  now blaine he said youre to call
creed and tell him youve found the perseus
tell him to take a bearing on the radio beam
and come at once tell him theres a clearing
handy for him to land in

  then what asked blaine doubtfully

  then youll wait in the clearing until the
maetho is about to land after that ill give
you a cioice if you want to return aboard
the maetho you can stay where you are if
you want to stay with me youll run like mad
for the lifeboat suit yourself

  blaine did not answer but a suspicious
look crept into his eyes and his lips curled
craftily

  send the message said holderlin

  blaine did so and holderlin was satisfied
they had cornered holderlin in the perseus
said blaine and mordang the trankli half-
breed was holding him while blaine radioed

  very good blaine came back creeds
voice then donahue asked a few sharp
questions had the perseus crashed no re-
plied blaine she was sound could the per-
seus bring her needle-beam to bear on the
clearing no the clearing was quite safe a
half mile astern of the perseus donahue or-
dered blaine to wait in the clearing for the
ship

  twenty minutes later holderlin hidden in
the jungle and blaine standing nervously in
the clearing saw the hulk of the maetho come
drifting overhead

it hovered about five hundred yards
above blaine nakedly caught in the red
sunlight waved an arm to the ship at holder-
lins brittle command

  there was a pause the cautious donahue
apparently was inspecting the situation

  presently holderlin waiting tensely at the
edge of the forest saw a small scout boat
leave the maetho drift down toward the
clearing his mouth tightened he cursed
once bitterly

  this meant either creed or donahue had
smelled a rat his plan could not succeed-
hed have to move fast to escape with his
skin blaine also knew the jig was up was
uncertain which way to jump

  he decided that under the circumstances
holderlin offered the least immediate danger
and casually began to leave the clearing at
once donahues voice crackled from a loud
speaker

  blaine stay where you are

  blaine broke into a frightened run but the
black dust hampered him from the maetho
a needle-beam spoke and amid a great puff
of black dust blaine exploded to his com-
ponent atoms

  holderlin was already to the lifeboat a
slim chance remained that the lifeboat on

landing would miss the mine and the maetho
would land and be blown to scrap but this
he doubted as the detonator was sensitive
he clearing small

  an air-rending blast as he entered his boat
assured him he was right the ground
swayed like jelly and a hail of earth rocks
bits of trees spattered far over the jungle
the maetho was tossed upward like a toy
balloon a tremendous choking pall of black
dust thickened the sky

  holderlin jerked his lifeboat into the air
and dashed away low to the ground through
the trees he drove for his life threading
the trees as best he might crashing through
those he could not dodge

  nor was he too early for all the maethos
armament had opened a savage fire on the
jungle blasting at each square yard twice
million-watt bolts missed him by feet

  after rocking minutes he gained clear of
the area and slowing his mad flight wove a
more careful course through the trees

  when the maetho was finally finished the
jungle lay torn into great craters and
tangled rubbish for miles around holderlin
gingerly raising the boat so he could peer
through the tree tops saw the great sullen
shape of the war-ship winging back across
the mountain to its base over the clearing
towered a black sky-filling cloud

  he returned to the perseus and sat brood-
ing in his quarters his bolt seemed to be
shot and it would only be a matter of hours
before creed and donahue found another
native to guide them to his ship

  he sprawled on his bunk hands behind his
head a nucleus of information blaine had
given him suddenly blossomed to a plan of
action he got up spooned some more van-
zitrol from the can gathered up a few sacks
of salt from the galley took off in the life-
boat

  three or four hours later with night fast
falling across the black forest he returned
and there was a spring in his walk a tri-
umphant set to his jaw

  holderlin went to the teleview and boldly
sent forth a call

  aboard the maetho creed or donahue
come in maetho come in hie screen
flickered to life at once there was donahue
and behind him the black bearded face of
captain creed

  well said donahue crisply what do
you want

  holderlin grinned nothing in about two
minutes im blasting your ship to bits if
you enjoy life youll get clear

  whats this donahues voice snapped
like breaking wood are you trying to
bluff me

  youll know in two minutes responded
holderlin three of the pots of thame-dust
	startling stories

you took aboard today are loaded with van-
zitrol ive got a gamma-ray detonator you
cant jam now youve two minutes to get
clear

  donahue whirled cut in the ships loud
speaker

  abandon ship all hands he shouted
get clear

  then like a cat he whirled about holder-
lin watched in interest captain creed was
striding for the door he met donahues eyes
and saw murder he stopped in his tracks
and slowly turned to face donahue

  donahue began talking and holderlin saw
he was not sane obscenities poured from his
lips

  you white-faced dog youve ruined me
screamed donahue in a high-pitched crazy
voice and his thin body was as tense as an
epileptics

  lets leave the ship and argue later
creed suggested coolly

  youll stay here you fat filth cried
donahue and whipped out his needle-beam

creed fired his sleeve gun and donahue fell
to the ground screaming his shoulder
mangled

  he picked up the needle-beam with his
left hand and began throwing wild shots at
creed creed crouched behind the radio
locker unable to gain the door a bolt
smashed the teleview feeder lines the
screen went dark

  holderlin sat looking at his watch he held
one hand poised over a little black key

  twenty seconds ten seconds eight seconds
seven six five four three two-ill give
them five seconds more he told himself
one-two-three-four-five he snapped
closed the key and sat like a statue waiting
for the shock from across the mountain

 whoom

  holderlin stood up a grin on his face he
sealed all the ports and sat himself at the
controls ahead of him lay a busy week
wherein he must do the work of four men
he cracked back the throttle and took off for
laroknik on gavnad

	startling stories

there was something wrong when from the
age of fifteen i often found myself mysteri-
ously a few hours ahead of the right time
without knowing how i had done it i should
also have attached suspicion to repeating ac-
tions i had done before but then all of us
have felt that we have done such-and-such
a thing before and so like you i didnt think
any more about it

  until the impossible happened

  i had just left the office at  pm i was
then clerk to a big firm of lawyers in the
usual way i took the elevator to the street
level and went outside the october evening
was darkening to twilight and the lights of
new york were on either side of me as
usual climbing into drear muggy sky

  i remember singing to myself as i swung
along another day over betty to meet and
a cheery evening ahead of both of us   but
i did not keep that appointment because
you see i walked into something which was
at once beyond all sane imagining

  one moment i was streaking for the bus
stop-then the next i was in the midst of a
completely formless gray abyss it had neither
up nor down light nor dark form nor out-
line i was running on something solid and
yet i couldnt see it and it was just when i
was trying to imagine the reason for this sud-
den fog that i found myself still running
down a broad highway i had never in my life
seen before

  i slowed to a standstill and cuffed my hat
up on my forehead as i looked about me
the street had altered inexplicably it was
not gray and dirty but highly glazed as
though the road surface were made of pol-
ished black glass the traffic too was strange-
ly designed and almost silent there were no
gasoline fumes-i noticed this particularly
in general the buildings were much the same
only shiny on the facades and somewhat
taller

  and the lighting it was still night but in-
stead of the usual street illumination there
were great elliptical globes swinging in mid-
air somehow and casting a brilliance below
that had no shadows everything had the
pallid brightness of diffused daylight

  anything the matter a pleasant voice
asked me

i turned sharply as a passer-by paused
until now i hadnt noticed that the men
and women passing up and down the side-
walk were rather odd in their attire-the

women in particular the absurd hats the
queer translucent look of their clothes the
multicolored paints to enhance their features
still women-eternally feminine-but differ-
ent and now this stranger he was tall and
young with pleasant eyes and the most amaz-
ingly designed soft hat

  i noticed you hesitating he explained
passing a curious but well mannered eye over
my attire can i help you

  it surprised me to find anybody so cour-
teous

  im just wondering-where i am i re-
plied haltingly this is new york isnt it
yes indeed

  wall street

  his look of surprise deepened why no
he said youre on twenty-seven street
dont you remember that all street names
were abolished ten years ago to avoid dupli-
cation

  i could only gaze at him fixedly and he
gave a slight smile

  look here youre mixed up somewhere
he said taking my arm its a part of the
citys lend a hand policy for us to help each
other so im going to make you my especial
charge incidentally the lend a hand policy
is a good idea dont you think he asked
forcing me to stroll along with him its
done away with a lot of the old backbiting
oh surely i agreed weakly but look
here-er-what sort of cars are those
theyre very quiet

 you mean the atom-cars say where
have you lived and if youll forgive me
thats an awfully old fashioned coat youve
got on i know its a breach of courtesy but
im curious

  i dragged to a stop and faced him directly
you wont credit this i said but only
what seems about ten minutes ago i was
running down wall street for an ordinary
gasoline-driven bus then i ran into a fog
or something and-suddenly i was here

  it would be ill mannered for me to dis-
believe he said slowly regarding me yet
i am puzzled it may help you if i explain
that you are in new york city which was re-
surfaced with plastic in nineteen fifty-eight
the present date is october the twelfth nine-
teen seventy-one

 twenty-five years great goeffrey
somehow i had slipped a quarter of a cen-
tury ahead of my own time of  you can
think of such things but you dare not believe
them yet hang it it had happened
the vicious circle	

  i had no opportunity to ask my genial
friend anything more for he was blending
into the returning gray mist and i was back
again in that blank world where nothing is
or ever was that world which is outside time
space and understanding i stood wondering
and fearful waiting

  this time i sensed that the interval was
longer but when the mist evaporated it re-
vealed that i was back again in familiar wall
street only i had moved some two hundred
yards from the bus stop-or in other words-
the precise distance i had walked with the
stranger

  i blinked mopped my perspiring face then
glanced up at a nearby clock it was 
the exact time as when i had started to run
for the bus i had left the office at -five
minutes to get down the street  

  had my other adventure taken up no time
whatever

  by an effort i pulled myself together when
i saw one or two passers-by looking at me
curiously i had to think this one out-maybe
talk it over with betty hargreaves since ap-
parently i still had time to meet her

  but she never arrived to keep the appoint-
ment finally i rang up her apartment it
was only after the storm with her had sub-
sided that i realized i had arrived back in
the same place on the following evening-
twenty-four hours later

  i smoothed things over with her as best i
could said i had been sent out of town on
urgent business and we promised to meet at
the same time and place the following eve-
ning i didnt add i hope even if i felt
like it

  troubled i began a contemplative wander-
ing through the city heading in the general
direction of my rooming house

  i never reached it to my alarm i once
more found myself sailing into grayness and
there was nothing i could do to avoid it my
last vision was of a distant lighted clock
point to  then it was gone and i was
helpless baffled frightened

amid this gray enigma all sense of direc-
tion time and space vanish i found it
safest to stand still and wait until it cleared
it did so eventually and i discovered i was
lying in bed in a quiet little room with a gray
oblong of window revealing the night sky

  puzzled i stirred restlessly and reached
out a hand for the bedside lamp when i
scrambled out of bed and looked down at my-

self i got an even bigger shock

  i had the figure of a boy of seven years i
was just as i had looked at seven

  with a kind of automatic instinct i went to
the dressing table and stared at myself in the
mirror there was no doubt about it-i was
a child once more in my own little bedroom
at home in washington my parents must be
asleep in the next room but somehow i didnt
dare go and look yet i had the memory of
everything i had done up to the age of thirty-
two

  impossible idiotic i had grown back-
wards

  returning to the bed i threw myself upon
it and struggled to sort the puzzle out but
gradually that impalpable mist came creep-
ing back and i left the world of my childhood
wandered for a while in blank unknown and
then emerged into the street from which i
had disappeared  

  the first thing i saw was that lighted clock
ahead it was still at  presumably i had
once again been absent exactly twenty-four
hours-and i had traveled twenty-five years
backwards even as on the other occasion i
had traveled twenty-five years forwards

  can you wonder that i was sick at heart
perplexed it appeared then that my inter-
vals in normal time lasted about five hours
-or to be exact  hours  minutes queer
how i cold-bloodedly weighed this up i felt
like a visitor who has only five hours to stay
in a town before going on his way

  when i encountered a police officer pres-
ently i asked him what day it was and his
rather suspicious answer confirmed my theo-
ry of a twenty-four hour absence i got away
from him before he ran me in and went
straight to betty hargreaves apartment for-
tunately she had not yet gone to bed and she
eyed me with chilly disfavor when we were in
the lounge

  i suppose i cooled my heels because you
had urgent business again she asked going
over to the sideboard and mixing me a drink
ive got a telephone you know you could
have told me

  im sorry about that appointment bet i
just couldnt keep it i-er- i hesitated
over the right phrasing-i sort of keep com-
ing and going

  youre telling me

  she handed me my drink and raised a finely
lined eyebrow betty is a pretty girl a slim
blond with eyes which are really blue and
hair which is really golden but when she
startling stories



looks annoyed-whew

  i never heard of a financiers chief clerk
coming and going as much as you do she
commented presently sitting down on the
divan beside me whats happening dick
is there a merger on or what

  no its-er- i put the drink down and
caught at her arm bet i need help im
in one gosh-awful spot

  money or a girl she questioned drily
if its money i can help you out dad didnt
exactly leave me penniless if its a girl then
lets say good night and thanks for the memo-
ry

  no its neither i said its so hard to
explain you see i-i keep seeing the future
and the past

  be it said to her everlasting credit that she
did not even blink she just gazed as one
might at a lunatic a baby or a dipsomaniac
and while she gazed i talked the words tum-
bling over themselves i told her everything
and when i had finished i expected her to
laugh in my face only she didnt instead
she was thoughtful

  its mighty odd she said seriously and
because i know you havent a scrap of imag-
ination and are too gosh-darned honest to
lie for no reason i believe you but its
creepy she hugged herself momentarily
and what are we going to do about it
we bless the girl she was on my side
i dunno i muttered so far as i can
estimate i am allowed five hours to live like
an ordinary man then off i go i dont know
if a doctor could explain it or maybe a psy-
chiatrist

  hardly a doctor dick she shook her
fair head musingly it isnt as though youve
got a pain its more like an illusion you
might do worse than see dr pembroke hes
a psychiatrist in the hammersley trust
building i know because a cousin of mine
went to him for treatment

  i made up my mind ill see him at the
first opportunity it wont be in the morning
because i expect ill be veered off again at
about four-fifteen in the small hours when
i can catch up on normal working hours ill
see what he can do for me

fr ridiculous conversation this probably
hit an all time high yet so sure was i of
the things which had happened to me and so
staunch was bettys loyalty we might have
been talking of the next gridiron match any-
way she was a great comfort to me and when

i left her around  it was with the re-
solve to master my trouble when it came
upon me again

  i went home to my rooms learned from a
note under the door that my firm had tele-
phoned to inquire what had happened to me
and then i went to bed funny but i wasnt
tired in spite of everything and i must have
gone to sleep quite normally

  but when i awoke again i was not in my
bedroom though i was in pajamas

  it took me several minutes to get the hang
of an entirely new situation i was lying on
my back on closely cropped and very green
grass the air was chilly but not unpleasant-
ly so the sky overhead was misty blue with
the sun just rising i judged it was still oc-
tober but extremely mild

  as i stood up i got a shock a small group
of men and women-attired so identically it
was only by their figures i could tell any dif-
ference in sex-was watching me embar-
rassed i stared back at them across a few
yards of soft grass then i was astonished to
behold the foremost man and woman sudden-
ly float over to me with arms outstretched on
either side they settled beside me they had
silver-colored wings folded flat on their
backs

  i know i sighed as they appraised me
ive no right to be here and im in the future
all right lock me up it wont make any
difference

 the man and woman exchanged glances
and i had the time to notice that they were
both remarkable specimens-tall strong ath-
letic-looking with queer motors strapped to
their waist belts from which wires led to the
wings on their backs

  after a good deal of crosstalk i found out
that they belonged to the local police force
made up of an equal number erf men and
women and that i was of course both a tres-
passer and an amazing specimen to boot
this time it appeared i had slipped ahead
not twenty five years but two hundred

  were i a literary man i suppose i could
fill a book with the marvels i discovered but
here it is wisest policy to sketch in the prin-
cipal advancements i learned that their
amazing system of individual flight had led to
the abolition of ordinary aircraft that they
had conquered space mastered telepathy
overcome the vagaries of the climate and
completely outlawed war yes it was a fair
and prosperous land i saw in 

  in the end they locked me up for examina-
the vicious circle	

tion by their scientists but of course it did
them no good for as time passed i faded away
from the prison cell and was back again in
new yorlc still in my pajamas in the middle
of a street and-i soon discovered-at 
in the morning once again twenty-four
hours had elapsed since presumably i had
vanished while asleep at  twenty-four
hours before

  to be thus thinly clad on an october early
morning is no picnic i took the only sen-
sible course and presented myself at a police
station told the sergeant in charge that i had
been sleep-walking and had just awakened
i was believed and i got shelter after bor-
rowing a suit of clothes i crept home to my
rooms in the early dawn hours

  now i really was getting frightened if this
were to go on-good heavens i did some
computing and figured that i had until about
 in the morning before id take another
trip so before that time i must see dr pem-
broke it was unlikely that he would be at
his office so early unless the urgency of the
reason were stressed

  i rang up betty told her what had oc-
curred and asked her advice she suggested
that i tell pembroke over the phone at his
home what had happened and try to get him
to be at his office before nine she promised
to be there also

  dr pembroke did not sound at all enthusi-
astic at first but he warmed up a trifle when
i went into explicit details finally he seemed
interested enough to agree to be at his con-
sulting rooms by  so it was arranged

  promptly at quarter to nine i was there
with betty very serious and determined be-
side me

  grant pembroke was at his office promptly
on time he was a tall eagle-nosed man with
very sharp gray eyes and a tautly profession-
al manner he ushered us both into his con-
sulting room which was equipped with rather
overpowering looking apparatus and then
switched on softly shaded fights and mo-
tioned me to be seated in their immediate
focus betty sat in the margin of the shad-
ows

  so mr mills you keep imagining you
float away into the future and the past at
regular intervals eh he asked slowly set-
tling down and fixing me with those piercing
eyes

his scepticism caused me to grow even
more earnest

  i dont imagine it doc-it actually hap-
pens i told him and in about fifteen min-
utes it should happen again then youll see
for yourself

  mmmm he made a brief examination
of me as though he were a medical man then
sat back in his chair again and put his finger-
tips together and while you are away
twenty-four elapse here he asked the
question thoughtfully

  thats correct yes

  do twenty-four hours elapse in the place
you-er-visit

  no it varies a lot the only definite tim-
ing ive noticed is that on the last occasion i
leaped two hundred years ahead instead of
the former twenty-five

  just so just so a most interesting side-
light on time

  i dont want to be an interesting side-
light i protested fiercely i want to live
like any other man marry the girl i love
and keep my job as things are i am in dan-
ger of losing them all this sort of thing is
unthinkable

  mmm just so he agreed but there is
the other side you know we are dealing
with a paradox of time that has so far only
been a theory and never proved you may
have the good fortune to be that living
proof

  i could only assume that he had queer
ideas on what constitutes good fortune and
so i kept quiet for another long minute he
studied me then turning to his desk he began
to scribble something down on a scratch pad
he also made calculations and a drawing that
looked like a plus sign with a circle running
through it i was just about to ask him the
purpose of this doodling when things hap-
pened-once again

even as i felt myself drifting into gray
mist i noticed the electric clock stood at ex-
actly  that betty and pembroke had
jumped to their feet in stunned amazement
then off i went and this movement was

backwards in time not forward----

  when the mists cleared i was seated on a
wagon driving a horse in a leisurely manner
along a winding country road i saw i was
wearing rough breeches and a flannel shirt
while a hot sun was blazing down on my bat-
tered straw hat a yokel a farmer a pio-
neer i had never been any of these things
so far as i could remember-yet here it was

  glancing inside the wagon i saw a woman
and a boy and girl asleep and far behind my
	startling stories

wagon were many more of similar design
kicking up a haze of dust across the desert

  i had to work discreetly to find out what
was going on and very astonished i was to
discover that my name was joseph kendal
and that the three in the wagon were my wife
and two children we were heading for geor-
gia which had been settled by general ogle-
thorpe a few years previously in other words
the general had fixed georgia as he wanted it
in  and this-according to my wife-was
 we were changing our domicile every
one of us but all that this signified to me
was that i had dropped back two hundred
years even as before i had gone ahead for a
similar period

  i scarcely remember what happened while
i was there it seemed to be one endless trip
across the desert with all the old pioneering
flavor about it i fitted into it without any
effort everything i did seemed reasonable
and natural secretly i was rather sorry
when it all had to come to an end just after
sunset and i was in the gray mists of be-
tween beyond or whatever it is   

  i returned to normality seated in that same
chair in dr pembrokes consulting room he
was opposite me looking very weary and un-
tidy betty who had apparently been half
asleep in the chair on the rim of the shadows
jerked into life as i sat gazing at her i
glanced round and noticed two white-coated
nurses and two men who looked like scien-
tists

  my eyes moved to the clock it registered
 and judging from the window it was
daylight

  twenty-four hours to the minute pem-
broke ejaculated getting up and coming over
to me upon my soul young man you
didnt exaggerate weve been waiting and
waiting ever since you disappeared from
view i summoned the nurses in case of need
and these two gentlemen here are scientists
with whom ive been discussing your prob-
lem

  the point is have you got the answer
i asked irritably

  yes yes indeed pembroke assented
and the two scientists nodded their heads in
grave confirmation but he added it is
rather a grim answer

  i dont mind that i said can i be
cured

they were silent i set my jaw and
glanced helplessly at betty she could

only stare back at me tired from the long
vigil and i thought i saw tears in her eyes
as though she were trying to control an inner
grief at last i looked back at pembroke

  tell me what you have done and where
you have been he instructed

  i did so well lets have it i finished
bitterly what is wrong with me

  he hesitated then going over to his desk
he handed me a sheet of paper on which was
a curious looking drawing the finished effort
which i had seen him commence just before
i had evaporated the drawing looked like
a plus sign

  the horizontal line was marked past at
the left hand end and future at the right

now line

pr pembroke rough sketch

hand end where the vertical line intercepted
it in the center was the word now this
same now was also inscribed at top and
bottom of the vertical line so far so good
now came the odd bit

  starting from the exact center of the plus
sign was an ever widening curve just like
the jam line inside a swiss roll you know
how that line circles out wider and wider
well that is what it looked like and of course
it inevitably crossed the right hand section of
the horizontal line marked future and the
left hand line marked past

  so i sat staring at this drawing which
looked as though it had come out of alice in
wonderland as pembroke started speaking

  young man i dont want to be blunt but
i have to he said you-are a freak of na-
ture every human being every animal
every thing is following a time line through
space and that line is straight you may re-
call sir james jeans observations on this in
his mysterious universe 

  i shook my head i never read jeans
  mmm too bad then let me quote the
the vicious circle	

relevant statement on page one forty-two
from the penguin edition pembroke picked
up the blue covered book he says-your
body moves along the time line like a bicy-
cle wheel and because of this your conscious-
ness touches the world only at one place at
one time just as only part of the cycle wheel
touches the road at one time it may be that
time is spread out in a straight line but we
only contact one instant of it as we progress
from past to future   in fact as weyl has
said-events do not happen we merely
come across them  end quote

  and what has this to do with me  de-
manded

  just this pembroke returned the book
to his desk your time line is not straight
it operates in a circle like that circular de-
sign you see there you told me that in ear-
lier life you noticed you were unaccountably
late sometimes and unusually early at
others

  ye-es i agreed thinking thats right
enough

  that pembroke mused can be taken as
evidence of the first aberrations in the time
line you were following now it has taken
its first real curve instead of progressing
normally in a straight line you are carried
into hyperspace-that gray mist you have
mentioned-which is non-dimensional non-
solid non-etheric in a word its plain
vacuum-

  but i lived and breathed i interrupted
him

  are you sure he asked quietly

  i hesitated now that i came to think back
i wasnt

  you can no more be sure you lived and
breathed than you can be sure of what you
do under anaesthetic he said but you were
still heading along a time line-not of your
own volition mind you-but inevitably be-
cause time sweeps us along with it and so
when the curve struck the normal straight
time line leading from past to future-the
world line that is which earth herself is
following-you became a part of it again but
you were twenty-five years ahead of the
present

  i nodded slowly so far he made sense

  you stayed there for a period of which
you are uncertain chiefly because your sense
of time had become catastrophically upset
and then still impelled along this circular
time line you came back through hyper-
space and once more intersected the normal

now line exactly twenty-four hours after-
wards events then proceeded normally for a
while until-still following the circle-you
passed through hyperspace to a past event
then hyperspace intervened once more and
so you came back to now

  then as the circles grow larger from the
center the gaps will become correspondingly
greater i questioned and my voice sounded
as though it did not belong to me

dr pembroke gave me a sympathetic
glance and nodded

  just so and the mathematical accuracy of
first twenty-five and then two hundred
years-forward and backward-shows that
the problem is not a disorder but a mathe-
matical fluke quite beyond human power to
alter you move in a circle mr mills not a
straight line and unless at some point the
circle turns back on itself-an unlikely pos-
sibility since the universe is a perfect cyclic
scheme-i can foresee nothing else but   
endless circular traveling gradually taking
in vast segments of time until  

 pembroke stopped and the room seemed
deathly quiet for some reason though i was
calm now the thing was explained

 can you account for my not feeling
tired i asked presently

  certainly you somewhat resemble a bat-
tery you use up energy in a forward move-
ment into time because you are in essence
moving into the unexplored-but in the back-
ward movement the energy replaces itself
because you are merely returning to a state
already lived you cannot grow old or tired
or suffer from catabolism in the ordinary
way because you represent a perfect balance
between catabolism and anabolism the exact
amount of each being equal because each
journey is the same amount of time-name-
ly first twenty-five then two hundred and
next-well who knows

  look here i said slowly this last time
i went back two hundred years as i told you
but i was somebody else-a pioneer or some-
thing of two centuries ago i was never that
in a past life you must have been he an-
swered calmly otherwise you could not
have taken over that identity

  then when i was that person why didnt
i know what lay in the future

  perhaps you did can you be sure that
you didnt

  this was becoming involved all right but
	startling stories

after all i wasnt sure no darn it i couldnt
answer it maybe i had known

  and when i was a boy of seven i asked
i presume i became a boy again because i
was just at that age

  just so time-instants are indestructible
you are bound to become at a certain instant
what you are at that instant otherwise time
itself would become a misnomer you will
ask why-at seven years of age-you did not
know what you would do at thirty-two
again i say are you sure you didnt

  i-i dont know i dont think so-unless
it was buried in my subconscious or some-
thing

  it must have been it was there that
knowledge but maybe you considered it as
just a dream fancy and thought no more
about it just as we speculate on how we may
look in say ten years time and then dismiss
it as pure imagination but with you such
an imagining would be fact and incidentally
as for your carrying a memory of these pres-
ent experiences about with you remember
that your physical self is all that is affected
by time mind and memory cannot alter
and-what happens now i simply
dragged the words out

  for your sake young man i hope things
will straighten out for you but if they dont
i have a proposition tell rrz have you any
relatives

  none living no i was intending to marry
miss hargreaves here very soon

  mmmrti just so well the institute of sci-
ence is prepared to subsidize a trust by
which anybody you may name can benefit in
return we ask that in your swing back to the
now line you will give us every detail of
what has been happening to you during your
absences

  i shook my head bewilderedly ill-ill
do it willingly but i dont want the money
and bet-miss hargreaves-has plenty of
money anyway doc isnt there some way to
remedy all this i asked desperately i can
tell from your making this proposition that
you consider it serious

  im sorry mr mills i really am but no
human agency can come to grips with your
problem

  i was silent through a long interval betty
seated now at my side i looked at her hope-
lessly

bet sweetheart what do you say do you
know anybody who needs money in trust
no she answered bitterly money is

the cheapest most earthy compensation sci-
ence can offer you for a ruined life i dont
want any part of it oh dick there must
be some way out of this

  i shook my head there wasnt i knew it
now   finally i told pembroke that the
money had better be handed over to scien-
tific research and on my all too infrequent
returns to now i would tell everything i
knew

  we could marry i whispered to betty
only it wouldnt be fair to you a day might
come when id never return

pembroke confirmed this quietly it
will he said when your circular line
takes so wide an orbit that it passes beyond
the ends of the now line into hyperspace
youll vanish forever

  then i was doomed indeed all i could
hope for was an occasional glimpse of betty
as for the rest i didnt know----

  my five-hour stay was taken up in signing
legal documents then once more i was swept
inevitably into hyperspace so i went through
the gray enigma which baffles description
and this time i was six hundred years ahead
of the now line there was still progress
the building of superb cities the conquest of
other worlds a sense of greater equality and
comradeship between both sexes  

  so back to now for a brief spell with a tear-
ful betty a long description of my experi-
ences to the scientists a banquet in my honor
at the science institute-then outwards and
backwards into the past for a gap of another
six hundred years

  back and forth as the circle widened   

  i have tried to keep out of this narrative
the inner horror i experienced at it all-the
dull dead futility of being flung by nameless
force into an ever widening gulf each time
of course as the circle widened i went further
afield

  hundreds of years thousands of years
from one end of the pendulums swing to the
other-backwards into scores of lives which
had long since been effaced from memory
forwards into a wonder world of ever in-
creasing splendor

  then in the tens of thousands of years
ahead i saw man was pretty close to leaving
his material form altogether and becoming
purely mental so much so that on my visit
after this one earth was empty and turning
one face to the sun age old and remorseless
was crawling over a once busy planet
the vicious circle



  at the opposite end of the scale life was
swinging down into the neanderthal man
stage and then further back still to where
man was not even present

  but there were amoeba the first forms of
life and i fancy that i must have been one
of these

  backwards-forwards-with the visions of
now mere shadows in a universe which was
to me insane nothing made sense any more
i was losing touch with every well remem-
bered thing with the dear girl who always
awaited my comings and goings-growing
older but always loyal and around her the
cold impersonal scientists logging down in-
formation that could chart the course of civil-
izations for ages to come no wonder i had
seen progress ahead my own guidance had
prevented any mistakes and in those distant
visions i had seen the fruit of my own advice
incredible-yet true

  gradually i realized that my time circle
was now becoming so huge that it was involv-
ing a stupendous orbit which did not include
earth but the universe as a whole proving
how independent of normal time lines had
my vicious circle become

  in my swing i saw the birth of the earth
and the gradual slowing down of the uni-

verse this i think is destined to be my last
return to the now line for the next curve
will be so enormous that-well i do not think
i shall be able to make contact with the now
line at all the scientists have charted it all
out for me

  the curve will take me to the period of the
initial explosion which created the expanding
universe out of-what that will be in the
past and my futureward movement will car-
ry me to that state of sublime peace where
all the possible interchanges of energy have
been made where there exists thermody-
namical equilibrium and the death of all that
is at either end of the curve time is non-
existent this is where i may at last find rest

  as i think on these things writing these
last words in the world of now i cannot help
but marvel at what i have done but i hate
it i hate it with all my human soul oppo-
site to me in this bright room betty is seated
silent dry-eyed faithful to the last science
is still represented in the quiet men in the
chairs by the far wall all of them busy writ-
ing and checking notes

  never was so strange a sentence passed
on a human being

  the grayness is coming i have no time to
write any more

president woodward and his cabinet wage a unique war on
the six evil men who have made a duplicate of the world

arthur woodward youngest
protectorate president ever to hold
office in the world government had
a dream that night in the dream he was
yanked out of bed and before him stood six
of the ugliest most repulsive old men he had
ever seen

  arthur woodward one of the old men
snapped be informed that we are not
pleased with you and yours



  arthur woodward carefully sat on the
edge of his bed grinning what a dream
but he would hear the dream out even take
part in it-and be properly amused

  tell me more he begged

  they told him snarling thte words it ap-
peared that they were living entities who
had come out of interstellar space they
had merely taken the appearance of old men
for their purposes-their purpose being to
extra earth	

judge the peoples of earth were earth peo-
ple kind were they humble were they
decent to their fellow man to discover the
answers to these questions the six old men
who in their natural habitat were but elec-
tronic swirls which could move through
space with the speed of light had stationed
themselves on various busy street corners
throughout the earth they had danced on
their old legs they had sung in their cracked
voices and they held out their hats to pass-
ersby begging for alms but people had
merely looked at them amusedly and gone
on

  a curse be on you selfish earthlings
raved one old man

  your conceit is overbearing said a
second

  oh it was a strange dream all around

  arthur woodward laughed

  old men youre a bunch of bored mis-
chievous rascals he said sternly after
years of wandering through space you want
some excitement so you picked out the one
way of judging earth that wont work why
well because we dont have poverty we
dont have beggars to the people who re-
fused to give you alms you were eccentrics
having fun and that you were seriously ask-
ing for money never entered their heads

  they ringed him in a spitting angry circle
one shook his hand over his head

  this is our curse said he ignoring
woodwards accusation you love your-
selves too much therefore you and yours
shall be doubled that you may enjoy your-
selves twice as much

  then the six old men turned into their
normal electronic vapors and went wisping
out the window

  and arthur woodward yawned what a
dream he went back to bed he slept   

en route from mars to earth the
giant space-liner winko carrying a full
cargo of martian foodstuffs throbbed and
trembled down its length as it slipped
through the deeps of space

  in the chart room was an insane confusion

  earth is off our port bow sir

  impossible snapped captain anders
bursting into the room annoyed with an in-
credible example of incompetence he strode
to the televis plate he took one look at the
azure sun-lit planet and grabbed convul-
sively at the edge of the instrument board

  he turned rigidly to his first mate

 when were we supposed to dock at
earth

  at twenty-one oclock sir in fourteen
hours

  there was silence the voice of insanity
whispered lightly to each officer in the room
anders closed his eyes trying to think with
an effort he opened them drew himself
erect	

  men one of two remarkable things has
happened he said slowly either the planet
earth has jumped clear across space to a
new point in its orbit or we of this ship
have been under an anesthetic for the last
fourteen hours we will however cease all
speculation and prepare for the landing

  an hour later anders came down the
gangplank jn his trim white uniform he
looked around on the space-field the depot
and various administration buildings loomed
to the left the wooded forest to the right
and on the horizon could be seen the glow
of the distant city this was the field this
was the planet and coming toward him was
the space-field supervisor

  the man stopped within a few feet of an-
ders his face unnaturally tense

  is it-is it really you captain anders
he faltered

  who else anders was irritated whats
going on apparently im fourteen hours off
schedule 

  off schedule the other repeated shak-
ing violently captain anders you havent
even left the planet youre back before
you started he moaned please come
with me captain anders

  the supervisor took anders to the space-
field personnels restaurant here a crew was
gathered at a large table enjoying the cus-
tomary take-off meal

  it was captain anders crew

  and at the head of the table sat captain
anders

  the captain anders of the table and the
captain anders who had just entered the
restaurant saw each other at the same time
there was a raw seething silence as one
man the crew came to their feet staring

  anders one walked toward anders two
he knew he was looking at himself he didnt
know why but he did know this shockingly
he hated that other him as he had never
hated anything in his life yet he kept his
emotions and his voice under a supreme con-
trol

  we dont know what has happened he
	startling stories

remarked what ever it is this i know-
you and i must be friends he paused
what he had said sounded like nonsense-
that he should insist on friendship with-
himself

  do you agree he asked

  at that moment the annunciator on the
wall crackled

  all space services will stand by for a spe-
cial announcement

  this is arthur woodward protectorate
president of earth a deep resonant voice
spoke a moment later i make the follow-
ing declaration without explanation just a
few moments ago martian officials gave us
startling verified information the planet
earth has fallen behind two hundred thirty-
six million miles in its orbit further at the
point in space which our earth should oc-
cupy there is another planet of identical size
and with an identical satellite

  all space-flights are hereby canceled until
further notice

  the annunciator was silent captain an-
ders n rose from his place at the table and
advanced halfway to meet captain anders i

  i agree he said quietly

  he stuck out his hand toward that of an-
ders i

  neither of the duplicates was prepared for
what happened but to one of them it didnt
matter   

	   

  on the planet mars shortly after this dar
tal marto-tellurian trade relations media-
tor which important office gave him virtual
control of the planet kept that tremendous
calm for which he and his race were noted
he listened to the pronouncement of his chief
astronomer and languidly fondled the hem of
his gold robe

  i foresee trouble said dar tal we have
two planet earths swimming along in their
orbits at different points why this is so we
shall not conjecture at the present moment
it is sufficient that your telescopic observa-
tions have proved that each of these planets
duplicates the other in every respect-dia-
meter gravity population cities machines-
everything a duplicate in every minor detail

  the problem is what shall be our atti-
tude toward these planets what will be
their attitude toward each other a grave
even a serious problem quagga that planet
which is at its correct place in its orbit shall
hereafter be referred to as earth one the
other earth two

     uagga nodded they shall so be en-
vtered in our catalogue he said and
left dar tals presence

  dar tal was wearing a thoughtful cal-
culating half-smile on his red scaled face a
half hour later when his subordinates-a
half dozen trade masters-assembled in ses-
sion extraordinaire

  you have heard the news dar tal
asked

  we have heard it sir it has spread to
every corner of mars

  dar tal looked at each martian compel-
lingly

  you realize of course that a grave prob-
lem is on our hands we have certain trade
contracts with a planet known as earth
earth is dependent on us for food as we are
-or were-dependent on her for the arti-
facts of civilization now it is fairly obvious
to you that we cannot supply both earth
one and earth two with the same tremen-
dous volume of exported foods that we for-
merly supplied only one planet

  nor i believe will it be to our best in-
terests to split our food exports between two
planets for then- dar tal smiled slyly
-we will make two enemies where we need
only make one do you follow me gentle-
men

  such a policy will mean that one of the
earths will eventually starve one trade
master said dubiously

  a flash of hatred crossed dar tals face
then it passed

  and why not he said smoothly earth-
lings have always felt themselves superior
to us at times they have treated us like
scum were it not that we needed each other
in order to survive there might have been
open war as it is both planets need us but
we need only one

  but on what basis shall we decide which
planet shall receive our favor

  dar tal sneered

  where are your wits this fine morning
which planet earth one or earth two is
nearer mars   

	   

  there was a knocking on arthur wood-
wards door that morning he opened it
sleepily snugging a robe tight around his
lean waist

  well bob woodward recognized one of
his firmest friends bob denton secretary of
interplanetary affairs he said with sudden
sharpness when denton stood on the thres-
extra earth



hold shivering with a strange dread whats
wrong you look as if youve seen a ghost

  have you heard denton said hoarsely

 about what

  about earth two gosh arthur its on
everybodys lips amateur astronomers then
professionals must have got hold of it first
then the rumor spread a couple of news-
papers have it now i thought it was pop-
pycock until i received the interplanetary
call from captain anders of the trade ship
winko

  woodward was at sea slowly explicitly
denton explained his voice cold wth con-
trolled emotional shock in the last hour he
had received countless frantic queries from
amateur and professional astronomers alike
then from nevspaper editors and finally
from anders

  anders was calling from the other earth
said denton lowering himself shakily to a
seat he was telling me his story-how he
met his duplicate met himself and heres
whats strange about the call arthur sud-
denly the connection was broken i heard a
cry the sounds of a fight the line was dead
what do you imagine happened to anders

  woodward stood quite still until denton
had finished then he moved over to a pol-
ished plastic table picked up a cigarette case
selected one and lighted it he inhaled his
eyes narrowed against the smoke in him a
storm had broken loose and memories of a
dream-what he had thought was a dream-
blew like a nauseous wind through his mind
six old men six malicious entities bored
with themselves on their long pointless flight
through spacial emptiness

  he turned to denton and tld denton his
dream

  arthur you really think that is the rea-
son for what has happened denton began
incredulously

  woodward laughed mirthlessly

  im sure of it what else how else can
we explain this confounded duplication of
worlds would our science be able to per-
form such a feat but six electronic entities
beings whose bodies are pure force who can
control and mold energy the way we pour
steel and probably with less trouble-they
could make such a world

  you shall be doubled that you may enjoy
yourselves twice as much he said softly
six blundering meddlesome malignant
evil old men angrily he crushed his cigar-
ette well denton we have to act and we

have to act fast what will be the political
implications of these dual worlds what will
be our new relations with mars

  first of all-and these are orders-all
space-flight will cease interplanetary radio
communication will shut down the news-
papers will be ordered to make no mention
of the event until a suitable time the audio-
vis networks will refrain from discussing the
subject

  but why denton asked why all these
precautions

wroodward snorted how do we
know earth two will be friendly

  denton was pale

  but theyre us arthur theyre you and
me and everybody else you cant hate your-
self- he stopped faltering

 woodward smiled ironically or can
you

  on that note denton left and in the time
left before the blanket restrictions were put
through woodward tuned in his televis set
and listened to broadcasts originating from
all over earth in that way he secured a
picture of a stunned humanity and in the
mind of each human being was one paralys-
ing thought what is the other me like
how will he affect me

 from one such broadcast woodward
learned bitterly that already at least one big
newspaper editor had put through a call to
his double on earth two woodward broke
all laws in having the man brought before
him

  the editor was pale harrassed but his
voice was savage as he answered woodwards
questions

  sure the political implications are going
to be fierce but do you vealizt the really
big issue my newspaper carries advertise-
ments paid for by various martian food-sell-
ing and manufacturing concerns which
newspaper his or mine both being identical
will continue to receive those advertising
contracts

  perhaps the martians will give contracts
to both your newspapers suggested wood-
ward

 yeah listen here woodward youre
president you should know the answers
marto-tellurian relations are symbiotic we
depend on them entirely for food and they
depend on us entirely for machinery and all
the mechanical doodads and artifacts that
keep a civilization going but now there are
	startling stories

two earths and the martians need only one
why we couldnt grow enough food on earth
to feed a million people a year so whats
going to happen if mars sends all her food
exports to the other earth

  woodward had not been unaware of the
problem on the contrary it was sharp in his
consciousness he was merely trying to cap-
ture the quality of peoples feeling toward
earth h before he acted a ruler needs to
know the instinct of a people in order best
to serve them his gray sharp eyes bored
into those of the editor

  youve seen your double talked with
him woodward said whats your feeling
toward him

  the editor flinched then a dogged ex-
pression came to his craggy face

  ill tell you the truth woodward i hate
his innards

  but hes you

  is he hes got my newspaper hes got
my wife and my kids hes got my body
whats he going to do with them

  youve got your own newspaper wife
kids and body woodward reminded the
editor humorlessly

  the editor was baffled

  i dont know why i hate him he growled
its psychological id say but i do know
this earth two is where earth one was two
weeks ago and the people are the people
of two weeks ago that means that my dou-
ble is going to be influenced by different
events that ive been influenced by in the
last two weeks and if mars sends earth
two all her food then the events on earth
two are going to be so different that the
people of earth two will be different from
us environment affects character

  the editor left leaving woodward with the
paramount question on his hands what
would be mars attitude only one direct
way to get the answer he made a long-dis-
tance interplanetary call to dar tal

  soon the martians studiously polite red
face appeared on the televis screen

  weve been waiting to hear from you dar
tal woodward said civilly

  i am sorry mr woodward dar tal said
smoothly but the press of business-our
new policy which has been forced on us-
has prevented communication

  what new policy

  dar tal explained at great length making
numerous pleas for understanding

  thus mr woodward we have been

forced to choose between two planets he
finished we have chosen earth two ob-
viously earth two is many millions of miles
nearer mars which means less time in trans-
portation not to speak of lowered shipping
costs however do not be too alarmed
whenever earth one comes closer to mars
than earth two then we shall do business
solely with your planet

  woodwards anger spilled over his voice
was the voice of thunder

  do you realize you are condemning a
planet to death we have imported food-
stuffs from your planet as we needed them
we have no vast granaries stocked with food
before a month is up my people will be on
the road to starvation and it will be more
than a year before earth one finds itself
nearer to mars than earth two do you
realize that your action may plunge us into
war

ar tals secondary eyelids now
opened in that case mr woodward
you will find mars able and ready to protect
herself he said contemptuously

  it was dar tal who closed the connection

  for long moments after this graphic real-
ization of catastrophe had been laid before
him woodward stood stiffly then he called
the earth exchange service

  this is arthur woodward he told the
operator you will lift the ban on inter-
planetary communication only to the extent
of making a connection with arthur wood-
ward of earth two  

  he had been bulwarking himself against
this ordeal all day he had been trying to
convince himself that standing face to face
with a man identical in every way they
would share the same views the same
thoughts but now as arthur woodward
twos image appeared he knew it was not
so for woodward one was the underdog

  instantly they hated each other it was
not a clear reasoning hatred it came from
the emotions which knows no reason it
rose out of a resentment of the ego which
must feel its own supreme individuality the
ego knew fury because it faced another ego
which presumed to be its exact equal to
share a brain and a body that rightfully be-
longed to one of those egos

  there was the clash of egos the irresistible
force meeting the immovable object had
one of the egos been superior the other
would have bowed before it as it was they
extra earth



collided and the friction-heat of the collision
was hatred

  arthur we wish to avoid war wood-
ward one said faintly

  do we the other arthur said coldly

  desperation twisted woodward ones face

  we must mars has already befriended
you deserted us but you by agreeing to
trade with us to allow us half the food-
stuffs that come from mars can save people
who are no less yours than if they lived on
earth two

  what will you give us in exchange for
food woodward two said calmly

  woodward one stared machines he
faltered the products of machines books
kitchen ut-

  he stopped

  and the other woodward laughed with
cruel pity

  arthur has fear of the future clouded
from your mind the one clear truth in all
this grisly mess listen

  he uttered each word incisively gray eyes
intense

  arthur friendly relations between earth
one and earth two are forever impossible
what does earth one have that earth two
doesnt have already why should you sup-
ply us with machines we already have in
duplicate why supply us with books when
we have the authors of those books and the
books themselves what ideas what new
thoughts what cultural advantage will one
planet ever have over the other

  what is there to trade tangible or in-
tangible why should we be friendly we
have nothing to gain and never will have

  but-but you will be in precisely our
position when mars comes nearer earth
one

  if famine and its consequent diseases have
not already killed everybody of earth one-
which it will said woodward two softly

  and now woodward twos eyes darkened

  arthur the peoples of our planets hate
each other i hate you-you hate me dont
deny it its infernally intolerable for me to
remember that an exact equal of me exists
so this i know there will be everlasting
feud unless you and yours die and believe
me we want you to die you are excess
humanity without the right to exist

  woodward one paled with fury

  you dare to say that you the shadow
world the unreal world the copy of our
world as martian astronomers can prove

  woodward two shrugged faint mocking
lines around his lips

  but who shall say which is the more real
-the copy or the original really arthur

  woodward one could endure no more he
closed the connection sank trembling to a
seat covering his haggard face with his
hands

  there would be war for woodward two
had spoken truth and irony of ironies he
had spoken as woodward one would have
spoken under the same conditions the peo-
ples of both earths could not continue to
exist it would be the people of earth i who
would lose this war for food is the greatest
weapon   

  military law ruled earth i her economy
was in the rigid hands of the state and
though starvation was setting in her fac-
tories roared at top speed converting peace-
time vessels into war craft earth i was iso-
lated from the sources of life and gearing
itself for certain death

  five weeks after the ultimatum from
woodward two a small battered lifeship
entered earths atmosphere the last thou-
sand feet the torn hulk of metal went out
of control and a figure parachuted from the
airlock landing hip-deep in the yellow muck
of the amazon delta

a week later a uniformed officer asked
admittance to woodward ones pres-
ence

  the military police in a little brazilian
village recently sent me a man they rescued
from the jungle he said earnestly niis
man claimed he was from earth two but
belonged to earth one after he was patched
up he said it was urgent that he see you
so i have him here now

  who is he

  a captain anders of the trade ship
winko

  woodward one shook anders hand a few
moments later noting the wan pinched look
of a man who has suffered greatly

  i remember your name woodward one
said slowly you spoke to the secretary of
interplanetary affairs from earth two-then
you were suddenly cut off

  i was cut of because that was the mo-
ment woodward two ordered my arrest
anders said bluntly he had me thrown into
jail as well as my crew but one member
of my crew had the good sense to fade out
of the picture later on he was able to ar-
	startling stories

range ray escape in a middle-ize pleasure
cruiser woodward twos police pursued me
and burned the ship out of the sky i have
no doubt they were sure they killed me but
i escaped in a bunged up lifeboat and got to
earth

  woodward one felt an electrifying excite-
ment

  and why did woodward two arrest you

  because i shook hands with my duplicate
and my duplicate vanished as if he had never
been woodward two didnt want that news
carried to earth one dont you see sir
well never beat earth two in war we need
another way and i think ive found it

 how

  anders eyes held a fierce delight mr
woodward theres a card game called old
maid in which duplicates cancel out dupli-
cates but before the cards are dealt one
card is withdrawn from the deck leaving a
card which has no duplicate-the old maid
the loser holds the old maid at the end of
the game

  i propose sir that we consider the popu-
lations of earth one and earth two as the
cards in the deck and i propose that we
change the rules of the game somewhat so
that i the old maid whose duplicate has
been withdrawn from the deck be on the
winning not the losing side-you under-
stand sir

  woodward understood   

	   

  the spaceship from earth i entered the
atmosphere of earth ii it dropped straight
down toward the untraveled pacific ocean
it was night there were gunners on the
flanks of the spaceship watchful for signs of
enemy craft the spaceship glided close to
the dark swells heading shoreward it landed
on an uninhabited section of the oregon
coast and disgorged twelve men from the
airlock the spaceship left choosing the
same inobstrusive route back to interplane-
tary space

  the twelve men left behind silently shook
hands and each with his small leather grip
set out in different directions through the
forest each was on his own

  robert denton secretary of interplanetary
affairs walked endlessly he was one of the
dozen men the others were men equally
high in public office on earth i denton was
on his way to philadelphia

  it took him a week he found a road and
then a city he used good earth i money to

buy a seat on an earth ii stratoliner his
only disguise was his blank open expression
he was apparently an ordinary citizen of
earth h

  once in philadelphia ii he headed for the
park near the depot

  denton i always took a walk with his wife
in the park at  so did denton ii denton
i hid to one side of a shadowy path and
waited

  denton n came soon enough walking
slowly with his wife and as denton ii
passed him denton i stepped behind him
waited until the woman was looking away
then laid a heavy hand on denton ifs
shoulder

  darling the park is so restful at this
hour anabel ii mused turning her pretty
head then her breath caught why bob
youre so dressed up werent you wearing
a sport outfit

  was i denton laughed fondly until his
heart stopped racing he patted her hand
you must be getting absent-minded dear
truth is im not a quick-change artist

  so it was over all of earth that day dupli-
cates creeping up behind duplicates

  and in days to come more ships and more
made the trip from earth i smuggling high-
ranking passengers

  the hand had been dealt the game was
being played   

denton one had a visitor at his home
a few weeks later-a man wrapped in
a heavy scarf and wearing thick dark glasses
denton took the man to his room-and ar-
thur woodward one ripped off his disguise
they shook hands warmly but there was a
haunting despair on dentons thin face

  arthur until yesterday morning i
thought everything was going fine he said
shivering vvve smuggled in most of the
members of the cabinet and half of the pro-
vince governors from earth one all have
successfully canceled out their duplicates the
way we planned now it remains only for
you to complete the link to cancel out wood-
ward two then we can act but now im
afraid

  dentons fear caught at woodwards heart

  what do you mean

  woodward two called me into conference
yesterday ostensibly it was official business
regarding some shipping of machinery to
mars but he was really sounding me out
luckily i had crammed on denton twos
extra

notes and so i could answer most of the pry-
ing questions he asked me but im con-
vinced i might have tripped up a few times
if i did then woodward two is aware that
theres been a slow infiltration of high of-
ficials from earth one how he began to sus-
pect i dont know unless various members
of his cabinet slipped up acted in ways
which did not jibe with the actions of their
duplicates whom they canceled out

  it wouldnt have taken much for im cer-
tain woodward two lives in deadly fear that
somehow earth i will discover a secret he
must have taken pains to keep to himself
that people of earth one can cancel out their
duplicates of earth two but if he is sus-
picious what will we do

  woodward one sat down throwing his
head back against the chair closing his eyes
wearily a long hard trip first from earth
one then across the continent afraid to draw
a deep breath or act naturally for fear some-
one would recognize him and had he made
that trip had he indeed seen the completion
of all those other plans only to realize finally
that woodward two was in a position that
would enable him to turn off the fire under
the boiling pot

  bob what plans have you made for me
to exchange places with woodward he
said heavily

  a house party here tomorrow night
woodward will come also a half hundred
other people many of them who belong to
earth one

  go ahead with those plans then we
cant back out if we fail we fail bob but
we mustnt fail and we wont

  in his room the next night woodward
could hear from below the sounds of gayety
-music the clink of glasses the laughter of
men and women he was dressed for the
occasion in tails and white tie he stood with
hands straight at his sides the fingers mov-
ing nervously denton had told him an hour
ago that woodward two had arrived wood-
ward one had paced his room filling with a
destroying fear this was fantasy beyond
imagination that he should think of his
alter-ego as a man to be feared hated-to
be destroyed yet he must act

  he had moved two steps toward the door
when it slowly opened

  woodward froze a beefy man stood on the
threshold his eyes widened incredulously
on woodward one for the space of a dozen
heartbeats the two men stared then a half-

earth	

scream came from the mans throat

  woodward one

  his hand darted to his lips the hand held
a whistle the terrible implication of that
whistle flooded over woodward there were
plainclothes men in the house looking for
woodward one and acting under woodward
twos orders if the whistle blew it meant
the end

  he acted with a desperate speed that would
never be possible to him again he leaped
at the man grabbed his hand then dealt him
such a savagely violent blow along the side
of the jaw that he fell to his knees and crum-
pled over onto his back he closed the door
struck the man again brutally he worked
fast a towel for a gag strips of sheeting for
bonds then he shoved the unconscious man
under the bed

  tensely he stood at the door the thrum of
blood in his temples drowning out whatever
sounds mught be in the hall but he took
a chance left the room and crept silently
along close to the wall by a back stairs
route he reached the floor below here
through portieres he could see the swirl of
gayety he also saw his alter-ego woodward
two again came the blind raw hate the
urge to destroy even as that woodward had
wanted to destroy him and his kind

  but woodward two was at the center of a
laughing drinking crowd a crowd which
was doubtless his consciously planned bul-
wark

  suddenly he heard a whispering footstep
from the top of the stairs a cold shudder
of fear shook him he got hold himself
knowing what he would have to do-and he
would have to use all the brassy nerve he
could summon to the job he swiftly climbed
the stairs

  halfway up he stopped

  come here you bungling fool he
snarled youre making enough noise to
wake the dead

  a bluff but his only hope of success
     lay in bluffing

  there was a silence then a figure came
to the stairs looking down at him the man
came down the stairs sidewise cautiously
and when he saw woodward he whipped a
gun from his pocket and trained it on him

  youre under arrest he snapped

  woodward went straight up the stairs de-
liberately grabbed the gun and shoved it
aside
	startling stories

 you fool he stormed who do you
think i am

  the man still held the gun he brought it
around swiftly

 you might be woodward one sir he
said but uncertainty was there

  woodward cursed explosively

  you see you see already youre fall-
ing for his trick come with me you idiot

  he led the man to the floor below point-
ing through the portieres

 theres woodward one

  but-but its impossible sir the man
said he wouldnt walk right out there into
the middle of the crowd

  wouldnt he woodward laughed harsh-
ly why not i left the room for a few
moments and he simply entered and took
my place now if i go out and claim him to
be an impostor hed have me arrested i
wouldnt stand a chance so the only way
we can work it is to create some confusion
get your men together-move and heres
what i want you to do

 woodward talked so rapidly the man
hardly had a chance to question the proceed-
ings he was convinced at the moment how-
ever whether he would remain convinced
was a question

 but woodward had his answer to those
doubts not five minutes later when the con-
fusion he wanted came there were six door-
ways to the ballroom besides the exit door
into the night outside suddenly almost at
the same second flames and smoke shot from
them and a swift crackling overrode the
sounds of merrymaking

  the music stopped there was a clattering
of glasses the stoppage of voices and people
stood rooted staring at sheets of flame then
there were screams and pandemonium

  fire

 the cry was taken up by half a dozen
throats denton and one or two others tried
to bring order out of the retreat but it was
a stampede frightened people ran for the
single exit that was not ablaze

  woodward one chose that moment to run
onto the ballroom he ran straight for wood-
ward two who was one of the people trying
to organize the others into a single file so
they could leave through the door in the
quickest possible time he was shouting an-
grily woodward one was almost on him
when woodward two saw him coming

  an animalistic scream burst from his cord-
ed throat he could have been no more

terrified if a demon were after him for
woodward one was his demon his personal
nemesis he knew he could not count for
help on the crazed people around him his
hand darted into an inner pocket came out
with a vibro-gun it loosed a flame that was
like a thin string stretched from the bore of
the gun to woodward ones shoulder

  woodward smelled his own clothing and
flesh burning but he felt no pain beyond a
sickening numbness through his right side

  then somebody blundered past woodward
two knocked the vibro-gun from his hand
and woodward one scooped it up and
lunged toward his duplicate again

  woodward twos face was twisted with
shock he turned ran he plunged straight
for the broad winding staircase that led to
the upper part of the house woodward one
went after him panting his duplicate was
a man crazed with fear and woodward one
knew coldly that if he had been in the same
position his emotions would have been the
same	

  in the upper part of the house woodward
two ran into a trap he should have turned
a ramp to the right and made it to the roof
and possible escape instead he blundered
past into a dead-end hallway

  woodward one stopped a few feet from
where his duplicate was plastered against
the wall his shoulder was hurting abomin-
ably there were the warning signs of dizzi-
ness and shock he disregarded them he
looked on woodward two and he almost felt
pity at the high shine of fear in his duplicates
eyes

  woodward two spoke his voice horrible
with hate and fear

  so this is it he said and i suppose
according to all the laws of logic that i
should submit for though my body disap-
pears i will continue to live in you he was
panting but its not the same thing you
hear me my ego is mine it fights for life
arthur-go now take yourself back to
earth two and this i promise you earth i
will receive food

woodward one moved forward an-
other slow step arthur its too
late he said tightly youve already pro-
nounced your own sentence you wanted
us to die of famine as it happens you of
earth two will die but much more merci-
fully you see arthur once there were six
old men  
extra earth

 and he told woodward two about his
dream it was a memory the two wood-
wards did not share of course because the
earth that had been duplicated was an earth
of two weeks ago and while woodward one
talked filmy curtains were rushing across his
vision his eyes were winking in the tic that
precedes fainting he was telling woodward
all this-why because he thought in con-
tempt for his own weakness he was trying to
grasp from somewhere the courage that
would allow him to destroy-himself

  you arthur will return to the hyper-
space you came from he went on haltingly
for as nearly as we can figure earth two
was formed of matter and energy drawn from
hyper-space a space lying next to ours sep-
arated by one dimension we know that this
must be so because the only source of mate-
rial to build earth two was the asteroids
but the asteroids remain therefore the en-
tities must have had the power to draw un-
tapped reserves of energy from hyper-space

  earth ii belongs to hyper-space it is
composed of atoms formed of negastrons and
positrons negative matter contra-terrene
matter which until now has been only hypo-
thetical and that contra-terrene matter re-
quires only the correct pattern of energy to
throw it off balance to tumble it off into the
space it came from duplicate objects of nor-
mal matter can thus cancel out their twins
and i arthur contain in my body the exact
matrix of force necessary

  he had talked too much he had waited
too long for the black cloud came ovehis
mind-and through that cloud he saw a
streaking figure woodward two he was a
blurred shadow woodward two was plung-
ing under woodward ones clumsily out-
stretched arms

  woodward two turned stupidly holding
the vibro-gun pointed at the fleeing figure
he was thinking calmly he was clearly
conscious of the sucking pain sweeping
through one side of his body he was more
conscious of what woodward twos escape



meant woodward one would of course die
and woodward two would grill various
members of his cabinet and eventually dis-
cover which of them came from earth one
he would discover the details of the plot
and that would be the end of it

  woodward one fired

 he knew he had missed of course he
couldnt help but miss when his eyes were
playing havoc with his muscles and nerves
yet woodward two stumbled

  incredulous woodward one staggered to-
ward him it was true woodward two was
on his knees he collided with woodward
two his legs buckled and he fell over the
wounded man and in the moment before
blackness came he felt the solidity of wood-
ward two vanish in his place an empty rack
of clothing which for a moment maintained
its form then the clothing fell in a heap
and woodward one fell across it and be-
fore he lost consciousness he felt a supreme
moment of gladness   

  he awoke looking into dentons anxious
face denton gripped his hand fiercely

 weve won arthur he whispered
those fake fires-i realized what was taking
place i came up the stairs just as you fell
but youll be all right strong emotion
surged through his voice weve got control
of the government arthur mass smuggling
will be possible with the people of earth two
none the wiser as to what is going on some-
how well smuggle enough food back to earth
one to hold off starvation until everybody
is brought from earth one and cancels out
his duplicate on earth two

  woodward returned the pressure warmly
he relaxed sighing

  and well never depend on mars again
bob well have an extra earth a planet
suitable for agriculture thats where our
food will come from his voice turned grim
with satisfaction and his glance went up-
ward as if seeking out the red planet

  then well see how they like getting along
without us he said

the ether vibrates

continued

  manly wade wellman is at the controls
this time out and his narrative tells of the
solar invasion another epic tale of
space conspiracy in which curt newton tan-
gles with an old foeman u quom who sup-
posedly was driven into the sun out of con-
trol many months ago

  but u quorn escaped thanks to a com-
bination of ingenuity and luck and after an
appropriate period spent nursing his wounds
and rebuilding his pirate crew is back in full
operation the first warning terreans have
of his return is when the moon vanishes-
and apparently curt newton and the future-
men with it

  by this time it is almost too late-or would
be if captain future had not managed to
evade destruction by a fluke after this
terrestrial pearl harbor it is warfare to the
death with the very existence of the entire
solar system at stake

  this captain future novel has all the ele-
ments that go to make up a great science fic-
tion story

  with it is running a distinguished hall of
fame classic-a story which written almost
a decade and a half before the atomic bomb
foretold such an instrument of wholesale
destruction

  it is after armageddon a truly bril-
liant novelet by francis flagg one of the
ablest scientifictioneers who ever lived and-
alas-died too soon

  there will be short stories to match these
two major achievements as well as the usual
departments among them of course will
be that lurking place of the old space dog
since time immemorial the ether vi-
brates

  our next issue should be one to remember
happily long after it is read

yll right snaggie old tooth drag the
xeno and the mail ticker inside the lead
screens we dont want any of the atomic
chain fissions our readers may have initiated
to vaporize the entire ship and before the
sarge runs for cover thanks readers for
getting in so many letters so promptly it
constituted the biggest and best showing
ever which should end the amenities for
this issue if not for all time the sarge is
in battle dress so bring em on froggie
bring em on

  the first letter is the explosive or is
it result of an innocent little query ye
saree voiced in the fall  issue all he

from page 
 asked what what is pascagoula and well
 see for yourselves pee-lots and astroga-
 trixes

what pascagoula is

 by ray corley

   dear sarge ise back again yep its me-the sot
 from the deep south

   saw my letter in the latest issue foamed at the
 mouth and sat down to work on this missive let us
 start

  quote what is pascagoula unquote
 answer pascagoula is a small shipbuilding town
 about  miles from mobile ala what where is
 mobile sno use no one can teach you anything
 about our good or mother earth youre too busy
 guzzling xeno

   valley of the flame-an excellent story which
 demands a sequel pics fby donnel were above
 par for her but still fall far below the standered set
 by orban and even marchioni

   twelve hours to live-no good the writing
 was excellent the style was the same-everything was
 alright except the last few paragraphs but they
 stank and ruined the rest of the story not that the
 writing was bad but it was where he ended the story
 i will wonder to the end of my days whether david
 grant got out of the fix he and his wife were in

   shadow over venus-oh i guess it was al-
 right but i hate to admit that one of longs stories is
 good

   the dark angel has been rehashed so many
 times that it failed to be interesting

   the ether vibrates-i repeat where in the
 h   is joe kennedy it has been three issues
 which do not seem the same without him oh well
 i must be brave

   a terrible mistake has been made and when i say
 terrible i mean it a year-old letter which i wrote
 about iron men and didnt have the nerve to mail
 has been mailed pray god i hope you dont print it
 in fact i plead with you dont print it

   now for a story by me walt sarge dont drown
 yourself in the xeno this will not be too bad you

   ye sarge spat a mouthful of powerful acid xeno
 out the spaceship door it fell earthward burning
 the air as it went there was a terrific explosion
 which made the atom bomb sound like a cap pistol
 the xeno had struck the earth the explosion wrecked
 the wood killing all the people except one-me

   i climbed into my space rocket and sped skyward
 i was out for vengeance not because my poor old
 pop was blown up-no it was because my only
 copy of the eternal now was destroyed grrrrr

   an outbreak of sounds came from your ship ye
 sarge was imbibing the forbidden juice of the xeno-
 burg plant a bullet sped from my atomic pistol it
 blew ye sarge to fine particles which would never
 write foul poetry about me my revenge was com-
 plete

   there sarge howd you like that wha hes
 fainted- e th st bayonne n j

     upon recovring from our swoon
     and feeling not a bit the worse
     we undertake corleys undoin

     by seeking our revfenge in verse

     the pics for valley of the flame
     were not by sister donnel done
     rather to your eternal shame

     our wilbur thomas was the one

     so now well don our festive rayon
     and dance ourselves a red-hot hula
     all the while that we are bayonne
     to good old tasty pascagoula


the ether

 oh ye sarges aching little grass shack
roll out the xeno wart-ears here is the
answer to corleys other question

this-this-is whats hap-
pened to joe kennedy

by joe kennedy

  dear sarge the icy blasts whirled across the frozen
plains of pluto numb with cold my feeble senses
reeling i lashed harder at the scampering team of
moon pups they howled in agony as the stinging
point of the whip ripped across their scaled backs

  the purple snow was blinding now i staggered
and the sled swerved sharply overturning in a moun-
tainous heap of snowflakes i choked gasped lor
breath the moon pups freed from the rems were
dashing away thefr barking faded in the distance
and they were swallowed into the storm

  i was alone  alone in the frozen wasteland or
pluto without food or shelter alone in the fiercest
blizzard ever known in the history of the barren ninth
planet death stared me in the face death to the
right of me death to the left of me death up down
across sideways never more to see the ween fields
the spawning cities of mother earth twas most
unnerving

  in ten minutes i was frozen stiff

  the body was never found either

  being a modest chap by nature i won t request
that a national holiday be declared to celebrate my
return to the columns of dear old startling a simple
-gun salute will suffice	 

  i bet this is the only letter you receive that doesnt
menuon the fact that the cover to the contrary clark
ashton smith didnt write twelve hours to live
the announcement that cas will appear in next
issues hall of fame was welcome news tho i al-
ways read the hof first and enjoyed the williamson
story tremendously shades of frank stockton and
are there any ladies or tigers in the audience

 the return of startling and tws to bi-monthly
schedule was another pleasant surprise three
months between each issue was far too long to wait
every other month is more like it   

  leave us meander on to the ether vibrates lieut
williamson d charles millard grimes harold
cheney lin carter and a few other people wrote
some very readable letters mrs patsy martins letter
was just one o them thar things that pop up every
now and then the sarges answer was a minor
masterpiece of diplomacy

  ah people continue to squander rehms and rehms
of paper caricaturing the old space dog t mason
was responsible for that-uh-thing on page  hes
in no position to criticize startlings art tskl

  the great american pastime seems to be ferreting
out scientific flaws in the stories irwin friedman
has started something i quote how could a blow
on her helmet knock joan unconsciousness unless it
went through the helmet i think they would make
them stronger than that   end of quotation

  well frankly our own skepuclsm is aroused in
the interests of science irv would you consent to a
little experiment come around sometime in a flimsy
space helmet of the type supposedly worn by women
of the future then let me take a crack at you with
a hefty baseball bat if i fail to knock you uncon-
scious ill at least guarantee to give you a bit of a jar

  but friedman has discovered my secret yes be-
lieve it or not meek bespectacled josephus q ken-
nedy by day reporter for the daily vampire is
transformed by night into that dynamic man of
mystery-the blue bern

  ill let you birds into my confidence ysee i
was bom on the planet krypton several million
miles distant when my parents found that the
planet was doomed to be destroyed they stuck me
inside of an oversized bullet and shot the infant
kennedy to earth just as the stinky little planet

 by time the projectile arrived my body was
fully developed i immediately assumed the identity
of kennedy the mild reporter and stfantasy fan
but by night i don my snazzy costume with the
orange stripes and purple spots and become that
dynamic man of mystery-the blue bern

  the blue bern wears his orange and purple suit
under kennedys regular street clothes ready to

vibrates	

change at a moments notice machine-guns batter-
ing rams atomic bombs bean shooters-all are pow-
erless before the devastating might of the bern

  the bern can grind up steel bolts with one crunch
of his mighty molars he can travel faster than the
speed of light i never do this any more tho since
i discovered that when i travel that fast my body
turns into static electricity i got some nasty shocks
for awhile before i figured this out

  as the blue bern i am more powerful than speed-
ing locomotives and can toss ten-ton weights around
like soap bubbles i have devoted my life to the
destrucuon of war crime riots prejudice vice
hatred evil injustice inhumanity bestiality and
excess gastric acidity	

  hated and feared by the minions of the under-
world the blue bern keeps his true identity a secret
by donning an innocent exterior and writing letters
to startling stories every couple years for a nom-
inal sum the bern will be glad to endorse shaving
cream cigarettes toothpaste underwear or what
have you kiddles under ten desiring my autograph
be sure to enclose one dollar in three-cent stamps
plus fifty cents cash to cover wear and tear on the
fountain pen

  of course i know i can trust you chaps to keep
this a secret it is told to you in the strictest con-
fidence

  ah it might as well be spring everywhere amidst
the snowdrifts posies are budding robins are chirp-
ing little rabbits are rushing around making more
little rabbits and the ether vibrates reflects these
trends and is overflowing with poetry hrrmpf-i
too have written a verse or two

    what fortunate creatures the grulzaks

    theyre never bothered with income taks

    each martian gal has a lovely figure

    and startlings now  pages bigure

    th truth give heed-this is no 

   is that the area of a circle is equal to the
      radius squared times pi

   apple pumpkin lemon merangue and mince-
   startling costs but fifteen cince

  methinks this should hold you for the time being
will be seeing you on the next trip around the
system- baker avenue dover new jersey

ing dictionary drag out the xeno drag out
ye sarge odzooks  

   alackaday here goes the terror of the
spaceways humming a plaintive little dirge
as he tears the hair from his deltoid cover-
ings it goes why didnt kennedy stay in
retirement why didnt kennedy stay in re-
tirement    and so on it can be sung
to the tune of john brown had a little en-
gine if anyone cares to use it in his bubble-
bath no frogeyes you dont pour a bub-
blebath with the gum of the same - name
thats sticky in fact it sticks in spades
but once again here goes   

in speaking of those spawning cities
which kennedy makes sound so fecund
whoever -thought hed steal my pretties
from oscar hammerstein the second

it may be spring for kennedy
but oer the world icicles bloom
for when he sings a threnody
cold dirges sound their oompah-boom

blue bern a-flashing through the skies
or grulzak grazing in sweet clover
when kennedy doth poetize
ye sarge might just as well roll over


startling stories

with which our sonnet nears its appointed
    conclusion

and this old space dog is stepping out for
    a quick transfusion

columbus discovers bergey

by jacqueline grenier

  dear sarge you may be rather startled by this
letter though i suppose you very rarely are in said
state im afraid that iu have to write in english
as i am unfamiliar with the language of the planets
though i am a student of the ciiinoe language it
doesnt seem to be of any help in understanding the
letters your saleutes huh whjtt are they ss
write you

  now as to my motives-i have two neither ad-
verse one a defense and one a compliment the
defense is lor ycair artists please people dont look
at the illustrations in that tone of voice pity the
poor artist-doesnt anyone ever say anything good
about him your people dont know what luoky
chaps they are at least you havent come up with
an abstraction or a painting by salvador dali praise

a as to the other motive-i think the science-fictlon
welters have remarkable foresight im sure that
sometime in the future your stories owiu be classified
history instead of fiction however -your readers
ve in the future they are not only citizens of the
world but ciuzens of the universe- when the ume
comes for science-flctlon to drop the flcuon the fans
under their guiding genius saturn will lead the
earth

  though i am but an irregular reader of stf your
magazine does seem to be one of the best thats
all-except that i like your covers monsters and all
so there-columbus ohio

 so now the sarge is going to rule the
earth-someday brush up my swallowtail
trousers froggie and shake out the jovian
mothballs theyre powerful little lepidop-
tera repellents weu have to put up more
of a front wart-ears get busy rigging some
tri-dimensional placards announcing the
great event no snaggletooth stand by for
xeno

  and as for you jacqueline thanks thanks
a lot

another columbian

by millard grimes

  dear sarge congratulations
   for going bl monthly

for publishing some good shorts for a change

  	for having such good covers lately

  	for going back to having  pages and there-
fore a longer tetter section

  enuft of that as you probably gather i liked the
march ish of ss pretty well ether vibrates was
very good why dont vou giveprlzes for the best
letters free issues of ss or tws or something like
that

  usually your shorts including the hall of fame
are pretty bad this issue wns an exception longs
tale was best of the shorts the others following in
their order on the contents page air were good
novel was only passable inside pics are improving
marchlont is still bad though hope stevens is good
as you say

  s im in great need of some old copies of
cap future startling thrilling wonder or any other
sf mags if any fans can help me please do so-
by the way sarge when is cap future coming back
out please let it

  warning am fixing to put out a fanzine fans
prepare sarge also prepare ill send the first
copy -winging your way

  and everybody remember i want old sf mags
when i say old i mean before - tenth

 thanks again is this epidemic of sargeo-

ehiliir confined only to the varldos colum-
uses in te temd according to receht

that storm lake simoon
 is back

by david olson

 my dear mr-ulpl-i mean sergeant saturn per-
haps you remember me but lust in case your irre-
sponsible guzzling of that inconceivably potent ellxer
xeno has at last obscured that lonely cell i shau
refresh your wnemory i fcrote you a nice kind let-
ter a few issues toack xa real masterpiece or sumpin
in which i very tactfully pointed out the remarkable
resemblance between a certain fellow on the fall
issues cover-and a famous gentleman named colonna
no doubt taow that i have refreshed yoar- memory
you-remember me no doubt but evenif you don t
it really -doesnt -make any diflerertce

  when i wrote teat letter i wrote it with the hope
it might carry through a lew purposes i had in mind
i wrote it -sarcastically because i felt the cover to
which i referred rated nothing but sarcasm i wrote
it in a rather adolescent and silly vein because i
wanted to see dt in print and i wrote it to star-
tling because i believed startling of all the
stf magazines i could think of off hand needed and
deserved cover improvement the most i sull think

  i am as you may have guessed on a crusade for
better science flcuon covers there are quite a few
fans i think who would like better covers-in fact
i think every reader would appreciate improvement
it is not bergeys painting ability that is inferior-
he seems to toe tibje to present his subjects with al-
most photographic detail-it is his utterly asinlrie
choice of subjects

  not only do thy seem to lack any connection or
valid connection with the story but they are elsd
very laughable n overall effect i cant conceive

sow anyone could dream up -those concocuons take
iq cover on -the march issue for instance

  the first thing that meets the eye naturally is
aco fay telling humorous anecdotes to a purplo

fornlin who seems quite shocked at the whole thing

can tell he is hocked by the way his mld-secuon
has elongated gremlins always do that when they
are shocked in the lower left hand comer we have
another gremlin the father no doubt who seems
irked at being left out of the joke

  i can tell fie is irked by the way his eyes are
bulging and his teeth are straining toward the hori-
zontal gremlins always do that wheb they are irked
directly above the papa gremlin we have uncle cus
who has just tasted something extremely bad i can
tell he has tasted something bad by the way his
mouth has naturally assumed the gargling position
gremlins always do that when they taste something
extremely bad

  then through a process of elimination we come
to serious-minded meat-face who thinks jokes are
very undignified and to show his indignation li
tom his cute blue shirt and assumed the stance
the immortal casey at the throttle it no doubt fl
his simple heart with happiness to pretend he
running a train and then after looking at tl
happy little scene we finally come to the wo
startling blazened in flaming letters across our
view and we must admit wearily that it certainly

  but as the feller said enough is too much so i
shall continue on doing so  como to valley of
the flame by keith hammond this is good this
undoubtedly is the best thing i have ever read in
startling parts of it are as good as something
by merritt especially of rafts first meeting with the
mad king and his experiences in the garden of
kham immediately after the finding of craddock
however the thing regenerates in power

  there are many errors in logic such as rafts fail-

ure to use the amulet to speed up his metabolism
and thus get him to the flame ahead of parror after
they had discovered how to control the amulet
which lessened the worth of the finishing chapter
the description of his fight with parror though
almost made up for it if there had been no errors
i would rate the story as a classic

  i will not comment on the shadow over venus
because i did not read it marchlonls illustration
soured me on it by the way why dont you give
that boy a pen or brush or something to work with
he doesnt seem to be able to turn out very good
work with his finger

  as for the hall of fame story twelve hours to
live where did you find it not only is the writing
stiff the characterization lousy the conversation un-
real but the plot or theme is not even original i
am sure you yourself must remember a story you
read away back in the grades called the lady or
the tiger or something tell me if you think the
main idea is along the same line and to think that
this is the work of the man who wrote the legion
of space the legion of time etc where did
you find it-in some other magazines ash can

  though twelve hours to live left a bad taste in
my mouth the dark angel by henry kuttner
sort of relieved it kuttner as usual is good this
story and the excellent lead novel make this issue
of startling worth remembering lets hope you
can do as well in the future

  this letter would not be complete if i did not re-
mark on the ether vibrates my comments
shall be addressed to one in particular-d charles
to him i say pooey and splfrssk

  in ending this dear sarge i would like to say
that if the march issue would have had a good
cover it would have been the best stf maa out
smile sarge youre being complimented- col-
lege avenue storm lake iowa

 with the back of the olson hand no doubt
oh well what the sarge would like to
know is the connection if any between da-
vid olson and d charles umbilical per-
haps-since they both write from the same
address

  as for the selection of cover topics neither
ye sarge nor bergey is guilty let it remain
a mystery to the fans they seem to get most
of the fun out of it so why spoil a good thing
no comment on the rest of your beefs
david what is there to say besides well
here is another opinion

the other side

by mrs a schmidt

  dear sarge about a year ago i picked up a fan-
tastic magazine and enjoyed it so much i havent
been able to pass up a magazine stand since without
stopping to see what i could find

  ive been very much amused with the gripes they
are mostly that in the ether vibrates except for
one thing-and now im going to tell you about it
there seems to be an age-old gripe about the un-
derdressed heroine and its getting under my skin
cant you you tell them that fundamentally this is
what attracts the reader to the magazine or is that
one of your professional secrets

  true there are a few individuals who would rather
look at a robot than a pretty girl but thank good-
ness they are rare it would be a pretty dull world

  as for the stories i enjoy them all or i wouldnt
read the magazine the illustrations are well drawn
but your artists should get together with the authors
sometimes they dont correspond please give us
more of hamilton and kuttner theyre strictly my

svorites- south downey road los angeles

 bless you my dear why should the sarge
tell them when youve done it for him so

alas poor bergey

by rick sneary

 dear sarge enough is enough i at last bergey
nas gone to far even for me the utter sickening
horror of it all is enough to make a fan gag the
march cover will go down with me as the worst
cover i have ever had the misfortune to gaze upon
just look at the wonderfull summer cover or even
the winter one that was passable but this thing
oooge look at her eyes

  this is the first beh bug-eyed-heroln i have seen
anl	to fo ue last t and look at that

mouth what is she going to do bite her way out
and the darkly-shaded cheeks just arent natural
why rd rather go out with that cary grant type
hero than that horrid looking heroine and what is
more die isnt at all like hammond described janlssa
chapter  page  why didnt you let bergey read
this instead of the last part of the stoiy

  valley of the flame was very good but not out-
standing i think it was better than the cap future
tale tho not quite as many mistakes by the way
looking back over my flies i see you havent had a
time-travel novel for quite a wiiei how about look-
ing for one how about a chase thru time you
know the kind

  hero trails villain back through time every time
he gets near the villain goes back to another time
hero is cought by villains friends but is helped
excape by strange heroine later falls madly in love
with her how about kuttner he could do a swell
job and the plot lsnt worn to thin

  speaking of kuttner his the dark angel was the
best of the shorts tho it really didnt belong in a s-f
mag i enjoyed it very much get anything this fel-
low does under any of his numerous names

  as always i didnt like the hall of fame story
for one thing i hate stories that leave me wonder-
ing what happened and another thing the answer is
so simple all he would have to have done is to
pull one of the chests off about an eighth of a mile
then tom his clothes into strips and made them into
a rope tied the end around the top of one of the
chests and walked to the end of the rone pulled it
and opened the chest at a safe distance if the fungus
was in it he could have beaten it before it reached
him some heroes arent so smart

  lionel inmans letter almost rated a story heading
it was a wery witty bit of wondering nice first
time i have neard of oscar lion is pretty smart
found an error that i missed id tell you what they
were but thats old stuff

  well i guess that is all this trip it sure is swell

now bergeys a bird

by travis willis

  el sarge altho ive been reading startling for four
years this is the first letter ive pounded out so be
ktnda lenient willya i like many other stfans am
partially human if not completely so ah mel

  and now to the mag itself cover anybody know
where i can find an artist honest sarge why
dontcha toss this bird bergey out to the bems an
artist my kingdom for an artist stories

 valley of the flame a good idea not very
well carried out i always like a time-wnrp tale
but this one turned sour

 shadow over venus this theme has been
used before but even tho i shouldnt have i liked it
the rule is an animal after my own heart
twelve hours to live i love these abrupt
surprise endings they always leave one speculating
as to the fate of the hero and heroine hmmmi
wonder how dave grant got out of that one

  the dark angel hooray bravo excellent
mutants attract me for some strange reason who
knows there may be one peeking over your shoulder
as you read this

  as to the inside lllos ive got no comment they
were all average

 the ether vibrates where does this guy
mason get off passing cracks like that its ye
sarge s feeble attempts to be coherent while under
the influence of xeno that attracts attention to the
readers section thereby bringing in more letters

  i wont rate the letters this ish there was nothing
particularly interesting-that is not in my opinion

these scantes dont scan

by harold maxwell

dear sarge

  pay no hfeed to the clacking mongkeez
  who sneer at the bems on your kivers

  a pest on the breed theyre a pack of wrong gees
  with xeno-hypertrophied livers

  pay no heed to those haggling twitters
  who tear poor old bergey apart
  a plague on all of the snaggle-toothed critters
  who just dont appreciate art

  who are these warts who villify clever
  guys who draw gals in their scanties

  ill fix those cricks yes i will if i ever
  discover what bomb sank atlantis

  or let me discover a man-eating fungus

  or a ray that disintegrates livers

  and then sarge well fix those wart-eared plinkers
  whove the nerve to blast ss kivers

  it should be obvious even to a nit and doubly so
to a nit-wit that the cover of startling stories must
be startling and what can startle people in
these days of atomic bombs nnd radar communica-
tion with the moon obviously only a good old-
fashioned bem

  i have a suggestion however why not leave the
cover just plain blank that would startle pipple
plenty you could title it life in the void  or
the fourth dimension or time marches back-
wards or bergey couldnt make it

  or close-up of art-critics brain or sorry it
went down the drain or come back next month
i mean possibilities are practically endless with
another shot of xeno i could go on for hours

  speaking of xeno a barrel of same to henry

of writing i have yet come across it has a sort of
liquid quality in it its too bad though that he used
a mediocre plot also it was too descriptive to hold
my interest all the way through the story how-
ever was fairly good mainly because of the manner
in which it was written

  all is forgiven though sarge the illustrations for
the novel were very good the first time in a long

startling stories

time especially the one on page 

  im ft lad to hear that s  is going bi-monthly
any chance of some more novels like the ones from
- years is tws also going bi-monthly too
the latest ish of tws was the best in a year or
two

  it has to come i guess the cover flashy colors
nicely drawn figures specially the girls but
her face man suffering satprnlan cave bears
from the expression on her face youd think she
had just seen marchionis illustration for shadow
over venus the poorest story in the ish it wasnt
too bad though

  kuttner i adore you i wotta story it was the
best in the ish by far

  williamson i hate you after reading the story
with baited breath you leave the ending up to usl
may you have marchionl illustrate your next story
if youve ever read the lady and the tiger you
will and that they are amazingly alike and since
the lady and the tiger was written before wil-
liamsons little yam-wonder who copied the other

  polton cross is one of my favorite short story
writers i nope his novel is as good

  lin carters little poem was very amusing d
charles had a good letter also wattsamatta none
of the big shots writffig in lately- east th
street brooklyn so nero york

 thanks for the mixed salad howard old
pee-lot so you think williamson wag merely
copying the late frank r stockton think
again-and you may change your mind yes
kiwi tws is also bi-monthly now and ye
sarge resents that crack about the alleged
big shots look back a couple of years
and youll find a totally different crop of let-
ter hacks from those now operating letter
hacks come and go but ye sarge goes on
forever long may he rave

she hangs in the air

by patricia j bowling

  dear sarge i have just finished reading twelve
hours to live by jack williamson in the march
issue of startling stories i may be just dumb
but the story is left hanging in mid-air what hap-
pened when captain david grant opened the silver
chest is it his wife or the red fungus i certainly
couldnt tell from the story

  i will appreciate greatly your giving me the ending
or at least explaining it ill have no peace of mind
until i know- eads avenue san antonio 
texas

 farewell peace of mind mrs bowling
who knows in fact that was the whole
idea of the story-and not bad for an occa-
sional change from the usual neatly packaged
yarn perhaps there was a cold in the chest
quick frogeyes the xeno ye sarge is
sinking fast

sauted slightly

by michael cook

  dear sarge here goes for my first effort in writ-
ing concerning the march issue of ss-now let us
get down to sirius business joke

  ye gods of mars can that be the cover of ss
it is but oh bergey please keep to the standard
of the winter issue cover it was good

  according to your method the stories rate

 valley of the flame- jugs good but a
little fantastic

  shadow over venus- jugs arrghl

 twelve hours to live- jugs swell more
of the same

 the dark angel- jugs readable but far
fetched

 the ether vibrates-as good as usual

  well old xeno-swlgger thats all for now be seeing
you in the next ish- jameson avenue toronto
ontario

 for that sirius crack kiwi cook you rate
one gallon of xeno vinegar famed for its
corrosive effect on battleship steel diamonds
and the lining of the human stomach pre-
pare to pour snaggletooth the moment we
nab him

all this and elsner too

by henry eisner

  dear sarge i know this is a little late for the
next ether vibrates but im writing not to see
my name jn print but to give you and hank kuttner
hammond my sincerest congratulations for val-
ley of the flame i dont think im using extrava-
gant language when i say that this story was com-
parable to a merritt at his best

  it was certainly one of startlings few classic
tales and will get my vote for one of the best stories
of  regardless of the stories you or other maga-
zines print in the forthcoming months i thought
sword of tomorrow was excellent but valley
of the flame wfls many times better not often
can a scientificuon story come so close to true liter-
ary beauw

  although the plot and action of the story were very
well planned and carried out it was most certainly
this superb writing which made it so enjoyable
the utterly alien atmosphere weird but somehow
strangely beautiful together with such vivid descrip-
tive passages are surpassed as i said before only
by some of merrltfs masterpieces

  thanks again for bringing us such a story i only
hope all of your readers enjoyed it as thoroughly as
i did- cedar grove detroit  michigan

 thanks henry we thought so too ye
sarge would hate to hear you when you have
a gripe on-with that vocabulary zounds

and on the other hand

by robert davidson

 dear sarge well startling stories cant be
good all the time valley of the flame goes into
my lowest category along with the kid from mars
and wings of icarus boy was this story louseeeeyl

  honest sarge after reading thdt junk i thought i
had just come out of a two-hour botany class with
a very boring professor right now i think i know
more about the atnazon country than the natives
ill never eat another green vegetable

  the pics for the novel were good especially the
full pager marchionl loused up the rest of the illus-
trations as usual but as i said ss cant be good
all the time

  on the other hand kuttners little masterpiece
the dark angel rings the bell this ish i recom-
mend it for uie hall of fame to be reprinted around
 the current h of f short was good ill take
a guess that he opened the one with his wife in it
the only reason for saying this is that most stf
stories end happily with the hero paddling  miles
to shore of course encountering assorted monsters

 dear set saturn i have before me the remnants

 mod-

  shadow over venus -nuts i junk it

  twelve hours to live-t first i was a little mad
  but as i sat there with the saliva dripping from my

  iowls i realized i was a bit hasty im still trying
  o conceive the subsequent events of either selection

  boy i wonder where i learned that

  the dark angel-i knew it all along terrible
  the ether vibrates-i think mr friedman has

 something about putting the back cover on the
 front i mean did you notice the beautiful coloring
 the excitement the ability of man to control the
 forces of nature in the fire scene on the back cover
 wonderful

  well keep them coming pee-lot alexan-

   well that winds up the sarge and his mer-

 remember kids give us a line on how youd

 sarge is not exempt so let us know will

book review

  uranium and atomic power jack do
ment and h c dake chemical publishing com-
pany inc brooklyn new york  pp 

the authors of this book on perhaps the
most spectacular subject in science to-
day have done a workmanlike job that
is not too involved for the layman and at the
same time delves deeply enough into the sub-
ject to interest scientific students and re-
search workers

   this book was originally prepared in 
 according to the foreword and the authors
 and publishers through eight appendices and
 a rattier complete bibliography have brought
 their subject matter up to date climaxing
 their work with an appendix on the atomic
 bomb

   naturally a good many of the details con-
 nected with the bomb were shrouded in
 secrecy during the three years in which sci-
 ence industry labor and the military forces
 were creating it however de ment and
 dake have succeeded in lifting aside enough
 of the curtain to show us not only the po-
 tential military power but also the extensive
 field in prospect for industrial development

   your reviewer found particularly interest-
 ing the complete and informative chapter on
 the occurrence of uranium minerals in vari-
 ous parts of the world the average man on
 the street or sitting back in a comfortable
 armchair is of the opinion that the incidence
 of these minerals is rather limited it is there-
 fore extremely surprising to learn that it
 takes eleven pages of the book to list the
 various varieties of uranium-bearing miner-
 als and their locations in parts of the world
 as widely separated as llano county texas
 madagascar belgian congo annerod nor-
 way spruce pine north carolina minas
 gerais brazil fergana russian turkestan
 and a score of other places

   other fields that are explored carefully
 and which establish a strong effective
 groundwork for the researcher in this par-
 ticular science include the physics of
 uranium chemistry of uranium spe-
 cific methods in uranometry and special
 methods in uranometry such as the fluor-
 escent indicators

  students are going to be looking for au-
thentic and far-reaching material in this field
and they may well add this book to their li-
braries as an important contribution to their
reference files

review of the

 by
 sergeant saturn

ye sarge has received a lengthy and
rather flossily prepared screed from
the famed ex-fellow-sarge forrest j
ackerman of the los angeles science fan-
tasy society announcing the atabombastic
detonation of the fourth world science fic-
tion convention in los angeles come july
fourth

  this is a four-day blow-out complete with

kuttner and costume ball pacificon chair-
man is walter j daugherty and member-
ship in this all-out gala we hope may be
purchased by forwarding one dollar 
to him at  west ingraham los angeles
 you who can attend do so with ye
sarges benison

  for the rest the fanzine list this month
is a trifle topheavy with sundry special jobs
all of which rate attention and praise

  joe grulzak kennedy has climbed into the
front rank of amateur publishers with a finely
conceived and executed fantasy re-
view this -page pantagruel of a booklet
contains a chronological report on the year
 in stf thoughtful studies of books re-
print books and professional magazines for
the same period and a very complete fan poll
on just about everything to do with your
and ouc favorite subject ye sarge is
despatching joe a hogshead of xintage xeno

  tom hadley drops us a line complete with
rhode island on lovecraft a col-
lection of personalia about the late great you-
know-who nicely arranged by hadley and
donald m grant illustrated by betty wells
halladay find printed by will sykora a nice
item for those who worship at the lovecraft
shrine

  third on the special-events roster is af-
ter ten years a tribute to the late staft-
ley g weinbaum who died in  even
though it is a year lafe this is an interesting
and tastefully handled job thanks to its com-

   fourth on the list is the fanews pho-

  the fargo blimp which contains as might be
  expected candid shots of some thirty-six
  fans a couple of amusing composographs of
  a trip to the moon by bob tucker and the
  reproduction ahem of the cover of one of
  our competitors a very pleasant christmas

    perhaps as a result of this rather frenetic
  special activity the number of a-list fanzines
  has fallen to seven this trip with only
  phoenix and sunspots among them at
  all familiar where fellows are acolyte
  chanticleer shangri laffaires

  promising new entry

    while we were scratching our head over this one
  a bit of dandruff drifted to a spot on the title page

t is our very definite impression that
since he was honorably discharged from
the army early last year henry kutt-
ner has been forging ahead by leaps and
bounds-and he already had most of the rest
of the stf field lapped a couple of times

 in the dark world he steps right up
into die spot left vacant by the death of the
revered a merritt surely no one else has
shown so masterful a grip on this particular
sort of high imaginative fantasy it seems to
us that he has at all times a clarity which
was occasionally lacking in merritts some-
what surrealistic prose poems

  furthermore so ingenious is kuttner that
he is always able at least to suggest some
convincing causation for even the most fan-
tastic of his themes and gadgets in this re-
spect he is almost certainly unmatched

  but those of you who have already read
the dark world in this issue need no
editorial puffs as to its virtues and those
who havent will learn for themselves in
short order that here is a great fantastic
novel meanwhile the author in jesting
spirit takes time out to explain a little about
himself he is usually clearer when explain-
ing some unearthly happening on a distant
planet but it should give you some idea

 says the author of the dark world

  this is no time to ask me for my biography
the papers say weve just hit radar with the
moon-or something like that anyhow-and ive
decided to live on a california mountain-top
where i can reach up with a long-handled spoon
and dig off valuable mineral deposits from our
satellite i never knew it was so close

  ive decided against having a swimming-pool
though because i dont want all the water sucked
up out of it by the moons gravitational attrac-
tion and ive almost decided against having an

why people do those things to me

  all i-ask is to be left alone to write science-
flction when i get ideas that intrigtfe me how
can i write with the moon shooting radar at me
and i dont know what-all else happening around
orion i rtgver look up any more

  well i was bom grew a while and here i am

 that looks unsatisfactory even to me a bi-
ography ought to have more details in it but the
trouble is i dont know what details things
that interest me dont always interest other
people i am five feet something-im not sure
exactly-weigh  slender as a reed and am
deeply attached to a small dark moustache

change a
tire
at night

mm mtc safety

i most any motorist can change a tire but few can
 change it at night with top speed efficiency - and
safety i night tire-changing can be hazardous - but
eveready flashlights can reduce the danger first
principle says the american automobile assn is

f park of the highway next best placc is on a
 straight stretch of road if you must park on a curve
a light should be set on the road some distance back
be sure neither you nor a bystander blocks off the view
of your tail-light

 keep all your tire-changing tools ded or boxed
together where you can pick them up without
searching or fumbling remove your spare before jack-
ing up car - tugging might push car off jack if alone
set flashlight on a stone in convenient position

 a in your car or at home-wherever you need a flashlight-
  rely on eveready batteries ask for them by name
 eveready batteries have no equals thats why youll find
 them in more flashlights than any other battery in the world
