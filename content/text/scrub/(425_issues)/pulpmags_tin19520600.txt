the man in the casket stirred and
opened his eyes through the
dim blue light of the argol lamps
he could see the machinery had
stopped for a moment he lay there
unmoving looking through the crys-
tal walls of his coffin at surround-
ings that were unchanged over
countless eons outside it was a
vacuum but in the casket the air
was sweet and pure

  by n k homing

      the mist had
  some way of making
  weapons useless -
  all weapons

 he sent his thought to a copper

lever and moved it until there was
the sound of air hissing into the
little room he rose then and stood
upright stepped to the ground for
a moment he looked sombrely on the
crystal of the time casket before
crossing to the chair of thought as
he sat in it a panel in the opposite
wall slid open and a pearly eye of
light winked out at him the
thoughts of the robot were warm
and welcoming as they reached out
to him

  you have stopped the machinery
zandlor the man sent on waves of
pure thought

 the master media have broken
their sleep of suspended animation

structed the time crystal my master

  the man leaned back in the chair
and his slender hands rested lightly
on the arms tell me of the world
since our civilisation zandlor did
man also survive

  the pearly eye grew brighter and
vaylan listened to the memories of
the robot as it drew them from the
great electronic brain it had charge
of man had descended to savages
for long ages but at last he was
building again and had even started
to reach for the stars the planets
had been visited and stations built
on the asteroids the bitter remains
of that dangerous world exploded so
long ago

  he signed then for the brain to
stop and let his own thoughts roam
over the world upwards through
the tons of rock that covered his
underground sanctuary it was a

strange world he saw and for a mo-
ment a painful yearning came for
his own civilisation it must have
been uncountable eons ago it had
spread across the world on other
lands than existed now science had
proceeded on different lines there it
had been the mysteries of the mind
that had been delved into and man
had found there things stronger
than machines and flying craft at
last had come the time when the
eager minds of earth had reached
out to find companionship among
the other planets they had not
fcund that companionship but only
an enemy as alien and dangerous
as it was powerful the mental war
had waged for centuries but at last
earth had seen that that other pla-
net spinning on its orbit between
mars and jupiter must win unless
the last desperate step was taken
it meant their own destruction also
but for the sake of the new civil-
isation that would one day follow
they had had to take it

the great cone of force that was
the result of the mental energy of

 every man woman and child upon
 earth had struck deep into the heart
 of the enemy planet the shock of
 the following explosion had rolled
 across the blackness of space and
 struck at surrounding planets even
 mighty jupiter recoiled mars re-
 ceived his death blow-and earth
 shifted on her axis continents went
 down new lands were formed and
 weakened by the terrible mental
 force they had exerted and the shock
 of a planet exploding men fought
 to live and descended again to sav-
 ages as they did so but vavlan had
 suspected that the master media of
 exploded halcon could survive to
 awake some time in the far future
 and he had prepared before the great
 destruction came now both were
 awake again   

   	 
qeneral bradbury chief of
earths interceptor rockets
looked up from the videograph be-
fore him you have your orders
bob he said grimly get to ceres
as quickly as your ship can make
it station zst-d is in some kind
of trouble they had only managed
to get the sos signals through be-
fore they were cut off

  bob mallory saluted and swung
 out of the room tn the corridor he
 paused wondering just what was
 going on at the ceres station the
 interceptor stations were spread all
 over the asteroids where their
 crews could pounce inwards or out-
 - wards of the system after those en-
 terprising gentlemen who thought
 other people should make them rich
 of course it was possible that one
 of the pirates had descended on the
 station but they rarely did that as
 there was little of value for them
 to lift

   he shrugged and went to get his
 men together for the take-off

    	 
rjhe starshell hung a couple of
miles above ceres station offi-
cially zst-d it looked quite all
right as far as the men inside the
ship could see the lights were on
and the patrol ship itself rested on
the launching platform-yet no reply

 page six thrills incorporated

came to the ships urgent radio en-
quiries

 get the men armed mallory
threw over his shoulder to lt lay-
son i am taking the ship down
he glanced at his co-pilot briefly if
anything happens be ready to take
her up again immediately

 jackson nodded and watched in
the screen as the ship dropped down
and settled her squat base on the
bare rocky ground of the asteroid
the sky outside was the eternal
black of the vacuum and a short dis-
tance away the streamlined build-
ings of the station rose starkly
backed by an amazingly near hori-
zon

  mallory took his hands off the
controls and frowned into the
screen ill go inside with half a
dozen men if i am not back within
an hour act as you think best

  jackson nodded briefly ok
sir

 he watched the other man draw
on the light transparent spacesuit
that withstood such enormous pres-
sures and go outside to cross the
plain with the six volunteers behind
him then disappear inside the door
of the station

  mallory paused inside the airlock
of the building gun in hand then
went cautiously forward one of the
station men was visible nearby he
was dead his face contorted with
terrible agony

 the men looked white as he
straightened up from his examina-
tion how did he die sir lt
lavton asked hesitantly

  mallory shook his head i dont
know theres no sign of any sort
of wound

  they went further into the build-
ing three men were found in the
corridors as if they had been try-
ing to escape willing to die in the
vacuum outside rather than face the
thing that had contorted their faces
with such agony in one of the
sleeping compartments a man had
been caught off guard and his body
was found with the fingers clutch-
ing the bunk so hard his nails had
dug into the soft plastic in the
central communications room were
the other five men of the station
four of them lay in different atti-
tudes on the floor but the fuch was
crumpled up before the radio like
the first man nowhere was there
any sign of a wound

  mallory looked round grimly then
switched on the radio in his helmet
contacting the ship jackson you
had better send doc over he or-
dered there is something here i
do not understand

  are you all right

  so far-but everybody else is
dead and there is no sign yet of what
killed them he switched off the
radio and took a firm grip on bis
blaster a couple of you men
come with me the rest stay here
we take a look to see if we can
find out anything
r hey left the communications
room and made their way warily
along the various corridors looking
into every room nowhere was
there the least sign of anything un-
usual-except for the dead men in
the ship that rested peacefully on
the ramp

  yet the answer was somewhere
inside the building before they had
landed mallory had made minute
examinations of the surrounding ter-
ritory-and no ship had landed
little as he liked it he was forced
to the conclusion that it was some-
thing native to the asteroid that had
caused the trouble and something
cold grew inside him no trouble
had ever occurred before on any of
the little planetoids-certainly no-
thing that involved a weapon like
the unknown one that had killed the
men of the station and the crew of
the ship and if something of the
asteroid-what could live on a
bleak and airless world

  they got back to the communica-
tions room no better off than when
they started- the men left there
had experienced no untoward hap-
penings but were obviously glad to
have the other half of the party
back the first thing mallory no-
ticed however were five little green
stones that lay on the station cap-
tains table

  where did they come from he
asked

  the other men swung round to
look at the stones i did not put
them there lt layson answered-
none of the others had either

  a cold chill ran through the room
and mallory went over to examine
the things more closely they look-
ed like ordinary pebbles but were
a dull malevolent green

  one of the men shivered i  i
can feel something funny sir his
glance was fixed on the stones
they are alive

  nonsense said mallory sharply
how can stones be    he broke
off and recoiled get out of this
room quickly   

  the outlines of the stones were
beginning to waver and smoke off
in a heavy green mist a mist that
was rising also from other parts of
the room they backed away firing
desperately at the stuff but still it
came great clouds of it following
them into the corridors

  its behind us as well sir lay-
son called out desperately

  mallory swung round and saw a
great cloud of the green stuff was
converging on them from the rear
and sent the fiery stab of the blaster
at it the hideous thing recoiled but
there was more of it coming up the
other corridors

  get the ship he threw over to
layson tell them to bring the
heavy stuff we might just be able
to hold out with blasters until then
layson complied and then asked
what is it sir have you ever seen
anything like it before

  no the other man replied grim-
ly but whatever it is it killed
those other men he threw them an
encouraging smile come on roc-
keteers we cant let a bit of gas
get the better of us

  one of the blasters went out of
action and the green cloud imme-
diately converged onto the helpless
man winding itself in writhing ten-
tacles around his head they saw
his features contort in surprised
agonv but drove it back from him
itackson heard the hum of the
j blasters as he ran out of the
ship with his men all of them arm-

wolfe llerscliolt

 jyjartin and brenda perry were
 in trouble with the council for
 education their son willis had
 been handed to them from the incu-
 bator guaranteed to be of standard
 aaa-and at the age of four he was
 rated only as aa the council for
 education insisted that the loss of
 mental vitality in willis was due to
 the faulty way in which they had
 nurtured him during his four years
 in the care of his parents

   the councils decision was that
 willis should go to a school for the
 correction of backwardness in chil-
 dren consequently the perrys
 were in disgrace among their friends

pau fclght thrills incorporated 
for it was anti-social of them to have
neglected their childs upbringing
actually they hadnt been remiss at
all what they had done was to
read a history of the days of the
year  and from it they had
learned of the family relationships
of old times from it too had
grown a yearning in the couple to
have such a family-a family where
there was affection and respect be-
tween parents and children

  so at the age of four willis perry
was enrolled in a school for the cor-
rection of backward children also
martin and brenda perry were or-
dered to attend a series of lectures
on child health they were remind-
ed again that at four years of age
a boy should be able to fully grasp
the immaterial equation also he
should be able to apply the equation
in his play relationships

  many other things also came from
the series of lectures until the

perrys realised that in the four
years since they had last attended
such lectures much had been chang-
ed and much more was expected
from aaa- children so much
more that brenda gripped martins
arm and whispered

  its too much martin its too
much for willis

  dont talk like that whispered
her husband anxiously if you were
overheard i might be dismissed from
the parade

  for the first week willis didnt
seem to change at all tru
he could answer the questions cor-
rectly but he didnt seem to under-
stand the idea of the immaterial
equation

  then about the middle of the
second week he had been enrolled
at the correction school willis show-
ed an amazing grasp of the idea of
matter without material it was al-
most frightening to brenda and mar-
tin to see their small son closing his
eyes twisting up his forehead in
concentration and then slowly melt-
ing out of sight but talking to them
as he did so

  but within two days his face was
no longer torn with worry and con-
centration as he came to grips with
the problem of disappearing into

       all they had to
  do teas give the
  wrong answer to the
  radia quiz    and
  young willis would
  be sent to eternity

immaterial matter and then mater-
ialising again when he was weary
of the sport

  oh martin brenda sighed
whatever possessed us to yearn for
the things that are ancient

  i think i understand   mar-
tin said slowly as if trying to
grapple with thoughts ie hardly
dared think i believe it is some-
thing deep-something inside a man
and a woman-the sort of thing that
makes a bird stay with its nest
even when the danger is great per-
haps-

  you feel an ache somewhere-in
the stomach here queried his wife
softly

  he nodded there was no need
for more words for that ache made
them understand martin reached
out his hand and took that of his
wife and held it firmly as he whis-
pered

  at least we know-at least we
understand

  i think too that willis also un-
derstands brenda said quietly i
think he knows what we are all
losing

  but suddenly they were interrupt-
ed by an exultant cry of delight
from the hall of their apartment
together they ran out and willis
stopped short and his face became
suddenly grave when he saw them
but just a moment later he was
rushing towards them and his eyes
were dancing with a feverish light

  mother father he cried eager-
ly look oh look what i have
now

  in his small hand he carried the
tiny instrument with ease on the
small metal plate at the top was
printed in cold words-radio riddle

  no not that brenda cried
reaching a hand to snatch the thing
away from hef son that is only
for aaax children willis

  but mother im aaax now

cried the boy excitedly i was clas-
sified to-day i knew youd be proud
of me mother and you too father
just watch do you know how to
play radia its easy

  aaax gasped martin perrjr as
if he had had a death sentence pass-
ed on him what if he forgets

 	he made another attempt to
snatch the thing away from the
boy but willis danced back away
from his father and mother and
laughed his delight as he suddenly
turned a small dial on the tiny black
instrument in his hand in that in-
stant he had disappeared from their
sight and the long hall was buzz-
ing and hissing with a myriad
grouping of glowing dots around
which hissed concentric circles of
hissing light

  all you have to do is solve the
riddle cried willis voice from the
nothingness do you see it

  there was still the note of child-
ish excitement in the boys voice as
the man and woman stood there
staring at the patterns being woven
by the hissing circles of light all
their energy was being used to con-
centrate on those patterns some-
where in that maze was the key
the symbol which would allow them
to solve the riddle somewhere but
where

  oh but youre slow willis cried
at them do hurry i cant wait to
make it harder isnt it exciting
mother

  yes darling brenda replied
using that strange word she had
picked up from her reading

  but there was no excitement in
her voice-only the dull fearful
weight of terror and the heavy
breathing of her husband seemed to
enhance that terror it was as if
their combined efforts were as no-
thing before the dancing hissing
circles which wove their fantastic
patterns before them

page ten thrills incorporated
  ill give you a hint came wil-
lis impatient voice what is the
quotient of immaterial x

  of course gasped martin per-
spiration dripping down over his
dark glasses from his forehead
youre at point k

  see willis cried its just like 
said its easy now ill give you a
hard one  

  wait brenda cried desperately
didnt they tell you what can hap-
pen if  if you makea navigation-
al error in plotting your course
back

  willis laughed excitedly at that

  of course they did he replied
impatiently but i know all the
major courses by heart and the
others are so easy to solve why all
you need is the equation for im-
material y

  but are you sure you remem-
ber asked brenda anxiously

  of course of course i remember
ill show you this is a hard one
the boys voice said quickly as he
manipulated the tiny dial on the
tiny instrument in his hand he was
gone gone as he had been gone last
time and the spinning intersecting
lines and arcs of the concentric
circles of light seemed to fill the
whole hall till the perrys were
dizzy from trying to watch them

  for minutes on end there was sil-
ence as the couple concentrated all
their efforts on seeing the key to
the riddle but although they twice
thought they had found it there
came only an extra shriek of
laughter when they called the an-
swer

  its an aaax riddle willis
cried proudly a little later

  no shrilled brenda no wil-
lis

  were only aaa your mother
and i martin perry tried to ex-
plain

  we cant solve it son martin

called anxiously come back its
too hard for us

  all right you two babies willis
laughed i told you it was hard
here i come

  there was a pause during which
the hissing of spinning lines of light
seemed like thunderous noises of
generators and decomposers then
out of the silence came a tiny voice
calling unhappily mother mother
i cant remember the equation for
immaterial y i cant remember

  his voice rose in a wild shrill
scream of terror as he called on
brenda the room was a dazzling
haze of conflicting patterns a
sparkling hiss outlined the man and
his wife as they tensed there seem-
ingly suspended in space

  mother shrilled the childs voice
again quickly oh quickly i got
it wrong

 i cant remember   sobbed
the man doubling up suddenly as
the tension became too much for
his nerves i cant remember  

  then more terrible than all the
hissing sizzling of the spinning
circles of light which had inter-
woven their patterns in a complex
pattern of light and shade there
was silence silence just for a few
hundredths of a second

  it was over suddenly everything
was over their life together their
happiness their hopes for their son
were all finished

  they finished on one final terri-
fied scream from the empty air and
then willis perry had gone two
sobbing figures lay huddled on the
floor of the perrys apartment bren-
da and martin perry had failed to
solve the radia riddle and their son
had failed to remember correctly a
navigational error and willis perry
had spun into the unknown ether
beyond the limits of recall-gone
with a scream into the nothingness
where no equations applied

madness in

  earthmen and mer-

  each other of tcar
  mongering jay ren-
  nart had to find out
  how simply

page twelve thrills incorporated

g c blccck

 tay rennard earthman by
j birth venusian by environ-
ment strode restlessly around the
glowing circle that was the mercury
project and his brain-child a mad
project the rulers of the earth-
venus confederation regarded it
but desperation and the lack of any
other advance to the problem had
caused the confederation to sanc-
tion it and to vote the enormous
credits required for its execution

 the scene was weird and night-
mare-like above a dark sky but
    he closed his own lever   
a blinding fla-sh struck the lower
portion of the leading craft
squarely in the centre

on the far horizon a white streak of
light the specially constructed
spaceship stood in the centre of the
circle of light and heat sending forth
the light and heat beams that made
that tight circle a living oasis in a
desert of death and incredible cold-
ness on the dark side of mercury
already the four jet towers had
been erected creations that looked
like giant radio valves except that
from their black bases the jet-
nozzle projected the whole tower
operating on a great universal joint
to enable the jet to be directed at
any angle

  sooner or later those incredibly
vicious mercurians living on the
narrow strip of their planet between

the broiling heat on the side facing
the sun and the frigid iciness on
the dark side would learn of the
presence of the aliens and attack
attack they would without doubt
with that swift ferocity typical of
them but the task jay rennard
had set himself was not merely to
repel such an attack but to capture
a mercurian-alive that in itself
was a task verging on the impos-
sible and even if he succeeded in
that his real work was only be-
ginning

  genesh the venusian and sec-
ond-in-command of the project ap-
proached rennard the last of the
jet-towers has been tested ren-
nard he waved his many-jointed
arm towards the distant line of bril-
liance that was the horizon towards
the sun were more than ready for
the little beasts

  the little beasts repeated ren-
nard thats the whole trouble ge-
nesh we think of them as little
beasts they think of us as big
beasts for centuries these sense-
less attacks have gone on they will
go on indefinitely costing tremen-
dous energy and wealth and more
important countless thousands of
lives on both sides madness utter
madness

  on their side yes conceded
genesh weve forced no quarrel
on them

  we may have inadvertently
said rennard we dont know their
point of view any more than they
understand ours im satisfied that
once we establish communication
with these people our mutual anta-
gonism will end they attack like
crazy animals now but theyre ra-
tional beings differing from us only
in size they have no knowledge of
the universal spacelanguage and
no spaceradio apparently otherwise
they would surely have responded
to our frequent messages

  unprovoked attacks on venus-
began genesh

  the very presence there of earth-
men and spaceships could be regard-
ed by the mercurians as a provoca-
tion if earthmen have extended

thrills incorporated page thirteen
their frontiers to venus then may
they not attempt to subjugate mer-
cury that is their point of view

  this miserable little planet with
 a strip of habitable country only
 said genesh now venus lush and
 rich he went on with insular fer-
 vour is a planet worthy of con-
 sideration so too is your own
 earth but mercury m

  its their home planet pointed
 out rennard once we convince
 them we have no designs upon t
 they should be satisfied to live in
 peace with us and to exchange
 views to learn more about each
 other that was the idea that
 prompted your own great lingua-
 scientist baresh to devote a whole
 lifetime to the perfection of the
 linguaprojector and it was worth
 a thousand lifetimes its done more
 than spaceradio itself to weld the
 galaxy into a single peaceful whole
 yes admitted genesh but they
 must be willing to talk into and lis-
 ten to the machine

the linguaprojector was more
than a mere machine not only
did it translate the bewildering ar-
ray of languages of a dozen planets
into the universal tongue-and the
reverse also-but it preserved in-
flection and was effective in trans-
lating meanings of uncouth ono-
matopoetic sounds so that even
those inhabitants of planets low on
the evolutionary scale with only
the most rudimentary language
could make themselves reasonably
understood

   and inside the spacecraft wait-
ing for the mercurian whom the
project hoped to capture was the
linguaprojector waiting perhaps
for destruction at the hands of the
vicious little mercurians destruc-
tion of the machine and annihilation
of the members of the mercury pro-
ject   

   i think my idea was better said
  genesh we should have brought
  a fleet and attacked them and then
  tried to reason with them we may
  wait here for months they may
  never learn of our presence on this
  desolate spot

  you dont slaughter half a popu-
 lation to reason with the other half
 said rennard and they will come
 the planet is too small for us to
 remain here unnoticed for long
 sooner or later one of their craft
 will observe us

  it was sooner than even rannard
expected less than an hour later
they came

  it was the familiar form of attack
 but familiarity had not made it less
 terrifying rennard himself took
 up a position in one of the jet towers
 as soon as his wrist-radar told him
 of the approach of the mercurians
 looking through the transparent
 tower with his telescopic goggles he
 saw the craft approaching at first
 like a great string of golden beads
 glittering above the thin line of
 brilliance of the far horizon the
 huge shock-absorbing spring net had
 been automatically lifted into posi-
 tion at the first alarm and that
 coupled with the fact of mercurys
 lesser gravitational pull was a rea-
 sonable assurance that a mercuriarv
 falling from a disabled craft should
 survive

   the queer craft were streaking
across the dark sky at an almost in-
credible pace a long string of spin-
ning saucer-like craft so close to
each other that frequent collisions
seemed inevitable the great string
of craft swooped and twisted like a
crazy glowing snake and at the
same time the searing blue-white
ray issued from the mercurians
flame tubes as the ships hurtled on
their cyclonic way towards the pro-
ject

   rennard waited until those pil-
  lars of flame were almost upon his
  own tower then he barked into the
  intercom to the other towers the
  command to open fire he closed in
  his own lever and from the jet a
  sheet of blinding flame leapt out-
  wards and upwards striking the
  lower portion of the leading craft
  squarely in the centre the other
  jet towers spurted to action a split-
  second later and the leading four
  saucer-craft became at first incan-
  descent and then dripping masses
  of spinning molten metal

page fourteen thrills incorporated
in the white hot glare surround-
ing the doomed craft rennard
could distinguish the tiny figures of
the martian crews mad with the
agony of the hellish fire around
them leap from their craft quick-
ly he rapped out the order to cease
fire

 the jets subsided and the four
molten craft crashed to the ground
outside the perimeter of the pro-
ject the other craft continued on
their cyclonic flight veering away
from the towers but still maintain-
ing their string-like formation the
respite was temporary as rennard
expected with their characteristic
crazy courage the line of saucer-
craft again swooped on the project
and the second attack was more suc-
cessful one of the molten craft
crashed into a jet tower and the
scene was lit luridly by a vast wall
of flame that rose thousands of feet
into the air before the jet-extin-
guishers from the spacecraft could
come into play a second jet tower
was toppled as the white ray from
a mercurian craft burnt through its
base

 but even the meycurians retained
some sense of prudence after that
second attack the craft hurtled sky-
wards and streaked back whence
they had come leaving the glowing
wreckage of ten of their armada be-
hind them

 rennard descended from the
tower in the spring nets outside
the square formed by the towers
there were several tiny bodies but
all were still   

 no survivors asked rennard
dully as genesh came quickly to-
wards him

 two cried the venusian al-
most unharmed except for shock
theyre inside being treated now

 rennards heart leapt he ran
past the group around one of the
wrecked jet ywers and into the
spaceship followed by the lumber-
ing venusian

  two of the medical section of the
crew had brought in the mercuri-
ans one of whom was conscious
they were in the big laboratory-
cabin which housed the linguapro-
jector rennard although prepared

by telephotos of the mercurians ob-
tained during their raids on venus
was nevertheless shocked at the
sight of the mannikin standing in
the middle of the big cabin the
creature was a shade over two feet
in height dark-skinned and round-
faced that such a race could be
such a menace to the mighty venus-
earth confederation was ludicrous
and yet it was a fact a fact which
became more understandable as
rennard noted the brilliant depths
of the little mans eyes betokening
extraordinary energy and intelli-
gence this was not a member of
a decadent or an unenlightened
race the mercurian technology
as demonstrated by their incredibly
swift craft was in no sense inferior
to that of earth or venus and the
mercurian mentality was obviously
the equal of the dwellers of other
planets-at least

the mercurian moved towards
rennard and the latter blink-
ed the little mans speed of move-
ment was startling the short legs
seemed to flicker and the mans
position was changed all in the flick
of an eyelid the mercurians arm
was raised and moved several times
apparently a gesture of anger but
the movements were so rapid that
rennards eye could not follow
them

 has he sdoken yet he asked
of the two medical members

  not a sound replied one of the
officers

 oh rennard stared down at
the little man who glared up at
him a concentrated hatred in the
tiny bead-like eyes the man was
a perfect counterpart of an earth-
man-ears eyes mouth therefore
it was inconceivable that speech
was not the recognised means of
communication perhaps his vocal
chords had been injured in his fall
into the net well try the other
one said rennard hes coming
to

  the other mannikin was flinging
himself about in quick convulsive
movements on the padded table
he sat up or rather jerked up like

thrills incorporated page fifteen
a pocket-knife snapping open ren-
nard nodded and the medical offi-
cer wheeled the table across to the
linguaprojector rennard switched
on and waited for the first words
that would fall from the lips of
the mercurian

 the mannikin glared at him as
his companion had glared-with
tiny hate-filled eyes but he uttered
no sound rennard operated the
controls of the linguaprojector
while the medical officers took the
earplugs and attempted to adjust
them to the little mans skull but
the creature his eyes now fearful
moved from the table like a streak
of lightning one moment he was
sitting there the next he was over
in the far corner of the cabin tfiere
was a flicker from the other manni-
kin and then he was beside his
companion lips drawn back in a
snarl white teeth showing

  grab one of em shouted ren-
nard never mind the other
theyre like quicksilver he mut-
tered as the medical officers now
assisted by genesh attempted to
carry out the order the little men
appropriately enough were like the
metal mercury in that it seemed
impossible to place hands upon
them they simply melted away
from the quickest movements by
the earthmen and the sluggisn
movements of the venusian were
almost laughable in their ineffec-
tiveness

it was rennard himself who fin-
ally caught one of the mercurians
the little man in attempting to
escape the combined attentions of
the other three men suddenly cata-
pulted himself in rennards direc-
tion and the latters wiry arms
closed automatically around the
struggling mercurian the energy
of the creature was astounding he
seemed to be constructed of steel
springs and it required the com-
bined efforts of the two medical
officers and the great strength of
the venusian to overpower him

  good breathed rennard when
the mannikin was quelled and the
plugs forced into his ears now

perhaps well get some sense-some
of our sense-into his brain he
spoke into the machine slowly and
carefully using the space-language
and confident that the brain-cells of
the mercurian would be acted upon
in a manner that would translate
his meaning we are from earth
and venus he said clearly we
mean no harm to you on mercury
we wish to live in peace with you
all do you understand

  there was a tense silence in the
cabin all eyes turned on the little
man held tightly in the arms of
his captors the mercurians ex-
pression did not change his lips
seemed to be curiously blurred but
not a sound escaped him and not
the slightest indication that he had
heard or understood

 again rennard tried he made
adjustments to the lingua projector
and for an hour he repeated sen-
tences made plans to the mercu-
rian-utterly without result sweat
was pouring from his forehead as
desperation seized him why he
gasped turning to genesh why
i cant understand it theyre
rational theyre like us theyre
humans-virtually earthmen on a
small scale they must talk to each
other

  the inhabitants of flormesteen
in the second galaxy communicate
by means of thought-images point-
ed out genesh it is possible that
these-

  it isnt possible shouted ren-
nard those creatures you speak
of have antennae-these men have
ears to hear with they have lips
tongues they dont differ from us
except in size i tell you they must
speak and hear

  if they want to pointed out the
venusian perhaps they do not
want to perhaps hate of all exter-
nal creatures is inherent in them
they may be conditioned from
birth never to respond to reason-
ableness from an alien but-the
linguaprojector has failed for the
first time

  rennard raged around the labora-
tory cabin he was scarcely sane

page sixteen thrills incorporated
at that moment so crushing was
the disappointment he had had to
fight to work to cajole the authori-
ties of earth-venus to allow him
to undertake this project it had
been his dream his whole life-
work to end the age-long hostili-
ties between mercury and the con-
federation and he had imagined
that they could be ended for all
time by this simple direct method-
communication and resultant under-
standing

mow after all the preparation
after success in capturing two
living mercurians he had failed to
communicate with them

  calm yourself rennard said
the venusian uneasily youve
done your best-

  what does that matter shouted
rennard results-thats what i
want he glared down at the little
mercurian he bent and looked at
the mans mouth the mercurian
shrank awav his lips blurred curi-
ously rennard straightened up
suddenly and uttered a shout hes
talking he yelled his lips are
moving-moving so quickly we cant
see them look at him-look

  the mannikins mouth was still
blurred rennard pressed his hand
against the little mans lips and it
was like holding a buzzing bee in
his hand the mercurians had been
trying to communicate to them all
the time

  its their metabolism cried
rennard theyre too quick for
us everything inside them is rac-
ing their voices are above the
pitch of sound as we know it he
laughed hysterically they cant
unscramble our sounds either-too
low-pitched for them no wonder
they couldnt tune in to spaceradio
and understand it he turned
triumphantly on to genesh com-
munication he shouted thais
whats required thats what ive
always believed and im right
theres the barrier between us and
the mercurians a barrier thats in-
side each individual mercurian the
barrier of a different metabolism
just that genesh imagine it

theyre rational creatures this
madness as we called it this ap-
parently insane impulse to attack
us and keep on attacking us is sim-
ply ignorance of our motives in com-
ing so close to their planet and
ignorance can be dispelled as soon
as we reach their senses break
down the barrier of metabolism

   it can be done rennard   

  it can be done repeated ren-
nard simply done- just as simple
as radio waves can be brought down
to the level of our own hearing  

rthe work on the linguaprojector
was completed by the radio
technicians within a few hours the
mercurians listened to the trans-
formed voice of rennard and as
they listened the hate and doubt
vanished from their faces they
spoke to rennard their voices
brought down to the range of
earthmans sense of hearing and
it was as rennard had said fear
had been the impulse behind those
attacks fear of the huge creatures
that were coming so close to their
beloved little planet on which they
desired only to live in peace and
the mercurians believed that they
owed their continued existence only
to those centuries old hostilities in
keeping at bay the earth-venus
spaceships

  the mercurians had their own
radio but nothing intelligible had
ever been picked up from earth or
venus-nothing intelligible to mer-
curian ears   

  one of the captured mercurians
was speaking into the radio trans-
mitter now modiifed to cope with
the higher frequencies of the mer-
curian speech the little man was
speaking to his own people his lips 
were a blur his voice soundless to
the watching earthmen but the
words were being listened to in the
habitable belt of mercury words
that were to end the centuries old
conflict between mercury and the
confederation

  the barrier of metabolism was
down at last the madness on
mercury was ended

  ancient word for
  joke    and the
  joke is so old we are
  sure you cant have
  heard it   

t slipped my seventh martiani
very carefully the effect of
that drink is something a little more
devastating than atomic energy the
room bucked once or twice then
settled down again on more or less
an even keel i hoped the stewards
would be decent enough to put me
to bed after i passed out that could
be any time now from the way i
felt

  keeling was sitting opposite me
his face looked as blurred as he felt
wassa matter with you anyway
he screwed his eyes up as he
glanced vaguely in my direction
whas wrong with five years on
alpha centauri fine place he
giggled helplessly think of all the
spare time youll have up there-
with absolutely nothing to do he
bellowed with laughter and waved
his arms in the air hopelessly
knocking over his drink as he did
so steward he bawled gish n-
other drink

 the steward padded over and
righte the glass and refilled it from
the bottle he was holding in his
right tentacle

  very funny i said with dignity
ver funny indeed just cos space
control rot their eyes banish me

to the outer spaces for five years-
you laugh

  its all right keeling leered at
me that unit youre going to has
five men an eight women he gig-
gled violently you wont have any
spare time at all he hiccupped
violently and nearly lost his drink
again

  very funny i said again i was
looking for sympathy and i should
have known better than to come into
the space flyers club to look for
it anyway i told keeling i
wouldnt feel so bad about it if i
could have stayed home for my
birthday i looked at him sorrow-
fully with tears in my eyes my
mother bakes me a cake on my
birthday i told him solemnly a
magnificent plum cake but what
happens this time i banged myfist
down violently on the table and saw
the glass leap into the air a ten-
tacle snaked out caught the glass
and carefully returned it to the
table-the steward wasnt going to
be caught a second time this
time i said slowly i shall reach
that man-forsaken planet alpha
centauri on my birthday

  keeling slid slowly forward off
his chair onto his knees he gripped
the edge of the table with a concen-
trated effort and managed to hold
on long enough to get the last word
all you want he peered at me
doubtfully as if to see that i was
still there is something to gripe
about a wide grin spread over his
face as if he felt that he had
triumphed and could relax now his
fingers relaxed their grip on the
table-edge and he slid slowly under-
neath the table-out cold

  i thought it was a pity that some
people couldnt hold their liquor i
got to my feet and shook my head
slowly at the steward who was
offering the bottle to me i thought
it was up to me now that keeling
had passed out to show the natives

pag eighteen thrills incorporated
spoofed

    quickly os i could i climbed
down to the lost rung of the
ladder and    the box was still
just out of reach

keeling had been quite righ about
the five men and eight women

 the controller offered me a chair
which i gratefully accepted i still
had traces of the hangover from
the drinking session in the club
i think youre all set now hardy
he said your ship is in perfect
order and the lanes have been clear-
ed once you get outside martian
gravitational pull you can switch
over onto automatic and not worry
much for the next twenty days
watch out for the meteors then the
deflecor beams will throw them

a little dignity i took two paces
forward and then keeling seemed
to leap up from the floor and hit
me with his backbone

 they told me next morning that
we made quite a heap under the
table-with me on top of keeling
two days later they had my ship
ready and i went up to the con-
troller to get my final clearance the
assignment i had wasnt at all bad
really alpha centauri station one
was experimental and the work
would be extremely interesting i
was going there- and taking a small
rocket-repulsion ship with me to
act as resident pilot up there and

thrills incorporated page nineteen
off of course but its liable to be a
little bumpy

  ill watch it i said

  another thing he picked up a
box from the floor by his desk and
held it in his hands for a moment
this has to be delivered to the of-
ficer commanding on alpha cen-
tauri this is vital harh the
controller said seriously whatever
happens you must not lose this
box it contains something highly
secret and it is vital that it doesnt
fall into the wrong hands

  ill look after it i promised
good he tossed the box to-
wards me and automatically i put
out my hands to catch it

  the box floated gently out of the
controllers hands and remained
poised in the air about two feet
above his desk i shut my eyes
counted ten then opened them again
the box was still there i dont
believe it i muttered

  the controller smiled its true
that is one of the reasons why it is
so important

  i got up from my chair and gin-
gerly grasped the box there was
a slight tugging feeling as i pulled
it towards me it was most odd i
tucked the box firmly under my arm
and left the controllers office
twenty minutes later i was siting in
my ship waiting final clearance from
control

  without thinking i put the box
down on the seat beside me imme-
diately it floated uowards and re-
mained motionless above my head-

i was glad i knew i was sober i
thought the damned thing might as
well stay there i could hardly tie
it down the green lamps winked
and i let in the first boost there was
the usual split second when nothing
happened then the colossal accel-
eration and five minutes later when
i glanced out of the rear observation
window mars was a rapidly reced-
ing red ball behind me

  i readjusted the controls and set
the ship on course then switched
tver to automatic then i had no-
thing to worry about for the next

	wenty days i took another look at
ahe box it was still floating com-
fortably about a foot above my

page twenty thrills incorporated

head i thought that perhaps that
thing might start getting on my
nerves before i reached alpha cen-
tauri

  i tuned in the sonic and checked
my course with control mars they
told me i was on the beam ok and
had nothing to worry about i left
the speaker on open circuit so that
i would hear if anything came
through it would only be another
ten hours before i lost contact alto-
gether-complete silence then until
i picked up alpha centauri three
weeks later

  a couple of hours later control
came through and gave me a report
that the meteor belt was particularly
bad they had just had a report
from an ex-pluto freighter coming
in well that was the luck of he
hardys shortly after that i was
outside the range of sonicv so i
switched off and relaxed

  i had a long lone time to do no-
thing theres nothing i like better
than doing nothing

  hit the meteor belt eighteen days
    later

  the deflectors were working ok
so there was nothing to worry about
but i never can get used to seeing
thing hurtling towards you then
apparently at the last moment be-
ing diverted to one side i watched
them for a couple of hours until i
got tired of it it was certainly
thick

  it was on the nineteenth day that
it happened your brain gets a little
sluggish with nothing to do id
even got used to that damned box
floating around above my head it
happened whilst i was asleep i
woke up suddenly with the feeling
that something was wrone there
was a winking purple light on the
instrument panel-and that meant
trouble

  really it wasnt that bad-more
nuisance value than anything else
the port rocket ejection unit had
got clogged probably collected
some dust off the deflectors it meant
stopping the ship and going out to
have a look i cut the motors and
while the ship gradually slowed
down i put on a space-suit and got
the flexible-steel ladder ready
when i was all set i started the
counter propulsion motors and the
ship ultimately came to a standstill

   i was careful to check that the de-
flectors were still functioning before
i did anything else i didnt fancy
being outside the ship when a me-
teor hit it they were ok i ad-
justed the atmospheric stabilisation
unit then slid back the door of the
ship i fixed the ladder and tossed
it ait so that it hung down from
the door i had one foot on the
ladder when the second thing hap-
pened

  the stabilisation unit must have
been fractionally out the atmos-
phere inside the ship slightly lower
than that outside the difference
was enough as i put my other foot
on a lower rung that blasted box
floated serenly past my head and
out into space

  i made a frantic grab at it and
missed the box floated on down
past my feet and came to rest about
two feet away from the bottom of
the ladder

  as quickly as i could i climbed
down to the last rung of the ladder
and reached for the box it was
just out of reach i hung onto the
ladder with one hand and foot and
reached again my grasping fingers
were only six inches away from the
damned thing i made a supreme
effort and that was my undoing

  my weight acted on the ladder
and it slowly swung away fromme

i grasped nothing desperately and
then lost my balance the ladder
swung out of my grasp and i float-
ed away from it a couple of fec-t
collecting the box as i went past
then the momentum was dead and
i came to a stop about four feet
away from the ladder and ten feet
away from the ship

  i could feel the sweaf pouring
down my face inside the space-hel-
met i was living a space-flyers
nightmare tas far as i was concern-
ed i might just as well have been a
million miles away from the ladder
and the ship there was no way
in which i could get back

  i looked at the box in my hand
and swore steadily for ten minutes
without i think repeating myself

but that wasnt going to help me i
ultimately realised so i shut up and
tried to think

  i had enough oxygen in my hel-
met to last for six hours after that
i was finished doomed to die of
asphyxiation with the ship and
safety only a few feet away i
waved my arms and legs desperate-
ly but of course it didnt make any
difference-i remained exactly
where i was

jhe time moved slowly very
slowly it must have been over
an hour before i saw the faint blue
light coming towards the ship at an
incredible speed a meteor i
thought that i wouldnt have to wait
for the oxygen to give out-the me-
teor was coming straight towards
me then i remembered i had left
the deflectors working so that there
wasnt a chance of the meteor com-
ing near me

  sure enough when it was near
growing bigger with every split sec-
ond it suddenly whirled to one side
and went screaming off at a tan-
gent

  a moment later i was spun round
upside down and for a few seconds
i couldnt work out what had hap-
pened when i collected my sense
enough to look around-which isnt
easy when youre upside down-i
realised that the ship was directly
beneath me the speed and move-
ment of the meteor had caused an
eddy current which had caught me
it seemed a logical supposition we
know that space is not nothing-
otherwise light rays and space ships
couldnt move through it so a mov-
ing body through space must set
up a slight resistance with that
thought i began to hope again if
enough meteors came along there
was a faint chance that i might be
deflected near enough to the ship to
be able to get aboard once more if
i did the rocket ejection unit could
take care of itself until i reached
aloha centauri

  sure enough a few seconds later
another meteor appeared i watched
carefully and as the eddy caught me

i yelled excitedly as i saw i was
heading straight for the ship but
continued on page

toid to one company a wrong idea

tall and lean with a rather cynical
cast of countenance and his years of
travel and experience as a free-
lance spacefreighter before he sign-

   which took its toll

allow free access to their rich little
planetoid why

  always the same sighed bill
birston ive never known anyone
to search for the dark lining like
you do barry the jago corpora-
tion are quite within their rights
they hold the lease for another
ninety-six years and its natural that
they shouldnt allow others to poke
about and learn the processes their
scientists have perfected in he
four years theyve been exploiting
this planetoid theyve achieved mir-
acles of production we on earth
should be thankful that such a go-
ahead corporation exists otherwise
wed be starved for some of the rare
minerals and the spacefuel that are
being produced and processed here
in such quantities

  i always distrust super-effici-
ency commented barry ronald
it suggests a form of slavery

  bill bristdn laughed uproariously
youre a few thousand years be-
hind the times barry didnt some-
one break the news to you that ma-
chines work for humans now
barry looked down on the magni-
ficient spaceport at the web of ele-
vated roadways spreading smoothly

out to all parts of the only city on
the planetoid jago city he saw
the splendid buildings built of the
peculiar white translucent stone
quarried on the planetoid rising in
great tiers around the vast space-
port and his mind switched back
thousands of years to the great
pyramids on earth   yes perhaps
he was living in the past but all
the same as long as huge works
were created human hands and hu-
man brains would have to toil in
their creation and jago city had
been just too spectacular in its rise
and the jago corporation had amass-
ed enormous almost unbelievrble
wealth in a few short years and the
planetoid itself was closed to all
who did not possess a special pass
issued by the company the fact
that there existed only one space-
port and that the uncleared portion
of that little world was a sodden
seamy swampland and flint-like in-
hospitable rocky country made it
virtually impossible for unauthoris-
ed spacecraft to land

  but it was his knowledge of the
heed of jago corporation that had
caused his suspicions to become con-
victions

 yes im distrustful of most
things bill said barry slowly
and im not happy at the thought
that jakob stenner is the big boss
of the corporation hes been mixed
up in a lot of queer deals he was
exploiting the venus fields until the
venusian welfare officers made
things too hot for him had jago
been populated by an indigenous
race earth government would
never have allowed him the charter
it was only because earthmen were
freely recruited to colonize the

place and to return within a month
before signing a years contract if
they desired that stenner was given
the opportunity

  couldnt have given it to a better
man insisted bill hes ruthless
in lots of ways but he gets things
done he pointed down to the
spaceport look at em theyre ali
smart active and willing workers
well-disciplined well-trained and
certainly well-fed the officers of
the spaceport in their trim tight-fit-
ting uniforms flowing cloaks and
helmets glittering in the late after-
noon sunshine from alpha centuris
all heightened the impression of a
well run colony one of them the
port controller boarded the space-
craft and bill briston left the ob-
servation port to meet him at the
airlock the spacecrafts papers
were handed to bill and the craft
was ready to leave as usual on the
tick of time

  efficiency remarked bill if all
our customers were like the jago
crowd wed never be an hour behind
in the three months journey to
earth well be home right on sche-
dule

ptve hours out from jago how-
ever an incident occurred which
shattered this confident prediction
both barry and bill were in the
control room when the chief engin-
er  entered and reported a stow-
away

  a stowaway bill gasped from
jago

  not so efficient at the spaceport
after all murmured barry with a
faint grin bring him in here

  its a-a she sir said the en-
gineer and a moment later he
ushered the girl into the control
room she was small and fair and
lithe and under the brilliant lights
in the room her hair glinted like
spun gold her skin was flawless
but there was a faint line etched in
her otherwise smooth forehead a
heavy weariness in the blue eyes
that hinted of past worry and sor-
row she was clad in the usual briefs
and cloak worn by the dwellers on
the humid little planet of moist
warm days and chilly nights

   well young lady said bill after
the engineer had closed the door
behind him whats the idea-and
how did you manage to escape the
vigilance of the port officials

  she answered the second question
first speaking in an assured voice
i took the place of some cargo i
hid in the clearing house last night
why and who are you any-
way

  i am greta maybury elec-
tronics expert and this was the
only way i could get back to earth
were prisoners there on jago

  bill gasped looked at barry
whose face wore a grin which plain-
ly said i told you so

  you cant expect us to believe
that fifty-odd thousand humans are
prisoners back there

  there are more than that and
they are prisoners if they cant re-
turn to earth if they arent allow-
ed to communicate with earth if
they work at whatever task tffey are
given and wihout any choice if
every move they make is under an
electronic-eye system-are they pri-
soners or free workers

  but the men at the spaceport-
they are a different class put
in the girl you dont understand
ive been there for three years and
ive seen everything that has hap-
pened in that time jakob stenner
organised the whole thing as a
slave-world from the start he per-
suaded thousands of technicians
scientists engineers-the most bril-
liant men he could find-to come to
this grand new world they thought
there would be vast opportunities
and all we have done is build a pri-
son for ourselves there are thou-
sands of others military men now
who were of a different type and
they work directly under jakob
stenner and keep the rest of us
under control she laughed bitterly
the scientific and technical staff
work like automatins blindly obed-
ient hopeless there is only one
spaceradio station on the planet and
that is controlled by the corporation
the technicians are watched too
closely by the electronic eye to have
a chance to build a station and com-
municate with earth and reveal true

page twenty-four thrills incorporated
conditions on jago we eat and
sleep under the eye we have set
hours for entertainment reading
teletheatre open-air exercise -
everything is perfectly arranged
we are well-fed well-clothed at-
tended regularly by the corpora-
tions medical officers-but were
slaves and were all waiting for
the chance to grasp freedom again

  bill looked from the girl to his
lieutenant her story carried con-
viction and was an almost uncanny
substantiation of what barry had
said-efficiency plus slavery even
if it was slavery brought up to date

  but there must have been some
protests some revolt against such
an organization

  there was about a year ago it
showed us how ruthless stenner
was it showed us-the pugo jug-
gernaut

  the what

  the perfect weapon for crushing
any revolt a creation of some of
stenners top scientists and engin-
eers it is an irresistible atomic-
driven fortress a huge and horrible
thing bristling with guns and tubes
of all sorts atoflame throwers
atomic charges paralysing gases
when the crowds tried to storm the
corporations headquarters and take
stenner himself prisoner this ter-
rible thing of which we knew no-
thing up till then was turned loose
against us incineiating hundreds
and crushing the life out of hun-
dreds more under the tractors of
the moving fortress

  stenner was pleased at the effi-
ciency of his great anti-revolution
machine and in a local broadcast he
referred to it as his juggernaut and
warned us that it was standing by
always ready to leap into action at
a moments notice just a mention
of it now is sufficient to make any-
one with ideas of defiance think
twice t

dills jaw set in a hard line

     stenners had his day he said
well take you to the director of
spacecolonies as soon as we get
back to earth and-

  and then therell be the usual
delay put in the girl i know all

about tt its going to take us three
months to get bacfc to earth and
then my stor-v vvl be examined
closely and ill bt cross-examined to
make sure that it isnt just an exag-
geration by an hysterical girl it will
be at least sever or eight months
before any action is taken on jago
and in the meantime my absence
will be discovered and stenner will
have ample tim to prepare for a
visit from a committee of inquiry
from earth hes a clever and cun-
ning man and i know hell have
some means of putting up a front to
receive an official committee he
may use drugs on some of his work-
ers-i dont kno what his methods
will be but hell have some plan
of that nature rerdy the only way
to turn jago into a decent world is
to stage a successful revolt

  but how- 

  theres just one way said the
girl calmly get control of the jug-
gernaut

  the two spacepilots gasped and
then in barry rolands dark eyes
there appeared a gleam of anticipa-
tion and recklessness it was the
sort of undertaking that appealed to
him a splendid break from the dull
monotony of carting supplies back
and forth across limitless space a
tame occupation for one who had
spent his early years as spacepilot
seeking out new worlds and prob-
ing beyond the known limits of
space

  bill briston looked in surprise at
the transformed face of his co-pilot
he had thought barry could never
recover his pristine enthusiasm but
the others expression was now that
of a youngster promised a treat his
dark face was irradiated by a huge
grin his voice excited just the
thing he said turn stenners
monster against its creator in the
old frankenstein tradition

  greta maybury looked u at the
tall lieutenant in astonishment she
had not expected such a wholeheart-
ed response to her tentative sugges-
tion it will be terribly risky she
said but ive learnt a little from
one of the spaceport officials she
coloured slightly i-i had to pre-
tend that i was a keen admirer of

thrills incorporated page twenty-fiv
         and the official a young
man got the idea that i was in love
with him-

  but youre not put in barry

  of course not it was the only
way i could obtain a little freedom
if it hadnt been for that i should
never have been able to stay around
the spaceport and i shouldnt have
been able to escape on to ypur craft
ive found out a few things includ-
ing the location of the juggernaut
you have atomic weapons on board
and if you could surprise the guards
who will be unprepared for such an
audacious move and take over the
juggernaut you will be actually
taking over jago

  a full scale civil war breathed
bill briston in an awed voice
therell be hell to pay with space-
colonies

  rot snapped barry well have
the testimony of thousands of sten-
ners ex-slaves    forget that
part of it he turned to greta may-
bury- is there anywhere that you
know of where we could land apart
from the spaceport of course

  she frowned its desolate coun-
try on the far side of the planetoid
and of course you would have to
land at night there are constant
aircar patrols covering the plane-
toid at all times so you wouldnt be
able to use landing lights im afraid
youd just have to land blindly and
risk smashing your craft its a ter-
rible risk to ask you to take i
know but theres no other way out
of it

  we can cushion our landing with
jets said barry with quick optim-
ism  even if we smash our craft
it wont make any difference pro-
vided we dont smash ourselves as
well because if we win out well
have all the jago spacecraft at our
disposal and if we dont   he
shrugged well our own craft
wouldnt be of any use to us any-
way he looked across at his com-
manders worried face whats it
to be bill are you in it

  i have a duty to spacefreight
limited barry- he began

  you have a duty to tens of thou-
sands of fellow-humans put in
barry his voice chilly

  bill flushed ah right but the
crew-

  ill talk em round said bajry
hastily leave them to me its up
to you

  for a moment bill briston eyed
the pleading anxious face of gieta
maybury then without a word he
moved to the control panel the
steady glowing spheres of distant
planets on the visiscreen began to
move across the screen and other
space bodies took their place as the
space eagle swung in a huge circle
on its way back to jago

  

the night landing on jago was an
experience that barry would
never forget he and bill had decid-
ed that the craft would have to
risk a crash and that the auxiliary
aircar would be used to carry them
across the planetoid to the spot
where the juggernaut was housed
the space eagle was brought to a
hovering standstill thousands of
miles out in space its nose directed
toward the tiny planetoid ready for
the moment when it would hurl it-
self like a projectile at its objective
-and that moment would be judged
according to the movements of the
airpatrol cars that kept their un-
ceasing vigil around the prison
planetoid

  barry sat watching the visiscreen
watching the movements of the
streaking aircars and calculating
the few minutes the space eagle
would have to effect a landing be-
tween patrols the crew were order-
ed into shock harness and at the
right moment the spacecraft sud-
denly became a hurtling comet
streaking madly through space as
thought intent on smashing itself to
atoms against the globular target
which grew on the visiscreen at an
alarming rate

 both the commander and his
lieutenant were at the dual con-
trols acting in perfect unison the
one ready to take over in the event
of a blackout overcoming the other
with the surface of the planetoid
filling the visiscreen barry threw in
the jet brakes he blacked out re-
covered as the craft a screaming
living thing tore straight towards

page twenty-six thrills incorporated
the planetoids surface every mem-
ber of the great spacecraft vibrat-
ing madly and protesting against the
terrific stresses barry had a fleet-
ing vision of jagged rocks below in
the wan moonlight from the three
distant moons bill briston had
slumped forward in his harness his
nerveless hands still clutching the
controls barry swung the craft in
an almost impossible small circle to
avoid its reaching the other side of
the planetoid in its headlong flight
the vibration became worse and it
was coupled with ominous creak-
ings no craft ever built had been
designed to withstand such crazy
manoeuvres it tore across a rocky
gorge but the deceleration was ob-
vious now lower and lower the
craft circled over the inhospitable
ground barry saw a patch of stunt-
ed trees and scrub and widened the
circle to include the vegetation
then he set the machine straight into
the patch

  for a matter of a minute or so
the slowly moving craft seemed to
hover under the braking jets then
it tore through the low timber
smashing and burning its way for a
half-mile its interior resounding to
the tearing impact and then it
stopped rolled and pitched to a
drunken angle and barry ronald
pitched forward in his harness and
hung limply his nerves resting at
last in black unconsciousness

  bill bristons face
barrys vision 

manders voice was urgent and
barry was aware of the heat within
the craft he nodded climbed out
of his harness and left the control
room in the observation room they
found greta maybury unconscious
barry lifted her from her harness
and made for the airlock he step-
ped out on to a heap of smouldering
slag from the smashed port jet
from a great rent in the skin of the
craft further aft the engineer ap-
peared in the ufoite moonlight fol-
lowed by the two other members of
the crew one of whom had the first-
aid kit greta responded to a hypo
injection and was able to stand
and almost immediately she was her
brisk efficient self again

   she surveyed the terrain then the
sky were roughly fifty miles east
of jago city i should say she re-
marked i know the landmarks
well that chain of mountains is
thirty miles west of the citys out-
skirts she looked quickly at the
spacecraft the aft portion of which
w-as glowing redly the auxiliary
aircar you cant get it out now
the hatch is well forward cor-
rected bill well manage it the
armory is there too and we dont
want a spectacular explosion either
which we will get if the heat reaches
that before we clear it he rapped
out orders and the crew moved
quickly to the forward hatch with
its emergency equipment and am-
munition greta insisted on help-
ing carrying blasters and ammuni-
tion and storing them in the rear of
the aircar after the little craft was
brought from the hatch

-jhey were almost ready to depart
when a high-pitched whine
caused them to look upwards
against the night sky glimmering
palely in the moonlight was visible
one of the jago patrol aircars its
shark-like fins and spearhead nose
giving it a curiously threatening ap-
pearance the craft swooped down
its pilot obviously attracted by the
red glow from the wrecked space-
craft

belly of the patrol car starkly sil-
houetting the tense group fire
and the six atoblasters spat forth
their lethal charges as one with
cataclysmic violence the patrol car
exploded in a blue-white blaze
vaporised in a boiling cloud that
rolled and spread in a great sheet
of radiance

 team work remarked greta
calmly a bit more of that and
stenner will be looking for another
planetoid to start a new slave or-
ganization

  barry stared at her the girls
calmness and brittle manner was not
only astonishing but somehow un-
unpleasant for once in his life the
spacepilot found himself really at-

blasters ready rapped the com-
swam into mander even as he spoke a blind-

tracted by a girl and it was ironical
that she should be one who in her
manner and outlook appeared to be
more masculine than feminine in
spite of her appearance of soft
beauty

  bill briston led the way into the
aircar and a few moments later the
little craft was climbing the jug-
gernaut said greta sitting close
behind bill at the controls is hous-
ed somewhere in the mountains its
in the south-west spur that was all
i could discover if you bring the
car down on a plateau that faces the
town-see just below-well recon-
noitre from there

  bill nodded there was another
patrol car visible in the sky to the
east it would be foolhardy to risk
an engagement with the jago craft
in view of the city the lights of
which glowed brilliantly against the
surrounding blackness he caused
the little craft to dip skimming
over the rocky mass below he risk-
ed a flash of the landing lights and
sighted the comparative flatness of
the plateau and presently the craft
slid to a standstill

  greta automatically assumed com-
mand and such was her personality
that neither the commander nor his
lieutenant disputed her orders al-
though barry was conscious of in-
tense irritation at her peculiar effi-
ciency under her directions the
party fanned out climbing down the
rugged sides from the plateau
searching for the wide tell-tale
track which the juggernaut must
have made through the scrub-cover-
ed ground at the base of the moun-
tain ridge she moved off alone and
barry watched her go with some
misgivings in spite of her complete
assurance he was reluctant to see
her go alone if she encountered
one of the guards  he hesitated
only a few moments then he fol-
lowed her after all she was the
one most familiar with the terrain
and she was more likely to find the
juggernauts hiding place than any-
one else

  she moved with the lithe speed of
a sure-footed cat over the rough
flinty rocks so that the lieutenant
had difficulty in keeping her in

sight several times she disappeared
from his view behind clumps of
rock and it was after she had pass-
ed around one of these clumps that
he lost sight of her completely

lie stared around at the forbid-
ding rocky desolation and as he
started to move ahead he heard a
faint choking cry so close to him
that he jumped the cry came from
the direction of a jagged heap of
rocks straight ahead he moved for-
ward quickly the cafety-switch on
his blaster released

  who is he tie stopped as the
masculine voice asked the question
come on little one tell me his
name this lover of yours

  i wont it was gretas voice
and youll never find out

  you must be madly in love with
each other for you to risk coming
out here said the man and he
must be crazy to tell you where to
come

  its our only chance of meeting
said greta you know tljat stenner
will not allow any love affairs be-
tween female technicians and his
soldiers her voice became soft and
caressing but im built that way
that i must have someone to love
me and i fell in love with this
guard and he feels the same about
me

  the man laughed sure you
couldnt fall in love with another
guard little one

  maybe i could gretas voice
took on an intimate softness

  barry heard a faint scuffling
sound she was playing a part with
this guard but it didnt make it any
easier to listen to he stepped for-
ward and moved cautiously around
the rocks under the moonlight he
saw a cloaked and helmeted guard
standing with his arms around
greta the two locked in a tight em-
brace the guards face was towards
barry and as the man lifted his face
from gretas he saw barry stand-
ing immobile

  the man uttered a gulp of amaze-
ment which changed quickly to a
snarl of rage at the realisation of
how he had been tricked he groped
for his atopistol at the same time

page twenty-eight thrills incorporated
ctutching at gretas wrist and
swinging her around in front of him
as a shield barry lowered his
blaster he could not blast this man
without killing greta but the guard
could finish him off within the next
few seconds

  with fascinated eyes barry saw
the dull gleam of the atopistol in
the mans hand he waited for the
charge helpless then the man
spoke i dont know what crazy idea
you two had to come here he rasp-
ed but were going to find out
youre planning another revolution
eh

  barry remained silent all right
the guard jerked his helmeted head
towards a black opening in the
rocks behind him in there youll
talk a lot he turned to greta as
for you you lying little- he got
no farther greta suddenly bent her
slim young body at the same time
grasping his wrist with her free
hand barry had a glimpse of the
guard a whirling mass of flying
cloak and gleaming helmet being
tossed over gretas bent back and
then the mans body flew over the
cliffside thudding sickeningly as it
struck the jagged rocks below

  you almost ruined things said
greta calmly

  i-i couldnt bear to see that big
brute kissing you- began barry

  dont be silly she said a
means to an end this is one of the
entrances she added go and
round up the others and bring them
here ill do some preliminary ex-
ploring

  no you wont-not alone said
barry and there was that in his tone
that held back the hot retort on her
lips -

  very well she said shortly
well go together but well have to
come back for them in any case
when we see the layout inside we
can formulate a plan of action

  she went into the black hole first
the tunnel was surprisinglv short
little more than a lobby brilliant
light came from a bend a few yards
from the entrance and rounding the
bend they found themselves on a
raised ledge overlooking an enor-

mous cavern gouged out of tfie

mountain

garry stared down at the scene
below gretas description of
the juggernaut had prepared him
for something of a mechanical
marvel but the sight of the thing
took his breath away it was fully
 feet long and fifty feet high and
above that height again was a huge
circular transparent dome the
monstrous machine was of a dully
gleaming golden colour its nose a
huge bulge from which projected
blaster tubes and a slit which the
girl told him was used to expel
gases gave the thing a peculiarly
animal appearance the sheathed
tractors extended the full length of
the juggernaut and between them
like a cowcatcher was a long metal
member operated by jointed arms

 there were several small build-
ings within the cavern and a smaller
box-like structure from which radi-
ated masses of cables evidently the
controlling mechanism for the vast
rock door through which the jug-
gernaut wouldemerge there was a
solitary soldier in that great cav-
ern sitting on a metal chair in the
shadow of the machine

  therell never be a better oppor-
tunity said barry softly well get
this thing single-handed greta
she nodded and barry led the way
down a flight of steps towards the
dozing soldier

 dont move and dont make a
sound barry uttered the command
in a low tense voice the soldier
uttered a faint gasp turned and
found himself looking into the dead-
ly barrel of a blaster

 who- he began but was silenc-
ed bv a gesture from barry

 no questions get up and keep
your hands in the air   thats
right now into the juggernaut   
not a word or youll be an atomic
cloud the man reading death in
the cold eyes of the space-pilot
turned obediently and walked down
the length of the metal monster he
stopped half-way where a flight of
steps which were the inner side of
an open door led up into the con-
trol room of the juggernaut barry

thrills incorporated page twenty-nine
nd the girl followed him inside
the dome was a mass of controlling
levers at first bewildering but to
the highly trained space-pilot they
offered only a brief problem keep-
ing the soldier under the blaster
barry questioned him about some
of the controls and the man ans-
wered sullenly

  thanks said barry shortly he
frowned at the sufden look of
triumph on the mans face and at
the same instant greta uttered a
cry

  when you walked in here grin-
ned the man you set off an alarm
no one is allowed to walk into the
juggernaut during the night-not
even i

  the cavern had become alive with
soldiers soldiers were issuing from
the buildings and from other doors
in the rocks half-clad unhelmeted
but all carrying blasters barry
leapt to the switchboard his hand
groping for the door control but the
soldier leapt at the same time his
gloved fist caught the spacepilot on
the jaw sending him sprawling
against greta the blaster fell from
his hand he made a wild grab at
it as he lay on the floor but a heav-
ily-booted foot crushed down on his
wrist and the next moment the sol-
diers were pouring into the control
dome

  a spacepilot eh barry yanked
to his feet faced the half-clad sol-
dier evidently the commander of
the guards another revolt led by
a pilot from earth the man step-
ped closer how did you get here
what is your ship how many are
there with you

  im saying nothing snapped
barry but your rotten regime is
finished here he bluffed soon all
earth will know the conditions on
this planetoid

  the commander operated a radio
transmitter barracks all troops
alert take up revolt stations he
repeated the message then altered
the wavelength calling mr sten-
ners chief secretary    he spoke
at some length in a low voice into
the transmitter listened for a mo-
ment then shut off youre to re-
main here mr stenner is coming to

see you personally

  barry saw gretas face turn ashen
at the sound of the mans name all
her brittle confidence seemed to de-
sert her they were standing side
by side and his hands sought hers
and she responded by squeezing his
hand tightly

comething of gretas awe com-
municated itself to barry when
in a surprisingly short space of time
jakob stenner strode into the con-
trol dome barry felt a thrill at the
first sight of this legendary figure
a thrill of revulsion tinged with re-
spect stenner was small stunted
with an enormous bald head and
deep-set green eyes he was clad
sombrely in dark well-cut briefs
and a black cloak with him was his
chief secretary a tall hawk-faced
man

  youve done well to get this far
was stenners surprising comment
you can do better for yourself i
admire men of initiative im offer-
ing you work with me

im not-	

  you two are holding hands went
on stenner smilingly as an induce-
ment to you i shall waive my rule
that my staff may not marry there
is a romantic attachment between
you two interested

  not in your proposition said
barry

  i dont make an offer twice
think carefully

  a soldier entered the dome and
saluted the commander an air car
has been located sir three space-
fliers have been found members of
a spacefreight crew all have been
destroyed

  greta uttered a gasp and gripped
barrys hand tighter

  hopeless you see said stenner
barry was not listening his thoughts
were bitter there were two sol-
diers at the entrance to the dome
the commander stenner and the
secretary just a few men to prevent
his gaining control of the jugger-
naut and with it virtual control of
this planetoid hed reached the very
brink of success and was halted
abruptly at the last moment the
crew were dead bill briston ap-

page thirty thrills incorporated
parently he had eluded capture so
far but it could only be a matter of
time

  i want your answer now sten-
ner broke in on his thoughts

  barry hesitated ft he could play
for time -then he and the others
spun round sharply to stare through
the dome as a series of explosions
suddenly split the silence echoing
again and again through the vast
cavern its bill he yelled and
bill briston it was he was standing
on the little platform by which
barry had entered the cavern a
blaster in his hand spitting death
and devastation on the massed sol-
diers below as he watched the
space commander ducked back into
the tunnel and the soldiers respond-
ed with a burst of atomic fire that
split and melted the rock then bill
reappeared again his back to them
and with a sickening feeling of de-
spair barry realised that his com-
mander was caught between two
fires that soldiers were attacking
him from the tunnel as well

  he saw bill turn sharplv and dis-
charge his blaster into the cavern
and the next instant bill briston
vanished in a boiling atomic cloud

 stenner chuckled as he peered
through the glastic dome i told
you it was hopeless-

  barry leapt leapt straight at the
dwarfish figure and grasped stenner
around the waist with one arm and
gripped his neck with his free hand
he backed towards the control
panel using stenners writhing body
as a shield the soldiers their blas-
ters raised moved towards him

  back roared barry tell em to
get back stenner or by hell ill
throttle you tell em to get out all
of them

  gasping as the grip on his throat
slackened stenner gave the order
the soldiers backed out the com-
mander after a helpless stare at
stenner followed them but the sec-
retary made no move

  you too snapped barry greta
operate that door-control the red
button as soon as theyre clear
the secretary moved slowly to-
wards the door through the glas-
tic barry saw the soldiers and the

commander on the steps hurry
you he urged

  the secretarys response was a
tigerish leap at greta the girl ut-
tered a cry and involuntarily stab-
bed at the red button and then she
crashed to the floor under the weight
of the tall secretary the man leapt
tc his feet at once and from beneath
his cloak he whipped out a tiny ato-
fiame pistol with every ounce of
strength in his sinewy body barry
hurled the slight body of stenner at
the secretary then he rushed to
the control board closed the main
switch the huge machine vibrated
to life the vibrations increasing as
relay after relay closed automatic-
ally there was a rending crash
muffled within the machine but
like a distant avalanche as the jug-
gernaut crashed through the rock
door and began racing irresistibly
across the rugged ground its speed
increasing at every moment

 within the control dome barry had
a glimpse of the dawn sky above
and fleeting countryside below as he
hurled himself at stenner and the
secretary the latters pistol had
shot from his hand but barry had
no time to look for it the tall man
twisting clear of stenner was on his
feet and as barry rushed him he
shot out his foot aod pain ripped
through the spaceflier as the vicious
kick caught him in the stomach he
dropped to the floor but greta flung
herself like a tigress at the tall sec-
retary the man uttered a shrill cry
as she caught his wrist and twisted
it at the same time bending her
lithe young body sharply the sec-
retary hurtled across her back and
crashed against the glastic slid to
the floor where he lay unconscious
blood seeping from his split head

  the juggernaut was hurtling
alone at terrific speed through the
glastic dome barry saw massive
buildings flying past as the vast ma-
chine thundered into the city itself
masses of soldiers alerted and at
their revolt stations broke and fled
as the crazy machine tore amongst
them crushing them to rags and
red pulp there came a jarring im-
pact as the juggernaut cut through
a great building like a knife

thrills incorporated page thirty-one
through butter and masonry crash-
ed around the machine

                                          

  barry laughed crazily this was
the ultimate adventure of an adven-
turous career you lunatic it was
stenner who spoke his green eyes
blazing fear in his face he stared
up and barry saw vicious pointed-
nosed airfighters converging on the
machine the nearest airfighter sent
out a blinding jet of fire which nar-
rowly missed the only vulnerable
part of the juggernaut the glastic
dome with a startled oath stenner
sprang to the gun-control panel and
a moment later the airfighter was
split through the middle by a blast
from the gun

 they dont know youre still
alive stenner said barry youd
better broadcast to the city call on
your men to surrender call on
your slave-workers to take over all
arms its that or ill wipe the city
out and ill finish you off first

  and if i do snapped stenner

what happens to me

   to save loss of life ill guarantee
your freedom you can take a space-
craft and a crew-and the universe
is a big place

  stenner stood irresolute for a mo-
ment then he nodded yes he said
philosophically tha universe is a
big place  he moved over to the
broadcasting unit and spoke    
  

  with the juggernaut at rest among
the ruins it had created barry and
greta stood in the dome watching
the spaceship until it became at one
with the black vastness of space
the last of stenner i hope he
said ruthless but you cant help
admiring him in a way you know
greta stenner is about the last per-
son i should have imagined as
cupid but he did just that little job
for us-or did he

  gretas reply was to move into
barrys arms

rocketeers at bay contd

equipment behind them they co-
vered the ground in great leaps in
the slight gravity but they were
only halfway there before another
sound sent them round in aghast
horror it was the roar of explod-
ing atomic reaction engines-the en-
gines of the starshell

  what     someone said

  lord knows jackson retorted
sharply whatever it is they are
fighting inside it has somehow man-
aged to blow up the ship to stop us
getting away

  in the building they also heard
the explosion but it did not regis-
ter on them they were too busy
trying to stay alive a hopeless
battle blaster after blaster was
failing now and the green cloud was
closing in they knew it was alive
now there was something like a
greedy anticipation in the air

  man after man choked and fell to
the floor writhing under the stuff

there was no defence for a short
while the blasters could keep it
back but it had some way of put-
ting the weapons out of commission
could it do that to all weapons
a cold chill gripped them even in
their agony as they thought of the
green terror overrunning a whole
world that had no defence

 then something happened the
mist writhed and they could almost
sense its baulked fury and fear
something had come into the build-
ing to frighten the green mist some-
thing invisible to them but tangible
to the mist

   	 
yaylan saw with his mind the
battle on the asteroid the new
civilisation called  ceres and with
anger noted the men writhing on
the floor under their ancient enemy
the media he sent his thought on

page thirty-two thrills incorporated
wij heard the media speak among
themselves

  these descendants of the old ones
are puny creatures with no know-
ledge of the minds power

  their world will be easy to take
when the old ones destroyed our
planet they also destroyed their
race they died but we still live

  they did not all die the green
cloud writhed as the thought of
vaylan pierced into it you are
weak after your long sleep he con-
tinued i gained strength as i slept
and now i shall destroy you

tvtallory came to with the rest
of his men on station zst-d
on the asteroid juna the whole
place was agog nobody knew how
they had got there somebody open-
ed the commonroom door-and there
were the-crew of the starshell scat-
tered about the floor and furniture
-with no more knowledge of how
they had arrived than their sur-
prised hosts

  the last think i remember is the
green was writhing away and or-
dering everyone outside mallory
said bewilderedly

  the station captain shook his head
there has been something going
on at ceres that i do not understand
come with me to the communica-
tions room and ill show you when
they had both reached that room
he slipped a cube recording into a
player-screen we had been watch-
ing ceres ever since you landed and
this recording was taken

  in amazed disbelief mallory look-
ed into the screen and saw himself
and his men run from the building-
then a great twisting flaming thing
of force come into being in the sky
it descended nearer and nearer to
the building and the screen went
blank in a brilliant burst of light

  what was it he asked blankly

  the captain shook his head i

think that is something we shall

never know nor how you got here
from your report you fought an un-
known force on ceres and something
helped you-transporting you here
when your ship was destroyed

 mallory swayed slightly what
had the green stuff been and what
had frightened it powerful forces
had been at work on ceres forces
they knew nothing of it would be
a long time before they understood
-if ever

vfaylan kept the media chained
with his thought as the great
flaming snake of force he had
brought into being descended then
as the struggles of the captive things
ended he relaxed and let his thought
join his body back on earth

  the media are no more master
the robot zandlor said do you go
aboveground to greet your descen-
dants now

  no zantlor vaylan said softly
they are not yet ready and would
not understand they must have
their mechanical civilisation before
they can begin to delve into and ap-
preciate the far greater powers of
the mind

 the robot watched the man lay
down again in the crystal casket
it has been so long without you
master it said pleadingly

  vaylan smiled patience my good
friend it will not be for long now
they learn quickly soon they will
be ready for the knowledge we can
bring them

  there was the quiet thought of
goodbye from the robot and the
panel closed over the pearly eye of
the faithful little metal creature that
stood in front of the great electronic
brain the air hissed out of the
room as the copper lever swung
back to its former position and cur-
rent flamed in great arcs about the
crystal coffin of the man who lay
sleeping until the descendants of his
lost civilisation should be ready for
him

id forgotten the	-i was

just another moving boay to them
just as i was nearing the ship a
violent eddy caught me and sent me
spinning to one side-i had been
deflected

  and so it went on for a couple of
hours  was buffetted about from
one side to the other of the ship but
never near enough to grab hold of
it

 when i had given up all hope
and was soberly thinking that there
couldnt be a sillier way of dying
a freak happened that saved my
life two meteors came at the ship
almost simultaneously the first
eddy took me over the ship so that
i was once more behind it and the
second meteor being diverted in the
opposite direction sent me forward
again towards the rear of the ship
the deflectors only acted forward
from the ship so i drifted in easily
toward the ladder and managed to
catch hold of the bottom rung with
one hand

  i sobbed with relief as i climbed
through the doorway and pulled the
ladder in after me my head was
beginning to feel fuzzy and i realis-
ed that the oxygen was giving out
as quickly as i could i shut the
door and sealed it then let the box
go and it floated back towards its
original place as if nothing had
happened i adjusted the stabilisa-
tion unit and managed to get the
helmet off as the oxygen gave out
entirely

  i didnt worry about the rocket
ejection unit it made my progress
a little slower but i wasnt worrying
about that i had no intention of
venturing outside the ship again un-
til i had safely delivered the box

 i was given a warm welcome
when i reached alpha centauri-
especially by the women first
thing after i landed i went to the
controller and handed him the box

here i said take it quickly
its caused me enough trouble al-
ready

  he raised his eyebrows what is
it he asked

  dont tell me you dont know
i yelled he shook his head with a
puzzled frown i couldnt stand it
any longer i opened the box as
quickly as i could when the pack-
ing and wrappings finally came off
there stood revealed on the table in
all its pristine glory-a plum cake

  there was a small white card in-
side which said happy birthday
hope you dont feel lonely now-
keeling

 the controller frowned at me
really hardy he said tartly i
hope you dont usually use that
sort of language

    couple of years later keeling
came in on one of the freighter
units that came up every six months
terra reckoning he screamed
with laughter when i told him the
story of the box-the cretin i re-
membered our conversation in the
club he said i had one of the
martians bake the cake and the
controller agreed to give you the
box and spin the story that it was
something extremely valuable

  one thing you might tell me i
said patiently how the hell did
you get it to float

  well old boy he looked at me
solemnly you know the hallmark
of a good cook its the lightness
of his cooking that martian was
such a hell of a good cook that he
couldnt help it that cake was so
damned light it just couldnt help
floating oh ho ho haa- ha-agh
