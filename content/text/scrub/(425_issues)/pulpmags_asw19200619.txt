 saved

 last night i came home with
great news our savings account
had passed the thousand dollar mark

  i remember reading one time that
your first thousand saved is the most
important money you will ever have for
in saving it you have laid a true founda-
tion for success in life

  and i remember how remote and impos-
sible it seemed then to save such a sum of
money i was making  a week and every
penny of it was needed to keep us going it
went on that way for several years-two or
three small increases but not enough to keep
up with the rising cost of living

  then one day i woke up i found i was
not getting ahead simply because i had never
leaoned to do anything in particular as a result
whenever an important promotion was to be
made i was passed by

  i made up my mind right then to invest an
hour after supper each night in my own future
so i wrote to scranton and arranged for a course
that would give me special training for our busi-
ness i cant understand why i had never realized
before that this was the thing to do why in
a few months i had a whole new vision of my
work the general manager was about the
first to note the change an opening came and
he gave me my first real chance-with an in-
crease a little later another promotion came
with enough money so that we could save 
a month then another increase-i could put
aside  each pay day and so it went

  today i am manager of my department-
with two increases this year we have a thou-
sand dollars saved and this is only the be-
ginning we are planning now for a home of
our own there will be new comforts for rose
little enjoyments we have had to deny ourselves
up to now and there is a real future ahead
with more money than i used to dare to dream
that i could make

  for  years the international correspond-
ence schools have been helping men and women
everywhere to win promotion to earn more
money to have happy prosperous homes to
know the joy of getting ahead in business and
in life

    more than two million have taken the up
  road with i c s help over  are now
  turning their spare time to profit hundreds

  are starting every day

    isnt it about time for you to find out what
  the i c s can do for you

    you too can have the position you want in
  the work of your choice you can have the kind
  of a salary that will make possible money in
  the bank a home of your own the comforts
  and luxuries you would like your family to
  have no matter what your age your occu-
  pation or your means-you can do it

    all we ask is the chance to prove it-without
  obligation on your part or a penny of cost
  thats fair isnt it

 me packs two guns

friendly blue-gray eyes a-twinkle
in their nets of sun-born wrinkles
light brown hair flaring out whimsi-
cally from under the clasp of his pushed-up
broad-brim ed burlane lolled in the saddle
atop midnight and listened in comfort to
the row for the stocky gnarled sprandle-
legged big man with the butt of his six-gun
snugged into the grip of his right hand
weapon half drawn had the  age  on the
man he was discussing so successfully and
cussing so gracefully and half of the popu-
lation of coppered jack knew it and was
watching from the outside  of the towns
straggling buildings and the other half
knew it and was watching from inside out
of the line of possible fire

  you ornery dog-faced no-count long-
 legged swallow-tailed man-skinner the
 man with the  age  fleered his voice
 heavy ominous  i got to my gun first
 ive got ye cold bart barnquist ye own
 or graze them big herds o yourn over half
 o san felice county but theres my lil
 shack an home spot an it stays with me
 im a son of a native son so theres no
 way yo cn honswaggle me out o my
  a-s	s

 home texas law wont low it doggone
 you hide

    you cam down peters the threatened
 man pleaded his face red sweat on his fore-
 head from which his sombrero was pushed
 back his hands were up his gun swung
 futilely as his body swayed with tremors of
 fear  i aint projectin to git your mite
 o a ranch-im only talkin lease-

    then why nt ye quit shoving an push-
 ing agin my bound ries with those irriga-
 tion ditches o yourn ye got all th water
 you cn use but youre bound to have my
 two springs runnin into your pipes an
 you quit rollin fakers agin me with those
 papers to sign which if i sign loses me my
 water holdins for a few measly dollars to
 you get me

   the hand holding the gun barely tensed
 yet the gun like a living thing had leaped
 forth and its muzzle was against the lower
 left-side ribs of the threatened man the
 barrel inclined gently upward in line with
 the heart

    ill quit the cornered barnquist slob-
 bered  ill let you alone-

    you better i been badgered an pes-
 tered eenuff twin springs suits me an it
 suits bernice my gal we stick till we

nicked on th nose so theyll spread too
and one o them slugs sure would sprandle
out wide in your yellow fat

  he ceased the street was quiet men
here and there frozen in their interest com-
bined with fear of the gunman whose facile
draw had proved his lethal skill in handling
his chosen weapon shifted their weight
sighed or spat peters swept a single
glance off barnquist but it took in every-
thing up and down the way before behind
on both sides then he turned sidewise
whisked about a building and was gone
with a speedy and pantherlike energy that
defied pursuit before they had awakened
the spellbound folk to the fact he had
mounted for the rataplan of horses hoofs
from behind the thimble belt saloon told
of peterss home-going up the alley behind
the towns few business places

  ed burlane who had followed the ac-
tions of the big man with such amused in-
terest smiled as he heard the thrumming
of the hoofs that told of peterss disappear-
ance he swept his glance about and noted
how the danger gone men came swarming
out buzzing gesticulating three or four
fellows plainly hangers-on came to barn-
quists side and began to counsel with him
as to what measures should be taken

  barnquist tugging savagely at the left
horn of his black mustache caressed the
butt of his gun with his right hand

   we cn git a posse together an skull-
drag him outn his hole an mebbe hell
try to shoot it out an then-

  so began one of the hangers-on a man
with a dry hard voice very light hair and
evebrows so thin and lacking in color they
seemed not to exist in certain plays of light
and shade his eyes were like agates cold
unfeeling keen

   youre whirling a bigger loop than you

cn throw barnquist cut him off with
 bellerin right out with all hell listenin
to you shoot your wad maltrane

   im generally able t throw any loop i
whirl the other crisped falling back  but
i didnt see you makin any fancy moves
while ol peters had you stuck up

  no i dont work by main strength
barnquist answered quieter now and in
full control of himself why didnt you
do something maltrane

   man i was taking forty winks in th
thimble belt an only woke up when it
was all over i was leanin against th back
wall with my chair tilted back you ask
barnum th barkeep

   he sure was a snoozin another man
confirmed pie was a little wiry spluttery
fellow with a much-chewed pipe-stem in
constant action between nervously active
teeth  he was lost in dreams far away
by now a score of men had swarmed
about barnquist he waved them aside
and started to plow through the crowd
toward the thimble belt but midnight
towering up was in the way burlane was
looking down amusedly his smile proving
his enjoyment of the scene he had ridden
in quietly to come squarely against the lit-
tle street drama unrolling and had stopped
his horse to watch the row of a kind not
uncommon in old times in the long-horn
country

  the good horse did not move midnight
only heeded one voice-eds burlane had
reared the big stallion from colthood when
he had worked for the x m t outfit near
vernon texas and had found the colt al-
most starved its mother dead ed had
bottle-fed the little fellow at first then
made him his own special pet had broken
him put the first saddle on him and so
the bond between them was strong endur-
ing unless ed spoke or twitched rein
midnight would not move from where he
had been halted

  barnquist broke eruptively through the
human ring head down bull-like intent

 cme on into th belt you two he
called to maltrane and the sputterv wiry
man- maltrane an weaver cme on
he half turned continued his headlong
onset the people had parted from before
midnight of the ranges



him like chips before a wave be butted
his head into the solid haunch of midnight
the horse did not move except to toss his
head

  barnquist drew back and for the first
time saw the obstacle against which he had
hurtled so blindly saw also the easy
good-natured smile of ed burlane as he
lolled in his saddle viewing the whole scene
with the air of a philosopher

   git that-boss outa th way barnquist
snarled

   you seem to resemble yousef ed
dropped down pleasantly from his serene
height

  barnquists face became purple mal-
trane and weaver backing him up thrust
forward belligerently weaver spluttering
champed on his pipe stem maltrane s agate
eyes clashed in glances with eds own that
by now were steadying to keen regard of
the trio

  barnquist smacked his lips in a peculiar
manner the nimble hands of maltrane
and weaver slid weaponward

   id not do that if i were you hom-
bres

  burlane hardly seemed to stir yet move
melting into move his bands had flashed
one to each hip and with sure-fire accuracy
of the born two-gun man his s flicked
into line the two hireling killers froze
barnquist stilled

  a pressure of burlanes knee a whispered
word and midnight quietly stepped offside
but so steadily that eds weapons did not
deviate by a hairs breadth from their aim

   now go where you was a-gain an be
quick he ordered  vamose poco pron-
to im not aimin for trouble hereabouts
but im not dodgm any that comes my
way im just ridin for a job after quit-
ting x m t an if youll inquire back
to vernon theyll tell you who  am 

  the baffled trio stalked by the big black
horse whose ears were cocked at them and
whose aristocratic nose sniffed at them in
passing the twin guns kept in line until
the two had passed hehind the swinging
doors of the saloon then at a touch of
eds heel the giant equine wheeled as if
on a pivot and was lost under a dust cloud
before the spectators could get their wits

  as the horse galloped off the saloon door
slammed back and wteaver gun in hand
appeared he swung the weapon up his
left hand crossed over right the wrist of the
right hand firm against the wrist of the left
that was atop-in the attitude for a long-
range shot he was steadying for the pull
when a bluff tall young man yelled from
the crowd

  u put it up now put it up

  the speaker broke from the crowed and
came to weavers side in a few strides he
was ruddy of face well built eager alert
his eyes were deeply set his hair black in-
tensely so a neat suit of wide-wale cor-
duroy a fine pair of high-heeled riding
boots a silver-trimmed stetson completed a
costume that became him well his neck
was encircled with a white and black
checked handkerchief carelessly knotted
under the collar of his gray flannel shirt
plainly he was of the blood of barnquist-
the inheritance of shifty glittering black
eyes told that as well as the bulk of torso
and limbs

  maltrane had thrown the guns muzzle
out of line at the others first word striking
over weavers shoulder from inside the
saloon to do it weaver grinned knowingly
at the young man who had given the com-
mand

  all right barney he agreed holster -
ing the weapon

   what d y mean letting him get off
like that and barnquist came through the
swinging doors of the saloon quickly

   barney here said-

   whos bossin ox bow ranch me or
barney barnquist demanded

   i reckon you are maltrane said coldly

   then-

  	 you let mai be old man the young
man said  i saw it all an ive got an
idea-

   lets get under cover then no use
shooting our wad before all the town pup
the father growled

  bamey took mai trailes arm and nudged
him into the saloon his father followed
a dozen men edged in on one excuse or
another to find the father son and two
retainers gone into a rear room where their
voices rumbling could be heard parley


all-story weekly

brown lean morose evaded queries with
the saloon keepers usual skill and gradu-
ally it sifted into the united consciousness
of the populace of coppered jack that the
towns boss wanted no enlightenment or
asistance and the men dribbled out by ones
twos or threes leaving the barroom vacant
save for barnum wiping up the last drops
of spilled liquor and brown one ear cocked
toward the tightly closed back room where
the four still talked in heavy undertones
that defied all attempts at eavesdropping

  the saloon keeper ordered

   you barnum im going in there as
barnquist ordered you watch an discour-
age any attempts to listen in against the
partition

  he bartender cocked one sly eye at the
thimble belts owner nodded casually and
continued his wiping-up process that com-
pleted he stood at ease against the back of
the rough bar his lantern-jawed face avid
with a curiosity as to what was going on
behind the partition but his dull sunken
eyes denoting the caution of his ilk-a cau-
tion that kept him away from the dangerous
sport of eavesdropping on the quartet be-
hind the screening boards where the buzz
of half-muted tongues told of plans being
made plans of evil omen

  coppered jack the very name the
proof of some hectic moment in border an-
nals vernon was far off to the east south-
east to northwest was twin springs and
the main trail that forked to there went
on and on whiffed to powdery dust by
hoofs of plodding teams from little soda
to the south was but the open range roll-
ing vacant for many an hours lope toward
mexico and almost directly southeast of
coppered jack were the huge barnquist
holdings some legal some illegal more pre-
empted by right of the six-guns eminent
domain and a little below the barnquist
place typical of its sort was the chaparral
cock a mere wayside aguardiente joint
so the geography of the region fixed the
saloon keeper parley brown going to the
dividing door claims attention

  brown tapped at the rough-boarded door
to the rear room the buzzing of voices
ceased and he was given

   come in brown if thas whot is

  he dodged in and shut the door carefully
the four-barnquist his son maltrane and
weaver-were grouped about a table seated
on up-ended boxes

   room clear barnquist demanded his
heavy-jowled face less red now that his
anger was in leash

    yes sir

   sit down and barnquist wagged a
crooked forefinger toward a vacant box seat

  brown obeyed the four drew their
heads in toward the tables center browns
joined them they began to confer again
barnquist leading

   parley brown weve got to meet this
defi o peters

  yes boss two blazers run on you in
one day calls for a showdown

   oh that range rider from over vernon
way has gone folks will forget him if we
dont stir him up barney barnquist cut
in with

   he sure had a ready pair of weapons
weaver spluttered champing his pipestem
loudly

   youd a had him if barney hadnt
stopped you maltrane offered

   yes lars an wed had the hull x m
t outfit over to see what happened to him
barney countered with  im only a little
better n of age but i got some sense
aready if dad does call me pup with a
side glance of sinister import at his father
who was too intent upon present business
to note it

   how is a question his father said
shortly  but whats done is done first
question is how to run old peters out of the
country hes got those twin springs on his
place a clear title-

   an a quick draw weaver snuffled
between bites at his pipe

   no use rubbing it in thataway weav
maltrane flicked his white eyebrows down-
drawn in a sinister scowl his agate eyes
were hard glinting

   no lets not spend any time mouthin
over whats past the elder barnquist
blurted yet under his breath one thing
at a time howm we goin to get peters
i cn work it for a warrant an we cn get
some of our men deputized-maltrane and
weaver here and others-and if he shoots
midnight of the ranges



it out he loses he cant buck the hull
law forces of san felic county

   old man let me have a throw at this
barney offered suddenly

  you got a plan you pup near
time with keen derision

   yes peters will be in town soon you
meet him peaceable til be with you
well git him into the barroom for a friend-
ly drink and once inside-brown here
maneuvering to have the room empty ex-
cept for us-we cn frame something on
him that will stick with only we folks as
witnesses

  the elder barnquists hand shot out
across the rough boards

   you gof a head on you pup he let out
admiringly  i alius told the boys youd
be woth raisin after you got your gait

   sure sounds good maltrane agreed

   good boy barney weaver champed
on his pipestem

  brown nodded silent assent

   and heres what we frame barney
went on as the heads drew in closer and
closer  everone knows old peters shoots
a  and that he nicks the nose of ever
bullet so t will mushroom or spread out
and make a bigger wound thas why hes
got that name  nicked-nose peters

   yes his father breathed his fat
tongue licking his full lips  sounds
good pup you show a few brains like
this an youll be a man yet

  well we get him in here maltrane and
weavers in the back room here wtien
peterss back is to the door o this room and
hes drinkin with us you two shoot mal-
trane you shoot at peters with your 
weaver you shoot all around the room us-
ing a  and nicked-nose bullets weaver
you shoot first and at the shot peters will
wheel trying to draw pop and i will jump
aside as peters turns maltrane you get
him you never miss then pop can
shoot a couple o times at peters or wild
weaver grabs peters cold gun shoves his
own thats like it-they both ordered by
mail th same dav three vears ago remem-
ber

   i get you boy the father whispered
tensely  the crow-d comes in finds peters
dead me with my gun hot and smokin and

peters gun seemingly good and hot him
plugged me o k the ceiling an walls are
full of nicked-nose bullets every one will
know what has made them mushroom out
so weaver cn manage to shoot once into
that pile o wet bar-clothes barnum keeps
behind th bar eh that will save one
nick-nosed bullet unsmashed-a sure proof
that peters was using his gun

   you got it pop the younger barn-
quist whispered excitedly  an in th ex-
citement it will pass off that no one will
think of maltranes gun seeins peters will
be plugged seemingly by yourn it will
look like-

   jus as if peters came in after youd
made up maltrane sibilated  got ornery
over his licker drew an bart beat him
out on th draw an he shot wild after he
w-as plugged we cn all stick to that story
no trial will be necessary

  no a coroners jury-one that wed
pick-would bring in a verdict that peters
committed suicide laughed weaver end-
ing in a fit of sputtered champings that
testified to his satisfaction with the plot

   but wont folks notice peters havin my
gun weaver suddenly spoke up

   not in th bustle barney barnquist
judged  in a minute or two when a good
chance comes i cn sneak peterss gun off
somewhere shoot it out so itll be powder-
blackened in barrel and cylinder substi-
tute it an give you back yours weaver
who cn object mai here -as resident
depty o this end o san felice will have
charge o th corpse and effects until th
sheriff comes in an sheriff harvison will do
bouts pop says eh

   he will the father snapped  because
he knows who swings th big bunch o
votes down in this corner that decides th
countys plurality on sheriff its th barn-
quist crowd eh boys

   easy nuff champed weaver
maltrane grinned nastily his cold hard
eyes glitering

   i cn see his back before me now he
breathed f an i wish t was right now we
were to put th slug into him

   if anything goes wrong ill back up
your play with my gun-th new  that
dad give me a while ago-


all-story weekly

   mighty little need for you after mal-
trane draws one bead on him at close quar-
ters and with the age in his favor bar-
ney barnquist interjected  mai never
misses peters is bout th onliest man
hereabouts cn beat him on th draw but
he cant shoot any straighter n mai cn
though

   gimme the age an ill lay him out
cold maltrane said

   and now we all want our parts planned
out so therell be no slips brown sug-
gested lets go over it all so there can
be no mistake on just what each is to do
 before we do that though weaver cut
in  we gotta think o this thing if we
git rid o peters th little place  be his
girls

   leave that to me barney said sud-
denly  i can take care of that part of it
ho hoi his father laughed have
you been trying to brand that maverick
ill git a lease o th water at twin springs
fom her hell-bent quick

   yes an im sure i cn throw my loop
over her once her ornery dad is out o th
way

   does he object to your seeing her
the father asked

   yes ordered me off the place a week
ago -bitterly  i overplayed my hand i
guess got a bit rough with the girl

   ha ha chip o th old block his
father laughed slapping the son on the
back they got up and went out together
only brown remaining on the way out
barnum reported that no customers had
entered the saloon during their conclave

chapter ii

at twin springs

when ed burlane swaying easily in
his saddle despite the speed of
midnight topped the edge of the
little cup in which coppered jack lay he
saw off up-trail the cloud of dust that
told of peters going fast burlane was too
sensible to give midnight his head and let
the huge black horse run down peterss
dappled dun cayuse for to have ridden
up suddenly from behind in a cloud of

trail-murk would have invited and war-
ranted a shot under the circumstances as
peters fleeing from coppered jack would
have substantial reason for supposing that
the stranger was after him for a deadly
purpose

  ed contented himself with keeping mid-
night in sight of the sign peterss going cast
into the air far ahead the trail was dry
-bone dry so the dust-pillar of the
fugitive was a safe guide

   looks to me midnight ed confided
to the horses off ear  as if that old nester
ahead o us two had a job on his hands
an hes got a gal with a pretty name
whats th use riding after a job when
theres plenty fun right under our noses
eh old son-of-a-gun

   midnight twitched that off ear into which
the confidence had been poured he
pranced and made a little pasear off-trail
then back then made up the ground he
had lost in a few strides ed didnt even
notice this so accustomed was he to the
horses playful ways

  after a time burlane saw peters turn
down a side trail toward a group of butts
to the right on the way they passed the
laborers-mexicans-at work on the barn-
quist irrigation ditches burlane studied it
out and saw how the water from the peters
place could be turned into the ditch easily
it only needed some straight digging across
the open plain to bring it about

  ed let midnight walk until he could see
in the shadow of the buttes the sod-house
the little corral the sod-barn the hen-
house of the old nester the windmill
creaked cheerily as the evening wind drove
it and the trickle of water it was raising
into the troughs where the cattle were
watered was pleasant to at least one pair
of ears and midnight twitched his forward
at its tinkle tinkle tinkle

   you go mighty slow you old son-of-a-
gun ed cautioned we arent a going
bang up against this old gunmans house
without a hail to let him know were
friendlylike if we do hes more n likely
to drill us first and investigate afterward
and serve us right if he did

  at a word the black horse stepped
slowly then at another stilled like a
midnight of the ranges



statue by now they were almost abreast
of the house that was fast closed as to
doors and windows a little wreath of
smoke over the chimney-top told ed of
supper to come as did the spicy smell of
frying bacon that had remained on the air
after the last person in had slammed the
portal fast shut

  peterss tired horse from the corral bars
whickered midnight started a reply but
the weight of eds hand on his mane
stopped it dead

  burlane raised his hand to his lips
cupped it and called

   hello the house 

  there was no reply burlanes glance
wandered along the low front of the sod-
house caught the glint of a muzzle that
he was sure had been covering him from the
first he smiled a bit called again

   hello the house will your dog bite
 you jus sit tight whar you be young
timer till i come out he heard peters
call through the windows crack where the
glint of muzzle was  a guns on you i
want to see what sot of a harpen you are
anyways

   ijl be good ed called settling back
more easily in the saddle hands openly
crossed on the pommel

   stay right like that if you take those
hans down youll get a slug peters
boomed

   i dont want to be slugged i want to
be fed ed laughed

  the door swung open the old gunman
leaped out his  at a  ready ed
grinned at him

   mighty handy with that tool of youm
old-timer i saw you fade that crowd in
coppered jack

   i did see ye on the aidge o th crowd
sitting on that big black hoss peters said
lowering his gun  shucks you aint noth-
ing to barnquist

 no i had to throw down on him too
to get out of town he tried to butt a hole
in my hoss and ordered me out the way
 hes a habit of ordering folks offn th
hull green airth

   i noticed that he resembles himself a
whole lot

   yes th resemblance is good too ho

you bernice its all right come on out
holstering his gun so smoothly the eye could
hardly follow it

  ed watched the door in a moment it
framed a vision

  her face was good-open filled with
womanly charm the lips were full sweetly
bowed mobile her color was not high
the nose was a bit short perhaps and the
warm-toned hair strayed over forehead and
down the nape of her neck in wayward at-
tractiveness she was dressed in a faded
print dress and her shoes were stubbed
out as to toes yet withal she was a girl
that any good man would want to know
to please and make his confidante

  burlanes broad-brim swept low over his
saddle as he bowed in answer to her greet-
ing given at her fathers word of expla-
nation

   youre sure welcome stranger light
down put your hoss in our home corral
an come in an hep us eat supper

   i sure will ed said with no feigned
heartiness he swung down stripped saddle
and bridle from midnight with a few deft
motions he clouted the horse with friendly
zest into the corral where midnight joined
the peters horses eagerly he hung up
horse gear in the barn and then went in-
doors to find peters seated before the table
m the large room that did duty as living-
room and kitchen already the girl had a
platter of crisped bacon on the table the
odor of coffee well flavored came to ed
and the alluring aroma of pone and baked
beans

   heap his plate bernice her father
urged we dont ofen get a stranger in
to snack with us les treat him well while
we got him

  she stepped about briskly ed saw his
plate mounded well sampled the coffee and
began to eat between bites he tokl peters
the details of his encounter with barnquist
the old nester nodding at him sagely the
while

   you did right to throw down onto him
prontohe approved  wen op barn-
quists on th prod hes apt to do anythin
mean an low-down

   whats he-so bent on havin thfs little
nook of yours for


all-story weekly

   why hes got control of all the good
water hereabouts theres enough for cop-
pered jack from wells there but barnquist
owns the water rights that are good else-
where except these two springs of mine
that ive got tanked up were changing
here from open range to closed barnquist
sees that water ditched in and owned out-
right will be valuable hes surrounding
it hes fraid hes let drop sot i got it
that ill have a supply and head him off on
the monopoly he wants to get when the soda
company begins to team its stuff out to the
railroad from the little desert where the
company owns a small borax slough

   he opines to make money selling water
for the teams and teamsters and mebbe
to the railroad that folks say will come
through one day berenice added with the
direct easy manner of the plains girl

   he seems to whirl a mighty big loop
ed said luxuriating in the final draft of
coffee

   he sure does but hes made it too big
when hes tried to cover twin springs
peters insisted

   your title good

   yes one of those old mexican war
titles that reads  as long as grass grows an
water runs the little place goes to my
gal here when im through with it

  ed glanced at her her eyes met his
frankly fully he liked that no attempt at
coyness no false modesty

  he rolled a cigarette she was up in a
moment and back with two burning pliant
splints lighted at the hearth one for ed
one for her fathers pipe

   you dont suppose theyll try some
underhand game on you ed inquired
after the two men had puffed in silence for
a few moments as the girl quickly and
deftly gathered up the dishes and made
ready for her household task of after-supper
cleansing the two men had drawn back
into one corner of the room to give her
full play for her womanly activities

   they cant try much more n they have
aready peters puffed  theyve tried loco
weed poison fire arrows shot into my
stacks of wild hay-about everthing in-
cluding men trying to buy me out on fake
papers im going to stick by mighty

wrhat theyve done is eenough this home

him-

   i didnt see him is he like his dad
a not on top but down under more so
i guess id ruther see bernice dead than
tied to him

   uhuh and ed wragged his head he
rumpled up his hair with his strong fingers
a keen sense of hominess was upon him
he stretched out in his chair rubbed his
lean long legs and sighed contentedly

   you ridin far young timer peters
asked

   who me ed stalled wondering
what he could say

   yes cause if you wasnt in a hurry-
 oh im not as the girl came in bring-
ing the lamp needed to chase away the
gathering shadows the dusk had been bring-
ing forth from the rooms corners bere-
nice wtent softly out into the outer air hum-
ming a bit of melody

   you might visit a while wed sure be
glad to have you stay ive got two or three
trillin jobs that ive been saving till an-
other man came long to hep so you neednt
feel youre imposing on me

  ed puffed contentedly out somewhere
in the dusk he heard midnight whicker he
strolled to the door the girl was at the
corral bars the big stallions head was over
her shoulder burlane stared-midnight
so offish making up to the girl stranger

   im giving him a lump o sugar mr
burlane she called  i hope you wont

cheerfully

midnight of the ranges



reminded from within as he thumped his
chair about into a new position of ease
j  ill stay  longs you want me ed said
i fve got no plans or projects ahead jus
riding for a job an to see th country here-
away

    all right peters said heartily  well

coppered jack to get some wire an staples

stuff out on that suit you

    sure old-timer

   the girl had finished feeding the stallion
as she left him he strained his neck out
after her and w-hickered again

    oh you old flatterer she chided turn-
ing and spatting his muzzle with the flat
of her hand

  midnight whickered again the girl
laughed and strolled toward the house sing-
ing as she came

 oh the chisholm trail is a long long road

but when i ride it i dont pack no load

for it leads to one that i love best

and the trails far end spells rest pard rest

   how long you goin to stay mr bur-
lane she asked as she neared the door

   till you folks take a club an chase
me over the hills to th next range he
laughed her fresh free laughter duetted
with his own and the deep booming of the
old mans made it a trio midnight from
the corral bars added his chest-deep whick-
er to the three and then it was a quartet of
good will and agreement

chips from old blocks

after the conference in the saloon the
bamquists father and son went to
the wagon-yard of coppered jack
the place where all sorts and conditions of
men put out their horses weaver and
maltrane followed retainerlike at a re-
spectful distance

  the two bamquists followed by the
others were soon mounted and riding
toward their ranch the ox bow so called
because their brand was shaped like an ox-

bow the barnquist ranch-house was one
of the finest in the southwest rambling
over an ample space and enclosing a  gal-
lery  in the center it was white-painted
with many airy large windows the bunk-
houses wrere ample and clean and the best
of bedding food and everything to work
with was furnished the barnquist ranch-
hands and hangers-on barnquist was
known not to haggle over wages if he could
get done those things he wanted done and
without question be it known however
that often very fine range-riders bronco-
busters and wranglers refused to wrork for
him the ox bow clan were surly offish
mean

  barnquist was a widower fie had a
crew of subservient mexicans about the
house who kept some sort of order under
the captaincy of a big half-breed papago
who had been brought up on the place she
had been separated from her own tribe ever
since barney barnquists mother had died
and had looked after the boy first as nurse
then as preceptor in all sorts of ranch-life
escapades this woman greasewood kate
dressed as a white woman but had the
heavy face sturdy body and quick actions
of the papago squaw as barney had
grown in bulk and years he had escaped
from her tutelage but she had taken charge
of the household and in some rough-and-
ready way managed to govern the other
servants she was known to be honest and
decent and bart barnquist heeded her
somewhat and trusted her

  a little way out of coppered jack father
and son passed a group of mexicans work-
ing on the irrigation ditch they greeted
their employer cordially and barnquist
threw a handful of cigarettes to them for
which they scrambled

  the hulking ranch-owner laughed to see
them scrabble thus for his meanly bestowed
bounty he spurred his horse a magnifi-
cent roan powerful and well-boned anc
barney rode silently at his side for a while
suddenly the elder man turned to the son

   i suppose you sometimes wonder pup
what im sinking all that money in that
ditch for especially s i dont give you
much cash money he asked

   yes but i knew twould do me no good


all-story weekly

to ask barney answered sulkily twitching
meanly at the bridle of his rather poor-
shaped pinto

   you bet it wouldnt pup till i got
good and ready to tell now listen you
shewed headwork in planning that job on
nicked-nose peters to-day and in stopping
weaver from plugging him right in th open
an fom behind like youre raisin a few
brains under your wide brim about time
too now listen

   i cn see what others cant in th range
country we big catlie-men have got to
buy land or peel down to smaller holdins
and raise better steers feed them on rough-
age we raise the days of free range are
going to end pup not right away but
before your time is full im going to grab
off what water my ditch will bring me down
and be ready it  pay for itself in water
sold to the little soda lake teams and
teamers if we cn get shet o peters who
has those twin springs and cn sell or give
water awav and keep me from chargin what
i like youll see th day pup when them
irrigation works of mine  be woth a
heap

    admire your head-piece pap har-
ney said with a show of warmth  and
nowt youve seen my heads on straight
let me in on some of your schemes and
treat me less like a kid will you

  the father turned and looked at the son
with an expression of contempt on his
florid countenance

   you got fine hosses good clothes good
guns for th askin pup i give you a cer-
tain amount o coin-

   yes pap but you treat me like a kid

i	cn ride better n most o your range-
riders shoot like hell-fire-but no one
knows it i practised secret like you said
say dad with a sudden burst of confi-
dence u gimme a few hundred dollars to
spend jus as i want eh i sure want
to-

  the father glanced back the two re-
tainers were a safe distance behind

   you quit whinin like that pup barn-
quist sneered  when im gone youll han-
die the money and be boss but till then you
take what things i pass out to you hear
pup his tone became menacing heavy

  the young man flashed a glance of re-
sentment at the father who laughed

   i like to see you look jike that pup
you look jus like a barnquist black-
browed scowling no pup when you show
youre a man hard able to handle it youll
get plenty of money

   ill show you-some day pap the
young man growled his face drawing into a
meaner scowl still  i want money real
money like other folks has cash money
not credit at what omerv stores is in cop-
pered jack and bar credit and tobacco
money i want cash money-

   to spend on some of those mexican gals
in town eh or to buy some geegaw to
make it solid with that calico-skirted half-
shod filly out to twin springs eh why nt
you take what you want in calico eh pup
he guffawed heavily a flare of deeper
passion marking his face that had become
almost purple with the force of his argu-
ment		
u pap and the sons voice grated rough-
ly over the soft thudding of the hoofs of
the loping horses on the trail  im goin
to have money-plenty of money cask
money im goin to handle it myself pap
mind that

   you get it-ef you cn pup but not
offn me-yet

  he cut his horse sharply with his quirt
and drove the spurs into its flanks the
animal bucked and he smashed it with the
quirts butt and gripped it with his huge
knees roaring with laughter as his spurs
tore its haunches to ribbons barney
watched this exhibition with sullen face
in a few moments the horse was reduced to
a quivering abject condition barnquist
forced the animal back onto the trail again
and jeered

   there son is what  happen to you
if you buck-jump on me an try to get hold
of any cash money but what i give you
ill ride you and spur you an make you a
sight for the hull range but go as i want
you to and when i feel a good ready youll
have plenty of cash money to spend

  he let up on the cruel bit and relaxed
his knees the horse groaned with relief
in a moment he had the animal loping again
toward home
midnight of the ranges



  barney a bit behind ceased not to scowl
at his fathers back and refused several in-
vitations to draw up beside him maltrane
and weaver quite a distance behind had
not been direct witnesses of this little scene
and had overheard nothing of the heated
conversation between the two

  leaving the main trail the four went
loping up to the barnquist ranch father
and son tossed the reins of their horses to
weaver and maltrane and went toward the
house the son clung determinedly to the
heels of the father and followed him into the
doorway of a room on the corner of the
house-a large  office where barnquist
kept his few account-books and had a home-
made desk and chairs barney slammed the
door behind him as they entered

  his father wheeled on the young fellow
when they were inside

   well what re you naggin along back
of me like that for pup didnt i tell you
what there was to it

   you had your say pap his face mot-
tled with anger  an ive had mine now
gimme some cash money i want-a lot
 a lot eh spreading out his legs and
putting his big hands under the back of his
coat  youre not a-girlin it are you
you never showed no spunk like that be-
fore

   never you mind pap i want cash
money now

  his jaw was set his fists doubled

  like lightning the father struck-once
the son caught fair crumpled barnquist
stooped flicked the gun from the sons
holster and threw it in the corner barney
staggered up his hand to his jaw

   you found who runs this ranch then
pup barnquist growled go pick up
your fool gun-and git out

  for a moment the son seemed about to
renew the fight then a look of submission
spread over his face and he took his hand
from his jaw and came forward he put
out his hand and took that of his father
who tried to avoid the clasp

   i say pap he whined  dont hit me
like that pap ill quit askin for cash
money and go on credit like i have

  he dropped the niggard hand of his
father stooped got his gun holstered it

smoothly and went out as he went his
father sneered

   huh i thought youd hit back-once
pup im about sure youre not woth rais-
ing such a pulin no-count meek lam as
you are go in a corner an chaw a bone
the door slammed barnquist sat down
and laughed amusedly

  but outside the door the son his face
convulsed with hate was standing one
clenched fist raised the other hand gripped
about his guns butt he wheeled and col-
lided with a heavy form in the passageway
that led from the outer entrance to the
ranch-houses interior-the one leading
from office to living-rooms it was grease-
wood kate ox bows breed house man-
ager

  barney gasped then relaxed

   why barwee another fight weeth
heem

   yes kate and sure as youre a half-
papago ill fight back some day-

  her broad firm hand went over his
mouth she drew him down the little side
corridor

   careful barnee he is master of ox
bow yet

   but wont all-ways be kate and
when im master-

   you will marry my girl like you have
promised

   yes kate but dont nag me on that
doggone it time enough to talk about
that-later

   yes time enough-if you talk right
bar nee but you member a papago
squaws girl is not a mexican flirt to be
put off with a present

   draw in on your loop kate squirm-
ing past her and bursting into the room at
the end of the passage

  the half-breed woman was silent as she
followed him she seemed about to renew
the conversation when the door at the
farther end of the room opened and a
girl of perhaps fifteen entered shyly her
face brightened as she saw the half-breed
she was dressed in a simple white dress
with a pink ribbon in her black hair that
was down her back in a thick glossy braid
her eyes were dark slumberous liquid
her lips and cheeks full crimsoned with


all-story weekly

health and not coarsely rich she was al-
ready a woman in the full tide of young life

   hello barwec her voice came full
deep like that of the woman  aim glad
you come

  she came to him with a gliding easy
grace reaching her hands out to him

  barney took her hands drew her to him
carelessly gave her a passing kiss and
brushed by her with scarcely a word he
went out of the door by which she had
entered and left her with her mother as
the door slammed behind the young ranch-
er the girl turned to greasewood kate with
eyes that blazed

   he-he kiss no more same as he did
hes-a not goin love me some more

   you are a fool ess-way her mother
said but she drew the girl to her for a mo-
ment and patted her glossy braid u bar-
wee hes had anoth fight weeth hees pap
hell be back you must not mind ess-
way he promise me again he marry you
when hes-a boss on ox bow

  the girl straightened her shoulders and
drew away from her mother saying

   hes-a goin marry me yes were
white and mex yes but were indian
too let barnee keep that to his mind
she turned and went down to the pas-
sage toward the out-of-doors her mother
glanced through a side window and smiled
to see her a moment later mounted astride
galloping off on a horse riding it without
saddle and with only a twitch-rope about
its lower jaw indian fashion

   she said right we are papago the
mother thought as she saw the girl go out
of sight over the nearest roll of the open
prairie

chapter iv

why barney wanted cash money

  after supper barney barnquist his
a face smoothed out a smile of bluff
good-will on his lips lounged out
toward the bunk-house he called to mal-
trane who with several other hard-faced
men was lounging before the building

   hey mai get out my fancy saddle an
lil brown mare

   sure bossr lars maltrane responded
quickly while he went for the saddle and
to the corral for the mare barney joked
with the men he carried himself with a
bluff assurance that seemed to take well
with them and most of them seemed anx-
ious to please the young cattle prince

  soon he was in the saddle riding away
toward the main trail instead of turning
toward coppered jack however he turned
southeast

   off to mescalero pedros again
laughed maltrane  off to th chaparral
cock eh

  yes an pedros got a new gal there
thats a stringin him along or my names
not weaver the spluttery slim little man
joked

  there were many sly laughs and nudges

   half th mexicans-the men-are wild
over the new woman pedros brought up
from las alamos to tend bar an half th
women here are jealous aready maltrane
said

  barnquist put his sturdy little mare to a
brisk lope she thudded the miles behind
her a full moon was coming later now
the open country was in the soft sunset
afterglow after a while the trail dipped
into a draw and at the mouth of it on a
little rise of ground was a squatty sprawl-
ing building with outbuildings grouped
about it-a typical roadside drinking-place
of the old southwest

  there was no reason why it should have
been in just that place it might have been
in a hundred thousand others just as ac-
cessible or inaccessible but there it was
a place to drink in to lounge in to swap
lies in and off behind far down the draw
were hackberries and a spring under the
fairly steep slope

  barnquist found a few mexicans dicing
it a cow-puncher or two drinking trade
was dull the woman leaning over the bar
languidly barney swaggered in after
standing his well-broken mare at the tie-
rail

   lo maretta he gave the dark-eyed
woman gimme a-a shot o pulque

  the woman smiled reached down bottle
and glass and spun them toward him he
tossed off a drink threw a coin down
midnight of the ranges



  she twisted a brown cigarette and held
it up for him after lighting it between her
own lips he giggled put out a clumsy-
hand in a rough callow attempt at an en-
dearment she drew back and laughed
she went to the other end of the counter
to wait on a cow-puncher who called for a
whisky she lingered listening to his com-
pliments while barnquist glowered she
went back to barney soon lips pouting

   ah maretta he pleaded  talk to
me-honest im wild over you

  she laughed and went to answer an-
other call barney sat down heavily

  the woman over the shoulder of the new
customer shot barney a glance of encour-
agement he glowered pretending to be
miffed but when the customer went he
stalked to the bar bought another drink
of something-he did not notice what

  they had the bar to themselves she
toyed with the young fellow as a cat toys
with a mouse pouting advancing retreat-
ing now taking a puff from his cigarette
now lightly boxing his ears as he whispered
some heavy bit of persiflage into the ear
that she kept tiptilted toward him

  there came the beat of hoofs at the door
a quick command in spanish spurs jan-
gled bells on a mans big hat tinkled in
through the door lithe agile a mexican
strode he paused a moment hands in the
folds of his sash his dark handsome face
attentive his cigarette curling its wisp of
smoke about his feautres the woman at
the bar shot him a phrase

   ho pedro come here come senor
aguilar come

   si senoritaand he came easily grace-
fully hands on swaying lips the woman
made him listen motioned for him to put
his head to theirs

  the three heads-the americans the
two mexicans-drew together over the bar
barneys voice sank to a whisper

   honest now pedro tell her im good
for any money- 

   maretta with an air of candor in
low wheedling voice  what thees-a senor
says is-a true he is barnquist laik hees
sayin

   there didnt i tell you barnquist
said elated louder

   well then eef you be barnquist how-a
you soo stingee you buy da dreenk yes
but avra cow-puncher hees got roll cask
monee

   honest now maretta honest ill get
a roll like i said well blow outa here
eh-down to vernon eh-have a go of it
ill get a roll a big big roll-

  she puffed disdainfully at a cigarette
that she rolled deftly

   maybe she said quietly  maybe
now run away off kid an grow to be a
man before you-a come teasin round me
barney drew back his face working with
rage baffled passions struggling for the
mastery he cursed spat turned and
tramped out as he went he heard the
womans laughter floating after him he
glanced back pedro was kissing the girl
over the bar a moment later the rattle of
hoofs told of the young mans departure

   well played my maretta pedro com-
plimented her in spanish starting back and
beginning to laugh  if we can get the
young senor barnquist to free himself of
his fathers hand he will come here spend
his money like water play him then ma-
retta well and hard once he is in our
grip it shall go well with us his father
is too good a business man to let his men
hang about our place we get only the
passing trade eh but once the young
barnquist is his own master he will conie
and bring others after himself when he
is sole heir if you keep him in leading
strings by pretty by-plays we will both be
rich my dulce senorita

  the little brown mare was quivering
with pain and weak from hard usage when
barney barnquist spun her up from the
main trail and into the ranch yard he
swung off before the bunk-houses and stood
still a moment after he had alighted
there was a light streaming from a door
far down the line of outbuildings the
tinkle of a mandolin came to him barn-
quist smiled to hear it

   monte joes got em altogether playing
those fool songs of hisn barney said to
himself he uncinched the saddle yanked
the bridle off whacked the little mare in
the corral he went into the saddlery
room and flung the gear onto a peg then


all-story weekly

came out softly he went along the bunk-
house until he came to a window he
stood alert lighted a cigarette and leaned
against the window casing apparently
idling the mandolin tinkled lights
twinkled in the big house a horse off in
the home corral neighed

  barneys arm stole inside the open win-
dow his hand fumbled about in the gloom
inside and found a thimble-belt that hung
there it came back he opened it and
in the palm as he made his cigarette glow
to show it was a  cartridge

   youll never miss that weaver and
it  do me a power o good he told him-
self then he went slowly to the door
whence the mandolin was tinkling looked
in joked and said to weaver

   im just in thought you fellows were
enjoyin yourseves so i turned the mare
into the corral myself

 he went away whistling weaver
thanked him the mandolin tinkled

  near the house a white form came from
behind a bush he paused a moment to
chat with ess-way then brushed by her
leaving her to stand there her arms out
he switched inside along the corridor past
the  office then up-stairs he undressed
hurriedly then tumbled into bed soon his
deep breathing could have been heard by
any one in the hallway outside and was
heard for the half-breed woman came tip-
toeing along listened then went down
outside she found the girl sobbing a little
leaning against the outer door jamb

   be quiet ess-way she urged u he
was only tired-went right up and to bed
the girl soon followed slyly watchfully
and went up-stairs like a mouse the
mother sat on the door-step and watched
her go-then went indoors again

  the ranch-house stilled the horses ceased
to move about in the moon-white home cor-
ral the mandolin tinkled the elder
barnquist came loping in from some quest
and had his horse taken care of all was
quiet

  barney barnquist got up softly and put
match to lamps wick he sat on the floor
the lamp beside him working over an out-
spread paper first he took out the pur-
loined -caliber cartridge and worked and

worked at the nose of the ball until it came
out he wrapped the empty shell and pow-
der grains in a wisp of paper and set them
aside he cut a nick in the nose of the
bullet and laid that aside then getting
his own gun a  side-throw-out pattern
from its holster hanging at the beds head
he worked a bullet from the end of one of its
shells taking the shell from his belt

  barney was careful not to lose the powder
from that  shell atop of the powder he
played a little wad then he worked the
-caliber bullet from the stolen shell on
sop swaging it into place with bits of paper
he worked a false crimp in the end of the
brass shell-case to grip the smaller bullet in
as well as it could be done finally he was
satisfied that the added wad would hold in
the powder that the ball would not rattle
from the paper wedges and false crimping
then he took the rammer of his gun from its
socket and threw the oval cover off the dis-
charge chamber of the s cylinder poked
into the cylinder from the front end and
forced one shell out he slipped the faked
shell into its place snapped the oval throw-
out cover over the chamber it was in raised
the trigger to half-cock twirled the cyl-
inder until the faked shell was the one just
before the hanimefcso that when the gun
was next cocked jhe faked shell would
move into pi	to be discharged he

sighed with satisfaction that a man feels
upon completing a nerve-tense job let the
guns hammer down softly holstered the
gun at the beds head and then softly
opened a drawer in his rough box-trunk in a
corner of the room he took out a fresh
box of ss and opened them abstracted
six shells and placed them  the outspread
paper he got soap from the washstand
then a pencil sitting down he proceeded
tp shave up the soap then to knead it be-i
tween his powerful fingers and thumbs 
soon he had it like putty he split the pen-
cil deftly with a penknife and got the lead
out of it he shredded the soft lead until
it was powder-black soft he kneaded
that into the soap and soon had a leadlike
fairly hard mass

  then barney took the six shells and
worked the bullet from each he kept the
powder in the shells and wadding it tight
midnight of the ranges



with a little paper proceeded to mold on
top of each shell the semblance of a time-
dulled  ball from the lead-tinted soap
when he was satisfied he had six apparently
good s that were only blank cartridges in
reality	

  smiling evilly barney took the six fake
shells and wrapped them in a bit of paper
he pouched the discarded balls the empty
 shell the residue of the leaded soap
and then he sat down on the beds edge
finally he got up took them all up again
and went to a corner of the room wheeled
the washstand aside as carefully as possi-
ble and reaching behind it thrust the lit-
tle parcel into a cranny there he rolled
the washstand back then grinning went
to bed again

  he intended to do away with the evi-
dences of his manufacture of those fake
shells later but now he meant to sleep and
soundly for no one but himself knew of
that hiding-place he thought to himself
congratulatory-wise just before somnolence
claimed him fully

 we get peters-to-day

y rant to see you in th front room
vv barneys father said crisply as
soon as the son had shown him-
self smiling easeful about the ranch-yard
the next morning he winked mysteriously

  barney followed in the office he found
weaver and maltrane waiting the elder
barnquist locked the door and the four
gathered about the rough desk

   im goin on a hunch that peters will
be back in coppered jack he informed
them  were goin in to-day an get
peters

   hell be back to swell around after
runnin you off the street maltrane said
his cold eye glinting

   yes i suspect so i heard him saying
earlier yesterday that he might be back to
get fencin an staples to put up some wire
hes been braggin about putting around
his two springs

   les go over th program again
weaver suggested

  you do it barney you made up the
scheme barnquist said flatteringly

   its easy enough but ive thought of
an amendment now get it right we get
peters inside on the chance of a drink be-
tween him and i and pap you two be
in the back room weaver and you pop out
together weaver fires mai here he has
peters covered as peters wheels mai who
never misses plugs him dead center cold
turkey weaver keeps pumping lead each
of his s nicked and one of them goes
in th pile o wet rags barnum mops th bar
with dad lets off his gun once or twice
we swop guns weavers for peterss when
the crowd comes bulging in paps just
plump had to shoot peters because the
ornery cuss picked a fight after we made
up an the nicked-nose balls from weavers
gun proves that he didnt shoot straight
because pap plugged him first and he shot
his wad wild all over th room now for
my improvement when th break comes
to make sure ill grab peterss gun arm-

   you wouldnt have th guts

  his fathers voice came sneering across
the boards at him

   now dont nag pop you watch an
see

   you pull that pup now hear me talkin
an ill give you some real cash money
to spend-as much as-five dollars haw
haw

  barney hung his head in humiliation at
being thus bantered before even the hire-
lings he noted their scornful smiles his
mouth grew hard he got up and flung out

  the three continued to talk in low tones
perfecting their plan barney outside
went toward the bunk-house he strolled
along seemingly careless at the doorway
leading to lars maltranes room he paused
and glanced about no one was watch-
ing he went in quickly and found mais
holster on its peg it was there because at
home there would be no need for the guns
use as a rule the young man drew out
the gun from the holster it was a new
model he put the throw-out open flicked
out the six good s he fed the faked
ones that he got out of his pocket where
he had been carrying them carefully
wrapped into the weapon then carefully


all-story weekly

closed the throw-out again he put the
gun into its holster fumbled until he found
a match in one of maltranes coat pockets
and came out ostentatiously lighting the
cigarette he got out with the match so if
seen it would be thought he merely had
strolled inside to get a match then he
went quietly toward the office again

  he came in to find the three at ease
the door open as if plots and plotting were
farthest from their minds

   youre just in time pup the elder
barnquist growled  les go boys les go
and get peters to-day my hunch is that
hell be in

  the four clumped out soon they were
mounted and galloping toward the main
trail as they flashed past the ranch-house
a white form leaned from the window of
barneys room fluttering a good-by with
a dust-rag

   that lil injun gals a dustin your room
pup barnquist leered  you ought to
have pleasant dreams if she hangs around
your room like that

  barney only scowled he was moody all
the way in

  at the wagon yard barnquists query
yielded results peters the yard-man said
was in-with his buckboard

  what d i tell you the elder barn-
quist said aside to the three  les go get
him

  they went out on the street few people
were about the day was young a mex-
ican dog or two skulked about between
the houses sniffing for bones a burro off
somewhere in the spaces back of the row
of buildings brayed the sun brilliant
beamed down two men crossed the street
farther up close to the thimble belt
saloon of parley brown

   one of those is nicked-nose peters
lars maltrane said

   and the other barney asked

   seems familiar wteaver champed on
his pipestem emitting a blurb of smoke

   its that cussed range rider from ver-
non that threw his gun down on to me
ystday barneys father growled

  just then they saw the range rider start
back from the saloon toward the coppered
jack emporium

   hes goin back to th store for some-
thin an that lets us get to peters when hes
alone urged barney  come on

  he started forward

   cussed if th pup isnt gettin brave
his father sneered tailing after his eager
son the other two trod after their master
toward peters who in front of the saloon
was whistling

       its a long lope to chihuahua

but a longer one to yuba dam

  as they came up he saw them at a dis-
tance and dropped his hand to pistol butt
as if casually men who saw their attitudes
edged back into doorways or between build-
ings expectant of dazzling gun-play

   we come to make it up peters barn-
quist called now in the lead  come on
in an have a hoot in parley browns joint
what say

  the watchers faces showed their disap-
pointment over the outcome
moved they were all smilingfari warn
peterss hand came from his guns bfitl-
the smile of a good-naturett if sometimes
hasty man overspread his face

   you mean youre not lookin tor trou-
ble he asked

   sure and barnquist stuck out his fist
friendly invitingly

   well ill call it off then and peters
met his clasp  we gotta live neighbors-
like barnquist i dont want no trouble
you got your plans bout that irrigation
ditch an th water i wont cross them
all i want is to be let alone on my little
holdins with my gal bernice

   thats a right peters warmly  say
les all go into th joint and hoot one to-
gether eh

   all right barnquist and peters
glanced over toward the emporium  i
gotta watch for a friend o mine hell be
out in a minute

   come on in an have a hoot now
when he comes we cn have another
young barney urged

  peters wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand he glanced at the emporium
again no burlane was appearing

    jus a hoot together to show were all
friends urged barnquist bluff hearty
midnight of the ranges



     all right les make it a good one and
peters turned at barnquists side they
stepped through the open portal the other
three closed in after the two elder men who
were chatting friendly-wise barnquist
called ahead

   five o th best bamum lively now
presently the emporiums door opened
burlane came out and looked toward where
he had left his new-found friend he came
across the street glancing up and down

  u seen peters he asked of a man lean-
ing against a near by doorway

   just went in there he answered point-
ing to the saloons open portal  with th
two barnquists an mai an weaver

  ed turned to enter his face was cloud-
ed with anxiety he could hear peterss
voice noisy protestations of friendship that
to eds ears had the ring of insincerity in
them he swung the door when the man
to whom he had spoken called

   hey mister th emporiums clerks
yellin at you

  ed turned back the clerk met him
half-way and corrected an error in change
that ed had not noticed thanking the
clerk burlane turned toward the saloons
door again

  as he did so he heard the sharp crack of
a 

  plunging forward hand on gun-butt ed
hurtled into the midst of dim swirling
chaos blended with flashes of flame

  this is what ed burlane saw

  the head of barn urn just emerging from
behind the bar back of which he evidently
had been crouching during the battle par-
ley brown in a far corner moaned his
head laid open from the impact of some
hard object against the side wall was bar-
ney barnquist hands and arms folded
smoke eddying about him his face sardonic
his eyes fixed upon something crumpled in
the far corner behind the partition leading
to the next room a hurricane of human
wrath was venting itself ed plunged in
there guns ready as he sped he had a
vision of a gun on the floor before the bar
but he disregarded that

  he flung himself into the writhing mass
on the floor-and found peters on top he
bawled into his ear

   	a-s

   hell-a-mile peters what is it let
up its burlane

  peters panting surged upright the two
men under him were groaning their
empty guns were on the floor the table
the chairs were broken the room a general
wreck

  ed swung his guns to cover the prostrate
ones as he edged peters out into the main
room that by now was filling up with a swirl
of eagerly inquisitive men and by now
young barnquist was at the side of the
crumpled form on the floor weaver his
pipe missing maltrane his hard eyes
daunted from glaring at the ends of eds
steady guns came out obeying orders from
the range rider

   now what is it all about ed de-
manded dominating the situation

   i charge that man with killing my
father after my father had made up with
him publicly in full view of the town
barney barnquist said pointing to peters
 we come in here peacefully to have a
drink t seal our new frienship he turned
ori my father and shot him down my two
friends weaver and maltrane tried to
overpower him-

   wtiynt they use th guns thats on th
floor inside then ed demanded

   he was too quick-jumped em with
fists

   you bet i jumped them peters blared
indiscreetly  i hearn guns a barkin be-
hind me to my side i reached for mine
it was gone some skunk had twitched it
out o my belt at th first crack i jumped
for th shooters jus as they emptied their
weepons i sailed into em with fists and
feet and teeth and claws-

   you lie peters you shot my father
and started that side row to cover it up
barney was erect now the picture of out-
raged young manhood

  ed holstered his guns with twin snaps of
supple wrists he strode to the prostrate
form and felt for the heart

   hes dead he announced and threw
back the vest and shirt the breast so
exposed was not bloody ihe bleeding
had taken place internally

  he examined the bullet hole intently a
second while the people held their breaths


all-story weekly

   thats queer and he felt in the vest
pocket and drew out a few cigarette papers
in there he examined them pocketed
them and stood erect

   nothing queer about it barney de-
nounced  peters here killed my father i
accuse him-

   you lie peters thundered

   no i saw you shoot him-

   it is queer then ed said distinctly
his hands dropped to his guns butts again
 mighty queer that a charge from a good
tight  like peters has should throw a bul-
let keyholed end over end instead of
straight rotating on its axis as a well-sent
ball should go from a good tight  inside
this short range isnt it

  barney scowled thrusting his face for-
ward bending across his fathers body to
do it

   what are you saying he demanded

   just this kid and ed pointed to the
breast of the dead  see where the ball
went in tearing an oblong hole not mak-
ing a nice round drilled one ive got
cigarette papers that ive taken from this
dead mans upper left-hand vest pocket and
they are in the line of the balls flight
they too are cut not pierced with a round
hole blit cut keyhole like

  the people stared at the bared breast of
the dead at the tense faces of the two
living that accused and denied in turn

   ill stay in town till sheriff harvison
comes young-timer peters broke the ten-
sion  you needn ta be fraid for me i
got friends here a few ill train with
them you ride out home an tell th gal
whats up

   im with you all the way through on
this old-timer ed said warmly  well
go down the trail with this and well go
clean through

chapter vi

cold guns-and hot

as ed dropped peterss hand he thought
of something he brushed through
the increasing crowd in the barroom
and sought for the gun he had seen on the
floor as he had leaped into the rear room

to get at the center of the human whirl-
wind he found it kicked into a corner by
careless feet he grabbed it then snapped
behind the partition to pick up the two
empty weapons on the floor there he
brought them out his acts had been fol-
lowed closely by several pairs of keen eyes
as ed wished them to be he laid the three
guns down the bar and called

   hey peters one  these is yours
which is it

   that one and peterss stubby fore-
finger indicated his own gun

  burlane felt of it then passed it over to
an open-faced good-humored-seeming cop-
pered jack man

   i call on you neighbor he said  to
see that this weapons cold-fully load-
ed-

   hold on there the coppered jackian
objected  its cold but theres one shell
exploded spinning the cylinder so he
could make sure

 yas ones exploded i killed a hen-
hawk out to my place this morning wen i
was down to get the hosses to hitch to th
buckboard you heard me shoot burlane
 yes i heard you shoot-

   wtiynt you put out th spent shell an
a new one in then objected young barn-
quist striding over to the bar

  thats it why not several of the
coppered jack storekeepers demanded the
barnquist money and influence was making
itself felt

   i was in a hurry-an i wasnt countin
on no rookus in town peters replied
 leavin my gun so carelesslike shows i
wasnt after war

   an ef you was nicked-nose the
man who had the gun said heartily  youd
ony needed one shot i dont believe peters
shot barnquist

 thanks wickson peters said slowly
 you dont horn in on this wickson
barney barnquist scowled at the new pro-
tagonist of the accused  theres still a
barnquist alive-

   youll chaw a lot o beef before youre
as hefty as your dad wickson flashed
back

  there was a hum of talk at this thrust
young barneys cringing demeanor toward
midnight of

his father was well known he felt that he
had not proved himself yet and that some-
thing was needed to set him up in the eyes
f the hard-bitten men with whom he had
to deal and over whom he meant to reign
as his father had the huddled hap in the
corner already was passing from his cun-
ning ambition-spurred mind there never
had been affection between father and son
and the fact that his father was dead did
not grieve him enough to overshadow the
possibilities of his new position

    now these two guns burlane cut in
 with shoving the  and  along the bar
 to wickson who picked them up after pass-
 ing peterss gun to another man  look
 at and feel of these two each of them is
 hot-mighty hot all empty

   yes hot empty wickson began
screwing one brown eye at the end of each
cylinder in turn as he twirled them ham-
mers half up  and a dirtier gun i never
saw than this holding up the 

    smeared with something all in between
 chamber and barrel butt and blacker n a
 bay skunk his neighbor informed the
 highly interested crowd

    this is youm lars maltrane wick-
son demanded

    yes and maltrane stepped forward
 its mine an poorer shoo tin i never done
when peters began to pump at th boss i
opened on him an i fired six times an
never hit a thing

    thats as fishy a story as ever was
told mai peters bellowed his fist going
under the others nose  you thats
counted th best in this end  san felic
firin six times at me short range an miss-
in ever time you tell that to some ten-
der foot an hear him laugh

    then theres that other hot gun bur-
 lane suggested

    weavers peters declared  we or-
 dered our guns mail order same day
 they cum together

    yes i shot my wad too before peters
 came in to us weaver admitted

  another good shot fires six times at
 me close range-an misses six times-
 peters glared at them at the crowd
 men began to take sides to whisper pro
 and con burlane strode over to where the

the ranges	

dead man was and bent over to come up
with barnquists gun

   dead coldhe informed them he
laid that gun too on the bar where sev-
eral verified his words by feeling of the
weapon of the deceased cattle baron

   barkeep barlane demanded of bar-
num  wheres your gun

  bamum reached under the bar got it
and slid it along to join the others

   dead cold all loaded burlane judged
feeling of the gun he glanced about seek-
ing for some one else then he called

   wtieres th joints boss whats his
name

   brown parley brown and the sa-
loons proprietor came to the center of the
crowd

   oh yes youre the man  saw on th
floor like youd been knocked out as i
came belchin in burlane inquired

   yes hes that same man peters said
he got in my way when i started with
bare hands toward those two in th other
room that were shoo tin tord me when i
turned in at th first crack out o th box
he got in my way i give him one lick-
jus one

   never mind that ed said shortly
 les see your gun too mr gin seller

   yes show it several in the crowd
commanded

  brown unholstered his gun and laid it
with the others

   cold all chambers full not been shot
since last cleaned ed decided the
weapon a new bright one showed for it-
self at a glance what burlane had stated

   now burlane called  wheres your
gun barnquist

  he glanced about as did several others
barnquist was not at the bar in the shift-
ing back and forth of people looking at the
guns and the actors in the drama called to
the center of the stage he had disappeared
 hey barney barnquist-

  it was lars maltrane

   here i am and the young heir to
ox bow came in from the street  whats
wanted o me

   les see your gun burlane demanded
 put it right on th bar where all cop-
pered jack cn see it


all-story weekly

   oh yes and he unholstered it and
laid it down  i didnt think youd want
my gun but here it is a  side-throw-
out pap was killed with a 

   how do you know burlane cut in
like a flash

   why th hole in him-

   it takes a mighty good eye to tell
th difference between a  hole and a 
hole in a mans skin-

  oh noa  is bigger ever way-
tears a bigger hole-

   not when th bullet keyholes a 
would tear a bad hole thataway

  burlane snapped up bamquists gun

   warm not hot he said quietly  all
chambers full looks clean-but its about
as warm as it would be after ten minutes
an after one chamber had been fired

   yes its warm i half drew it when
you came in guns bulgin an have had my
hand on th butt finger on trigger thumb
over hammer most o th time since after
you turned your back an began to argufy
bout this affair that nacherallv would
warm up th gun some

   yes some ed agreed

   an what d i want to shoot my pap
for-

   no ones said you did-yet

  burlanes face was thrust out his jaw
set his eyes met those of his adversary

   an for a man thats just lost a good
dad youre displayin mighty little interest
in his remains ed finished

   you talk like a lawyer barney replied
steadily glancing about with an injured air

 we barnquists dont sputter about family
affection a whole lot pap hes dead im
interested now in gettin his killer hanged
this was a clever shot an explanation of
his conduct that coppered jack would un-
derstand many men murmured approval
hearing this barney next did just the right
thing from his standpoint he walked to the
corpse and bent over it with a show of rough
affection

 help me to lay him out boys he
pleaded  when i went outside it was to
send a rider on a hell-bent lope to harvi-
son the sheriff he ought to make it-and
to be continued next week dont

back-by sundown help me to get pap
offn th floor an on to th bar so t th
sheriff and coroner can view him

  burlane and peters were among those
who helped the truce was tacitly ac-
cepted as being in operation pending the ar-
rival of harvison and the coroner so
many volunteered that young barnquist did
not even touch the body in the ordered con-
fusion of the ministry of pity he sat
down heavily the picture of filial grief
peters went over and extended his hand
 you here barney he began  i
dont know who or what kilt your pop
him an me had our hash words we made
up an come in here for our drinks together
les not have any bad blood-

 you git away from me barney
snarled pushing aside the proffered hand
 you shot him cold turkey how mai an
weaver cum to miss you i dont know
you git away

  peters turned to the crowd

   im on th limits boys he safd  i
wont quit town till this is cleared up you
know me an my words good runnin
away would be th foolest thing i cd do
anyways my guns in evidence on th
bar ill stick round here till harvison and
th coroner comes

   an ill ride out to your place at twin
springs ed burlane announced  and
break th news to berenice

   thanks young-timer tell her to do th
best she cn till im with her again

  burlane shook peterss hand again and
went out wickson spoke up

   peters you come with us well be re-
sponsible for you you can eat and if
needed put up at my house to-night

   thanks wick ill go you iii stay in-
side th town an meet all comers on this
they linked arms and went out a half-
dozen grim gaunt old men followed the
younger element glimpsing the far-off
benefits from the new heirs opening reign
remained to offer encouragement and sym-
pathy to barnquist who received both with
just the right degree of interest and rather
bored affability to catch the public regard
adding a subtle touch of manly sorrow

rt he first of c j cutcliffe hynes series of stories detailing the adventures of
  teach pirate de luxe was printed in the all-story weekly issue
of may  one will appear in each of our issues throughout the summer months
while each story is complete in itself all are concerned with the adventures of
that likable blackguard captain teach-descendent of the notorious pirate
blackbeard-and charming mary arncliffe

v-the desert isle annexation

the gun-fire apparently sprung out of
the empty sea

before the mist came on the ugly
screw-pile lighthouses which marked the
coast of florida were clearly visible grow-
ing apparently out of the sea and there
were the patches of bubbly yellow weed
and the bits of wreckage and the other
flotsam that the warm gulf stream always
carried with it on its journey to the north

  excepting for these and a frve-masted
schooner with a heavy deckboard with
yankee written all over from her gaff-top-
sail halyard-blocks downward the evil-
smelling steamship saratoga and her people
had that section of the florida channel
to themselves but undoubtedly shells were
being fired out of the fog from somewhere
at somebody

  the fog fk first had been a thing of
wreaths and whorls but out of nowhere
and-apparently-nothing these had fat-
tened apace till the sunny twinkle of the

blue water was obliterated by a scum of
what looked like cotton wool but then
the scum grew upward

  once or twice they saw spits of fire that
stabbed through the fog but for most part
the gun-fire was only indicated by the sharp
crack of the propellant explosive and the
yell of the bursting shell

  if that dum war hadnt ended said
his chief officer to captain o p crump k i
should say there was a hun submarine oper-
ating in this section as things are i give
it up

   thats useful of you i wish to gee i
was past hatteras always have bad luck
in the florida channel bumped into a
whale last trip hit a sponge-boat full of
bahama darkies trip before

   id never be surprised if the tropic of
cancer didnt get adrift and tangle my pro-
peller-hellup whats that six points
starboard quartermaster

   that  was a six-inch shell which burst




all-story weekly

squarely against one of the foredeck
winches and emitted a tornado of whistling
steel

   hully gee remarked captain o p
crump to his chief officer  this is getting
worse n baseball for danger to spectators
ill have to have that citizen fined unless
he grows more careful with his shooting

   just step down to the wireless-room
mr olsen and call up creation and tell
them the tale say were frightened and
lunch is getting cold oddstash it that fel-
ler yonder must think hes in the balkan
states by the gay manners hes showing
gee-gee heres mr sparks himself at-
tacked by spasms

  the wireless-operator white-faced clam-
bered onto the high upper-bridge he
handed a scribbled message captain crump
read

  have got your range nicely stop engines or
will blow you to glory

   there was a signature the wireless-
operator added  but somebody jambed me
and i couldnt take it

  gee gee gee commented cap-
tain crump  reads like a dime novel

    if that war was still on his chief officer
suggested  i should guess there was a
fritz submarine somewhere in that fog
but as the wars over it cant be

   youll never make a corner in being
helpful mr olsen said his superior sourly
 gee whiz-pelt theres another of the
blighted shells shaking the point offn my
smoke-stack

   say you sparks get busy and ask
our unknown correspondent for name and
address say-hellup theres another
shell scraping the counter-say i am ready
to talk sense on business lines there
away with you and get that on the ether
and ill give vou some more-yes mr
olsen

   i was just thinking said that officer
after a pause  this sort of thing ought not
to be allowed its like the old florida
channel pirate yarns we used to read about
as kids its out of date its enough to
make a party that could write send a letter
to the new york herald

   youll have a mental breakdown said

his captain viciously  if you use up gray
matter at your present rate hell a splin-
ter from that last one has smashed my arm
ring off engines mr olsen and see if that
will soothe him

    engines stopped said the chief officer
reporting the obvious  but if it had been
me i should have wanted to know a bit
more about the party that was talking be-
fore i did what he said i believe i told
you capn that that wars ended now good
and real-

   if you dont get off this bridge in two
twinkles said captain o p crump  ill
tear up a stanchion and brain you-you-
you scandinavian decimal whilst youre
away just drown yourself ill send a
wreath

  once more the wireless-operator clam-
bered up on to the bridge his face was
livid with paleness

   ive got the name of the gentleman
who sent that last message sir it was the
great captain teach sir himself

   why  great sparks my lad and
how do you guarantee the  himself  you
havent seen him through your receiver
have you by any chance gee i didnt
know wireless had got to that pitch 

   and he says sir youve got to go
through the hole in the wall or hell sink
the ship and drown the lot of us that
means were all going to be murdered
n-no man could t-take a steamer through
a h-h-hole in a wall

   quit trembling you blithering coward
the hole in the wall is the passage out
of the florida channel south of abaco in
the bahamas outside is about the emptiest
spot in all the western ocean except may-
be some fancy bits of the arctic

   here you pull your shaking wits to-
gether was that all the message

  you are to report course sir and dis-
tance run every five minutes by wireless
you are to steam ten knots exactly if
you make a mistake of so much as a foot
hell sink us without further notice oh
lord sir you will be careful

   get off my bridge you miserable shiv-
erer

   yes sir but theres a bit more yet
sir

   hully gee get out the lot or ill
strangle yqu with the one arm ive got left
 he says sir if youll give him thirty
thousand dollars united states currency or
its value in jewels hell let us go oh sir
do jfty up and get us off that diamond
tie-pin you wear to go ashore in would fetch
half the money

    well if it deceives your eye it is better
than i thought hut its a dud all the same
sparks my lad and worth a matter of cents
the chart-house cash-drawer contains in
hard money seventy-three dollars and ten
cents i know because i wanted to buy a
hundred-dollar chronometer from another
captain in tampico and was shy on the
cash we must just go out where captain
teach orders and take our gruel

  captain crump took a glance at the
chart spoke to the engine-room through the
voice-tube and gave his quartermaster a
course that would take the odoriferous sara-
toga to the hole in the wall

   now then sparks get away to your
instruments and see if you can pick up any
more news

 would the owners sir repay that thirty
thousand dollars if any one on board ad-
vanced it so as to buy off captain teach
crump gritted his teeth at the pain in his
arm and looked at the man queerly

  -  has your blue funk made you go
balmy sparks

   sane as ever i was sir its a plain
lmsiness proposition ive got in mind sir
if that thirty thousand was advanced and
the saratoga ransomed would the owners
repay the money with perhaps reasonable
interest

   its a bit of a problem they do not
part easily

    would you give a writing sir that they
would have to pay if the money was
found

  captain o p crump somewhat painfully
lit a cigarette with his one hand and won-
dered if there was some method at the baok
of the wireless-operators madness

 if it will please your unknown banker
and annoy the owners i will give a lien on
the ship in consideration of the advance
ive got it in for those blighted owners any-
way by gee for sending me to sea with

this load of stinking hides how do you
want it worded

   may  write it out sir seeing youve a
hurt arm ill just scribble it on this sig-
nal-pad if youll sign there sir will
that do

   you will see i have made it out as for
cash or value to the extent of thirty thous-
sand dollars united states currency ad-
vanced for ransom of steamship saratoga
from the pirate teach

  the captain wrote his hard-outlined  o
p crump master at the foot of the pad
and handed back the stylograph  its
rather taking you for granted on ahead my
lad as that is a receipt for moneys actually
advanced however if you dont advance
them i take it you and i and the document
wont show up in any court this side of
new jerusalem now then wheres the
cash if you have any

   well sir its stored away in a couple
of bales of those hides just under no 
hatch you see sir my name at birth
wasnt j howard pakenham

   looking at your dial i never thought
it was

   no sir i couldnt alter that but a
name like pakenham is a lot more comfor-
table to wear in new york these days than
pilliamobski

   you bet agreed captain crump

   so i changed it my old man didnt
you see he speaik mighty little except yid-
dish so it would hardly have done but
hes a born merchant and hes been using
his talent wav down in mexico

   he took good united states gold coin
with him and i guess a mighty little of that
goes a heap long way among those insur-
rectoes way back behind tampico i dont
rightly know which political party he fav-
ored the old man has mighty strong opin-
ions-till he changes them but i guess he
thought the same way as any mex patriot
who had some jewels he wanted to realize
on

   i get on to you captain crump ad-
mitted  and as pop pobbleobski hadn t
any spare capital left over to lavish on the
customs house of his adopted country he
just detailed off his bright and true ameri-
can son r howard whatever-it-was to

run the goods through for him inside some
of my stinking hides

   i wish pop may use a pair of them as
blankets till he croaks you young swine
dont you know i draw commission on
freight how much have you done me out
of youll square up for this dodge of
yours or-

  swish-br-r-room

  another shell burst with a roar just clear
of the saratogas forefoot and raised a
waterspout into which she drove and
emerged streaming

   here get back to your instruments my
clever boy and tell your pirate chief that
we guessed wrong the time before and what
were hankering after now is to pay pay
pay ask him to be polite enough to give us
the name of his bankers and who the
checks to be made out to

  captain crump grabbed at one of the
wireless-operators ears with his available
hand and wrung it savagely  you let me
down again over this stunt young feller
my lad and ill have that ear on my watch-
chain now get busy 

  late that afternoon the steamship sara-
toga smelling venomously brought-to off
a certain desolate bahama cay as directed
and proceeded to lower a boat as captain
o p crump had not got an officer he
could trust and as he emphatically dis-
trusted that astute financier his wireless-
operator he took an inventory of the thirty
thousand dollars worth of jewels and
wrote alongside it weights as ascertained
from his letter-scales

  he went in the well-manned boat him-
self coasted for a while till he saw an oar
stuck upright in the sand and there landed
he made sure that the name e teach was
branded on the oar deposited the tin cash-
box containing his ships ransom at the
foot of it got back into the boat and pulled
off to his odoriferous ship

  captain o p crump had every prospect
of losing his employment and possibly his
left arm he would most assuredly be a
butt for every newspaper in christendom
and most of the journals in germany but
he carried a stout heart and whistled cheer-
ily-if somewhat out of tune-as he steered

the quarter-boat to the vapors which hung
round the saratogas gangway

  he was still to windward of the work-
house by the value of one large solitaire dia-
mond scarf-pin which was by no means the
u dud  he had described it as but a por-
table asset which represented his lifes sav-
ings the eye of mr howard pilliamobski
had not been in error but the wits of that
oriental expert had been bluffed by the cold
new england yankee

  after all a sound knowledge of poker
is a great part of education and the
florida channel did not bring him complete
bad luck every time

  i have given this episode of the unfra-
grant saratoga in somewhat full detail be-
cause it is a very good average specimen of
the work done by the crew of the five-mast-
ed schooner james walter cockerham

  teach captured her with the littondale
as it seemed to his crew out of sheer wan-
tonness what possible use could he have
for a schooner-load of lumber one man
questioned him on the matter omitted the
formal  sir  in his inquiry and was shot
for his pains and hove overboard

  teach dug a gun-pit among the lumber
instaled therein one of the  i-inch weapons
he had weighed from the hun steamboat he
sank off lanzerote added a frugal supply
of ammunition and called for volunteers

  to his annoyance there was distinctly
no rush his pirates had their qualifica-
tions they were docile-if there was a
steady automatic always to windward-
they were plucky they did not ask incon-
venient questions after they had discovered
that curiosity was frequently fatal but
they distinctly lacked initiative

  so the volunteers volunteered because
they were picked by captain teach and
because they had an internal feeling that if
they did not smile and look gratified at his
choice worse would befall them

  furthermore to prevent their turning
honest and surrendering to the powers of
civilization with a full supply of informa-
tion as to their captains recent doings
captain teach chose only those members
of his crew who had a bad criminal record

  how he got his details about these men
teach pirate de luxe



i do not know but he got them as he
got most tilings he set his mind to

  in command of this pleasing cohort was
one titherby puncheon who once had sailed
a yacht of his own he was a man who
had shirked service in the war and-toy
way of getting out of the frying-pan into the
fire-had joined teach to avoid the con-
scription he had imagined himself fright-
ened when a sea-fight presented itself he
showed a face of brass and the pluck of a
terrier

  as i say he went in command and as
it turned out could not do a days work in
navigation and never developed the least
talent in gunnery a little london pick-
pocket by process of elimination made him-
self the james walter cockerhams gunnery
officer and-as has been instanced above
in the case of the saratoga-some remark-
ably bad markmanship he exhibited

  one way and another during her brief
span of activity in the florida channel the
james walter cockerham accounted for five
ships from the saratoga and the het and
libby she extracted ransom the robert
weatheral which either would not or coum
not understand her demands she sank
and the edith rickards and the dorothy
k she sent off to a rendezvous in one of the
quiet places in the outer sea which will be
spoken about later

  at the end of this period of usefulness
came disaster two of the james walter
cockerhams victims did not know who was
either firing at them or sending such un-
pleasant messages by wireless the other
two did and they spread the news

  half a dozen united states destroyers
converging from various points arranged
the rest they took no prisoners tither-
by puncheon and his merry men like oth-
ers of their ilk had no taste whatever for
a hanging

  so they fought it out in style and the
unsinkable james walter cockerham was
a very expensive prize by the time the
united states navy had captured her

  in the meanwhile both the aromatic
saratoga-as recorded above-and the het
and libby-which being log-wood laden
had a tropical odor of her own-as i say
paid ransoms

  the point of payment on the track-chart
before me is marked by a mere dot the
sailing directions say  there are several
small unnamed sand cays between these
points navigation among them should
not be attempted without local knowledge
they are uninhabited are without water
and are frequented by sea-fowl and turtle in
season one of them was said to contain a
treasure buried by the notorious pirate
blackbeard this has not been authenti-
cated though several attempts have been
made to discover it

  i have often wondered if this choice of
the neighborhood of his grandfathers cache
for his own deposit was a matter of chance
on the part of our teach or calculation i
have no definite evidence on the matter and
shrink as a rule from guessing

  but when one remembers the millions of
isles of the sea the choice of this desolate
bahama cay goes beyond coincidence
there was a vein of romance in the man
intensely practical though he thought him-
self to be and undoubtedly a pride of an-
cestry one always recalls the affectionate
way he gazed on sir godfrey knellers
 blackbeard  which hung on his cabin
wall

  it is not of course every man who would
care to boast that his great grandfather
was not hanged in  because providently
he  went out fighting but then of
course one must carry in mind that all of
us are not equal to the fatigue of tracing
our pedigrees back so far at all

  teach the first was the crude product of
his times all the world over there were
far more coins stowed away in stockings
than deposited in banks in  teach of
 invested his loot in first-class securi-
ties as often as opportunity offered and
every scoundrel of his following had a com-
fortable bundle of script in various acces-
sible hiding-places

  wives parents and sweethearts came in
for the golden shower and the eight wives
of mr william pickles the stout gunner
all found themselves in possession of such
glittering incomes that they promptly-and
somewhat unwisely it seems-withdrew the
unpleasant legal proceedings which led their
william to resign his petty officership in

the british navy and sent him to sea under
the skull and bones

  owing to the exigencies of the piratical
profession it was not every day that the in-
vestment market of the year  was open
to captain teach and so he was forced
much against his will to make temporary
accumulations on board the littondale and
elsewhere as he recognized that the lit-
londale in her pursuit of duty ran certain
business risks he did not overstock her with
valuables

  he had various other depots afloat of
which more will be said later he had one
place of deposit-at that date-on land

  chart and sailing directions as i have
said leave the isle anonymous our teach
called it tortuga cav he may have got
this name from his great-grandfather but
 have an idea that he invented it through
sheer piratical sentiment

  anyway tortuga merely means turtle
and as the isle was turtle-shaped and was
the egging-place of turtles it was a perfect-
ly legitimate piece of onomatopoeia this
particular member of the order of reptilia
is supposed to murmur the word tortn-ga
every time it lays an egg but my egg-col-
lecting friend is away in sheffield so i do
not guarantee this

  xow miss mary arncliffe as has been
recorded before had taken up residence on
one of these sand cays and had settled
down as a householder she subsisted on a
diet of baked eggs and tepid water with an
occasional tasty chocolate when these
sweetmeats first were delivered at her door
she tried one on a lady seagull to test it for
poison but observing no evil effects kept
the rest rigorously for home consumption

  water was her main anxiety the supply
in the galvanized tank ebbed and the art of
well-sinking in the sand was beyond her
so when a derelict ships life-boat blew
ashore she was very naturally seized with
the itch for exploration

  the life-boat carried a full equipment
of masts sails filled water-breakers and so
on and in her stem-lockers a notable sup-
ply of tinned provisions evidences showed
that she had been burst violently from
her davits by shell-fire and here mary saw

the dark signature of captain edward
teach but the seas were large and seemed
desolate and mary had some amateur
knowledge of boat-sailing

  with trouble she got the foremast stepped
and the lug ranged ready for hoisting the
boat a heavy cumbersome thing had
grounded at about half ebb and the young
flood was making she took a boat-anchor
and line and waded out with these till she
was chin-deep and dropped them the
boat strained on this line -when the water
lifted her and was soon afloat

  she shipped her rudder mastheaded the
lug got her anchor sheeted home the flap-
ping sail and felt the thrill of gathering
speed her personal luggage consisted of
a pair of clocked silk stockings and some
gold-brocaded shoes with three-inch heels

  there were at least six cays in sight to
choose from all turtle-backed all dull to
the eye and equally unattractive with the
six-to-one chance against such a coincidence
 prefer to think that it was pate which
led her to the teach familys tortuga

  yes i am sure it must have been some-
thing more than bald chance because tor-
tuga lay dead to windward and all women
sailors have a constitutional hatred for a
hard beat

  however there are the facts and you
may diagnose them as you choose the
boat was a dull sailer and sagged heavily
to leeward both of which are habits of
lifc-boats as many a war-wrecked crew will
testify it was on the edge of dark when
mary rounded her to in a bay of sand
dropped the lug and dumped her anchor
into still blue water

  sea-fowl creaked above the curve of the
isle and at intervals made grating comment
upon the affairs of the universe and it was
probably due to some hint from these that
man advanced with caution she was a
slim athletic young figure clad largely-
say it with a blush-in white satin knicker-
bockers and a crepe de chine camisole
the remains of her lilac-sprigged organdy
muslin had been garnered from a hundred
thistles by thrifty herring-gulls and used for
the lining of nests

  her face and neck and arms and legs
were burned to a fine mulatto color and her
teach pirate de luxe



black hair was-she felt-deplorable you
cannot keep even bobbed black hair in con-
dition without at least a comb toward the
crown of the isle she dropped to her knees
and crawled

  mary had no definite reason for this
stalk when her heart commenced to
thump she told herself indignantly that it
was absurd to be frightened on a desert
island and anyway she had only come for
wrater and could do no harm to anybody

  but-well she made her advance with
every possible caution and when finally
she put her head through the final tuft of
grasses at the top of the dune she was climb-
ing there in the edge of the sea at the
further side was a well-manned boat pulling
off and a steamer lying to the offing

  marys heart renewed its thumping with
vigor

  teach she instantly jumped to the con-
clusion was here the brute as a matter
of fact the steamer was the logwrood-laden
het and libby above mentioned and hated
the name of teach every bit as much as
mary did but that she could not know
and so watched the boat go alongside and
get hauled up and carried off into the sea
and the night

  the cool darkness brought back her
pluck also curiosity was mightily strong
within her what on earth was captain
teach doing here

  she couldnt guess but if he had any
plan connected with the isle that she could
upset she wanted to be up and busy so
she scrambled to her feet and ran down
to the place where the boat had landed

  here stuck into the yellow beach was
an oar branded e teach at its foot were
two boxes an assortment of old-fashioned
jewelry was in the one-dull-looking stones
in obsolete settings the other was packed
with crisp sheaves of hundred-dollar united
states notes a third of a kindly moon and
a few million southern stars showed these
clearly she stooped and tucked the boxes
under her arms and then turned and stum-
bled back across the breadth of the isle to
her boat

  she dumped her plunder on board
climbed after it weighed her anchor and
poled the boat out of the gap in the sands

in which it was embayed then she hoisted
the lugsail and betook herself to the tiller

  she would not go to the island she had
left teach knew about that and might
come to look for her there no she would
go to that other island over to the westward
there where the lone palm-tree showed up
against the sky she had a feeling in her
bones that somebody must come there to
take her off in the course of the next day
or at the very outside the day after that

  and then her glance somehow traveled to
the stern-sheets grating and there close to
her feet was a parcel that she was certain
had not been there before

  with twittering fingers she opened it
good heavens chocolates nervously
she turned the box about under the moon-
light looking for something she dreaded

  yes there it was

  you see how i remember your tastes my
dear

  as you are going through your wardrobe so
quickly why not come to me for some more

  there was no signature and none was
needed mary chilled all over as she read
and then blushed hotly the brute he
must have been on that very island she had
just left well anyway she was sailing
away with his plunder

  in the meanwhile captain edward teach
was lighting a fire under the politicians of
great britain and the united states

  he sent his first signed message to the
press and the press of all countries pub-
lished it greedily he wrote

   the world seems to have conspired to call me
a pirate i am nothing of the kind i am in
supreme command of the navy of the irish re-
public in the name of ireland i warn the
navies of the other powers to let me go about
my countrys affairs without interference

who were running things-and drawing the
corresponding salaries-at the moment

preceding chapters briefly retold

when mary wayne reduced by the sudden death of her father to earning her own living
applied at the brain workers exchange for a high-class position she discovered in hort
order that skill efficiency and respectability were all useless without the employers fetish
references and as she had yet to fill her first position she had none

    turning sadly away she met another girl nell norcross who being fortunately abundantly
supplied with the great essential had just secured a particularly fine position with miss caroline
marshall of an old and conservative family on lower fifth avenue nell taking pity on mary
insisted on taking her to lunch and when later she nell was taken ill and it became evident that
it would be weeks before she would be able to work she persuaded mary to lake her job and
incidentally her name and references

    mary did so and easily got the position but discovered to her dismay that it was not with
miss marshall personally but as social secretary to her huge and vigorous nephew bill marshall
a young man just out of college who abhorred society but was being forced into it by his rich
aunt to maintain  the position of the family bills position was peculiar his aunt stood in
the place of mother and guardian to him and he was her only natural heir but their ideas for
his career were diametrically opposed also things were complicated by the fact that bill had
brought home a college friend pete stearns a practical joker of great genius who being of a
family that miss marshall regarded much as a mountaineer regards a revenuer had insisted as
posing as bills valet and who further insisted upon giving bill a most enviable reputation to his
aunt as a student and generally model young man likewise respectfully suggesting methods
by which bill might easily break into the loathed society

    in his extremity bill partially explained matters to his new secretary trying to make an ally
of her but was again interrupted by the irrepressible pete with more suggestions and during
the mix-up that followed mary or miss norcross as she was of course now known disappeared
not however on account of bills language as he feared but to see miss marshall she wanted
to get hold of an idea before everything went amiss she never needed an idea so badly in her life

chapter vi

in search of an idea

bill hunted for his valet with com-
mendable industry he searched his
own rooms the servants quarters
and every part of the house where pete by
any possibility might be concealed he
went out to the stable and garage he
made inquiries among the maids but he
did not find pete which was an excellent
turn of fortune for that young man bill
was more than angry he was primed for
conflict

   ill stand anything within reason he
told himself  but if pete stearns thinks
he can ruin me offhand hes got to lick me
first

  he gloomed around in his room until it
was time for luncheon and went down-
stairs to find aunt caroline and mary al-
ready at the table bill held them both
under suspicion as he took his seat he
glanced from one to the other searching
for some sign that would betray a conspir-
acy but aunt caroline appeared to be
her usual placid self while mary wayne
neither avoided his glance nor sought to

meet it nor did she in any wise behave as
might a young woman who had guilt on
her soul

  bill ate stoically curiosity was burn-
ing within him he wanted to know what
pete steams had been saying to aunt caro-
line but he feared to ask somewhere
there was a flaw in his moral courage
whenever he was in the presence of his
aunt

  he really had a morbid desire to know
the worst but lacked the hardihood to
seek the knowledge boldly so for a while
there was nothing but perfunctory conver-
sation between aunt caroline and the so-
cial secretary with bill affecting preoccu-
pation but listening to every word

   miss norcross tells me you have been
discussing plans william said his aunt
suddenly turning the talk

   huh oh yes certainly

  he directed a sharp glance at mary but
it did not reveal to him anything that sug-
gested an uneasy conscience

   i am glad that you are losing no time
continued aunt caroline  have you de-
cided on anything definite

   why - nothings positively settled
aunt caroline takes time to get started
you know its a sort of a closed season
in society anyhow isnt that so miss
norcross

   it is not as active as it might be-in
town said mary diplomatically

   i suppose it is true observed aunt
caroline  yet of course opportunities
can be found i had what seemed a really
excellent suggestion this morning

  bill laid his fork on his plate and waited
grimly

   it came from that nice young man of
yours peter

  the social secretary was diligently but-
tering a piece of toast she did not appear
to be interested bill knew what that
meant-aunt caroline had already told
her everybody was taking t a hand in
planning his career except himself it was
enough to make a red-blooded american
explode

   well ill bite aunt caroline wtiat
did he say

   william please avoid slang why he

spoke about the social possibilities that lie
in charitable and religious work

  bill gripped the edge of the table and
held on he felt certain that his brain had
flopped clear over and was now wrong side
up

   what he had in mind continued aunt
caroline  was killing two birds with one
stone it would give you an opportunity
to combine society with other worthy enter-
prises as i myself know there are many
people of very fine standing who are inter-
ested in the various religious and charitable
organizations while the extent of peters
knowledge of the matter really surprised
me through the medium of such organi-
zations he assured me that it would be pos-
sible for you to meet some of the most
socially desirable families of course you
would also meet other persons whom it is
not so important for you to know but that
is a detail which would regulate itself at
the same time you would have an oppor-
tunity to do some morally uplifting work
bill moistened his lips and stole a horri-
fied glance at mary wayne this time she
was stirring her tea

   well william what do you think of
the idea

   preposterous

  aunt caroline was frankly surprised

   absolute nonsense drivel

   william

   well it is its nothing but sancti-
monious bunk

   now william control yourself con-
sider for a moment-

   aunt caroline i cant consider it
gee whiz if ive got to go into society im
not going to use the family entrance im
going in through the swinging doors or i
dont go in at all and id like to know
what business my valet has butting into my
affairs

  aunt caroline displayed a mild frown of
disapproval

   you must remember william that he
is something more than a valet he has
been a companion in college and is a young
man of very high ideals

   i dont care what his ideals are-high
up or low down let him mind his own
business


all-story weekly

    but william he has your very best in-
 terests at heart persisted aunt caroline
  i consider him a very fine influence

    well he cant meddle with me

    nobody is meddling william we are
all trying to help you-miss norcross
peter mysel f-everybody 

    say whos trying to run me anyhow
 what is this-a league of nations or
 what

    william 

   but bill was becoming reckless the
more he heard of this diabolical plot the
more he was determined to wipe pete
stearns summarily out of his life how
many were there in this scheme he
glared accusingly at his secretary

   this time she met his glance steadily
 there was something so purposeful in her
 gaze that it held his attention her gray
 eyes seemed to be telegraphing but he
 could not read the message she flashed
 a side glance toward aunt caroline writh
 no apparent purpose she lifted her napkin
 but instead of putting it to her lips she
 laid her finger across them

   bill raged so they had dragged her
into the plot too her part it seemed
was to put a soft pedal on protests

   im not going to be charitable and im
 not going to be religious said bill defi-
 antly i and if you dont lay off me im
 not going into society either id sooner
 go to the devil all by myself if i have to
  william marshall 

   bill was not looking to see how much
aunt caroline was shocked he was again
looking at his secretary her finger went
to her lips once more and this time she
also shook her head she was slightly
frowning too well what was the idea
what difference did it make to her whether
he spoke his mind or kept a craven silence
probably she was afraid of losing her job

    society jeered bill  personally con-
 ducted by my valet me-hopping around
 in a pair of patent-leather pumps lugging
 lemonade for a lot of giggling boneheads
 and saying  aint it great 

   aunt caroline was passing the point
where her sensibilities were merely out-
raged she was growing angry her fingers
were drumming nervously on the cloth and

 in her eyes was an expression that bill had
 seen there before but this time he seemed

to miss it mary wayne did not miss it
however she sent him a frown of warn-
ing and then she spoke

   miss marshall wouldnt it be a good
idea if your nephew and i discussed this
matter up-stairs

  aunt caroline sternly regarded bill and
hesitated bill began bracing himself for
combat

   i think perhaps he doesnt fully under-
stand tfie idea continued mary hastily
 perhaps there are some features of it that
can be-modified id like to have a
chance to explain it to him more fully
aunt caroline arose from the table

   very well she said  but you
neednt go up-stairs to discuss it my dear
you can discuss it right here that is if
you are able to talk to him at all which
 am not

  she walked stiffly out of the dining-room
leaving mary and bill facing each other
from opposite sides of the table

   well demanded bill

  she leaned forward and regarded him
with complete disapproval

   you nearly spoiled every tiling she
said  ob please-please cant you be
more reasonable mr marshall

   reasonable do you call that stuff
reason

   i havent called it anything but
dont you see that it only makes these
things worse to quarrel about them

   you didnt even want to give me a
chance to defend myself accused bill
 you tried to shut me up

   i was trying to warn you to be more
diplomatic

   whats the sense of being diplomatic
when somebody sticks you up with a gun
thats what it was it was a stick-up
mary made a patient gesture of dissent
 i dont think you handled it in the
right way at all she said firmly  you
didnt accomplish anything except to offend
your aunt

  well im not going to stand for it
anyhow so what was the use of pussy-
footing youre all against me-the whole
three of you

 mary studied iiim for several seconds

  whose secretary am i she demanded
  why-mine that is youre supposed
 to be

  well am i or am i not

  of if it comes to that you are he
 said it reluctantly and suspiciously

  very well then whose interests do i
 look after

 bill hesitated he was by no means cer-
 tain on that point

  youre supposed to look after mine i
 should say

  im not only supposed to but i do
 declared mary  and i dont think that
 thus far you have any good reason to doubt
 it i dont think its fair for you to doubt
 it

 bill was beginning to feel uneasy it
 would be very embarrassing if she started
 to scold him

  im not doubting it he said but none
 too graciously

  all right then said mary  as your
 secretary i am looking after your interests
 first of all in this matter

  but youve got a wrong idea of my in-
 terests miss norcross theyve got you
 in on this scheme and-

  who said i was in on it she inter-
 rupted

  but arent you

  i am not

 bill stared incredulously

   but youre in favor of it anyhow

  i am not

 he spent a few seconds trying to grasp
 that

  youre against it on the level he
 gasped

  on the level she said calmly

  then why in blazes didnt you say so
 he cried

  because it wasnt the time or the place
 to say so mr marshall

 he was rubbing his ear in a puzzled way
  does my aunt caroline know youre
 against it

  i think net we merely discussed it
 i didnt express any opinion

 bill rose and took a turn about the room
 he stretched comfortably he was breath-
 ing normally again

  gee he exclaimed im glad they
havent got you hooked up on it but you
certainly had me guessing for a while
mary was smiling faintly as she watched
him

   you stick by me and ill stick by you
he said walking back to the table well
put rollers under aunt caroline yet

   oh no mr marshall remember
you promised to make a beginning

   well well put that valet on skids
anyhow

  mary pursed her lips and considered

   he has a certain ingenuity she re-
marked judicially

   what

   i think so and when you come to
think of it there are really possibilities in
his idea

   oh glory and you just told me you
were against it

   i am-in your case said mary  but
that doesnt condemn the idea it simply
means it might not work in a particular
instance

   i take it you couldnt quite see me
breaking in from the religious angle

   not quite she answered and bill
thought her emphasis was unnecessary
but he did not dwell upon the matter of
emphasis because he was still overwhelmed
with gratitude at the discovery that she did
not belong to the cabal that had been or-
ganized against him

   you see explained mary  i did not
take any side in the matter because i felt
it was necessary first to find out what you
thought about it but you ought not to
have been so emphatic i havent been here
very long of course but i have already
learned that that is not the best way to
deal with your aunt mr marshall

  bill was studying his secretary with new
respect he knew that she spoke the truth
about aunt caroline but he had never been
able to put into practise the best method
of dealing with her

   i think we can let the matter rest for
a while she added  although of course
it depends a good deal on whether we can
make progress in some other direction its
imperative to make a start

   keep me out of the charitable and re-


all-story weekly

ligious game and ill leave it all to you
said bill fervently  but listen dont
start in with the idea that that valet is any
friend of mine hes dangerous

   then why do you keep him mr mar-
shall

  why oh im-well im sorry for
him you know and i knew him in col-
lege which makes it hard to turn him
down he sticks around in spite of me

  to mary wayne this explanation did not
cover the situation peter the valet im-
pressed her as a somewhat mysterious re-
tainer in the marshall household but she
did not press her inquiry instead she
asked bill if it would be convenient for her
to leave the house for a couple of hours
that afternoon as she had an errand to per-
form bill assured her that it would he
volunteered to drive her wherever she
wanted to go an offer that mary declined
with prim and hasty thanks

  not long after that she was sitting at
the bedside of nell norcross the sick
girl regarded her with feverishly bright
eyes

   i mustnt disturb you of course said
mary  but the doctor says it is all right
for you to talk a little i need some ad-
vice

   what about asked nell

   about how to get a young man into
society when he doesnt want to get there
a rather violent young man im afraid

   a man

   i didnt explain to you last night did
i you were too sick well tll tell you
what has happened

  mary sketched the affair as briefly as
she could nell norcross rightful owner
of the magnificent references showed
flashes of interest but for the most part
she lapsed into listlessness her head still
ached and the medicine that she took every
two hours tasted frightfully

   now what would you do with a young
man like that asked mary

   i-i dont know tll have to think
nell turned wearily on the pillow and
closed her eyes  i-im afraid i cant
think now

   any suggestion might help said
mary encouragingly

  nelt groaned and aske for a drink of
water mary fetched it and again sat by
the bedside

   just a single idea as a starter she
urged

   oh give a party answered nell irri-
tably  they all do that

   wthat kind of a party

   oh any kind i-oh im so tired

   never mind said mary soothingly
 im sorry my dear i wont bother you
now perhaps i can think- she paused
as an inspiration came to her  i know
what ill do ill call up one of your refer-
ences on the telephone and explain that i
need a little advice

  nell turned quickly and stared at her

   oh no she muttered  you shouldnt
do that

  but dont you see-	

  nell was shaking her head then groan-
ing with the pain it caused her

   very bad form she managed to say
 its never done

  mary subsided into a perplexed silence
if it was bad form of course she would not
do it she must be scrupulous about mat-
ters of form more than ever she felt her-
self a neophyte in the social universe she
knew neither its creed nor its ritual

   all right i wont do it my dear
there now dont worry the doctor says
youre going to come out all right but it
will take a little time

   youve-youve got to hold the job
whispered nell

   of course ill hold it ill manage to
get along theyre paying me very liber-
ally and its all yours every cent you
see living there i can get along quite a
while without any money of my own i
dont even need to buy any clothes just
yet we can afford a nurse for you i
think

  but nell shook her head stubbornly
she did not want a nurse all she wanted
was to be mt alone

  mary was saying good-by wrhen some-
thing else occurred to her

   its just one question she explained
 in case i should be asked about it again
i ought to know and im really curious
on my own account although it isnt any

 of my business what is it that they say
 about mrs rokeby-joness daughter
 nell stared at her dully

    the elder daughter added mary

   nell was shaking her head again and
reaching for the glass of water

   is it really something-awful

    yes-awful faltered nell  i-oh
please-

    i wont say another word declared
mary hastily but there was a note of dis-
appointment in her voice  if i should
be asked again ill give the same answer i
did before

    what was that mumbled the voice
from the bed

      said i didnt care to discuss it

 i  thats-best  never did either

    and i said that personally i never be-
 lieved it

   nell answered with a gesture of dismissal
 and mary left her as she descended the
 dark staircase of the boarding house she
 shook her bead as if dissatisfied about
 something

    im just as curious as aunt caroline
 she thought u i ought to be ashamed of
 myself but just the same id like to
 know what it is that they say-and some
 day im going to find out

chapter vti

via the night court

matters were not getting ahead to
suit the liking of mary aunt
caroline was displaying mild symp-
toms of impatience because the ship that
represented bills society career still hung
on the launching ways bill himself would
pay no attention to the business of getting
it off he was never at home at night and
it seemed to mary that he slept very late
in the mornings pete stearns wras also
missing from the household nearly every
time that bill disappeared he was prob-
ably taking covert advantage of his em-
ployers absences mary thought

 thus she was left very much to her own
 devices save for occasions when she found
 it advisable to consult aunt caroline in
 the case of the latter mary observed a
  a-s

threatening tendency to revert to the
launching plans that had been conceived
by pete whenever she found opportunity
she tried to impress upon bill the fact that
unless he helped to devise something else
he would find himself forced to follow the
charitable and religious route into society
but he waved ail that aside in the most
optimistic fashion

   you take care of it he said  youre
against it yourself im counting on you

  the valet still puzzled mary he had
an annoying way of appearing when bill
was not around always ostensibly looking
for bill and always lingering when he did
not find him she could not deny that he
interested her he possessed an element of
the mysterious whereas bill was as trans-
parent as air it was not easy to establish
the precise status of pete aunt caroline
contributed to that difficulty by lending
him a willing ear on any subject to which
he chose to devote his fluent tongue his
rank was that of a domestic servant he
even ate with the servants which was
something of which he bitterly complained
to mary she could not help feeling that
there was some merit in the complaint

  yet she could not and would not accept
him on a plane of social equality although
she did not wish to appear snobbish the
relative values of their positions in the
household must be preserved if only for
the sake of discipline she would not have
minded an occasional chat with her em-
ployers valet if he did not constantly con-
vey the idea that he was about to step out
of his character he never actually pre-
sumed upon her friendliness but he always
made her feel that he was about to pre-
sume

  she had a sense of something like es-
pionage whenever pete was about coupled
with an idea that he viewed her work with
suspicion and even derision certainly the
impression that he made upon mary was
quite different from that upon aunt caro-
line he never talked theology to mary
although to aunt caroline he would dis-
course upon it until the dear old lady ac-
tually became sleepy

  as for affairs between bill and pete
there had been a truce ever since the


all-story weekly

former threatened to throw his valet out of
the house by way of the skylight if he
dared to discuss any more social projects
with aunt caroline they did very well
together so long as it was not necessary
for them to play the parts of master and
man for the benefit of the household it
was on those occasions that the ever-lurk-
ing devil within pete stearns took charge
of his actions and speech outside of the
house of course all barriers between them
were down-and they were outside a great
deal

  it was late in the evening of a difficult
and dissatisfying day that mary sat alone
in the library quite vainly trying to scheme
something practical for the social launching
of bill the only thing that cheered her
was a faint hope that he would bring home
an idea of his own for he had told her that
he was to spend the evening at a private
and very exclusive affair aunt caroline
had gone to bed early as usual and even
the valet had disappeared

   i do hope ill be able to do something
very soon mused mary frowning at a
book she had been trying to read  poor
nell shes too sick to help and even in
her bright moments she doesnt seem to
want to talk about it i never dreamed it
could be so difficult its not fair either
i came here to be a secretary and theyre
trying to make me a manager and he
simply wont be managed and-and i dont
know how to manage him even if he
would

    ps-s-s-st 

  mary jumped half out of her chair as
she looked up and saw the valet standing
in the doorway

   please make a noise when you walk
or knock or do something she said
sharply you startled me

  pete made a gesture for silence stepped
into the room andswiftly surveyed it

   where is aunt-where is miss mar-
shall he whispered

   she went to bed long ago

 good come on then we need help
who needs help demanded mary
impressed more by the mystery of his
manner than by his words  whats the
matter

  the boss is in the hoosegow answered
 pete his voice tragic

 	what

  mr marshall-hes in jail

 mary leaped to her feet nd stared with
 incredulity

 in jail what for how

  caught in a raid come on weve got
 to hurry

  how horrible exclaimed mary  is
 he hurt

  only in his feelings said the valet
  get your hat youre needed

  but-where do you want me to go
 what can i do

  bail him out get him home we
 cant let his aunt know about it can we
 weve got to produce him at breakfast
 havent we

 mary felt appalled and helpless

  but how can  bail him she asked
  i havent any property or any money
 or-

  ill put you wise to the ropes said
 the theological valet in a hurried voice
  come on arent you willing to help
  of course i am said mary indig-
 nantly  ill be ready in a jiffy

 when she came down-stairs again pete
 was waiting at the front door which he
 closed gently behind them in front of
 the house stood a taxi into which he thrust
 her with much haste following himself
 after he spoke an order to the driver

  where are we going asked mary as
 the taxi gathered speed

  jefferson market-its a police court
 she could not repress a shiver

  you said a raid what-what kind
  listen said pete  now this is what
 happened the boss went to a scrap-a
 prize-fight

 mary sitting in the darkness of the taxi
 compressed her lips he had made her be-
 lieve that he was going into society

  fights are against the law in this
 state continued the valet  while it
 was going on somebody told the police
 and the police came and among others
 they got the boss he got stuck in the
 window that was too small for him

  oh gasped mary

  theyll be taking him to the night-

 court by the time we get there and weve
 got to bail him out

   how

  we get a bondsman therell be one
of em there ive got it arranged hes
in the business professional bondsman
you know only he wont put up a bond
on my say-so im only the valet you
understand it takes somebody higher up
like a secretary well get it across all
right if you put up a good front got
any money with you

   a little said mary  about twenty
dollars i think

  k thatll help with what ive got weve
got to give this bird some cash down
mary was bracing herself as rigidly as
she could in a corner of the seat it was
difficult to prevent a rising tide of indig-
nation from overwhelming her although
she realized it was a time to keep her head
of course there was but one thing to do-
get bill marshall out of jail but after
that she felt that she would be entitled to
a reckoning how awful it was her em-
ployer-her social climber- her debutante
-in jail after a raid on a prize-light

  at jefferson market she was hustled out
of the taxi across the sidewalk and up
some steps that led to a badlv-lighted cor-
ridor

   wait here ill get him whispered
pete

  mary shrank herself as small as possible
against a wall and waited the valet was
not long in returning with him was a
middle-aged stout red-faced person who
swiftly inspected mary with a piercing pair
of eyes

   this the dame he asked in a casual
tone	

  mary stiffened at the question

   this is the lady i told you about
said pete then addressing mary  this
is the gentleman who is going to bail mr
marshall

   dont travel too fast said the bonds-
man  maybe  am and maybe im not
who are you anyhow

  he was looking at mary with another
critical glance her cheeks had become
red by this time to pete he seemed to be
growing taller

  u i am secretary to mr william mar-
shall she said  my name is miss nor-
cross and i do not wish to be addressed
in the manner that you now assume
there was a flash of dismay in petes
eyes to be succeeded by one of admiration
as for the bondsman he stared for several
seconds in a sort of dull surprise

   oh no offense he said  got any-
thing to identify you

  mary opened her bag and drew forth
some letters which she handed to pete
she would not permit this creature to re-
ceive them from her own hand he seemed
to sense the import of this employment of
an intermediary for he surveyed her once
more this time with what was obviously
a more respectful curiosity then he be-
gan reading the letters

  even a professional bondsman is per-
mitted to have knowledge of the upper
world and this one w-as not wholly ignorant
of names in the social register his eye-
brows w-ent up as he read and mary was
once more made aware of the potent magic
of references she continued to grow
taller when he made a move to return
the letters she indicated that he was to
hand them to the valet which he did

   i guess it  be right he said  the
bond  be for a thousand the prisoner
himself is good for it but i got to have
additional security ill want you to see
the prisoner when hes arranged and if he
aint the right one tip me off and 
take fifty bucks now

  mary brought forth what she had and
handed it to pete he played up to the
situation by palming his own resources as
he received marys contribution and then
began counting off bills that were appar-
ently all supplied by her the bondsman
pocketed the money

   sign here he said producing a paper
from his pocket

  mary received the paper from pete ami
examined it for all she understood of its
contents it might have been printed in
chinese but nowhere did it mention bill
marshall it dealt with a defendant
named  henry smith she was being
swindled

   give me a proper paper she said


all-story weekly

sharply this has nothing to do with
mr marshall

  the bondsman grinned and pete made
the explanation

   thats the name he gave on the police
blotter its all right maam

  so mary produced a fountain pen and
signed dimly aware that she was probably
committing one of the varied degrees of
forgery when she had finished it ap-
peared nowhere that mary wayne was go-
ing to the rescue of one william marshall
but rather that nell norcross had under-
taken to guarantee a bond that would open
the jail doors for henry smith

   now well go up to court said the
bondsman and he led the way

  mary had never been in a court before
much less a night court which is peculiar
to itself in atmosphere and characters
she slipped into a place on a rear bench
anxious now to lose something of that stat-
ure she had attained during her interview
in the corridor the bondsman and pete
went forward and stepped inside a railing

  mary waited and watched the judge
who sat behind a high desk was yawning
two persons whom she took to be clerks
were fumbling over papers there were
several policemen in uniform on the
benches about her were numerous and for
the most part unpleasant persons

  two women were led through a side
door evidently to be  arranged as the
bondsman said they seemed at ease a
policeman said something the judge said
something the clerks did something and
they passed on still in custody then
came a man who followed the same rou-
tine then another woman

  and then out of the side door which was
constantly guarded by a policeman came
several men-and among them bill mar-
shall towering almost proudly it seemed
to mary she listened breathlessly but
could not hear a word everybody was
talking in low tones all she knew was
that bill was standing in front of the
judge and evidently unashamed pete and
the bondsman were there too and pres-
ently the group moved over to the clerks
desk

  this it seemed to mary was a critical

instant she knew that they must be ex-
amining the bond she felt as though she
too ought to be standing there with bill
marshall a defendant at the bar a sense
of guilt was overwhelming her if anybody-
had touched her on the shoulder she would
have screamed and then it was over in
a most perfunctory and undramatic man-
ner  henry smith  was not returning
to the place beyond the side door but was
passing through the swinging gate that led
to the space reserved for benches his
valet was at his heels the bondsman
showed no further interest in them he
stayed inside the rail where he chatted
with a policeman

  up the center isle came bill swinging
along jauntily as he neared the bench
on which she sat mary became aware that
a young man who had been occupying a
place beside her was as much interested in
bill as herself this person suddenly
sprang into the aisle gripped bills hand
and then linked arms with him together
they passed out of the court-room

  mary too had arisen and now the valet
was beckoning to her she followed him
out beyond the swinging doors there in
the corridor she observed bill marshall in
one of his intimate and happy moments
he was laughing with a wholesome lack of
restraint and was slapping on the shoulder
one of the most ill-favored persons that
mary had ever seen this was the young
man who had joined bill in the moment of
his triumphal exit

  he wras not over five feet six but he
was somewhat broader in the shoulders
than most youths of that stature his
clothes seemed too tight for him although
they were not a misfit but rather the
product of a tailor who must have received
his inspiration from a brass band his
skin was swarthy his dark eyes small and
bright his nose appeared to have under-
gone a flattening process in addition to
which it displayed a marked tendency to
point to the left one of his ears mary
observed with particular attention it had
been twisted into a knotty lump and stood
out from his head in an aggressive effort
at self-advertisement it was not within
marys province to know that this was a

singularly perfect specimen of cauliflower

or  tin ear

   oh its all right now bill the young
man was saying  oply if youd a took
my tip an follered me you wouldnt a
been pinched at all gee i had n easy
getaway

    you always did have speed kid re-
marked bill  oh well its nothing in
our young lives where do we go from
here wheres pete

  he glanced around and beheld not only
pete but mary wayne

  bill slowly flushed a fiery red and his
eyes widened to almost twice their size
he faltered for an instant then rushed
forward

  u miss norcross why what in thun-
der-

    had to bring her sir said pete
hastily dropping into character u they
wouldnt accept me as additional security
sir

  bill hesitated the cool gaze of his
secretary upset him far more than if she
had flung scorn in her glance

   oh im awfully sorry he began  i
wouldnt have had you come here for all
the w-orld it isnt right its a shame
why- peter how dared you bring miss
norcross to this place no dont try to
make any excuses you ought to be
thrashed for it

   your valet was not to blame in the
least degree said mary in a frosty tone
 it appears that it was necessary for me
to come

   yes sir echoed pete

   i dont care stormed bill  its no
place for her i wont have it id sooner
lose a leg than have miss norcross come
here

  but in his soul he was really not so much
disturbed over the fact that she visited a
police court as he was over her discovery
of bill marshall as a prisoner at the bar
although he was not at the time capable
of analyzing his emotions very accurately
he was ashamed confused angry at the
presence of mary wayne whereas but a
moment before he was enjoying the relish
of an adventure and a joke

   shall i get a taxi sir inquired pete

   ml get it myself wait here miss
norcross

  anything to escape even for a moment
from the level gaze of those accusing eyes
he dashed down a staircase followed by
pete who had a word he wished to say in
private

  mary now observed that the young man
with the tin ear whom she had heard ad-
dressed as  kid  was watching her atten-
tively as her look settled upon him he
stepped forward swiftly tipped a derby
swiftly replaced it on his head and favored
her with a confident and confidential smile

   friend of bills it seems he observed
 well we had a nice evenin for it

    do not seem to know you said mary
  he stared in honest astonishment

   y dont know me he echoed
  a i do not

   y mean to say bill never told y about

me

   he never did-and i do not think  am
interested

  his small black eyes blinked at the
astounding news

   why im kid whaley evrybody
knows me bills my best friend wot
y never heard of kid whaley say are
y kiddin me why its only last week

i	put away battlin schwartz knocked
im dead in five rounds over in trenton
say dont y read the papers aw y
must ve heard of me sure y have why
im gonna be the next champ everybody
knows that an take it from me th champ
knows it too you ask bill hell tell y
right

  during this outburst of sincere protes-
tation mary stood stiffly where bill had left
her she would have preferred to walk
away but for the fear that this voluble
young man would follow her

   aw gwan he added as he playfully
poked a finger into her arm  youre
givin me a josh any friend o bills knows
me why hes crazy about me i aint
been inside th ropes once in a whole year
that bill didnt have a roll bet on me
why him an me-

  he paused for an instant as he sighted
the returning bill only to break forth

   hey bill get this heres a dame


all-story weekly

never heard o kid whaley whadda y
know about that an she says shes a
friend o yours

   shut up  snarled bill savagely

  kid whaley stared in bewilderment

   come miss norcross theres a taxi
waiting

  he seized her by the arm and urged
her rapidly toward the staircase mary
went willingly escape from the kid was
the immediate necessity

   hey bill y cornin back hey
bill-

  they lost the remainder of the kids
plea as they hurried toward the street

  fete stearns was standing guard over a
taxi as they emerged from jefferson market
and as he sighted them he flung the door
open mary permitted herself to be pro-
pelled into the vehicle with more force
than grace and bill followed pete was
about to make a third member of the party
when his benefactor placed a determined
hand against his breast and pushed him
half-way across the sidewalk then bill
leaned out shouted a direction at the driver
slammed the door and settled back with a
sigh prepared to receive whatever his social
secretary might decide was coming to him

chapter viii

   miss norcross gets the goods

as minutes passed the silence became
more than he could endure why
didnt she say something why
didnt she flay him alive and be done with
it he could stand that it would not be
pleasant of course yet it could be borne
but no she sat staring straight in front of
her wordless even oblivious

   oh say-go to it  he blurted

   i beg your pardon

   have it out hand it to me-mop me
up

  she turned to look at him briefly as they
passed a brightly lighted corner then re-
sumed her former pose

   well arent you going to he pleaded

   i dont know that there is anything for
me to say she answered

    yes there is youre full of it insisted

bill  i can tell by the way youre acting
 stand for it go on

   im not sure that i care to mr mar-
shall

  her voice was not frigid rather it merely
conveyed an idea of remoteness it was
as if she were at the other end of a thou-
sand miles of wire

   anyhow im sorry he said

  to mary that seemed to require no
answer

   mighty sorry miss norcross i
wouldnt have put you in that position for
anything i-i apologize

  but it appeared that she had again re-
tired into the silences

   oh be reasonable about it he said
in a begging tone  bawl me out and lets
have it over with thats the way aunt
caroline and i do it

   i am not your aunt caroline mr
marshall

   i know but youre thinking just
what she would think so it amounts to
the same thing please bawl me out

   i dont know that it is one of my duties
to do so observed mary  i think per-
haps we had better not discuss it at all
bill squirmed for the twentieth time the
air within the taxi was oppressive he
opened the window on his side with violent
hands

   well i apologized he reminded her
you might at least say whether you accept
it or reject it or what

   why i accept it she said  what
else is there to do

   you might have left off die last part
he grumbled  you dont have to accept
it unless you want to id sooner you
didnt

   but i already have

   well you neednt

   its done if you please

  bill felt peevish this was not a fair
way of punishing him

   if youre going to act that way ill
withdraw the apology he declared

  it is already accepted so it is too late
to withdraw anything mr marshall

  he was uncertain as to the soundness of
this position but it baffled him neverthe-
less
good references



  oh all right he agreed lamely  have
 it any way you like i-i suppose aunt
 caroline will raise the devil so ill get it
 good from somebody anyhow

  you will tell her about it then she
 asked

  who me do i act crazy

  then you will leave it to yotir valet
 perhaps suggested mary

 hill involuntarily tensed his shoulder-
 niuscles

  pete he doesnt dare id slaughter
 him

  then how is your aunt going to know
 mr marshall

    bill turned and stared down at her

  why- why you  tell her he ex-
 claimed

 it was marys turn to look upward at
 bill which she did steadily for several
 seconds

  once again mr marshall i ask you
 whose secretary am i

  miss norcross you mean-

  i mean that i do not peddle gossip
 she said sharply

 bill had seized her hand and was crushing
 it when she managed to withdraw ii her
 fingers were aching

  youre an ace he said joyously  i
 thought of course- 

  i do not think you had any business to
 believe  would tell said mary  if i
 have given you any cause to think so im
 not aware of it

  youre a whole first full of aces he
 declared fervently

 but mary had no intention of relinquish-
 ing any advantage that she held

  i think i have been quite frank with
 you mr marshall ever since  entered
 your employ and that is more than you
 have been with me

 huh hows that

 	have you forgotten what you told me
 this afternoon you-you said you were
 going to a very private affair-very exclu-
 sive you said

 bill managed to twist a smile

  so it was until -the police butted in

     assume of course it was social
 said mary coldly

  but i didnt say it was now did i

   you allowed me to infer it and that

is the worst way of deceiving people

   oh well   make an apology on that
too but if id told you the truth youd
have tried to stop me youd have roasted
me anyhow

    should have tried to persuade you not
to go she conceded

   sure i knew it and bill grinned
the taxi stopped in front of the marshall
home he helped her out paid the driver
and followed her up the steps his night-
key effected a noiseless entrance once
inside bill beckoned her to the library

  t i want to thank you for doing all you
did he said humbly  i feel awfully
mean about it

   about getting arrested

   no thats nothing about dragging
you to court it was a mighty square thing
for you to do im grateful-honestly

   i simply did it for business reasons
mr marshall

   business he repeated with a frown
of disappointment

   of course dont you see the point
  he shook his head

   its quite plain she said  my busi-
ness is to see that you enter society that
is the reason for my employment anything
that would interfere with that is naturally
also my concern if you participate in a
brutal prize-fight-

   oh wait i wasnt in the ring miss
norcross i was only looking on

   if you attend a brutal prize-fight she
corrected  and are arrested and the papers
are full of it and your aunt learns of it
what becomes of your chances to enter
society

   i see wbat youre driving at he said
slowly

   your chances would be nothing of
course and with your chances gone you
would have no need for a social secretary
therefore i would lose my position so
you will understand that i had a purely
business interest in the matter mr mar-
shall

  confound her she did not need to be
so emphatic about putting it on that basis
thought bill he was trying to make her
see that she had done something generous


all-story weekly

and fine but she stubbornly insisted on
having it otherwise

   well anyhow im much obliged he
repeated next time i wont bother to
send for bail

   next time

   certainly ill just stay in the lock-
up let the newspapers fill up on it and
then i wont be able to get into society if
i try thats not a bad idea come to
think of it much obliged

  if she insisted on being unpleasant about
this he would show her for the moment
bill was very much of a spoiled child

   well retorted mary  there aint
much danger of your ruining your social
career so long as you follow your-other-
career under a false name 

  bill glared  oh i guess youd do the
same thing if you got in a tight place
mary began to turn pale under the
freckles bill had startled her without
himself being aware of it he didnt
know he didnt suspect it was nothing
but an offhand and ill-tempered retort
but it awakened in mary something she
had been studiously endeavoring to forget
it had been flung so suddenly at her that
it sounded like an accusation

   take it from me he added  theres
many a sanctimonious high-brow in this
burg who sports an alias on the side ive
got plenty of company

  mary was seized with a fit of choking
that compelled her to turn her head she
was rapidly becoming confused she did
not dare trust herself to speech why she
might even forget her wrong name

  bill watched her for a moment then
shrugged and yawned

   well i guess ill call it a day miss
norcross you can give any reason you
like for what you did but im going to
keep on being much obliged his voice
had taken a more generous tone  youre
all right good night

  mary watched his exit from the library
a curious expression in her eyes then
suddenly she sat down and began to laugh
very quietly yet rocking back and forth
with the intensity of the attack

   oh what a job ive got was the bur-
den of marys thought

  she was in no hurry to go up-stairs to
her room and the reason for this was evi-
dent when she caught the faint sound of
the latchkey turning in the front door
which brought her to her feet and sent her
running softly into the hall she inter-
cepted the valet as he was about to make
a stealthy ascent of the staircase and mo-
tioned him into the library

   wheres the boss whispered pete

   he has gone up-stairs i want to talk
to you a moment

   yes miss

  mary looked at him sharply whenever
he addressed her in that manner she was
filled with a sensation of being mocked

   does mr marshall attend many prize-
fights she inquired

  pete clasped his hands and pursed his
lips

   well between you and me miss he
said after an instant of deliberation  im
afraid he attends about all there are

   has he ever been arrested before

   not that i can recall miss im quite
sure this is the first time since i have been
in his employ

   is he in the habit of associating with
pugilists

  pete sighed and hesitated

   if its just between us miss why ill
say that he has his friends among such
people its a very shocking thing ive
done my best to keep it away from his
aunt so far i think ive succeeded ive
tried very hard to persuade him to change
his ways ive labored with him ive
tried to get his mind turned to different
things

   theology suggested mary

   exactly answered the valet  but
its not an easy matter miss mr william
is very set in his ways

   but i thought you had told his aunt
that he was interested in higher things
to encourage her said pete glibly
 it was not what youd call a falsehood
there had been times when he seemed in-
terested but never for very long still
ive always had hopes his aunt is good
enough to believe that i have a desirable
influence over him i hope its true i
hope so
good references



  it always puzzled mary when the valet
pursued this strain and it puzzled her now
ninety-nine out of a hundred men who
talked thus she would have classed as hypo-
crites but pete did not seem to her to be
exactly that she viewed all his excellent
protestations askance yet she was not satis-
fied that hypocrisy was the true explana-
tion

   it seems a shame he continued  that
it was necessary to bring you into touch
with such an affair as to-nights i
wouldnt have thought of it if there had
been any other way i knew that you
would be very much shocked miss very
much surprised too

  he watched her so closely that mary
wondered if he really suspected the truth-
that she was neither quite so much shocked
nor surprised as both he and bill seemed
to believe that was her own secret and
she intended to guard it at all costs

   this affair of to-night she observed
 was it particularly brutal

  no  wouldnt say that replied pete
reflectively

   had it been going on very long

   not very long miss

  mary thought for a moment before she
framed the next question

   just an ordinary vulgar brawl between
two ruffians i take it

  pete unclasped his hands and made a
quick gesture of dissent

   not at all not at all why it was a
pip-

  he pulled himself up short and coughed
there was a gleam in marys gray eyes

   fortunately it had not progressed far
enough to become actually brutal said
pete and he showed for the first time since
she had known him a trace of confusion

   what were you doing there she de-
manded

  pete soothed out a wrinkle in the rug
with the toe of his shoe before he decided
to meet her glance

   it happened this way i knew where he
was going and i was trying to persuade
him to stay away you see his aunt ex-
pects a great deal of me miss and i didnt
want to do anything less than my duty
i followed him i argued with him in

fact we argued all the way to the place
where it was being held

  and pete was telling the literal truth
he and bill had argued heatedly bill
had stubbornly asserted that the harlem
holocaust would not last four rounds with
jimmy jenkins the tennessee wildcat
while it had been the contention of pete
that in less time than that the wildcat
would be converted into a human mop for
the purpose of removing the resin from the
floor of the ring

   failing to convert him i take it that
you went inside with him remarked mary

   exactly as a matter of loyalty of
course so long as there seemed to be any
chance i would not desert i am not the
kind miss who believes in faith without
works

  which was again true for pete had trans-
lated his faith in the harlem holocaust
into a wager that would have left him flat
had the contentions of bill reached a con-
firmation unfortunately the police had
canceled the bet

   and how is it that you were not ar-
rested as well as mr marshall

   there was much confusion wte be-
came separated i found myself running
i was carried along in the rush of the
crowd before i knew it i was in the
street again and besides-pete made a
gesture of appeal- it was necessary for
somebody to see about obtaining bail miss
norcross

   im sure it was very fortunate you
were there said mary  you seemed to
understand exactly what to do

  but pete declined to be further discon-
certed he was able to look at her with-
out flinching this time

   just one more question added mary
 is this mr whaley whom i saw at court
a particularly close friend of mr mar-
shalls

  pete drew a deep breath and launched
upon another speech

   it seems miss as nearly as i can learn
that for quite a long time the whaley per-
son has been known to mr william i
frequently took occasion-

  mary interrupted him with a gesture

   never mind she said  i under-


all-story weekly

stand you labored w ith him on that mat-
ter also  have no doubt that you prayed
with him and preached at him i am sure
you did everything in your power i wont
embarrass you by asking for the details
some day i feel certain your efforts to exert
a good influence over mr- marshall will
have better success

   thank you miss and pete bowed

   but meantime- and as mary leaned
forward her knuckles were tapping firmly
on the arm of the chair  meantime if
 may make a suggestion it would be an
excellent plan for you to remain away from
prize-fights

   yes miss

and it would be a very good thing for
mr marshall to do likewise-very good -
pete bowed again and made a note of
the fact that she had a significant way of
tightly closing her lips

   youre quite sure you understand

   ohr quite-quite

   kod night said mary

  dismissal was so abrupt that there was
nothing to do but accept it and pete was
not in the least sorry to terminate the in-
terview in spots he had enjoyed it but the
spots had been infrequent he was dissatis-
fied because he had never for an instant
been master of it talking to aunt caro-
line was easier than talking to bills secre-
tary who did not seem to place a proper
value on theology hang the business of
being a valet anyhow such were the re-
flections that crowded into his agile mind
as he bowed himself out

  he paused on the staircase to consider
the matter further the more he thought
about this interview with the social secre-
tary the more it disturbed him it had not
been a matter oi mere suggestions on her
part it was very like orders he recognized
a threat when he heard one even though
the threat might be veiled with ironical
advice

   confound her  muttered pete  that
little bird is wise-too wise i wouldnt
object to her simply getting the deadwood
on us if she seemed willing to let it go at
that but she served notice on me that she
might make use of it and i believe shed
do it if she once took it into her head

what samson did to the pillars of the tem-
ple isnt a marker to the house-wrecking
job she can do once she decides to get busy
at it

  up-stairs he opened the door to bills
apartments and thrust his head inside

   biu he called softly  shes got the
indian sign on us

   come in and shut the door growled a
voice  what did she say to you

  pete summarized the conversation that
had taken place in the library

   shes swinging a big stick he said in
conclusion  the worst of it is shes got
the goods it isnt me alone who is sup-
posed to stay away from prize fights its
you

   she cant dictate to me declared bilt
sourly

  u dont be too certain she can always
carry it up to the supreme court

   who aunt caroline bill considered
the suggestion  no i dont believe it i
dont think shes mean whatever else she
may be in fact she told me- he paused
it did not seem necessary to take pete en-
tirely into his confidence concerning con-
versations with his secretary  no pete
i dont believe shell say anything that
is-not this time

   maybe assented pete pessimistically
 i dont expect she will either but how
about the next time are you figuring to
reform

  bill made a scornful gesture of denial

   but she expects us to reform bilt
thats where the danger comes in and
shell be keeping her eye on us

   well i guess were as clever as she is
if it comes to that

   that so remarked pete  well im
not so sure if you think its going to be
easy to pull wool over the eyes of this sec-
retarial lady i want to go on record with a
dissenting opinion id just about as soon
try to slip a fake passport over on st
peter

   well im not going to be threatened
declared bill

   brave words lord and master only
it happens you are threatened

  mary sat for some time in the library

there were also brief periods when per-

smiling again

chapter ix

   miss norcross  wields a club

nell norcross-the real one-was
sitting up in bed unmistakably con-
valescent she had been listening to
the adventures of mary wayne not all of
the adventures for mary did not believe it
was wise to subject a patient to too much
excitement yet enough to convey the idea
that the introduction of bill marshall into
society was not an affair of mere toast and
tea

   i feel said mary  that at last im in
a position to accomplish something i feel
more established than i did at the begin-
ning

   more influential suggested nell

   exactly you see i have such strong
moral support from miss marshall

   and from this valet you speak about
nell reminded her

   im not so sure about him he puz-
zles me there was a calculating look in
marys eyes  he keeps telling me that
he wants to help but im always doubtful
as to just what he is really driving at but
he wont block me at any rate im able to
take care of that

   then everything looks quite simple
doesnt it

  no nell everything doesnt thats
the trouble im in a strategic position if
thats what youd call it but i dont know
how to take advantage of it

   then wait for an opening advised
nell  one is bound to come

  mary shook her head

   i cant afford to wait she said  i
could wait forever so far as mr marshall
is concerned but i can see that his aunt is
becoming impatient she thinks it is time
that something really began

 what does she suggest my dear

 nothing thats the worst of it she

leaves it all to me she is so confident that
i know everything there is to know about
such matters she wants me to go right
ahead with anything i decide upon and
if i ever express any doubt about what to
do first she begins talking about those won-
derful references of mine-yours-and says
that any young woman with such an experi-
ence is competent to take full charge with-
out suggestions from anybody and i dont
know how to start nell or what to do

   she is really impressed by the refer-
ences is she mused nell

   tremendously

   then its certain youve got to make

good

   oh absolutely so thats why ive
come to bother you

  nell was thoughtfully regarding a plate
of white grapes that lay on her lap

   so tell me how to start him off said
mary

   h-m lets see now i never launched
a man in society said nell wrinkling her
nose  i never was secretary to a man you
know i imagine they may be more difficult
than girls

   this one is affirmed mary with an
emphatic nod  hes so-so big for one
thing

   men are awfully awkward to handle
philosophized nell

   i didnt say he was awkward you mis-
understood me i merely said he was big
he thinks hes too big for society of
course he isnt at all he handles himself
very well

   can he dance

   he says not but im not sure

   why dont you try him out

   id rather not said mary hastily  i
dont think thats one of my duties

   anything is your duty that will get
him into society my dear

   we-e-ell possibly but were getting
off the track nell what am i to do with
him

   now if he was a girl debutante just
being introduced why- there its the
very thing for him give him a coming-out
party

 im afraid he wouldnt endure it said
mary  hes terribly afraid of being mis-


all-story weekly

taken for what he calls rollo boys if i
planned a coming out party hed probably
disappear for a month the very name
would make him explode

   dont call it by that name said nell
 dont call it any name particularly just
have a party at the house of course in-
vite all the nice people you can get hold of
lets see there ought to be some particular
reason for the party ive got it hes
about to make a tour of the world having
finished his studies at college this gives
him an opportunity to meet and entertain
his friends before he starts and also fur-
nishes something for everybody to talk
about

  mary nodded as she listened the idea
sounded promising but-

   who will we invite nell

   his friends of course

   im afraid his friends are not in so-
ciety sighed mary as the vision of a tin
ear flashed into her mind

   then his aunts friends she must know
a lot of society people

  u i dont think she has kept up her ac-
quaintances

   that wont make a particle of differ-
ence my dear miss caroline marshall
bears a name that will get her anywhere she
wants to go and it will do as much for
her nephew too its a key that will open
any society lock dont worry about that
why you could invite people that miss
marshall never met and nine out of ten of
them would jump at the chance give him
a party and it cant fail

   i really believe it can be done said
mary thoughtfully

   easiest thing in the world

  it will be a party then and now tell
me all about the details

  but when it came to details nell was
less satisfying she pleaded that she was
sleepy the doctor had told her she must
not talk too hn beside anybody could
work out the jetalls

   the main thing is the idea she said
with a careless gesture  ive given you
that all you have to do is to develop it
make him help you hell probably have a
let of suggestions of his own

   you havent met him declared mary

  u id like to he must be an extraordi-
nary character

   i never said so did i

   no but judging by the way youre
all fussed up over this thing-

   bosh said mary rising  im not a
bit fussed its as easy as anything

  but all the way back to the marshall
home mary was reflecting upon the difficul-
ties rather than the ease of the problem
the first thing to do was to obtain the con-
sent of bill marshall it would be no use
to consult aunt caroline that good lady
would simply tell her to go right ahead and
do exactly as she pleased she might of
course call upon aunt caroline to give bill
his orders in case he balked but that would
be a confession of her own weakness

   ive got to persuade him myself she
decided  even if it comes to being ruth-
less

  just as she had foreseen bill objected
strenuously and at once he did not want
a party he was not going around the
world but if she insisted on having a lot
of silly people at the house he would start
around the world before they arrived and
he would never come back mary argued
with much patience she even pointed out
the danger that his aunt might be driven
back upon the plan suggested by his valet
peter but bill was in a particularly ob-
durate mood faced at last with a definite
project he quailed

   well just let things drift a while he
told her

   no said mary

  bill grinned at her in an amiable way and
said he thought he would go out for a ride

   were going to settle it she declared
 you promised youd let me start

   but i never said when

   well this is the time mr marshall
well start now

  bill shook his head mary who faced
him across the table in the sun parlor
tapped a forefinger on the writing-pad and
looked him in the eye

   mr marshall she said  if you do
not consent i shall be compelled to go to
your bondsman withdraw from your bond
and advise him to surrender you to the
court
good references



  bill gasped he swallowed he stared
 and i shall do it this very afternoon
said mary

  it isnt fair he cried why you
agreed-

   i simply agreed not to say anything to
your aunt she reminded him coldly
 and i shall not of course but i am en-
tirely at liberty to go to your bondsman
if your aunt should happen to hear about
it when they come to arrest you again why
that would be unfortunate but it would
be something that could not be helped
bill rose from his chair and leaned
heavily on the table he was red in the
face and glaring but his secretary did not
even wince

  youre threatening me he almost
shouted

  mary shrugged

   its blackmail i tell you

   on the contrary it will all be strictly
according to law said mary with appalling
calmness

   pete put you up to this 

   i am not in the habit of discussing so-
cial affairs with your valet

   then its aunt caroline

 no your aunt left everything to me
bill began shaking a formidable finger
but the table was between them and mary
felt no immediate cause for apprehension

   ill never stand for it i wont have a
party i wont be here when it happens
youre swinging a club on me and last
night i thought you were a good sport

   i merely intend to earn my salary
said mary  i make no pretensions to
being a sport i could never hope to equal-
well we wont go into the sporting phase
of it if you please

  bill was momentarily brought to halt
then came another inspiration

   call this off and ill double your
salary he announced

  mary shook her head

   thats offering me a bribe she said
 beside i believe your aunt pays my
salary

   ill make up the difference out of my
allowance

   no thank you

  bill had never learned the science of deal-

ing with women there are about -

	grown men in the world all exactly
like bill so while he felt that h had been
singled out as the sole victim of a mach-
iavellian female in reality he had all man-
kind for a companion the sheer hope-
lessness of his plight made him calm again

   you admit that youre my secretary
dont you he asked

  mary nodded

   then im entitled to your advice isnt
that so

   yes answered mary cautiously  i
wouldnt volunteer advice but if you ask
it thats different

   all right i ask it advise me how i
can duck this party

  mary laughed outright

   i couldnt possibly i can only advise
you that there isnt any way in the world
to duck it and thats honest advice mr
marshall

  he resumed his chair and began drawing
diagrams on a sheet of paper this occu-
pation absorbed all his attention for sev-
eral minutes when he glanced up he was
grinning helplessly

   some day ill get even for this he
said  but right now ill admit youve got
me go ahead but dont rub it into me
any more than you have to

   why of course i wont declared
mary heartily  all along ive been try-
ing to save you from getting into society
another way

  bill nodded an acknowledgment of the
fact

   what date shall it be she asked

   the quicker the better i never got
warmed up standing on the edge of a swim-
ming tank wondering how cold the water
was

   well make it as early as possible then
do vou think it ought to be a larsje partv

   no

   neither do i agreed mary  but it
ought to be exclusive-very exclusive

   are you reminding me of something
 no laughed mary  i wasnt think-
ing of that now about the invitations
do you think they should be engraved or
would it be a little better to write personal
notes to everybody


all-story weekly

  thats your end of the job how do
 i know

 i think perhaps id better consult one
 or two of the fashionable stationers said
 mary  i want to find out just what
 theyre doing this season

 bill looked at his watch

  all right lets go anti see the stationers
 now

  its almost lunch-time isnt it
 almost thats why i want to go and
 see the stationers

  oh said mary

  come along you owe me something
 after what youve done

 she smiled at that although she was not
 quite certain whether she ought to go still
 he had really surrendered and she felt
 rather grateful to him

  all right ill get my hat she said
 five minutes later they were moving up
 fifth avenue in bills car

  would you honestly have turned me
 over to the bondsman he asked suddenly

 u lets talk about stationery she re-
 minded him  i suppose for a man it
 ought to be plain white

   bill turned to study her and bumped
 fenders with a taxicab

  pink he declared

  pink for a man

  pink with little freckles on it he said
 taking another look

   mary lifted her chin and watched the
 traffic presently he turned into a side
 street and ran on for half a block

  anyhow heres where we take lunch
 he announced

chapter x

the leopards spots

 pete hatched the largest chair forward
 lifted a foot to the top of bills writ-
 ing-table crossed the other upon it
 and glared sourly at the wall in front of him
  youll get to like it yet he predicted
  bull observed bill  im a leopard
 i cant change em

  you can have em changed for you all
 right many a good leopard has been
 skinned bill

   what are you beefing about youre
responsible for getting me in on this more
than anybody else

  u oh go ahead lay off on me its a
grand joke because you see im down
where do i come in

   where does anybodys valet come in
countered bill as he stropped a razor

   you said it thats just the point
youre copping all the cream im a ser-
vant thats all it isnt neighborly bill
gosh hang it it isnt democracy do you
call it a square deal sneaking her off to a
lunch

   that was business pete we had to
look at stationery beside dont i give
you my evenings

   is it right that i eat in the servants
dining-room is it right that i sleep in the
servants quarters me-your guest is
that a way to treat a guy who passed your
college exams for you and she thinks im
a servant too ill leave it to you if its
right

   but aunt caroline puts you in a class
by yourself observed bill u aunt caro-
line doesnt misjudge you pete even if you
do claim to be a valet

  pete allocated aunt caroline according
to his idea of where she would do the most
good

  but she treats me as if i was somebody
to take orders from her he grumbled on
 shes losing her respect for me
u oh forget miss norcross

   what forget gray eyes forget
little nell why dont you try it yourself
bill

   i dont have to shes my secretary
said bill maliciously

 shes your dancing-teacher you mean
ive seen you at it the two of you getting
ready for the party bill marshall youre
losing your character and your self-respect
bill grinned complacently

   it isnt as if you needed to learn to
dance added pete as he kicked a book
off the table  you can dance rings around
her if you want to but youre deceitful
bill shes got you one-twoing and three-
fouring all over the library and you making
believe its all new stuff its a gol darned
shame and im going to tell her so
good references



   youre going to mind your own busi-
ness or get busted predicted bill  it
doesnt make any difference what i used to
know about dancing i need practise be-
sides you can always go and talk theology
to aunt caroline shes never busy

  pete groaned

   im laying off it-when shell let me
he said miserably  shes getting inter-
ested in it bill yesterday i had to go and
bone up some more in the encyclopedia i
was all run out of stuff

  all right son only dont accuse me
pete subsided into silence and bill
shaved the young man who would be a
valet was not enjoying a happy morning
part of it was because of the night before
but some of the unhappiness lay rooted in
the fact that bills secretary persisted in
taking him at face value at the same time
pete was convinced that she knew better
that there was a mocking deliberation in
the way that she held him to his bargain
 confound it bill that girls no fool
 i said it first bill reminded him  i
said it days ago

   she knows darn well im something
more than a valet

   she never said it to me pete never
even hinted at it i dont believe she even
suspects

   bill thats an insult if you say she
doesnt even suspect ill poison you why
any girl with good sense would suspect
do i look like a valet

   sure

  bill had finished shaving so it was easy
enough to dodge the book

  there had been a good deal of talk like
that ever since the party became a fixed
project pete stearns was discovering that
the business of flinging gibes had become
less profitable either bills hide was getting
thicker or his perceptions were becoming
dulled it was no longer possible always
to get a rise sometimes it shocked him to
find that he was rising himself and then
there was that secretary she had annoying
moments of superiority she was in a fair
way to become a snob thought pete and
just because she could not recognize the
difference between a real social gulf and one
that was self-imposed some day he was

going to cross that gulf in a wild leap and
make her feel silly

   where you going now he demanded
as bill made for the door

   business old dear cheer up

  bills business was in the office on the
second floor it or she-or both-had
been making a good many demands on his
time he bore them with a fortitude that
made him proud of himself

   good morning said mary looking up
 any more names to suggest

   havent we dug up enough

   we should have a margin to allow for
declinations there are bound to be a few
you know even some of the people who
accept dont come

   i dont think of anybody else said
bill  youve got a whole lot of people
now that i never saw or heard of

   im quite proud of the list she said
 some of it is really distinguished and-
oh by the way mr marshall your aunt
gave me another name you must know
him of course bishop wrangell

   what that old dodo

 hes a bishop a very old friend of
your aunts and bishops are very exclu-
sive i think its fine to have a bishop 
 hes a dodo reaffirmed bill  hell
crab it all cut him off

   but ive already invited him said
mary  its in the mail

   hell talk everybody to death groaned
bill  i know him hes been here to
dinner its a curse to have a party but
bishops are damnation

   you surprise me observed mary he
did not

   but you dont know this bird and t do
hes so dry that the dust flies out of him
when he talks

   well im sorry but its done i
couldnt very well refuse your aunt

   oh i suppose so just because hes a
bishop aunt caroline thinks hes going to
put her on the free-list when she hits
heaven a bishop what are we going to
have at this party prayers

  mary bent over her work until she was
sure that she had command of herself

   say  exclaimed bill  i kmnv a stunt
would it be all right to invite my valet


all-story weekly

 no t should think not answered
mary  you mean as a guest why in
the world do you want him

  he could entertain the bishop we
 could make that his special job come on
 lets do it

 mary smiled but shook her head deci-
 sively

  your guests would never forgive you if
 they discovered that you had invited your
 valet you see such things are not done
 she had slipped into the employment of
 that little phrase until it came to her lips
 as a reason for almost any prohibition that
 dealt with the social code

  but i want to do it as a special favor
 to pete urged bill

  or as a special penance perhaps said
 mary with a wise look  no and besides
 your valet will doubtless have his duties
 that evening hell be needed in the gen-
 tlemens dressing-room

 bill picked up a morning paper and
 turned to the sporting page suddenly he
 looked up

  say if you can squeeze a bishop in at
 this stage of the game i ought to be entitled
 to invite somebody else hadnt i

  of course i asked for suggestions

  well i want to invite a very very good
 friend of mine

 v  who asked mary cautiously

 -j  hes an italian

 she raised her eyebrows and wrinkled
 her forehead into an inquiry

  an artist added bill

 s	oh now that sounds promising

   a wop artist his name is valentino
  why of course weve got room for
 him she said  i think its a splendid
 idea mr marshall i hadnt any notion
 that you had friends in the art world im
 very much interested in art myself what
 does he paint

  hes a sculptor said bill

  better yet thats even more distin-
 guished he must have the true tempera-
 ment

  oh barrels of it

  an impressionist or a realist

 bill considered

 u id say he was a little of both hes
 very strong on impressions but he produces

them in a realistic way if you can get what

i mean

  his work has strength commented
mary with a nod of understanding

   youve got it thats exactly it miss
norcross hes young but hes already
made a name for himself he makes a spe-
cialty of working on heads and busts

   his full name inquired mary

   antonio valentino

  oh i like it she exclaimed  hes
the onty artist well have perhaps another
time we can get him to bring his friends
what is the address please

   he has a studio over on the east side
wait a second

  bill searched a pocket and discovered a
memorandum of the address

   and when you write he advised
 dont address it to  mister make it
 signor hes accustomed to that and it ii
please him

   signor antonio valentino said mary
reading from her list  quite the most dis-
tinguished name at the party mr marshall
thats the best suggestion youve made
yet

  bill smiled as though he had done a full
mornings work

   and now if youve nothing more for
the present i have errands to do she an-
nounced  will you excuse me

   dont i get another dancing lesson i
thought you said-

  mary shook her head as she gathered up
some papers

   ive been thinking about your danc-
ing she said  and ive come to the con-
clusion mr marshall that there isnt any-
thing more i can teach you youve done
so well that sometimes i suspect-

  that seemed a good place to end the
sentence and she walked out of the room
leaving bill to wonder whether pete had not
already played him false

  on her way out mary remembered that
she wanted to speak to aunt caroline about
the florist but at the threshold of the libra-
ry she paused aunt caroline was engaged

    wish youd continue where you left
off yesterday she was saying

   about what madam it was the
voice of the valet
good references



   why it was about theology

   ah yes but you see there are so
many kinds do you remember just which
we were discussing speculative philoso-
phical practical or dogmatic 

   mercy peter how should i know
but it was interesting so please go on

   very good madam i think we might
go into the catechetical school for a bit and
that will lead us up to the doctrine of penal
substitution

  splendid said aunt caroline

  mary tiptoed down the hall holding a
gloved hand tightly over her lips when
she reached the street she let the laugh have
its way

   now what do you know about that
she murmured and mary was not an
adept in the use of slang

  some hours later she was discussing final
preparations with nell norcross who had
convalesced to the point where she was sit-
ting up in a chair and taking a vivid inter-
est in everything that concerned the social
fortunes of bill marshall debutant

   and now i have a surprise for you
said mary  youre coming to the party
yourself

   i exclaimed nell

   youre quite well enough and ill need
your help rav dear im counting on you
 but mary-oh i cant

   nonsense ive spoken to miss mar-
shall about it i explained i had a friend
who had also done secretarial work and
who really knew a great deal more about
it than i do and she said by all means to
bring you there wont really be anything
for you to do but you  just be there in
case we need some expert advice

   i dont believe im strong enough de-
murred nell

   yes you are i asked the doctor he
said it would do you good

   but i havent a dress mary

   yes you have ive ordered one-one
for you and one for me theyre with the
compliments of miss marshall theyre per-
fect dreams and were the luckiest people
alive

   youre a conspirator complained nell
 honestly mary i dont think i ought to
go im sure i shouldnt

   	a-s 

  one of those determined looks flashed
into marys face

   nell norcross youve got to go i
wont let you stay away its time you did
something here ive been skating along
on thin ice bluffing and pretending and tell-
ing fibs until i hardly know which is my
real name - yours or mine now ive
reached the very climax and youve got to
see me through im going to be adamant
nell sighed

   youre a whole lot bossier than you
were the day i met you in the brain work-
ers exchange she said petulantly

   dont ever mention that place and
mary made a grimace  it gives me
crawly little chills	

   will i have to bring any more refer-
ences

   no you silly thing references in-
deed why nell you wont go to this
party on references youll go on my repu-
tation  

   mary wayne im in awe of you
  mary laughed

   you wouldnt be if you knew how much

i	feellike a charlatan its all on the out-
side nell i am just hollow emptiness
the shell is the only thing that holds me
together

nell made a gesture of reluctant assent
 ill go if youll let me meet the italian
sculptor she said  i adore sculptors
 you can meet the sculptor and the
bishop both promised mary  and if
youre very good ill let you meet the valet
 but not of course mr marshall

   pooh thats nothing exciting any-
body can meet him my dear

   mary said nell  inside of the mar-
shall house you may be a marvelous liar
but outside of it your work is really very-
poor

chapter xi

the valet in the house

a small thin girl with large vivid
eyes a blue dress and collar-bones
who was zooming up-stairs two
steps at a time ran head on into bill who
was coming slowly down her head struck


all-story weekly

him at the waist line and bill sat down on a
step she immediately sat beside him

   isnt this the funniest party she ex-
claimed  did i hurt you

   it is and you didnt answered bill
  he had never seen her before

   i havent seen a soul i know except
mother who brought me here

   neither have i said bill glancing
down-stairs at the crush

   heaven knows why they invited us
mother says that father used to know some-
body in the family years and years ago
she says theyre really all right too we
just came because things have been so terri-
bly dull in town that weve been sitting
home screaming do you ever feel like
screaming

   right now

   go ahead she advised  im sure it
will be all right anyhow we came they
have perfectly lovely things to eat and
the house is so beautiful but its funny
just the same did you know there was a
a bishop here

   i heard so

   there is he shook hands with me he
was so solemn it seemed like shaking hands
with god and there are piles of middle-
aged people here arent there i dont
mean there arent any young ones for of
course there are-just millions but there
are more middle-aged ones still the music
is just wonderful who is the queer old
lady who wears the little cap

   i believe she lives here said bill

   well shes perfectly dear she patted
me on the head and asked me if i was
henry kingsleys little girl i told her i
was i didnt want to disappoint her but
im not im arnold gibbss little girl
and-somebody elses

  she chirped her way through the conver-
sation like a voluble bird

   engaged she added holding up a
finger  but hes not here so its all right
for me to sit on the stairs with you heres
something else thats funny i havent met
the man theyre giving the party for isnt
that a scream somehow wre got in late
or something or other hes awfully high-
brow oh yes i heard that the first thing
youre not highbrow are you

  bill shook his head

   its comfortable to know youre not
she said  whenever i meet an intellect i
make a holy show of myself did you know
that hes sailing for australia to-morrow
uhuh hes going there to study some-
thing or other they told me that down-
stairs too lets see what is it hes going
to study crustaceans thats it what
are they negroes

   im not up on them said bill
 maybe

   anyhow hes going to study them
and then hes going to write volumes and
volumes about them hes a scientist isnt
it funny to be at a scientific party and-
oh yes it seems theres been an affair in
his life hes going away to bury his heart
while hes studying the thingamajigs did
you ever hear of anything so romantic
bill turned his head for a better survey
of the young person with the astonishing
information

   where did you pick up all the info
he inquired as carelessly as he could

   from a young man who knows ail
about him answered arnold gibbss little
girl

   what sort of a young man

   oh a nice one hes kind of thin and
pale and he has baby-stare eyes

   does he have funny wrinkles at the
corners of them when he laughs asked
bill

  thats exactly what he has she ex-
claimed  how beautifully you describe
are you a detective they have them at
parties you know

   no im not a detective i-er-just
happen to know him i think

  bill wiped his forehead with a handker-
chief and stared straight ahead

   where did you meet him he asked
after a pause

   oh down-stairs you can meet any-
body at a party you know its perfectly
all right if people werent perfectly all
right they wouldnt be invited he dances
beautifully

   you mean to say-

   twice we danced out in the conser-
vatory it seems hes bashful he wouldnt
go into the big rodm for fear hed bump me

into people or step on their feet he isnt
sure of himself but i dont see why be-
cause he dances excruciatingly well but
he wouldnt believe  was engaged so i had
to run away from him

   dont quite get that

   kissed me she sighed  oh well a
partys a party but i wouldnt let him do
it again

  w would you like to have me lick him
asked bill his voice slightly trembling

   lick him what in the world for
because he didnt know why what a
queer person you are

  bill felt that he was indeed a very queer
person he was the owner of a party at
which his valet had danced twice with one
of his guests and kissed her as an additional
token of democracy he did not know
whether to rage or laugh but-oh if aunt
caroline ever heard of it or his secretary

  	perhaps youd like to dance with me
she added

  bill was startled but he mumbled an
affirmative

    lets go then and she trotted down-
stairs ahead of him as eager as a kitten
chasing a paper ball

  in the lower hall bill felt a touch on his
arm and turned to face mary wayne

   may i interrupt just a moment she
asked then to the girl  i know youll
excuse me i wont keep mr marshall a
minute

  the small one in the blue dress gave a
frightened stare at bill shrieked and fled
into the crowd

   have i offended her asked mary
anxiously  im sorry i dont seem to
place her although ive been trying to re-
member all the guests

   thats arnold gibbss little girl ex-
plained bill  shes been telling me things
about my party and now shes just dis-
covered who i am

  a oh and you let the poor child go on
and on of course how awfully mean of
you will you never learn mary frowned
at him with all the severity of a sister
 but thats not what i wanted to speak to
you about youve been hiding-and you
mustnt people are asking where you are
please-please dont spoil things its your

party and youve just got to be present
at it

  bill made a face

   im tired of being exhibited he
growled im tired of meeting people who
say  so this is little willie marshall
mercy how youve grown i havent seen
you since you wore knickerbockers but
youre a marshall sure enough youre the
image of your father i tell you fm sick
of it

   but its only for once pleaded mary
 now theyve met you they wont do it
again but what i want you to do now is
to go in and dance with some of the joung
people there are some lovely girls in
there and theyre just sitting around
come ill introduce you if you havent al-
ready met them

  but bill hung back he did not want
to dance at all he was grateful because his
secretary had inadvertently saved him from
arnold gibbss little girl there was wo
in his eyes as he looked at mary there
was every sound reason why his expression
should have been different for mary in her
party gown from aunt caroline inspired
anything but wo even she herself was
conscious of the fact that die looked nice
bill was becoming slowly conscious of it
himself although he could not drive the
gloom out of his soul

   come she said peremptorily hooking
her arm in his

   ill dance with you he offered
u that wont do at all im not a guest
u if i cant dance with you i wwit danoe
with anybody

  she shook her head impatiently

   please be sensible mr marshall

   you first declared bill stubbornly

   no its not the thing for you to do
at all perhaps later but-

  well go out in the conservatory and
dance

   but nobody is dancing out there

   come on then

  bill started with her arm prisoned in a
grip that forbid escape

   well if i dance with you said mary-
as she was dragged along  then afterward
you must promise to-

   maybe


all-story weekly

  they stood at the entrance to the con-
servatory mary still scolding in an under-
tone suddenly she pinched his arm vio-
lently and pointed an animated couple
were swinging into view from behind a
thatch of palms his valet-and arnold
gibbss little girl

  oh heavens said mary

   she fled with bill trailing in her wake

  even at that it was not a bad party it
was somewhat overwhelmed with descend-
ants it is true descendants of relatives and
of old friends and of persons who were inti-
mates of bill marshalls grandfather but
some of the descendants were young and
were managing to have a good time aunt
caroline had her own circle a sort of little
backwater into which descendants eddied
and tarried a bit and from which they
eddied out again in fact aunt caroline
had a party within a party her perma-
nent guest seemed to be the bishop once
caught in the backwater he never escaped
into the stream he stayed there with aunt
caroline while the descendants whirled
gently around them but the bishop was
amiable in his dusty way while his dignity
was unimpeachable he had made an im-
pression on arnold gibbss little girl and
what more could any bishop do

  nell norcross known to the household
and its guests as  miss wayne did not
prove to be such a reliance as mary hoped
perhaps it was because she was a convales-
cent and did not feel equal to the ordeal of
plunging boldly into affairs perhaps it was
due to a natural diffidence among strangers
but whatever it was mary discovered that
she was almost wholly upon her own re-
sources that nell was not rising capably
to the emergency that she edged off into
the middle distance or the background with
irritating persistence that in short nell
with all her wealth of experience and all her
highly attested worth as an expert was un-
able to adapt herself to the situation so well
as the amateur secretary nell even ad-
mitted this shortcoming to mary

   i feel strange because im being called
by your name she offered as an expla-
nation

  mercy said mary how about
me

   but youve become accustomed to it
my dear never mind im sure ill bright-
en up as soon as the sculptor comes

   there id forgotten him oh i hope
he doesnt fail i must find mr marshall
and ask him if hes heard anything have
you seen him ill hunt around for him i
suppose hes trying to hibernate again

  and once more mary started on the trail
of bill marshall for the double purpose of
dragging him back into society and inquir-
ing as to the whereabouts of the sigwr
from italy

  pete stearns was in purgatory he had
been sent for by aunt caroline discovered
by a servant and haled to the backwater
into which he was irresistibly sucked

   bishop said aunt caroline  this is
the young man of whom i spoke

  the bishop took petes hand pressed it
gently and retained it

   my young friend he said  you are
on the threshold of a career that offers you
priceless opportunities have you looked
well into your heart do you find yourself
ready to dedicate your whole life to the
work

   sir replied pete with a shake in his
voice  it is my ambition to become nothing
less than a bishop

   there i told you so said aunt caro-
line

   have you a sound theological founda-
tion asked the bishop still holding petes
hand

    i should say he had exclaimed aunt
caroline  what was it you were telling
me about yesterday peter the cat-
cat-

   the catechetical lectures of cyril of
jerusalem said pete smoothly  from
that we go on to the doctrines of arius of
antioch

   that would be going backward com-
mented the bishop

   hull oh certainly sir strictly speak-
ing but we have been skipping around a
bit if i may say it sir hitting the high-
that is sir taking up such matters as in-
terest us theistic philosophy ethical ra-
tionalism harnacks conception of mono-
physticism gregory of nyssa anselm of
canterbury-
good references



   who wrote the  canterbury ales 
interrupted aunt caroline  wasnt that
what you told me peter

  but peter was hurrying on

   miss marshall has been good enough
sir to show some small interest in my work
it has been a great encouragement to me i
may say that in the field of philosophical
anti speculative theology-

   stick to the dogmatic my friend ad-
vised the bishop- the dogmatic and the
special dogmatic be sound whatever you
are now here is a test  apply to every
young man it shows the trend of his
thought it tells me whether he has em-
barked upon the proper course give me my
young friend an outline of your views on
diophysite orthodoxy

  pete coughed and lifted his glance to the
ceiling

   confound the old coot he was telling
himself  he has me out on a limb what
will i do how in-

  and then-rescue a small person in a
blue dress floated into the backwater

   oh heres my nice man she said as
she possessed herself of petes arm  bish-
op let go of his hand hes going to teach
me that newr vamp thing hurry teacher
the music started ages ago

  and as pete was towed out of the back-
water by arnold gibbss little girl the bish-
op and aunt caroline stared after him

   i greatly fear observed the bishop
 that our young friend is somewhat in the
grip of predestinarianism

   bishop you frighten me said aunt
caroline  but ill take it up with him
in the morning

  when another partner had invaded the
conservatory and claimed the little girl in
the blue dress pete stearns sighed

   there goes the only one who doesnt
suspect me he said  the only real little
democrat in the place although its only
ignorance in her case of course oh well
its not so bad im doing better than bill
at that

  somebody tapped him on the arm

   ive been waiting for an opportunity
said nell norcross   do not wish to

make a scene but i understand that you
are mr marshalls valet is that correct
pete looked her in the eye and speculated
 i think i am not mistaken said nell
after she had waited sufficiently for an an-
swer  may i ask then if it is customary
for valets to dance with the guests of their
employers

    madam said pete  may  in turn ask
by what authority you question me

    there is nothing mysterious about my
position in this house replied nell  i
am here as an assistant to miss-norcross
it was annoying to stumble over the name
 miss marshall understands perfectly i
am here at her request i think you will do
a very wise thing if you retire to the gen-
tlemens dressing-room and remain there
am i clear

   it was petes first glimpse at close hand
of the social secretarys aide it did not
bore him in the least he might have de-
scribed her pallor as  interesting had he
been prone to commonplaces her eyes he
thought were even better than those of
arnold gibbss little girl they were not so
vivid perhaps yet more deeply luminous

    let us debate this matter he said
 will you sit down

    certainly not

    aw lets

  he spoke with a disarming persuasion
but nell refused to be seated

    will you go up-stairs at once she de-
manded

   pete placed a finger against his lips and
glanced from side to side  suppose he
said  i were to tell you a great secret
 go at once

    suppose we exchange secrets be whis-
pered

  that startled her what did he mean
did he know anything-or suspect

   suppose- he stopped turned his
head slightly and listened  something is
happening he said  lets run

  and before nell norcross knew it she
was running her hand in his for all the
world like alice in the looking glass coun-
trv dashing breathlessly along with the
red queen shouting faster faster

to be continued next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and
that you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month
in this historical story the author-who has made a careful study of the subject-gives a
plausible and romantic explanation of the fate of the colony sent in  by sir walter
raleigh to found an agricultural state in virginia virginia dare the heroine of mr millers
story and the first white child born of english parents in america came into the world in
august  her grandfather john white the governor of the colony sailed for england
a few days after her birth when he returned to virginia a year later the colonists had disap-
peared  the only trace of their destination being the word  croatan -a place supposed to
belong to a friendly tribe of indians-carved on the trunk of a tree there was no sign of a
massacre and it was supposed that the colonists had gone willingly historians have traced
the colony to the present site of the croatan reservation but the exact fate of the lost colony
remains a fascinating mystery of early american history this story makes no pretense of
being more than fiction yet good history and good historical fiction often are much the same
thing perhaps the solution of the mystery offered by mr miller is the correct one

irginia said john sampson
pleadingly

  virginia sat on the river bank
her bare feet dabbling in the water her
eyes lost in the reverie as she stared across
at the thick ranks of bottle-trunked ashes
gums and cypress that fringed the swampy
shores as far as the eye could reach

   virginia

  virginia awoke from her reflections with
a start and turned to face him inquiringly
john sampson seemed particularly insistent
this golden october evening of 

   what wilt thou john she asked and
there was a note of impatience in her voice
that might well have bid sampson beware

   virginia he trembled  once again-
wilt thou not harken to my suit-

  he got no further virginia turned
about with a shrug of disdain kicking
fiercely at a small frog who was resting with
paws on an outlying rootlet

   nay and i would not have a fliousand
such she sneered bitterly wert not
thou a boy at roanoke when we moved to
this land of savages and yet hast no long-
ing no urge to see aught of thine own peo-
ple again la we do sink to the level of
swine here while the great world doth go
about his mighty affairs-and we lie here
and-rot

   have we not twice essayed to have
speech with those at jamestown but thou
knowest that een though the tuscaroras
and the chowans are friendly powhatans
folk did turn us back-as he hath those
sent out by captain john smith to seek
us

   pish and had not one of ye all the
woodcraft to steal through taunted vir-
ginia  would that i were a man of

   yea and right glad was i to get back
under manteos protection  retorted samp-
son u better to live in peace here and
raise crops than to be slain of wounds dealt
us by hostile savages the croatans say
that the jamestowne folk fare wretchedly
always at war with the pamunkeys always
lacking com and meat

roanoke a baby my grandfather john
white is god knoweth where perhaps at
jamestown seeking for us my mother
hath long since passed away and ananias
dare doth age and grow feeble-while the
rest of ye are but little better than savages

  u fie he that doth ask my hand shall
first lead me out of this land and take ship
to england i will not marry with no rites
of church or priest-to raise potatoes and
squashes like a squaw 

  again she shrugged her shoulders and
stared fixedly into the swirling waters of
the noble river that is now called the lum-
bee sampson withdrew crestfallen

  aside from his buckskin clothes there
was little to distinguish him from the croa-
tan braves who were his fellows he
walked out of the little glade joining a
young buck who loitered in the background
the latter was smooth shaven except for a
crest of hair that parted his skull and was
naked but for an apron of coarse cotton
cloth he was a dandy highly-painted and
tattooed and his arm and calf muscles were
ornamented with beaded girdles from which
dangled long tassels of human hair

  both young men wore bows over their
shoulders and quivers of arrows at their
thighs and putting an arm over the in-
dians shoulder sampson left the glade
leaving virginia to her discontent

  her eye roved up-stream to the end of
the long reach where a huge cypress grew
out of the center of the stream its branches
towering a hundred and fifty feet above the
water its great swollen bowl fifteen feet in
diameter where the stream laved around its
mossy circumference a century later these

trees were to be called  dram  trees by
the north carolina settlers for in passing
them on their log rafts it was the custom
to take a dram of rum all around by way
of celebration

  this particular tree bore the great totem
of the croatans and was the landmark di-
viding their territory from the cherokees
to the west not in twenty years since
manteo the chief who was baptized on
roanoke came to be head sachem of the
croatans had it ever been passed by hos-
tile parties from either tribe so benign and
just had been his rule

  virginia watched it with longing heart
to her it was but another prison bar
another landmark of the girdle of savagery
that ringed about the lost colony of roa-
noke

   la but were the cherokees only
friendly to us whites she sighed one
might pass through their hill country and
so come around the pamunkeys of pow-
hatan to jamestown-and then a ship
home would that  were a man she
again exclaimed the longing to do and
dare surging up in her soul

  then she sprang to her feet in excite-
ment for from up-stream came the dull
muffled boom that could be heard from no
other piece than a matchlock she knew all
about matchlocks her father had one
brought away from roanoke and though
the remnants of the colony preferred bows
and arrows for hunting they still kept the
pieces and the precious powder for them

  as she watched a small dugout shot
around a big tree and her eyes caught the
flash of sunlight on armor a lone human
was paddling it for dear life looking back
over his shoulder as he fled then a long
war-canoe filled with cherokees shot past
the tree and its crew tossing up their
paddles with rage abandoned the chase and
put the canoe around

  virginia danced with excitement a
man a white man after twenty years
she clapped her hands with joy and
whooped shrilly her eyes feasting on him

  the paddler drew nearer his stroke
seemed to be toilsome desperate and she
could now note an arrow sticking from his
shoulder then he collapsed and fell for-

ward into the canoe and the dugout drifted
aimlessly down on the broad bosom of the
river

  on the rapid sweep of the tide it would
not be ten minutes before it would drift on
down-stream and be gone perhaps forever
there was no time to run back to the high
ground and get the braves from the villiage
so virginia hesitated not a minute but
plunged in her heavily-decorated buckskin
skirt surging its bright beads and porcupine
embroidery in waving lines as she struck
out to intercept the canoe

  she met it in mid-stream crooked a
brown tanned arm over its gunwale and
turned it slantwise to the stream where the
current would edge it across finally a
half mile below the landing she managed
to grasp the trunk of a water-ash growing
a little further out from his fellows and so
pulled the canoe in among the trees where
her feet could touch bottom

  then she got into the canoe and seized
the paddle the man lay face downward
in the bottom with a pool of bloody water
swashing around him the arrow stuck
out from his left shoulder just above the
arm-pit curve of his cuirasse and both it
and his steel hauberk were dented and
nicked with the white quartz scratches of
cherokee arrowheads a drawn rapier and
the matchlock rolled about unheeded in the
round bottom of the dugout all the evi-
dences of a stem fight marked the canoe
feathered as it was with arrow shafts and
the cuts of quartz tomahawks of the de-
feated indians

  virginia paddled swiftly back to the
landing her heart throbbing the tears
pringling in her eyes this man moved
her strongly and still more so the thought
that he might die with never a word to
them from the outside world

  she raised a shrill war-whoop as she
drove the dugout up the mud banks of the
low river bluff that formed the canoe haven
for her villiage braves and settlers came
running down in a mixed body eager ques-
tions on their lips

   faith virginia and what hast thou
there exclaimed henry berry his blue
eyes staring out of his bearded face
 god tis a  white man-see to the

armor and the matchlock and the sword
tis a gentleman i trow by the latter 
they lifted him out and laid him gently
on the bank the man coughed and
gasped and then his eyes opened they
were full of suffering but a look of pleas-
ure mixed with perplexity began to dawn
in them as they looked up at the faces
surrounding him

   nay-tis but a scratch-a touch he
gasped  have a care with mine armor
as they gently unbuckled the cuirasse
again he studied their faces

  ye be odd savages he murmured
feebly looking into the blue and brown
eyes around him  tell me-ye are-ye
must be-them of roanoke he ques-
tioned his voice thrilling with eagerness

  we be returned berry oh fair
sir-

  ah-h sighed the stranger happily
and his eyes closed again as he sank back

   god rest you merry gentleman said
berry solemnly  he will speak again in
time-have a care my masters

  an indian deftly removed the arrow and
a compress of cotton wool was put over the
wound then a stretcher was improvised
and they bore him up to the village

   to my house directed virginia jeal-
ously  he is mine i found him

   where better than to the house of
snanias dare quoth berry agreeing with
her an old man came to the door of one
of the few log huts in the villiage as the
bearers proceeded

   how now wench he demanded
oh fayther tis wonderful cried
virginia  we have a white man-

   a white man  croaked dare  where
whence came he let me have speech
with him-

   nay fayther he is sore wounded
and-sleepeth she added glancing at the
tranquil face of the stranger  he shall
bide with us if it please you sir

   aye marry nodded dare  bring him
within

  as virginia watched by the cot of the
sleeper it seemed to her that she had never
beheld so handsome a man the stamp of
virginia dare



aristocracy marked his features with regu-
larity of outline and breathed through the
sterner characteristics set on them by a
lifetime at the wars

  the broad high forehead the heavy
arched eyebrows the straight regular nose
surmounting a pair of straight bristling
mustaches the soft full beard and a wide
sweep of curly hair over his ears-all were
of the gentlemen of note of his period
the wide linen collar that should lie over
the collet of his cuirasse was wanting how-
ever and his clothes though cut after the
london fashion virginia noted with some
curiosity were of buckskin and indian
stitched

  the man half awoke at intervals during
virginias vigil to beg for water but by
midnight he sank into a profound slumber
and did not stir again virginia awoke at
dawn from a fitful sleep in her chair to
find the strangers brown eyes fastened
upon her instantly they danced with a
quizzical humorous light and his lips curled
in a gay smile

   prithee maiden-how came i here
he asked glancing curiously around the
room his eye fell on his sword and
matchlock standing in the corner  aye
twas a stern fight-cut-thrust-and fire
mine arquebus all the way down-

   tush thou must not talk and excite
thyself reproved virginia  lest a fever
come upon thee of thy wound

   nay tis naught laughed the stranger
lightly  twas lucky the savages did not
wound me in my sword arm this in the
left shoulder was but a scratch tell me
what befell after i did pass the great tree

  virginia gave an account of how she
swam out and rescued him  and now
tell me fair sir she concluded admiration
glowing openly in her eyes  art thou that
great captain john smith of jamestown
concerning whom we hear much

  nay-nay exclaimed the stranger
hastily  not that bag of bombast-in
good sooth i am william bruster gentle-
man of sir walter raleighs train i did
wager him five thousand pounds-and tis
posted in the star and garter coffee-house
in london town-that i would find his lost
colony for him for sir walter hath spent

much moneys and sent many knaves and
runagates to seek ye none of whom did
aught but get slain by the savages or come
back with some woful tale of hardship

   besides i seek a little lady who was
born on roanoke twenty years ago she
will be second cousin to me-and her name
is virginia dare

  virginias hand went to her bosom and
her blue eyes streamed out to him as her
breast heaved and she choked for breath
 i-am-that same maiden  she managed
to gasp out at length as her eyes went
downcast under his keen glance

  bruster burst out into hilarious laughter
nay then i have won both wagers
that with sir walter-and that with my-
self

   virginia-i was but a lad when you
were born-all but the romance of thee
the first white child born in the new
world tis said will shakespeare hath a
play in mind writ about thy story think
of the brave mystery ot-the child carried
off by the savages when a baby-la his
 twelfth night  is not a candle tot

   nay then blushed virginia  but
here cometh my fayther ananias fay-
ther this gentleman is none other than our
cousin will bruster she called out get-
ting respectfully to her feet

  ananias dare came tottering into the
room as she spoke  brustw bruster
he murmured searching back through his
memories oh aye thou art own
cousin to john white governor of roanoke
-i recall thee lad as a stripling in eng-
land why have they sent no ship for us
lad

  but they did said bruster energeti-
cally from his cot  we have had stirring
times in england the spanish did send
a great armada against us and we all took
ship and did beat them right manfully
but for three years after you were left on
roanoke the seas were not passable ex-
cept for armed ships

   then came john white seeking ye but
the fort was deserted the grass growing in
the doorsteps of the houses and but the
one word  croatan  carved on an oaken
tree to tell him whither ye had gone there
was no cross on it and john whites armor

still hung in his house untouched so he
opined that ye had gone of your free will
and had settled on the mainland-but no
trace of ye could he find how came ye
to this far land

   manteo brought us said ananias
simply

   aye i have seen him said will
 he was the friendly chief that was bap-
tized on roanoke a week before virginia
here he came to england with the first
party and was received by our gracious
queen is he still alive

   verily and head sachem now of all
the croatans replied dare of a day
he cometh to the fort bringing word
through his young men that opecanough
would fain attack us with many war canoes

   to flee by land would be for all to be
massacred for we had nine children and
seventeen women with us so he came for
us all with many great canoes from the
south and we went for three days sail
down the sound and then traveled overland
through the croatan country where we
were wdl received for his sake

   and here we have abode for nigh
twenty years although twice in the last
three years have we organized expeditions
to have speech with those whites that we
hear through the indians are now far to
the north of us we got as far as the
country of the chowan wha are friendly
to us but there opecanough or powhatan
we know not which fell upon us and only
six men besides myself-and virginia and
john sampson who were scarce grown-
escaped how managed you to reach usj
bruster sat up  lend me thine aid to
yonder chair virginia he asked u i do
feel that soon i can be up and about
twas on a wager with sir walter and also
for cousin john whites sake who pineth
for news of his daughter-

   she is dead broke in ananias a
virginia gave a little sob at the recollection
 she died ten years ago virginia is all i
and the governor have left

   oh the sad news- cried bruster
sympathetically  the poor lady-but
to go on with my tale-t came to james-
town as we call it with the earliest settlers
twice did captain john smith send out an

expedition to find ye but powhatans chiefs
led them astray even now there is talk of
another under one captain samuel argall
 but i would have none of it one
must learn the ways of the savages in this
country to travel and explore in safety
and so by stealth i succeeded in passing
through powhatans country and for sev-
eral months lived on the chowan with the
friendly chief eyanoco here learned i
the ways of- the savages and then set forth
to find ye

   eyanoco did say that ye were on the
fourth big river to the south of his country
so i came through the tusearoras by aid
of a bark scroll given me by eyanoco but
when i came into the cherokees who are
hostile it was needful to travel by night
and go with great cunning and stealth
but i eluded their war parties stole a punt
from a cherokee village and so came
hither pursued by war canoes from which
by the grace of god i was able to escape-
though several of the savages were slain by
my hand

   tis bad said dare shaking his head
 i fear that they will send war chiefs to
demand thee of the croatans we will go
to manteo and claim his protection as soon
as thou canst move

   faith and i am ready now said
bruster energetically  my wound is but
a trifle i tell thee

  not so broke in virginia earnestly
k thou wert in a swoon of it when i found
thee thou must not stir i will bring
food anon

   ah virginia  laughed bruster  wilt
captain me art a girl of spirit we shall
take her back to england eh cousin
dare-there be men amongst you that will
follow me back again i trow

  old dare shook his head dully  nayr
but we be few and are growing old i fear
that it may rrot be he demurred  man
we be scattered through the villiages a few
here a few there and all have married
amongst the savages

   this life is good and peaceful and
wholesome-i for one would care not to
return to the old country where one must
swink and starve year in and year out to
live nor to the settlements to the north
virginia dare



where men do quarrel amongst themselves
and broil with the heathen affronting the
savages daily and at war with them al-
ways

  virginia had come in during this speech
with a maple-knob bowl in her hands she
looked at him open-mouthed with aston-
ished indignation

   for shame fayther  she cried  hast
no wish to leave this savagery and see thine
own people again ah the brave sights of
london town of which ye told me on winter
nights this is but the mere existence of
the deer and the pig that we lead here
oh say thou wilt go fayther dear she
implored with tears coming

  girl get thee hence ordered dare
sternly  thou dost forget thy manners
out on thee

  the girl fled sobbing from the room

   nay cousin chid bruster gently
 thou were too hard on her surely some
of this folk will venture back with me and
she might be of the company

   how wilt go scarce hadst thou come
here alive to return up the river is not
possible against the swift current and the
arrows of the cherokees down-stream the
pamlicos are of a mind with the pamunkeys
that no white man may venture into their
country

   as for virginia-i am growing old and
cannot spare her she shall marry that
good youth john sampson in due time

  indeed this feeling of contentment
seemed to prevail among the remnants of
the settlers in the villiage as bruster saw
more of them during the day those that
had indian wives and had fathered the
green-eyed and even gray-eyed children
playing happily about flatly refused to con-
sider leaving the tribe

  they plied bruster with questions about
the doings in the great w-orld but to leave
their peaceful fields of corn and cotton and
their abundant fish and game to be had
for the taking was a thing that they had
no desire for

  on the following day will and virginia
with dare and berry and a party of croa-
tans set forth for manteos villiage as
they approached it over a fairly good road
no doubt the first in america bruster

noted more log huts interspersed with the
brush and cane wigwams of the croatans
so unlike the stout palisades of the warlike
cherokees

  a glint of armor shone in the knot of
people coming out to meet them and brus-
ter in addition to the stately old chief
manteo met a few more of the old settlers
bedecked in ancient london finery the men
wearing the cuirasse and hauberk of en-
gland in honor of the occasion

  it seemed hard to realize that chief
manteo a kindly visaged grizzled old sav-
age in his tattoo and eagles feathers with
cotton shawl over shoulder had visited in
england was the trusted friend of sir wal-
ter raleigh and had even been presented
to queen elizabeth

   my young brother is very very wel-
come  beamed manteo  we have heard
of his bold exploits and that he bringeth us
word from sir walter he smiled

   indeed tis so returned will heartily
 his lordship hath in no wise forgotten ye
and hath spent much moneys to come at
some tidings of you but times have been
stern in old england and every ship hath
been needed to repel the spanish invader
 we too have done right diligently
many timeshave i sent runners and twice
have my white brethren essayed expeditions
to have speech with the whites of the north
but we are surrounded by tribes that are
not lovable to the white man even now
my young men tell me there cometh a
party under one captain samuel argali
from the north but it bideth with the man-
goags who will not let them pass

  answering volleys of questions bruster
turned and entered the villiage

  manteo touched him on the arm

   our only fort the house of the great
spirit he said pointing with great pride
to a log church that stood in the center of
the place  the red man knoweth but
dimly of him to the white was given the
full revelation he added devoutly  all
my people be christians it is good
bruster gazed curiously at the first
steeple in america a great standing
dead cypress had been hewn to a tall point
and against it was built a stout log church
the tree forming the front with a door cut

through its hollow base two other log
houses and a multitude of the characteristic
croatan pole and cane huts formed the
town while on every side stretched the
cultivated fields corn cotton beans squash
-even english wheat

  a new sensation in connection with this
folk gradually came over bruster and for
some time he could not just make it out
once alone and talking quietly with vir-
ginia the reason back of it dawned on him
here was peace the one spot on earth
where men did not quarrel where war was
unknown where striving and starvation
were things undreamed of

  for twenty years manteo had told him
there had been peace with the cherokees
to the north and the pamlicos to the east
even the whites had come under the spell
of it too few to make any organized trou-
ble with the croatans they had fallen in
readily with their peaceful ways the
fields and the forests gave bountifully of
wealth and the croatans who were known
to be warlike enough when once aroused
had been let alone to enjoy their industry
under christian manteo causes for quar-
rel with their neighbors had been justly set-
tled and the result had been an arcadian
bucolic existence only to be paralleled by
that of the hopis to-day

  it impressed bruster deeply man of
war as he had been from his youth it filled
him with admiration the serenity of it
however chafed on his adventurous war-
like spirit

   what and this folk do naught but
raise beans and hie them to church he
stamped  a pox on it what sayest
thou virginia-wilt no man return with
me to the settlements i had as well not
ventured my body on this enterprise as
bide here

   nay there is one that will second
thee she laughed softly a brave
youth-like unto thee he is living two
villiages from here truly shall i ask him
if he shall go with thee would that i
might go with thee too she burst out
looking at him longingly

   wouldst thou-just virginia  ex-
claimed will his fine eyes glowing at her
roguishly  art a maid ol spirit dost

thou fear naught of the forest and the

savages

 man naught fear i of either she re-
turned throwing back her head scornfully

 this is but the life of my faythers sow

mine own people do call to me-would that
i were a man strong and bold as thou art

wilt take me

 maid-it may not be said bruster
kindly taking both her hands in his

 thou hast the gamesome spirit but tis
in the body of a mere girl we must fight
and een be taken and put to the torture
mayhap before ever we see jamestown
again

  the girl cried out in dismay  then
stay brave sir stay with us she begged
impulsively

 nay it may not be retorted will
shortly  my wager is but half won

fetch thou this youth that ye prate of
girl

  bruster found even the younger men
obdurate about accompanying him they
did not wish to break the peace with their
neighbors as they considered themselves 
croatans and their tribe would be responsi-
ble for whatever they did manteo also
begged him to remain and eager as he was
to aid him could offer no plan

   to the rising sun for two sleeps jour-
ney my son lies the country of the pam-
licos and they are of a mind with pow-
hatan that no white man may set foot on
their land to the setting sun are the
cherokees who are already out on the war-
path after thee and they also lie between
thee and the tuscaroras who are friendly
nevertheless my young men will guide thee
through the cherokee country if thou wilt
not bide with us manteo hath spoken

  and so it was settled but on the next
day came an event which changed every-
thing two stalwart cherokee braves ac-
companied by a party of croatans came
into the village in their hands one bore
a ceremonial tomahawk with a flint head
and bedecked with red feathers and the
other a great calumet a peace-pipe whose
stone bowl had come from the far west
from the quarry beside the father of
waters
virginia dare



  they demanded to see manteo and a
council accordingly was called will
watched curiously to see his own people
squatting in the circle with the red men
under the mulberry-trees passing the calu-
met from mouth to mouth

  then the visiting chief made a long ad-
dress in cherokee as he pointed frequent-
ly at bruster and his pantomime was ex-
pressive will already knew the object of
his visit before manteo began speaking

  manteo arose to reply and virginia sit-
ting beside bruster translated the chero-
kees message  thou hast killed two of
their braves he saith and it shall be war
between our folk and them unless manteo
giveth thee up ah-heaven forefend
she choked huskily the tears coming to her
eyes

  tush girl grinned bruster weep
not for me tis one thing for him to give
me up-and yet another for them to take
me 

  manteos speech was halting and con-
ciliatory in its tones the peace of twenty
years hung on his words he offered much
com and cotton and wampum in reparation
but the cherokee chief was obdurate

     a canoe for a canoe a life for a life
it is the law he sayeth translated vir-
ginia tremblingly  we must not only re-
store the stolen canoe but must give up
thee and one other to do with as they
wish

  brusters owfn heart was now stirred with
doubts as to his duty in the matter of a
genial careless adventuresome nature
while he loved danger and battle he had
no wish to involve others in his affairs it
eemed something sacrilegious to disturb
the sacred holy peace of this people the
croatans were implacable fighters when
once aroused and there was a large ad-
mixture of white blood in them so he
foresaw a long and bloody war with the
fierce and powerful cherokees if he did not
interfere and manteo he could see had
no intention of giving him up instantly his
decision was formed

   nay then he interrupted getting up
to address the cherokee  it ill becomes a
gentleman of sir walters own train to be
bartered amongst savages like a sheep of

mine own venture came i here alas that
i had to slay your warriors but ye came
against me armed asking a great price my
life for a mere canoe

   this people shall take no hurt because
of me cherokee-ye shall freely have me
-if ye can take me manteo -address-
ing the old chieftain- i do not claim the
hospitality and protection of thy tribe
when i leave cherokee i shall meet my
obligation to thy people-as warrior to
warrior there is yet war betwixt ye and
me art satisfied

  he sat down and berry translated for
him the cherokees smiled with grim
pleasure their glances flashing at him ad-
miringly then the elder arose to speak

    my brother has spoken like a great
chief and a brave man saith he trans-
lated virginia in a whisper  and een so
think i she added her eyes glowing at
him artlessly   the cherokees will await
his coming and will treat him as a great
chief should be -which meaneth they will
put thee to the torture if taken ah no
thou must not let them she cried

   fear not maiden-i mind them not a
fly chuckled bruster his brown beard
waggling merrily over the collet of his
cuirasse  with this good sword i shall
cut my way through them or elude them
and so win back to jamestown how much
longer may i bide here chief he asked as
the cherokees took their departure

   one sun is the indian law then they
may come and take thee sooner would i
plunge this nation in blood said manteo

  nay but ye shall not stir a finger
replied bruster earnestly  my deeds shall
not bring war upon ye nor break the peace
that lieth between ye and the cherokees
marry i shall set forth this very night

iii

  virginia did not witness brusters de-
parture setting forth in the late after-
noon with the avowed purpose of finding
the youth who would accompany him she
hid in the pines determined to await his
coming and then track him as closely as she
dared

like a knight in glittering armor he had

come into her life bringing the light and
promise of the great outside world in his
very presence-that life which had formed
many a winter tale of her parents and
that she so yearned to taste herself and
-she was gloriously completely intoxi-
catingly in love with him

   such a man like a star above all other
men she had ever known in his fearless
yet kindly soul he was the very essence and
epitome of the brave courtiers of the great
elizabeth whom she held in reverence
above all other women

  to guide him through- the cherokee
country to give him the best of her knowl-
edge of indian woodcraft and then to re-
turn home with him for england was al-
ways the home of her dreams-that was
the height of virginias ambition and
then if he should so much as look upon
her with the eyes of love-virginia trem-
bled with delight at the thought and the
hot blush mantkd to her cheek that would
 be too much happiness for any girl to hope

 twilight came and a sickle moon shed
a soft radiance as virginia kept her vigil
 then with a bound of her heart she saw
him coming through the pines matchlock
i over shoulder sword swinging at side and
a careless whistle on his lips

i here under the tall long-leaf pines it
i was almost dusk and she had no trouble
in avoiding detection she turned and fol-
lowed the way led north through the
long grove and then out over a bear-oak
barren

i it was quite dark when he plunged
down into the dense tangle of cane cypress
gums and holly thllfcformed the creek bot-
tom of the water-course that marked the
boundary of the cherokee country brus-
ter stopped and then vanished in the cane

   after a long wait out of its depths is-
sued the bark of the dog-fox it was im-
mediately answered by the bark of another
dog-fox across the bottom virginia shook
her head that was an answer to his sig-
nal and the cherokees lacked finesse she
decided or they would have answered
naturally with the bark of the vixen so as
to lure him on

   bruster evidently detected the trap also
fr presently he emerged from the cane and

circled to the east virginia following him
a mile farther on he went into the cane
again and after a while the ghostly hoot
of the barred owl sounded through the cy-
press virginia smiled at the apt imitation
the man was a thorough woodsman for the
bird itself could not have done better but
it was answered by the call of a male owl
across the creek

  again virginia shook her head evi-
dently every foot of the creek shore was
watched bruster came back and for a
long while stood under a big pine while
the moon slowly set

  this was evidently what he was waiting
for and virginia felt that it was time for
her too to act for she could now no
longer see him she circled to the east
and hid under a huge cypress down in the
swamp after a time the low quavering
call of the so wet owl came to her ears from
the uplands behind her

  virginia answered with the check of the
female long minutes of silence parsed
and then in the intense blackness of the
place the click of the small owls beak
sounded close at hand virginia answered
with the soft tick of thumb-nail against
finger-nail

  presently she saw his figure glooming
around the bole of the cypress almost in-
distinguishable in the velvety blackness
his sword was drawn as he advanced step
by step then she arose from her knees
and her hand closed softly around his
sword-wrist while another stole around his
neck	

  friend she breathed it is i-
virginia

  virginia his arm shot around her
body  maiden what dost thou here he
whispered shakily

  take me take me home my lord
she whispered ardently  i-i-am that
youth who would accompany thee she
ended confusedly

 now by the splendor of god
breathed will as his eyes glowed admiring-
ly at her  art a valiant maid canst
shoot he whispered handing her a bow
and quiver

   marry that can i  returned virginia
 since i was a chit of a child
virginia dare



 nay then we two be an army
laughed bruster softly  hast any plan
by which we may come through these
heathen tis the women i note that
have always the quicker wit

  virginia puckered her brow and remained
for some time in silent thought then

   come i know of a place where the
creek is not like to be guarded virginia
whispered stretching out her hand to
bruster

  she led the way through the cane and
across the dark uplands silent as a shad-
ow they came to a sand barren where
for miles the short bear oaks covered the
soil the going was easier here and one
could see the stars overhead

  mile after mile of it she traversed while
always the black wall of the creek bottom
bounded them to the north finally the
ground became more broken and the swales
cut with short steep ravines briers tow-
ered overhead making their progress slow
and irritating in the extreme but bending
and dodging with her supple young body
virginia led the way through them

  then she came to an abrupt halt a
wild tangled jungle of oaks and briers
leaned every which way and in the dim
light of dawn bruster perceived what ap-
peared to be a high shelve of rock barring
their path it led straight athwart the wall
of cypress that marked the creek

   man saith that once on a time the
earth did heave and rock so that no man
could stand said virginia in a low tone
 many years agone twas when the
tremor goeth away this cleft was left it
reacheth for many miles into the cherokee
country come

  she wormed her way silently along
through the tangle of vegetation under the
fissure it was a wild eery spot with great
log windfalls crossing it where tall trees
had toppled over from the brink of the
shelf here if anywhere they might slip
through unobserved

  as they approached the creek the roar
of waters came rumbling to their ears and
again and again they stopped to listen for
hostile sound or signal the noise of fall-
ing water grew louder and louder and at
length they came to a rocky gorge through

which the creek tumbled in whitecapped

rapids

   no man hath ever crossed here-tis
not like that it be watched said virginia
as brusters eyes sparkled with the hope of
escape

   ha go to one might een swing
over by yon vine that groweth aloft up into
the cypress quoth bruster exultingly as
he scanned the possibilities

  he hacked at the base of the vine with
his sword where the thick muscadine had
started on its long voyage to the tree-tops
it soon swung clear without more ado he
grasped it strongly and with a running
leap swung across the rapids and landed
on a rock ledge on the far side

   now girl have a courage and do as
thou hast seen me he called to virginia
swinging the vine back to her

  like a floating butterfly she made the
run and swung lightly over bruster caught
her in his arms-and he did not let her
go for she was very warm and living
and good to hold and her fair young body
a sweet armful as she clung to him his
eyes looked deep into hers as he held her
close in his arms

   virginia-dost love me whispered
will the glowing fire of love burning in his
own  i swear thou art the very maid of
my soul

   thou knowest all my lord-i do but
know i love thee said the girl humbly
 whither thou goest go i-

  then a look of horror froze the words
on her lips her eyes dilated with terror
as they looked over brusters shoulder and
a sob gasped up from her bosom bruster
turned-to face the stern visage of a chero-
kee chieftain standing quietly beside them
he grinned broadly as bruster whipped out
his sword but made no hostile move with
his spear

  out stand thy distance fellow
gritted bruster throwing a protecting arm
around virginia and shielding her with the
rapier blade

  the savage smiled and waved his free
arm nonchalantly there were rustlings in
the underbrush and wild painted and
feathered faces glared out at them from the
rocks

  tis a bushment exclaimed bruster
bitterly  virginia we are undone this
blade shall slay thee and then all of them
it can bite let us enter heavens portals
together sweet betrothed

  but virginia began to speak to the
cherokee bruster judged from the en-
treaty in her tones that she was begging
for their lives he interrupted her harshly

   pish girl have an end i count
them not a fly-nor twenty such have
at thee wretch

  virginia restrained him as the cherokee
chief began to speak his voice was mea-
sured and authoritative and he dropped
his arm in conclusion with an air of finality
at his words virginia sprang to the fore
baring her breast to them passionately and
repeating over and over two words in
cherokee the chief heard her in calm
dignity but made no reply

   what is it that you say virginia
asked bruster breaking in anxiously

   they would barter my life for thine
declared the girl scornfully  and i have
bid them take mine and welcome me
they can slay now with their arrows and
will do so if thou dost not yield thee but
saith the chief thou art a great warrior
therefore me they offer to spare and i may
return to the croatans if thou wilt enter
their tribe-and-and-take the squaw of
war eagle-whom thou hast slain-to-to
wife sobbed virginia hot jealous tears
coming as she hid her eyes in her arm

  never declared bruster resolutely
 een die by my hand virginia i and my
good sword will face our fate

    v	v

  the cherokee sensed the drift of his
words for he uttered a short harsh com-
mand and instantly a dozen arrows were
drawn to the head aimed at virginias un-
protected bosom

  nay-hold shouted bruster hastily
 t cannot dot girl-i love thee  can-
not see thee slain tis a brave and war-
like people-tell the chief we will go with
them and  will care for the bereft squaw
-but tis for thy life virginia tell him
we are mall and wife together we live-
or together we die-let him choose

  she translated and the chiefs face soft-
ened he raised his left hand

   peace there is peace between me and
thee white man he exclaimed

   doth he accept then my hand and
honor ont exclaimed bruster joyfully
catching the drift of his words  truly
tis a warlike nation-one after my own
heart come virginia-thou wert worth
it

  the rest is history forty years later
in  the first settlers in north caro-
lina found the croatans speaking old
elizabethan english and tilling the soil
beside the lumbee river and among
the cherokees ruled a famous chief tah
chee the thunderer who was green-eyed
and of white descent perhaps the son
of william bruster and virginia dare for
he possessed the only matchlock in the
cherokee nation and with him the earli-
est parties of explorers from the virginia
colonies made the first treaty with the
cherokees

huang

it had been no easy task to win the con-
fidence of hosing huang but to-night
it seemed to tanner as though he had
accomplished his purpose leaning back
against the dingy wall of the smoke-veiled
room in manila he waited

  huang would appear suddenly gliding
swiftly out of the shadows with noiseless
movement tanner smiled at his own men-
tal image

  when the chief had sent him to manila
he had been delighted the prospect of
cornering the smugglers operating among
the islands had awakened vague exciting
possibilities all the old monotony of the
service had vanished in a dim haze of dream
it was a game worth playing the chinese
were wise with a stealthy guile that de-
manded all his subtlety and knowledge of
intrigue

  he watched the half-dozen natives at the
dirty tables speculatively overhead the
smoky oil lamps swayed mystically then
huang appeared he came as tanner ex-
pected gliding into his vision as though by
magic his black almond eyes darting
around the room

  u there is no silence so still as huangs
silence tanner said slowly and his deep
gray eyes became suggestive of things hot
to be spoken

  huang scrutinized his shabby dress with
an air of abstraction  are you waiting
his melodious voice crooned

   even time waits on the secret one re-

	a-s

sponded tanner who was wise in the ways
of the east

  huang drew out the chair opposite and
leaned across the table  from singapore
you make your way here-is the tale true

   true as the sun  laugh at the stu-
pidity of man

   why do you wish to go on the black
dragon

   i have said  must be in java tan-
ner leaned close as he answered  ameri-
cans are too many here and the boat i take
must take that which i carry tanner
watched the chinese eyes glisten at the last
phrase

   there are those among the chinese of
manila who deal in curios huangs tone
suggested a lurking doubt of the necessity
for flight

   there are curios no chinaman here
could sell it is not likely that the theft of
singapore can become the merchandise of
manila is not all law searching for the
jewels

  for a long time huang did not answer
at last he rose his woolen shirt glintingly
warmly green in the yellow light  the
gold-you have it with you my captain
would be most indignant

  tanner placed a leather pouch on the
table its open mouth became the dark
circumference of a yellow glitter as
huang took the bag his face betrayed noth-
ing but his fingers clutched eagerly he
spoke caressingly

   the black dragon sails at midnight
we must hurry

  tanner followed the silent figure into the




all-story weekly

night they had gone deep into a lightless
silence beneath a far pier before he was
allowed to walk beside his guide

   it must be repeated the chinaman
said  that you best stay concealed it is
not well to provoke the captain

   i will be as nothing i am nothing

  they paused and a rowboat was dragged
from a black hole where it had lain among
the filth tanner was accustomed to
strange things but the sudden sense of
strangeness so intricately tangled with a
vague feeling of repeating a former experi-
ence was disconcerting

  feeling for his weapons he stepped into
the boat huang took the oars and they
rocked perilously out into the black

  unable to decide how much of his story
the chinaman believed tanner kept his
hand on his gun he had given himself out
as having stolen the jewels which had van-
ished from the house of the governor of
singapore he was not known at manila
that was in his favor as were the chinese
papers he had brought to huang from hong-
kong

  he weighed his chances of discovery and
smiled  at least this promises interest
he told himself

  the boat came up abruptly beside a dark
hulk which made a denser shadow in the
starless night huang guided his hand to a
rope ladder and without a word tanner
climbed when he reached the deck he
waited his guide followed and still in
silence led him down into the hold of the
vessel

   you will remain here i bring food
huang was gone without waiting for an
answer

  after an interminable wait in the inky
blackness tanner felt the vessel moving
still utterly without assurance as to his
position he fell asleep but it was no peace-
ful slumber

  strange dreams unlike any he had ever
known paraded grotesque images before his
mind there were quaint chinese in un-
familiar dress gathered about him inter-
woven with their speech were distant sounds
of turbulent water he stirred uneasily
and awoke

  a faint light shot through the darkness in

a single bar to his amazement a womans
voice rich and full of youth was issuing an
order he listened perplexedly

   bring him up huang you are a stu-
pid daw

  he heard his guide of the night answer
 but if he has the jewels they are ours

   i do not allow murder on my ship
go get him

  tanner drew his revolver then replaced
it in his pocket keeping his hand on it in
readiness for immediate use

   come on now lively you the girl
spoke sharply

  a square sheet of light appeared and in it
huangs face grew distinct peering down
from above

   you must come his voice growled
angrily

  tanner stood up in the chinamans
eyes he read disappointment at least
there was no suspicion of his true identity
the rogue had sought to murder him for the
singapore jewels

    follow the advice of the trustworthy
he mounted the ladder which was now
plainly visible as his head issued from the
hole he glanced around

  the woman was standing a few feet dis-
tant her skirt was blown against her by
the wind setting the lines of her body out
clearly her youth was evident and ra-
diant energy animated her very silence
clear blue eyes studied him intensely while
p mass of black hair hung free in the wind
her straight well-formed lips were com-
pressed and a frown wrinkled her forehead
delightfully

  good morning she spoke perfect
english and tanner realized with increasing
wonder that she was white

   i must apologize for being a stowaway
he ventured at a loss for anything better to
say

   its scarcely worth your while her
manner prohibited an answer

  huang stood by watching them intently
she turned on him suddenly and her eyes
flashed you idiot she snapped to
think he stole the singapore jewels

   but he brought papers from a certain
house in hong kong the chinaman
protested with some asperity
the black dragon



 u go below and leave him with me she
 commanded

    the man hesitated bowed and stole
 away

chapter ii

two dragons

when they were alone she turned
again to tanner  your daring
exceeds your good sense

 i confess i dont quite appreciate-

  dont you i saw you at tokyo two
 years ago when i was there with father so
 you thought to catch me did you

  you  he stared at her in open amaze-
 ment

  i am captain and owner of this craft
 she said

 he was speechless the girl eyed him
 scornfully

  my contempt for you grows momently
 mr government tanner

 he felt his cheeks grow hot under her
 blazing eyes

  i-i thought an irishman owned this
 ship he stammered in a weak attempt at
 justification

  an irish woman does father died
  oh im so sorry he failed to check
 himself in time

  you neednt be im quite as success-
 ful a law-breaker

  i meant that-

  you are my prisoner i should let
 huang knife you as he intended never
 bribe my mate he always tells

 tanner grinned  i had to get aboard
 you know it was my order

  i shall expect you to leave the vessel as
 soon as we touch land you will make no
 attempt to arrest me

  that was part of my instruction he
 admitted

  your orders are reversed by the highest
 authority now recognized

 she turned away from him then came
 back swiftly he wondered at the strength
 so gracefully revealed in the hand she ex-
 tended

  i will appreciate the gift of your re-
 volver

  despite his better judgment his sense of
humor would not be suppressed  i know
no one to whom  would rather present it
captain

  he gave her the gun bowing

  her face did not relax

   it is quite as valuable minus your little
politeness

   like the gun they are forced from me
his eyes met hers frankly her brow con-
tracted then she smiled mischievously

   in return may i ask your presence at
dinner there was a note of amusement
in her voice  i begin to feel the charm of
flattery it cant be resisted you know
 thank you he bowed  may i be
favored with the name of my captain

   my name-why it is a charmed word
in a certain house in hong-kong she
imitated her mates inflection

   i ain not familiar with that place of
such power he laughed suddenly  the
papers were given to me at the manila
office

    shall never deal with that hong-kong
firm again she laughed

   it would seem advisable

   shall we go to my cabin

   but i still lack a name by which to ad-
dress you

   oh i am dana obrien you heard
of my father

  he nodded concealing with difficulty the
start she gave him

   you arent the smuggler obriens
daughter

  they walked along the deck together

   i am are you duly horrified

  he did not answer her clear warm
beauty was creating a complex question in
his mind smuggler obrien had been a
figure among the renegade spirits of the
islands to see his daughter to hear her
well-modulated voice and to realize that she
had both education and culture despite her
breeding was too startlingly unreal

   you are thinking how strange it is
she looked at him and he saw a mysterious
little kindling in the blue depths of her eyes

   i was he admitted and into his own
mind came a dim impression that all this
was somehow natural a part of old mem-
ories or a dream being actually lived


all-story weekly

   i wonder why all this seems so inevita-
ble

  she sat opposite him at the table in her
cabin he looked around interestedly
above the table a great bronze lamp hung
by four chains from the ceiling behind
her the berth creaked slightly to the sway
of the vessel

  the books on her shelf and table re-
vealed her companionship with the master
poets and novelists opposite the book-
case hung a great black dragon tapestry ex-
quisite in workmanship and beauty as he
turned from it their eyes met and answered
each other wonderingly as though the sight
of that dragon had charged the room with
memories too vague for recall

  i know that dragon tanner ex-
claimed in a startled tone

  she stared at him without answering he
grew embarrassed

   of course that was ridiculous he mut-
tered  i never saw it before

  she smiled faintly something inscruta-
ble in the curve of her lips  one would
remember it she said  there isnt an-
other like it it has a peculiar scaled tail
you see and the eyes are speaking intelli-
gence it belonged to father

  he studied it more carefully in the
creatures eyes there was a fascinating sug-
gestion of intelligence a strange disturbing
glint caused by a unique spin of thread
worked through the eyeballs

   it seems to me something i know about
some special story

   have you heard much of the dragon
tales she leaned her elbows on the table
he shook his head negatively

   it isnt likely then that you know of
this one she seemed about to tell him
the story then changing her mind she
laughed  really mr tanner she
chided  you brought the real mystery of
the orient into my cabin how ungovern-
mental 

   im frankly puzzled he told her
 its all familiar this cabin-and yet it
isnt things are-things are not quite
somehow as i should have expected to see
them

  she gave him one swift glance a faint
fear in her eyes then with a shrug she

rose  are you proposing to rearrange my
cabin

  no he answered  no though i could
suggest

   you can suggest nothing her tone
was unnecessarily sharp he noticed that
she had become nervous

   i think she said as though speaking
to herself  that i will put back to manila
despite the protest of huang and leave you
there

  he did not interrupt her after a mo-
ment she walked to the tapestry standing
before it she looked the pictured dragon
squarely in the eyes  or she murmured
quite unaware of tanners stare  i shall
have to blind you you mocker of realities

  watching her tanner felt his blood rush
in a dizzy sweep to his head then he grew
calm again it had seemed to him that he
must have expected her to stand absorbed
before that picture

  he walked over and stood beside her
through the open port-hole the tropical sun
shone upon her black hair and gave it luster
he studied the tapestry carefully for a sec-
ond time

  woven of silken thread it must have
taken years to complete the dragon was
at least six feet long its tail curved slightly
to the right the black armored skin was
edged with a dull gold scarcely discernible

  each scale was lightly touched with it
the head was oddly shaped and the eyes
were a strange red save for that intangible
line of greenish gold in them

  neither spoke suddenly tanner moved
as though under hypnotic control he put
out his hand and lifted the tapestry as he
did so his face became pale and another per-
sonality seemed to possess him on the op-
posite side was the similar dragon gold in
color its scales edged in black its green
eyes streaked with reddish gold

   i thought so he murmured involun-
tarily

   you didnt her contradiction was
almost panicky  you couldnt

  he stared at her blanched fece she too
was changing in her wide eyes he read
the same wondering fear that gave his own
nerves a chill tenseness

   i say you did not how could you
the black dragon



  the room was suddenly alert with intan-
gible thoughts

  he brushed his forehead perplexedly
 no he answered weakly coming to him-
self   couldnt of course

  she did not move abruptly as though
drawn by an irresistible will he left the
cabin

  outside the deck shone under the blazing
sun the ocean was like burnished glass
and the smooth peace of the open sea re-
stored his calm what had taken place
seemed now definitely unreal it was ab-
surd preposterous but why had he lifted
the tapestry

  what had he expected to see had he
been the victim of a hypnotic control

  he paced the deck meditatively at the
back of his brain a persistent taut strain
seemed pulling for possession of his con-
sciousness he lit a pipe resolutely refus-
ing to think of the dragon or of the blue-
eyed girl before it her whimsicality had
prompted some half hypnotic joke upon
him

  she had been amusing herself with east-
ern foolery at his expense well it should
not continue

  huang appeared beside him smiling de-
precatingly  captain obrien begs that
you please excuse her from dinner

   certainly he felt unnecessarily re-
lieved

   you will dine with me in my cabin

   very well he left the mate standing
beside the rail it was growing more dif-
ficult for him to understand his situation
as he walked the deck he asked himself
why he tanner was being treated so hos-
pitably hv the captain who knew his gov-
ernmental position

  true she had said he was her prisoner
but her treatment was not that of a smug-
gler captain toward a detective was she
merely being romantically generous or was
it a love of adventure in her that prompted
this strange conduct

  he was not able to decide resolving
that there must be a reason still unrevealed
he returned to huang

   what is the story of the black dragon
in the cabin he asked abruptly returning
in thought to the mystery of that tapestry

  the orientals face was inscrutable

   there is no story her father ob-
tained the picture somewhere

   i see he knew it was useless to per-
si st

   in but few minutes we dine the
mate smiled

   i shall be delighted he answered and
turned away

  looking back suddenly he caught huang
glaring at him venomously something in
the mans eyes warned him of subtle dan-
gers in that look was a menace of things
distinctly oriental and tanner resolved to
be watchfully alert

chapter iii

the way of fate

a warm wind filled the sails of the
black dragon with speed they
bulged in white bowls their surfaces
glistening under the moon the sea was
aglow with phosphorous and out of the
silent shimmer flying fish leaped in streaks
of gold above the racing vessel the stars
hung like mellow lamps in the liquid black
of the tropical night

  tanner could not sleep the song of the
wind in the taut rigging was like some
strange lute his head felt queer he was
eternally watching the pieces of furniture
half expecting to see the round painted
wood become something different some-
thing old and antique wrought in rosewood
and ornate with precious stones the ex-
pectation haunted him and its vague per-
sistence provoked him to anger

  the heavy army blanket on his bunk
seemed always about to become a rare silk
adorned with grotesque dragon heads at
last he left the cabin no sooner had he
stepped on deck than an ungovernable im-
pulse gripped him a half-felt knowledge
that some one awaited him there pulled his
reluctant feet toward the bow of the ship

  again and again he brushed at his eyes
irritably as though to sweep away some
film of hallucination his mouth was dry
and feverish he told himself repeatedly
that he was a fool a fever-mad idiot and
that he must ask for quinine


all-story weekly

  as he neared the bow his heart beat like
a heavy hammer he could scarcely breathe
she was there standing against the rail her
eyes fixed dreamily on the water ahead

  her black hair fell over a white dress in
waving curls in his mind all sense of
oddity vanished before a deep reverent feel-
ing hastily he stepped beside her and
when he spoke his voice was low and tender
the words came without his being aware of
their meaning until they fell on his ear

   what are you doing here

  her glance never wavered  waiting-
waiting and praying in her voice was a
passionate joy mingled with pain the
rare color of her words burned his con-
sciousness and yet he realized it was not
the girl he knew who spoke he was no
longer tanner the american it was his
control who answered her

  his body trembled uncontrollably and
his lips were parched

   only the magnolia flower can teach the
uselessness of prayer on this ship

   ah but the wild flight she whispered
clasping her hands  we are speeding as
speeds the night to be swallowed in morn-
ing

  his own voice came to him from afar
answering her it is the will of the
master

  her black hair fell over her cheek as she
bowed her head she seemed an oriental
princess

   which is the way to the gate of fulfil-
ment she asked dreamily

  he leaned closer feeling the answer rush
from his lips as though he had longed for
ages to speak the strange personality
governed him  the wise moon smiles
even at lovers knowing their hearts can
but die when their tears are fallen the
wise stars smile even on lovers knowing
that desire is a lie told in the night by a
false friend

  she turned toward him then and her
face-was ashen  wthy do you tell me these
things have i not fled from the place of
the god am i not now free to fulfill our
destiny

  he reached out his arms the arms that
were his and yet not his and she swayed
toward him

   even the winged dragon is powerless
before the kiss of love his hands touched
her shoulders she started shivered and
an inarticulate cry broke from her lips

   stop you-you-what are you doing
the slant of the orient was gone from her
eyes

  he fell back a step before her blazing
anger what they had just spoken he could
not remember it seemed blurred lost in a
swelling tide of common thoughts he
gasped for breath

   i beg vour pardon what-what have
i said

  she leaned against the rail her hands
clasped together

   madness what did we say

  he tried to remember but could not

   you are tanner she stormed vehe-
mently  tanner of the american service
and i am dana dana obrien smuggler
her voice was declarative as though she
assured herself

   i know he faltered  but just now
i-i thought-

   stop it you did not think it neither
did i for heavens sake man are we both
mad we must put an end to this-this
-what is it

   i wish to god i knew ever since
i entered your cabin things have been all
tangled vague chaotic nonsenses are upset-
ting my nerves

   you said you recognized the tapestry
she almost cried

   i lied i never saw that dragon be-
fore

   of course not it was impossible that
you could have

   dana are you playing with me

  she shook her head the distress in her
face was too genuine to be doubted

   we are both mad with fever we must
put back to manila at once manila mod-
ern and western is our salvation she
straightened herself as she spoke

  he wanted to agree but something
gripped his heart and instead he said  we
cannot fate is-

  lies she interrupted fate is a
bugbear of the chinese and we can

  he only stared into her eyes for answer
   for heavens sake man get that look
the black dragon



out of your eyes do you want to lose
yourself remember that you are tanner
of the service you must not forget it or
you may sink into the black maw of that
accursed thing and drag me with you
the abject terror the dominant command
of her voice shook him

   we will put back at once

  she nodded 

   better call your villainous mate and
tell him

  she took one step then paused uncer-
tainly  what shall  say to him

   say you want to put back are you not
the captain

  she nodded before going  listen the
crew may protest they are bent on this
trip for it means big money if they
knew who you really are theyd kill you

   whatever happens one thing must be
done we must not forget that we are go-
ing back to manila she stressed the last
word  we must not see each other
alone

  after a moment he agreed

   now to tell huang she said

   wont you need my support

   no you had best not be seen

   very well he saw her vanish around
the deck-house

  after a moment huang glided into sight
his yellow face wrinkled in a savage grin
so you do not sleep well

  the use of the chinese tongue carried a
sudden terror to tanner as though it
possessed some potent drug in its very
sound

   no too warm in bed tanner turned
away

   you like the southern sea at night
there was a taunting bitterness in the ques-
tioners voice

  the american whirled on him to meet his
mocking eyes  what the devil have you
in your black mind huang

  the chinese made a deprecating ges-
ture his smile was honeyed saffron in
its yellowness  the poetry of the night
is all

  then forget it and leave me alone
  huang bowed and vanished

  no sooner was he gone than tanner
vished him returned although the oily

courtesy of the man annoyed him seek-
ing to reason it out and to discover the
cause of his strange hypnotic state he lit his
pipe and leaned over the rail

  the vessel swept over the sea with a sea-
birds grace in the wake of light behind
her flying-fish leaped from the foamy glow

  his meditation was interrupted by
danas voice speaking in abrupt command
 wait you huang shall  have to kill
you

  he whirled to see her backing toward
him half a dozen frowning chinese follow-
ing led by the mate

   we will go on to java huangs
voice was politeness itself

  as  have said we will return to ma-
nila now all of you get back to your
places i am captain here

   not if we turn roared a giant of a
yellow brute

   we go back if i have to sail this ship
alone

  huang laughed maliciously his black
eyes snapping  why do we turn he
waited for an answer

   because i command it

  there was a moment of tense silence
then huang spoke again  i am no child
to be deceived with lies you are false to
us for love of him i heard to-night

  her body grew rigid tanner stepped
quickly forward

   that is a lie she said her voice low
and vehement

    will not be robbed by a white man
and his girl obrien would curse his
daughter for so easy a conquest

  the exclamation that escaped her lips
was lost in the report of a gun but the
careful chinese had darted aside and the
bullet sang in the night

  huang leaped forward

  tanner met him half-way with a smash-
ing drive of his fist there was a shriek
then tanner went down under a heaving
striking mass of wriggling chinese

  when the squirming ended he was bound
he looked around for dana she too was
tied lying near him on the deck

   now we will go on to java huangs
voice crooned

  they were lifted by the sailors


all-story weekly

   take them to her cabin huang spoke
imperatively

  they were carried below when they
were left alone behind a barred door dana
turned to him wearily her eyes were
deeply shadowed and a weak movement
of her hand betrayed her exhaustion again
her personality seemed to change

 so we must go on and in this room
her words aroused him to instant panic
instinctively his eyes followed hers to the
tapesty to meet the evil gaze of the dragon

   god help us both he muttered
 what is it dana

  she covered her face with trembling
hands  the way of fate she moaned
 and i-i dare not tell

chapter iv

in the cabin

out of an oily gray sea at dawn the
light arose in pallid murkiness the
sun did not appear and the wind
grew to a shrieking gale long wisps of
black cloud like serpentine forebodings
writhed across the sky dull gray masses
of water heaved in sullen rollers their edges
crested with a leaping tangle of spindrift

  the day was besmirched with somber
grays pale yellowish white and smothering
black even the tumbling clouds wore
grotesque forms

  to the two sitting in silence in the cabin
the scene was pregnant with desperate
meanings every wretched color struck
their eyes with fearful heart-throbbing sug-
gestions things potentially dreadful rose
in unformed images to their minds

  the vessel lunged through the hissing
water like a panic-stricken thing the
great bronze lamp above the table swayed
dizzily its metal adornments clicking out
faint vibrating tones the tapestry quiv-
ered in trembling lines while the dragon
squirmed fiendishly irresistibly both pairs
of human eyes turned again and again to
meet its wicked red orbs

  silence had clutched them with chilling
power between their fitful attempts at
talk long intervals lapsed some dread
force had settled in the room to brood like

nameless horror over them tanner could
see danas eyes gleaming with a strange
light and he knew that his own answered
that unnatural glow

  at last she broke the silence desperately
 my god she cried  its all so natural
-so much as if we had done this before
tell me that we havent the pleading
eagerness in her voice moved him power-
fully

  you know we never saw each other be-
fore he said through burning lips

  i know but the evidence is all oppos-
ing that knowledge

   could it be some trick of huangs
he spoke hopefully  is he one of those
chinese jugglers of human soul stuff
isnt it possible

  her laugh was too terrible he shud-
dered

  she leaned toward him suddenly her eyes
aflame  no she answered hoarsely  it
isnt huang

   then what is it

  she tossed back her hair with an aban-
doned gesture into her face color rushed
and the lines of her cheek and nose were ac-
centuated

   if i told you you would not believe

   i would believe anything dana any-
thing-only explain it if you can

  she did not move her look grew mys-
terious through the film of her tears he
saw her expression growing dreamily inti-
mate a glory of passion smoldered in her
eyes her words became melodious

  he knew from the altered quality of her
voice that it was not dana who spoke but
some newr some other yet familiar person-
ality

  the revelation awoke startling wild
cadences in him he felt his own conscious-
ness swirl toward obscurity and into its
place crowded a different soul warm ar-
dent thoughts leaped into life his body
twitched with the drive of a sweeping
emotion

   it is the master who dares deny his
power she was now the girl he had seen
in the cabin before the dragon

  tanner tried to speak but what he would
have said died instead he laughed a
fiercely passionate laugh of recklessness
the black dragon



   have i not dared deny all things
all things but love

   when the rice fields bloom again love
is a new-born child answered the girl who
was not dana

   i am the master of love who speaks
of spring it is my heart and that is ever
in the bloom my flower of all rare blooms
he boasted

  her laugh was the rich music of delighted
passion

   we ride gray seas together ah it is
good to live

  he started violently her words had
shaken him with a rushing fear of disaster
a premonition of death he was entirely
oriental in his reactions suddenly he
knew he must be chinese he loved dana
yet she was not dana but an oriental
princess and he he was-yes he was an
outlaw

   why do you speak of life we who
are doomed-

 stop she cried we are not
doomed love will outride the sea

  he smiled happily he knew

   i believed that once answered the pi-
rate who was tanner

  at his reply she sank into her chair
trembling

   once she repeated  once and now
now you look happy that you do not be-
lieve

   no i was dreaming of that time

   what dreams tell me what did you
dream

  she was leaning forward as though to
urge his speech faster

   i cannot there are no words to speak
that thought

   and you who had all words to speak
all thoughts say that

  i i never had such power to speak
   ah then you do not remember

  she was half conscious of their sur-
roundings seeming to be divided between
two warring selves he could not tell how
much of what she said was dana how
much some other woman speaking through
those lips he was not certain of his own
words or their origin

   we are captives of huang he mut-
tered to assure himself

 her eyes darkened but her answer was

 an enigma

  always he drives us on and on like
 the great plague of time

  huang he repeated  your first mate
 on the smuggling ship the black dragon
 they both glanced toward the tapestry
 fearfully

 that is it she exclaimed tear it
 from the wall then we can defy all things
 it has been our curse too long

 neither moved paralysis held them

  we dare not my wonderful he an-
 swered despite his will

  does the freest man in- the empire
 say he dares not

 her voice was a mocking caress he
 sprang to his feet

  dana he shouted at her unnecessarily
  dana you are mad

 she smiled sweetly at him  i am not
 mad my friend i am bowing to the in-
 evitable

  you talk of things i know nothing
 about

  we both talk of things we only vaguely
 know about

  but i will not i will not be such a
 fool

 her head sank wearily on the table
 such utter abandon to despair he had never
 seen it wrung his heart timidly he
 caressed her hair as a man soothes a child

  there there girl he  crooned  we
 will come through all this

  perhaps we will

  i know we will and when we do i will
 tell you something dana

 she looked up wonderingly  what is
 it

  i am too tangled in my mind to attempt
 it now i never know quite whether i
 tanner or some other will speak through
 my lips

  i know her eyes were moist  i
 too am afraid to talk

 huang came in then smiling suave
 carrying breakfast neither spoke to him

  i serve myself he explained  there
 is no other i dare trust and you both have
 things i must know so i protect you

  you villain tanner said through set
 teeth


all-story weekly

  huang smiled good-humoredly  i have
long wanted to be master of this ship be
grateful that i spare your lives and land
you safe together  had dreamed his
yellow face grew dark  of having a wife
who had been my captain but that cannot
be she is white and a fool when white
men appear

  ugh dana shuddered convulsively

   you get out of here or ill throw you
out tanner rose fiercely

   i am going and i leave your break-
fast the man bowed smiling graciously
as he closed the door

  tanner arranged the food and spoke to
the girl  will you eat dana

  she shook her head emphatically he sat
alone at the table while she threw herself
on her bed to rest

  all day the ship rolled through heavy
seas all day in that cabin they waged
a weird battle against mysteries at times
they were lost utterly in speech neither
understood always they recovered when
the strange delirium brought them into ac-
tual touch of each other

  night came down in a thick blackness
unlit by star or moon huang had not ap-
peared all clay now he glided in and si-
lently placed the dinner on the table then
striking a match he lit the lamp a rare
light played in the room and every scale
of the dragon glistened huang had been
drinking and he stood a moment leering

   i think perhaps he said  i yet want
my wife

  tanner rose the oil ip the lamp was
some chinese preparation and its burning
emitted a rich delicate perfume

  shakily tanner advanced a step toward
the chinaman

  huang smiled and turned toward the
door  in a little while  will return and
we will test the west my white man
against the east

  he was gone

  dana sat at the table

  in her movement of hand and arm a
languor became apparent

  the perfume filled the cabin his head
was aching desperately

   dana he pleaded  tell me what it is
lhat i feel

  after a moment she answered him in a
soft voice the strange eastern voice he
had come to know

   so you will war once more for her
soul you two and then-

   then what who will war

  she did not answer tanner sat oppo-
site eating listlessly the vessel rolled
more violently now the creaking of the
berth was plainly audible in the cabin
where the lampburned steadily there was
intense silence

  over his food tanner saw things indis-
tinctly despite his will everything grew
obscurely different he watched thm
intently thoughts of his own grew less
coherent then suddenly he started star-
ing wide-eyed he caught his breath

 dana be cried agonizingly  dana
his hand went out to her in pleading
she reached hers toward him they met in
a tight clasp both turned toward the
dragon

  a long time passed before their eyes
the articles of the room danced in a whirl
of vaguenesses

  suddenly he stood erect laughing heart-
ily she smiled up at him her eyes closed
save for a narrow brilliant slit her black
hair fell half over her face he shook her
hand playfully then in a rush everything
went black oblivion swallowed him

chapter v

in the fast

in the cabin of the black dragon a great
bronze lamp carved with elaborate ar-
tistry and set with precious stones
swayed gently its rare violet light shed a
strangely subtle perfume through the room
where the rays fell on the teakwood table
delicate patterns of inlaid onyx and jade
spoke tangibly of the owners high-born
estate

  against the wall to the right of the door
stood a great mahogany case its shelves
were heaped with rare old parchments all
neatly arranged and bound in heavy leather
studded with jewels the deep luxury of
the berth was finely colored with beautiful
silks while a rustling silk curtain orna-
the black dragon



mented with gold embroidery swayed
around it

  on the left wall a great lustrous silken
tapestry hung woven cunningly to picture
a dragon black as jet save for a thin gold
edge around each scale who looked out
upon the room with red eyes through which
a greenish gold thread was strangely spun

  before the symbol of his god yahn tsing
lee who was tanner prayed he was a
superb specimen of manhood and the dark
skin which had marked him from youth
wras smooth and fine his deep almond
eyes were brilliant with feeling which played
in their depth in ever-varying quality

  his strong clasped hands glittered with
diamonds he was clad in wondrous spun
silks thick and delicate and his wrists
and collar were heavily worked in gold
while the deep soft shade of his tunic was
soothing to the eye even as he prayed
one saw that he was an athlete supple and
strong

  beside him knelt dana now latiea the
princess fairest of chinas women

  yahn was listening to the warm color
of her voice as she prayed aloud his
glance stole to her ivory face so richly
colored in lip and eyes such a
mouth as she had roses of passion
bloomed upon her lips her black curls fell
over white-clad shoulders like a shower of
rich perfume

  the curve of her throat was delicately
strong and the ripe fulness of youth heaved
in her swelling breasts her hands too
were jeweled diamonds upon fine slender
hands so warm in their passion for him

   oh master of life she prayed her
ardent tone rising in melodious supplica-
tion  grant yahn his prayer give it to
us oh mighty one to the full of the wine
of love let not lips of lovers ever tire or
the hunger of lovers hearts ever cease i
beseech you give it to yahn to love and
love with the freedom of great-hearted pas-
sion make me not unable to answer his
will for i am his woman his all

  they bowed in silent worship a moment
then hand in hand they rose and crossed to
the table

  drawing up a great chair inlaid with
ivory and jewels yahn drew his latiea

down beside him tenderly his strong hand
stroked her slender one with timid courage

   ah my own it has been deep red this
day of victory

  her eyes were stars of passion burning
full for him

   the blood of the guardians of latiea
will wtash clean the sin of her theft the
dragon will bless yahn my beloved

 wild was the tumult but wilder still
with desire i knew no peace till your lips
were the cooling fire i drank in triumph
 and afoon-are you sure he will aban-
don his dream

   is he not under the command of
yahn who has given him bread and the
rare chance to do brave deeds he is my
friend my follower

  she laughed tenderly stroking his cheek
the while

   heart that has conquered my heart is
the face of latiea so soon forgotten by one
whose mouth yearned to drink kisses

  he joined in her laugh making merry
with her bright eyes

   even the heart of my passionate pure
one knows vanity

   i know love and it teaches me fear
for my lover

  he leaned toward her his eyes growing
wild with desire she saw and her own
expressive orbs were glories of love with
a sigh half fainting in its fierce yielding
she swayed to his lips gripped in sheer
agony of desire they clung lip to lip as
though fearful of parting

   i have stolen the blossom of chinas
great throne and the wrath of the fathers
may fall but i love her

   she is but breath to her yahn a word
he has spoken in dream

   a pirate chieftain has done ill to pre-
sume in such fashion

   the dragon loves courage and passion
in yahn is he not always victor who
reads with more wisdom or speaks with
more poetry

   love blinds even a princess to the
weakness of her adored one

   i have offered my life to the dragon
my virtue is his and my prayer does not
love as we know it become worship

he threw back his great leonine head in a


all-story weekly

gesture of reckless defiance  away with
fear of the gods i am yahn and  love
let him who is weak deny his passion
yahn takes what he wants from whoever
has

   ah now speaks my captain of great ad-
ventures and high powers

   and now speaks his love and his
mate

  the door of the cabin opened and a
chinaman stood on the threshold he was
clad as a seaman and his wicked eyes blazed

   in a certain house in hong-kong it is
said the black dragon knows a master who
can brook no denying his words were
slowly spoken

  true afoon yahn did not move
latiea watched narrowly

   then let him beware of the wrath of the
dragon

   what knows afoon of the power he
invokes

  the man laughed villainously  he has
dreamed of a wife who should sail as a
queen 

   afoon yahns voice rumbled omi-
nously  let not the spirit of folly sway
the brain of my friend with useless de-
sires

   who says thev are useless

   yahn

  the great man rose with tigerlike speed
latiea sat silently watching

   then by his word let him stand if he
dares turn the tapestry and sail to the
spice isles with the yellow dragon watching
your love

  yahn latiea sprang up  do not
heed him oh be not rashly tempted
even yahn dares not defy his luck god

   afoon the captains eyes burned  we
have long been friends and you served in
a riot of life under me your passion has
stolen your brain but for the love that i
bear you i will prove that your yellow
dragon favors my winning latiea princess
of our land

  if you do we are lost oh my own
she was on her knees before him stoop-
ing he lifted her with proud love in his
face

   if we reach the spice island you will
be content he faced afoon

   to serve as a dog in yahns vessel for-
ever afoon smiled

  deftly yahn turned the tapestry the
yellow dragon stared from his green eyes
streaked with red the vessel moved into
the night hands trembled over her eyes
and latiea sobbed in the chair

   this night oh beloved you have sealed
our loves doom silence fell in the
cabin while the yellow dragon shone in the
violet light the great voyage was begun
yahn smiled defiantly daring the sea the
chinaman turned with a harsh laugh

chapter vi

shipwreck

at dawn the pale light rose out of a
gray oiled sea a shrieking gale
swept the vessel on through the foam-
capped rollers

  in the cabin yahn stood beside the deep
berth looking down upon the flowerlike face
of latiea her eyes opened wonderingly

   yahn she murmured  is the yellow
dragon still there

   still my beloved and the- luck of
yahn holds

  her lips curved in gracious tenderness
her arms rose toward him

  he felt his heart swell as he saw their
delicate beauty

   ah is the dawn so gray for envy of
my love

   the black clouds are as yahns dragon
to-day when he hides his god the sky
creates new ones

  he bent over her his deep eyes alight
 latiea who is there who can speak the
sum of my love

   yahn she answered letting her arms
fall around his neck  nay yahn is with-
out voice the desire is as silence un-
fathomed

  their lips met in a rapture of love
then as a knock sounded at the door
yahn rose

   who knocks

   afoon would seek advice

   speak then i am listening

   would it not be best to shorten sail
the gale blows desperately
the black dragon



  yahn glanced at the yellow dragon
tapestried on the wall

   put on more sail i am eager to make
the spice islands dbes the wind not blow
to be used

  they heard afoon going from the door
yahn turned again to latiea  to-night
we laugh at afoons yellow god in the
jeweled harbor of the spice island

   may the words of yahn be true an
infinite pathos spoke in her voice her
eyes glistened with tears

  i am afraid yahn the sea speaks of
danger my heart is oppressed with
fears

  he laughed defiantly standing erect de-
spite the jerking lunge of his ship  i am
child of the sea and her master

  sitting at the table he watched latiea
dress his keen eyes were warm with joy
in her beauty

   the form of latiea is the morning
her beauty is as the dawn

  her laughter was happy though she
turned away to hide embarrassment

   even the nightingale envies her voice
in laughter

   my pirate speaks as a poet among his
roses

   there is no poet who can tell of the
true beauty of latiea

  she came to his side moving with alert
grace

   ah the desire of love is but heightened
by union of lovers

  he caught her to his breast smothering
her rosebud mouth with kisses the vessel
rolled more desperately overhead the
sails boomed like crackling thunder under
the driving wind

  all day the lovers talked of their joy
though there were times when the girls face
grew shadowed as she glanced at the yellow
dragon night came afoon called yahn
on deck

  he was plunged in a swirl of hissing
water that swept the vessel from bow to
stern his great laugh was boyishly eager
 ha old mother he challenged the sea
 you are too boisterous at play know you
not latiea rides the black dragon to-
night

  among his men he worked making fast

the rigging they were sullen and he heard
grumbling among them as they toiled

   what has turned the peace of my crew
to anger

   we sailed under the guard of the black
dragon on the wall who is the man who
dares turn him away for a yellow god of
afoon

  yahn stood among them eyes blazing
with wrath

   has not the crew of yahn tsing lee
been made rich with spoil has not his
ship sailed storm-mad seas who among
you is a friend to fear

  they made no answer but their glances
were evil yahn turned to his cabin with a
harsh laugh

   let any who is tired of my law speak
and he leaves me at the spice island to-
night

  the men shifted uneasily then a great
brute of a seaman laughed

   we will see no spice island this night

  yahn turned on him like a tiger

   dawn finds us safe in the jeweled har-
bor and at peace there you shall end
your time

  the giant turned away muttering

  for two hours they worked like demons
increasingly heavy seas pounded aboard the
ship the night was ink black only the
skill of his crew could have waged such
war the vessel staggered under reeling
sail again and again the course was lost
to be regained by yahn who held the wheel
down with titan arms

  then through the night a wild cry rose
at the same time the ponderous crash of
storm-mad breakers shook the dense dark-
ness yahn sprang to his cabin door it
was fastened against him

  the vessel plunged in a spinning aban-
don the sailors shouted heedless of the
wheel yahn threw himself against the
door under the impact of his great shoul-
der it broke

  he leaped inside latiea crouched terror-
stricken in the far corner her hands up-
lifted above her his yellow face mad with
passion eyes burning with desire afoon
towered

  latiea screamed as his hand closed on her
wrist the yellow dragon tapestry writhed


all-story weekly

 venomously its red eyes wickedly gleaming
 in the violet light yahn sprang upon his
 mate 	

   afoon was an agile man and strong
 the two fought desperately for the freedom

-	of life and latiea over the cabin now
 knee-deep in an inrush of water they
 lunged their fierce eyes blazed hate

   at last yahn got his mates throat in his
 viselike hands the great body of afoon
 quivered grewt tense and crumpled with
 a grunt of disgust the pirate chieftain
 flung him into the black heave of water that
 rolled back from the door

   latiea my rose of china where are
 you

    he turned to catch her in his love-fearful
 arms her eyes were alight with passion

    we will ride the mad sea to our hearts
 desire

    who knows the way yahn to the gate
 of fulfilment

    only the magnolia flower has power to
 still the heart of love

   their lips met then came a grinding
 crash the cabin floor buckled under them
 a great roar filled their ears still cling-
 ing to latiea yahn felt himself go down
 in a frenzy of raging water when he came
 up she was clinging about his neck her
 cry reached him above the chaos of the
 storm

    we shall never sleep in the harbor of
 jeweled delight

   he made no answer with set teeth
 he began swimming hours passed in that
 wild battle in the black sea of wrath
 fainter and fainter became his stroke then
 at last in a gasping cry of despair he
 closed the unconscious form of latiea in his
 arms and went down oblivion swallowed
 him

   under a plain bronze lamp swaying vio-
 lently in the cabin of that black dragon
 a common board table glowed dully a
 case full of books rocked in its place against
 the wall opposite a tapestry hung on
 which a yellow dragon woven in rare silk
 writhed venomously in the vessels crazy
 lurching

   tanner lifted his aching head from the
 table his eyes burned while in his mouth

a strange taste lingered his brain reeled
with memories of a mad dream just ended
then the yellow dragon met his eyes his
last memory had been of a black dragon
and dana

  with an exclamation of alarm still
under the spell of a wild dream he sprang
across the room and turned the tapestry
the black dragon looked out at him once
more from reddish eyes shot with a strange
line of greenish gold

  he turned warned by some intangible
sense

  she was lying upon the berth her black
hair falling in a sheen across the pillow
why had he no remembrance of her being
there her face was drawn and white
while tears still shone on her closed lashes

  he stepped toward her then from his
crouching posture beside the berth huang
rose ominously his eyes aflame with mad
desire tanner met his glance and it was
evident that the chinaman was frenzied
with drink

   you fool the oriental crooned  she
is mine white though she be

  tanner did not answer only a short
laugh shook him as he leaped

  they met and swayed desperately under
the impact of fighting muscles the ship
lurched jerked and reeled above the noise
of their battle a chaotic thunder roared
desperately tanner struggled for the china-
mans throat he had a strangely confident
sense of familiarity the man was agile
and strong and tanner felt his lithe body
twisting free in a last supreme effort he
gripped huangs throat in his iron hands

  they writhed nearer the door it burst
open and a demoniac riot of hissing water
surged knee-deep into the cabin in a deafen-
ing uproar of wind and water

  tanner felt huang stiffen then the body
of the chinaman became limp with a grunt
of disgust he hung the body into the black
torrent raging beyond the door

   dana he shouted turning  where
are you

  she was sitting up in bed staring at him
and at the black dragon tapestry swinging
perilously on the wall

   the ship is lost dana-look at the
water
the blacfp dragon



  she sprang to her feet with a heart-break-
ing cry  again must we go down in
this sea

  he felt the words with shivering force
then his face grew tense  no by
heaven he said  we will not

  a grinding shock tore the monotonous
tumult of breakers with a sharper sound
the vessel buckled under them he caught
dana in his arms then over their heads
a frenzied chaos of water closed when he
came up dana was clinging about his neck
he took her arms and tore her free

   dana he shouted into her ear  if
you hold me that way we drown put your
hands on my shoulders and dont grip me
too tightly

  she obeyed her face like a drawn white
flower before his eyes without a word he
began swimming

  hours passed feebler grew his stroke
at last he felt that he could go no
farther then the sea caught him and swept
him up with a cry dana gripped his
shoulders they were rolled over and over
dragged along a sandy beach and dashed
safely up beyond the reach of the water

   dana he shouted  we are safe this
time

  she laughed deliriously and sank uncon-
scious at his feet

chapter vii

the black dragons work

not far from the point where tanner
and dana had washed ashore stood
an old temple no one knew who had
built it a long-dead race must have reared
it to their god the tropical growth con-
cealed yet adorned its crumbling walls with
flower and vine so that it was now a shel-
tering arbor of riotous red blossoms whose
scented petals fell in perfumed color upon
the rough altar

  for years a chinese priest had made it
his hermitage the islanders enshrined him
in a mystic faith and loved him with its
assurance to him all troubles came his
wrrinkled old face dry and yellow was lit
with smoldering eyes from which the wis-
dom of a village secret shone in his sim-

ple life all tilings were made to seem kind-
ly and through his advice many a troubled
native had attained peace

  it was his habit to wander daily along
the beach this morning shambling
through the sand eyes bent in meditation
he came upon two white bodies without
excitement the old man bent over them
as he studied their faces his lips curved in
a strange smile

   fate he muttered  the glorious an-
cestor has seen fit to use me

  his eyes filled with a dreamy haze with
infinite care he set to work over the girl
who at last opened her eyes their cloudy
blue depths were oddly veiled with wonder
the old man smiled amiably

   so you came out of the sea he mur-
mured  life will go on

  a look of fear crossed the girls face
but the priest had turned to fanner she
watched him chafing the strong arms now
lying limp in a gesture of exhaustion

  after an interminable time the american
opened his eyes they were full of the
same vague questioning that haunted those
of the girl the priest nodded as though
confirming some idea

   dana tanner muttered seeking her
with his vacant glance  where are you
that rascal has drugged us where are
we

  at first her moving lips emitted no sound
then as she struggled to a sitting position
her voice came gropingly

   the black dragon is gone-gone for-
ever into the sea we are alive oh
mighty silence we have escaped

  the priest stooped to lift her to her feet
his manner was reverent

   the black dragon he crooned softly
 lives always on land and sea with his
support the girl stood tottering while tan-
ner rose

   you will need rest and food the old
man continued  and help in your hour of
thought come to my altar

  silently as though afraid to speak they
walked beside him neither glanced toward
the other some powerful conviction a
feeling of fear lest their eyes betray a dread-
ful truth kept them awkwardly staring at
the ground


all-stoot weekly

  the priest supported their faltering steps
as they entered the foiest beyond the beach
in silence they came to the altar and sat
down

  without a word the chinaman set about
preparing food tanner watched him with
indifferent eyes it seemed to him that he
must speak yet his tongue refused to utter
the words crowding his brain

  dana moved restlessly their eyes met
a swift darling look of inquiry passed be-
tween them as though to deny its impli-
cation tanner shook his head

   dana he said  are you feeling bet-
ter

  she nodded letting her lids hide the
warmth that came in her eyes

  u we had a hard pull of it there in the
water he spoke hesitatingly she did
not answer in desperation he drew his will
taut

   that villain huang he asserted more
vehemently than the statement required
must have drugged our food he brought
it to us you know

  li then you do remember-everything
she did not look at him her voice was
timid fearful yet toned with joy

   yes that is the queer part of it i do
   it is all incredible

   it is still there is a drug in china
that can do that one always remembers
the dreams it stimulates

   i know she whispered  the older
chinese used to make it of-of magnolia
blossoms her voice fell at the mention
of the flower

   huang put it in our dinner that last
meal dana there can be no other ex-
planation you agree dont you his
appeal was almost pathetic

   yes she said after a pause what
else could it be

  the priest came to them then his in-
scrutable smile lit with kindliness here
is rice he said  eat first then talk if
you choose

  while they ate he sat before his idol
staring fixedly up at the grim face his
own features became rigid and grotesque
as they finished he spoke without pre-
liminary he began an odd chant they
listened their faces expressive of surprise

   in the days of long ago he began
crooning u the black dragon lived among
men he was the guardian friend of mighty
men

  tanner stole a glance at dana her lids
were closed

  the priest moved swiftly from a pouch
he poured violet powder upon the altar
then as fanner stared be produced a mi-
nute black dragon carved from a block
of jade it was a delicately formed minia-
ture of the tapestry tanner knew so well
the priest smiled placing the dragon at the
back of the altar still crooning a chant
he set fire to the powder a soft subtly
suggestive perfume pervaded the air

  the old mans hands were moving rhyth-
mically to his chant as the powder burned
tanner became drowsy he strove
in vain to resist the languor his
lids drooped he sank forward then
suddenly became erect his open eyes
were startlingly brilliant opposite him
dana was opening her eyes the same splen-
dor lighting them

  above their heads the blue smoke from
the powder spread thinly as they watched
it seemed to curve downward around them
they did not speak nor was there wonder
as they watched slowly a blue hemisphere
a miniature sky enclosed them the world
was shut away beyond that film of hollow
blue

  their eyes turned simultaneously toward
the priest he crouched before the altar
singing a low wild melody when they saw
the altar their glances stayed instinctively
their hands went out and clasped the
priest ceased his song

  quite without will the eyes of tanner
and dana remained fixed upon the dragon
a long pause followed the priests chant
then as he began again the mouth of the
dragon opened from it came tiny figures
that began enacting a double drama upon
the altar the priest began a low sweet
melody which changed to a rapid narrative

  the figures on the altar gathered in two
groups each surrounded by its own scenery
tanner saw himself as a boy in his old
home portrayed by one group while the
other enacted a strange play in some scented
garden of china
t

the black dragon



  the play continued till tanner was es-
corted aboard the black dragon then
the two groups drew nearer their scenes
blended into one and side by side the story
of yahn tsing lee was portrayed with
that of tanner and dana while the priest
told the old chinese taje

  breathless the watchers listened their
hands gripped tightly the story and the
strange drama ended simultaneously si-
lence swelled the blue hemisphere till it
broke the outer world became visible and
the priest still smiling stole behind his
idol

  danas grip relaxed tanner turned to-
ward her swiftly her eyes were wet with
tears and shone with a vivid light of love

   dana he cried tempestuously  what
is all this

   i cannot explain her voice was
liquid tanner felt drawn to her

   the jtory he told-the play there on
the altar-what does it mean

  from behind the idol the priests voice
answered  out of the mouth of the black
dragon keeper of spirits in time came the
great gift of life to lovers it ended too
soon and the great silence the black
dragon has given the life again

  he was gone they saw him vanish
among the vines beyond the temple

the

    it is impossible tanner shook himself
 vigorously

    yes she answered  and yet  knew
 the story pi yahn it is an old old tale

    but we are white and aryans of mod-
ern time

    i know it is so difficult to under-
 stand

    he burned something was it the-drug
 of magnolia

    i dont know she was silent a min-
 ute then  does it matter her voice
 was passionately tender her eyes burned
 as they met his

   dana he held out trembling arms
to her she came with a suppressed cry of
joy their lips met in a long wild kiss
from the great overhanging blossoms a
shower of crimson petals sprinkled her
black hair they laughed like happy chil-
dren

    if huang did drug us he said softly
  and  still believe he did i am certainly
 grateful his drug taught us love

   her lips sought his as she answered
and theblack dragon gave us life to make
glorious with the knowledge oh i am so
happy 

   he drew her close whispering passionate
 endearments  yes he said  and we are
 beginning to-day my princess

preceding chapters briefly retold

john axson a young man of extraordinary strength of both body and mind but exceedingly
ugly had been taken from his tenement home and his tubercular mother and his thieving
father as a little child and trained and educated at the expense of james gordon windsor rd

    windsor had sent for axson and for the first time in his life he looked upon the face of
the man to whom he owed a debt of gratitude which hurt him like hot iron windsor explained
that he had reached the end of his financial string and was soon to cross the border no
windsor had ever worked and his son james had been bred in the tradition of wealth and
culture but he had selected and educated axson to supply his son with funds to continue to
live in the style to which he had been accustomed when james gordon windsor th made a
profitable marriage the connection could be terminated his benefactor explained to axson that
under the circumstances of his birth he would certainly have become a thief and he had merely
provided that he could steal with security however just as he himself could never knowingly
have lived on stolen goods so neither could his son he bound axson never to reveal to young
windsor the source of his income but the old man desired that the two lads should live
together after his death young windsor a typical spendthrift of the city harmless and good-
natured was both attracted and repulsed by axson however they made a manage together
and axson was at once confronted with windsors need of money after his fathers self-inflicted
death

    having proved his physical prowess in a boxing bout with windsor the latter was immensely
attracted to axson and axson in turn for the first time in his life was brought within the radius
of human companionship and human friendship axson had to plunder but he would plunder
for the sake of another

    regaining consciousness windsor reached his locker and there found a note from axson saying
he would be at the flat the next day with the money for the leffingwell debt

    on the strength of a newspaper account of the mcintosh diamond robbery axson went to
call at the shop of ainsmith  faulkner from whose safe the gems had been stolen the robbers
had left a note signed with the mysterious signature of the xxx the sign manual of a famous
gang of thieves who for five years had operated without a single member falling into the clutches
of the law

    the same evening axson called at a quiet house on fifty-seventh street where he had an
interview with three men volner norton and louis masters nonplused at his demands they
nevertheless complied by handing over forty thousand dollars in cash for the mcintosh diamonds
which he gave them before their wonder ceased gordon their confidential man was brought
in bloody and battered

    when windsor became anxious over his financial state axson advised him to go in for an
heiress promising him twenty thousand dollars for his campaign he also advised bacon their
new butler that his picture was kept at the rogues gallery that he came from volner and
carried a gun he got bacons promise to be his man

    after three days absence windsor came to axson and reported he had fallen desperately in
love with elizabeth dorn he could not press his suit because her engagement to a brilliant
young man of leisure louis masters was to be announced in three hours mrs dorn had been
engaged to young masterss father but had dropped him because he had come to the house
intoxicated all dorn women hated drink after his fathers death young masters had been at
home in the dorn household and this engagement would consummate mrs dorns lifetime
ambition the young man was crazy about the girl but she was still indifferent to all men
her emotions had never been aroused axson assured windsor in three hours societ would know
the private engagement of louis masters and elizabeth had been broken

this story began in the all-story weekly for may 


the frigate bird



  axson went at once to masterss apartment after chugging the man with whiskey they started
for the dorn place on long island arrived there axson sent his man into the house and then
hid in a kind of grotto while watching the house a door opened into the grotto and axson
encountered a beautiful young woman whom he felt had at the same time as she entered his
dark retreat opened for the first time a door inside his soul

    axson spoke to the woman and calmed her fears though he confessed he was a fugitive she
wrought so upon him that he secured her promise that he might come again in the night and
speak to her

    then he returned to the apartment where windsor found him on his return from the dorn
ball he gave axson a graphic account of the evenings sensation when masters walked into
l he rooms and announced to mrs dprn he was repaying his fathers debt by breaking his engage-
ment with elizabeth later he said htf had danced with elizabeth and she seemed strangely
interested in criminology

    masters sought sanctuary in the house of martha perce whom he tried to convince he had
broken with the dorns to resume his old partnership with her he explained his burning passion
for axsons death and asked the womans aid his intensity of hatred led the woman to think
the dorn girl was in some way mixed up with axson

    windsor in a wild intoxication of summer madness had proposed to elizabeth and then
got his dismissal axson urged him to write a letter and himself composed the document
windsor was loath to use another mans burning words to persuade her and called it stolen fire
but in the end was persuaded

   in the middle of the night axson woke to find a person in his room the light disclosed a
woman in a mask bending over the foot of his bed with a gun in her hand axson guessed she
had been sent by masters but he could not guess the tale the woman told was acting to arouse
his sympathies martha perce got him to confess he was moved to pity for the first time in
his life he promised to aid he at any risk   am a fool said axson deliberately  who had
room in his heart for only one dream and -when that was gone he was willing to throw his
heart away after it	s

the spider

a little later martha perce hurried
up the steps to her own house she
 knew that louis masters waited in-
side for her her eyes on fire at the
thought her cheeks flamed in turn she
paused at the door to rub busily with a
handkerchief on her cheeks and rearrange
her hair with swift dexterous pats then
she unlocked the door and entered and went
straight into the living-room

  there she found masters standing bolt-
upright in the center of the room his face
livid white his hands clenched at his sides
the fire which had been blazing merrily
when she left the house earlier in the eve-
ning was now a heap of cold embers she
knew in an instant that the man had sat
there with his hopes and fears all the eve-
ning waiting dreading he had heard her
key in the fuont door now he stood be-
fore her with his heart in his throat waiting
she would not leave him in that deadly
suspense

   sit down take it easy louis she said
 ive won i played your game and hes
mine 

the color came slowly up in his face
perspiration burst out upon his forehead

gleaming the tensed muscles relaxed he
sighed he smiled it was like an awaken-
ing of the dead

   martha he said huskily  you are
wonderful-divine 

   divine or demoniac she answered
gloomily throwing off her coat  start up
the fire louis my moods cool-my
hearts cold its been a rotten night louis
rotten 

  he obeyed her without a word he was
whistling as he piledup the tinder and
the eyes of martha perce blazed with scorn
and then with tenderness as she looked
down upon him at last he was through
the flame rose high he placed her chair
close to the fire and then stood behind it
while she spread out her trembling hands
toward the warmth

   now he said at length since she vol-
unteered  no information what hap-
pened

   i got an idea louis she said calmly
 that were sending to hell a man thats
worth both of us rolled into one yes the
two of us-the whole three xl

   very likely chuckled masters  but
what happened martha

   just the way we planned it said the
girl  you said no matter how i came at
him i couldnt take him by surprise


all-story weekly

well i didnt believe you i framed the
place and went into it like a leaf on the
wind he couldnt possibly have heard me
not possibly understand and he was
sound asleep i could tell that when i en-
tered by the sound of his breathing

   so i soft-shoed it across the floor with
my gat ready id made up my mind
louis to get him with the gat

  good girl murmured masters and
patted her shoulder

  she shook off his hand and then reached
up swiftly and caught it in a convulsive
clasp	f

   pretty soon his breathing stopped
that should have warned me youd say
but i tell you louis there hadnt been a
sound not a creak of the door-not a
whisper of the carpet under my foot-not
even the stir of my dress id gone forward
an inch at a time

   and there was no noise from the bed

i	went on my hand touched the foot of
the bed i crouched and got the flash ready
to take a peek one glimpse of him and
the gat would do the talking you know i
never miss

   and just then there was a snap-the
room flooded with light-i whirled and
found myself looking into a big forty-five

  cold good heavens louis this fire
cant take the chill of it out of my blood

	 and the face behind the gun nearly
finished me when i got a good look at it
you told me he was ugly but i didnt ex-
pect to meet a mask of the devil

   he was perfectly calm about it youd
have thought that it was the most ordinary
thing for him to meet a burglar in his room
at night he made me sit down

   i had not a ghost of a hope that our
cock-and-bull story would work on him
to tell you the truth louis im sure that
under ordinary conditions those unmerciful
eyes of his would have looked straight
through me and that silly story about
 glad  and  larry but hes been upset
recently by something i think the poor
devil is tortured in some way at any rate
he was blind to me the minute he found
out-or thought he found out-that i was
suffering yes louis i felt as if i were
talking with a machine-an invincible ma-

chine-when i first saw him but then i
tried that down-and-out gag and it worked
perfectly oh he was cautious at first but
in a moment or so he wasnt trying to see
through me he was taking every word i
said for full measure i tell you he was
easier than any fool youd pick off the
street for a strong man louis when he
begins to weaken goes with a smash

   well i told him the whole story of
larry and glad just as you planned it for
me youre a clever demon louis and
you guessed at his weak spot before i
was through he was mine i knew it it
was like working with a child and when i
finished he offered to go with me to the
hole-in-the-wall any time within a week
-thats the limit for larry you know-
hell be ready to go when i call him can
you beat that

  within a week repeated masters
 martha you are divine within a week
to-morrow then-to-morrow

   when you talk like that louis she
cried starting up and facing him  you
send a chill down my back now listen to
me if we go another inch ahead with this
thing youve got to change your terms
ill lead axson to you-right into the
hole-in-the-wall but once hes there youve
got to stay inside the limit

   are you welching on me snarled
masters and he drew back a little  did
you fall in love with his damned ugly
face

   you can do what you like to him she
said  but after youre through hes got to
be alive-and in shape to come back to
his old self

  there was a pause during which their
eyes fought

    is that final he asked in a low voice
at length

    absolutely

   she went oihastily  louis hes doing
this out of pity for me think of it-
pity the poor fool

  the fool rejoined masters very
well you have it your own way get him
to the hole-in-the-wall and ill stay in-
side my limit

   thats straight she asked suspi-
ciously
the frigate bird



   it is

   louis she murmured  are you very
angry with me

  he seemed to gather himself for an effort
then he caught her into his arms with a
laugh

   angrv im more in love with you
martha than ive ever been

   and how much is that she cried
 oh louis masters you yellow-eyed devil
how much can i believe you

  she broke away flushed-with dancing
eyes

   theres more business left she said

	well finish that first

   good muttered masters with a sigh
that may have been relief  what is it
 wtio do i work with in the hole-in-the-
wall

   theres onlv one man  trust thats
billy clune

   that ugly devil-one-eyed clune

   that same ugly devil 

   but when hes not full of dope hes as
tricky as they make them

   hes tricky in some things said mas-
ters  but  can trust him for this because
martha when i tell him what i intend to
do billy would rstther be there to help than
any place else in the world

   and what will you do she said with
a shudder

   the finer points my dear said the
master criminal smiling  you must leave
to your imagination when im through
with him hell still be-alive

  she clapped a hand across her eyes as if
she were shutting out the thought

   very well then ill work with clune
but will he listen to me
ki ill see him first and whisper my plan
in his ear then hell be willing to go to
hell to pushf it through  tell you martha
that sallow-faced demon lives for the sake
of giving pain

   hes as ugly as axson nodded the girl
u but axson is a clean ugly clune ft the
kind of ugly that-well he makes me think
of a poisonous spider with his long crooked
legs and his greasy skin and deaths-head
 in a way said asters  i suppose he
is the vilest of the vile-the lowest of
the low but he has his uses youve no

idea how much the three x has used th
old reprobate

  a record for pride she said sarcas-
tically

   a record of necessity answered mas-
ters

   whats his past

   i dont know no one knows hes
one of those men who seem to have been
born to crime and who are raised to it
its in his blood he naturally does the
crooked thing he lives by hate he is
a spider martha he lives on life-blood
 understand that in the old-days he used
to be a common dip but that was long ago
his hand grew too unsteady

  they say that he was once a common
moll-buzzer but as years went on he had
to give that up he took to worse crimes
now there isnt a capital crime on the
calendar ill wager that billy clune hasnt
been guilty of

   wtiats his real name

   i dont think even god knows that if
he does you can rest assured that hes
ashamed of the knowledge but after all
billy is the man for me if he doesnt
suit you tell me so and ill find another
in the meantime ill send for billy and
after im through with him you can see
him in the hole-in-the-wall

victory

it was two days later that windsor dashed
into the room of axson late in the morn-
ing the somber giant had been out late
the night before and in a direction of which
he would not as usual say the slightest
word to windsor wtiatever his adventure
however it left him stolid grim and phleg-
matic he had been sitting passively be-
fore the window all morning staring out at
the sky twice before windsor had striven
to rouse him each time he had signally
failed but now he came with a fresh de-
termination and actually shook the shoulder
of the colossus

   the telephone cried windsor she
has justelephoned shes read the letter
-my letter-your letter-our letter she


all-story weekly

got it yesterday she wants me to come to
see her victory axson damn it wake
up

   i wish you happiness said the other
mechanically and returned to his endless
examination of the pale blue sky

  but windsor would not have his spirits
dashed he left the room singing with an
idle farewell to axson dressed with happy
speed and started at once for the long
island house of dorn

  it was one of those hazy lazy days
warm with just enough stir to the wind to
make one conscious of the presence of the
air a faint mist lay streaked at random
along the hillsides the macadam flashed
and glittered as the automobile sped up the
winding roads there was a sense every-
where of the growing grass-of green living
things as they swept into the more open
district cattle browsed here and there
cows swung up their heads and looked
lazily at the whirring machine at the toot
of its horn a colt kicked up its heels and
raced wantonly over a hill and disappeared
on the farther side with tossing tail

  every breath was a breath of content-
ment excitement for windsor and yet the
road the air the hillsides were not half as
real to him as the memory of her voice over
the telephone if she had written in reply
to his note it would have been triumph
enough but for her to telephone-it wras
more than succcess-it was conquest it
flashed to his mind how much he owed to
the man who had written his letter for him
and the picture of that stolid figure at the
window recurred to him but only for an
instant he dismissed the thought of axson
as we all are apt to dismiss the thoughts
which puzzle us

  but beautiful as the day was it seemed
suddenly exalted to a higher atmosphere
when the machine whirred smoothly through
the gate of the house of dorn and wound
up the long road here the sea tempered
the air with coolness and added a subtle and
keen stimulus of salt one breath of that
changed air suggested the openness of ocean
voyages the prospects of foreign cities ad-
venture hope life

  was it a wonder that the heart  james
gordon windsor sang within him when he

waited in the reception-room for the coming
of elizabeth dorn

   coming she paused an instant at the door
of the big apartment to locate him and
then she came with outstretched hand
he had a sensation of brightness coming to-
ward him of solid light if there were such
a thing he could not find the thing that
was changed about her certainly it was
not that her face was altered though she
had grown suddenly a thousandfold more
beautiful it was like the change from
the statue to life her smile had a mean-
ing now that made him dizzy her eyes
seemed to be opened-wide-admitting him
it was like the change from the bud to the
flower a few days before that beauty had
been hulled in green now the full blossom
flared out before him the perfume went
through his blood like wine

  he had risen in that daze he took her
hand she spoke he answered he hardly
knew what either of them said then they
were sitting down she was facing him
still with that faint half smile of happiness
and welcome and the sense of change was
tremendous now it seemed not like eliza-
beth dorn the body was the same the
spirit was the spirit of a stranger

   ive done a bold thing-telephoning to
you she was saying  you dont think
the less of me for it

  he murmured something his senses were
only gradually clearing

    im sure you dont she smiled  be-
cause you were bold yourself i have fin
ished reading your letter again for the twen-
tieth time im perfectly frank about it
you see it seems to me a very wonderful
letter it made clear to me that-accident
-in the garden which weve agreed to for-
get

   forget he echoed

    after your letter thats hardly possi-
ble is it then ill be franker still your
letter made it seem more possible explained
it will you let me tell you just why i have
sent for you

    will it trouble you

   not in the least i want to

   her eyes were so clear so frank so curi-
ous upon him that he was disturbed some-
thing had shaken her indeed but had not
the frigate bird



carried her off her feet there was a great
deal of- hard work still lying before him
he saw that

   first id like to try to explain some-
thing about myself-something about all
girls i suppose or do you already knpw
a great deal about them

   i feel said windsor earnestly  as if
 knew nothing

  she laughed softly

   this is the thing id like to explain
its very intimate but weve started on such
an intimate footing that i suppose we may
as well keep on dont jou think

 we really can hardly avoid it can we
 i think not the thing  want to ex-
plain is this we all have the feeling that it
is possible to meet-merely look at a person
-and then care a great deal

  surely it is possible

   but you see she explained  so many
men take that possibility for granted that a
girl has to be on her guard she hardly ever
dares to be even really friendly with a man
until she has known him-oh a very great
length of time do you understand

   i know there are men like that he
said  i wont pretend that  dont

  she studied him with a rather quizzical
smile which died away and left her deadly
earnest

   there are so many of them ishe said
 that ive always felt that there is tw man
who hasnt played at caring for some
woman in his life it was a rather horrible
thing to feel you know it took so much
of the glamour from all life are you smil-
ing at me 

   i am listening-reverently  he said

   and that night in the garden-i
couldnt help but feel that you were like all
the rest just playing and hoping against
hope that i would take you in earnest 

   but now

   but after your letter-that wild and
beautiful letter i was no longer so sure
i tried to think it over calmly and make
up rnv mind but every time i read the
letter it was impossible for me to think i
found myself taking your place and stand-
ing at your side yet still there was a
ghost of doubt it didnt seem possible
 but finally you knew

  i did but it was not from the letter
 that i got the knowledge

  wtas it another man asked windsor
 in a hard voice and he stared fixedly at her
 it was

 he whitened and sat stiff in his chair

  i should like very much to know him
 said james windsor

 she smiled again

  there would be trouble if you met i
 gather from the way you say that and
 yet i also wish that you could meet him
 -as i met him

  will you tell me his name

  i wish that i could

  you wish he echoed

  doesnt it seem impossible that i could
 learn so much from a man and then not
 know his name

  tell me only-well how well do you
 know him

  i have met him twice

 good heavens

  ive met you not many more times
 he was silent then  will you de-
 scribe him

  i have never seen his face

 he could only stare

  but ill tell you all i can about him
 because in a strange way he made it seem
 possible for me to believe in you

        chapter xxix 

the awakening

   t was only a few nights ago that i
 first met him she went on  youll
 remember the night it was the eve-
 ning when mr masters came to the house
 and did that-strange thing i ran out i
 couldnt stay inside and face people you
 know

 k  i went out hating all men i think
 they all seemed treacherous and mysteri-
 ous and i started into the big arbor at the
 side of the house where i could be alone
 and think things over-or stop thinking of
 anything at all

 it was pitchy black in the arbor that
 night so that i couldnt see what was there
 but something was there it was a man i
 wont tell you how we started talking o-

 gether he confessed at once that he was
 a fugitive-from the law i think of
 course i started back for the house in a
 good deal of alarm at that but something
 about him held me there it was like a
 hand at my shoulder turning me back so
 i stayed and i talked with him

   i couldnt see him-only a vague out-
line but i jelt him in an odd way through
the darkness do you guess what i mean

  he talked like an educated man he
seemed to think like a man of culture but
he was a criminal he told me so

   and he whined to you for sympathy
asked windsor

   whined there was nothing sneaking
or mean about him he had been born
into the criminal world i gathered from
what he said it was inescapable for him
 an old old story remarked windsor
 perhaps but he didnt tell it in an old
way he didnt ask for sympathy or ad-
vice or help he simply seemed to be over-
whelmed with gloom-sorrow do you
know that as he talked i began to feel a
tremendous sense of insignificance a mo-
ment before i had thought myself most mis-
erable - the most wretched person under
the sky but hearing him i decided-well
that i hadnt the capacity to feel real mis-
ery i felt all at once that no woman can
suffer in the mind as a man can suffer do
you see

   i suppose said windsor coldly  that
the fellow had had long practice in rehears-
ing his yarn

   i wish you wouldnt say that she an-
swered with a touch of irritation  its
possible that he was bluffing and that i am
easily deceived its barely possible but
if you had heard that deep strong voice
as i heard it im sure it would have con-
vinced you think of a man without
friends-without hope-followed by a sort
of curse which had stayed with him since
his birth

   very byronic said windsor easily
 but what was his object in talking with
you if he had no requests to make

   a strange object it seemed to make
him happy merely to have me there and i
was deeply complimented to know that i
could make such a man-even a thief-

happy it stirred me terribly and in a
way which i cant explain finally before
i went in he promised that he might come
again always by the night and whistle a
signal which would bring me down

   and when i went back into the house
i was happy i could lift up my head and
talk to people freely for after i had
talked with him it seemed to me a silly
thing to be ashamed for as little cause as i
had

   i remember what you talked of to me
that night said windsor thoughtfully
 you talked of criminology you talked
of heredity in crime i thought it odd at
the moment that you should be interested
in such a subject

   and im still interested

   i knew said windsor smiling  that
your hero would win you over to his suffer-
ings before long have you decided yet to
help him to a new start in life

  she regarded him with a sort of cold
judging disappointment

   you think he lurked there in wait for
me that night

   theres hardly a reasonable doubt of
that is there he replied good-naturedly

   why should i be angry because you
dont understand she murmured  it
sounds so like a cock-and-bull story that
im inclined to doubt now and then that it
ever really happened and you may be
sure that you are the first and only person
who has heard it

   i take that as a compliment he said
 i mean it as a very sincere one she
answered

   and your nocturnal visitor hasnt yet
asked for money

   he is really not after money at all

   well

   he came for me

  windsor looked at her with starting eyes
 i admit that it sounds wild she said
with a faint smile  and that is where he
links up with your letter you see i
wanted to believe your letter i wanted
to believe that men were capable of such
fine and impulsive outbreaks but i simply
couldnt but last night my nameless
friend came again

   ah
the frigate bird



   now youre excited

   ive reason to be he came again

   yes and he did the thing you think he
could not have been bold enough to do

   he actually cried windsor  he actu-
ally had the effrontery to-to make love to
you

  he did not sentimental nonsense
but a wild strong free outburst it swept
me off my feet literally it dazed me
he seemed to be bringing the stars about
my head

   then i gathered that he was saying
good-by he wanted to tell me what i
meant to him and then he was leaving me
forever he would accept no help he
would leave no trace he simply came with
a storm of the wildest-the most strange
and barbarous-beautiful eloquence-and
then he walked away into the night

  she was afire in talking and windsor
mutely watching her knew what had awak-
ened her from childhood to womanhood
within those few days  it w-as the man
of the night

  she went on  then with his words still
going back and forth like fire through me
i went up to my room and picked up your
letter for the twentieth time it no longer
seemed wild or strained it seemed the
frankest and the most beautiful truth
and i saw at once that it was possible for
a man to feel suddenly and deeply and
lastingly not like the men i have known
all my life-not like such men-pardon me
-as you seemed to me before i read this
letter-but like something more real closer
to the soil fuller of native strength

   do i make all this very vague and
childish in your ears

   i see now he said  but where does
it lead -

   i will tell you where i hope it shall
lead she answered  i hope it will lead
to affine strong friendship im going to
do an unusual and rash thing im going
to ask you to come here often

   do you call that rashness

   you dont understand im asking you
to come and try to show me what you really
are you see i know from your letter
and from the words of that man in the
night that it is possible for men to be

lighted with fire inside i want to find the
source of that fire i want to understand
your strength will you understand when
i say that so far you have held up an im-
penetrable shield before me it was only
in that letter that you lowered the shield
perhaps the man for whom diogenes
hunted would have admitted then that
he had not written the letter but all mor-
tals are weak and windsor was extremely
mortal he could not confess not while
she sat so close to him with such a peculiar
charm about her she was like the spring
winds heavy with perfumes at least
windsor was man enough to feel a deep
pity for the visitor of the night his
thought passed automatically from this
stranger to the man who had written the
letter-the connection which the two had in
the mind of the girl

  then a strange surmise caught at him

  he said with a sudden new interest
will you describe this stranger of yours
 i told you i had never seen his face
 but his voice

   are you interested even in that

   i think you said there was something
unusual about it

   you are excited she queried

   because i think he answered  that i
know the man to whom you refer and if
i do-if he is the man who has come to you
those two times then he is the most dam-
nable the most subtle and dangerous devil
who ever walked in the form of a man
tell me about his voice

  she was startled by his direct command
but she answered mechanically a very
deep strong voice

   not loud suggested windsor  but
with a peculiar soft vibrancy about it-a
carrying quality-a voice which makes one
think that it has not been used a great deal
-the voice of a generally silent man
you have exactly hit upon it she
cried  you do know him

  and her face lighted that of windsor
darkened correspondingly

   i think i do-too well but ill make
sure of him tell me was there anything
remarkable about his size

   only his largeness he was very tall
as tall as you i think


all-story weekly

   it is he muttered windsor

  he rose

   why do you speak like that she
asked rising with him and then her glance
going up to his face  mr windsor what
is it that you intend to do

   justice said the big man  if its in
my power im going to see thatjustice is
done

  she cried as he turned away  no no
you mustnt go like this for the sakes of
both of you-for your sake most of all
mr windsor i know that man is dangerous
if you cross him in a humor like this 

  if its the last act of my life said
windsor he shall be crossed to-day 
and he strode from the room without a
farewell

chapter xxx

the hole-in-the-wall

it was earlier that day before the message
from elizabeth dorn reached windsor
and martha perce was walking through
a crowded district on the east side-the
lower east side where the unwashed chil-
dren swarm across the streets from gutter
to gutter where the traffic literally ploughs
its way through a mass of humanity where
human life seems cheap where man seems
closest to the animal

 through that swarm martha perce
picked her way gaily blithely she was
walking by choice for she saw the day as
the greatest in her life her plans with
masters were complete with this great
event finished with axson hopelessly in the
power of her lover she ind masters were to
leave america and pass abroad for a long
long vacation they were to spend the
summer in the scottish highlands the au-
tumn in paws the winter in sicily

  as a matter of fact her mind was fuller
of the dresses she should buy in paris and
wear through italy than it was of the un-
scrubbed boys who brushed against her
skirt and she walked with an indescrib-
able buoyancy like a leaf carried lightly
along by the wind it was one of those foul
and narrowralleys where the shadow in sum-
mer seems a black blanket of stifling heat

and in winter a breath of ice yet in this
place martha was too much at home to look
about her in curiosity she held straight on
until she reached the door of a second-hand
clothes shop it was a basement shop the
entrance being a flight of perilously steep
stairs its rais were crowded with a host
of worn garments tagged with the prices
in gigantic letters

  from the mysterious shadows of this
shop however rose a shrill jangle of voices
a mighty pleading that would have been
worthy of the cause of a falling empire

   two thirty-two two thirty-two for
that rag

   rag rag call you it gott rm him-
melt geltebier gott dot elegant coat -
a rag

  and a nasal whine replied  listen bo i
know you got a kind heart i can see it in
your map two bucks is all i got honest
to gawd here-you let me take the coat
-you lake the two bucks-we call it
square 

   back zuriickkomme i have a vife
i have two kinder do i take the brot out
of their mouths do they go barefoot so
that a schwern like you shall go in fine
clothes vot

  and martha perce walking through the
shop saw to the right the proprietor a
german jew with a forehead and a chin
so narrow and retreating and a nose so
gigantic that his face seemed only one fea-
ture she slipped down a narrow avenue
crowded with ragged clothes for the pride
of his stock was exposed to the public gaze
near the pavement his little beady eyes
darting through the mazes of iris stock fixed
on her she made a sign with rapid fingers
and he nodded to her an imperceptible
acquiescence which in no wise interrupted
the steady storm of his argument before
she disappeared however it was plain that
the sight of the two dollars was takings-the
heart from his eloquence	s

  she continued straight to the back of the
little store and through a filthy little room
which apparently served as the living place
of the jew a closet filled one corner of
the room she opened the door of this
pressed through a mass of clothes and fum-
bled against the boards behind
the frigate bird



  at length she reached a button that yield-
ed under her touch-the wall opened-and
martha stepped through pressing the door
to behind her it was very massively made
that door two heavy slabs of solid wood
-single sheets-contained a thick padding
of sawdust the door was almost sound-
proof

  the passage into which the door opened
was hardly larger than the door itself and
led down a steep pitch of steps it was
utterly dark in the passage and the steps
were correspondingly invisible but martha
descended with the confidence of long famil-
iarity at the foot of the stairs a second
wall blocked her progress she tapped
against it interspersing the raps with little
spaces like a telegrapher a section of it
gave way at once and swung very slowly
back the opening not more than an inch
in width through this a sharp ray of
light darted out like a pointing finger of
white against her

   its martha she said stepping into
the ray of light

  the door instantly stood wide and re-
vealed a man with an unhooded dark lan-
tern beside it

   evening he said  hows things out-
side

   all right she answered stepping
through  but its morning not evening
he raised the lantern so that the light
shone more directly into her face from
the shadow in which this threw him she felt
his eyes burn into hers

   listen he whispered  you got the
dope i know that when am i goin to
be clear of all this

   lie low jimmy she answered calmly
 the dicks are still buzzing about youll
come out when you have a chance to make
your getaway you can trust to that 

   i been a whole month down here in
hell he returned despondently closing the
ponderous door  its about time some-
thing turned up they aint keepin me
a-purpose because they cant land another
for this job

   if they didnt trust you dyou think
theyd put you on a door she said con-
temptuously  use the old bean once in
a while jimmy

   lay off on the panning he growled in
answer  i guess im o k here all right
 you sure are wheres clune

   on the hop said the other  i guess
hes hitting the pipe

   if he is hell catch hell hes supposed
to be on the job to-day where  i find
him

   get lu chi he knows about clune
most generally

  so martha perce turned and went on
down the passage it was full of winding
and branchings here and there it would
have confused any one but him who kept
a map of the place in his mind once or
twice figures passed her in the narrow pas-
sage flattening against the wall and sidling
till they were by and each one kept his
face scrupulously toward her each one
was catlike on the alert

  so she reached at length a little square
room with a roof so low that she could
not stand erect entering she stood bowed
and looked down into the wrinkled face of a
chinaman who sat cross-legged on a mat at
one side of the room on shelves on the
wall beside him were ranged alcohol lamps
pipes and little tin cans before him stood
a delicate balance scales the eye of the
girl surveyed the ugly face of the opium-
seller with a calm interest

   hows business lu she asked

  the round bald head rolled forward on
the thick and scraggy neck

   good said lu chi

  his dim old eyes wandered from her
to his assortment of opium utensils on the
shelves beside him

   no said the girl shaking her head
in disgust  im not on the hop yet lu
but wheres clune

  his vacant eye looked sadly past her
he shook his head

  you old fool said the girl angrily
 im not going to take him away from you
for good besides its orders from the big
chief-masters wheres clune

  lu chi grinned feebly

   catchum pretty quick two door down
tliat way

  she favored him with another lingering
glance of contempt and then made her way
in the direction he had indicated


all-story weekly

  the air was close and savored of under-
ground uncleanness-a prison odor but
when she opened the appointed door her
flesh crawled

  the room was so dimly lighted that at
first she made out nothing then by de-
grees her eyes found beneath the flicker
of the oil-lamp a three-legged stool with a
tattered magazine upon it and rimmed
about with the stubs of half-smoked cigar-
ettes the sleeper on wakening merely
had to reach out his hand and his smoke
was ready prepared a few garments hung
on nails against the wall the bed itself
was a bunk modeled after the fashion of
the berth on a ship and on it lay a con-
fused bundle of rags through the fetid
atmosphere of the place and by the ghastly
light of that lamp there was a suggestion
of death it was exaggerated in the prone
figure which lay with the stained blanket
wrapped around its head and when
martha perce reached out her hand she was
prepared to feel under the dirty shirt of the
man the firm cold flesh of death

chapter xxxi

clune

the bony shoulder of the sleeper how-
ever had hardly felt her touch when
he twisted and slipped to his feet
breathing hard crouched ready like a
hunted rat to dart in any direction of es-
cape by degrees however recognition
came into his eyes as he stared at her
finally he rose almost to an erect position
but his hand crept furtively around his
shoulder and rested on the spot where her
fingers had touched

  standing straight he was very tall
though of a skeleton leanness one shirt-
sleeve was rolled up to the elbow and the
wrist waslarger than any other exposed
part of the arm he seemed literally a
skeleton bound together with sinews and
no muscle thai angular frame was shaken
with a perpetual tremor all that remained
of what must once have been a mighty
physical power was a fitful nervous energy
the very light of his eyes went in and out
continually waxing to ominous brightness

and dying out to a soft glimmer buried
eyes with heavy lids pendulous red and
swollen-so large that they forever threat-
ened to drop and veil his sight his nose
was thin and high-hawklike but the
mouth beneath it was clothed and obscured
in an irregular mass of beard not the
beard that grows from intention but that
which springs from neglect unless it were
perhaps that this man wished to mask the
supernatural ugliness of his face if so
he failed of his purpose for the brush of
hair served to suggest in the extreme the
misshapen features beneath he seemed to
martha perce the ugliest man she had ever
seen-the ugliest human being yet he re-
minded her of some one-whom she could
not think

  it was not only the misshapen face but
there was a suggestion about it of mingled
cringing and tyranny of mixed cruelty and
cowardice it was as if a fire of malice
directed at the whole world had burned
away the flesh of the hideous deaths-head
and made him ready for the grave before
his time his age however was indefinite
he might have been fifty he might have
been ninety

  resolution returned gradually to this
shivering giant as he stood before the girl
clutching suspiciously at his shoulder

   who tipped you off he said venom-
ously  who gives you the high-sign to
touch on that shoulder eh

   and why not that shoulder

  l why because red bender knifed me
there but what dyou want spit it out 

   im martha perce masters has al- 
ready told you about me

  for an instant the eyes of the skeleton
were vague and troubled then they
flamed at once with evil joy

   ah drawled clune  youre the lass
that worked the plant oh ive heard of
you but they needed billy clune to put
on the fancy touches at the end eh

  he rubbed his fleshless hands together
they turned purple under the pressure-
rude splotches then he laughed it was
rather a convulsion shaking him from head
to foot and ending in a hard cough

   you nab him he continued  and i
put him in safe-keeping oh ill keep him
the frigate bird



safe well enough come and ill show
you where ill put him

   its well enough to talk of putting him
said the girl  but thats because you
havent seen him i tell you we may lead
him somewhere but well never put him
any place theres no doubt of that why
old skin-and-bones hed break you in two
with a look 

   would he exclaimed the deaths-head
and toe started back

  but instantly his calm returned though
as he spoke an ague fit shook his limbs

   hell never see me no not till hes
safe and sound down below come on
lass and ill show you his cage

   but will it be ready for him to-night
   its ready now come along

  he led her down a passage through a
door and down a long flight of steps this
in turn opened on a concrete passageway
that ended on a stout door this he
opened pressed a button and a small elec-
tric globe glowed in the top of the chamber
 look  said he

   a pretty place murmured martha
perce but are the walls strong

   concrete

   and the door

   look at it

  it was a full three inches thick

 let him be hercules grinned billy
clune  it  do him no good let him
bellow not a soul can hear him oh
it  be a game for poor old billy clune
 a game

   look here 

  he pointed to a massive iron shutter not
more than four inches square and opening
from the inside

   billy clune  stand here and when
he begs to get out-

   hell never beg in a thousand years
said the girl

   oh maybe hes brave but wait till the
darkness begins to eat in on him-like acid
i tell you i know i you begin to think of
the fine yellow sunlight you begin to be
sickest of all for the sound of a mans voice
the damned darkness turns a minute into a
year ive seen em come out of that hole
with white hair that was black when they
went in all that in a night

   aye hell holler for company right
enough and billy clune will be standin
here listening maybe hell open the shut-
ter and then hell see billy clunes face
close to his eh

  martha perce shuddered

   ay none of em like to look at me no
i aint pretty but hell look out and see
me and ill tell him how close he is to
hell

   what a devil you are murmured the
girl

   am i sneered billy clune  and
what are you my fine beauty what are
you

  he led the way back and up the stairs
to the main floor of the underground tun-
nels

   but maybe i can talk to him maybe
i can soothe him a bit if i knew more about
this cull gimme the dope on him lass

   you know enough she said  and
youve told me enough your part of the
work is planned ill do mine theres
no need for us to talk good-by

  he blocked her way

   but how can i talk polite to this bird
if i dont even know his name gimme his
name lass 

  she answered rather to get the creature
out of her way than because she wished him
to know  axson now stand away from
me

  the first word she spoke indeed effectu-
ally removed him from her path as if he
had been struck violently in the face he
sagged back against the wall his bony arms
outspread in all their length his spider-
hands gripping at the boards

  his strength came back with a surge just
as she stepped past him he clutched her
arm with such sudden and terrible strength
that the skinny fingers seemed about to
force their way through the flesh

   get your dirty hands away from me
said the girl sharply  ill have you milled
for this

   the name the name repeated the
monster 

   ive told you once what does it mean
to you get back or ill have you hided

  the grotesque pushed his face close to
hers
	all-story weekly

   tell me my dear my beauty he said
and his upper lip lifting in the snarl dis-
played a row of yellow wolf-fangs tell
me or ill wring that soft little neck for you
dye hear

she shrank back from this monstrous
demoniac in real alarm shecould bring
a dozen men to her aid with a single shout
perhaps but in that instant billy clune
might have fastened his grip in the hollow
of her throat she felt the strength of a
madman in the fingers that held her shoul-
der

   axson she said again

  as if she had touched him with fire a
scream came from the twisting lips of the
giant

  axson he repeated no no no

  and he shook her until her teeth rattled
in her head like castanets

   help screamed martha perce

  dull shouts rose instantly in answer

dope

tered billy clune and he flashed a
hunted glance up and down the pas-
sage  i tell you it mustnt be axson

fied by those wild and wandering eyes

  his fingers relaxed with a sigh but be-
fore she could slip away he seized her
again

and if you lie again ill-throttle you
 hes a big man stammered the girl
 as tall as you let me go billy

   as tall as me groaned the deaths-
head god

  the rescuers were already racing down
the tunnel close to them but before they
arrived a child could have handled billy
clune the moment of mad strength had

left him he sagged back drooping against
the wall

   whats up asked the man in the lead
as he halted panting  whats wrong
down here somebody holler

   only old billy clune mac said the
girl  theres something wrong with him
hes off his nut thought he was going
to choke me a minute back

   the old fool  answered the man ad-
dressed as mac  he is off his nut been
off for a year with the hop

 look at that murmured martha
billy clune straightened again and
stretched out his clawlike hands toward the
girl he seemed to be feeling his way to
her

   theres been a mistake martha perce
he said   tell you theres been a mis-
take send off these fellers lemme talk
to you alone 

   keep him away mac implored the
girl if he touches me again ill-i
knife him 

   keep back from her snarled mac

  so saying he smote the tall man on the
chest with the flat of his hand the force
of the blow sent him staggering back cough-
ing

   martha perce f he screamed in a par-
oxysm of eagerness and the harsh coughing

   will you listen to him asked mac
 the poor devil seems nutty about some-
thing 

   all right she said controlling herself
strongly  what is it

   go back to masters replied the
deaths-head  and tell him that hes got to
call off his bloodhounds 

   if youre crazy enough to think hell

self

 that the man he wants is my son

clune beating his bony breast at every
word  if johnny done wrong its because

-	foxy windsor - smooth -windsor - he
clone it-he made him crooked bring

the frigate bird



   whats all this bunk asked mac
scowling

   the poof devil  murmured the girl
white with pity and horror  masters is
out to get a bird that clune claims for his
son hes ugly enough to be clunes boy
mac youll-have to lock up billy the
chief will break everybody if this stunt with
axson goes wrong

   listen to me shrieked clune and he
clawed his way among the men toward her
 masters can have me he can have my
body and my blood go tell him that if
he lays a hand on johnny ill-

   shut up roared mac and he clapped
his hand with stunning force across the
jabbering mouth of the old man  shut
up your blood how much blood is
there in your old snakes body

  easy mac easy cautioned the girl
 dont bust him in two maybe hes
right

   aw its a pipe-dream said mac scorn-
fully  here boys pick up the old fool
and take him along

  he fell baok beside martha while his at-
tendants lifted the gaunt form of billy
clune and bore him on ahead screaming
and pleading every foot of the way

   what  you do with him mac she
asked  dont go too hard on him mas-
ters thinks hes pretty valuable you know
 i know nodded mac  im not go-
ing to use him bad but im going to
put him to sleep

   the dope

   yep

   maybe he wont take it

   him not take it

  mac laughed with the scorn of superior
knowledge

   hes been off the hop for two days
nearly getting ready for this job of mas-
terss i guess why when he sees the stuff
hell be like a hungry man smellin bacon
i know him 

   see you keep him safe warned the
girl  he knows axson is with windsor
and if he knows that he knows where to
reach him and if he gives him warning
i tell you masters will be down on us all
like a demon and you know what he is when
he starts wrong 

  dont i said mac shrugging hia
shoulders  aw ill keep this old wreck
still shoot him in through that door to
the left boys here one of you go tell
lu chi to bring some stuff on the run
it was a vacant room much like the one
in which she had first seen clune-a
wretched place the only air was that
which came through a small grating high up
on the wall

   this place isnt fit for a dog she said
 are you going to leave him here

   in ten minutes said mac coldly  hell
think that hes in heaven

   but is it safe doesnt that grating
open on a way to the street

   it does

  he tried the bars of the grating

   but old billy couldnt budge em he
hasnt the strength of a girl except when
hes batty with the dope or something like
that

  his messenger returned with alcohol-lamp
already lighted the telltale pipe and a little
can together with a long needle all this
time billy clune had kept up a shrill hys-
terical pleading when he saw the opium
outfit he began to curse horribly

   ill see you in hell before i touch the
stuff he shouted  martha gimme one
chance lemme say one word to you

   pat said mac  start cooking him
a pill will you

  accordingly the man who had brought
the outfit kneeled beside the alcohol-lamp
inserted the long needle in the little can
gathered a globule of the black contents on
the end and began to turn this slowly over
the flame

  nowr watch said mac and turned
with chuckle to the girl

  two men had been using their utmost
efforts to keep billy clune motionless on
the edge of the bunk now his struggles
gradually rejaxed

  under their bald vulture eyelids his eyes
fixed upon the flame of the alcohol-lamp
he raised a faltering bony hand and
brushed away the whiskers from before his
mouth then he began to curse softly
steadily but all the while his glance kept
steadily on the cooking of the  pill

   hell never smoke it said the girl

  the skeleton hand of billy clune was
slowly reaching out to pat

rattle of horrible eagerness through parted
lips

the blow

when windsor returned from the
house of dorn he found that ax-
son was out all afternoon he
waited for the grim-faced giant to return
he paced the rooms with the eagerness of
a starved wolf and watched the sunlight
strike through the window at a greater and
greter slant finally it assumed tints of
rose and gold and the sudden twilight set
in-the twilight of the city with the shadow
falling from vast skyscrapers many a min-
ute before the upper sky is dimmed

  then in the half-light the outer door
of the apartment opened at length and the
familiar heavy-light footstep went down the
jiall-weight and softness uncannily com-
bined in the living-room windsor inter-
cepted his man he said nothing he
merely stood straight with his arms at his
sides waiting but axson after a quick
glance at his host halted

   well he asked sharply after a mo-
ment of silence

   ive seen her said windsor in a se-
pulchral voice

  and his eye measured the colossus from
head to foot he had never seemed so

  large as in this moment yet there was
fighting blood in windsor it ran back for
many a generation and he was determined

   if youve had bad luck with her said
axson dryly  im sorry ive done what

i	could but ill have to hear the story
some other time	

   there is no tinje like the present an-
swered windsor retaining his calm with a
great effort

   very well said axson

   sit down

  but the colossus leaned one great hand
on the back of a chair and waited silently

  windsor in turn locked each of the doors
then he came back and faced his guest

   i have seen her he repeated  and
she has told me everything

   within two hours said axson  i
have an important engagement im afraid

i	cant wait to hear it all

   youre very mistaken answered
windsor  you will wait until im com-
pletely through besides what i have to
say will not take long

   good said axson  but stand back
a little from me youre excited and be-
ing so near may prompt you to do some
rash thing 

   impossible said windsor  i am the
soul of patience in fact i dare not let
myself think of all that is on my mind
axson im going to tell you a story

  not a flash of apprehension lightened the
eyes of axson he seemed to be studying
his host impersonally as one might study
a masterpiece in oil painting something
which reveals itself more every instant

   on second thought went on windsor
growing white and stiff about the lips
 im going to tell you only the summary
of a story my nerves wont stand the
whole thing axson what would you think
of a fellow who buys his way into the con-
fidence of another mai worms himself into
another mans heart under pretense of
friendship and then knifes him in the
back

   i am not in the habit of making com-
ments said axson

   but even you wjll have to make some
remark on this consider a man who is so
close to another that he can even advise
the frigate bird



him in his affairs of the heart and then
uses his intimate knowledge to undo his
friend isnt that act like one who puts
before a hungry man food with poison in
it answer me

  but axson said not a word

  listen said windsor quivering in
every muscle of his big body   tell you
i have talked with her and she has told me
everything does that mean anything to
you

   nothing 

   nothing nothing that you have met
her in the night made love to her tangled
her into a cunning web of romance noth-
ing that you so worded the letter you wrote
for me that you won her for yourself under
pretense of winning her for me is all
that nothing

   won her said axson and his face
contorted with a terrible swift pain  did
you say won her windsor

  his voice was not much louder than a
whisper but the hollow murmur of it filled
the room from wall to wall and in the little
bitter silence which followed a faint echo
seemed to repeat the question

    said it youve won her damn you
no she may not fully understand as yet
just how much shes won but she is weak-
ened roused on fire shes trembling to
the fall shes in love

  in love with a voice in the night
queried axson

  there was something so bitter and so
eager at once in his manner that windsor
drew back and regarded his companion with
a mixture of wonder and hatred

   is it possible he murmured  that
you did not know what you were doing all
this time no it is not possible

   windsor said the giant  she does
not know my name

   what is a name

   is it so little as that cried axson
and a flush swept up his face

  it died out at once and left him gray
leaden

  he added in a choked murmur she
has never seen my face

   do you dare to deny cried windsor
 that you have been playing a cold-heart-
ed game with her

   	a-s

   game repeated axson vaguely

   what axson in the name of heaven
do you love this pure beautiful girl

  and the giant answered with uplifted
face quietly with all my heart

  after a time windsor said softly  then
you are an unspeakable cur

  the colossus did not move

   do you hear

  and in a rising voice  an unspeakable
cur

  and yet axson still betrayed no sign of
hearing

   then said windsor  ill do the last
thing

  and stepping a long pace closer he drew
back his aim and smote his open palm
with all his strength ujion the mouth of
axson

  instantly thereafter like a man who
has dropped a high-power explosive he
leaped back to the further side of the room
crouching ready to fight for his life in a
desperate hopeless battle

  but by the dim twilight he saw axson
still unmoved his hand still resting on the
back of the chair the imprint of white
fingers was across his mouth a drop of
blood gathered slowly and then trickled
down the chin of the giant leaving a little
trace of red

  yet that silence that movelessness
meant more to windsor than the bellowing
of cannon the two dark eyes fixed upon
him were like the round black muzzles of
two rifles pointing a message toward his
heart the sweat of nameless terror glis-
tened on the forehead of windsor he be-
gan to wonder why that large hand did not
rise and wipe away the trace of blood
then he felt that the first movement of the
giant would be to spring at him a catapult-
ing mass of bone and muscle herculean in
strength catlike in activity

  he had thought it all out coolly before
he had one chance in ten to beat down the
monster whose strength he had felt those
days before in a single blow he was will-
ing to take that one chance but now
that he faced the impending danger he
knew that he had been a fool there was
not one chance in ten there was not a
chance in a million it was death that


all-story weekly

 looked out at him from those two inhu-
 manly steady eyes he had as much
 chance as an unarmed man pitted against
 the might of a tiger and the cunning of a
 human brain

    in fancy he felt the grip of that large
  hand on his throat tightening slowly with
  the power of hot steel shrinking into place

 he felt the finger tips crunch through his
muscle he felt them close against the bone

    the lower jawr of windsor sagged he
 began panting heavily with a harsh rattle
 distinctly audible throughout the room
 he could no longer look the monster in the
 face but his eyes wandered swiftly from
 door to door was there a ghost of a
 chance that he might leap to one of those
 doors turn the key and escape no he
 could hear in fancy the mocking laugh of
 the giant as he dragged back his prey into
 the room

   too late to think now the giant
 moved he drew forth a handkerchief
 brushed the stain from his mouth turned
 slowly and with unhurried step walked
 from the room windsor saw but did not
 comprehend blackness and flashes of fire
 darted across his eyes as he watched the
 door close and then he knew that he was
 saved strength went from him he
 slipped down into a senseless heap against
 the wall

chapter xxxtv

the waiting

 when he recovered from that ner-
 vous collapse physically his mind
 was still a dazed blank there
 hung over him a sense like the impending
 danger of the nightmare-the pursuer
 about to reach him the stifling weight
 about to fall and the sphinx-face of ax-
 son unsmiling yet smiling always - in-
 credibly ugly incredibly terrible

    he felt certain that he had escaped for
  the moment merely because a sudden death
  would not suit axson even now perhaps
  he was devising some horrible plan of re-
  venge he knew perfectly that to this
  man death was an accident a trifling
  everyday matter

  so he sat with his head in his hands im-
agining horrors for the future moments
fled it was pitch dark bacon came at
length with word that dinner was waiting
to be served

  he called for coffee and brandy

  and he had it served to him in the black
room and sipping cup after cup and pony
after pony the one burned his throat
the other electrified his mind

  finally to escape from the terrific dark-
ness he switched on the lights but sud-
denly he remembered that lights within
would only serve as eyes to one watching
from without perhaps even at that in-
stant the swarthy giant crouched catlike
at the window peering in devising schemes
of ruin

  windsor nearly fainting switched off
the light again and staggered to his chair
finally the full knowledge reached him
that axson would return to him this night
first there was an impulse to lock the
doors to call in friends to start a wild
revel but he dismissed this thought at
once what were locks to axson what
were numbers and how terrible to fall
in the midst of happiness with laughing
friends about him wine bright in the light
and then the sudden blow oblivion for
him

  at least he would be prepared to make a
last stand he started to leave the room
but sat down again almost at once doors
were things of terror what might they not
open upon he pressed a button beneath
the table on which he leaned the door
opened-a mere black place on the black
wall he heard the voice of bacon speak-
ing through the night

   go to my room said windsor in a
dull mechanical voice  open the steam-
er trunk in the large closet take the au-
tomatic from the upper tray make sure
that it is loaded and bring it to me

  in due time the door opened again the
heavy butt of the gun snuggled against his
palm

  it brought an instant thrill of courage-
almost happiness but only an instant
he began to see more clearly that axson
would never walk back calmly before him
and face an automatic with its seven
the frigate bird



winged messengers of death no he would
kill from behind suddenly safely

  or what if he did stride suddenly into
the room could windsor hit a mark
with even an automatic and its seven fol-
lowing shots

  he raised his hand with the gun in it

  it wabbled crazily from side to side

  and windsor dropped his head upon his
hands and sobbed harshly hysterically

  now hot shame swept over him when
he heard his own sobs he straightened
in his chair with a jerk he remembered
scenes in college he remembered how he
had crashed through the line on the foot-
ball field a plunging fullback they had
called him  terrible  jimmy windsor in
those days many an old press-clipping
flashed back before his eyes crises in
games-a few yards to the goal-and then
terrible jimmy windsor had crashed like
a cannon-ball through the line he re-
membered days of exaltation one night
before an important game half the youths
of the college had gathered beneath his
window he heard the roar of hundreds
of voices  heres to jimmy windsor
drink her down drink her down

  other scenes the polo field the flare
of color from the stands faces of women
and excited men the thunder of hoofs
the whizz and cracks of the hammers
the darting of the ball the catapulting
flown the field into seemingly inextricable
masses of horse-flesh and always his
name living in the air from the spectators

  other scenes hunting once more he
was in the african jungle once more the
tall grass parted silently before him as if
a hand were brushing it aside once more
a tawny head thrust through the opening
lightnings came in the vast yellow eyes
the jaws snarled open the head low-
ered a yellow body flashed through the
air his heavy gun roared and the lion
lay kicking at his feet

  in all those places jimmy windsor had
never been afraid but was he not a cring-
ing coward now it was different even
the lion was a creature of flesh and blood
he had the feeling that the body of axson
was as immortal as the granite of the
sphinx which his hideous face suggested

  then he thought of approaching axson
gently with flattering words nonsense
he might as well speak to a stone image
had he not drawn the blood of the man
his fingers still in fancy tingled with that
stroke he saw again the little drop of
blood form on those whitened lips and steal
downward he could have spent half the
blood in his whole body to recall that sin-
gle drop

  but what was this the outer door was
opening a stride was coming down the
hall heavy and yet soft-an uncanny
lightness

  all the blood rushed from the heart of
windsor to his brain and back again he
pushed back his chair and dropped to his
knees behind the table then recogniz-
ing the uselessness of that childish deceit
he resumed his place at the table he
swept a book before him it was thick
he could rest the barrel of the gun upon
that to steady his shot

  now there was the click of the turning
door-knob and windsor curled his fore-
finger around the trigger the door swung
slowly wide and then windsor knew that
he had not the strength to fire the shot

  at the door stood axson his hand still
upon the knob he stood erect his head
far back with a sort of roman sternness
in his whole attitude

  he said  i have seen the girl again

  why did he not start and shrink back
when he saw the gun perhaps it was be-
cause he could not make it out in the dark-
ness and yet windsor felt with a sudden
horror that the big man in the door was in-
viting the shot axson himself was white-
ly illumined by the shaft of light down the
hall

   i have seen the girl again he repeat-
ed  but i did not speak to her

  he paused something that might have
been a smile twisted his lips

   it was not necessary to speak i stood
with my hat off where she could sec my
face do you understand windsor
when she saw my face she cried out and
turned away now i suppose she is wait-
ing for you to come to her

  life warmth flooded the brain of wind-
sor he sprang to his feet

  axson he cried

  well

  in the name of god have you really
 done this

  i have an important engagement
 said axson   am already overdue for it
 good night

 no no shouted windsor and rush-
 ing around the table he ran at the giant

 yet before he reached that goal some-
 thing stopped him short it was the ting-
 ling of the lingers of his right hand

  youve got to stay a moment he
 stammered

  why

  youve got to explain-

  i explain nothing more

  then youve got to hear me tell you
 why-how-i thought-

  but you have changed your mind

  axson you bear me no ill-will

  none

  theres no grudge between us

  nothing it was fate

  then youll come back to-morrow
 and-

  i think not

  what do you mean

  i think i shall not comc back from
 this appointment

  in the name of god axson what are
 you going to do

  nothing everything tt is only a
 premonition good night

 he closed the door

 windsor snatched it open but looking
 down the hall he saw the resolute broad
 back and shoulders of axson and knew the
 man could never be called back

chapter xxxv

the shutting of the door

 at the appointed corner axson met
 v martha perce she made a picture
 even more dejected than the one
 he had seen in his room on that mem-
 orable night she wore a shapeless gray
 overcoat with a narrow collar-a round-
 topped straw hat-wisps of hair straggled
 down from beneath the brim of the hat
 her face was colorless the shadows were

doubly deep around her eyes the eyes
themselves blazed with a restless light that
flickered dim and bright when she saw the
bulky form of axson

   im three minutes late said axson
 sorry i could not come sooner

   three minutes three years she
snarled and then clung to his arm as if she
feared to have offended him

   you aint mad at me

  he brushed her off

   take me to the place he said

   this way-straight ahead mr ax-
son no matter what comes of this  want
you to know-

   be silent he ordered curtly  say
nothing except what is absolutely neces-
sary well make better progress that
way

  she flashed a glance up at him from be-
neath the brim of her hat and then they
went on without another word

  it was a far different street from the one
she had walked down that morning then
the children had made two-thirds of the
crowd now since the night was not warm
enough to drive the youngsters out the
street was thronged with grown people
alone the noise was not so loud it was
rather a steady undertone with a touch of
the ominous about it now and then the
laughter of some woman cut through that
steady hum of voices otherwise the sound
flowed on like a river it had a hypnotiz-
ing effect

  they approached the alley in which the
shop of the second-hand clothes dealer
stood

  listen said the girl this is im-
portant were going into the hole-in-the-
wall through that shop straight ahead-
the one with the old jew standing out in
front hes in on the game with the triple
x yep hes a wise old bird and he gets
a fat rake-down hes rich from it and
the second-hand clothes game is only a
fence for him he doesnt know you and
he may get leery but ill tip him off
that youre a friend of mine and i think
well get by him o k understand but
if anything goes wrong we wont take the
chance get me i figure the way to get
by the entrance is plain bluff what
the frigate bird



   ill follow you said axson  but
how can you get by the guards with a
stranger

   sure i thought of that right off the
bat i think it  be a cinch they know
i want to get my pal out but theyll never
figure i got the crust to try a plant like
this theyll figure im simply leading in
a new guy thats o k they know- me
ill tip em off that youre o k and it 
work fine you wait and see

  he shrugged his shoulders and followed
the girl as she turned in at the door of the
jews shop he flashed a glance at them

  if a new pal of mine whispered the girl
in a voice just loud enough to reach to
axson

   lose vun win vun grinned thf jew
 t hell with you and your bum jokes
snarled the girl with well-assumed anger
 gwan bo

  this to axson who started on down the
narrow stairs

  inside she clutched his arm again and
chuckled gleefully

   y see how it works aint i a slip-
pery one oh boy

  she led the way straight on past the rear
of the shop through the jews room
through the closet and then through the
secret panel down the steps in the utter
darkness they passed she tapped on the
wall at the end of the passage

  as in the morning so now the door
opened again the least fraction of an inch
and into the ray of light which issued from
it the girl stepped and tilted back her head
so that the watcher within could see her
face instantly the door opened half-way

  and heres a new pal of mine hes

o	k said the girl

   whats he got to let him through
growled the guard

   me she answered with angry em-
phasis  dont raise no fuss bo you
know me

   ill take a chance i guess said the
crook  cme in pal

  axson stepped through and the door in-
stantly closed behind him he could tell
by the sound of the click that it was of the
most massive material for good or ill he
was now fully in the hole-in-the-wall

  the girl was leading straight on down
the passage when they had turned the
first dimly lighted corner lie laid a hand on
her shoulder as she turned he caught her
by the throat wh both hands-not a hard
grip or else she should never have spoken
again but sufficiently close for him to stop
her voice if he wished he dragged her
close and tilted up her face it was white
as death and her eyes were supernaturally
wide

  you little cheat he whispered sav-
agely  dont you know ive used you
only as a tool if youve got prayers to
say make them quick this is your last
minute 

  for an instant with set teeth she glared
up at him and her mind was working with
the speed of a racing machine then she
made her determination after all it was
the only chance which remained to her

   damn you she sobbed softly  fin-
ish me then if larrys got no chance i
dont want to live

  he released her instantly

 i thought i saw you exchange a glance
with the second guard he said calmly
and i wanted to make sure but if
theres really a larry ill make my try to
get him away lead on 

  she hesitated just the fraction of an in-
stant then a perverse desire to question
him was too much for her

   have you come all this way without
knowing for yourself whether or not there
was a larry tell me that bo

   ive never believed you he answered
calmly  ive never believed all that you
told me but im acting on the chance that
any of it may be right go on were
wasting time

  for another instant she remained star-
ing at him lie could guess that some-
thing of importance was passing through
her mind he could not know that at the
last minute she was shrinking from her
part if he had smiled at her if he had
said a friendly word during that interval
he would have been saved but his grim
eyes held steadily into the distance he
looked more like a sphinx than a human
being and in sharp contrast the girl saw
the face of louis masters the handsome

features the large brown eyes she
turned on her heel

   make it snappy then were on our
way 

  they did not speak again all the time
they were winding through the passages
and down the last flight of steps into the
concrete hall

  here she halted again and pressed back
against him

  were almost there she whispered
 are you still game bo

   start on he muttered sternly

  not so loud she cautioned god
knows how many birds is around here i
aint trusted axson

   why do you stop here

its a crazy stunt axson lets go
back before its too late if we go back
now we can get clear without half trying
she had gaged him rightly he sneered
openly into her face

   ive come too far to turn back he
said

  and she muttered to herself  right
you are poor devil

  she went on down the passage and they
stopped before the ponderous door

   this she said

   how do you get through it

   i got the key in wax she said chuck-
ling in her triumph  and i filed out the
copy myself pretty bad eh look
she placed a shining key in the lock
he snatched it out and examined the
smooth surface

   you say that you filed out this key
she could not meet the grim question of
that glance but with wavering eyes she
lied with precision and rapidity

  that key hell no i i palmed off
my copy on the guard hes got it now
i wasnt sure it would work and i didnt
have a chance to try it out but i traded
him my key for his while he was drunk
this morning i hope to gawd he dont
get wise before to-morrow

  for an instant longer he maintained his
rigid scrutiny then he handed back the
key

 very well he said  open the door
the lock turned noiselessly the door
swung open a breath of prison damp

swept out to them from the hall a faint
light penetrated to the cell axson peered
inside

   my gawd groaned the girl  theyve
moved him

   no answered axson  whats that
over there in the comer - lying on the
ground

  where i see it larry

  the huddled object did not move
they got him doped moaned the
girl wringing her hands  they always
keep him doped wait here keep an eye
peeled ill go in and drag him out
once more she gaged his psychology
correctly as she started he caught her
shoulder and held her back

   you could not handle his weight said
axson  let me go

  and he stepped forward into the cell
even then she did not move she knew
that a wrong step an instant too soon would
undo her not till he had completely
crossed the floor of the cell did she act
then she seized the edge of the heavy
door at the same instant that he leaned
above the huddled figure

  the sheer weight of the door was against
her it hung back it dragged at her
shoulders it seemed to hang motionless
for a full second under her full effort be-
fore it began to stir

  and even as it started axson straight-
ened with a snarl like a baffled beast of
prey he straightened and whirled catlike
toward the girl her whole weight was on
the ponderous door now she was leaning
against it she sobbed with desperate
effort

  and now she saw his bulk leap into the
air with outstretched arms like a pounc-
ing panther right in his face the door
shut-clicked-and at the same instant the
shock of a terrific weight smashed against
it from within that blow made the door
shiver to the top

  she sprang back half triumphant half
terrified once more the weight smashed
against the door shaking it terribly but
it held the wood was massive the
frame would have withstood the battering
of a catapult

  only when she saw this did martha
when minnie fell



 perce straighten ancl sigh with relief she
 turned to go then hesitated and at last
 turned back and stood with her mouth
 close to the little iron shutter in the center
 of the door

  axson she called

  i hear you he answered

 his voice was perfectly calm

to be concluded next week

  im goiijg to try to get them to deal
 easily with you she said

 something like soft laughter answered
 her

  i mean it so help me god axson
 will you try to forgive me

 again there was the faintest chuckle a
 chill ran through her heart

                              dont forget this magazine is issued weewy ami
that you will get the conclusion of this story without waiting a month

	insufferably hot minnie come

  i	 i and open the window at once the

  	heat in this place is enough to bake
me alive minnie

  there was no reply to her call and na-
talie grandon frowned with irritation as
she hurried across her dressing-room and
opened the top and lower sashes of the
window when she turned and dropped
her opera cloak across the back of a chair
her maid appeared in the doorway that
communicated with natalies room

   im sorry miss murmured the maid
blinking  i just went off-

   never mind about making excuses
interrupted her mistress  ive opened the
window myself but another time please re-
member that  am not an orchard or a na-
tive of the tropics

  u yes miss returned minnie obediently
and stifling a yawn placed a chair in front
of the dressing-table natalie seated her-
self and the maid knelt to exchange miss
grandons satin shoes for slippers

  this duty performed natalie removed
the numerous rings and bracelets that
adorned her fingers and arms  now my
collar she ordered and minnies deft fin-
gers pressed the clasp that secured miss
grandons chief article of jewelry

  this chef-dceuvre of the jewelers art
justly deserves a word to itself for not only
was it extremely valuable but it was ex-
traordinarily beautiful and of uncommon
design composed of diamonds rubies and
pearls it was an object of envy among na-
talies circle of friends and a desirable piece
of loot for any crook clever enough to jay
hands on it and-get away with it

   it always makes me nervous mur-
mured the maid as she laid the collar on
the dressing table

   nervous why

   because somebody might steal it i
shall be glad when you send it back to the
safe deposit miss

   dont be absurd minnie what good
would it be to me if t kept it locked up

all the time come let down my hair and
then get me my dressing-gown i think ill
read a little before i go to bed what time
is it one oclock well never mind you
need not call me until ten so that will give
you a good rest

   yes miss agreed the maid with the
readiness expected of a well-paid and
trained automaton

  while her hair was being released na-
talie sat back at her ease and contemplated
two very satisfying objects one was her
own reflection in the mirror the other
was her collar but exquisite as was this last
it should be admitted that natalie grandon
gave the palm to her own fair features

   now get my gown she ordered as her
hair fell iu a cloudy mass about her shoul-
ders and idly watched in the mirror as her
maid turned and walked toward the ward-
robe

  for the space of three seconds the room
was as silent as any young society ladys
should be three soft noiseless steps did
minnie make then came a crash a shrill
scream and the maid fell headlong

  startled out of her reverie natalie
whirled round she stared in amazement
at the havoc that had been wrought min-
nie the demure and trim lay sprawling on
the floor a small table was overturned
and scattered around was a miscellaneous
assortment of articles and the broken pieces
of a flower vase

  miss grandon made a gesture of im-
patient annoyance

   how could you be so careless she
commenced crossly then as minnie strug-
gled groaning to a sitting posture natalie
sprang from her chair  are you hurt
she cried in alarm

   not much i think ive-oh ive
cut my hand i tripped i couldnt help
falling i-

  the maid broke off sobbing and natalie
helped her to her feet

   do stop she urged as she examined
the cut on minnies hand  its not very
bad here let me tie it up in this towel

  minnie wiped her eyes and stood quietly
while her mistress rendered first aid dur-
ing the moment that natalie bent over the
temporary bandage minnies eyes strayed

toward the dressing table she wrenched
her hand away suddenly

   did you move your collar she cried

   my collar no what is the matter
with you i havent touched it its
gotie

  side by side mistress and maid stared at
the dressing-table together they rushed
to see if the precious band of jewels had
fallen to the floor and frantically they
sought and found-nothing no hint of
how or where it had gone

   this is incomprehensible-bewilder-
ing gasped natalie  it was there and
now-

   the window exclaimed the maid

  	nonsense it is only open a few
inches resides no one could climb up
and reach it the idea is absurd yet-

   its gone whispered minnie

   and some one must have taken it so it
is useless standing here doing nothing
cried natalie  im going to call up the
police and tell them to send a detective at
once no dont leave the room minnie
theres no purpose to be served by alarm-
ing the whole household for heavens
sake be quiet

  minnie was now crying hysterically but
her mistress though pale and worried was
calm and purposeful her message to the
police station was clear and free from need-
less words

   you see she said to her maid when
she hung up  it will be much easier for
the detective to solve the mystery if we
remain here until he comes while we are
waiting we mil make anodier search
and-

  hie sound of two shots in quick suc-
cession came from the garden below na-
talie stood rigid the maid sank moaning
on a settee

   something dreadfuls happened she
gasped and her tears fell in real earnest

  miss grandon glanced down at the girl
with contempt

   dont be silly she snapped  i only
hope it is the beast who took my necklace
that is shot

  minnie lifted a pale tear-stained face
 but how- she commenced no one
could get into the room
when minnie fell	

   dont ask me how retorted natalie
as she went to the window  thats for
the detective to say all i know is that
my collar has gone and if it isnt in this
room the inference is obvious possibly
some one was on a ladder and reached
through the window with a stick

   i know you couldnt have taken it and
as forty thousand dollars worth of gems
cannot take wings and fly there must be
some reasonable answer the servants are
out now searching the grounds-i can see
their flashlights and heres a car coming
up the drive it must be the detective

   quick minnie get my gown while i
pin up my hair i told him to come
straight to this room

  true to her instructions detective ros-
siter entered two minutes after his car had
stopped in front of the house he listened
without interruption while natalie gave a
detailed account of what had taken place
now and again his eyes drifted casually
in the direction of minnie who sat huddled
on the settee

   peculiar he said when natalie came
to a pause  ii-m very strange you
say you have searched the floor

   practically everywhere in  this room
 did you examine your own clothes
miss grandon flushed slightly  do
you mean to insinuate that i-

  the detective raised a protesting hand
i am only suggesting the possibility of an
accident he said  the collar might
have fallen and clung to your dress

   then my maid shall search me and
satisfy you on that score it is useless to
search for as i have already told you she
did  not once approach the dressing-table
after placing the collar there in fact she
did not move from behind my chair until
she went to get my dressing gown

   now minnie just run your hands over
me and sec if by any chance i have my own
property concealed about my person
there was a sarcastic note in miss gran-
don s voice as she gave this order and a
haughty tilt to her chin but rossiter
seemed in no wise perturbed or particu-
larly disappointed when the collar did not
show up

   it disappeared when minnie fell he

muttered staring at die carpet  let me
see this room is on the third floor was
that window open

   just as you see it now

   no more than that-

   i has not been moved up or down since
i opened it myself said natalie

   and the shots have you any idea what
they meant

   no i have not inquired   saw that
the noise had awakened the servants and
they were searching the grounds when you
arrived there listen it seems as if
they had found something

   ill go down and see grunted ros-
siter maybe the clue to the mystery is
downstairs

  when the detective reached the hall a
body was being carried in by a couple of
pallid-faced men servants

   shot twice through the head mut-
tered rossiter as he bent over the dead
man and rapidly searched his pockets he
did not find anything that connected the
stranger with the disappearance of the
collar and immediate examination of the
flower-beds under miss gran dons window
showed no trace of footprints or marks of
a ladder

  the spot where the body had been founq
was some thirty feet distant from the house
shot from behind the man evidently had
been hiding for some purpose but the de-
tective traced his footsteps from the road
to a clump of bushes where he had been
slain

  at that point the dead mans trail ended
he had not been near the house

  all this and proof that no one had
climbed into miss grandons window the
detective verified by daylight at every
new line of plausible explanation he met
with a check no theory fitted the circum-
stance there was no clue to be found in-
side or outside the collar was gone and
the rest was-confusion

  miss grandon was above suspicion the
dead man was a doubtful factor inasmuch
that he was found in the grounds but he
had not been near the house and there was
nothing to connect his murder with the rob-
bery of the collar

  natalie herself declared that minnie had


all-story weekly

not approached the dressing-table what
was the answer

  back in his office the detective cudgeled
his brains no one had entered the house
none had left it yet-when minnie fell the
gems had vanished

  the phrase repeated itself over and over
again in the detectives mind he could
not rid himself of the constant repetition
of the three simple silly words

   she said she tripped up he muttered
 over what ill go back and look things
over again this afternoon meanwhile
theres a dead man to identify and a mur-
derer to find

ii

  it was late in the afternoon when de-
tective rossiter reached the grandon house
and he was not altogether displeased to find
that natalie was not at home the house-
keeper showed him into the dressing-room
and left him to his own devices

  he made the most of his opportunity of
investigating unhampered by observers
indeed if any one had been watching they
would have said that detective rossiter was
anything but a hustler or a keen sleuth
for the greater part of half an hour he sat
on the settee with half-closed eyes endeav-
oring to visualize to reconstruct the scene

  then he got up and peered into the bed-
room he saw nothing of note but he
heard something that caused him to wrinkle
his brows it wasnt much only the sound
of low sobbing but it was enough to send
him tiptoeing into the corridor there he
coughed loudly and walked with heavy
tread to a door that he judged opened
into a room beyond miss grandons

   i reckon it is the maids room he re-
flected and observed that when he stood
outside the door the sobbing ceased he
knocked and minnie came to the door
she was red-eyed and there was a look of
one bereaved on her face

   sorry to disturb you said the detec-
tive  but would you mind getting me a
hammer oh and by the way do you re-
member what you tripped over

   the carpet there must have been a
ruck in it

   ah yes of course that was it well
ill wait in the dressing-room while you go
for the hammer

  rossiter did wait in the dressing-room
but only long enough to ascertain that the
carpet was tightly stretched and nailed all
round the room and to give minnie time
to reach the basement then he trans-
ferred himself with remarkable quickness
to the maids room forty-five seconds
was the limit of his stay there and when
minnie returned she found him waiting on
the settee

  entirely for the maids benefit the de-
tective accepted the hammer and solemnly
tapped on the walls and the fact that min-
nie sniffed at his futile behavior bothered
him not at all

  before he left the house rossiter pledged
the housekeeper to secrecy and asked her
twojuestions when was the oil heater in
the maids room filled wras it ever used
in miss grandons dressing-room

  he learned that the heater had been filled
the day before and that according to na-
talies orders it was never placed in hor
room strangely enough the two trivial
circumstances caused rossiter to congratu-
late himself he was far from being able
to locate the missing collar and was still
laboring in the dark but he glimpsed a dis-
tant guiding ray of light

  during his visit to the maids room he
had seen by the indicator on the heater
that it had been burned several hours
also he had noticed four telltale curved
marks on the soft pile of the carpet near
natalies dressing table

   so far so good he murmured as he
left the house  now to look up the his-
tory of the man who was shot and to play
a waiting game

  for three days rossiter resolutely kept
out of communication with natalie gran-
don on the fourth day he called on the
young lady and lugubriously informed her
that neither he nor any of the police had
any due or hope of recovering her jeweled
collar

  miss grandon did not disguise her scorn
or indignation and rossiter received her
scathing remarks in humble silence even
minnies smile was superior and disdainful
when minnie fell



and she tossed her head with open dispar-
agement when he left the room on an er-
rand for her mistress

  then in a twinkling there came a sur-
prising change over the detective his
whispered words caused natalie to open
her eyes in astounded amazement

   that was a bluff announced rossiter
 i have discovered some evidence that may
perhaps lead to recovery of your collar
but all depends on your keeping up the
pretense that i have given over the case

   tell everybody what a fool dub  am
and let it be understood that you have re-
linquished all hope of getting back your
gems remember theres forty thousand
dollars worth of jewels that youll probably
never see again if you give the slightest
hint of the truth

  a week later rossiter traced the man
that had been found dead in front of the
grandon house but although he found that
the mans name was fayette and made
some interesting discoveries regarding his
antecedents he failed to connect with the
one who had shot him

  while he was thus at a standstill the one
event he had deliberately played for took
place the news came simultaneously to
him from one of his watchers and miss
grandon

   minnies beat it came the message
from the associate detective who had been
tipped off to watch the grandon house

   my maid has left me telephoned miss
grandon

   of her own accord asked rossiter

   yes in a way i discharged her be-
cause she insisted on having more money

  the detective smiled as he replaced the
receiver

   so minnie has found a way of slipping
free without giving reason for suspicion
he murmured  clever girl that she
doesnt wait on chance to serve her turn
she dont trip up unless she means to fall

   i wonder if shell lead where i want to
follow if so and ive doped it out all
right theres some thats been sniggering at
me thatll have to hand me a boo-kay

   theres nothing like letting a chicken
think youre an old has-been or a never-
waser

  for thirty-six hours following minnies
departure from the employ of natalie she
did nothing that gave her watchers any
help in support of the theory that rossiter
had formed but the detective counseled
caution and patience

   shes laying low he declared when it
was reported that minnie had been to sev-
eral employment agencies and was hunting
a job  depend upon it that a woman
who had self-control enough to hide her
feelings on the night that fayette was shot
is not likely to give herself away bv doing
anything in a hurry

   when i found her crying in her room
i had my doubts about her doubled and
since we now have proof that she was
fayettes wife i guess it is worth while
giving her all the rope she wants i know
she put that heater in miss grandons room
and although i havent the least idea where
that collar went to its a million dollars to
a peanut shell that minnie fayette had her
finger in the pie

   if we arrest her on suspicion shell
play dumb and well lose the goods let
her rip it is an even chance that shes
after revenge and that connects us with the
guy who finished fayette

  soon word came from rossiters shadows
that the moment was ripe for him to get on
the job

iii

  by nine oclock on the evening of the
second day the mystery of the vanished
collar was solved with the jewels in his
pocket and three prisoners rossiter arrived
at the station house and told his story
and as he had successively bagged the
murderer of fayette a receiver of stolen
goods and minnie he wras listened to with
absorbed interest

   this woman here he stated pointing
to minnie fayette  engineered the whole
business after i received the message that
she was trailing round hangouts that are not
usually frequented by ladys maids i picked
up her trail and followed her to this mans
house i heard her accuse him of killing
her husband but he-

   i did it in self-defense cried the
younger of the two men fayette wouldnt


all-story weekly

pass on the collar as wed agreed i
grabbed his gun and-

   shut up snapped rossiter  you can
tell your yarn later all that i care about
now is the fact that you killed fayette
sloped with the collar and cashed it with
this old fence here youre all in the soup
and the judge  fix the responsibility where
it belongs

  the detective turned again to the lieu-
tenant  there was a whole lot of talk
between minnie and this man he con-
tinued  but to cut it short it amounted to
her agreeing to accept half what the re-
ceiver had promised her husbands mur-
derer

   i tagged after them when they went to
the fences place they all started squeal-
ing one on the other when i showed up
and here they are all merry and bright
this -the detective laid the collar on the
lieutenants desk- i found in the re-
ceivers house and these-a gun and this
ball of fish-line-were hidden in the other
fellers room it explains a good deal that
fogged us have a look at it and youll see
how they got away with that collar

   cute murmured the lieutenant as he
unwound the ball and examined the string
 well youd better cut along to miss
grandon you can tell us the rest later
i guess we cap take care of these beauties
until you get back

  although the jeweled collar was held
pending the prosecution of minnie and the
others natalie grandon was graciousness
itself and lavish in her praise of the de-
tectives keenness and patience

  u from beginning to end said the de-
tective after he had given the details of
the gradual building up of his suspicions
 it was one of those rare cases that are
well thought out and baffle by their very
simplicity every move you made was
forced upon you when you returned from
the opera

   there are the marks of the heater that
minnie kept in your room until just before
you were due she was no more sleepy
than i am it was a plant to practically
compel you to open the window yourself
if you had not done so minnie would have
had to do it herself or they would have

waited for another chance the fact that
you did it lessened the possibility of con-
necting her with the robbery

   but how was it i didnt see the string

i	distinctly remember that there was noth-
ing on the comer of my dressing table when
that wicked girl took off my collar

  u ill show you said rossiter  in the
first place you must remember you had no
suspicions and therefore had no reason for
looking closely i doubt even now that
you know how you were tricked if you will
be able to see the snare that was laid ready
for the moment that had been foreseen by
fayette and his wife

  while we were talking the detective went
to the window and threw out the ball of
fish line as it curved downward the ball
unwound and fell within a yard of the spot
where fayette had waited for the collar
and-for death the line hung straight
down the side of the house and when ros-
siter closed the window the remaining
length of painted string blended with the
wall and carpet

  why it is barely noticeable ex-
claimed natalie  you are right i would
certainly fail to see it unless i knew it were
there

   then how about this asked rossiter
as he brought the string up the back of the
dressing-table you can see what is
knotted at the end of the string now

   a piece of catgut

  the detective nodded  now look he
said as he laid the loop of catgut flat on
the lace cover 

  it is almost invisible cried miss
grandon  then minnie had only to slip
my collar through the loop and fasten the
catch

   of course and the sound of your collar
as it was jerked away was entirely covered
by the noise that was made when minnie
fell the racket was bound to make you
turn round and her scream was the signal
for her confederate to haul away

   that was the crucial moment but min-
nie didnt trip or stub her toe by accident
for there was no crease or ruck in the car-
pet that little lie she told helped some
the marks of the heater helped some more
and the rest-was easy

battle

sheriff placard had divided his
little army into several posses and
sent them into the waning glory
breaks by different routes to sweep the
country for the cattle-stealers or for traces
of them the forces of the law-of the
common public sentiment against the in-
dependents who were outlaws and for that
reason desperadoes-had the advantage of
numbers but were at a disadvantage of
working against the hiding craft of the
rustlers

  until placard and his own posse rode
over the ridge and looked down upon that
astonishing that amazing herd in the long
valley which hardly one of them had ever
heard of let alone seen they had no idea
of what they were seeking except that it
was a little band of cattle-thieves

  sheriff placard conscious of the necessity
of routing out the waning glory breaks
bandits with their long record of crimes
unpunished had made what was supposed
to be a mere little foray against owned
cattle the occasion of a real man-hunt-to
the finish in this a number of urgent
forces had joined-the protectors and
avengers of banks endangered by hold-ups
the police forces of railroads whose trains
were occasionally stopped and looted ex-
press companies who hated the pilferers of
stages mine-camp bullion-carriers and

special express-cars and ranches whose
horse and cattle herds had suffered depre-
dations

  this was to be a round-up of the thieves
and their reputed rendezvous away back in
the waning glory breaks was to be visit-
ed surrounded and the battle of extermi-
nation fought up to the log cabin doors
or to the entrance of their cave in the
mountain or wherever they happened to be
cornered

  accordingly posses and men-hunters
including some few adventurous inde-
pendents seeking a look-in on the inevitable
distribution of rewards were converging
from several directions and if it happened
that sheriff placard was the first to strike
into the raiders within the radius were
other groups of men equally eager to come
upon the banded outlaws

  within a few miles therefore-a few
miles speaking in the desert sense-were
trackers and searchers dragging the wide
country for sign or sight of the human
quarry while placard was rushing head-
long with his own little group into the
cunning ambuscade of the desperate sugar
others were looking with astonishment at
that most unexpected display of the
prowess and unspeakable nerve of the des-
peradoes

  theyve stolen the herd chief ar-
tent of the transmissouri empire railroad
detective force laughed shortly  well
ill be-

this story began in the allstory weekly for may 




all-story weekly

  with him were only three other men like
himself wage-paid men-hunters they
didnt rush pell-mell down out of their ob-
servatory all in a flurry to come upon the
herd and its well-guarded flanks instead
they all turned and looked up the valley in
the direction in which the animals were
moving calculating with broad western
experience what the probable movements
would be during the rest of that day and
that coming night and into the following
hours of sunshine

  they dismounted behind the crest of the
ridge they had climbed from the east and
sitting down to a cold snack talked it over
while they ate they talked an hour lying
back leisurely while their horses found
comfort in some little tufts of grass near
by every minute or two one or other
would look down at the herd miles dis-
tant and coming back make some little
comment

   theyre tending right to business-
theyre in a hurry was their united be-
lief

  they studied the lay of their own land
to the northward and when they moved on
it was in the direction the herd was going
over a rough and difficult course and they
had no doubt but what they were going
faster than the herd which was southwest
of them when they looked over the crcst
toward the herd they removed their hats
and raised their heads behind some bush
or between rocks-no need to warn them
against showing themselves silhouetted
against the sky-line with such game as that
riding herd down there in the valley

  they saw a man on horseback come out
of their own side of the valley and ride to
join the herders that was a phenomenon
to be studied this man had two horses
riding one and driving the other ahead-
and that other had a saddle on it the
railroad detectives asked one another if
there hadnt already been shooting away
down south somewhere with an empty
saddle to show for it they didnt know
they could only surmise

  if they watched the herd they also lost
no track of their other surroundings they
read with practised eyes signs in the cat-
tle trails they crossed in riding to head the

herd in the valley outlet gap here were
tracks of cattle that had been driven down
into the valley from the east they even
found a bunch of cattle in a valley they
followed for several miles-strays they
figured from the eatle-thieves loot or
animals that hadnt been able to travel fast
enough to satisfy tine raiders

  they shore brought em far back
chief artent remarked  must be twenty-
five miles as the crows fly-y-r brands
and some double-headed serpents too
where the devil d that brand come from
anyhow

   old cuss name of marvel-same one
they named the ranch after-patented that
brand one of the others replied he
was pisen himself coming in from south
dakota when it got too hot for him so
he took that brand it was kind of a
warning but the snake-heads is lost their
fangs

   looks like look t that herd

   like old times-in texas after the
war artent continued  then they took
what they found-theres more n two
thousand there-rdid those fools think they
could get away with them

   looks like a morose man-hunter
shook his head adding  sposin this
was last week

  	or day before yesterday artent
looked toward the gap in the mountains
 yes or yesterday or last night taint
so fur to that door in the range

   how wides it one asked  just a
canon thats all

   coinin down we crossed that range to
the eastward artent remarked  thats
close by h-m

  so they speculated as they rode along
sparing their horses the best they could
but determined to head the desperadoes and
the herd suddenly they rode right out
into another group of men who had come
down out of the east

  they stopped short and ready the
two parties their weapons aquiver searched
one another then artent threw back his
coat and his badge gleamed visibly he
had seen a flash on another chest across
the interval he rode over to them and
a minute later the other followed suit
janie and the waning glories



  briefly word was exchanged then ar-
tent took one of the other group up to a
crest and showed him the spectacle over in
the big valley

   well by the love o hades the other
gasped  what dye make o that
artent laughed shortly the two rode
back and the leader of the newcomers told
his followers in flowery oaths what he had
seen then they all loped along northward
artent leading the others following

   im damned glad yo come under-
sheriff artent said sincerely  i hadnt
any longing to get into them with just us
now were-

  no need to complete the sentence they
traveled fast and they kept looking down
at the herd which was quickening as the
cattle smelled water out of the northward
there in the canon gap in the range but
it was a tired herd at that-the herders
were leaving strays behind them animals
that couldnt keep up the pace and calves
that were too weak to follow in the drive

  with ten men artents project was less
desperate and he drove faster getting his
men ahead of the herd so that as the
afternoon waned he was ahead of them
and at sunset he boldly ran down into the
plain and across the head of the herd with
all his men stretched out behind him

  he had won the race-the legal authori-
ties had come into their own-and charg-
ing in upon the bold drivers they rode to
give battle in the open feeling that wth
their fresher horses and the vengeance of
the law behind the desperadoes must quail
and count the odds

  the rustlers saw what they were up
against and they all rode up to the point
where snowflake and dishpan were in the
way of the attack tarcass came through
the herd from the other point and the
six men stood for a minute during the
breathless dash of the exultant posse who
had their quarry out there in the open on
tired horses and with no cover

  some one fired from a running horse
instantly others began to shoot the des-
peradoes replied for a number of seconds
and then as dishpan and tarcass lurched
down from their saddles the others turned
and fled they bumped into the cattle of

the herd sugar his own horse shot from
hip to shoulder by a - bullet leaped
to the back of a lank steer a wild maverick
and the animal mad with terror dashed
westward sugar bull-frogging him and
hanging on until they were beyond the
herd when taking off his hat the fish-
eyed youth waved a weird wild farewell

  the devils own burke was hit again
by a bullet but disappeared in the night
while the horsemen raced at his very heels
snowflake his horse shot under him rose
with his pistols in each hand to fight-
and he did fight till the bullets that hit him
broke him down and he fainted where he
sagged

  another band of bandits had been broken
up of whom only two had gotten clear
away-burke and sugar but burke was
bleeding and probably couldnt survive
when the bloody seconds had been passed
the posse turned to succor its own wounded
-three and two dead that was added
to the price paid to destroy this gang

  when they had bound up the wounds
and caught the horses to tether them till
they could move on artent and under-
sheriff plickner looked over the spoils of
their united efforts-a glance at the herd
of cattle and a good examination of the
four desperadoes two of whom were dead

   well by the lord harry one of the
white face cattle ranch men cried  if
here aint janie fretes whole outfit

  then and not till then did the victors
discern the significance of their discovery

   janie fretes outfit plickner turned
to the cowboy  sure of that

   aint that the hoss she rode come we
met her an that fellow there-tarcass
the cowboy turned to his slower-witted
side-partner the only two from grisps out-
fit

   thats right-tarcass an-an snow-
flake they called him

  the horses of the desperadoes confirmed
the suspicion their brands were mussed
up so badly as to be almost illegible big
teeth dead now was without any brand

  the battle had not passed unnoticed in
that valley of vast views within two hours
another posse rode in angry because it had
not been in range for the fight a sage-

brush and cedar-trunk fire brought in oth-
ers till dawn when more than forty men
had arrived and as they began to turn
the herd back in the morning some one
discerned a lone figure in the distance a
mere speck to look at but one that made
many antics in the mirage of the valley

  the fleck resolved itself into a man on
foot upon which several rode out to round
him up-they found valero choking and
staggering thirsty and hungry his feet raw
in his shoes hatless and without firearms-
a frightened and miserable man

  and out of the hills struggled sheriff
placard and the remainder of his posse-
to seek help now that the desperadoes had
been worsted they had ridden in to the
defense and had their dead and wounded
to bring in but if there were dead men
and suffering wounded these were nothing
compared to the visible evidence of the
success of the raid into the rendezvous of
the waning glory breaks desperadoes

  there were nearly three thousand head
of catlle and sight of them refreshed even
the famished heart of tremaine valero
he saw their white faces and their bodies
deep with beef his beef-and uintahs

  the herd was worth more than two hun-
dred thousand dollars-and that would
satisfy the woman having eaten and
drank coffee valero was sufficiently recov-
ered to ride one of the desperados horses
he waxed generous he promised all the
posse  something he calculated in his
narrow soul however how little he could
give them and not be called mean

  he heard with pleasure that the rewards
on the heads of the captured or killed des-
peradoes woulcj go up to several hundred
dollars per member of the posse-sheriff
placards and the independents who had
appeared to that hour a thousand dol-
lars he figured would let him out

artent and the under-sheriff rode apart
and discussed the situation and the bits
of information that had come to them

that information was amazing janie

flange the man who had murdered asra
clement over in the country south of salt
lake in the desert there he answered
the description and in his saddle were the
initials m d f and the saddle otherwise
answered the description in the notice of
reward sent out by clements friends

  the indications were not to be ignored
and accordingly sheriff placard chief ar-
tent valero as owner and four good men
left the herd and struck through the breaks
ahead of the main group of men ostensi-
bly they were going out to get assistance
for the wounded men especially medical
and surgical care in fact they had what
was at least as important a part of their
errand from the legal viewpoint

  they rode as fast as they could on their
worn horses but they felt little fear of
being out-traveled they rode as straight
as they could with what information they
had about the lay of the land till they
looked down upon the two-day spring pass
there they stumbled out into the plain of
thirsty creek valley and turned south-
ward at quickening pace to janie fretes
ranch

  it was night but bright moonlight they
left their horses and surrounded the place
so that they could cover it from ail di-
rections dawn was just come when they
had completed their ambuscades then
placard and artent rode boldly up to the
front door and hailed and immediately
the front door opened and screaming eagle
stepped out

   what she stared at the sheriff and
the two men rushed up past her and into
the sitting-room

  these sitting on the floor was janie
frete holding the head of burke the
wounded outlaw

  burke was just beyond their power
though a grin flickered over his counte-
nance as he looked up at the sheriff and the
chief detective who with four guns waving
were keeping one eye on him and peering
into the other rooms
janie and the waning glories



  too late placard burke whispered
 i got here-first

  that was all the man conscious and
taunting the law to the last shook loose
from his body with its hundred old scars
and fresh wounds

  placard stood looking from the dead man
to janie who till this moment had remained
dry-eyed now her tears flowed but nev-
ertheless she gazed at the sheriff with a
directness that was embarrassing

   too late placard ejaculated  huh

-	i reckon not we got you-too late
screaming eagle divined the meaning of
that phrase first and sprang before the
sheriff with her hands raised and her fin-
gers drawn up like eagle claws the sher-
iff stepped back hastily and turned his
brutal guns on her whereupon she laughed
 shoot a woman shoot a woman

   bring in the others placard said to
artent who stepping outside shouted up
to the ambushed men	

  valero hurried up limping and when
he entered upon the tableau in janies
sitting-room before the fireplace he
straightened rather importantly and gazed
with stern expression at the young woman
and at the man lying dead there

   well he remarked  seems to me
youtre gotten into big business out here
rather promptly

   and you janie inquired softly
valero for reply blinked it was part
of his creed that looking and acting impor-
tantly meant half the battle in business
the other half depended on being ready
and with a sudden thought he felt in his
inner pocket the wallet was there also
getting his bade to those present by the
window he assured himself that the slip
of paper which gave him the ownership of
the trenal brand cattle was safe in its little
pocket

   for a few minutes the new arrivals gath-
ered their breaths and then placard
thought of something

   say-we want to send out a car to
bring in surgeons

   i beg pardon janie interrupted
 thats already done i sent one of my
men in my car to racklack hours ago i
knew-men were wounded

    	a-s

   which man placard demanded

   chippy she replied scornfully stand-
ing erect now  what of him do you
want-do you know him

   i dont know-but id like a look t
him placard replied grimly

  janie had done many things that morn-
ing after in the early hours burke had
come in with the story of the bloody fights
over in the waning glory breaks he had
come knowing now that he was dying to
warn her he had urged her to go into
flight because on her would fall the oppro-
brium of having become a member of the
desperado band

   we was afeared of that burke had
said  but we took a chanst-an lost
you see-

  with terse desert english he told her
their great plan and how they had gath-
ered that herd over in the valley where
they could drive it out for her and ship it
-and she would have a stack of money to
show for her efforts to come back again
having fought so hard they could appre-
ciate that those desperadoes falsely ac-
cused in the beginning but not bad and
glad of it with no liking for anything else

   want hit a good joke he had plead-
ed as he saw janies thoughtful face upon
that revelation that her own cattlemen had
stripped the plains of thirsty creek valley
and brought down on the waning glory
bandits the wrath of the marvelando and
white face cattle companies one other
thing he had told her too which she did
not on the instant grasp in its full mean-
ing

   youd have me laugh-with you-
you janie had cried

   smile janie he had pleaded  jes
smile-sos ill know- the boys  know
you understand we lowed to favor yo
j anie-an -an- sli 

  he had heard the coming of the sheriff
and his companion he had reached to
draw his guns but janie had stopped that
and janie had smiled on him and kissed
him-assured him that she understood-
which she did not quite but would not
have him know her feelings of predicament
and uncertainty then the sheriff and ar-
tent had entered


all-story weekly

  janie having paused to send chippy for
surgeons had also ordered the indians
wagon hitched up and the indians to go to
bring in the wounded men screaming
eagle telling her that they would know
where to go to meet the coming cortege and
hospital band

   why not the truck janie asked
 over the waning breaks road the boys
know about

  accordingly the motor truck was sent by
the secret road out into the waning glo-
ries over which the bandits had brought
in the ranch supplies including the truck
-to the mystification of the marvelando
outfit who had seen no truck track in the
road they knew to janies ranch

   youre a prisoner of course placard
assured janie who made no least comment
but valero found opportunity to talk with
her off to one side

   now my fine lady he remarked
after the squinting-eyed confidence of his
kind  you see what youre up against
queen of these- waning glory bandits and
rounding up my cattle under cover of your
ranch here but ive no hard feelings
youre a pretty high stepper and all that
out here we like good-lookers and we go
easy as a rule on times like these

   now if youll just say the word ill
have a little talk with placard and well
enable you to play the innocent victim and
all that see what say eh girl

  he reached to rest his hand on janies
knee with a familiarity that to him
seemed the finest of friendly symptoms
but janie said softly

   you touch me you scoundrel and ill
blow your brains out

  that was all valero was frozen in his
gesture he realized on the instant that
though janie was a prisoner she had not
yet been searched that a bandit queen
must inevitably have a revolver or pistol
handy was a foregone conclusion

  at the same time his wrath was raised
to the highest power of his expression he
had offered janie an opportunity to escape
the penalty of her association with the
desert band of criminals by what seemed
to him to be a rather complimentary asso-
ciation with himself

   all right he sniffed  then ill-

   youll think twice janie interrupted
 youll think twice and the second time
youll think right

   huh  he grinned but the careless look
in his greed-faded eyes almost immediately
changed as he added  what do you
mean

   i mean the law of the land she re-
plied and thereupon he did not laugh but
shuddered

   thats with me he declared harshly
 you know it 

   do you she asked and left him to
go into the kitchen there to help scream-
ing eagle get the breakfast which she had
ordered for the newcomers while the sheriff
and his posse at her suggestion brought
down the cots and prepared the bungalow
for the work to come they made a hos-
pital of it and in that work there was no
division in the people there

  they had that first task of all to attend
to-the succor of the injured men who
were coming slowly and with such terrible
pains as the men wounded in the depths
of pathless desert must endure before they
come at last to some ranch and into the
hands of surgeons

  the injured and the dead were brought
in toward the end of that day anw the
racklack doctor was there to attend to
them a little later the greengrass sur-
geons arrived with the ambulance not far
behind

  the surgery was the best available and
during that difficult task janie and scream-
ing eagle toiled with the doctors good
women and even quite experienced in such
an emergency screaming eagle had
tended gunshot wounds before and janie
knew their horrible look

  but the herd did not arrive till after all
these things and as janie had been in-
dispensable to the wounded men sheriff
placard had not attempted to take her on
to racklack and around to his own court
town

  the stolen herd now salvaged came
down out of the waning glories with
more than thirty men driving them-a won-
derful sight all hands including snow-
flake got out to see the spectacle and
janie and the waning glories



sheriff placard would not have missed it
himself

  he and valero and chief artent rode
out to meet it and they returned on the
points valero with his broad-brimmed hat
aslant and with such a feeling of owner-
ship and importance as never had sat upon
him before

   three thousand head he blinked  i
can hardly believe it

   say valero placard hailed him after
looking the cattle over rather generally and
particularly  i was just noticing-the
boys were remarking-these here cows is
all branded with horned-as

-	chapter xnxix

valero plays a trump

it was a fact riding along with nearly
twoscore men to  head of cattle-
the largest stolen herd seen in many a
day out there-the men of the posses had
not failed to notice the cattle and their
brands and before long it was said that
they were mostly horned-as and then
they said by the gee-whiz the only animals
that werent horned-as were calves that
hadnt been branded or had been freshly
branded with y-r in the bitrings or with
the familiar snake-brand of the marvelando
ranch

  instantly a rumor a surmise supported
by the hints of some of the white face
cattle ranch cowmen indicated that these
cattle were all the trenal herd and  no-
body knows who owns them the doubt
that settled upon the posse herders was
with them when sheriff placard valero
and chief artent rode out leaving guards
at the ranch to make sure that janie frete
didnt make a break to get away

  placard a doubt now in his own soul
with a vision that always lurks like a night-
mare over a sheriffs office turned to valero
worried by a contingency that was like iron
in his own soul

  valero didnt answer as he mustered the
proper expression and the nonchalance
needed for such an occasion-the muster-
ing proving a rather difficult thing to do

   look here valero placard urged-

 look what weve done to those boys-
trenal ranch boys that was herding
trenals cattle how about it

  a second thought had settled upon the
sheriffs soul sensitive in that direction
and he continued aloud to valero-

   how about it man why-gosha-
mighty if theyre- theres for me a
hundred-thousand-dollar damage suit see
that her cowboys-if she hired em in
good faith not knowing-

   why worry valero turned to him
rather grandly and with that he reached
over the paper which indicated that
trenal had further protected the mortgage
on his ranch by a conveyance and quit-
claim on the cattle belonging to the
ranch

  reading it placard handed it to the de-
tective chief artent who also readit
placard wiped the sweat from his forehead
greatly relieved to have that so satisfac-
torily over with

  they brought the cattle slowly down the
valley to the neighborhood of the ranch
buildings and valero white-faced and blue-
lipped with the tense hour that was his
scowling and his face drawn as he steeled
himself to this tiling that he was doing saw
janie walking down her steps and out to
meet them by her side hobbled snow-
flake the wounded man who whatever his
wounds had come along to stand by the
woman who had employed him

   sheriff he began  me n the boys
knowed those cattle belonged to trenal and
we cut out every white face cattle and
marvelando brand in the whole valley-
knowing what to expect some calves got
through branded by those fellows valero
here and crisps men-but branded out
of their mothers brands

   they cant deny it-stealing trenals
herd as fast as they could why the hell
did you brand them calves off their mothers
brands you valero-whyd you do it
snowflake a big burly man stretched up
to his full height pale with the loss of
blood and indignant with his whole soul
put the question to valero-of all ques-
tions die  one that every listener knew he
must answer there and then 

  placard and artent especially stared at


all-story weekly

him astounded valero hushed and shriv-
eled up visibly his already agitated sou
had heaped upon it a greater burden-ancl
he glanced about to find that on him was
fixed the questioning direct western gaze
in all its various phases

   they were mine-they were ours he
cried f to do as we damned pleased
with

  he raised aloft his little slip of paper
he turned to the sheriff and said his voice
rising to an excited shriek

  here here read em this read
em this that  show em

  placard in his best political-stump-speak-
ing tone read the brief but comprehensive
document valero tried to recover his equi-
librium but the listeners sniffed by this
time they had all heard from the cowboys
about the branding of trenaj calves out in
the way places of range-like the work of
professional maverickers

  valeros statement might go-but his ap-
pearance belied it looking at him and
then at janie frete accused of aiding and
abetting the theft of trenals herd-with
the stalwart if badly wounded snowflake
beside her-if there was any sympathy in
the matter there was no doubt as to where
the sympathy rested

  but the law is law which does not change
with the local waves of public sentiment
however ardent but follows the slow and
deliberate tidal change of general custom
and national habit valero had with his
little slip of paper invoked the law of
the land and if he and his kind had been
sneaking out and branding calves to enrich
the herds of two ranches by impoverishing
th third herd it was his own affair even
though it had involved a whole desert region
in the calamity of a desperado chase and
the running down of a bandit gang-real
bandits apparently

  being bandits the dead burke the dead
tarcass the two half-breeds also dead and
this ghostly snowflake-whoever he was-
their employer janie frete stood among
them all a slender gentle youn woman
hostess of all the men-hunters and their
wounded but the employer of that wild
crew whose exploit was now the wonder
and the mystery of the whole affair

  they had gathered all of irving trenals
herd cut out all the cattie belonging to the
two neighboring ranches and would in an-
other day have carried them out of the
whole range-a clear getaway in spite of
the frantic search that had been inaugurated
when bleak grisp discovered that those cat-
tle were gone bleak was dead he could
not tell what surmise had been in his head
whether he had known that only the trenal
cattle were part of that herd

  despite the slip of paper and its assur-
ance that they had not rounded up as crimi-
nals killing them the employees of an in-
nocent rancher there was a feeling in the
united posse that there was something very
wrong in the whole affair sheriff placard
took the widely experienced railroad man
chief detective artent to one side and dis-
cussed the matter with him as the best
available authority

   leave it to valero put it right up to
him the detective suggested tartly  its
his mess let him clean it or lie in it
accordingly placard went to valero and
put it up to him

   look here valero he said  youre
the complainant in this case being as you
are agent and owner of the white face cat-
tle company and marvelando company
outfits what do you want done with her-
miss frete

   whats your duty in regard to desper-
adoes caught stealing cattle valero turned
on him catching the drift of the sheriffs de-
mand

   mister man placard replied  your
agent bleak grisp summoned me saying
cattle had been stolen you came in and
rode the range hunting them you were
the complainant and you are the plaintiff
and prosecuting witness right now who
do you accuse of stealing your cattle
valero was cornered placard had
brought up several good and reliable wit-
nesses so as to make his own position clear
-valero saw that for a minute he con-
sidered his predicament knowing what he
did seeing the circle of listeners and with
a covert glance toward the bungalow he
controlled his voice and with deliberation
shaking his head up and down to emphasize
his words he said
janie and the waning glories



    accuse this whole damned outfit here
from the woman down of stealing my cat-
tle harboring outlaws and desperadoes and
-and of plotting and doing murder now
sheriff can you ask any more than that

   yes placard said  just write that
all down and make it plain

  valero flinched he cowered before that
final and ultimate clinching of his state-
ment it had been easy to utter the words
but when sheriff placard handed him a
blank page in a note-book his hands shook
so that he could barely force himself in
strained and jagged penmanship to write
the formal information that would bring
into the courts through the sheriffs imme-
diate action the later action of the grand
jury sitting in a criminal case and then the
trial janie frete and the surviving mem-
bers of the outfit which she had gathered
about her in the ranch

  but valero was desperate every step he
had taken had involved him deeper and
deeper and now he fancied he must see it
through accordingly with his fountain pen
he wrote what he already had said and
signed his name to it turning from the
sheriff on his heel with an indignation that
caused the politician to wonder if he had
not been overcareful of his own skin in
treating in that way the owner of many
acres many cattle and holding none knew
how much influence nevertheless the
written accusation cleared the sheriff in
what must prove to be a most difficult situ-
ation

  he went to janie frete and showed her
the statetnent

   you see miss frete he said apolo-
getically  i just got to do it i 

   i see she said like a tired girl  i
suppose so-but those boys didnt mean to
get me into this trouble theyre woitnd-
ed-youll give them the best care well
go in my car-if you wish

  janie turned and looked at the ranch
it was a beautiful place and with all those
posse men with the cattle with screaming
eagl glaring about her defiant and snow-
flake sitting in a half faint on the porch
steps of the bungalow the scene was won-
derful that her truck was already moving
southward along the plain bound to rack-

lack with the dead but made the moment
more dramatic

  those westerners gazed at her with im-
mobile countenances but with the odd light
in their eyes that men have when they find
themselves excusing or even approving the
daring flights of a charming womans imagi-
nation janie had played for a big stake
they all felt and she had lost out by only a
fraction-another night and the three thou-
sand trenal cattle must have been beyond
the mountain gap and the searchers been
satisfied with the scattered animals from
the white face and marvelando ranches

  there was the trenal herd and if they
sympathized with janie they scorned va-
lero they had seen him walk in worn down
by his adventures and they had been wit-
ness to the petty branding of calves out of
the mother cows brands that was a fact
that ownership of the trenal herd could
not wholly explain the cowboys who had
worked with bleak grisp and on the white
face cattle company ranch all knew that
something was wrong

  but none of these things settled their con-
victions so thoroughly as the venom of va-
leros present attitude toward the woman
whatever she was even if she had been
queen of the waning glory break band of
desperadoes not one of the cattle taken
but had the trenal brand-and every one
knew that janie frete had inherited that
ranch subject to the hundred-thousand-dol-
lar mortgage

  valero had told the story and the papers
in the county clerks office told the story
when other land speculators had thought to
take up the ranch in view of the failure of
any heir to appear in person or by at-
torney trust them to know the conditions
covering such a property as trenals a
hundred thousand dollars was not too high
a price to pay for that land

chapter xl

 shes done lit out

it was after all too late to start on that
day for racklack too much had been
done and it would be better to wait over
a night the surgeons agreed for one of the


all-story weekly

wounded men accordingly janie was per-
mitted to return to her position as hostess

   oh mr valero she asked  will you
sell me one of those yearlings my-ah-
house-party is rather an unexpected drain
on my larder

  valero hesitated janie turned on her
heel spoke to chippy who had returned
from carrying the message for the sur-
geons though he knew it meant facing the
music-but with janie

   i forgot-kill one of my own maverick
brands wont you

  valero had claimed all the animals-but
the rustlers had branded for her nearly a
hundred head chippy could not get to a
horse quickly enough every man with a
rope turned to the herd and four animals
were brought out instanter chippy picked
one of these-one of janies own little herd

  there was beef for the guests of the
waning glory ranch and no thanks to the
tar-witted and harassed valero for now it
was said that he wouldnt even let the
woman he was hounding feed the posse that
had saved him two hundred thousand dol-
lars worth of beef and breeder cattle

  valero couldnt understand the feeling of
ostracism that had fallen upon him there
he was chief of all that gathering of ban-
dit hunters-the man most concerned in the
whole affair speaking financially-and they
all were waiting upon the wan smile of the
woman that young woman queen of des-
peradoes and letting him shift for himself

  no one would talk to valero no one
would stand by till he came up to talk on
his own hook and when the beef had been
water cooled and janies indians were bar-
bequeing it with potatoes in a huge scald-
ing kettle and coffee in several pails valero
saw the coming of sunset with a feeling of
dread he had never known before he had
tried to move the cavalcade on to the mar-
velando but the horses were too tired and
his heartlessness toward the wounded
brought another rebuke valero had broken
every rule of etiquette and the sage the
alkali the very mountain ranges rebuked
him

  on the other hand janie frete had with
utmost care preserved her exact decorum
after that little episode with valero who

had offered her an escape for a price she
took her pistol to placard and give it to
him she had shown him the stock of am-
munition and with a little laugh given him
one of the  automatic pistols

   tisnt much sheriff she smiled
 my boys practiced with that kind-had
lots of fun with them wont you borrow it
yourself till i come clear

  placard bit his lip under his heavy mus-
tache he hated this role he was obliged to
play but he accepted the loan and went
around showing the others that pretty little
trick of a gun and when they tried a few
shots with it everybody had to take a
whack and there was a regular shooting
match with the  long-rifle shells

  they even had janie over there to shoot
a few shots and when at ninety feet she
hit a fifty-cent piece with every shot but
one in a clip-in six seconds time-there
was a gasp

   its well you werent riding with your
outfit one remarked and in the rebuking
silence of the men who heard thatcomment
janie replied

   oh-but id been riding if id knowtn
-her voice caught- what my boys were
doing for me you dont think for a min-
ute that i wouldnt have been do you

   she didnt know every man asked
himself  by gad-if she had a known
they went and asked the rather mys-
terious snowflake about that phase of the
matter-confidentially and as man to man
snowflake confirmed it he wouldnt talk
about himself and he refused to admit that
he was one of the old blue mountain and
northern new mexico desperadoes but he
frankly declared that they had all ridden for
janie doing their best for her

   but we were fools snowflake shook
his head  we lowed to save a herd for
her out of the trenal brand pickings she
didnt know a thing about it-well all swear
the same thing if you dont string us up on
general principles after her trial course
we aint no expectations of nothing

   there woni be no necktie party the
sheriff assured him it beats me this
whole blamed business itll take a phila-
delphia lawyer to settle in court

   i want to sit on her jury sheriff  a
janie and the waning glories



 bystander exclaimed  you can fix it you
 know you can 

   placard grinned we got to send to
carson city for talesmen i expect-ac-
 count o bias he said

   night fell and bonfires around which
 men sat talking were flaring between the
 bungalow and fence where the yard was
 valero walking up and down nervously
 found himself desperate in his loneliness

   he met deputy sheriff plickner whom
 he knew well of old him he led away be-
 yond the firelight circles plickner went
 unwillingly but could not reiuse

    look here valero choked  i want
 you to do me a favor understand i cant
 let anybody know-how much i think of
 ihat girl see janie but good god
 man i cant see her in this fix

    mv cars yon side the corral-ive run
 it oer there just tip her off-tanks full
 of gas oil-everythings ready theres a
 thousand dollars in the side pocket plick-
 ner-old boy this is personal-wont
 you give her the word-sos she wont fear
 a bullet cornin you know-women are
 fraid of guns-ill take the blame-

    what eh-sure old boy i knew-
  couldnt believe you hadnt no sense of
 gallantry-that you couldnt help but see
 -i was just feeling thataway myself about
 her why shed never be convicted any
 way 

   so plickner drifted around up and
 down as much as though he hadnt any-
 thing on his mind as could be under the
 circumstances placard had put up to him
 the guarding of the young woman the liv-
 ing members of the outfit including the
 wagon-schooner indians were of course
 now in chains and under guard of riflemen

    say-miss frete  plickner whispered
 to her at an opportune moment  in case
 you dont know the lay of the land that
 fool valeros left his gas wagon around
 yon side the corral theres a thousand dol-
 lars in the right-han side-pocket if youre
 broke

    im just telling you understand 
 got my eye on you every second course
 thats my duty but-well hits night if
 you aint a tenderfoot out here then
 youre so bright it aint no use-lots of gas

an oil an theres a grub stake there too
-hunk of eatin and water-bottles

  she caught his hand in both hers

  you dear big goose she exclaimed
 dont you know-i just couldnt go
away and leave you i am a tenderfoot-
really but i just love you-all of you

   why nine of these dear boys have
been to me already and told me-told me
just what to do and some d go with me
and show me the way too-

   the sons of guns  plickner grumbled
 wrho-itl-

   sfa-h  shfr lowered the voice  even
the under sheriff is a perfectly lovely man
plickner who had daughters older than
janie shook his head at the same time
he felt his enthusiasm grow this young
woman would face the music and he ac-
cused her of staying with the captured
men of her band she didnt try to
deny it

  he went among the bonfires and when
somebody accused him of neglecting to
keep his eye on his prisoner he shrugged
his shoulders saying

   you couldnt make her not face the
music if you dragged her away with
lariatsj 

  thats so she had a hundred
chances- somebody exploded and
stopped in confusion there was a laugh
already every one knew that janie had re-
fused to run away

  tired men rolled up in saddle-blankets
in the barn or bunk-house to sleep horses
fed more or less noisily down in the alfalfa
out on the plains the great herd stirred in
the moonshine while the night-riders cir-
cled about holding them

  valero had said the herd would be cut
in two and half taken to the white face
cattle ranch and half to the marvelando
ranch the question of what to do with
janie fretes little herd had not yet been
settled janie would not try to think of
the matter

  it was a long night and for most of the
men a restful one another great tradition
had been established and men who had
thought the old days were gone forever
from the west were rejoicing to think that
they were witness to this episode partiei-


all-story weekly

pants in this bit of ancient history revived
-not such ancient history at that

  in the morning at the first streak of
false dawn some began to stir out and
fires were built-fires of cedars which had
been dragged down the mountains by men
on horseback towing with lariats dawn
found the men getting breakfasts and
making ready for the long drive to the
marvelando or white face ranches on
their way homeward till after sunrise
there was a hustling and bustling about
and then sheriff placard asked undersher-
iff plickner if miss frete didnt want to be
moving on

   ive just been looking for her plick-
ner replied  pot girl-shes about tired
out i reckon with so much excitement
but ill go an get her

  he went to the bungalow kitchen and
asked one of the breed women there if
miss frete wouldnt come out just a
minute

chapter xli

an hour for trenal

when janie had seen her three score
or so guests well fed and taken
care of and when she and the in-
dian camp-women had cleared up the
kitchen and put the things in their proper
places she looked in on the wounded men
in the emergency hospital established in
her bungalow a surgeon was there on
watch with screaming eagle who was to
this young graduate a most astonishing ex-

perience taunting him with her own scien-
tific attainments while interjecting the
casuals of indian camp experience

  janie smiling turned from them and
knowing that all was now well according
to her cares as hostess she retreated from
the camp as it grew silent and in her own
room sat down to think

  out of her adventure she had come to
this across the years would fly the evil
of her girlhood and whatever sympathy
she might have now as a weak and tor-
mented woman her past must rise to tor-
ment her she was too tired to discover
any hope for herself in the affair but dis-
mal as were the accumulating circum-
stances she was jubilant when she thought
that those wild and selfish desperadoes had
out of sheer effort to help her performed
a feat that every man in the posse admired
merely as a bit of cattle-country work

  every one had said it was marvelous-
cutting up three herds of cattle cutting
out the trenal brands and rounding them
up miles back in the tumbled lands of the
waning glory breaks to run them off
north to the shipping points

   in another day theyd got away with
them hard luck a cowboy had said
succinctly

  it wasnt the loss of the chance at a for-
tune that broke janies spirit that night
her spirit wasnt broken in fact she was
just sick at heart as she thought the men
killed the men wounded and now the
men brought to chains - just when they
had in all unselfishness for sheer love of
helping a tenderfoot girl establish herself
on a ranch they had performed those feats
of skill of daring and finally of aban-
doned courage

  oh this west she whispered
 what can one do with men like these

  there they were desperadoes and posse
riders professional men-hunters and ranch-
ers cowmen and townsmen breaking from
the routine of habit of the crowd to
go rough riding across deserts and madly
up and down mountains for sheer love of
adventure excitement and performing im-
possible feats as a matter of course

  among them all there was one valero-
poor benighted and helpless man lost to
janie and the waning glories



the whole spirit of what must have been a
sheer game and play but for his presence
janie felt sorry for him and laughed with
tears in her eyes as she discovered in her
mind the fact that after all he had been
the first to propose that she escape from
her predicament under his wing

  following him had come others old
men youths cowboys and sheriffs men-
all kinds had proposed that she escape
with their help or somehow that was a
revelation

  janie tried to sleep caught a cat-nap
awakened and in a half-dream half-mem-
ory saw the figure of irving trenal stand-
ing over his chemical apparatus but it
was in the semi-cave up the mountain
she sat up and thought about it

   i may not return for years-perhaps
never she mused and a longing came to
her heart to see that cave again where a
man had worked between thoughts of love
of her she wished when she slipped out
of the room through the still bungalow
out into the night that trenal might some-
how look down from wherever he dwelt
now and see that on his memory she was
putting another hour of respect for sake of
friendship

   oh trenal she whispered  it was
because we were such good friends that i
was drawn out here-just to be where you
were for a little while

  she walked through the silent bivouac
called up her mountain-climbing pony put
on the bridle and rode away she wasnt
trying to be secretive about it she didnt
even think that this was irregular in a wo-
man prisoner in fact she saw several men
sit up and look at her-without a word
from their moonlighted shelters

  afterward however she did think of it
-what must they have thought seeing her
going away at that hour under those cir-
cumstances not one told the sheriff and
plickner what he had seen

  janie circled around and up the moun-
tainside the pony carrying her in and out
until they arrived at the little stall in the
rocky face she pulled down an armful
of alfalfa saw to it that the little spring-
fed trough was clean and then entered the
cave-studio-laboratory

  moonlight shone in enough to light her
thoughts she disturbed nothing changed
nothing about she just sat down at the
table and with her hands clasped looked
into the past

  she had so many things to remember
so many beautiful ideas-so many accom-
plishments to her credit-so pleasant a life
to recollect there had been other jeop-
ardies and other days when she had found
nights without rest because she was too
tired

  opening the window and parting the
loose trellis she looked down upon the
moonlighted ranch and the cattle spread
over the plain beyond she could hear the
night herders sing-songing and see them
on the outskirts of the bedded-down herd

  she heard a coyote howling she heard
owls around about in the cedars she
heard the faint desert music-she heard
voices-and more music-more voices-
and then peace in her soul at last rested
in heart enough to sleep she put her hand
upon her elbow and with a sigh left the
dreamland of her life for the dreamland of
slumbers

  the hot light from over the sunrise
range awakened her at last she started
up surprised she looked down on the
great herd of cattle which was already in
motion having been watered in the marsh
and well fed

  streaming out from the ranch was the
cavalcade the ambulance carrying the
wounded the indian schooner-wagon with
four horses the automobile truck-as
though the ranch were being deserted

  but theyre leaving me she ex-
claimed  thats the sheriff and valero
in his car why-ah

  janie looked at her wrist-watch the
sun was more than two hours high the
cavalcade the sheriff and his posse were
all going on-leaving her

  they didnt want her they were glad
she had gone they-oh those dear lawless
boys they were happy she could hear
their laughter and shouts as they romped
along the rear and sides of the herd merry-
making

   oh ill overtake them she smiled but
with cheeks aglow and eyes brightening


all-story weekly

she looked at the books the papers the
laboratory of irving trenal

  dreaming among those things she had
enjoyed many happy ranch days and if
trenal was dead and still remembered her
he must now understand the feeling that
she had toward him-not love certainly
but something that was akin to fellowship
understanding of his own enjoyment of that
eery nest and not afraid to ride forth to
die terribly where for a long time perhaps
forever his bones must be scattered by the
wild creatures

  janie could understand a man who had
died thus and she knew that at the mo-
ment of his supreme agony torn by a
bullet trenal had nevertheless superbly
held his soul in leash while his own pistol-
hand found its final service to do killing
the wretched bushwhacker by unflinching
skill

  a thought entered janies mind here
might be hidden the solution of the mystery
she felt and all those men felt regarding
the trenal ranch herd it occurred to her
that a careful systematic search in those
books and papers would disclose the truth
either confirming all of valeros remarkable
but piausible claims-or leaving him un-
masked for the scoundrel janie knew him
to be regardless of any mere business deals
he might have accomplished

   no janie shook her head with the
odd fatality that sometimes guided her at a
supreme moment  no ill not disturb
them any more

   she backed out of the laboratory as from
some sacred mountain-temple slowly
noiselessly with faith she closed and locked
the door then she hung the key on the
lock

   perhaps somebody worthy will come to
love you trenal she whispered into the
crack

  her emotion janies glorious emotion
filled her eyes as she mounted her pony
to ride back down the mountain through
the hidden trail in the gullies and gulches
and among the trees down to the foot-
hills

  then she rode around the bungalow and
looked over the scene-it was all desert
now the indian camp was broken the

bungalow doors closed the bars up to the
alfalfa fence and the bars down at the
corral she felt the chill of abandonment
over the scene and then guiding her pony
up the trail set off at a brisk trot in pursuit
of the cavalcade which was now nearly
twenty miles distant in the dust of alkali
and dancing in the mirage of the plain of
thirsty creek valley

  she let her mount into a gallop not too
swift and at intervals she looked back and
her eyes sought the almost wholly indistin-
guishable fleck away up on the face of
the waning glories where she had that
morning found a peace of soul denied her
for many a day she waved her hand and
she saw the whole mountain-face flicker
and tremble all alight with the bright sun-
shine

  rather sternly she looked ahead into her
pathway she could see many miles clear
way of a pair of ruts in the sage and alkali
where cars had worn them hoof-prints of
cattle and horsemen were flying beneath
her as she pounded along her spirit meas-
uring the glory of that day as though it
might be long before she would have such
freedom again she thought

   whatever mistakes i make ill face
their consequences she said in so many
words  even my mistakes of ignorance
and lack of experience just think i came
into all this without the least inkling of
what i was falling into oh but im not
sorry those poor dear boys and then-
then even theyd let me go if i would-

  she laughed aloud with delight as she
added

   if  only would how theyd like to
be rid of me-if they could

chapter xlh

victory

so janie rode on into the custody of
sheriff placard and that mob of posse-
men she rode up behind them and
of course she was discovered when she was
within two miles or so and the word was
passed up and down as she drew within
recognizable distance there was a yell the
involuntary whoop of men when they see
janie and the waning glories



some one coming to face the music regard-
less of consequences

  at the same time when she rode up
through the crowd to where placard was
leading the way slowly in valeros car
keeping company with the enjoyable crowd
she heard men swearing

   what the blank-blanks she here for-
why didnt she stay gone

  placard told valero to stop the car when
he saw what was coming he didnt look
particularly pleased when he looked at her
but before he could think of anything to
say she stopped beside the car

   well i think sheriff placard that of
all the escorts i ever heard of-the idea
going away and leaving me-me

   thats right jes so a whoop from
near by chimed in

  placard started to apologize and then
janie laughed at him-and so did every
one

   if you dont make me she added to
his complete discomfiture  i shant ride
with you

  accordingly she dropped back among the
horsemen and her guards were four deep
around her all the rest of the way to the
marvelando ranch where the ambulance
had stopped and where there was a liv-
ery car from greengrass awaiting their ar-
rival

  harben tarkley an attorney from chi-
cago had arrived

   sheriff placard he greeted the com-
mander of the cavalcade  i dont know
just what the circumstances are here but
i believe-so the newspapers and my infor-
mation say-you have been seeking des-
peradoes and have captured them now
-ah-according to all accounts my client
-miss janie frete-

   you have a client-miss janie frete
janie rode up to inquire

   you-ah-you are miss frete
  u if im your client you should-

   certainly he retorted promptly  i
should have known long since it is quite
through no fault of my own  assure you
but irve-irving trenal-we studied to-
gether and naturally-

   janie flushed a little

   i do need you-an attorney you see

im under arrest now and mr placard here
the sheriff will tell you and mr valero
that man will corroborate him that i am
a cattle-rustler and queen of the waning
glory breaks bandits and oh i cant
begin to tell you how bad i am

   eh tarkley gasped  queen yes
yes i understand that but of the-ah-
what bandits

   waning glory range

   i declare he looked at her and
looking around at the assemblage  and
these are-ah-the bandits some queen
indeed 

  no need to tell that man where the trail
was leading valero was crouching staring
with unblinking eyes sheriff placard was
flushed crimson with embarrassment all
hands were shouting with joy that they
should be included in janie fretes entour-
age-even of bandits somehow they just
couldnt keep down the questionable hilarity
of the occasion

  the herd of cattle away out on the
plain was raising dust in the approach
of sunset they could not come as fast as
the horsemen of course tarkley saw and
recognized them he turned to janie who
had dismounted

   yes you are my client he said  ir-
ving trenal established my guardianship
over your property inherited from him
under the terms of his will i stopped at
racklack and examined some documents
there whats all this stuff about a hundred
thousand dollars mortgage on his ranch
anyhow and where are your cattle-the
horned-a brand

   my cattle janie asked while a
breathless silence fell ujon the spectators
and audience

   trenal never wrote me i didnt even
know he had been killed till i read an ac-
count of this affair in a chicago paper
monday-tuesday-i forget which of
course i just caught the first train and came
to find out what was up that mortgage
filed at racklack is a forgery a rank
forgery trenal never used that signature
its a clumsy copy of his letter signature
 his business signature was his name in
full his middle name-clarence  think
from what i heard at racklack you de-


all-story weekly

cidedly do need an attorney to look after
your affairs

  what-wha- valero trembled as he
half rose to his feet in the automobile cry-
ing  she-she made -she accepted the
debt its legal she accepted the debt
she made a payment on it-the-the mort-
gage 

  oh youre it she made a payment
eh tarkley fnquired softly

   yes sir she paid us-mrs forelane
and me she admitted the debt

   thats true tarkley turned to ja-
nie for confirmation

   yes janie replied

   thats fine tarkley said heartily
 fine that completes the grand larceny
grab him

  there were no lack of hands to seize
valero as he jumped two rawhide ropes
in fact fell open him rather roughly and
with opposing directions to their hauling
taut valero was stretched out on the
ground as unceremoniously as a calf about
to be branded and lying there perfectly
helpless he cried choking and gasping also
like a calf as was remarked

   and my boys janie turned to tark-
ley first of all  my boys-the men i
hired who rounded up the horned-a
cattle

   oh-their work for you thats all
right

   tarcass burke-theyre dead janie
whispered  but the others-they claim
you know desperadoes

    well see tarkley promised  whos
that other-

  valero disheveled and triced up now
quailed under his glance whatever had
happened janie was absolved now if not
legally at least she would be

  valero was the cattle-thief having forged
to get a claim and then enlisted the very
government to steal the cattle from the real
owner whoae outfit had sought to save to
her what was rightfully hers that at
least the region could understand and the
men of the posse went around to shake
hands with snowflake and chippy and the
others

   you boys had the right idea they were
told  that scoundrel valero had us

plumb locoed with his papers and legal

fixings

  when the matters pertaining to irving
trenals estate had all been straightened out
by his friend and executor harben tark-
ley there still remained the question of
what to do with tremaine valero and
uintah forelane

  racklack had been rather glad to wel-
come these two at the county jail where
they were about the most distinguished
prisoners ever lodged there the prose-
cuting attorney left tbe matter in janies
hands janie was without bitterness she
had suffered too much from bitterness in
the hearts of other people-avarice and
passion and other demonstrations-to re-
gard them with a thirst for vengeance

   but mr tarkley she said  i do
want justice it isnt because i am mean
there lie against my name stains im will-
ing to suffer for my own sins and indiscre-
tions but-

the two men looked at her she bad
difficulty in continuing her thought aloud

it had to be done however

   that woman obtained her divorce by
accusing me and her husband it was false
no man ever treated me better-nor her
either but those papers those affidavits-
all lies procured lies by hired witnesses
by her own perjury too oh i could tear
her limb from limb for that shame she
falselv inflicted upon me

   you think-

   that i shall prosecute this thing to the
limit if she does not before all the world
confess to her infamous attack on my char-
acter i dont care about the mortgage-nor
the rest but that-

   i see the attorneys said in unison

  they would have brought uintah before
them as a tribunal but janie said she
wouldnt permit it

    dont want to see her i never want
to see her janie declared  i never shall
see her willingly except when i have to
testify in court to what i have suffered at
her hands

    but ill lie fair ill say too that i love 
this country and its people and ill thank
her and valero for bringing me out here
janie and the waning glories

the way they did though it was to swindle
me yet i-oh you know i just love those
men-placard and the posse and all of
them and my own lovely desperadoes too
most of all those bad boys

  for a minute her face was alight with
that fine background

   shed eat a mile of rawhide that wo-
man said the prosecuting attorney  just
to keep out of jail theyre broke both of
them they owed about everybody and
theres such a rush of foreclosing and in-
junctions on bank accounts and that kind
of things that theyre stripped down to
their black hearts

   well see tarkley said

  to tell the truth uintah forelane hesi-
tated at this last humiliation and atone-
ment then abjectly she cleared the name
of the woman she had twice wronged and
when the divorce case wras thus reopened
she found herself no longer a divorcee but
married to forelane

  poverty-stricken now and miserably
heartsick she realized what she had brought
upon herself her only resource-what she
must become if-if there was no answer to
the telegram she must send arliss forelane
into her message accordingly she wrote
the terror and humbleness of her confession
and pleading

  arliss can you understand and forgive i am
down in the dirt if you could-oh arliss

  that and more than that hysterical in
its fears but sincere in her misery fore-
lane sent one word that revealed the heart
unswerving in its unwilling and even hope-
lessly indignant love

coming ariiss

  janie transported from determination to
endure without complaint what might come
to sheer freedom and enjoyment of a great
regions glories and humans asked but
little of her new-found friends

   sure they cried  take em back on
your ranch and if you just keep em behav-
ing theirselves and rounding up your own
cattle nothing  be said we dont care

the

about wthat they did away off yonder its
what theyre going to do thatd bother us

   and say-snowflake hes the best
da-best man for cattle anywrhere if he
hadnt happened to kill his boss over in
the little rockies in self-defense and got a
lot of influential citizens down on him hed
be the best cowboy ever but that sent him
long-riding and if theres anybody else-
course youve got to make em behave
theirselves

   oh they will she cried  i know
they will and even sugar

   sugar whos he

   i dont know-just sugar if he didnt
get-

   was he the one that bull-frogged the
long-horn steer and got away

   was he snowflake she turned to the
limping man still on his feet not having
lost a day despite almost killing bullet
wounds

   yes

   hed come back hed behave him-
self she asked

   would he snowflake blinked his
eyes  would he the only time that
boy ever did git sentimental-one time yo
remember he said he never did have a
chance

   oh yes i do remember send quick
send him word wont you tell him hes
got a chance now

  you bet  snowflake turned so quickly
that his hurts made him see stars and with
a lift of his arm that almost made him faint
he called  hey chippy come ere
chippy in janies camping-car started
down racklacks main street with the dust
climbing faster behind the wheels as his
speed increased the crowd that had come
to the celebrated court-week divining the
situation stood on their tiptoes and as one
man yelled

   go it bringim in

  so janie knew that the guide wrho had
lost the marvelando outfit away back at
pilot peak who was suspected of breaking
up sheriff placards charge on the cattle
herd and killing bleak grisp was also
forgiven and would become one of her new
oufit-renewed so to speak
end
his name was rudolph-rudolph
van rennselaer-and when the
chief had handed me my cue and
id chalked up and got into rudolphs
game it didnt take me long to find out that
rudolph was playing right up to form he
was in dutch-all over

  yes sir rudolph surely had his troubles
and before long i had mine and what ive
got to say is all about those troubles of
rudolphs- and mine-and nothing else
when ive finished with those im through
-the same as i am with rudolph that
will be all

  still i know that if  ring off without
going on record as to whether or not ru-
dolph made good there  certainly be a
howl from somewhere and so for the bene-
fit of the bunch from missouri i may as
well state right at the start off that - he
did rudolph made good-big

  more than that hes still coming through
strong and  dont know of any reason why
he shouldnt keep the good work right up
for some time to come-unless he gets to
feeling like he simply had to oblige some-
body if rudolph ever gets that way again
i wont be responsible for the results and
whats more somebody else can handle the
situation-somebody besides me and i
take this opportunity to wish them all kinds
of joy as for me-enough is enough

  the chief sent me out to bring in ru-
dolph dead or alive and thatwas the way
i brought him in dead or alive-i didnt

know which i dont mean rudolph i
mean me physically you understand i
dont ask any odds of anybody but when
i get worried i get nervous and when i get
nervous i generally get real good and ner-
vous and then-

  but anyhow i went and did what the
chief told me to i brought in rudolph
as soon as we hit town i took rudolph by
the hand and led him to the hotel where
i knew the team was stopping there were
a few other little details but we wont
bother with em you can fill em in for
yourself later on

  the desk clerk said the chief was in his
room we went up and crashed in on
the chief and i made him acquainted with
mr rudolph van rennselaer the chief
said he was glad to meet rudolph and
believe me i was glad to have the chief meet
him because it meant that my responsibility
ceased right there and then rudolph said
he was glad to meet the chief and so that
made three of us

  well the chief punched the bag a while
with mr van rennselaer and then he
asked him

   how about it feel like working to-
morrow

   sure says rudolph  if you want me
to

   anything to oblige says i

  pretty soon after that the chief managed
to get it past the bone that if rudolph really
felt like tearing himself away from us and


anything to oblige



going to his room or anything there
wouldnt be any hard feelings and ru-
dolph obliged

  soon as rudolph had pulled his fade-out
the chief says to me

   well joe i see you put it over

   yeh says i  i did that and now
if its all the same to you john id kinda
like a little vacation or something i feel
all sorta worn out and nervous i need a
rest

   why now that you speak of it says
the chief  you do look kinda bad joe

   youre a wonderful observer says i
 youve got a great pair of eyes most
people wouldnt notice it

  just before that while the chief and ru-
dolph were gassing back and forth id lined
up in front of the mirror in the chiefs
room and heres what i saw there were
big black circles an inch deep underneath
my eyes and if i passed a man on the street
that had the same kind of look in his eyes
that i had id tell the first cop i met that
id seen a loose nut a little ways back
and hed better get busy before there was a
murder or something my cheeks were all
sort of hollowed out and caved in and i
needed a shave my hair was all mussed up
every which ways and when i tried to
smooth it out my hand shimmied so that
all i did was to muss it up worse i had
on a bow tie which is generally worn hor-
izontal by the best dressers but mine was
perpendicular

  yes sir i says to the chief  you cer-
tainly are a great hand for noticing little
things no doubt if you went to the circus
youd notice the elephant before you ran
into it and it threw you for a goal

   what happened asked the chief

   ill tell you says i  but before we
go into that take a little tip from me dont
take any stock in what that big dutch
cheese told you about his feeling all right
to go in there and pitch to-morrow make
him show you something first he only
said it to oblige you

   how do you mean the chief asked
me

   i mean what i say i told him  he
only said it to oblige you if hed had
neuritis in both arms and a felon on every

finger hed a said the same thing any-
thing to oblige any thing

   listen chief im going to tell you
something if this bird rudolph van rcnn-
selaer had one glass eye and one that was
natural and you came along and asked him
for an eye without specifying hed give
you the good one thats how obliging he
is the most obliging person on earth bar
none ill say he is-and ive got my rea-
sons

   why john there aint any lengths that
that fellow wouldnt go to for a body and
so thoughtful of the feelings of others
youd be surprised why-

  if you know anthing the chief cut
in on me  lets hear it lets get to-
gether

  so tiien i told him

  in a way it was a case of get results or
get out if it hadnt been you can lay a
bet that i wouldnt have gone and mixed
into one of those affairs of the heart as
they call em the way i did not that it
was any affair of mine-and that goes both
ways as a general rule if a couple of
people want to have one of those affairs of
the heart i consider its nobodys funeral
but their own and it usually works out that
way-nine times out of ten im right

  but here was a situation where it was
strictly up to me to come through or hunt
a job you understand no doubt that
my job was ivory-hunting for the pink sox
and when i refer to the chief i mean mr
john mcgowan the teams celebrated man-
ager well just recently the chief had sent
me out on a couple of bone-hunting expe-
ditions and id fallen down on the job-
both of em

  i wont go into the details but ill say
that of course it wasnt through any fault
of mine im just an ordinary human be-
ing and miracles are out of my line

  but that didnt make any difference
you know there are times when people
dont stop to make allowances-such as
when theres some kind of a big jam on
and its a case of do something or go under
-and this was one of those times as a
pennant possibility the pink sox were go-
ing into the discard-and going fast-just
for want of a good reliable southpawr


all-story weekly

  we simply had to dig up a regular big-
league left-handed pitcher from somewhere
or watch the worlds series from the grd
stand now both of those trips that id
taken were for the purpose of filling this
hole in the pink sox line-up and id come
home without the bacon

  and when shortly afterward the chief
got wind of this fellow rudolph van
rennselaer he put it up to me in language
that most any child could understand

   ive got the lowdovvn on this man van
rennselaer says the chief  and you dont
have to worry about whether hes good or
not ill take my chances on that all
youve got to do is sign him thats all
bring him in

   and joe if you dont-well ill do
what i can for you but you know how the
owners feel about the way you booted the
chance of grabbing those two other left-
handers and so if i were you i wouldnt
rely a whole lot on my pulling you th rough
if you dont deliver im sorry joe but
thats the way it is do vou follow me
joe

   im right on top of you chief says i

  and i certainly was it was straight up
to me to talk or lose the wire that was
all there was to it

   all right joe says the chief  good-
by take care of yourself and-good luck

  thanks says i  farewell chief-it
may be for days or it may be forever

  at a guess there are about five thousand
people in the world that have ever heard
of lymanville pennsylvania theyre the
people that live there of course its a long
shot but if it does happen that youre one
of the others i wont try to prove it to you
-lymanville youll have to take it for
granted thats the way i did when i
started for there i took it for granted and
when i started away from there i took it
on the jump

  anyway i reached lymanville along late
in the afternoon all the dope i had on
this boy-wonder rudolph van rennselaer
was that he was pitching for lymanville
in the three-b league-bones boots and
brawls i guess of course in the end id
have to do business with the manager of
the lymanville outfit but i thought first

id have a little heart-to-heart talk witk
rudolph after that wed see-and we
did

  another thing id learned from experi-
ence that in the tusk-hunting business it
doesnt pay to advertise so when i regis-
tered at the hotel i sort of handed out the
idea that i was selling plows or flivvers
or some other kind of agricultural imple-
ment and then without tipping off my
hand i managed to find out where id prob-
ably find rudolph

  rudolph i learned w-as living at a board-
ing-house run by a mrs platt when i
rang the door-bell mrs platt i guessed it
was came to the door and when i asked
for mr van rennselaer she said she
thought he was out in the back yard in the
hammock

  maybe i didnt say that we were having
a regular hot spell and somehow i dont
seem to stand those hot spells as well as i
used to i guess that was one of the rea-
sons why-

  but anyhow mrs platt had the right
idea i found rudolph in the back yard
every inch of him depending on the ham-
mock for support and dead to the world i
always envy these fellows the sort that
seemingly havent got a thing in the world
to worry em and that can sit down or lie
down most anywiiere and pass away in a
second it would seem like as for me being
a married man and all and what with one
thing and another to worry me im lucky
to get six hours sleep a night to say noth-
ing of sleeping between sleeps

  well when i shook rudolph out of it he
showed right away that the old brain was
right in there working just as smooth and
easy as oil-and quick too quick as a
flash he said that he guessed he must have
been asleep

  i told him that id certainly hate to get
into a guessing contest with him and then
i introduced myself i told him by name
and said i was scouting for the pink sox

  joe lathrop says he the old
white sox backstop i-i remember hear-
ing about you

   thanks rudolph says i  when
youve been off the billboards a while every
little bit helps but getting down to busi-
anything to oblige



ness you havent got a fountain pen handy
have you

   what for he asked

   youre going to sign out with the pink
sox says i just as if  meant it which
i did  and i forgot and left mine home
the pink sox says rudolph

   you heard me says i

   me pitch for the pink sox he says
as if he couldnt believe his ears

   well says i  thats the intention
anyway of course-r-

  oh gee he wailed  can you beat
it aint that just my luck

   whats the matter now i fired at him
beginning to feel a sort of slipping feeling

   i cant he groaned throwing up his
hands like as if to say  all is lost  or
something like that im all sewed up
i looked at him at first glance youi
put rudolph down for nothing but an over-
grown boy-a big kid and youd be right
and wrong he was big all right enough
but the only reason he was a kid was be-
cause hed always be one no doubt you
get the idea rudolph was one of the sort
that never grow up you know the kind
well anyhow when i took that good look
at rudolph i placed him at twenty-five
and missed by a year he was twrenty-six i
found out later but the rest of my guesses
were better

  i sized him up as being one of these
good-natured easy-going sort of fellows
and on top of that the sort of bird that
doesnt know his own mind once in a coons
age and sort of irresponsible to boot thats
it sort of irresponsible and they were all
dead-center shots events proved that i
surely had rudolph right

   what do you mean all sswed up i
fired at him  do you mean youve signed
up with some other club in the big show
 no says he-and i felt better  but
-i-i- he started again and stopped
and id a taken my oath he was blushing

  come through with it you big goof
i barked  whats ailing you

   i-im gonna be married says he as
coy as a sixteen-year-old girl

  i laughed

   well dont let that worry you ru-
dolph says   you know theres lots

    	a-s

of married men in the big leagues-honest
there is fact is the married men make
the best players or as you might say its
the women theyre married to that make
the best players-if you were looking for
die explanation

   a married man has some sense of re-
sponsibility you bet he has anyway
marriage aint any bar to service in the big
show nobody  think a bit the less of
you for it its done right along when
are you due to step off

   day after to-morrow says he

   well says i   was hoping we could
get away to-morrow but-thats all right
well take the bride right along with us
and-

   not a chance he mourned  no more
chance than a rabbit prunella aint got
any use for baseball and she said id have
to give it up and so ive got to

   besides-you know ive been pulling
down pretty good money pitching for ly-
manville-weve got our wedding-trip all
planned out going to niagara falls and
then up into canada and around and
prunellas got her mind set on it and-it
wouldnt be right i couldnt think of dis-
appointing her so you see-

   say says i  i thought you were
pitching baseball for lymanville is that
the custom in the three-b league-to al-
low a player a month or so off for a honey-
moon right in the middle of the season

   there aint any three-b league ru-
dolph informed me  she blew up last
week and the boss paid us off and gave
us our releases and-

   then youre a free agent i says

   well says he  i would be if it wasnt
for prunella

   i guess youve said it said i  strikes
me that prunella is the center of this par-
ticular disturbance as you might say but
rudolph im going to tell you something
maybe youve got an idea that you aint
going to sign out with the pink sox if
you have youre wrong get that idea right
out of your head you are

   theres several reasons why youre go-
ing to hire out to the pink sox and the best
one is because im a married man and i
cant afford to lose my job do you get


all-story weekly

me rudolph something tells me that
prunella or no prunella youre going to
sign on the dotted line and right away
afterward youre going on a journey with a
short dark good-looking man which is me
now you just listen 

  and with that i tore into him i had
a lot of good arguments and i fed em to
him one by one straight from the shoulder
yes sir i surely talked turkey to rudolph
here was his chance in the big show i told
him-his chance to reach out and grab
fame coin everything and he was throwing
it away just to suit the mere whim of-of
prunella

  where was his sand i asked him all
he had to do was show a little determination
and no doubt prunella would soon come
around to a more sensible view of things
for that matter-but never mind ill sim-
ply say this when  finished i was right
where i started

   i know says rudolph  its all so
and-and id give a leg just to pitch one
game for the pink sox but there aint
any use prunellas got everything all
planned out and-i couldnt think of dis-
appointing her

   anything to oblige eh says i

   i guess thats it says he

  and if you ever saw a man look helpless
and hopeless it was rudolph

   rudolph i asked him  are you keep-
ing something from me

   why no says he as innocent as a
lamb  what would i be keeping from
you

   search me says i and-well i
thought a minute and then i said  well
rudolph i guess that  be all for now
but dont think for one minute that i aint
coming back i am ill see you again
sometime to-morrow and listen keep
all this under your hat dont tell anybody
who i am or why im here is that clear
 all right says rudolph

   by the way says i  whats her last
name

   fitch says he

   thanks i says and left him

  as i turned the corner of the house i
happened to look back and unless i was
all wrong rudolph was asleep again

  well i certainly felt tired and pretty well
discouraged too to say the least i went
back to the hotel lay down on my bed for
a little rest then went through the motions
of eating a little something-and all this
while i was thinking and the more i
thought the less it got me

  any way i looked at it seemed to me
 was squarely up against it no light any-
where it was a tough old world and thats
all there was to it finally i got desperate
and sent off a wire to the chief

  for the love of mike what will i do this
big turnip van rennselaer is all dated up to get
married day after to-morrow and then theyre
going to escape to canada for a month and the
girl says hes got to lay off baseball anyway and
wild horses cant do a thing with him and so
what chance have i got what do you think
i am a miracle man answer at once and let
we know whether this lets me out

  i sent that off to the chief and then i
tried to put the whole thing out of my
mind until to-morrow and it was just as
easy as forgetting an ulcerated tooth or for
the rent-collector to forget to come around

  next morning i stuck around the hotel till
the answer came from the chief it said

  join team to-morrow in philadelphia bring
van rennselaer with you

  the way i acted after i read that i guess
people must have thought i was crazy
maybe i was anyway right away after-
ward i sent off another wire to the chief
this one said-

  have man ready to start for lymanville with
cash bail when you hear from me

  of course i didnt know just exactly
what i was going to do but judging from
the things that i felt capable of doing
seemed to me like it might be a good scheme
to be prepared for the worst

  then i asked the desk clerk if hed be
kind enough to tell me where the residence
of mr fitch might be and he said hed do
better than that and tell me just exactly
where it was and he did it and so then
i started for mr fitchs place

  the idea had hit me during the night
id drop in on rudolphs bride-to-be and
anything to oblige



see if i couldnt get her to listen to reason
myself  if rudolph made good in the big
league it would mean a lot of coin and-
well anyway id try it no harm trying
anyhow and who knows maybe-

  but anyway a big strapping fierce-
looking bird came to the door and  guessed
it was mr fitch-anyway he certainly
looked and acted as if he was the works
round about there he looked like hed be
a pretty tough customer to buck up against
too in fact if it was all the same to mr
fitch he and  would have very little to
do with each other

   mr fitch i asked him

  he admitted it and wanted to know what
he could do for me

   is miss fitch at home i asked him

   which one says he

  seemingly there was more than one miss
fitch-and to save my life just then i
couldnt seem to remember the name of ru-
dolphs miss fitch all i could remember
was that it began with some kind of fruit

   funny says i  but i cant seem to
recollect what daughters have you

   well says he  theres geraldine and
maude and alice and louise and may
and-did i mention maude

   yeh says i  you mentioned her
 and florence he went on  and pru-
nella and-

   never mind the rest  says  pru-
nella wins could i be allowed to see miss
prunella

   whats your business he inquired
now i wasnt sure that i had any busi-
ness with prunella and i was getting less
certain of it all the time-anyway i wanted
to get a look at prunella first and then id
act accordingly-and besides i had a no-
tion that if i came right out with it and
stated my real business with prunella mr
fitch might think i was presuming on such
slight acquaintance or something and may-
be he wouldnt like it and i didnt want
to do anything that mr fitch wouldnt like
and so

   why says i  you see its like this
im-well-you see im on the road for a-
for a big new york furniture house
household furnishings and-household fur-
nishings-and-well-stuff like that-see

i aint got any samples with me because -
well beds and davenports and those sort of
things are kinda unhandy to carry around

   understand me but i happened to
hear that miss prunella was going to be
married and no doubt theyre going to set
up housekeeping and so i thought id call
on her and see if theyve made arrangements
about buying their furniture and if they
havent-well ive certainly got a mighty
attractive proposition and id like to put it
up to her

  ive always felt pretty proud of that it
was good

   come in says mr fitch i made
good  step into the parlor says he and
pointed the way i stepped then he left
me and  heard him yelling for prunella

  i didnt have to wait long prunella
came and as she crossed the threshold a
thought crossed my mind id just as soon
take one on the chin from a heavyweight
champ as i would from miss prunella fitch
youd never know the difference

  she shaded six feet by an inch had large
capable hands and feet a face like a pirate
chief and determination stuck out of her in
more places than quills stick out of a por-
cupine she was a regular woolworth
among women prunella was and like all
other imposing modern edifices of concrete-
and-steel construction-all the way

  i rose to salute-and never felt more like
it in my life

   miss fitch says i

   certainly she snapped

  to be sure says i  well miss
fitch on second thought i wont detain
you i came here to talk furniture but i
find that ive left my catalogues at the
hotel and i cant do business without em
and so-maybe i can find time to call again
but i doubt it in fact im sure of it 

   this way out says she

  i went away from there

  and i went straight to rudolph this
time i found him in his room at mrs
platts

   rudolph i greeted him  ive got the
goods on you

   how do you mean he asked

   im wise to the whole situation i told
him  ive called on the bride and i know


all-story weekly

whats happened seeing is believing you
dont want to marry this fitch dame you
know you dont

   youve been buffaloed into this mar-
riage and you havent got gumption enough
to try and save yourself-though i dont
know as i blame you considering what
youre up against having seen father and
prunella and no doubt the rest of the
family are to be reckoned with too aint
it the truth

   well yes he admitted  i guess
thats the straight of it

   i thought so says i  all right
come on lets go

   where asked rudolph

   away from lymanville says   on
to the big league snap out of it show
your sand you big jelly-fish lets beat
it

  just for an instant it seemed like i had
him going but-no

  he shook his head  its no use he
says  i couldnt think of disappointing
prunella i wouldnt want to do anything
to disoblige her like that shes got her
mind set on-

  for two cents i would have killed him
and gone to the chair with a smile

   all right helpless i ground out at him
 well see whether you will or not what
times the wedding to-morrow

  he told me ten oclock

   ten i says  very well now get
this some time between now and ten
oclock to-morrow youre going to leave this
village youre going far away and you re
never coming back compared to you a
rabbit is a fighting fool and theres more
nerve in half an inch of yellow dog than
youve got in j-our whole blamed frame

   rut that dont make any difference
im here to save you-and my job-and
im going to do it im going to set some-
thing off under you-i dont know what
but something-and youre going to start
running and keep right on at it till this burg
and prunella and all aint anything but just
a memory

   do you get me rudolph youre leav-
ing here before ten to-morrow thats just
as sure as god made little apples-if i have
to use chloroform

  well it was just like i said it was i
didnt have the ghost of an idea of what i
was going to do but i was going to do
something  had to i went back to the
hotel locked myself in my room and went
to it i never came up for air until nine
oclock that night then i had a bite to
eat went for a little walk-lymanville by
moonlight-and then went at it again

  it was during this time and afterward
that i picked up those inch-deep chocolate
circles under my eyes and all the rest of it
but never mind all that i wont go into
the thousand-and-one hare-brained schemes
that i dug up from somewhere fooled with
a while and then chucked into the discard
ill simply say this at half past eight the
next morning-one hour and a half to go -
when it seemed like i could feel the old
brain rattling round inside my dome like
a dried pea in a pod-all of a sudden it
came

  less than half an hour later a large high-
powered motor-car stopped in front of mrs
platts boarding-house in lymanville penn-
sylvania i stepped out of it told the driver
to keep the engine running and shortly
afterward i crashed in on rudolph

  rudolphs bridal clothes were draped all
over the place and he was just starting in
to get all harnessed up for the nuptials

  now mind you i knew my rudolph like
a little book hed always choose the
easiest way and that was what i was
depending on

   rudolph says i  oblige me by put-
ting your coat back on again you might
bring your hat too youre going to need
it but first i want you to come down-
stairs with me im going to do a little
telephoning and i want you to listen in

  well of course rudolph didnt get the
idea but he obliged-even to the hat

  id noticed a phone in the down-stairs
hall and with rudolph standing by i got
central and gave the number it seemed to
excite rudolph the number did

   thats mr fitchs number  says he

   right-o says i one mind in a
thousand boy once you learn a thing
youre like the elephant it never forgets-
mr fitch listen mr fitch this is a
friend i said a friend friend never
anything to oblige



mind that you understand i dont want
to get mixed up in this thing but-ive
got something to tell you something you
ought to know

   its about this fellow rudolph van
rennselaer the one thats going to marry
your daughter yeh rudolph mr fitch
i think youd be interested to know that this
fellow is already married thats what i
said got one wife already she lives in-
 what youre going to see about that
well i would mr fitch-i certainly
would 

  and writh that i hung up

  now- of course id figured on this little
move of mine having considerable effect
on rudolphs state of health but-it turned
out to be a knockout the only thing that
held him up was the wall

   now you human marshmallow says

i	 you know father and you know
prunella and if i aint mistaken theyre
the kind of people that get action first and
ask questions afterward-especially father
will you wait here to be murdered or-

  lets go gasped rudolph - and
started

  t chased after him

  and then as rudolph and i went plung-
ing down the front steps of mrs platts
boarding-house a little dame that looked all
worried up and excited came running up
the walk and when she saw rudolph

   rudolph  she gave one of those glad
cries-and fell on him

   it-it isnt too late she gasped

   no madam i says  it aint too late
-yet but it will be in about four minutes
and if vouu excuse me whats the idea
who-

   im his wife says she-just like that

  and one look at rudolph convinced me

   into the car brigham young i yelled
at him  and you too mrs young
well thresh-this out while were on our
way just now weve got to be going 

  and so thats the story that i told the
chief

   and do you mean to say joe that you
had no idea that this fellow was married
asked the chief

  no more idea than a rabbit i told
him

  and of course as you know i hadnt
i had rudolphs number and i knew that
no matter how innocent he might be hed
rather run than face father so would i
id figured that that little stunt of mine
would jar rudolph into action-and it did

  as for the real state of affairs no doubt
it was like this after miss prunella fitch
had got rudolph deep enough into her toils
as they call em rudolph didnt have the
nerve to tell the truth and he couldnt
make up his mind to break away and
there he was-till i came and saved him

  it was a good deal as mrs rudolph van
rennselaer told me herself seems a trav-
eling man who was a friend of hers had
got wind of where rudolph was and had
heard about this proposed second marriage
of rudolphs and-well she wasnt too late
as it turned out she and rudolph had had
one of those family affairs and-

   but she told me  after rudolph had
gone away i realized that that creature
had simply thrown herself at him and all
hed done was to try and be decent to her
because-well you know thats the way
rudolph is hes so obliging and-and
everything and of course thats the way
he got into this last trouble hes so oblig-
ing

    obliging is right says i

tubby took his feet off the fender of
the little stove in the back room of
oconnors grocer and glared at
his two friends aggressively

   that aint so he declared  that
aint so nohow

   well he said the first man repeated
 as how thats just the way it is-that
light travels one hundred and eighty-six
thousand miles in a second

   taint so said tubby  thats too
fast for anything to go

   thats what he said the first man re-
iterated imperturbably  one hundred and
eighty-six thousand miles in a second-
thats what he said

   well taint so tubby repeated he
rose to his feet suddenly  you can see
light cant you he demanded

 course i can see light i aint blind
 can you see a automobile when its
going past a hundred miles a hour tubby
pointed a fat little forefinger directly into
the first mans face

   why why yes said the first man
surprised into confusion

   and can you see the spokes of a auto-
mobile wheel when its going past a hun-
dred miles a hour

 the first man thought a moment
 why why no he said finally

  tubby lowered his forefinger  then
that proves it aint so he declared tri-
umphantly  nor you couldnt see a bul-
let if i shot it past your nose could you

   you couldnt jake the second man
put in

   no you couldnt said tubby  nor
you couldnt see light if it went that fast
neither aint i right could you

   hes right jake said the second man

  tubby sat down

   well he said the first man resumed
unabashed-he said as how light travels
one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles
in a second and furthermore and in
addition he said as how some of the stars
were so far away that it takes the light
hundreds and hundreds of years just getting
here from them

   it was all in the movie said the
second man wearily   the wonders of
light -i remember it

   well  dont believe it said tubby
 because i know it aint so-not none of
it

  he stood up again then with sudden
thought he waddled across the room to the
open window

   come here he said commandingly
the two other men joined him

   aint them stars up there he asked
he pointed through the open casement to
a brilliant cloudless summer evening sky

   yes-thems stars all right the first
man agreed  if thats what you mean

   that aint what i mean said tubby
 i said  aint them stars up there are
they up there or aint they thats what
i want to know
the light machine



   theyre up there all right jake said
the second man

   if you can see them mustnt they be
there tubby persisted

   yes said the first man  when you
can see them they must be there

   then said tubby-he paused impres-
sively- then the light of them must be
here and there at the same time am i
right

   hes right jake said the second man
 cause if it took the light a hundred
years to get here we couldnt see them for
a hundred years yet am i right

  the first man went back to the stove
tubby and the second man joined him after
a moment

   i aint telling you what  think the
first man remarked  im telling you
what he said-

   it aint got no sense said tubby

   im going to the movies said the
second man abruptly  come on

  not me said tubby mi ate too
much im going to sleep

   its  the burning of rome  said the
first man u nero playing the piano while
the city burns come on its good-i
seen the pictures

  and reluctantly tubby allowed himself
to be led away

  the little moving picture theater was
hot and stuffy tubby found an aisle seat
with his friends near the back for a
quarter of an hour or more he sat blinking
at the flickering screen the topical re-
view interested him not at all he yawned
and squeezed his fat little body lower into
the hard narrow seat 

  then the picture changed it was not
 the burning of rome  yet but a short
picture evidently science tubby frowned
at it in silence

  the first man nudged him  wake up
he said  heres a astronomical picture
about the stars wake up itll be good

	the burning of romes  next

   i aint asleep tubby whispered back
 im thinking

  the wonders of celestial space were
unfolding before tubbys eyes but he
hardly saw them he was thinking of
what jake had said-those tremendous

figures jake had reeled off to him what
was it he had said one hundred and
eighty-six thousand miles in a second
there were sixty seconds in a minute and
sixty minutes in an hour that would
be-

   taint so he muttered to himself
doggedly

  he felt a light touch on his arm and
looked up to see a little man standing be-
side him in the aisle in the dim light
tubby could not see the little man very
well but he could see that he did not know
him

  the little man bent down toward tubbys

ear

   i want to talk to you he whispered

   what about said tubby

  the little man shook his head  i cant
talk in here come outside for a moment

  tubby hesitated

   its very important the little man
added  you must come-just for a mo-
ment ive wanted to see you for a very
long time

  tubby clambered to his feet his two
friends absorbed in the picture before them
did not notice him leave in silence he
followed the stranger back up the aisle to
the lighted theater lobby

   ive wanted to sec you for a long time
the little man repeated tubby could see
now he was a very little man with a thin
frail body and a very big head set upon a
long spindly neck his hair was snow-
white and long about his ears his yellow
face was seamed with lines but most of it
was hidden by flowing side-whiskers and
by a pair of huge iron-rimmed spectacles
he wore a long black frock coat that hung
from his thin shoulders like a shroud

   im a professor said the stranger
lie held out a shriveled taloned hand  a
professor of light he added impressively

   oh said tubby

   my name is obadiah oats

  tubbv shook hands  mines tubby
he said  pleased to meet you

  the professor put on his high hat which
made him nearly as tall as tubby

   i want to consult you on a matter of
very great importance to both of us he
said slowly


all-story weekly

  tubby waited

   about light the professor added
lie linked his arm in tubbys confidentially
 i need your help they tell me youre
the smartest man in town i wanted to
find you with a brain like yours and
mine-

   yes said tubby breathlessly when
the professor paused

   my laboratorys right across the
street said the little man  ill sliowr you
tubby followed the professor out of the
theater through a little doorway across the
street and up several flights of rickety
stairs into a room on the top floor of the
house

   this is where i work said the pro-
fessor  sit down

  it was a large room with endless row of
bottles upon tiers of shelves lining its walls
several long tables stood about and tubby
saw they were crowded with curious appa-
ratus-little tubes in racks microscopes
triangular pieces of glass with candles be-
hind them and several contrivances of
wheels and weights that looked like clock
works in the exact center of the room
was one larger apparatus of a sort tubby
had never seen before it seemed very com-
plicated and he stared at it with awe he
could make nothing out of it except that
part of it was a huge telescope extending
up through the skylight of the room he
glanced upward and there through a nar-
row open slit in the glass he could see the
stars shining

   thats a light machine said the pro-
fessor following his glance  theres only
one in the world and there it is

   yes said tubby

   its the most wonderful machine that
was ever built the professor went on
softly  i built it and now you are go-
ing to help me make money out of it

   yes said tubby  how

   thats what you are going to tell me
dont you see i am a man of science-
you are a business man thats the dif-
ference between us

   yes said tubby

   first ill have to explain you have a
head for figures of course

  no-yes said tubby of course

  but you dont know much about
light

   yes-no said tubby

   naturally how could you nobody
does-but me and i know all about it-
all he emphasized the last w-ord impres-
sively  and now im going to tell it to
you

  thank you very much said tubby
and waited

   all my life began the professor-he
spoke softly his eyes fixed on tubby
seemed staring at dim distant spaces-all
my life-since i was a little boy-i have
been studying the properties of light it is
a very wonderful thing-you realize that
do you not-the most wonderful thing in
the whole of science

   oh yes said tubby

  the professor drew in a deep breath
like a long sigh reversed  light he be-
gan again  is a vibratory wrave in the
ether you know what the ether is

   no said tubby

   it is like air but you cannot breathe
it it exists everywhere-even in the
outermost realms of space now do you
understand

   yes said tubby

   light is vibration of the ether the
professor went on in his droning voice
 its vibrations travel through the ether at
the rate of one hundred and eighty-six
thousand three hundred and twenty-four
miles a second

   i know that said tubby

   you are learned man the professor
said admiringly  you have a wonderful
mind i knew you had-they said so

   yes said tubby  go on

  the professor jerked his little body up-
right in his chair suddenly so suddenly
that tubby started violently with fright

  how long is a second the professor
asked aggressively

   why-tick-tick thats it said
tubby

  the professor relaxed in his chair  you
are a clever man you will have your little
joke

   but we must be serious i will tell
you how long a second is it is exactly
one-thirty-one millionth five hundred and
the light machine



fifty-eight thousandth one hundred and
forty-ninth part of a vear

   oh said tubby

   do you know what a year is

   three hundred and sixty-five days
said tubby promptly

  the professor smiled again  a year is
the time it takes the earth to revolve once
around the sun thus you see there are
 seconds in a year-which is a
little more than  days

   yes said tubby  i see

   now to find out how far light travels
in a year we simply take its speed per
second and multiply it by sixty that is
its speed per minute multiply that by
sixty gives it speed per hour and so on
up to a day or a year do you under-
stand

   yes said tubby  how-how far
does it go in a year

  the professor raised his hand

   that is a very simple problem-only
mental arithmetic for me wait let us
go further

   yes said tubby  go on

   the distance light travels in one year
is called a light-year now some of the
stars are so far away that it takes light
many centuries to come from them travel-
ing at that speed i have just mentioned
thus we measure their distance from us
as so many hundred light-years do you
see

   yes said tubby  how-how many
miles away from us is the farthest star-
the very farthest

  the professor leaped to his feet  ah
i was expecting you to ask that his
face was beaming  you are a clever man
but im ready for you i figured it all out
this afternoon and wrote it down ill show
you

  he led tubby to a comer of the room
tubby saw a perfectly enormous roll of
narrow paper tape like the tape that comes
from a stock ticker or is rolled up around
baby ribbon only this roll was bigger
than he was it was hung vertically on a
spindle which had a handle to rotate it
so that the tape could be unwound and
wound again easily a few feet away there
was a similar spindle but empty

   i wrote it down for you the professor
repeated- the distance in miles of the
furthest star from the earth i wrote it
down-on this

  he took the loose end of the tape and
reeling off a few feet hooked the end onto
the empty spindle

   watch closely he said  im going
to showr you the number

  he started to wind up the tape on the
empty spindle tubby stood close beside
the strip of tape stretching the space be-
tween the two spindles it passed directly
under his face 

   watch closely said the professor
again  there comes the first of it
tubby saw a row of little digits start on
the tape the first three were  then
after the comma began a string of ciphers
after each three ciphers was another comma

  the moving tape carried this endless row
of little ciphers swiftly under tubbys nose
he stared at them fascinated faster and
faster they flew by as the roll of tape wound
up on the spindle the professor was turn-
ing for half an hour he turned briskly
then the row of ciphers stopped just as the
other end of the tape fluttered off the un-
winding spindle

  the professor leaned against the wall
breathing hard

   that-was-the-number he gasped
tubby blinked  what-what number
was it he-asked finally

  the professor recovered his breath and
sat down again in his chair wearily

   it was one hundred and fifty-four zin-
tillions he answered  the largest num-
ber that has ever been written down 
wrote it down this afternoon

   yes said tubby  it was a big
number

  the professor pulled at his side-whiskers
thoughtfully  we must get on he said
 now you understand how far the stars
are away and how fast light travels
that brings us to my light machine
tubby sat up with interest to the
light machine yes go on

   as you can see the professor con-
tinued  i know all about light-i am its
master no one in the world knows as
much about light as i do and only one


all-story weekly

man in the world thinks he does the
professors eyes gleamed vindictively  ah
how i hate him that man 

   who tubby asked with interest
 what is his name

   his name is einstein answered the
professor  i hate him-i loathe him-i
despise him

   oh said tubby  im sorry

   but he cannot harm me im too
clever for him and you will help me
we still have time-he cannot prove any-
thing yet

   no-yes said tubby

  the professor stood up  let us get on
with my invention then youll see what
a wonderful man i am  will be brief
tubby joined him beside the telescope
in the center of the room

   what you must understand first said
the professor  is my theory of light
tubby waited

   no light is ever destroyed the pro-
fessor continued  it passes beyond our
vision that is all but it always exists
somewhere in the outer realms of space
 thats where it goes when it goes out
tubby put in  aint i right

   yes said the professor  thats
where it goes-out into the realms of
space

   now what you must understand is that
light can be reflected refracted polarized
but never destroyed he pointed to his
instruments on one of the tables   can
do all those things to it-and a thousand
more-but i cannot destroy it

  u right said tubby  but if you put
it out you cant never get it back can you
now

  the professor beamed on him genially
 your brain works too keenly he said
 you anticipate me no  cannot get it
back but it comes back thats just the
point-it comes back thats what nobody
in the world knows except me-me and you

   the sun he went on  gives us most
of our light-it gets here to the earth from
the sun in a few minutes the moon gives
us reflected sunlight it is the same light
only it comes to us from the sun by way of
the moon it takes a little longer that
way

   how much tubby asked

   not much-just a few seconds-the
moon is not far away now  this light
that strikes the earth is reflected back into
space in a hundred years-less or more
according to the distance-it strikes the
different stars there it mingles with other
light and then mark me well and
then -the professor paused impressively-
 then in another hundred years it comes
back to us again-the same light-mixed
with other light of course-but some of the
same light we had two hundred years be-
fore do you understand

   no-yes said tubby

   that said the professor  is the oats
theory of the rationality of light i call
it that because it is rational-it is in ac-
cordance with all known physical laws

   some others i could name -the pro-
fessors voice shook with suppressed pas-
ion his eyes gleamed again wickedly-
 some others are not so scrupulous their
theories do not coincide with recognized
physical laws-they transgress them all
mere astronomical outcasts-mathematical
lepers-scientific pariahs-

   oh-you mean that other guy said
tubby

  the professor calmed himself with an
effort he pulled a huge black silk hand-
kerchief from his pocket and mopped his
dripping forehead

   we wont talk of him he said after
a moment

   no we better leave him out of it
tubby agreed  aint i right

  the professor nodded  now we come
to my great discovery ill tell you about
that now

   when this sunlight is reflected from the
moon to us it brings with it an image of
ithe moon which was not in the light when
it left the sun do you understand

   no-yes said tubby

   thats why we can see the moon-the
light brings us the image all light carries
ah image of something-thats why we can
see things

   now when light leaves the earth and
goes out into space it takes with it an
image of the earth and everything that is
happening on the earth
the light machine



   right said tubby  go on

   now some of this light may have to
travel a hundred years before it reaches a
star when it does it mixes with other
light and is reflected back in another hun-
dred years to us but-mark you this-
but it still carries the image of the earth
and what happened on the earth when it
was here

   but you dont see that  said tubby
 we see the star aint i right

   yes said the professor  of course
youre right and the reason we see the
star is because that image is the last one
the light got that is predominate all
the others are there-but they are hidden
away beneath the star image

   oh said tubby

   nobody ever knew they were there
and so of course nobody ever tried to get
them out but  knew they were there-
thats the oats theory oj the rationality
of light and i have got them out  his
voice rose in triumph  thats the light
machine-the greatest invention in the his-
tory of the world 

   oh the light machine said tubby
when the professor paused

   the oats light machine-here it is-
the only one in the world ill show you
at once

  he switched off the lights the room
was quite dark except for a little beam of
white light that seemed to thread its way
through the intricate system of mirrors and
prisms of the light machine tubby could
not see where this light came from or where
it went to but he saw distinctly that it
turned several corners and was alternately
broad and narrow it was white through-
out most of its course but in one short
span it was a dark angry red and in
another a deep beautiful purple

   the light machine the professor be-
gan his fingers caressed one of its little re-
flectors lovingly  is able to extract from
light all the images it holds no matter how
long they have been there

   thats wonderful aint it said tubby
with admiration

   yes let me show you here is the
telescope i train it on a star-a star
mark you that is not a sun but that shines

by reflected light this beam of starlight
contains moonlight earthlight sunlight
our sunlight you know-and the light
from millions of other suns the starlight
comes out from here -he touched the
lower end of the telescope

  now you see this ray of my own cre-
ated light passes directly in front of where
the starlight comes out-thats where they
mix

  tubby saw the little beam of white light
crossed at right angles to the telescope eye-
piece and passed very close to it

   this light of my own is created by
burning zonogen-a gas i discovered my-
self

   from this point where the starlight
joins it my ray goes to the spectroscope -
he touched another portion of the light
machine- and it is polarized here
these -he indicated a long row of tiny
black compartments tubby could see the
beam of light entering at one end and
emerging at the other- these are my
image extractors each takes from the
light some of its images-leaving finally
only the earthlight and the images that be-
long to it

   there are many other processes-some
day you will understand them all but for
now-let me show you the result

   the pure earthlight passes last of all
into my projector see it here he laid
his hand on what looked to tubby some-
thing like a magic lantern

   my operating power is electricity
he turned a switch tubby first heard a
low hum and then a whirring clicking
sound

   this projector magnifies the image-
throws it up on a screen he pointed to
the wall tubby saw a small square of
canvas hung on the wall

   now then the professor continued
his voice trembling with emotion  that
star my telescope is pointing at is now ex-
actly nine hundred and twenty-seven and
one half light-years away that means
that eighteen hundred and fifty-five years
ago to-night the light we are getting back
now from that star left the earth do you
know what was happening eighteen hundred
and fifty-five years ago to-night


all-story weekly

   no said tubby  yes lots of
things

   i can pick anything i want from the
light the professor answered  i merely
tunc my instruments differently like
wireless you know-its all a matter of vi-
bration i have picked the most important
thing that was happening-the  burning
of rome  

  he turned another switch the clicking
sound grew louder on the sheet tubby
saw a great city in flames he seemed to
be standing on a hill looking down at it
in the foreground he saw the young roman
emperor with his mistress his friends and
his music as they reclined at ease watching
the destruction tubby stared for a long
time fascinated

 you are looking into the past he
heard the professors droning voice saying
i  all that has been stored up in the light
all these years it is light itself-the work
of god not of man

  that is nero sitting there no one
living to-day on this earth has ever seen
him before but there he is-nero the
cruel emperor of rome we see him
you and i for we are looking into the past
-looking into the past the professors
voice trailed off into silence

  tubby stared breathlessly his heart
was beating fast he was trembling all over
he felt suddenly a little faint he was in
a cold sweat and he sat down abruptly in
a little wooden chair beside the light ma-
chine

  the scene before him was very vivid he
could almost hear the emperors music
why he did hear music funny the
professor had not mentioned that

  the clicking noise grew louder the
scene before him was so bright he could see
nothing else around it was very dark and
very close and stuffy where was the pro-
fessor why didnt he say something
about the music

  tubby grew a little frightened he
shifted his feet uneasily the little chair
in which he was sitting was very uncom-
fortable it cramped him his back hurt
after a little while the scene before him
slowly faded the lights in the room
flashed on a rustling and a shuffling of
many feet sounded in his ears

  tubby sat up abruptly blinking in the
sudden light

   some kid that nero-eh jake said
a voice beside him

   you said it some picture come on
tubby lets go home said the first man

a year ago

 by ethelwyn pomeroy 

a year ago just such a night as this

 with white stars dreaming in the summer
you bent above me tenderly and i
lifted my face to your first eager kiss

we knew the flaming splendor of loves blis
while eons and eternities swept by
swift as the passing of a little sigh-

a year ago-just such a night as this

we did not dream that we should be so wise-
we did not know that love which was so sweet
could faint and die and fade to dull regret-
and yet to-night with cold indifferent eyes

we passed each other swiftly on the street

did you remember too did you forget

a sequel to a man named jones 

by charles b stilson

author of  the little crooked master polaris of the snowi  minos of sardanea etc

     we have published few stories that have met with so hearty and enthusiastic
a reception as that accorded  a man named jones  by our readers and the
sequel is every bit as good as the earlier yarn it concerns the hunt for an emerald
mine in peru and adventures with a tribe of remarkable people who change-but no
well leave the story for the author we can say though that you will meet some
old friends besides jones and katherine-among them the martian nambe and
that smiling villain grimshaw and if theres a slow or uninteresting page in the
whole yarn we havent been able to find it

the cartoonists have cast several men for that
most ungrateful of roles  the man who is
always taking the joy out of life personally
we would like to propose the scientist for the part
because he is the man who resolves our emotions

ambitions into freudian complexes in spite of

another ten-foot chain letter

 to the editor

   i have just finished reading the ten-foot
 chain by max brand e k means p p
 sheehan and achmed abdullah and they are all
 fine stories only i do not agree with i p




all-story weekly

sheehan and e k means that love is mere
passion only i think that love true love that is
based on these three planes mental spiritual and
physical can survive all tests even the loo-close
physical contact of daily life where two people
who love art in perfect harmony with each other
mentally physically and spiritually there is a
tender comradeship and perfect understanding
which can withstand all tests even che ten-foot
chain i think that love is a divine	of the

unquenchable fire that is in god love is some-
thing more than mere passion implanted in the
breast of man to preserve the continuity of the
race true love broadly speaking humanizes and
uplifts man and draws him nearer to god love
makes men more kindly affectioned toward one
another and checks in a measure although not
wholly the natural evil in man love is mans
spiritual being-the link between god and man
is mother-love mere passion if not neither is
lovers love for all love is linked together but
some one will say we are not talking of mother-
love which is very different from love between
man and woman yes it is different but sunlight
when it is divided into separate parts produces
different colors-red violet blue et cetera the
colors are all different from each other neverthe-
less are they not all of the same sunlight so
it is with love which is divided into different
kinds mother love love between man and woman
brotherly love et cetera but after all the funda-
mental principle of all love is the same

  give us some sequels to the following  th
rambin kid  the gold girl  the untamed
 the moon pool  mr shen of shensi all
the stories in your magazine are one hundred per
cent perfect guess ill close as this letter is too
long already it would be interesting to read
other readers opinions of  the ten-foot chain 
in the heart to heart talks p a cooper

  horseheads new york

from a real daughter of the west

to thk editor

  i have long been an interested reader of the
aix-story weekly and while not a subscriber i
have seldom missed buying it every week since it
was first published as a weekly magazine i can
truthfully say that it has helped to pass away
many evenings out here on the ranch which other-
wise would have seemed very lonesome during
the strike we missed it very much

  in heart to heart talks in l he all-story
weekly of april  i read a letter from edwin
irvine haines broad street new york city in
regard to the west and western stories while i
agree with him that western stories as a rule
describe the old life of the west rather than the
present time i think mr hainess own knowledge
of the west could be improved upon in criticiz-
ing the story  th hamblin rid by earl w
bowman he says  the author speaks of automo-
biles and garages and cowboys wearing chaps

almost in the same paragraph well why not
it only goes to show that mr bowman knows
what he is writing about

  on nearly every western ranch to-day one can
see at least one automobile often two or three as
well as trucks and tractors but neither the
western rancher nor the cowboy goes to town
dressed in velveteens with cavalry puttees but in
modern business suits differing very little from
those worn in the frenzied financial district of
broad street new york city

  however nearly every western rancher or
cattleman wears chaps when riding after stock
he wears chaps not in imitation of some  movie
hero but for comfort and protection to his
clothing if the gentleman from new york could
take part in one of the fall round-ups when the
cattle are driven from their summer range in the
mountains to the home ranches in the valley
when the cow-punchers are riding from daylight
until dark through timber and brush often all
day in the rain he would appreciate the comfort
of a good pair of chaps he would understand
that chaps spurs high-horned saddles and  lass
ropes  all have their places in the busy life of
the western stockman and are kept not for show
but for service and for that same reason most
every cowboy carries a forty-five or modern auto-
matic not to shoot up the town but to shoot
coyotes badgers or other animals that infest the
range as for rifles they are taken on hunting
trips of course but are a mighty awkward article
to carry when riding a fractious bronco

  my home is on the old ranch that my grand-
father took up in  so i think i am entitled to
call myself a native daughter of the northwest

 only kick-sells too fast

to the editor

  there is only one objection i have to the all-
story weekly and that is it sells too fast in
tliis little railroad town they stand around and
wait for it on the day it arrives so you can see
what chance i have of getting mine regularly with
three little children to take care of and rarely
ever time to leave the house  have to wait
until my husband gets home in the evening and
by the time he gets over to town the magazines
are all taken

   i used to read nearly all the current magazines
but now i liave abandoned nearly all in favor of
the all-story weekly and after the kiddies are
tucked in for the night i devour it indeed the
clean stories you print are a relief these days i
have been reading the all-story weekly now
for close on to six years week in and week out

   i first started reading it while on a visit to my
mother in albany oregon and i became inter-
ested in a wonderful story which i think was
entitled  under the andes she had a great
stack of all-storys and cavaliers after that i
was an all-story fan  always read the heart
heart to heart talks



to heart talks and it is interesting to learn the
various opinions of all-story weekly readers
some like one thing and some like another for
myself i hardly ever miss a story if i have time
to read it

  i note what edwin  haines said in regard to
cowboys-he did not think  th ramblin kid 
ran true to form well mr haines may be
familiar with some ranches where the cowboys
wear velveteens corduroys and calvary puttees
but i wonder if he was ever out with a round-up
i know of a good many ranches throughout the
southwest and i am a native of arizona where
the cowboys still stick to chaps high-heeled boots
et cetera of course the days of indiscriminate
killings are over and the cowboy of to-day is not
so free with the festive forty-five

  like many others we would like a sequel to
 the moon pool it was a wonderfully written
story	mrs henry hayes smith

  barstow california

 little heart-beats

  i do not know if i have ever read a magazine
that i like better than the ail-story weekly
i have been a constant reader for the past four
years and in that time i have only missed one
issue and the reason for that was they were sold
out before i could get one so to avoid the failure
of missing any more  am sending a years sub-
scription

  i like nearly all the stories that are in the all-
story weekly once in a while there is one
that does not appeal to me but i always read
every story in it as a friend of mine says from
kiver to kiver i always take ray books to him
to read as be is crippled and is not able to get
out after the books and he enjoys them im-
mensely i would like to see a sequel to the
 moon pool and  palos of the dog star pack
as they were great also a sequel to untamed
and a man named jones and misery man-
sions

  i think max brands stories are fine i would
also like to see some more of the semi dual
stories with best wishes to all-story weekly

  rock island illinois	earl r knisel

  we have long been readers of this magazine but
always bought it of the news-stands since mov-
ing to the country we go in town so irregularly
that the news-stands are often sold out and we
lose out on some of our stories we like most all
the stories except the so-called  different  stories
it would take up too much time and space to
tell all the ones we like or our favorite authors
anyway we shouldnt like to miss any of them

  elba arkansas	mrs winnie oolesly

  i just finished reading the ten-foot chain
and want to express my opinion of it it is good
and all four stories could easily apply to the
four different cases it is just this real love

with no chance for doubt could not be hurt but
if doubt enters the chances are very good- for a
rupture- you will find that faith is the basis of
all four of the stories faith is the mother of
love of hope and of honor doubt is the father
of fear and fear is the little devil that causes so
much sorrow in this old world for once you
doubt you begin to fear and when fear comes
hate slips in so to get back to the point the
success of love depends on one thing-faith
that is my opinion and i believe that all four
of the boys are right in their own way

 omaha nebraska	h f jones

  in all-story weekly of april  mr edwin
irvin haines makes the statement that cowboys
of to-day do not wear chaps he says  if a cow-
boy wore chaps on one of the ranches of to-day
he would be hooted out of town on the spot
mr haines gives his address broad street new
york now we live in sunny southern california
and are personally acquainted with a cowboy
that not only does wear chaps and gun but
makes his own chaps tans the hide and makes
the chaps fringes and all and weals them to town
when he rides hut leaves them at home when he
drives into town in his car if mr haines would
ride the hills with our cowboy friend he would
see the reason for both chaps and gun if he
did not wear the chaps his pants would be torn
by the brush through which he must go on his
daily rounds and his gun is needed for coyotes
we have been readers of the all-story weekly
magazine a good many years mrs s f davis

  chico california

  in one of your recent issues a man from the
east attempts to inform the readers about the
west he says among other things that a cow-
puncher who wore chaps would be hooted out of
town say if he ever saw a cow-puncher that
wore putts he has seen something i never saw
and i have seen many of them also about the
chaps i wear them as does every sensible rider
who lias any respect for his comfort or health and
ive never been hooted out of town either
imagine if you can riding fifty-five or sixty miles
in a day sometimes in a drenching rain with no
protection for your legs it doesnt set well with
a westerner born and raised west of the rockies
to hear an easterner attempt to set the readers
right about western apparel also while s are
not as universally in evidence as formerly yet
they have not all disappeared

   have been reading your magazine among many
others for years and am forced into my first
offense by the letter of e h w in your issue
of april io he-or is it she-sounds iike a
sophomore  have for my sins been one myself
and fed  can recognize the species not like the
 different  stories then one must not enjoy
reading poe or haggard or doyle or dumas or
dante or shakespeare

  permit me to congratulate you on the biggest
find in pure literature which has been made in
the past five years jeremy lane the fragrant
web  was a jewel and  oblivion  promises
well many of your shorts are of course trivial
but most of the continued stories are worth while
taken by and large  know of few publications
so uniformly good long life and good luck

 st louis missouri	henry l king

  i have been reading the all-story weekly
about three years and i must say its about the
best ever a few of the stories that i liked best
were the gold girl the people of the
golden atom  raspberry jam the house
with a bad name  the unlatched door  the
conquest of the moon pool i like the continued
stories and novelettes-they are longer the
thunder of doom by katherine and robert
pinkerton was the best story that was ever writ-
ten i think that the whole word ought to get
together and give three rousing cheers for the
all-story weekly	thelma myers

  ranger texas

  i have been a reader of your magazine ever
since i was ten years old or rather it was the
cavalier then i sure enjoy it fine my mother
and myself could not do without it i did not
like  ashes to ashes i do like everything else
in your magazine though so i havent got any
right to kick as i see lots of others did wont
you give us a good story of the east i also
like your western stories i think  tb ramblin
kid  is just fine but dont we get a sequel to
that it is a shame lo leave carolyn june and
the gold dust maverick waiting for captain jack
to come back with his master send the magazine
as soon as possible as i want to hear how the
stories end up	miss ottie grantham

by jackson gregory

author of  wolf breed   the short cut  the joyous trouble maker  six feet four ate

    to the large circle of readers who know and appreciate mr gregorys justly popular
work this story will come as a surprise-but certainly not an unpleasant one l is out of
his usual line at least in so far as setting is concerned but the reader soon realizes that it
is still a jackson gregory story-gregory transplanted having become accustomed to the
northwest winds blowing through this very capable authors very competent stories of athabasca
or thereabouts lhe story of robert ashe beginning as it does with the savor of san franciscos
slums and gangsters and crooked policemen hanging over it will seem a somewhat startling
departure but bobby ashe-lady fingers so-called-doesnt let it remain so very long he
soon leads the way out into the sunlight and the open spaces out among real humans
lady fingers is a wonderful character in a remarkable story and though he has done many
fine things of a different type mr gregory has never done anything better all-story

you can do it-

you can play those jazzy song hits
as easily as you can hum a tune

   no-not by the do-re-mi method not by the old tiresome
method of notes and scales and arpeggios not at the great expense
of years of fruitless study	  v 

theres a new way the simplest quickest most interesting
method of learning to play the piano that you ever heard of

   experts say it is unique and cannot conceive why the method
was not discovered years ago

you can learn to play in  months

you can learn at home during your spare time it will not
require long hours of study and practising it is not expensive

   our amazing new course developed just a year ago has taught
hundreds of men and women how easy jazz music is to play

 many of these could not play at all when they began our course
 to-day they can reel off the latest snappiest jazz music by ear

ips the new method
that makes it possible

   for instance when you receive the course by mail youll be
surprised to find how easy it is to understand it just comes
natural to you to pick out pieces on the piano as we teach you

   and you make progress from the very start the lessons will
show you some real little tricks of playing our students after fin-
ishing the full course are able to play anything they hear all by ear

   the person who can play jazz today is popular in any crowd his
 talent gives life to any party

    and if he develops that talent as we teach him to develop it the
 opportunities for profit are splendid the stage is open to those who
 can play the piano as the niagara method teaches

    it may be hard to believe you may doubt as others have our abil-
 ity to teach you by mall in one-tenth the time and at one-tenth of the
 usual cost what most music teachers cannot teach you by personal
 instruction

    but if youll let us send you our literature youll find some proofs
 that will surprise you just write for our free booklet and see
