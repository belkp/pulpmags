a complete novel

chapter i

the men look poisonous but the
girl is rather pretty said ste-
phen dallas

          poisonous is scarcely the
word answered sir james-unless
you apply it to the big jew in the same
sense that it might refer to the hind
leg of a mule the girl is austrian i
fancy with perhaps a dash of italian
she would be rather a beauty-when
you got used to her

  she does not look to me as if you
would ever get used to her

  so much the better that is worth
far more than beauty

  the englishman let his big frame
sink back upon one elbow stretched his
long legs on the hot sand and looked

ia

off to sea dallas lit a cigarette and
glanced curiously toward the trio sit-
ting on the beach at a few yards dis-
tance

  the stones on that big jews hands
give me a vertigo said he and his
accent suggests a toucan with a cold
what beastly language are they talk-
ing 

  i dont know it seems to be all
spits and sputters with now and then a
bark

  sir james stopped spinning his mon-
ocle around his finger to screw it into
his eye and survey the trio under
the fixity of his british stare all three
turned with the same impulse and
looked at the two young men then
with equal unity of action all thre


the	magazine

scowled the girl with a sudden inten-
sity that brought a swarthy flush to her
clear skin the jew with a diabolical
raising of the outer ends of his black
bushy eyebrows the third member of
the party a thickset sulky-looking
young man whose personality sug-
gested an overfed black cat muttered
something which could not have been
amiable

  better not stare at her james said
dallas if she were to run over here
and bite you youd certainly go mad
i shall risk it said sir james to
find out if shes pretty he stared
placidly for a moment then blinked
out the monocle and turned to his
friend you are quite right old chap
she is

  i am beginning to change my mind
said dallas i dont think that i like
yellow eyes and blue hair the color
scheme should be reversed now shes
angry and going off to sulk she gets
up like a cat or a puma-all part of the
same swing gad shes got a figure
now dont stare her off the beach until
ive looked my word but you eng-
lish have beastly manners

  the girl had risen and was standing
beautifully poised looking at the sea
over the heads of her companions she
said a few words then moved off to-
ward the bathhouses

  shes going to bathe said sir
james believe ill have a dip myself
coming in

  no thanks too late in the season
i havent thawed out yet from yester-
days swim and ive got to run the car
this afternoon

  the englishman rose to his feet and
strode off toward the bathhouses it
was late in september and the little
resort was almost deserted dallas and
his friend had dropped in en tour on
the motor car belonging to the former

  in a few moments sir james came
stalking down the beach an attractive
masculine combination of fresh athletic

skin long clean muscles and yellow
hair his very blue eyes like lapis lazuli
against his brick-red complexion the
two friends were of markedly different
type as dallas was of medium height
slender wiry of a high nervous ten-
sion and with the face of a very hand-
some and thoroughbred woman his
eyes were a clear gray with lashes very
long and black no one had ever seen
him thrown out of poise

  sir james stretched his naked limbs
luxuriously upon the hot sand and
looked with cheerful expectation to-
ward the bathhouses

  why dont you loll out your tongue
and prick up your ears and wag your
tail james snapped dallas irritably
cant you decently cloak your emo-
tions  and i must say you have plenty
of cheek to calmly go in swimming with
that girl

  the channel is free to all and why
is a woman made pretty if not to at-
tract the eyes of men ah

 dallas looked around and saw the
girl coming down the beach she was
enveloped in a white peignoir and fol-
lowed by an exceedingly pretty and
smart-looking maid her blue-black
hair was tied up in a yellow handker-
chief and her feet were bare and
beautifully shaped as she passed her
two companions the younger man fol-
lowed her with his eyes the jew was
writing or making some calculations in
a notebook and did not look up the
girl threw a quick glance toward sir
james which was observed hy her
friend who scowled

  jealous brute the cubby-faced beg-
gar drawled sir james did you see
that look how hed like to slide a
knife into me for presuming to tub in
the same ocean with the beauty oh i
say old chap look at her isnt she
stunning

  she makes the sea look quite dingy
dallas admitted

  the maid had taken her peignoir and
a princess of the balkans



the girl was standing at the waters
edge her superb figure cut sharp and
pure against the vivid background of
the sea ruffled by the strong land breeze
to a deep-toned ultramarine which was
flecked with wisps of snowy spray
her arms and legs were bare and the
rich sunlight lent to the flesh tints
something of its saffron tone as if
against her will she glanced back over
her shoulder at sir james then gave a
little involuntary toss of her chin which
caused the two young men to look at
each other with a smile

  then tuck yourself into the water
if you hate so to be admired muttered
dallas and perhaps his thought reached
the girl for she waded rapidly down
the steep beach and plunging in began
to swim seaward sir james watched
her and tugged thoughtfully at his wiry
mustache

  i wonder if she knows about the
offshore current he said

  dont worry shes bound across
for ramsgate

  there were some women and chil-
dren bathing and a few people sitting
here and there about the beach near
by a big fishing boat was hauled up
and a man was calking her seams dal-
las observed that he had stopped work
and was watching the girl who was
swimming steadily seaward higher up
on the beach were some other and
larger boats but the place was an open
roadstead with no inlet for miles and
there were no boats in the water

  she is getting too far out observed
sir james believe ill swim out and
warn her but youd better tell her
friends to call her back

  he rose lightly to his feet and waded
down the beach dallas hailed the two
men who had been with the girl

  beg pardon said he but i think
you had better warn madame not to
swim so far out there is a strong off-
shore current at this tide

  the big jew swung sharply about

and stared first at dallas then seaward
toward the girl

  sapristi i believe you said he
and hove himself awkwardly to his feet
raised both huge hands to his mouth
and shouted to the girl she was swim-
ming on her side and as the hoarse
hail reached her she looked back over
her shoulder then held steadily on

  tiens cried the jew but she
will not come

  again he shouted and this time the
girl threw up one hand with a mocking
gesture but held on seaward with her
strong rhythmic stroke sir james had
entered the water and was swimming
after her

  dallas looked about him in extreme
vexation there was probably not a
man in france who was in the habit
of taking as frequent and hazardous
risks as he when on the road with his
big car and he was also a fearless
hunter of big game and an almost reck-
less cross-country rider but he was
one of those individuals of nervous
temperament who while willing to take
chances themselves are nevertheless
extremely disturbed at the sight of
others exposed to danger moreover
he was himself an inlander a poor
swimmer and one to whom deep water
represented treachery and danger he
had never found himself on or in the
water without a certain instinctive
dread

  call her again he said almost
sharply my friend swam out there
yesterday and had hard work getting
back

  the younger man glanced at him
with an almost insolent expression but
the jew nodded his big shaggy head
then looked doubtfully at dallas who
observed that his eyes were very large
of a muddy brown and shot with small
hazel-colored spots

  unfortunately mademoiselle is of a
very obstinate disposition said he
she does not like to be told what to


the cpocpjlacft magazine

do but she is a very strong swim-
mer

  dallas frowned then glanced over to
where the fisherman was working at
his boat as he did so the man laid
down his calking iron and walked to-
ward the group

  madame has swum out farther than
is safe said he touching his cap at
this tide the current is very strong i
do not believe that madame will be able
to get back

  then we must shove your boat into
the water said dallas

 the man shrugged i do not be-
lieve that the boat would float msieu
he answered the calking is all pulled
out of her seams and the water would
run in very fast besides this the oars
and sail are in my cabin up on the top
of the cliffs

  the big jew scowled then looked
anxiously seaward by this time the
girl was over three hundred yards from
the beach and swimming straight out
quite unconscious of the strong current
on which she was borne-for the splash
of the water about her had prevented
her hearing what had been shouted
one hundred yards in her wake sir
james was plowing along in an effort
to overtake her

  the jew puffed out his cheeks and
stared at dallas in doubt and perplexity

  this is very bad said he these
silly women is your friend a strong
swimmer

  yes answered dallas but for all
that he had his work cut out for him
yesterday and to-day there is an off-
shore breeze which will blow the water
in their faces when they turn

  then said the jew suddenly leak
or no leak we must get that tub in the
water let us go and look at her
followed by the american he strode
over to the clumsy fishing boat which
was shored up on her beam ends as
the fisherman had said the oakum had
been ripped from her gaping seams

  is there no other boat fit to take
the water asked the jew in his harsh
raucous voice

  none except these others msieu
answered the fisherman but they are
very large and heavy and it would re-
quire at least eight men to launch one
then said the jew go as quickly
as you can and get more men for
we must have one of the boats
sapristi why will these women insist
on being so contrary

  the fisherman set off and dallas and
the jew stood watching the swimmers
with deep anxiety the handkerchief
about the head of the girl had become
a mere speck of yellow sir janies had
nearly reached her and as they looked
they saw that both swimmers had
turned and were facing the shore
then presently the two heads ap-
proached more nearly together

  for five minutes they watched in
silence then the jew looked at dallas
and shook his head

  they are losing ground said he
every minute they are being carried
farther out

  as he spoke both saw the yellow
handkerchief flutter violently waving
back and forth

  tiens cried the jew they are
in trouble that water is like ice
perhaps one of them has been seized
by a cramp come my friend we
cannot wait for the men we must
get this tub in the water

  but she will not float cried dallas
sapristi but she will have to float
i will paddle and you and the prince
can bail

  the prince

  yes my friend is the prince emi-
lio of rascia the lady is his cousin
i-he threw out his big chest-am
the baron isidor rosenthal come we
have no time to lose let us right this
tub and run her down the beach

  he gripped the gunwale in his power-
 princess of the bilkins



ful hands then kicked out the shores
and with a strong thrust rolled the boat
onto her keel as the beach was very
steep and composed of a shingle of
round smooth cobbles the launching of
the boat heavy as she was did not pre-
sent much difficulty

  rosenthal picked up a plank and
flung it upon the thwart then called to
his companion

  your highness must help there is
no time to lose

  there was an imperative note in the
harsh voice which permitted of no ques-
tion the prince got up walked over
sulkily and laid hold of the gunwale
opposite dallas

  now all together cried the jew
and put out his herculean strength
which was far greater than that of the
other two men combined once started
they ran the heavy boat down the steep
beach to the waters edge here they
paused for breath and dallas looking
seaward was startled to find that the
heads of the swimmers had almost dis-
appeared

  we must wade out with her
panted the jew come

  staggering forward splashing thigh
deep in the water they soon had the
boat afloat and dallas looking inside
her saw the water spouting in through
the open seams

  ach cried the jew but this
thing is like a grating we must be
quick or she will sink before we reach
them he looked at dallas and
grinned his bushy black eyebrows
were pushed up at their outer corners
and his heavy mustache was lifted bar-
ing his big yellow fangs

  peste we shall all be in the water
directly-and i cannot swim ugh i
have never liked water-he made a
grimace-except in wine but it does
not matter there is lumber enough ifi
the tub to float the lot of us until we
are picked up he leaped aboard and
dallas rather pale and with lips com-

pressed followed him and picking up
a bucket began rapidly to bail

  come lend a hand he snapped to
the prince there is a pan in the
stern

  but the prince took several back-
ward steps up the beach thank you
said he in a guttural voice but i am
not such a fool as to go to sea in a boat
like that

  but you must cried the jew
there is the lady thalia

  the prince shrugged it is her own
fault said he then turning on his
heel walked away

  cowardly little beast growled dal-
las nevermind shove off

  rosenthal picked up the heavy plank
thrust the boat ahead until the water
had deepened then seating himself in
the stern began to paddle with long
and powerful strokes dallas looking
up as he bailed saw that the jew was
chuckling to himself

  ridiculous my friend is it not
growled rosenthal without desisting
from his tremendous effort ha ha
ha he barked like a hoarse alligator
can you swim

  not in my clothes answered dal-
las who was bailing furiously in an
effort to reduce the volume of water
before the next open seam should be
submerged your prince emilio is a
filthy little coward but you are the right
sort

  i cried the jew but i am a
fool an imbecile  listen my friend
if the lady were to drown i should be
the gainer by forty thousand pounds
he chuckled

  what

  yes cried rosenthal paddling
with even greater vigor sapristi but
this tub is hard to move yes i have
sunk forty thousand pounds in silver
mines in their accursed country and
now i cannot work them because the
lady thalia is in the way it is a long
story if she would marry the prince


the vovulatr magazine

it would be all right or if she would
drown it would be all right he in-
creased his efforts until the veins stood
out in double cords upon his swarthy
forehead

  if that is true answered dallas
bailing rapidly i am rather proud to
be in the same sinking tub with you

  sapristi you flatter me but i am
that kind of a fool i want to get my
money of course but one cannot let
people drown for the sake of a filthy
forty thousand pounds

  they toiled away in silence driven
by the strong offshore wind and rosen-
thals tireless paddling the boat moved
steadily through the water glancing
ahead dallas saw that the swimmers
were nearer despite his efforts the
water in the boat was gaining on him
and he wondered how much longer they
could keep afloat he looked shore-
ward  there was a knot of people gath-
ered on the beach but he saw no sign
of the fisherman returning then he
glanced at his huge shipmate the jews
yellow teeth were bared as they clenched
his nether lip his big nostrils were
dilated and his face congested merely
to wield the heavy plank which he
gripped in his thick bejeweled fingers
would have been a feat of strength for
the ordinary man but rosenthal was
getting a powerful shove on the water
with every stroke moreover he was
constantly shifting his paddle from one
side to the other giving dallas a
shower bath each time that he swung
it over his head the young man ob-
served how the huge deltoids bulged
the shoulders of the jews serge coat
and presently the seams ripped under
the strain but the paddling went on
with the unabating rhythm of a ma-
chine nor was there any symptom of
fatigue

  as they drew near to the swimmers
dallas discovered first to his relief
then to his irritation that they were
paddling along easily and comfortably

and that sir james was making an
effort at conversation he looked at
rosenthal who grinned

  so said the jew they seem to
be quite comfortable

  as the boat reached them the two
swimmers laid hold of the gunwale
with a muscular effort of his strong
arms sir james hove himself aboard
then turning took the girl by both
wrists and lifted her out of the water
and onto one of the thwarts where she
sat like a lovely mermaid her bare
arms flashing and her legs hanging over
the side

  i say exclaimed the englishman
have you no oars

  no snapped dallas and you had
better get hold of that basin and throw
the water out or well have no boat
either

  the girl glanced sharply at his face
then dropped her head and stared into
the sea rosenthal had laid down his
paddle and was opening and shutting
his cramped fingers then taking a
penknife from his pocket he slashed
off a piece of rope from the painter
quickly unlaid it and began to force
the rope yarn into an open seam

  if you will help with the bailing
mademoiselle said he and you-
he glanced at dallas-will help me to
calk we may be able to keep our ship
afloat

  for several minutes the four worked
rapidly and in silence dallas and
rosenthal plugging the open seams
while the girl and sir james bailed
the jews suggestion proved an excel-
lent one as the seams of the lower
strakes had already been calked and the
water was coming in through the higher
ones which were within reach it
soon became apparent that they were
gaining rapidly upon the leak but the
boat had by this time drifted over a
mile from the shore the wind was
freshening and there was no sign of
any one coming to their rescue when
a frincbss of the balkans



the level of the water became only
ankle-deep dallas took the basin from
the girls hand then slipped off his coat

  put this on mademoiselle said he
the breeze is chilly

  she made a little gesture of dissent

  put it on put it on said dallas
with a touch of impatience one
might as well drown as catch pneu-
monia

  again the girls eyes turned on him
with their searching curious look
dallas noticed that they were of a deep
amber color and marvelously clear he
also observed that they held in them-
selves as much expression as one finds
in the sum of all the features of most
people

  almost with brusqueness he held out
the coat for the girl to put on

  come said he giving the garment
an impatient twitch again her eyes
flashed up at his this time with an
expression of resentment but some
quality in the cool gray ones of the
man caused them to drop instantly
with a muttered word of acknowledg-
ment the girl slipped her round white
arms into the sleeves dallas his man-
ner that of a kind but rather impatient
nurse buttoned the garment snugly to
her soft throat then gave a little twitch
drawing the skirt over the bare knees

  now you had better bail a little
he said not hard but enough to keep
you from getting chilled

  sir james had stopped his bailing
and was working at the open seam
the wind was freshening and carried
a certain sharpness which was soon felt
by the englishman after his long swim
in the cold water of the channel

  i s-s-say he began you m-m-
might have b-b-brought our clothes

  rosenthal pulled off his coat and
handed it to him

  put this on said he when we
came after you we were thinking less
of your comfort than of your safety
besides it looked as if we should all

be in the water before many minutes
and no doubt we should have been but

for the quick work of mr- he

looked inquiringly at dallas

  i am stephen dallas said the
young man my friend is sir james
fenwick

  the big jew lifted his hat with a
flourish

  permit me to thank you both said
he for the service which you have
rendered to the lady thalia-of nov-
ibazar he added as if in afterthought
i-he rose awkwardly to his feet
placing four fingers on his bulging
chest-am the baron isidor rosenthal
of hayti and buda-pesth x

  ch-ch-chawmed chattered sir
james dallas compromised with a
brief nod

  is prince emilio also of noviba-
zar he asked there was an intona-
tion in his voice which caused the girl
again to glance at him sharply her
clear eyes slightly contracted

  yes-unfortunately she answered
in a low throaty voice

  i quite agree with you snapped
dallas sir james glanced at his friend
in surprise

  oh c-c-come stephen said he
you are not very p-p-polite

i dont mean to be the prince de-
clined to come to the assistance of lady
thalia we needed him to help bail
n-n-no really sir james
stared

 there was a moment of awkward
silence

please pardon my ignorance said
dallas but just where is novibazar
ig-ig-ignoramus shivered sir
james the girl slightly raised her
pretty chin

  well then snapped dallas where
is it if you know so much about it
it is n-n-near-sir james glanced
critically at the girl in a violent effort
to guess at her parent stock-n-n-near
austria


the tpocpulacr magazine

  humph grunted dallas so are
italy and switzerland and germany and
russia and the balkan peninsula
sapristi but i can tell you where
it is growled rosenthal it is a
handful of hills between servia and
bosnia that is owned by turkey and
governed by austria and it is full of
holes where i have buried forty thou-
sand pounds

  and where we albanians cried
the girl fiercely have buried forty
thousand warriors-and more 

  ah said sir james then you
are alba-ba-banian 

  yes the girl spoke a soft but
strongly accented english i am al-
banian she drew herself up with
as much dignity as was possible for
a lady sitting with her bare legs cud-
dled under her and buttoned up in a
mans serge coat i am albanian or
shkipetari as we say our blood is
the purest in europe we are the
direct descendants of the ancient il-
lyrians we should be to-day an inde-
pendent state if it were not for cow-
ards like emilio and-she tossed her
head-jew adventurers

  permit me to remind you of the
fact said dallas severely that you
personally would be paddling around
the english channel if it were not for
baron rosenthal who although he
cannot swim embarked to your rescue
in a leaky open boat with neither oars
nor sail

   for an instant the girl stared then
 she leaped to her feet and stood with
 the water swirling about her pretty
 ankles a sudden flush had risen un-
 der the pallor of her fair skin and her
 eyes were sparkling with anger

  i will not be spoken to in that
way she cried nor will i be under
obligation either to baron rosenthal
or yourself i did not ask you to res-
cue me she slipped off dallas coat
and stood for an instant with her su-

 perb figure straight and poised as if to
 plunge over the side and into the sea

  sit down mademoiselle said dal-
las sharply there is no use in mak-
ing things any more complicated
b-b-brute shivered sir james
d-d-dont notice him lady th-th-
thalia or if you --iike jump in
again and i will g-g-go with you

  the girl turned and glanced at him
more color rushed into her face and
her lips began to twitch then she
turned toward rosenthal and smiled

  mr dallas is right she said i
am sorry rosenthal

  it is nothing said the baron we
jews are accustomed to such remarks
come children let us stop squabbling
the girl reseated herself on the
thwart and dallas a little ashamed of
himself picked up the coat and turned
to the girl

  i am sorry i was rude said he
wont you please put this on again
she gave him a forgiving smile and
slipped into his coat

  you must not judge the lady tha-
lia from her cousin emilio said
rosenthal the prince is of quite
different stock he is a serb and con-
nected with mademoiselle only by mar-
riage his title is merely one of cour-
tesy because he is descended from a
line of feudal chiefs

  we have no titles which correspond
to yours in england said the girl but
many of them are just as old

  myself said rosenthal i am a
papal baron

  a p-p-papal baron cried sir
james

  yes replied the jew and with
good right sapristi but with very
good right my title was conferred
upon me by the pope himself because
i prevented the massacre of a whole
christian community by a swarm of
moslem fanatics it cost me a thou-
sand turkish pounds-and a bullet in
the ribs
a princess of the balkans



  g-g-good for you cried sir james
as heartily as his congealed condition
would permit

  here comes a boat cried the lady
thalia

  all four looked back toward the dis-
tant shore where they saw a brown sail
fluttering in the breeze directly it bel-
lied out and a few minutes later a
heavy fishing boat came foaming up
and rounded to alongside

  the castaways quickly transshipped
when their own leaky vessel was
boarded by two of the fishermen who
stepped the mast and both vessels
started to beat back toward the beach

chapter ii

  that night as dallas was smoking
a final cigar on the terrace of the little
hotel he was joined by sir james who
had quite recovered from his immer-
sion

  i have been walking on the beach
with the lady thalia said the eng-
lishman cheerfully

  so i observed answered dallas
your philandering was likewise noted
by rosenthal and the prince the
former laughed but the latter appeared
to be displeased

  the beastly little rotter he would
have been even less pleased if he had
known what the princess was telling
me

  the result of which is i presume
that you have decided to elope and
wish me to lend you the car

 right-o answered sir james
cheerfully but that is not all we
look upon you personally to conduct the
elopement

  well replied dallas shortly i
wont

  dont be pig-headed stephen the
lady thalia is an exceedingly clever
and attractive girl she has honored
me by her confidence

  dallas grunted

  the whole situation said sir
james is very interesting it appears
that the kingdom of servia wants to
annex this sanjak or district which
is known as novibazar and which be-
longs to turkey although by the
treaty of berlin in  it came under
the administrative control of austria-
hungary together with bosnia and
herzegovina now the prince emilio
backed by rosenthal who is half wolf
half fox is intriguing with the servian
government and the lady thalia has
discovered a plot by which they intend
to stir up a frontier war with servia
which will give that country a good
excuse for grabbing novibazar there
is reason to believe that austria will
not be sorry to see it exchange turkish
ownership for servian

  what does the prince get out of
it

  he is to receive a lump- sum of
money and a governorship which will
permit him to squeeze the people even
tighter than he has already while ro-
senthal is to get certain concessions to
work his silver mines

  and the lady thalia

  ah theres the hitch the princes
people are all south slavonic serbs and
precisely the same breed as the servians
themselves they cant be made to see
the sense of fighting with servia which
is quite natural as all of their warfare
from time immemorial has beeri against
the turks and with the lady thalias
shkipetari so what the prince and
rosenthal are trying to do is to per-
suade the girl to incite her people to
start a ruction on the servian frontier
and she wont do it

  no shes far too clever the girl
is really patriotic she hates servia like
poison and so do her people who
are mostly mohammedans while the
princes crowd like the servians pro-
fess christianity but the lady tha-
lia is intelligent enough to see how
much her country has advanced under


the popular magazine

austrian rule and now she strongly
favors the annexation of novibazar by
austria-hungary she says that she
has positive information that bulgaria
is shortly going to assert her own in-
dependence and that when this happens
austria will grab bosnia and herzego-
vina and she wants novibazar to be
included in the annexation

  how does she hope to bring this
about 

  merely by keeping her people quiet
until bulgaria effects her coup detat
her shkipetari are forever flaying
emilios serbs and what thalia wants
to do now is to get out there and per-
suade the chieftains of the clans to
keep the peace for another ix months
you see failing to persuade her to as-
sist in their plans emilio might try to
stir up a fight between his faction and
hers and as the fighting would be along
the servian frontier even that might
give servia a pretext for interference
although it is really turkeys job
you make my head swim said
dallas but if the princess is so anx-
ious to hold in her hairy mountaineers
what is she doing here in france
ah now here we come to another
complication did you notice that very
pretty maid who took the girls peignoir
when she went into the water

  i did

  sir james leaned toward his friend
and dropped his voice she is the
countess rubitzki

  indeed it struck me that she was
rather classy for a maid and who is
the countess rubitzki  upon my
word i feel very common in this
crowd

  she is polish and all her family are
rampant nihilists they have been
mixed up in bloodthirsty plots to
slaughter every monarch in europe-
and she herself has been more or less
implicated

  really a nice young person to be
trailing around with your inamorata

  the lady thalia met her a good
many years ago in pesth and they have
always been bosom friends just now
her father and brother are in hiding
and there are extradition papers for
the whole lot in almost every country
in europe when the chase got too
warm the countess went to thalia in
paris and since then has been living
with her disguised as her maid the
two have been spending the summer in
a quiet little place in normandy where
the prince and rosenthal discovered
them rosenthal immediately recog-
nized the countess and is now using
this knowledge to coerce the lady tha-
lia the poor girl is at her wits end
they have tried twice to give rosen-
thal the slip but the big jew seems
to have second-sight what she wants
to do now is to run away and get back
to novibazar

  i see and she has persuaded you
to take the oath of allegiance and help
her carry out her plans

  quite so replied sir james calmly
i have taken it for both of us

  for me too how kind of you
dont be disagreeable stephen it
will be no end of a lark and just
think of those two lovely girls hounded
about from place to place by these two
semicivilized bounders

  are you trying to make me cry
all it means said sir james ig-
noring the irony of his friend is a
night run to paris once there they
will want to keep out of sight for a
few days so i told her that you would
no doubt be very glad to put your apart-
ment at their disposal you can come
and stop with me at the studio
infatuated insular ass was the
polite comment of the american

 um-ah sir james spun his
monocle about his finger if you
really must be nasty about it old chap
i will give them the studio and go and
stop with you

  are you sure that you would be
a pcrincess of the balkans

ii

comfortable james inquired dallas
solicitously

  it would be only for a day or two
then we can take your car and the
two girls and make a run for fiume
via switzerland the simplon and ven-
ice at fiume we would get a steamer
for cettinje and then overland for-
for-what the deuce is the name of that
blooming country

  novibazar oh this is so sudden
we will start said sir james plac-
idly to-night rosenthal and the
prince have retired as soon as you
can get your car ready the gargon will
bring down the ladies things i have
arranged everything all that you have
got to do is to drive the car

  and pay the bills

  dont be vulgar stephen you
have often complained to me about hav-
ing had to lie awake nights worrying
over what to do with your surplus in-
come really old chap you astonish
me

  i beg your pardon pray go on
it cant be much over two hundred
kilometers to paris from this place
fact is nothing could be jollier than
a fast run on a lovely moonlight night
like this

  unless perhaps to feel that we
were performing a disinterested and
unselfish act said dallas in his dryest
voice

  jus so agreed sir james with his
usual cheer

  dallas lit a cigarette and blew the
smoke meditatively upward

  look here james said he this
all sounds like a lovely lark ill admit
the ladies are very pretty and the
prince a miserable coward but i rather
like old rosenthal and hate to play
him a scurvy trick besides the whole
affair is distinctively none of our busi-
ness

  ah but you forget old chap that
ive already agreed for you you see
youre pledged-in a manner of speak-

ing why bless my soul those two
girls are packing up their things now
dallas sighed deeply then turned to
his friend with an air of weary resig-
nation

  oh very well then come on don
quixote iil run them as far as paris
but ill be hanged if ill give up my
apartment tell armand to get the car
ready at once i will go up and pack
a few minutes later as the two
friends walked across the court to
where the big high-powered car was
garaged they were met by dallas
mecanicien an alert intelligent french
youth

  do not strike a match messieurs
said he in a low voice some careless
idiot has upset a bid on of essence and
the place is flooded

  i should say it was growled dal-
las sniffing the reek of petrol who
did that

  it must have been the chauffeur of 
the prince said the man we had
better push the car out of the court
before starting the motor or lighting
the lamps the gargon will lend us a
hand

  very quietly the four men rolled the
big car out upon the road a full moon
was blazing down from the zenith and
the sea lay sparkling and flashing in its
brilliant light

  i wonder whispered dallas what
the fellow was doing with essence at
this time of night

  nobody answered and a moment
later two figures closely veiled and
followed by the gargon carrying two
big valises emerged from the back door
of the inn and approached the car
dallas who had seated himself and
was examining his levers merely
touched his cap sir james stepped
forward and helped the ladies into the
tonneau where he proceeded to tuck
them up with great care glancing over
his shoulder dallas observed the face
of the countess and was struck by its


the popular magazine

singular beauty and the classic purity
of feature

  nihilist-rubbish he thought to
himself she looks more like a school-
girl cant be more than twenty at the
outside he leaned forward and ad-
dressed his mecanicien crank the
motor and get in said he we will
stop down the road to light the lamps
the man obeyed the hotel menials
who saw in the whole performance
merely an adventure of gallantry
stepped back and touched their caps
sir james took the seat at dallas side
and the mecanicien seated himself upon
the floor dallas let in the clutch and
they glided out upon the gleaming road

 a kilometer from the hotel he
brought the car to a stop

  light up said he to the mecani-
cien then twisting about in his seat
looked at the lady thalia and smiled

  now just where is it that you wish
me to take you he asked dryly
what particular part of novibazar
through her chiffon veil he caught
the answering gleam of the girls white
teeth

  dakabar if you please she an-
swered without a moments hesitation
that is up on a plateau of the north
albanian alps

  precisely perhaps we had better
stop for a bite in paris then dejeuner
at munich and dinner at buda-pesth
from there on it will be a nice moon-
light spin across the plains of hungary
to belgrade

  the two girls laughed the lady
thalia in her throaty low-pitched con-
tralto and her companion in a deli-
ciously clear and contagious higher
note dallas observed that when she
laughed she threw back her head her
very blue eyes-which looked black in
the moonlight-almost closed and her
pretty lips curved upward like the
mouth of a bacchante

  i have not yet presented you to my
fellow prisoner said the lady thalia

countess rubitzki mr dallas and
sir james fenwick

  the two men bowed

  for the next three kilometers until
we strike the big dieppe-paris route
said dallas the road is a bit rough
i hope he continued looking at the
countess with mock anxiety that
countess rubitzki does not happen to
have any-er-bombs among her per-
sonal effects	

  the polish lady elevated her pretty
nose the classic character of which
was slightly marred or improved ac-
cording to the taste of the observer
by the suspicion of a tilt her rather
wide mouth-anglo-saxon in its firm-
ness though oriental in its softer sen-
sibilities-became a trifle haughty

  if monsieur is afraid said she
he had better take me back to the
hotel there are a great many things
more dangerous than bombs

  i well believe you said dallas
my word i dont see why you should
need to bother with explosives i am
sure no sovereign would refuse to ab-
dicate if you were to ask him real
prettily to do so tell me are you
really blacklisted

  so rosenthal has told us said the
lady thalia

  never you mind said sir james
comfortingly once out in the bal-
kans you can lie doggo for a few
months and the whole thing will blow
over then you can promise to be
good and we will see what we can do
the mecanicien had lit the lamps
and the powerful reflectors were rival-
ing the moonlight in their vivid twin
beams

  everything is ready msieu said
the man wiping his hands

  very well said dallas get in
he started ahead and the conversation
was for the moment interrupted

  proceeding at as fast a pace as the
character of the road would permit
they presently turned into the big paris-
a tptrlncess of the balkans



dieppe highway where dallas began
to raise his speed until presently the
monster bearing them appeared to be
rushing through the shimmering night
like a planet torn from its orbit on
either side the tall poplar trunks tore
past like the palings of a fence while
the gleaming road before them sug-
gested a broad band of flashing white
ribbon which was being flicked into the
wheels as a tape snaps into the roll of
the tape measure higher mounted the
speed and still higher the route was
perfect free of traffic and brilliantly
lighted while the damp night air
seemed to combine with the fuel to give
the highest explosive power in the six
smoothly running cylinders

  neither of the women in the tonneau
had ever experienced such speed which
terrific as it was became still more in-
tensified by the vague illusiveness of
their moonlit surroundings breathless
and giddy they clung to the sides of
the tonneau as the flying car tore up
the short kilometers and flung them
astern dallas a brilliant driver and
a hopeless speed maniac was begin-
ning to feel the deep encompassing re-
pose of soul with which such a pace
always enveloped his nervous disposi-
tion and sir james was mentally con-
jecturing on which particular star he
would strike should anything go wrong
when suddenly the tense vibrant hum
of the spinning mechanism began to
drop in tone deeper and deeper it
grew the fierce bufferings of air di-
minished in their force dallas
squirmed in his seat and turned a star-
tled face to his mecanicien who flashed
his pocket lamp upon the oil cups
then as they were breasting a gentle
slope the cylinders began to miss the
nfotor stopped the terrific momentum
was quickly lost the car slowed ar-
rested its wild course with a whine of
entreaty when dallas flung on his
brakes and sat in speechless anger star-
ing at his man

chapter iii

 nom de dieu gasped dallas
no essence

  impossible msieu cried the
mecanicien i filled the tanks this
afternoon

 then there must be a leak
snarled dallas pale and furious it
was the escaping essence which we
smelled in the garage

  that cannot be msieu the tank
and piping are new the essence in
the garage came from an overturned
bidon i found it myself still with

the essence-

  then what the devil is it i tell
you that there is no essence

  he leaped down upon the road sir
james did likewise and the mecanicien
produced a measure a hasty exami-
nation showed that the tank was empty

  it is just as i said snarled dallas
furious more at the sudden and unex-
pected relaxation from his high nerv-
ous exhilaration than at the predica-
ment in which they found themslves
get out of the way he himself ex-
amined the drip cock before the meca-
nicien could touch it the tap was
firmly closed

  then it must be a leak he growled
impossible msieu protested the
unhappy man

  then what is it

  the mecanicien pulled off his cap and
scratched his head his birdlike face
betrayed a growing suspicion

if some one at the hotel could have

stolen our essence- he began then

broke out explosively but the garage
was locked no one could have got
in but that camel of a chauffeur of
the prince

 urn ah observed sir james
pensively dallas face was torn be-
tween rage and doubt

  i have heard of such things he
muttered what sort of a pig was
he armand


the cpopulicr magazine

  i think that he was hungarian
msieu and a big ugly brute of a fel-
low he was not at all amiable

  what a beastly low trick said sir
james calmly to leave us stranded for
a few francs worth of petrol

  dallas compressed his lips and held
his peace he was far too enraged to
express himself appropriately with
ladies in the tonneau the latter had
made no comment but sat awaiting de-
velopments in the bewildered silence
peculiar to passengers when things go
wrong with the motor

  they had stopped on a deserted sec-
tion of the road so far as one could
discover across the bleak rolling hills
a light or two sparkled from some
farmhouse but there was no sign of
town or village although they were
on the highway it was very possible
that they might have to wait for some
time before another motor car should
pass as in france automobiling at night
is not the popular pastime it is in amer-
ica where so many men are engaged
in business affairs throughout the day

  in the glare of the lamps dallas
consulted his road map and discovered
that there was a village about three
kilometers ahead of them he turned
to his mecanicien

  you will have to walk to this place
saint croix armand said he you
will certainly find petrol there get
a few bidons and then secure a car-
riage and return as quickly as you can
if a car arrives in the meantime we
will try to borrow enough to go after
you

  the mecanicien hurried off and dal-
las turned to the ladies

  this is very annoying said he but
it ought not to delay us for very long
it looks as if some scoundrel possibly
that animal of the prince emilio has
stolen our petrol it seems to be my
unfortunate destiny to try to rescue the
lady thalia in boats without oars and
motor cars without fuel

  it is not your fault replied the
girl the night is lovely and we are
so happy to have made our escape from
emilio and that dreadful rosenthal
that the delay does not matter i am
only sorry to make you so much trou-
ble

  the moonlight is delicious mur-
mured the polish lady who had pushed
up her lunettes

  i say observed sir james who
being young and british turned natu-
rally to physical effort as a means of
killing time wouldnt you like to get
out and stretch your-um-ah-take a
little stroll 

  yes said dallas with irony
youve had no exercise to-day barring
an hours swim and shifting half the
water in the channel

  nevertheless said the lady tha-
lia i should love a little walk

  and i said the countess a ciga-
rette

  sir james threw open the door of
the tonneau and handed out the lady
thalia as if she had been a creation
of moon webs and spun glass

  we will walk down the road a bit
stephen said he if anything hap-
pens blow your horn

  dallas grunted and pulling out his
cigarette case offered it to the countess
then struck a match and was forced to
admire the glow of the flame against
the girls fresh lovely features she
threw back her head and blew the
smoke slowly into the face of the out-
raged moon

  tell me said she do you really
mean to take us all the way to tur-
key 

  turkey

  yes novibazar-that is a turkish
sanjak you know although under
austrian administration

  i didnt know do you want me
to take you there he leaned both
elbows on the rim of the tonneau and
looked at her curiously
a pcrincbss of the balkans



  of course we want you to but i
dont know of any reason why you
should

  nor i said dallas with an utter
absence of undue gallantry but i
can think of a good many why i should
not

  the countess laughed and glanced
at him from under the corners of her
long dark eyelashes

  all this is sir james doing is it
not she asked

  entirely i am merely the deus ex
ma china

  what is that

  at present a helpless god let us
say cupid with his wings clipped
you hate to stop on the road do
you not

  yes dont you 

  n-no

  excuse me but you see when i
start to do a thing i like to finish it
without a break dont you

  yes but then you see i was not
doing anything-except being fright-
ened nearly to death

  at what pray

  the speed you are a very daring
driver mr dallas one feels utter
confidence but at the same time the
mere pace is terrifying

  but a nihilist should not be fright-
ened at anything

  zut the countess struck the side
of the car sharply with her small hand
but i am not really a nihilist mr
dallas i am merely the victim of cir-
cumstance really i would rather be
killed myself than to hurt any living
thing

  there was an earnest note in the
girls voice that caused dallas to glance
at her keenly

 then why-

  because-oh i could never make
you understand

  try said dallas gently

  its difficult you are american

i am polish you grew up in an at-
mosphere of liberty in thought and
speech and action and i in one of op-
pression i was taught that the assas-
sination of despots was fine and noble
all my family lived in a mesh of in-
trigue and some-her breath came
quickly-have paid the penalty but
when i grew older i began to feel that
it was all so cruel i am weak per-
haps but i cannot plot to kill people
her voice grew plaintive i do not
want suffering nor to cause it i want
sunshine and flowers and sweetness

and-

  and love said dallas quietly

  the countess looked up at the moon
perhaps i dont know much about
the latter but it sounds rather nice
she laughed

  dallas regarded her thoughtfully
you have about as much right to be
a nihilist as i have said he in his dry
voice what you really need is a hus-
band and in the course of time a--
ahem-family then you would not
have time to think of blowing anybody
up unless it were the cook and you
couldnt do that or shed leave tell
me if you were to get out of this mess
would you cut the whole thing for the
future

  yes whispered the countess
  promise 

  oh yes but why

  because if youll promise i will
agree to see you safely to novibazar
mr dallas

  yes you are much too nice to be
mixed up with a bloodthirsty gang of
murderers or to be in the clutches of
men like the prince and rosenthal
the countess dropped her hand upon
his arm as it rested on the rim of the
tonneau her eyes looked deep into
his and something in their expression
or perhaps it was the magic of her
touch sent a thrill through the young
man dallas could be outwardly as
unmoved as an iroquois when his


the popular magazine

whole sensitive inner nature was warm
with the impulse of the moment

  that is very sweet of you said
the girl softly but it is asking far too
much

  you havent asked it it was
james we will say that it is for the
sake of the lady thalia

  but i dont want to say that it is all
for thalia i want just a little of it
to be for me

  then it is for you

  but why

  because-oh because i am an al-
trurian and a reformer of young ladies
with nihilistic tendencies and feel sorry
for the poor kings

the countess slightly raised her chin
i had hoped that it might be some-
thing more-chiv-er-roman-er-
interesting and what is an altrurian
mr dallas

  an altrurian is a person who does
for nothing what most people want to
be paid for

  oh the countess regarded him
thoughtfully and you are that sort
of person

  in moments of folly and when
under the influence of-james

  then you consider this a moment
of folly

  worse dallas looked deep into
her eyes it is a moment of mad-
ness 

  the countess dropped her elbows on
the rim of the seat rested her pretty
chin on the knuckles of one hand and
regarded the young man fixedly her
lovely face was filled with the softest
of shadows and her deep blue eyes
shone like stars after the moon has set

  but you dont want any pay said
she

  not for myself only for you-
and the poor devils of kings

  why are you so sorry for the
wretched kings

  id be sorry for anybody so unfor-
tunate as to be in your bad graces

then a person in grave danger is al-
  ways a fit object for compassion
  and how about a person in my good
  graces  asked the countess mischie-
  vously

  that said dallas would be more
  dangerous still

  indeed

  i think so what if you happened
  to get jealous-with your knowledge
  of unpleasant explosives

  you are chaffing me

  not a bit of it i shouldnt dare
  the countess tossed her head for
  a man who drives a car as you do it
  seems to me that you are singularly
  lacking in courage

  ah but you see you cant drive
  a woman

  would you be afraid to try
  very one always goes around in
  such a small circle that it is impossible
  to tell who is in the lead

  ignorance observed the countess
  to the moon is sometimes said to be
  bliss

  very likely-while it lasts
  coward

  guilty

  but in spite of your craven fears
  here you are knight errant

  that is james fault

  then it stops at paris said the
  countess with decision

  just as you wish

  what is your wish

  to be of service-dallas smiled-
  and to reform you from the evil of
  your ways

 but-why

   i have told you call it altruism
  im afraid said the girl slowly
  that it is pure kindness of heart and
  must cease at paris

  very well

 what

  i said very well 

  the countess leaned back in the ton-
  neau and folded her hands in her lap
  have a cigarette  said dallas
a tptrlncess of the balkans



offering his case she took one lighted
it then glanced at the moon that
treacherous counselor and lenient vise-
mouthed chaperon

  still said the countess presently
in a meditative voice i dont suppose
i ought to be selfish theres thalia--
and sir james

  quite so said dallas dryly

  the girl beat a little tattoo on the
back of the seat with her gloved fingers
then looked at dallas aslant

  it would be a lark said she do
you really want to take us

  yes i have already undertaken to
see you safely out of your troubles
but remember its a bargain do you
promise to reform

  yes murmured the countess i
promise oh you americans she
turned suddenly and flung herself
against the rim of the tonneau her face
very near that of the young man i
beg your pardon said she softly i
should have said-you american 
dallas took her hand in his strong
nervous grip and gave it a slight
squeeze

  then its agreed said he

  its agreed oh look here comes
a car 

  the young man turned and looked
back over the road upon which they
had come far in the distance he
caught the sudden flare of a search-
light at the same moment the cheer-
ful voice of sir james hailed him from
the gloom ahead

  i say stephen here comes a car

  i see it said dallas we will
stop them and try to beg a little es-
sence

  with painstaking care the english-
man placed the lady thalia in the ton-
neau we saw that fellows lights
said he and hurried back

  far down the road there appeared
another vivid flash then two lurid eyes
as the car swung around a slight curve
apparently it was high-powered for

ca

on striking the foot of the slope upon
which dallas had stopped it came fly-
ing up with no change of speed a
moment later dallas car fell within the
beams of the twin lights when there
came the sound of shifting gears as the
new arrival a big limousine car glided
gently alongside and came to a stop
at the same moment there reached the
ears of the runaways a harsh discord-
ant lugh

  rosenthal cried the countess

  sir james flicked away his cigarette
i say old chap he drawled to dal-
las i believe that weve been had
three dark figures descended from
the car and two of them approached
rosenthal was in advance looming
dark and titanesque at his elbow
came the chauffeur and dallas quick
eye caught the flash of some metallic
object in the mans hand the prince
remained standing by the door of the
limousine

  lookslike a row muttered sir
james go slow stephen remember
that we are in france

  as the big jew approached his rau-
cous laugh burst out again then ob-
serving the silent and ominous atti-
tudes of the two young men he
stopped

  goot efening said he in thick
guttural english he took off his hat
with a flourish excuse me if i laugh
but this is so very very funny veil
veil boys vill be boys is it not

  a deep chuckle rumbled in his chest
i must say that i fail to see any-
thing funny about it snapped dallas
we invite two ladies to take a moon-
light ride and then get stalled on a
lonely stretch of road because some
thief has stolen all the essence out of
our tank

  no cried rosenthal in a tone of
mock surprise

  you might let us have enough to
go on with you know suggested sir
james placidly


the popular magazine

  the big jews laugh gurgled deeper
goot said he be a sport as they
say in the states after all it vould
be no more than fair if ve vere to give
you some petrol-because it is yours
that we are now burning in our motor
ha ha ha

  ours snarled dallas have you
got the cheek to tell me that you stole
my essence  he took a step forward
sir james lounged easily at his elbow
his hands in the pockets of his ulster

  hold on  the jew raised one big
arm and shook his finger at the two
men dont do anyting foolish my
dear boys let me state my case you
made a little plot to steal avay our
ladies that vas all right i do not
blame you i vas once a youngster
minesellef but now i have a vife in
buda-pesth whom i lofe very much

  oh rot snapped dallas

  that is not polite mr dallas
remonstrated rosenthal but no mat-
ter when you made this little plan
you did not appreciate two tings
feerst who those ladies vere and sec-
ond that you vas playing the game mit
isidor rosenthal he smote his chest
with one big hand

  the game is not yet played out my
dear baron murmured sir james

  i beg your pardon sir chames
again he shook his finger at the two
men but do not try anyting rash
because i could take one of you boys
in each hand and cr-r-rack your heads
together the harsh voice had be-
come stem and menacing more than
that the prince has a revolver and
vould i am afraid be fool enough to
shoot it at you then here is the
mecanicien mit a spanner it is no
goot it is not vorth while besides
there is someting more you do not
know about this ladys maid of the lady
thalia

  yes said dallas impatiently we
know all about her she is the countess
rubitzki and said to be a nihilist

  she is a nihilist said rosenthal

  bosh said the englishman

  it is no bosh sir chames there
are extradition papers out for her in
france and italy and austria if she
is taken she goes to siberia

  it makes no difference retorted
dallas maid or nihilist or countess
she is our guest and she is not to be
interfered with

  by chingo exclaimed the jew
but that is goot spirit belief me i
am sorry to spoil this little spree but
business is business and there is that
matter of my forty tousand pounds
come my friends ve do not vant a
row you must see that you are out-
classed mein gott he exclaimed in
vexation who are you boys to pit
your brains and bodies against isidor
rosenthal i have made rebellions in
south america and the balkans and
all the west indies takes off its hat to
me  i have put presidents on their
trones and outfinanced statesmen and
received the tanks of potentates
come ve vill not have any troubles
you vould not be so foolish he
turned and said a few sharp words to
the chauffeur whereat the man walked
back to the car and put away the span-
ner rosenthal turned again to dallas
and threw out his hands palms upward
so you see my dear boys i play big
games and i play little ones too
i knew you vould try to steal the lady
thalia it had to be-after sir chames
went valking mit her on the beach so
not to make a r-row by the hotel and
because ve needed some fuel i ordered
our man to draw the essence from your
tank and put it into ours there vas
forty liters which at thirty-five cen-
times makes fourteen francs i vill
gif you the money

  he drew his purse from his pocket
counted out some silver and offered it
to dallas

  i dont want your filthy money
growled the american
a princess of the balkans	

  take it my friend business is
business rosenthal stepped to the
car and put the money on the seat
then turning he brushed past sir
james and laid his hand on the latch
of the door to the tonneau come
ladies said he

  but it was just here that rosenthal
hardened adventurer and keen judge of
men that he was committed a faux
pas accustomed all his life to carry-
ing his wishes through by the sheer
weight of his tremendous vitality he
would not admit the possibility of any
active resistance to his will but in all
his rough dealings with men the jew
had never had much contact of a hos-
tile character with thoroughbreds  as
he truthfully said he was physically
powerful enough to take the two young
men one in either hand and knock
their heads together and this and the
fact that they were unarmed and ap-
parently at a loss seemed to him quite
enough to insure his carrying off the
affair high-handedly

  but the big jew had quite failed to
consider the fact that there is a certain
type of man who under given condi-
tions will fight to the last not through
any hope of winning out but merely
because he feels that he owes it to
himself

  both dallas and sir james belonged
to this - class the englishman had
been standing with his feet apart and
his thumbs hooked into the side pockets
of his ulster his cap was pulled down
over his eyes and his face looked calm
and unruffled but as the jew stepped
forward and laid his hand upon the
latch sir james swung easily about
taking the weight of his athletic body
on his  forward foot

  oh look here baron said he in
a voice of calmest protest this wont
do at all we cant have you making
free with our guests like that you
know suppose you take your hand
off that door

  sir chames said rosenthal in his
harsh voice i am very sorry but these
ladies are in our care and they must
come with us

  his great hand fell on the latch and
as it did so sir james fist shot out
so quick was the blow and so true and
hard that it would have been all that
was necessary to stretch the ordinary
man upon the toad but rosenthal
was very far from being the ordinary
man although confident that he would
meet with no resistance yet as the vet-
eran of many a swift and deadly melee
where knives and pistols were used as
well as fists he was not caught alto-
gether napping the indolent shifting
of the englishmans weight had not
been lost to his practiced eye so that
when sir james struck out rosenthal
although he had no time to evade the
blow slightly tirned his head with the
result that what would otherwise have
been a solid impact glanced from the
heavy bones under his woolen cap

  seeing that he had failed the eng-
lishman sprang in and struck with his
other fist but this blow was knocked
aside by rosenthals arm and the next
instant the two had clinched

  dallas who fully understood his
friends nature was quite prepared
as sir james grappled with rosenthal
dallas sprang upon the prince and be-
fore that startled royalty could snatch
his revolver from his pocket he re-
ceived a blow between the eyes that
sent him over backward and to the
ground his head striking the step as
he fell the mecanicien taking it for
granted from the assurance of rosen-
thal and the quiet demeanor of the two
young men that there would be no vio-
lence was also taken unprepared be-
fore he could secure his spanner dal-
las had sprung upon him and struck
him in the face with a force that sent
him spinning in his tracks but the
american although strong and quick
was light of build while the chauffeur


the popular magazine

was a thickset powerful man recov-
ering himself he sprang at dallas and
the two went to the ground together in
a very active rough-and-tumble

  the prince half stunned from the
rap which he had given his head as he
fell remained quite hors de combat so
that the fight was man to man but
sir james although a splendid athlete
was no match for the herculean jew
rosenthal tore him off as a gorilla
might free himself from the clasp of
a man and getting one great arm clear
smote the englishman a hammerlike
blow on the top of the head which laid
him senseless and quivering in the road
then ignoring the struggle going on
between dallas and the chauffeur he
flung open the door of the tonneau and
plucking out the countess as if she were
a child carried her to the princes car
and pushed her into the limousine

  keep quiet paula he panted
remember if there is any alarm-
siberia

  pie strode back to dallas car
come thalia said he do not
oblige me to use force come

  without a word the girl descended
from the car but catching sight of
sir james she paused

  you brute she cried chokingly
have you killed him 

  nonsense it is nodding panted
the jew he is yust asleep i took
care to hit him on top of the head and
not too hard or his skull vould be
c-c-crushed like an eggshell i do not
like to kill a gentleman they are too
few sapristi he vould fight vat
could i do  come 

  he pushed the girl toward the other
car into which she crept without a
word when rosenthal turned and
secured the two valises the chauffeur
had overcome dallas who was lying
on his back cursing vigorously while
the man sat upon his chest pinning
both his wrists to the ground the
prince had struggled to a sitting pos-

ture with his back against the wheel
and was holding both hands to his head
and groaning as rosenthals eyes fell
upon him the jews face was lit for a
moment by his sardonic grin leaning
down he raised the prince bodily by
both shoulders and thrust him into the
limousine

  get in my dear fellow said he
and slammed the door he turned to
where dallas was lying on his back in
the road under the weight of the burly
mecanicien and his deep chuckle rum-
bled out again

  vill you be good if you are let up
and not try to fight asked rosenthal

  dallas reply was a somewhat torrid
blast in the expressive terms of his
native city chicago

  pestet exclaimed the jew all
this fuss for some br-r-ight eyes  such
foolish boys with me it is different
it is a matter of forty tousand pounds
ary can you not be sensible his
harsh voice carried a note that was
almost plaintive here we are fighting
with r-r-rage in our hearts and yester-
day ve might have been all drowned
together

  furious as he was something in the
tone of the big jew struck dallas sense
of the ridiculous in spite of himself
he began to laugh rosenthals harsh
cackle joined him

  that is better-to laugh come
get up he hauled the chauffeur
roughly off dallas who rose to his feet
shook himself eyed his big antagonist
for a moment then shrugged

  where is sir james he demanded
looking around

  over there he is hurted a little
-not much he jerked his head to-
ward the englishman who was begin-
ning to stir rosenthal turned away

  good night mr dallas said he
affably then in french to the meca-
nicien get in and drive

  dallas walked stiffly to the side of
his prostrate friend the mecanicien
a princess of the balkans



climbed to his feet cranked the motor
and took his seat rosenthal glanced
at sir james then got in beside the
chauffeur

  good night called the jew again
good night answered dallas in
spite of himself

  the big car moved forward as it
gathered speed and glided off into the
darkness dallas heard the jews harsh
laugh scarcely distinguishable from
the clash of the pinions as the chauffeur
went somewhat awkwardly into the
speed ahead with a wry smile the
young man turned to look at his friend
at the same moment sir james sat
upright

  ouch said he

  how do you feel james asked
dallas

 little groggy i say- his

wits scattered by the crushing force of
rosenthals big fist rallied quickly he
looked somewhat vacantly about him
then groaned

  very bad james

  oh i say stephen sir james
two hands were raised to clasp his
head weve been had 

  couldnt help it muttered dallas
we did our little best

  how did you make out

  nothing to brag of i did put the
prince out of action then the chauf-
feur sat on me

 the chauffeur oh come not
the chauffeur

  rather it were he than the prince
-or even rosenthal snapped dallas
oh my soul and our ladies 
theyve got em

  oh no no stephen stephen
this is too awful

  dont blame me snapped dallas
you started the donnybrook

  i know it but-to get polished
off and our ladies taken away from us
by an outfit like that let me die
sir james groaned then sat up with a

feeble grin did you say you had

some brandy in the car

  dallas produced the stimulant of
which both partook

  i thought i heard somebody laugh-
ing as i was wraking up from my nap
observed sir james

  very likely rosenthal was laugh-
ing and so was i just think it over
a bit and perhaps the humor of the
thing may strike you

  sir james cackled feebly downy
old bird rosenthal said he to
think of his having foreseen the whole
thing and drained all of the essence
out of our tank except just enough
to take us into the wilderness hope
we meet again

  i have an idea said dallas softly
that we will

  where pray

  that i dont know but this ad-
venture james has only just begun
sir james face brightened i wish
that i could think so said he

  well its so let me tell you some-
thing about two minutes before ro-
senthal arrived on the scene i had
passed my word to countess rubitzki
to see the two girls safely to novi-
bazar

  the deuce you had

  yes i had agreed to get them
safely away from rosenthal and the
prince and deposit them in the lady
thalias country wherever that is
what i meant to do of course was
to make a run to the eastward in the
car and even while i was talking to
her i had figured it all out my plan
was to stop in paris for a few hours
sleep and to get some things and then
before rosenthal and the prince could
arrive to get away for switzerland
go over the simplon and then on
through italy and the dolomites for
the dalmatian coast eventually escort-
ing them across montenegro as we
had planned now the whole thing has


the cpocpullcr magazine

got complicated-but theres my prom-
ise just the same

  sir james scrambled to his feet and
seized his friends hand

  thats the talk old fellow he ex-
claimed you can count on me be-
sides-he rubbed his head-we cant
decently drop the thing after being
mauled about like this and i say dal-
las did you ever see such eyes

  no said dallas nor such a mouth
and chin and she is no more a nihilist
at heart than i am she has simply
got mixed up in all this trouble through
the fault of circumstance she is the
sweetest little person that ever lived
and so game upon my word james
i caught a glimpse of her as that hairy
brute was stuffing her into the limou-
sine and her cigarette was still going

  i say exclaimed sir james you
are talking about the countess  was
referring to thalia

  thalia exclaimed dallas oh
you can have thalia

  wish i thought so anyhow well
have a try eh sir james raised the
flask which he held in his hand its
a go then old boy heres confusion
to rosenthal and the prince and long
live thalia and the countess and-and
-what is the name of their bally coun-
try 

  novibazar

  long live novibazar

  the two friends drank

  here comes a wagon said dallas
as he set down the flask he raised
his voice armand 

  me voila msien came the distant
answer

chapter iv

  the question is observed sir
james the following day as the two
were at dejeuner in dallas luxurious
apartment on the avenue de lalma
how to find em again

  that should not be hard said dal-

las rosenthal is too conspicuous a
figure to lose himself in paris

  look here- said sir james tell
you what ill do i know a south
american woman here in paris who is
acquainted with all the unusual peo-
ple her salon is usually full of ori-
ental nabobs and abdicating presidents
and nihilists and shady balkan royalties
and that sort of truck she is senora
gonzales of buenos aires got a card
from her the other day she comes
back to town early to see something of
the south american and west indian
gang before they go home for the win-
ter suppose that i go around there
to see if i can learn anything about our
friends

  dallas nodded

  that is a good plan meanwhile i
will attend to a few matters and well
meet at the travelers for dinner
right said sir james then im
off

  returning to his studio he gave or-
ders to his manservant to get ready to
leave at a moments notice for a hunt-
ing trip in austria a few hours later
he presented himself at a small private
hotel upon the avenue henri martin
where on entering the salon he was
welcomed by a handsome woman of
andalusian type who greeted him very
cordially

  it is so nice of you to come sir
james said she you are just in
time there is such a fascinating girl
in the other room shes albanian
her father was constantine bey and
her home is high up in the north alba-
nian alps

  not the lady thalia exclaimed
sir james

  yes cried his hostess in surprise
do you know her

  uh-ah-weve met is the prince
emilio wtith her

  the prince is playing bridge
  indeed and speaking of the
a princess of the balkans



prince senora gonzales do you happen
to know a baron rosenthal

  oh everybody in south america
knows rosenthal such a type he
has promised to come in later

 what do you know about him
asked sir james

  rosenthal is a czechian jew who
has made an enormous fortune in pro-
moting all kinds of-er-doubtful en-
terprises principally revolutions in all
parts of the world he knows every-
body speaks every language after a
fashion and is a papal baron fancy
a jew a papal baron

  does that account for his being re-
ceived asked sir james i thought
him an aful brute

  his hostess threw out her hands
but nobody could keep rosenthal out
of any place where he wanted to go
she cried he is as insidious as the
cholera with the forward impetus of-
of-

  of an auto bus suggested sir
james reflectively

  madame gonzales laughed  see
that you have met him but then she
added i doubt if anybody would wish
to close the door to rosenthal he is
very interesting and would do anything
for a person whom he liked then he
is really very decent and well-behaved
and perfectly devoted to his wife

  sir james was on the point of pur-
suing his inquiries when some other
guests arrived and the hostess turned
from him with a smile

  he crossed the room and passed into
a salon adjoining where sitting in an
alcove and chatting with an immaculate
young frenchman he discovered the
lady thalia of novibazar

chapter v

  the lady thalia looked up and as
her eyes fell upon sir james they
opened to their fullest width and the
rich color faded from her cheeks the

next instant it came pouring back again
considerably deeper in tone while her
long lashes fell

  the man to whom she had been talk-
ing and who was looking into her face
at the time observed the flash of emo-
tion and swinging in his chair glanced
up curiously at sir james the two
were slightly acquainted having pre-
viously met at the same house sir
james crossed the room in his usual
calm and cheerful manner bowed be-
fore the girl then with a pleasant
word turned to shake hands with the
frenchman

  and how do you find yourself
mademoiselle said he in french
after our little accident of last even-
ing without waiting for her reply
and in order to give her the cue he
turned to the frenchman and con-
tinued  while motoring last night
with a friend we had the misfortune
to come in collision with the prince
emilio and baron rosenthal

  indeed and was there any dam-
age 

  none whatever to the cars replied
sir james placidly the prince my
friend and myself were thrown about
a little and slightly shaken up

  the lips of the lady thalia began
to twitch and the frenchman suspect-
ing some understanding between the
two murmured his felicitations on
their escape from serious injury and
with a comment on the dangers of mo-
toring excused himself

  when he had gone the girl leaned
back in her fauteuil and looked at sir
james smilingly

  awfully jolly finding you here
said sir james cheerfully saves such
a lot of trouble

  are you quite sure she answered
positive we had set ourselves to
comb paris to find you

  and now that you have found us
asked the girl

  we can make our plans answered


the cpopuljr magazine

sir james in his most matter-of-fact
tone

  indeed the hazel eyes opened a
little wider how is mr dallas
quite furious you see the chauf-
feur sat on him

  no

  really and im not quite sure
that the brute did not cuff him once
or twice stephen would not admit it
but i noticed that one ear was a trifle
puffed up and when he brushed his
hair he swore

  the lady thalia leaned back in her
chair and laughed until her eyes were
misty then her lovely face grew se-
rious

  and how are you she asked i
have been horribly anxious when we
left you were quite unconscious

  merely a little nap replied sir
james calmly the baron knows his
work when i awoke quite refreshed
i found dallas raving writh a thirst for
revenge and a deep appreciation for the
charms of a certain lady

  and you

 um-ah-my own emotions were
not so complicated i harbor no ill will
against rosenthal

  the girls eyes fell paula is very
fascinating is she not

  so stephen tells me no doubt he
is quite right

  the rich color deepened in the cheeks
of the lady thalia and her long lashes
swept down to hide what was in the
amber-colored eyes

  but about our plans said sir
james we have undertaken to get
you out of the hands of ihe prince and
rosenthal and land you safely in-ah

  novibazar

  quite so sir janies adjusted his
monocle and taking a small gold pencil
from his pocket scribbled something
upon his cuff the girls lips twitched

  we must give these chaps the slip
said sir james then well run you

two ladies down through switzerland
and across to the dalmatian coast get
into your country by the back door so
to speak

  the girls face became grave and
she shook her head

  that is very dear and chivalrous of
you said she but it is quite impos-
sible we are leaving in two days for
belgrade and rosenthal has threatened
to inform the police of paulas identity
if we try to run away in the meantime
it would not be safe

  sir james knit his brows and spun
his monocle around his finger

  besides said the lady thalia
slowly we could not think of letting
you put yourself to so much trouble
and expense

  as for the trouble said sir james
that doesnt count because yotx see
weve neither of us a blessed thing to
do and as far as expense is concerned
dallas swears that he would cheerfully
put up forty thousand pounds against
old rosenthals just to get even hes
shockingly rich what will happen
when you get to belgrade 

  the lady thalias face clouded i
have no idea she answered to tell
the truth the thought is a little terrify-
ing servia is a very wild country and
emilio has great influence there

  you mean that he might do some-
thing nasty 

  n-no rosenthal who is kind-
hearted in a way would see that no
actual harm happened us but i think
they are quite capable of keeping us
somewhere under guard until they have

either carried out their plans or-

the small white teeth came together

  or you have consented to marry
emilio 

  she nodded

  in that case said sir james we
will try to give them the slip at bel-
grade no dont interrupt please
the young mans pleasant voice had
grown suddenly crisp and his habitual
a princess of the balkans

indolent cheerfulness had disappeared
you dont quite understand lady
thalia the affair has ceased to be
a lark nor is it a matter of gallantry
dallas and i have made a promise not
only to you and paula rubitzki but to
ourselves we have been knocked
down and beaten and made fools of
and we cannot drop the undertaking
now with honor there is also of
course the desire to be of service to
you unless you forbid us which i
am sure you will not we mean to see
the thing through

  it is dangerous work sir james
you do not understand what you are
undertaking

  i understand enough and so does
dallas will you accept us as your
knights-errant  surely you will not re-
fuse now and go on and leave us dis-
graced 

  but you are not disgraced last
night you were outnumbered the odds
were too heavy and there are very few
men sir james who would care to
attack a giant like rosenthal there is
nothing for you to feel ashamed of and
besides-she slightly raised her chin-
i do not consider mere personal pride
to be enough of a motive for what you
wish to do

  it is not the only motive you see
dallas and i are mere idlers i paint
bad pictures and he plays with motors
we have often bewailed our lack of
objective now you are trying to do a
very fine thing and if you succeed in
getting away from these two animals
and out to your own country you are
going to try to prevent a border war
and to bring your country under the
control of a civilized administration
that is fine its splepdid if one
could do something like that one would
not feel such an unpardonably useless
member of society so you see stephen
and i would like to help if you dont
mind

  the lady thalia smiled

  you men are dears she said im-
pulsively in her soft accented english
paula and i should consider ourselves
very lucky to have found two such
friends come then if you wish she
held out her hand

  sir james took it quickly in his and
with his brick-red face slightly brickier
leaned over and brushed it with his lips
at the same moment there came from
the doorway behind him an explosive
sapristi followed by a hoarse gur-
gling chuckle he turned in his chair
and looked up into the sardonically
grinning face of baron isidor rosen-
thal

  mein gott cried the jew you
vas at it again he shook his great
head and his craggy satanic features
became suddenly grave my friend
this vill not do the prince is in the
other r-r-room playing bridge if he
finds you here there vill be a scene
his brown eyes shot with their mul-
tiple hazel dots grew somber i
should have hitted you harder he
growled

  mr dallas observed sir james
pleasantly should have hit the prince
harder by rights he ought to be in
bed with his face in a towel

  his face is not pretty said the jew
with a grin his eyes are very bad
we have told the people that we vas
in collision last night but you must
be careful sir chames

  suppose you go in and keep him
busy for a few minutes i will not be
long

  rosenthal hesitated for an instant
then his diabolic grin pushed up the
corners of his bushy eyebrows and
bared his great yellow fangs

  goot said he i vill do it-be-
cause you are a goot sport i like
you and i tink perhaps i owe you
someting but do not be long sir
chames i vant to show some stones
to mademoiselle-a tiamond and ruby
necklace i have yust bought for my
b

the poipulacr magazine

dear vife in buda-pesth he turned
and left the room

 sir james and the lady thalia
looked at each other and laughed

  we must make our plans quickly
said the young man you say that
you are going to leave for belgrade
the day after to-morrow

  the day after that-thursday
then stephen and i will go on
ahead of you as quickly as possible
we will take all our shooting things
and give it out on our arrival that we
are going up country after moufflon or
ibex or chamois or whatever they have
out there and we will travel under the
names of mr james and mr ste-
phen on arriving at belgrade we
will try to secure an intelligent native
servant in whom wte will confide as
much as seems necessary for the rest
we shall have to trust to opportunity
it ought not to be difficult-servia is
such a wild country

  again their eyes met at the same
moment there came from the other
room a burst of laughter and many
voices talking together with the sound
of chairs being pushed along the par-
quet

  they have stopped playing said
the girl breathlessly you must go
sir james rose to his feet then
looked down at her with a smile

  a bicntot said he softly at bel-
grade then

  he turned on his heel and strode out
of the room in the salon he came
face to face with rosenthal

  you are going asked the jew
that is goot the prince is a hot-
head

  is he he did not act that way last
night

  rosenthals yellow teeth shone be-
tween his mustache and his imperial

  it is different in a salon he said
he has no polish like you and me
he is a serb-half civilized-pouf
goot-by sir chames

  the englishman took the huge hand
which a few hours earlier had landed
closed and with crushing force upon
his aristocratic head

  good-by baron rosenthal said he
smiling

chapter vi

  three days later in their suite of
rooms from the windows of which one
looked out upon the palace where king
alexander and his queen draga were
murdered stephen dallas sir james
and connors the latters servant sat
calmly discussing their plans for the
abduction of the lady thalia and her
persecuted friend countess paula ru
bitzki

  scattered in some confusion about
the room were the arms and accouter-
ments of the sportsmen costumes of
canvas and khaki puttee leggings
heavy hobnailed hunting shoes car-
tridge belts camp gear of aluminum
flasks high-powered binoculars and
weapons with the last they had ex-
perienced no difficulty from the local
authorities one glance at sir james
brick-red face his monocle and the
faultless costumes of both men had
been sufficient passport the official
ones had not even been asked for sir
james was so obviously the ubiquitous
british sportsman to be found wher-
ever there are animals to kill and there
is no lack of game in the servian high-
lands moreover england is about the
only one of the powers held in esteem
by the servians despite or because of
the fact that only great britain with-
drew her minister and kept him with-
drawn after the bloodthirsty royal mas-
sacre which immediately preceded the
accession of king peter to the throne

  as dallas and sir james discussed
their plans the man connors was care-
fully studying a map which was spread
on the central table and as the two
friends talked they occasionally glanced
toward the irishman as if for confir-
a princess of the balkans



mation of their statements for con-
nors when the truth were known was
far better qualified for the work in hand
than either of the two being a veteran
campaigner with a large fund of per-
sonal experience where dealing with
savage peoples was concerned for
many years he had served as the or-
derly of sir james father the late
colonel sir henry fenwick and had
been through one campaign in india
and another in the sudan connors
was a silent man past middle age of an
iron physique resourceful highly cour-
ageous and possessed of a keen sense
of irish humor in appearance he was
of medium height very broad with a
lean frame and large heavy bones he
had of course been fully informed as
to the nature of the enterprise which
while it jumped entirely with his incli-
nation he nevertheless felt under obli-
gation outwardly to condemn

  there will be fightin sorr he had
said to dallas or im no judge i see
be the map that this same novibazar do
be a mountainous counthry and tis my
expayrience that where theres moun-
tains there do be paypul who wud
rather fight than ate an fightin is
bad in these days phwin kings talks
pace and their subjecs do be smug-
glin long-range rifles into the hills agin
the time phwin their naybors have laid
down their arrums

  but fighting is your proper trade
connors dallas had said

  troth sorr and so it is an shud
be sir james trade as well but where
theres wimmin mixed up wid it sorr
-he shook his grizzled head-fightin
is wan thing sorr an wimmin is an-
other an phwin the two is mixed tis
no great job a mon will be doin at
ayther-unless maybe tis wid the wim-
min

  having thus expressed himself the
irishman had set about to overhaul the
weapons with a loving care wthich was

scarcely consistent with his theoretic
disapproval of the undertaking

  the proprietor of their inconspicuous
hotel had promised to secure them a
proper guide who should be familiar
with the country and the local dialects
of its inhabitants as they were deep
in the discussion of their plans there
came a rap at the door and the german
waiter-for the serbs dislike menial
work of any kind-ushered into their
presence a swarthy-looking ruffian in a
sheepskin cap an upper garment of
white which was half shirt half smock
and white trousers very full about the
hips and fitting snugly about the legs
which were swathed in homespun
stockings with a broad red band on
his feet he wore rawhide sandals
thonged across the instep and about the
ankles he was not a prepossessing-
looking individual but appeared to be
clean and his face although sullen
showed an unmistakable intelligence

  dallas looked up sharply at which
the man pulled off his sheepskin cap

  goo morning sar said he with a
grin

  hm  said sir james so you
speak english

  yes sar i american citizen

  the deuce you are said dallas
yes sar i work three years in
slaughterhouse in new york city i

many get two dollars

  what do you do here asked sir
james

  raise hogs in beech woods over by
head of morava river

  do you know the country across the
border in the sanjak of novibazar
asked dallas the country in the
neighborhood of rascia

  the man threw him a quick cunning
glance

  yes sar know all that country
well my landlord live there he
prince emilio no good

  the two friends exchanged glances


the popular magazine

  whats the matter with him  asked
dallas

  he boss grafter sometime he make
me pay rent twice all his people very
bad got bands of bulgarian chris-
tians dont do a thing but cut throats
other christians

  are you a christian asked dallas

  me no i good man been to
new york out for the dough

  the christian  community ob-
served sir james does not appear to
stand particularly high i think this
man is what we need suppose we tell
him what do you think connors

  the irishman had been eying the
man keenly and did not appear to be
favorably impressed but he shrugged
his shoulders

  no doubt he knows the counthry
sorr an he looks to be a smart divil
enough

  ones as good as another james
said dallas in french its only a
question of money and we will pay
him well besides he doesnt like
emilio

  sir james nodded suppose you
tell him what we want then said he

  what are you doing in belgrade
dallas inquired

  jes come down with bunch of hogs
now they all shipped for vienna
pretty soon i go back

  did you ever hear of a place called
dakabar asked dallas

  the man scratched his matted head

  yes sar that high up in the moun-
tain people there all shkipetari they
tough gang dont like serbs his
beady eyes fastened keenly on dallas
you gointhere

  yes said dallas now listen to
me the prince emilio will be here
in belgrade to-morrow or next day
there are with him two ladies we
want to steal these two ladies and take
them to dakabar do you under-
stand

  the man looked at him keenly his

sullen face showed a quick flash of in-
telligence then became dull again

  that tough job

  you will be well paid

  how much you pay

  how much do you want

  the mans eyes narrowed and a
crease appeared across his low fore-
head

  this tough job said he sup-
pose prince he get wise there was a
significant gesture of his finger across
his swarthy throat this job no
cinch

  then you are afraid to tackle it
asked dallas

  no sar not afraid suppose you
pay good price-one hundred dollars
-he looked keenly at dallas with his
cunning beady eyes-then i fix it
all right i will pay you one hun-
dred dollars and when we get safely
to dakabar if you have done well i
will give you another fifty now what
do you think is the best way to go about
it

  the man pondered

  whats your name

  dimitri sar i think best way for
two ladies to take a drive some night
i give coachman fifty kroners keep his
mouth shut then we get ponies and
wait on the big road to nis then i
know crossroad through the hills by
rudnik that very long-four days
five days-but railroad not safe then
i think ladies better wear boy clothes
so nobody get wise

  dallas and sir james exchanged
glances

  all right dimitri said dallas
you appear to know your business
go ahead then and buy your horses
and the boys clothes for the ladies and
mind you get clean new ones until
we get well away from belgrade we
will push along pretty fast he said to
sir james

  spose you write note to ladies sar
a qxrincess of the balkans



said dimitri tell em go driving one
night very soon

  dallas picked up his portfolio and
wrote a few lines which he inclosed in
an envelope and handed to their guide

  all right said dimitri this tough
job this no cinch but i fix it

chapter vii

  high up on a little shelf of the wild
kapaonik mountains the runaways had
made their noonday halt at the cabin
of a shaggy swineherd whose pigs were
rooting in the beech wood which clothed
the flanks of the hill

  above the cabin the mountain reared
precipitously to a height of some six
thousand feet beneath the slope fell
away more gradually to a narrow
thickly wooded valley where the tum-
bling waters of the moravitza foamed
and roared and could be seen in places
flashing like snow through vistas be-
tween the trees the leaves of which
were beginning to show a tint of au-
tumn coloring

  the air was still and sweet with the
odors of moss and fern for it had
rained the night before and the hot
midday sun was now beating down to
distil the steaming earth in its own fra-
grance the soothing murmur of the
river arose in pulsing beats to the ears
of the travelers overhead the sky
was clear and blue and two eagles were
weaving spirals as they mounted to-
ward the zenith calling to each other in
clear and piercing notes

  immediately around the cabin itself
there was a little clearing which had
been planted in maize beyond this the
forest which grew thickly on three
sides while on the fourth rose the bare
precipitous shoulder of the mountain

  daintily perched oh a block of wood
the countess rubitzki attired in the
costume of a servian peasant boy blew
wreaths of smoke from her cigarette
and listened with a faint flush on her

soft cheeks to some argument advanced
by dallas who with his back against
a log was basking luxuriously in the
sunshine

  at a little distance sir james in
tweeds and puttees was mixing some
water with the strong native red wine
for the refreshment of the lady tha-
lia she was clad like the countess in
a long smock of -homespun wool caught
about the waist with a belt and falling
in a kilt which reached mid-thigh full
trousers of the same material and
heavy woolen stockings with rawhide
sandals laced across the ankle and half-
way up the leg both girls might easily
have passed as young european lads
who for comfort and convenience had
adopted the native costume their
abundant hair was entirely hidden by
their kalpaks or round caps fitting low
on the head and supplemented by scarfs
twisted turbanlike as though to prcn-
tect the back of the head against the
rays of the sun

  for three and a half days they had
pushed on rapidly journeying through
a wild and beautiful country sparsely
populated and for the greater part
forest-covered the abduction had
been skillfully managed by dimitri and
had been unmarred by the slightest
hitch returning from a banquet at
the palace their well-bribed coachman
had driven to a lonely spot on the out-
skirts of the city where their two cava-
liers were awaiting them the night
being fine they had ptit some thirty
miles between themselves and belgrade
before the sunrise when they had
stopped to rest at the lonely farmhouse
of a plum grower since then they
had traveled throughout the day and
stopped for the night wherever a shel-
ter presented itself

  to-morrow said sir james we
ought to get a glimpse of your hills
thalia pon my word ill be rather
sorry when we do this has been no
end of a lark


the vopulacr magazine

  the girl looked at him thoughtfully
then her eyes flitted across to where
dallas was sitting and a faint shadow
crossed her lovely face

  i shall be sorry too she answered
in a low voice

  what will you do when you get
there asked sir james

  i will call together the chiefs and
explain to them what emilio wants to
do and try to show them the necessity
of keeping the peace we shkipetari
are composed of different clans a good
deal like the scotch highlanders sir
james although most of my people
are mohammedans they are quite un-
like the turks whom they hate my
father was a bey and had a great deal
of authority he was once called to
constantinople by the sultan who did
him a great deal of honor and per-
suaded him to do what he could to stop
the incessant fighting and the attacks
that were always being made on the
turkish caracols or outposts i think
that they will listen to me and try to
keep their people quiet my father was
killed by a band of christians of the
bulgarian church and ever since there
has been a blood feud with the serbs
of emilios district

  i fancy your people are a pretty
bloodthirsty crowd observed sir
james

  they are savage thalia admitted
but they are straightforward and chiv-
alrous not treacherous like the serbs
a woman could go anywhere alone
through our hills with perfect safety
and so could a traveler whom they had
nothing against but there is no such
thing as law and order and-she
smiled-we settle our disputes in our
own way nobody ever tries to inter-
fere with the shkipetari

  sir james laughed and stretching
his long limbs luxuriously in the warm
sunshine lit a cigarette their lunch-
eon had been a hearty one as the day
before dallas a splendid shot had

killed a red deer far across a rocky
gorge through which their trail had
wound dimitris beady eyes had nar-
rowed at sight of the buck tumbling
down the bare hillside and the expres-
sion of the guides face had not been
lost on connors

   twas not the look a mon would
wear sorrs at sight of meat in camp
said the irishman later to sir james
and dallas he will stand a lot of
watchin this dimitri i cud see the
workins o the scalawags brain as plain
as ye see the innerds of a glass travel-
in clock thinks he ill take good
care that niver ye get the chance to
draw a bead on me 

  connors was unpacking a few deli-
cacies when sir james saw him stop in
the act of unbuckling a strap and shad-
ing his eyes with his hand stare up
at a ledge which almost overhung the
cabin

  what do you see connors he
called

  the irishman turned

  theres three chamois sorr wan a
buck just passed around that ledge of
rock beyant

  dallas a keen sportsman sprang to
his feet do you think i could get a
shot  he asked

yis sorr but tis a bit of a climb
dallas quickly entered the cabin to
emerge a moment later with his -
im going to have a try for the buck
said he

  may i go with you asked thalia
rising

  dallas glanced dubiously at the al-
most sheer face of the mountain

  its a rough climb

  im a hill woman

  all right come ahead then
dimitri hearing their voices had
come to the door of the hut and was
looking at dallas through narrowed
lids

  better not go sar said he we
start now pretty quick
a princess of the balkans



  dallas glanced at him in surprise
thought you said we shouldnt leave
for another hour said he

  that pass very quick when you
chase goats

  ill be back said dallas shortly
and had turned toward the mountain
when dimitri spoke again

  better stay here sar said he
this fella-he pointed at the goat-
herd who was giving some fodder to
the horses-he tell me we better start
right away to get across those hills be-
fore dark road very bad straight up
and straight down

  all right said dallas indifferently
i will be back by the time that you
are ready to start

  he turned away and dimitri scowled
and went back into the hut

  come on thalia said dallas if
you really want to go but its going to
be a hard climb

  the girl glanced at him and smiled
throughout their journey there had
been in her manner toward dallas a
hint of mockery which had rather puz-
zled the young man who had gradually
come to the conclusion that the alba-
nian lady was inclined to regard him as
a somewhat effete production of over-
civilization

  they started to climb in silence for
the first hundred feet the ascent pre-
sented no especial difficulties but a little
higher up they found themselves con-
fronted by sheer cliff seamed and
eroded and although quite surmount-
able to the experienced mountaineer
yet dangerous from its steepness

  dallas glanced up in some dismay
this job is not so easy as it looks
from down below said he youd
better not tackle it thalia

  she glanced into his flushed face with
her mocking little smile

  are you quite sure that you had
better tackle it yourself 

  i am not crazy about it-with this
rifle he admitted

  then give the rifle to me

  what nonsense

  then come ahead ill go first and
pick out our route she glanced at
him over her shoulder and smiled again
you see mr dallas this is my coun-
try have you a steady head

  fairly if i get frightened you can
come back and carry me up

  something in the dry tone brought a
quick flush to the girls cheek and a
little sparkle in her eyes without an-
swering she turned and started to pick
her way up the rough side of the cliff
dallas pausing to sling the rifle across
his back followed her

 for about a hundred feet they
worked their way up from ledge to
ledge then came a stretch of turf
firm but so steep that a fall would have
meant rolling down over the brink and
death on the jagged rocks beneath a
hundred feet up this almost precipitous
bank thalia paused and standing
beautifully poised looked back at dal-
las who was working his way gingerly
up on all fours

  better not look back snapped the
young man and i say thalia
dont stand up like that it makes me
rather sick to look at you he glanced
back over his shoulder then rested
digging his toes into the turf and flat-
tening his body against the almost ver-
tical incline my word this is worse
than sheer rock

  thalia glanced at him sharply and
the smile left her lips

  give me the rifle said she

  dont be silly

  no i insist this is only danger-
ous if one gets giddy and heights have
absolutely no effect on me come slip
it off

  thalia dont lean forward like
that dallas dug his fingers into the
soft mold hang it its worse to
watch you than it is to climb the bally
thing come on lets go up


the popular magazine

   she threw him a quick anxious look
 then turned and began to climb rapidly
 upward on a narrow ledge of less
 than a yard in width she stopped and
 waited for dallas to join her

  there are only about fifty feet
more said the girl and then it will
be easier but the next fifty feet are
rather sheer will you not give me the
rifle 

   look here thalia said dallas if
 you keep on bothering me about this
 confounded rifle ill throw it over the
 edge of the precipice

   better that than to risk a fall

   i dont intend to fall but its some
 time since ive done any climbing and
 my head isnt quite as steady as it might
 be

   then i insist on your giving me the
  rifle

  stop it growled dallas come
on lets get it over with

   without answering the girl started
 to work her way up a narrow fissure
 on the face of the cliff a little higher
 the seam widened into what is known
 to alpinists as a chimney nearly
 at the top thalia who was in the act
 of swinging her lithe body over the rim
 of a broad shelf heard a gasp and
 poised as she was glanced back into
 dallas pale upturned face while he
 was reaching up to grip a spur of rock
 which offered a safe handhold the
 stock of the rifle had struck the face
 of the cliff in such a way as to upset
 his balance for the moment insecure
 as a result he had pitched sideways
 and only saved himself from falling by
 thawing his outside foot across to the
 opposite wall of the chimney so that
 he stopped for the moment wedged in
 something of the position of a circus
 performer riding two horses with one
 foot on the back of either beneath
 him the chimney widened so that if
 he had slipped down a few inches his
 purchase would have been lost and he
 would have fallen to the ledge and

thence to the jagged rocks a hundred
feet or more beneath

  as thalia glanced down her prac-
ticed eye saw the danger which was for
the moment extreme swinging herself
face downward across the ledge she
gripped the shoulder of dallas loose
khaki coat although unable to hold
his weight she could nevertheless take
a good deal of it and what was more
important shift it to the side of the
foot which was well planted dallas
feeling the other foot beginning to slip
on the face of the rock and realizing
the danger of his position knew in-
stinctively that if he fell he would drag
the girl after him he turned his
blanched face up to hers

  let go he gasped im all right
thalias own face was like chalk
kick yourself back to the ledge
she panted quick

  dallas hand as well as his foot
was braced against the outer wall the
fingers of his other hand were hooked
in a little crevice

  id lose my balance

 no you wont do as i say
thalia spoke through her clenched
teeth

  all right here goes

  putting out all his strength dallas
thrust himself violently back against
the face of the cliff as he did so thalia
swung his body with all her force in
the same direction and for a moment
held him barely balanced against the
sheer side of the rock but dallas felt
that he could not keep his position
let go he gasped

  now reach up and grab that knob
of rock with your free hand

  dont dare

  do as i say

  like a man in a nightmare he swung
his arm upward fflr a moment he hung
poised on the verge of falling then his
fingers closed on the projection and
for the moment he was safe
 princbss of the balkans



 now climb up said thalia
slowly

  with his heart in his mouth dallas
slowly raised himself to the rim of the
ledge then over it and a moment later
was lying face downward on the rock

  for a few seconds he neither moved
nor spoke then he turned his hag-
gard colorless face toward the girl
thalias breath was coming quickly her
cheeks were like chalk and her eyes
dark and luminous

  that was a close squeak said
dallas

  she nodded dallas raised himself
and crawled back from the brink

  thalia said he if i had fallen
youd have come too

  i should have wanted to

  dallas held out his hand and thalia
dropped hers into it their eyes met
for a moment then those of the girl
looked away

  we are all right now said she
the rest is easy

  dallas did not answer and for a
moment the two sat side by side in si-
lence then thalia who had been
looking down upon the cabin far be-
neath uttered a little exclamation

  what is it asked dallas

  those people she pointed down-
ward

  staring in the direction indicated
dallas saw a company of men ascend-
ing the trail which led to the hut there
appeared to be about a dozen all of
whom were carrying guns as far as
he could see for the distance was con-
siderable the men were dressed like the
shepherds and swineherds which they
had met from time to time

  who are they  he asked

  thalia shook her head

  i dont like it muttered dallas

  nor i

  he glanced at her quickly brig-
ands

  look cried the girl there be-
hind the hut what is dimitri doing

ca

  in the rear of the cabin they could
see the guide apparently pawing at
something under the edge of the wall
as they watched puzzled and dis-
turbed the man hauled a gun from un-
derneath the cabin laying the weapon
aside he reached in again and hauled
out another then a third and a fourth
and then suddenly dallas understood

  its a trap  he snarled turning his
pale face to thalia the swine is
stealing the rifles you see he
knocked a hole in the mud wall and
shoved the guns through then went
around behind so as not to be seen its
a put-up job thalia hes been wait-
ing for that gang down below

  as he spoke the serb gathered up
the four guns and stood for a moment
as if listening dallas quickly unslung
his rifle and flung himself face down-
ward on the edge of the cliff

  what cried thalia breathlessly
you are going to-to--

  her voice failed her but dallas
was measuring the range with a cold
practiced eye

 seven hundred-eight hundred-
but its a drop he inuttered fingering
the sight of the beautiful weapon

  thalia clasped her hands over her
mouth her light hazel eyes had grown
suddenly black

  down below the treacherous serb
had turned and was stealing away in
front of the cabin sir james and paula
were standing side by side apparently
looking up toward the ledge connors
was not in sight the company of men
coming up the trail had stopped under
the brow of the hill and appeared to be
waiting

  lying face downward dallas cud-
dled the stock of his rifle under his chin
thalia her hands still clasped over her
mouth was watching dimitri who
presently paused again and looked back

  dallas was as rigid as the rocks be-
neath him the long thin blue-black


the popular magazine

rifle barrel had lost its slight oscillation
and was motionless as he

  then all at once there leaped from
the muzzle a pale-blue jet there was a
sharp report which was the next in-
stant rolled out from the sheer side of
the mountain in echoing reverberations
dallas jerked his head quickly to the
side while as if by instinct his hand
went to the lever and threw a fresh
cartridge into the chamber

  but there was no need far below
the small crouching figure of dimitri
lurched suddenly forward his arms
flew out and the rifles went scattering
in all directions the body straight-
ened and a faint yell was wafted up in
thin and tremulous tones then the
guides figure swayed tottered and fell
upon the ground where it lay motion-
less

chapter viii

  thalia stifled a little scream then
 well shot she cried with spirit

  still lying on his face with the muz-
zle of his rifle projecting over the edge
of the cliff dallas turned to her a
white face in which his gray eyes shone
like two pieces of jade

  thanks it wasnt so bad consider-
ing the range-eh

  but thalia was looking down upon
the cabin far beneath

  look she cried

  at the sound of the rifle shot con-
nors had come quickly out of the hut
then as dimitris death scream rang
out he and sir james had rushed into
the hut as dallas guessed to secure
their weapons an instant later they
emerged passed around the cabin and
when thalia spoke they were leaning
over the body of the serb presently
connors rolled it on its back in a man-
ner which shewed dallas that the guide
was quite dead then the irishman
looked up toward the mountainside and
waved his hat as if in acknowledgment
of the success of dallas long shot

  you killed said thalia between
her teeth

  that was my object he deserved
it dont you think

  the girl threw him a quick curious
look

  did you ever kill a man before
no but it looks as if i might have
to kill a few more pretty soon see
there he waved his rifle toward the
cabin the wild-looking band of armed
men had passed around the edge of the
clearing and come in sight of the hut
sir james had returned to paula and
connors who had gathered up the rifles
dropped by the serb was standing by
the cabin door apparently loading
them suddenly sir james turned and
stared at the band whch was distant
about a hundred yards then preceded
by paula walked to the hut and en-
tered

  ah muttered dallas they see
them wish we were down there
what do you think they are thalia
brigands he looked up at the girl
who nodded they were both rather
pale and thalias eyes had darkened

  yes she answered brigands for
the time being probably recruited by
dimitri to rob us and perhaps hold us
for ransom it was arranged no doubt
between him and the herder at the cabin
of whom we stopped last night see
-she pointed downward-the swine-
herd is talking to them and they are
looking up here

  they will be hunting us directly
growled dallas and ive only four
rounds left what rotten luck to have
been up here just when that gang ar-
rived  but if we had been down there
the chances are that dimitri would have
got away with the guns he added
thoughtfully

 we are much better here than
there said thalia those other peo-
ple are trapped but they are two good
fighting men and have rifles and plenty
of ammunition and there is venison
a princess of the balkans



and water and wine and other food in
the hut they can stand three days
siege and by that time we can rescue
them

  we can 

  yes dont you see what we have
got to do we are just on the edge of
my country it is only the other side
of those hills she motioned across
the valley two days journey on foot
and we shall begin to fall in with the
shkipetari the first albanian we meet
will raise his clan in no time when i
tell him who i am and we will come
back here and feed that carrion-she
tossed her head toward the herders-
to the jackals

  dallas glanced at her quickly the
girls voice carried a fierce little ring
there was a bright red spot in either
cheek and her eyes were aflame for
the first time the young man realized
that the girl beside him was herself
pure albanian a native of the wild
mountain fastnesses which had been the
scene of so many sanguinary feuds and
that she herself possessed no very thick
veneer of what is generally understood
as civilization but he cast his eyes in
the direction of the wild country which
intervened and shook his head doubt-
fully

  do you think that we could do it
he asked

  we have got to

  but first we must get past these peo-
ple  then we would not dare to take the
road but would have to go cross coun-
try and we have no food nor shelter-
not even a blanket where could you
sleep 

  on the ground we can build a
fire what else is there to do

  give ourselves up said dallas if
it is only the question of a ransom
thalias mouth grew scornful

  you may if you like she answered
i shall try for dakabar

  dallas turned to her a slightly red-
dened face it is for the safety of

you girls of course he said this is
my expedition and i will stand any in-
cidental expenses-such as a few thou-
sand pounds ransom i should far
rather do that than to expose you to
danger and hardship

  thalias face softened she stooped
and patted dallas shoulder as he lay
half sprawled on one hip his rifle under
him

  you are a dear said she but
my plan is not so difficult we can slip
past those men in the beech woods on
the other side of this mountain and
you still have four shots the others
can hold out oh look look down
there dallas

  the herders were advancing in a
body toward the hut when they were
within fifty yards of the door sir
james stepped out rifle in hand and
waved them back they halted and
there appeared to be some sort of dis-
cussion going on the hillmen from
their gestures apparently asserting
their friendly intentions while the eng-
lishman made from time to time the
backward motion with his rifle barrel

  then all at once the palaver came to
a sudden and startling end there was
a commotion among the herders sir
james sprang quickly back into the hut
sudden jets of blue-white smoke leaped
out from the clustered hillmen and a
moment later the crash of a scattering
volley came up in multiple reverbera-
tions

  the murderous swine snarled
dallas instinctively shoving out his
- but thalia crouching beside
him laid her hand quickly on his arm

  save your shots said she we
may need them

  thats -so he lowered the rifle
and looked at her over his shoulder
hope nobody got hit that shack is
built of stones and mud and ought to
stop bullets ah

  the hillmen had opened their ranks
and were approaching the cabin when


the popular magazine

two thin puffs of smoke leaped appar-
ently from the solid wall a faint yell
quavered up from beneath one of the
herders pitched forward on his face
while another reeled backward and fell
across a pile of stones again came the
fatal spurts of smoke from the cabin
and another hillman was down and
crawling away on all fours the herd-
ers scattered swiftly flying for shelter
in all directions while the air was filled
with the rumbling reverberations
thrown back from one side of the valley
to the other

  dallas turned a pale but exultant face
toward thalia

 fine oh fine he cried and
clapped his thigh theyve knocked
loopholes in all four walls gad
there are three of the beggars out of
the running thalia how many more
were there in the gang a dozen per-
haps 

  more than that but dallas we
must go

  then you want to try for daka-
bar 

  what else is there to do those
animals mean murder and loot and
we have no time to spare they know
that we are up here

  he nodded and swung himself to his
feet

  yes they will be stalking us pres-
ently the war is on now we will
try to get around into the woods on the
other side of the mountain then work
down to the river do you think we
can get across

  we must-even if we have to swim
for it

  dallas did not answer but led the
way along the little shelf which pres-
ently broadened into a sort of grassy
terrace almost a mountain pasture
crossing this they came upon a steep
bowlder-strewn slope which a quarter
of a mile below was met by a heavy
growth of beech woods extending all
the way down into the valley far be-

low they could hear the roar of the

moravitza

  down the rocky slope they plunged
as fast as safety would permit then
presently the forest closed in about
them splendid beeches and oaks with
here and there scattering conifers
pines and firs there was very little
underbrush and their eyes were kept
alert for any sign of the enemy

  both were beginning to think that
they would reach the river unmolested
when from close at hand upon their
right there came a loud report and a
bullet hummed past their heads

  jump behind a tree cried dallas

  five paces to their left a big beech
reared its sheltering trunk and under
the cover of this they slipped like in-
dians about a hundred yards away
a blue cloud of smoke was dissipating
m the thick foliage overhead

  hes behind that oak whispered
dallas crouch down thalia ill
shoot over your head if i get sight of
him

  for a moment they waited then
dallas muttered stop here ill run
him out

  it had crossed his mind that their
enemy was probably armed with a muz-
zle loader also that they had little time
to lose between them and the oak
about which the smoke was swirling
there were several big trees and leav-
ing his shelter dallas ran for the cover
of the nearest just as he reached it he
caught a glimpse of a dark figure run-
ning back into the woods dallas
sprang clear of his tree threw up his
rifle took a quick shot at a range of
not more than fifty yards and saw the
man plunge headforemost into a clump
of bushes which looked like laurel

  got him he called to thalia
come on

 together they ran on down the
wooded slope a little lower they en-
countered a thick growth of scrub into
which they slipped like hares plunging
a princess of the balkans



through thorns and brambles from
which they finally emerged upon the
bank of the river

  listen said thalia as they
crouched in the dense willow growth
that fringed the shore

  not far behind them there had bro-
ken out a clamor of savage yells which
were answered faintly from higher up
the mountains

  they are coming panted dallas
we cant stop here lets try to get
across

  they had struck the river at one of
its still reaches and as the autumn
rains had not yet begun the stream was
low with pebbly bars and broad stand-
ing pools close to the opposite bank
however they could see a narrow chan-
nel of swift dark water which a little

farther downstream was hidden from

                                      

sight by what would have been when
the river was high a long narrow island
thickly covered with bushes and a
growth of willows dallas pointed to-
ward it with his rifle barrel

  lets get over there he said it
seems to be a good cover and we can
cross on the other side without being
seen that is if we can cross

 pushing their way through the
bushes they came out upon the shingly
river bed where for a hundred yards
they were exposed to great danger of
being seen but their enemies were
apparently higher up in the woods and
they reached the island undiscovered
and crawled into the scrub where they
sank down for a moment to rest and
breathe

  looks deep on the other side said
dallas

  we can wade it i think

  hope so

  cant you swim

  id rather smoke besides heres
the rifle

  give that to me

  look here thalia you leave that
rifle alone im a good deal of a duf-

fer i knowt but i havent reached the
stage where i must have my gun car-
ried up cliffs and across rivers for me
by a girl

  you are a little new to climbing
said thalia and you may not be much
of a swimmer but you can shoot
she rose to her feet wait here i
want to see how deep it is

  dallas waited closely watching the
opposite bank a moment later thalia
returned

  we can wade it she said the
water is not more than wraist-deep and
the current is less swift than it looks
what is the matter for dallas face
was very grave

   was thinking said he that its
a pretty serious matter to have to lie
out in the woods soaking wet there
is frost almost every night up here
thalia smiled then the color poured
into her face

  we can take them off said she
what dallas turned to her so
shocked and startled a face that she
burst into a laugh

  dont look so scandalized dallas
you can stop here until you hear me
whistle then i will go up into the
bushes and you can come over theres
no mrs grundy in the kapaonik
mountains

  dallas laughed my word thalia
but you are a good little sport go
ahead then because we havent any
time to lose

  for a moment their eyes met tha-
lias cheeks were very red and her lips
like coral thorn and brier had left
their cruel marks across her flushed
lovely face the scarf of her kalpak was
gone and stray wisps of her bronze-
black hair had escaped from under the
rim of her cap and were curling about
her delicate ears as dallas looked at
her his face was lit by a sudden glow
of admiration and at the expression
in his habitually cynical eyes thalia


the cpocpulacr magazine

first looked questioning then turned
away with a deeper flush

  gad but youre a wonder  said
dallas you look as if you actually
liked it all

  i should not mind-if it were not
for the others

  it is james that should be here
said dallas instead of me

  she slightly raised her chin and
you ought to be with paula

  had i but run along thalia
weve got no time to lose

  she turned and slipped into the
bushes and a few moments later dallas
heard the clinking of pebbles behind
him for the little island although per-
haps fifty yards in length was not more
than four or five in width he was re-
flecting on the gravity of the situation
and keeping a keen watch upon the op-
posite bank of the river when from
almost the very spot where he and tha-
lia had come out there emerged three
of the hillmen

  dallas grip on his rifle tightened in-
stinctively the three men stood for
a moment looking up and down the
stream then across in his direction as
they were a little above the head of the
island it suddenly occurred to dallas
that from where they stood it might
be possible to see thalia when she
reached the opposite bank he climbed
to his feet and crouching low pushed
his way through the dense bushes to the
edge of the channel halfway over
thalia was wading bosom-deep in the
clear icy water her clothes wrapped
into a snug bundle were held poised
upon her head by one round gleaming
arm although the current was not
swift the girl was having a hard time
to keep her footing as dallas could see
from the unsteady movements of her
head and shoulders and the oscillations
of her free arm in the water she
wore a single white undergarment
which was apparently impeding her bal-

ance for she paused occasionally as if
to disentangle herself from its folds

  dallas whistled softly and she looked
back over her shoulder when he made
a sweeping gesture downstream then
pointed toward the bank which they
had left thalia threw up her free arm
in answer dallas turned and crept
back to his ambush

  the three hillmen had separated and
were walking out across the cobbly
river bottom suddenly the one far-
thest upstream paused and pointed to
the ground the others joined him
and for a moment all three studied the
cobbles attentively it was evident to
dallas that they had found the trail
for they looked toward the little island
and half raised their weapons then
proceeded warily in his direction

  there is nothing for it he thought
grimly but to pot all three

  he raised his rifle and covered the
man to the right but for some reason
he found himself unable to pull the
trigger

  im a fool he thought and rising
to his feet strode out upon the edge
of the bar

  the herders saw him instantly and
stopped in their tracks dallas mo-
tioned them back the men did not
move dallas repeated his gesture
two of the herders fell back a pace
then the man on the left threw his
gun quickly to his shoulder and fired
dallas staggered back with a sense of
sharp violent pain there was a stab-
bing through his chest and a burning
sensation on the side of his head and
through his left forearm

  with a little snarl of rage he dropped
on one knee threw his rifle to his shoul-
der and sighting on the man who had
fired pulled the trigger the fellow
screamed flung out his arms and went
over backward the soft-nosed hunt-
ing bullet had struck him fairly in the
chest mushroomed and torn its way
through killing him instantly
a vcrincess of the balkans



  one of his companions turned and
fled back toward the bank the other
raised his weapon and fired then
wheeled about and followed him dal-
las pulling himself together with an
effort fired again but missed quite
by instinct he threw his last cartridge
into the chamber and setting his teeth
for the pain in his arm was intense
got the mans back fairly before the
sights and fired again this time the
bullet found its mark and the man went
down his weapon clattering among the
stones

  sick and giddy dallas turned and
crept back into the bushes where he
sank to the ground the blood was
streaming down the side of his face
and his left arm felt numb and power-
less there was a burning pain on the
right side of his chest he pulled up
his flannel hunting shirt and discovered
a small hole from which the blood was
trickling in crimson drops but a spot
on the outer edge of his right shoulder
blade was giving him intense pain and
placing his left hand over it he felt a
small hard object just beneath the skin

  guess im rather badly hit he
thought but i must get across before
i get any weaker

  laying down the rifle now useless
for lack of ammunition he staggered
through the bushes and into the icy
water directly opposite stood thalia
clad in a long white garment which fell
from her shoulders to her knees

  are you hit  she cried tremulously

  yes he answered and waded out
into the stream

  halfway across the water deepened
suddenly an eddy of the current caught
him and swept him off his feet down
he went but came up to find a fresh
footing the trees on the opposite
bank were blurred and misty and he
seemed to be drifting with the current
all at once the river bottom dropped
from under his feet acting by in-
stinct he struck out feebly then there

came a roaring in his ears and green
swirling lights before his eyes but he
struggled to the surface and as he did
so saw thalias face close beside his
own and felt a strong grasp on his
shoulder the bottom seemed to rise
up under his feet again and he tot-
tered up the bank to sink down help-
lessly upon the sun-warmed pebbles

  thalia was kneeling beside him her
face drawn and white and tense

  are you badly hurt she cried
dont think so muttered dallas
go and dress he struggled to sit
up but thalia flung one arm across his
chest and drew him back until his head
rested on her knee where it lay with
a little stream of blood trickling down
from his forehead

  the girls swift fingers explored the
wound from the side of the forehead
to the temple the scalp was plowed
open thalia gave a sigh of relief

  it glanced off

  yes muttered dallas the brute
peppered me with buckshot

  where else are you hit

  in the forearm and theres a slug
somewhere in my chest but im feel-
ing better now go and dress thalia
but thalia was examining the fore-
arm apparently the bullet was im-
bedded somewhere in the muscles as
there was no wound of exit

  where else in the chest she
drew up the woolen shirt and at sight
of the small sinister-looking bullet hole
gave a little gasp

  it doesnt hurt said dallas i
dont think it went through probably
hit a rib and went around because i
felt it over here on the side what
nasty brutes-to sprinkle you with
buckshot

  are you in much pain

no im not in any pain that cold
water made em all numb but you
go and dress do you hear me go
and dress you will catch cold
thalia rose slowly to her feet and


the popular magazine

stood contemplating him with an utter
disregard for the scantiness of her at-
tire which had in it something primi-
tively heroic her expressive face was
knit in lines of anxious thought

  could you get up the bank and into
the bushes she asked

  yes of course im not badly hurt
it was only the first shock that knocked
me out

  but that wound in your chest 

  dont believe it went in there
would be blood in my mouth if it had
probably followed the rib around or it
would not be there just under the skin
he clambered to his feet and stood for
a minute as if gauging his strength
seeing the pallor of his face thalia
stepped to his side and passed her
round bare arm under his

  lean on me she said

  steadied by the girl he walked up the
short pebbly beach and pushed his way
into the willows where he half fell
half sank to the ground his head swim-
ming and his vision vague and misty
thalia startled at his pallor leaned
over him

  lie down said she youre still
faint

  distressed more by his faintness
than by the pain of his wounds dallas
closed his eyes and let his head fall
backward he was dimly conscious
that it was being gently supported then
it seemed to him that he heard a sound
of tearing cloth a moment later his
head began to clear again and he
opened his eyes and looked up under
the brim of a bandage bound snugly
across his forehead and into the face
of thalia who was bending anxiously
over him

  whats this thing he raised his
hand to his head

  a bandage my dear

  where did you get it

  at the chemists around the cor-
ner

  dallas raised himself till he sat up-

right he looked at thalia who was
sitting cross-legged an anxious smile
on her lips and her wet garment hang-
ing limply from her shoulders

  i thought i told you to go and
dress said dallas sternly now go
i shall not speak to you again until you
get your clothes on

  he turned his back upon the girl
and sat for a few minutes trying to
fight off his light-headedness a little
time elapsed then the bushes behind
him rustled and he looked over his
shoulder to see thalia a servian peas-
ant boy again she looked at him in-
quiringly

  i feel quite fit now said he but
thalia we are in a bad fix

  she nodded her lovely face very
grave

  there is only one thing for us to
do dallas i have found a little path
which must lead up to a house not far
above us because i followed it for a
few steps and came upon a spring all
stoned in with footprints in the ground
about it we must go up and take our
chances

  you think its safe

  theres no choice you are wounded
and soaking wet and must have shel-
ter besides hospitality is a very sa-
cred thing all through these mountains
-all over the balkans in fact per-
haps i can talk to the people and make
them understand that it would be to
their profit to treat us well can you
walk a little distance

  oh yes im all right now you
are right thalia weve got to have
shelter

 pushing their way through the
bushes they came presently upon a lit-
tle footpath which wound up through
a pine grove to come out a short dis-
tance beyond upon a small plateau cov-
ered with splendid oaks the spot was
charmingly picturesque one hundred
feet below them flowed the moravitza
on three sides of the plateau the land
a princess of the balkans



fell away steeply and on the fourth
rose the precipitous side of the moun-
tain there was no underbrush and
through the vistas between the big tree
trunks they could see far down the val-
ley and catch glimpses of the distant
hills bathed in the brilliant yellow sun-
light of the late afternoon

  theres the cabin said thalia
pointing toward the mountainside

  snugly built in the shelter of the
overhanging cliffs was a clean little
dwelling tidy and picturesque con-
structed of stones and clay with a roof
of hand-hewn pine slabs behind it at
a little distance was a shed or stable
and about the door of this some she-
goats were browsing quietly their kids
tucked here and there asleep in the
sunny patches fluffy little balls of fur
the door of the cabin was slightly ajar
there was not a sound about the place
nor was there any smoke coming from
the chimney

  thalia and dallas walked straight up
to the cabin then paused and the girl
called aloud there was no reply but
as they waited a large yellow cat came
walking calmly out and with its tail
straight in the air approached the girl
and rubbed purring against her leg

  the man and the girl looked at each
other and smiled

  a kind welcome at least said he

  the wise-faced nanny goats had been
regarding them curiously but with no
sign of alarm the kids also had raised
their baby faces to look and as dallas
spoke one of the little creatures hopped
upon its stumpy feet and came bound-
ing toward him first to butt playfully
at his knee and then to sniff at his fin-
gers with a soft expectant little nose
the mother followed more slowly and
sedately and with no trace of fear

  if the people receive us as kindly as
their animals said dallas we shall
be in luck

  thalia who had been closely scru-

tinizing the cabin turned to him a face
which showed great relief

  i think we have come to the right
place said she this is the cabin of
a holy man probably a hermit
christian 

  no mohammedan but he must be
really a good man and no doubt kind
from the way his pets behave do you
see those little scraps of rags fastened
to the window shutters 

  yes what are they

  prayers-or at least reminders of
prayers votive offerings of a sort
lets look in

  they walked toward the cabin and
the cat followed purring as they
reached the door there was a fluttering
over their heads and a large jay came
tumbling from the treetops a flash of
blue and gray shimmering feathers
the bird fluttered about their heads
then lighted on the window sill and
hopped inside

  thalia glanced at dallas and smiled
then slipping a loop of cord from a
peg in the door pushed it open and
entered

   within was a single large room quite
bare and scrupulously neat and clean
there was a big open fireplace and
in one corner a sort of raised platform
on which were spread some sheepskins
and a heavy woolen blanket in the
other corner were some shelves filled
with what looked to be manuscripts
in front of the window stood a rough
table on which was an earthen vessel
holding a cluster of late roses beside
which were a pair of big steel-rimmed
spectacles an inkwell a long plume
pen and a large leather-bound book
the jay bird had entered through a
crevice between the shutters and was
pecking at some crumbs of bread on the
table it cocked its head gave them a
bright inquiring look then strutted
back to the window and flew out with
a burst of melody which sounded like
bird laughter


the pocpular magazine

  there cant be much harm in this
man said dallas suppose we con-
sider ourselves his guests

  he crossed the room and seated him-
self on the edge of the platform tha-
lia glancing at him saw that his face
was very pale and that his lips were
blue and trembling she was at his side
instantly

  lie down said she i will build a
fire and then we must get off those wet
clothes and see to your wounds
dallas stretched himself out and
drew the blanket over him his teeth
were beginning to chatter and all his
strength had suddenly left him he
pulled out his match box which was
fortunately water-tight and handed it
to the girl thalia went out to return
presently with an armful of wood and
in a few moments there was a fire blaz-
ing on the hearth

  now we must make you comfort-
able said she are you in pain 
no-just a little stiff and sore
he began to struggle with his coat
thalia went to his aid

  i can manage muttered dallas
nonsense you are a wounded
man and i am your nurse

 but-

  dont talk keep the blanket over
you now let us get off this wet shirt
now let me see your arm what a
wicked-looking little hole the bullet
is in there shouldnt it come out

  i dont see how were going to man-
age it let it stay dallas sank back
and pulled the blanket over him

  thalia was tearing some cloth into
strips hearing the ripping noise dal-
las turned his head and looked at her
what are you doing

  dont ask questions

 but you mustnt-

  hush i am going out now to get
some pine balsam from one of those
trees to smear over the wvound that
is shkipetari treatment it stings a
little but it is clean and healing

  youre a wonder muttered dallas
the girl went out to return pres-
ently with some of natures ointment
on a piece of bark when the wounds
were quickly bandaged dallas
wrapped in the big woolen blanket with
his head on a pile of sheepskins fell
into a doze when he opened his eyes
again he saw that his clothes were dry-
ing in front of the fire while thalia
stood beside him with a smile on her
red lips and a bowl in her hand

  i have been milking the goats
come dallas drink this we were
fortunate to find this place there is
corn meal and cheese and olives and
some dried plums and i have found a
little cave outside stored full of beet
roots and turnips and cabbages be-
sides there are some chickens shut up
in a coop between the cabin and the
cliffs we shall not starve

  any sign of our host

  no do you know dallas i have
an idea that he may have heard the
firing and gone across the river to see
what it was all about perhaps he has
persuaded the herders to go away
you havent heard any more fir-
ing

  not a shot

  then perhaps you are right

  oh i hope so i hope so

  he may have gone on with james
and the others

  but do you think that they would
go without us

  very possibly because you see
they would be likely to guess at our
plan and they must have heard the fir-
ing down there by the river they
could tell the crack of my - and
very likely think that by this time we
are miles away

  thalia nodded thoughtfully and for
a few moments neither spoke pres-
ently dallas muttered as if to himself
poor old james

  why asked thalia quickly
a vxrincbss of the balkans



 think how worried he must be
about you thalia

  why not about you

  oh well im a man and you see
hes-in love with you

  indeed

  dallas looked at her curiously of
course he is has he never told you
so

  never

  well he is

  what makes you think so

  oh several things among others
his telling me so about sixteen times a
day

  and paula are you not horribly
worried about her

  naturally but i dont see what
there is to do about it i say thalia
it is james who ought to be here now
in my place

 wounds and all how nice of
you

  id forgot all about the wounds
but not about paula said the girl
in a low voice

  but im not in love with paula nor
she with me im very fond of her and
think shes a little brick and the best
little sport in the world barring one
i say thalia arent my clothes almost
dry 

  thalia got up and examined the gar-
ments which she had wrung out and
hung before the hot blaze

  quite perhaps you had better put
them on

  i think so i can manage just give
them to me and then go out and play
with the kids

  the girl obeyed in silence a little
later when dallas called her she came
in to find him dressed again and puz-
zling over the big book on the table
by the platform

  whats this thing asked dallas
the koran do you find it inter-
esting

  very the whole state of affairs

is that but you are the most interesting
of all my dear girl

  she threw him a quick look then
walked to the door of the cabin and
seated herself upon the threshold
where she remained in silence watch-
ing the setting sun as it sank in a crim-
son glow behind the hilltops far down
the valley

  presently she arose and walking to
the table poured some milk into the
bowl and setting it on the hearthstone
called the yellow cat which came pur-
ring and placidly proceeded to make its
evening meal dallas looked at the two
and smiled

  quite cozy and domestic said he
but really i ought to be james
thalia turned to him swiftly a little
line had drawn itself between her eyes
which were dark and glowing

 can you think of nothing but
james she demanded with a little
toss of her chin

 but thalia-

  it is just james james james i
must say i dont think that it is in very
good taste mr dallas

  oh come thalia you know per-
fectly well-

  i dont know anything she replied
sharply except that you seem to be
very much upset because it is you and
not james here in this cabin with me
i have tried to take good care of you
and to be cheerful and not to show
how anxious i have been and worried

and-and- she turned away with

a little stamp of her sandaled foot

  but thalia dont you see-dont
you think im appreciative of your
pluck and resource and cheerfulness
and all that  i am thinking about you
indeed one would never guess it
it seems as though you were thinking
of nobody but james

  i am sorry

  so am i-very i wish it were-
james she stopped and began to
stroke the cat dallas lying on the


the povular magazine

platform regarded her with a puzzled
face

  do you really of course why
shouldnt you

  outside the late summer sunset had
softened to a rich delicious afterglow
thalia got up suddenly and walked to
the door where she stood for a mo-
ment breathing deeply the sweet even-
ing air a kid ran up to her and began
to push its hard downy little head play-
fully against her knees the girl leaned
down to stroke the small animal then
pushed one finger into the moist little
mouth when play forgotten it began
to suck lustily and to bite with its baby
teeth

  dallas moved restlessly when she
turned and looked at him her lovely
face filled with shadows and her eyes
large and dark and inscrutable

  i say thalia youve had no sup-
per

  indeed i have some corn bread
and milk and cheese that is a feast
for an albanian you see mr dallas
you are of a different race and one ac-
customed to luxury whereas i am a
shkipetari hill girl and able to live roy-
ally where you would starve to-night
you can have only warm milk because
you are an invalid and there is danger
of fever from your wounds but to-
morrow if you are doing nicely you
shall have some eggs and other deli-
cacies and be as carefully fed and
cared for as if you were-james
there is not a great deal to do with
but i shall do my best mr dallas
stop calling me mr dallas

  thalia did not answer presently
dallas said where are you going to
sleep

  on the floor in front of the fire
indeed you shall do nothing of the
sort besides you have no blanket
but where else can i sleep and
i do not need a blanket you see i
am just a balkan hillwoman and-

  stop it thalia what is the mat-
ter with you

  im sure i dont know what you
mean

  you shall sleep here i am going
to sleep in front of the fire myself

  that is nonsense thalia crossed
the room and walked to the side of the
platform

  i mean it do you think im going
to pig everything just because ive got
a couple of buckshot under my pelt i
shall camp in front of the fire for-
getting his wounded arm dallas shoved
himself upright then sat swaying gid-
dily from the pain caused by the effort

  dallas dont cant you be good 
lie down oh please please please 
if you only knew how worried i am
about you thalias rich voice broke

  the man was too weak to contend
further so it ended in the girls having
her own way in sleeping in front of the
fire while dallas sank back exhausted
onto the platform

chapter ix

  dallas was awakened by a thin sun-
beam which had found its way through
a crevice in the shutters and was shin-
ing directly into his eyes he blinked
and sat up dazed and bewildered

  a stab of pain in his arm brought
him quickly back to a sense of his sur-
roundings  the wound of his head did
not bother him but his side was very
sore otherwise he felt himself quite
fit and with no indication of fever

  resting on one elbow he looked
about him with a smile outside the
jay birds were protesting violently at
the late opening hours of their restau-
rant and the goats were bleating ex-
pectantly from the brightness of the
sunshine dallas guessed that the day
must be well advanced but as door and
shutters were closed the light in the
cabin was still deeply subdued

  snuggled up against the young man
a princess of the balkans



lay the yellow cat in front of the fire
slept the lady thalia and dallas
glancing with a smile from one to the
other of his companions found it im-
possible to determine which appeared
to be the more at ease thalias face
was turned toward him her cheek was
on one palm her lips slightly parted
and her wavy hair tumbled about her
face which was a little flushed and
dewy with sleep her heavy double-
breasted tunic of homespun wool was
loosened at the neck and her soft
throat looked very white and delicate
against the rough fabric in spite of
her hard bed she appeared to be sleep-
ing as easily as a child tucked up in its
crib

  as dallas looked at her his eyes
grew tender dear little girl he
thought no wonder james is crazy
about her not many women could go
through such an ordeal as yesterday
and come out of it as fresh and undis-
mayed

  he could not take his eyes from her
and perhaps the girl felt in her sleep
the intensity of his gaze for presently
she sighed yawned straightened out
her limbs like a pussycat and sleepily
pushed the hair back from her face
with one small hand then the long
dark lashes slowly lifted and her tawny
eyes looked straight into his wider
they opened and wider still with an
expression of such hopeless bewilder-
ment that dallas laughed outright
then intelligence came flooding back
and her face turned rosy pink

  oh she gasped and sat up gath-
ering her tumbled hair in both hands
her lips parted with a smile of embar-
rassment

  how do you feel she asked a
trifle breathlessly

  like a fighting cock did you have
a good sleep

  delicious this mountain air it
got rather cold in the night and i built
up the fire how do the wounds feel 

  wouldnt know that i had em i
think that they are going to close with-
out making any trouble there cant
be much infection in this climate and
besides i always heal quickly

  thalia leaned forward and began to
lace up her sandals then she rose and
crossed the room

  what are you up to now asked
dallas

  she threw him a saucy look i must
give the baby his milk then i am
going down for a dip in the river
youll freeze

  i like cold water then i must milk
the goats and see if i can find some
eggs for your breakfast you are to
lie still

  it cant hurt me to get up

  yes it can you are to keep still
  all right

  she threw him a suspicious glance
then went to the fire and heated some
of the goats milk which dallas drank
with a wry face thalia laughed then
walked to the door of the cabin and
threw it wide letting in a flood of sun-
light on the threshold she paused

 now i am going to bathe be
good she blew him a little kiss
stop it said dallas

  stop what

  throwing me kisses

  thalia raised her eyebrows mock-
ingly

  what would james say growled
dallas

  i hadnt thought

  well you must think what if i
were to throw a kiss back to you 
dreadful what would paula say
oh bosh  run along and take your
bath and be careful

  when she had gone dallas got up
and went out into the fresh fragrant
morning rather to his surprise he
found himself a little unsteady on his
feet also he discovered that moving
about gave him considerable pain in his
wounded side when thalia returned


the popular magazine

fresh and glowing she found him sit-
ting on the threshold basking in the
warm sunlight

  this is very naughty of you said
the girl go straight back and lie
down  and dallas was forced to
obey

   upon the mans repeated refusals to
allow her to sleep another night on the
floor the lady thalia collected some
loose willow boughs and made for her-
self a rough but effectual screen
around the platform corner she con-
sented to this arrangement only after
she had moved the sheepskins over in
front of the fire so that dallas could
rest there in comparative comfort

 the day wore on and the two re-
mained in undisturbed possession of the
little cabin when the late shadows
began to lengthen dallas was permitted
to get up and the two sat upon the
threshold and watched the crimson aft-
erglow flaming the skies over the dim
hills to the westward from the valley
beneath came the deep caressing mur-
mur of the river and a faint breeze
brought to them the night smells of the
forest sweet with the odors of balsam
and fern soon the darkness came and
the ruddy light from the fire began to
dance and flicker on the walls of the
cabin then dallas was sent to bed
again and fed more milk and a vege-
table soup thickened with cornmeal
for a while the two discussed the con-
tinued absence of their host and what
it might portend and why it was that
nobody came near the little cabin

 he is probably a holy man said
thalia and no doubt does miracles
and the herders are afraid to come
near there was once such a santon
who lived on the top of a mountain not
far from my fathers castle he was
a very holy man and very kind but all
the people were afraid of him because
he used to talk with the dead and bring
messages to the families of some -of
the shkipetari from people who had

been killed in feuds or perhaps mur-
dered nobody would go near his hut
when he was away or in a trance per-
haps this man is like that

  are you afraid of such things
thalia 

  a little she threw an apprehen-
sive glance about the cabin

  afraid of the dead asked dallas
amused

  i like live people better she
moved a little closer we shkipetari
are rather superstitious but i have
lived so much in england that i am
not like the others

  how did you come to live so much
in england

  my father was a very enlightened
man and a great student he sent me
to paris to school and there i made
the acquaintance of an english girl and
used to visit at her home in england
up here in these mountains it is dif-
ferent but i am not afraid when i
am with you

chapter x

  so the days went by but the girl
would not hear of their leaving the
cabin until all the soreness should have
gone from dallas wounds no human
being came near to disturb the peace
of their little haven of refuge their
life became a quiet routine of home-
like duties mornings thalia milked
the goats and ground maize of which
there was a plentiful store and cooked
their simple meals scarcely permitting
dallas to lift a hand in physical work
of any kind late in the afternoons
the two sat upon the threshold and
watched the early autumn sunsets dis-
cussing many things and watching the
coming of darkness

  one evening as they sat at the cabin
door a splendid red-deer buck stalked
out of the forest and stood for a mo-
ment stamping and snorting and watch-
ing the two with bright curious eyes
a princess of the balkans



the night following there was a great
bleating and scurrying among the goats
thalia threw open the shutters and
flung out a blazing firebrand when the
tumult ceased in the morning they
found the tracks of a wolf in the damp
sand about the cabin

  and so a week passed then dallas
announced that he was fit for the trail
his wounds had healed as a surgeon
would say by first intention the
encysted buckshot caused him no incon-
venience and there seemed no reason
why they should linger on

  the two took counsel sitting on the
floor in front of the blazing fire for
some reason both were sad at the
thought of leaving the little home which
they had come to regard as their own
nothing had occurred to mar their per-
fect comradeship although twice when
discussing the possible fate of their
friends thalia had burst suddenly into
a storm of self-reproach asserting her-
self to be the cause of whatever tragedy
might have happened and finishing in a
paroxysm of tears the second time
dallas had thrown his arm about her
shoulders and talked to her as sooth-
ingly as though she had been an over-
wrought child a method which proved
singularly effective the frenzy of her
grief abated he had drawn a little apart
and reasoned with her quietly until she
had recovered her self-control

  from time to time the young man
had talked to her of sir james describ-
ing his many admirable qualities and
dwelling at some length upon the eng-
lishmans oft-asserted devotion to her-
self and the many excellent results
which might accrue to both if they
were to marry to all of this thalia
had listened with downcast eyes an
occasional sidelong glance and a rather
pale and inscrutable face

  we can make dakabar easily in two
days thalia said dallas as the two
sat staring into the flames that
scoundrel dimitri told me that the trail

crossed the river at a ford a little above
here

  thalia nodded you are right she
answered listlessly we will go to-
morrow i will put some bread and
boiled potatoes and chestnuts in a sack
and we will start i suppose that the
wolf will get the goats and poor mimi
will have to catch mice but you are
right we must not stay here any
longer

  the odd note in her voice caused
dallas to look at her sharply thalias
face was quite pale and her eyes were
dark and misty

  you speak as if you did not want
to go said he

  really she gave him a masked
look why should i want to stop here
any longer

  i cant imagine i should think that
you could hardly wait to learn what has
happened to paula and james

  thalia looked at him with glowing
eyes and a bright red spot in either
cheek

  of course i want to know what has
happened to paula and james she re-
torted have i not been nearly mad
from anxiety but i have tried to be
patient and not to show it and have
cooked and gathered wood and milked
and slept on planks because i did not
think that you ought to travel until
your wounds were healed

  thalia

  and now you look at me with sur-
prise and say we have wasted time
enough 

  but i havent said anything of the
kind

  you have implied it her voice
rose slightly in pitch im sure i dont
know what would have happened to you
if we had started sooner

  but my dear little girl dont you

suppose that i appreciate-

  no cried thalia furiously i
dont think that you have sense enough


the popular magazine

to appreciate anything unless it is-
james

  thalia

  or paula

  thalia stop it dallas stared at
her in bewilderment thalia looked
back defiantly her chin was thrust
out and her eyes somber and half
veiled by their long lashes were staring
into the fire over the curve of her
flushed cheeks her black hair with
its lurid tones of sienna was tumbled
about her ears and her breath was com-
ing quickly

  dallas reached for her hand but the
girl snatched it angrily away

  youre overwrought my dear and
i must say i dont blame you said dal-
las the strain has been enough to

make any woman-

  oh so you think i am complain-
ing

  not a bit of it but i do think that
you are feeling the strain of it all

i am not feeling the strain of any-
thing unless it is that of being con-
tinually criticized and misunderstood
but thalia i understand
really thalias red lip curled
well cried dallas in desperation
then what is the matter

  there is nothing the matter
  then why are you so angry

  i am not angry what is there to
be angry about

  but why do you blame me for want-
ing to go on

  i am not blaming you it is you
who are blaming me and hinting that
i am not as anxious as i ought to be
about paula and-james she struck
her sandaled foot repeatedly against the
floor then leaned over to tighten the
thongs about her round ankle i know
why you are so restless and anxious to
be on she threw him a sidelong
glance it is because your tobacco is
all gone

  no answered dallas softly its

because my-something else is almost
gone

  thalia half turned her head and
looked at him under lowered lashes

  what do you mean  she asked
rather breathlessly

  i mean answered dallas slowly
and without looking at her that you
are the dearest and sweetest and love-
liest woman i have ever known and
that sometimes i find it very hard to
remember that my dearest friend has
told me that he cares for you

  thalia looked at him fixedly her
amber eyes almost black and the glare
of the fire reflected crimsonly on her
lovely face

  but i dont care for him she an-
swered in a very low voice

  you ought to

  oh but i do in one way he is
splendid and chivalrous and straight-
forward and of course i appreciate all
that he has done for me but-her
voice fell-i dont love him

  dallas looked into her face his eyes
were glowing like embers

  but you did at least you cared a
good deal-before we went up the side
of that mountain

  and what if i did i had never
told him so nor had he ever said that
he cared for me

  thats because hes too fine and gen-
erous and you were in a way under
his care

  and how about yourself did
james tell me to let go when i was
holding him half balanced on the side
of a cliff did he tell me to let go for
fear id be dragged over and killed
too 

  he would have done so quickly
enough if he had been the one mut-
tered dallas

  i dont doubt it thalia gasped
and the words came pouring out pell-
mell and did james fight for me
and was he wounded for me and
did i swim out and save him when he
a cpcrincbss of thb balkans



was struggling in the current  and did
i nurse him and feed him and-

  thalia thalia dallas groaned
stop it oh my dear dont you see
how hard you are making it for me 

  she turned her lurid eyes to his

  and dont you suppose that you are
making it hard for me and have been
right along with your everlasting talk
of james james james oh dallas
dallas it is you that i love just you
you you i have never loved anybody
else i shall never love any one
else oh my dear my dear she
began to sob and her body swayed back
and forth and threw dancing shadows
 the cabin walls

  dallas turned to her swiftly his face
very pale and his eyes aflame

  thalia my own darling i adore
you  his voice choked

  she turned her face to him the tears
sparkling on her cheeks dallas raised
both arms but before he could clasp
her thalias own were about his neck
and her face crushed to his  her sobs
broke out afresh

  thalia cried dallas crushing her
to him my own darling i love you
more than anything in the world he
kissed the tears from the hot flushed
cheeks i shall tell james all about it
sweetheart he is big and generous
he will understand but until i do
you must help me dear or i would
despise myself for all the rest of my
life

  the minutes flew by and still he held
her close talking to her soothingly until
presently her sobs ceased and she
looked up at him with a smile

  yes dearest she whispered i un-
derstand i will help you and you
really love me-and dont love paula 

  darling i love only you

chapter xi

  noon of the following day found
them climbing a high pass in the hills
with the river a silvery thread far be-

low on either side was dense forest
alternating with bare bowlder-strewn
hillsides and the air was fine and keen
and filled with sunshine

  presently their trail led out across
the shoulder of a high hill whence they
were able to look away for leagues to
the southward over a wonderful ex-
panse of hill and valley the whole of
which seemed to be inclosed by a high
broken wall of mountains blue with dis-
tance and filled with marvelous shad-
ows of saffron and amethyst

  those are the north albanian alps
said thalia they form part of the
southern boundary of novibazar my
people came originally from the other
side of that range but the turks drove
them northward and now we occupy
those slopes which you see down to-
ward the end of the valley near the
castle where i lived when my father
was alive there are two little streams
which rise almost side by side and one
of them flows into the danube and the
other into the iegean sea

  really and where does prince
emilio come from

 from a place called rascia not far
from the town of novibazar we are
quite near neighbors not more than a
six-hour journey on foot

  do you know this road thalia

  i have never been here before but
i know it a little farther on where it
strikes the valley of the lim higher
up it crosses the main road from cet-
tinje to nis look my dear she
pointed down the steep slope here
come some people

  twice during the morning they had
avoided other travelers the first
whom they had met were mohammedan
plum growers packing down their dried
prunes  a train of meager mountain
ponies the others were serb swine-
herds a savage filthy crew

  climbing up the precipitous bank
they crouched behind a clump of
bracken and waited for the newcomers


the popular magazine

to pass these proved to be a troupe
of chingeni or balkan gypsies they
were a ragged lot of nomads perhaps
twenty in all with warm swarthy skins
features of markedly hindu type and
dark lustrous eyes the hamals pow-
erful young fellows were carrying
packs almost as large as those borne by
the dozen wretched ponies two young
women superbly made were swinging
easily up the steep incline each with a
child carried in a sort of sling a lame
man sitting astride an overloaded pony
was playing a violin and playing mar-
velously well it seemed to dallas the
caravan passed chattering up the trail
when the two refugees came out of
their hiding place

  they are striking across the moun-
tains for the big road from belgrade
to constantinople said thalia they
will meet it on the morava then pass
on up through trajans gate and prob-
ably hold right on for stamboul where
no doubt they have their winter mal-
hallah

  presently the path began to descend
and a little later led through a gorge
marvelously beautiful with bare rocky
walls and a cataract foaming at the
bottom the two had paused to admire
the savage wildness of the place when
thalia exclaimed

  some one is coming

  dallas listened and heard the clatter
of many hoofs on the rocky trail below
them he glanced quickly about for a
place where they might get under cover
but there was none to be had above
them rose sheer bare crags and below
the ground while not very steep was
naked of bush or bowlder

  we shall have to run back up the
trail said he

  too late answered thalia here
they come

  wrhat are they-soldiers 

  a troop of horsemen had appeared
around a curve of the road ahead and
was approaching at a rapid walk the

riders looked to be uniformed and
were armed with guns but the two
fugitives gave scarcely a glance at the
men for riding at their head was a
colossal figure khaki-clad with a kal-
pak of fine astrakhan set over a fierce
deep-lined face which even at that dis-
tance portrayed its characteristic fea-
tures of black bushy eyebrows and
heavy black mustache and imperial

  rosenthal cried dallas

  at the same instant the jew had rec-
ognized the fugitives with a harsh
exclamation he spurred his horse for-
ward to rein up with a jerk in front
of them

  sapristi cried rosenthal what
luck what good fortune i was
afraid you was killed

  he flung himself from his horse
threw the reins to one of his men and
strode toward dallas his diabolic face
working with emotion and one big hand
thrust in front of him the palm open-
ing and closing spasmodically

  py chingo he cried in his harsh
voice but this is a pleasure to find
you alive and unhurt he seized dal-
las in his great arms and actually em-
braced him then turned to thalia and
laughed sapristi but who is this
handsome boy  before the astonished
girl could avoid it he had embraced her
also and would no doubt have kissed
her on both cheeks had she not twisted
her head aside rosenthal was bub-
bling over with delight belief me
i could not be more overjoyed if i had
sold my silver mines for one hundred
tousand pounds nefer haf i been so
worried i had come to tink that you
must haf been killed 

  he beamed upon them with a grin
which was almost a physical violence
in itself his bushy eyebrows worked
up and down and his yellow teeth wrere
bared like those of a grinning wolf
but the big deeply scored vital face
was filled with such a real benevolence
as to disarm its savagery of feature
a princess of the balkans



dallas felt himself ridiculously like a
runaway child caught while playing
truant by a kind but undesired peda-
gogue as for thalia the girl was
regarding the big jew with the peculiar
expression of half repulsion half fas-
cination which quite expressed the
emotions with which he inspired her

 but where haf you been you
naughty children cried rosenthal
sapristi if you only knew how i
haf worried and if you knew what a
bad time i haf been giving prince
emilio since i discovered it was all his
doing

  his doing echoed dallas

  ah yes you did not guess you
see dimitri was my man and he had
instructions to see that you came to
no harm

  dallas was staring at the jew through
narrow lids and eyes as cold and green
as jade

  so it was all a trap arranged by
you and prince emilio he asked

  let me egsplain protested rosen-
thal we knew of course that you
were in belgrade such foolish boys
because you see you played right into
our hands i vas afraid that thalia
might haf appealed to the turkish and
austrian ministers and then we might
haf had to let her go but i tought
that you would be there and when i
learned you were i sent my man di-
mitri to you he is my confidential
agent

  he was corrected dallas grimly

  rosenthal grinned at him like an in-
dulgent parent

  you shooted him i do not plame
you yes he vas my confidential agent
i haf tem eferywhere you see it all
suited my plans and looked like a very
easy way to get lady thalia safe to
rascia witout any fuss and scandal
i had told dimitri to be sure that no
one vas hurted

  rather tough on dimitri that i

didnt have the same instructions said
dallas ironically

 ah my poor poy you did r-right
ven i had gone emilio bribes dimitri
to haf you two boys shooted he has
nefer forgiven you for that blow in the
face but then he is a pig of aservian
dimitri was to come and say that you
resisted and were shooted which might
have happened

  how did you find this out asked
dallas

  from the gossip that goes over these
hills and then i made emilio confess
it appears that there vas a hermit a
holy man who put a stop to that non-
sense and brought sir chames and
paula to dakabar

  dallas and thalia exchanged glances
of infinite relief

  and sir james servant asked the
girl

  he is tere too sir chames got a
buckshot in his neck but he is not
hurted bad this hermit is now mak-
ing lots of troubles at- dakabar he is
himself albanian he turned to tha-
lia it is ishmi bey

  ishmi bey echoed the girl he
was my fathers dearest friend she
said to dallas and he has a blood
feud with emilio

  rosenthal nodded yes said he
that was a very bad business a band
of emilios burned his house and car-
ried away his vife und daughters
ten he vent avay and nobody knew
what had become of him now he is
back in dakabar gathering the shkip-
etari from all ofer the hills there is
going to be troubles and-he grinned
-myselluf i am not so sorry because
i see a chance to get back my forty
tousand pounds but come children
ve must go

  go where demanded dallas
  rosenthal lifted his bushy eyebrows
  to rascia of course said he
  why not to dakabar

  the jew shook his big head ah


thb popular magazine

my boy you may go if you like but
thalia must come vith me i am fery
sorry but business is business if she
vent back to dakabar she vould spoil
it all und i vould lose my forty tou-
sand pounds

  dallas bit his lower lip and his face
hardened

  look here baron said he sud-
denly we are your prisoners if you
will take us to dakabar i will buy your
filthy silver mines and pay you forty
thousand pounds

  for a moment rosenthal stared his
big eyes opened very wide and their
hazel-colored spots seemed to grow
more accentuated while the outer cor-
ners of his bushy eyebrows were pushed
up until they almost met his grizzled
hair then suddenly he threw back his
great head and roared with laughter
still shouting hoarsely he clapped dal-
las on the shoulder almost knocking
the young man off his feet

  by chingo but it is funny  excuse
me if i laugh mr dallas but it is so
very funny no business is busi-
ness but isidor rosenthal has not yet
turned brigand no tat vould not
be business and again the raucous
laugh burst out to come reechoing back
in hoarse cachinnations from the rocky
wall on the other side of the gorge

  the jew turned and mounted his big
black horse the back of which sagged
under his great bulk he gave a harsh
order in the serbo-croatian tongue at
which two of the troopers dismounted

  come said rosenthal wiping his
eyes with a silk handkerchief heavily
scented with musk we must go chil-
dren get up on these horses no-
he waved his big hand-it is no use
to argue mr dallas you shall leave us
where the road turns off for dakabar
just beyond iverntsk the lady thalia
must come vith me to rascia busi-
ness is business-he laughed again-
but isidor rosenthal is not yet a
brigand

  seeing the utter futility of argument
dallas put thalia on her pony and
mounted himself when rosenthal
wheeled and the little cavalcade moved
forward they descended into the val-
ley of the lim then turned southeast
rosenthal went on ahead followed by
some of his men in the midst of whom
rode dallas and thalia side by side
the dismounted troopers being left to
find their way back on foot as best
they might

  for several miles dallas rode in si-
lence pale and furious and answering
thalias remarks in curt monosyllables

  who are these men he asked
finally

  emilios servants and guards

  soldiers 

  no the only actual militia in this
country are turks you see it is a
turkish sanjak but emilio stands
very well with the porte and he is per-
mitted to maintain a sort of constabu-
lary to protect himself from the shkip-
etari who hate the turks almost as
much as they do the serbs you see
the whole state of affairs is horribly
confused and what the turks want
more than anything else is to keep the
peace as a result they are friendly
with both parties so far as they can
be

  so weve got to part said dallas
bitterly

  thalia looked at him with a sad
smile when you get to dakabar
said she tell ishmi bey not to fight

  it was still early in the afternoon
when the little cavalcade arrived at a
village situated on the bank of the swift
stream

  iverntsk said thalia the peo-
ple of this sadniga were nearly all mas-
sacred a few years ago by one of emil-
ios bands the same old story emil-
ios people are mostly christians of the
bulgarian church and his zadruga be-
longs to the orthodox greek church
a rrincbss of the balkans



that is their method of converting each
other

  the little hamlet appeared deserted
as their troop clattered through oppo-
site a modest edifice of mud and stone
rosenthal drew in his horse tossed the
reins to a trooper and swung his great
body to the ground

  this is a han-a tavern he said to
dallas let us dismount for a cup of
coffee and some olives

  he lifted thalia to the ground as if
she had been a child dallas also dis-
mounted and all three were about to
enter the door of the inn when one of
the troopers called out sharply to a man
who appeared to be the captain of the
guard

  what is that said rosenthal
does he say that there are horsemen
coming

  he raised his hand for silence and
for a moment they stood listening the
white dusty road led straight through
the village the small houses built close
together and facing it on either side
at the extreme end of the street there
was a high mud wall above which one
saw the dull green foliage of an olive
orchard and beyond the roof of a
rather more elaborate dwelling than the
others apparently the home of the pa-
triarch or communal head of the sa-
druga in front of this estate the road
turned sharply at a right angle and was
hid from view by some low mud cot-
tages

  from this direction there came the
distant rumble of many hoofs the
sound rapidly increased in volume in-
dicating that whatever the party which
approached it was traveling at a rapid
pace rosenthals serbs were glancing
from one to the other with knit brows
and muttering interrogations while the
face of the big jew himself wore an
expression of extreme disgust

  sapristi he growled who can
this be he called out sharply to his

captain who shrugged and answered
a few guttural words

  a turkish hamdie muttered ro-
senthal scowling peste but that
will be embarrassing i have no official
permission to be leading a troop of
armed men through these hills the
commanding officer will ask awkward
questions he will want to know why
i did not refer this matter of looking
for the lady thalia to him -

  and i shall tell him said thalia
maliciously

  rosenthal threw her a look of re-
proach

  peste he growled you would
not do that you would not do any-
thing so ungrateful

  dallas laughed outright and the jew
grinned at the same moment the rum-
ble which had developed into a sharp
clatter of many hoofs diminished a
cloud of dust rose suddenly over the
low tiled roofs at the end of the street
and the next moment the head of a
column of horsemen turned the corner
then quickly halted

  there was a moment of silence fol-
lowed instantly by a clamor of voices
from rosenthals men and a sharp or-
der from the captain

  the troop was thrown into confu-
sion with an oath rosenthal sprang
to mount his horse with one hand on
the animals neck and one foot in the
stirrup he turned to look at dallas
over his shoulder

  get out of the way he cried
harshly into the han there is going
to be a fight

  but dallas and the girl had scarcely
heard his words their eyes were riv-
eted on the horsemen clustered at the
bend of the road for at their head were
sir james connors and a tall bearded
man in fez and tunic who even as they
looked snatched the yataghan from his
sash and whirled the blade above his
head

  the shkipetari cried thalia


the popular magazine

  rosenthals men taken completely by
surprise were struggling to unsling
their carbines but the albanian leader
gave them scant time swinging in
his saddle he shouted a harsh order
and pointed toward rosenthals serbs
with the blade of his yataghan the
next instant the shkipetari were hurled
in assault

  dallas had barely time to drag thalia
up the steps and into the han before the
albanians had struck their enemy the
street was narrow and the powdery
dust of the road swept up in such dense
swirling clouds that for several mo-
ments it was impossible to follow the
fortunes of the fight horses and men
were down and the combatants were
so tightly wedged as to be unable to
use rifle or carbine but the yataghans
were busy and presently as the dust
slightly settled the two in the doorway
of the han were able to see what was
happening

  sir james his face as fierce as any
of the savage ones about him was firing
to right and left once at the elbow
of the englishman they caught sight
of connors who had emptied his re-
volver and was fighting with the steel
like those about him a moment later
a gaunt black-bearded man came hew-
ing his way through with blows of
terrific force and quickness while his
fierce face peered constantly this way
and that as if in search of some one

  thalia put her lips close to dallas
ear that is ishmi bey she said

  but the pivotal center of the fight
was rosenthal squarely in the middle
of the street the jews big bulk loomed
through the swirling dust while his
harsh voice admonishing friend and
foe rose above the din of the fight
he had been armed only with a carbine
but as the crush was so thick he had
seized the weapon by the muzzle and
used it as a club

  the uproar was appalling above
the clash and clatter of steel rose the

yells of the shkipetari and the screams
of the wounded men and stricken
horses but over all blared out from
time to time the deep-chested roar of
the jew the serbs were fighting for
their lives knowing well that no quar-
ter would be given by their savage
kilted enemies to whom such slaughter
was as the very breath of their nos-
trils the shkipetari were consider-
ably fewer in numbers but no living
bone and muscle could withstand the
fury of their attack backward down
the road they forced the serbs while
the blinding dust rose thicker and
thicker rosenthal alone appeared to
hold his own planted in the middle of
the street he fought like a huge rag-
ing mephistopheles his clothes in rib-
bons and the blood streaming down his
satanic face now and then dallas
caught a glimpse of sir james the
englishman had torn the carbine from
the hands of a serb and was fighting
like the jew his weapon clubbed back-
ward the serbs were forced struggling
over the bodies of men and horses until
presently rosenthal alone blocked the
road ishmi bey had fought his way
on past him and was the center of a
swirling vortex his streaming yataghan
flashing up and down like a tongue of
red flame

  by this time many of the albanians
were on their feet leaping here and
there now pausing to thrust at a fallen
enemy or springing  aside to lash at a
mounted one then a rift in the swirl-
ing dust showed sir james knee to knee
with rosenthal dallas saw the jew
strike a savage blow which the eng-
lishman parried with a hoarse shout
rosenthal raised in his stirrups to
strike again when connors who had
stuck close to the elbow of his master
sprang forward and cut savagely at
the jew with his yataghan rosenthal
parried with his gun barrel but the
blade glanced and found the side of
his shaggy head the jew swayed in
a princess of the balkans



his saddle then lurched sideways and
came crashing to the ground

  sir james and connors wheeled to
plunge again into the fight which had
surged on down the street dallas
leaped from the doorway and seizing
rosenthal under the arms dragged his
huge bulk across the threshold of the
inn the road was strewn with men
and horses while the fight itself was
completely veiled in the swimming
clouds of dust which presently began
to dissolve when from the distance
came the sound of scampering hoofs
what was left of the servian troop had
broken into flight

  dallas and thalia stared at each
other with pale faces at their feet the
body of the big jew heaved convul-
sively then struggled to a sitting pos-
ture from head to foot the man was
a grimy mass of blood and dust and his
breath was coming in great labored
gasps for a moment he looked about
vacantly then the expression came back
into the big brown eyes with their mul-
tiple hazel dots

  mein gott he panted it vas riot
vort it forty tousand pounds  bah
he raised both hands to a long jagged
cut on the side of his head from which
the blood was oozing sluggishly

  so youre not dead  said dallas

  i dont tink so but i deserf to
be forty tousand pounds bah
he spat and wiped his mouth with the
back of his grimy sleeve then looked up
at thalia and grinned

  sapristi i do not like to fight it
is not goot business and bad for the
health sapristi but it is very bad
for the health i might easily have
been killed and then of what good
would be my forty tousand pounds
and tink of the grief of my dear vife
in buda-pesth but vat could i do 
he spread out his grimy hands apolo-
getically you cannot arbitrate ven a
friend is clubbing at you vit a gun
barrel

  let me tie up your head said
thalia

  tanks sir chames is a goot boy
it vould haf broken my heart to haf
split his skull mein gott vat a busi-
ness 

chapter xii

  dallas and thalia with the assist-
ance of a few of the frightened villag-
ers were doing what they could for the
wounded when up rode sir james and
connors both covered from head to
foot with blood and dust but neither
seriously hurt some distance behind
them strode the tall bearded man whom
thalia had recognized as the hermit
ishmi bey

  sir james dismounted and came to-
ward them his grimy face glowing with
delight

  thank god he cried huskily we
had almost given you up we were 
starting out to look for you this morn-
ing when we ran headfirst into this
gang of emilios i tried to prevent a
row but there was no holding ishmi
bey and the shkipetari

  he took thalias hand in both of his
and carried it to his lips then turned
to dallas with glistening eyes

 might have known youd win
through old chap i say that was a
ripping shot you made on dimitri it
was all a put-up job of those two scoun-
drels rosenthal and emilio

  rosenthal had nothing to do with
the plan to murder us said dallas

  didnt he im glad of that it
didnt seem to me like the old baron
to play that sort of a filthy game too
bad if we had known that wed have
passed him by just now

hes not much hurt said dallas

  sir james face expressed relief
glad of it said he heartily then
glanced up to see the baron himself
standing in the door of the han his
head swathed in bandages

  hello baron called the english-


the cpocpulacr magazine

man heartily glad you were not killed
old chap

  tanks and i am glad you were
not hurted sir chames this fight vas
not of my choosing now i am fin-
ished my forty tousand pounds can
go to the devil i am not afraid to say
ven i am beat vonce i vas beaten in
macao by a chinaman and vonce in
hayti by a nigger named fouchere
now i am beat in the balkans by two
boys and two girls he grinned

  sir james looked about him and
shook his head

  nasty work said he but there
was no help for it when our crowd
saw these people of emilios they went
crazy we had better get to dakabar
as soon as we can or there will be a
hanged sight worse row than this the
shkipetari have been pouring in from
the mountains and nothing will do but
they must attack emilio

  how is paula dallas asked

  a peculiar expression of embarrass-
ment appeared on the battle-stained face
of the englishman

  she is very well but awfully wor-
ried about you two

  ishmi bey had greeted thalia and
the two were talking in low tones the
surviving albanians had come strag-
gling back a few mounted and some on
foot there was not a man of them
who did not carry some wound

  lets get out of this said sir
james before we have a turkish
zap tie down on our backs the whole
thing is a bit irregular

  how about the wounded asked
dallas

  sir james shrugged the villagers
will have to look after them they
will do it i fancy for fear of both
parties he turned to rosenthal
how did you leave the dear prince
baron

  i am finished vit emilio he an-
swered harshly i do not hold vit
murderers and assassins sir chames

if you do not object i vill go to dak-
abar

chapter xiii

  two hours later found them winding
up into the hills at the head of the
cavalcade strode the tall gaunt figure
of ishmi bey walking at the stirrup of
the lady thalia with whom he was in
earnest conversation a short distance
behind them rosenthal rode alone sit-
ting his big horse droopingly a huge
and somewhat dejected figure with his
massive head swathed in bandages sir
james and dallas came next followed
by connors and such of the albanians
as were fit to travel

  there is going to be the very deuce
of a row stephen said sir james
the most of the inhabitants of this
sanjak of novibazar are south sla-
vonic serbs this whole district is the
cradle of the servian race and the
prince emilio is the ranking feudal
chief thalia on the other hand is
pure albanian only connected to emilio
by marriage and her people are all
albanian grseco-latin stock and de-
scendants of the ancient illyrians they
have no fixed religion they are chris-
tians of both greek and bulgarian
churches and mohammedans of all
grades the turks first drove them up
into these hills and so they hate the
turks and the serbs have always been
trying to drive hem back again and
so they hate the serbs also they are
forever fighting among themselves and
so they hate one another

  a cheerful crowd observed dallas

  are they not they have always
got to be fighting somebody when
constantine bey thalias father was
alive he did a lot to keep the peace and
in reward got assassinated himself his
friend and cousin ishmi bey laid the
murder to emilos door and emilo
discovered it and one night paid him
a visit and burned his castle and car-
ried off his womenkind
a princess of the balkans



  nice young man emilio

 quite so he appears to have
formed the habit ishmi bey was not
strong enough to retaliate and finally
appears to have decided that he was
cursed of allah and hauled off into
the woods and built himself the cabin
which you and thalia found and
turned holy man when he heard the
firing he came across the river and
persuaded the herders to clear out and
then conducted us to dakabar we
did not worry about you as much as we
might have done because one of the
herders came back and said that you
had shot three of the gang and got
across the river unhurt so we hurried
along hoping to overtake you on the
trail to dakabar it never occurred to
us that you might be wounded as the
last that we heard was the crack of
your -

  dallas nodded i should not have
been shot if i hadnt been a fool he
said

  when we found nothing of you
continued sir james we hurried on
to dakabar collected a mounted force
and came back the next day to look for
you this is the third searching expe-
dition that we have made and this time
we took a strong party with the idea
of combing the hills all over the place
until we got some news of you mean-
while ishmi bey has passed the word
into the hills that the prince emilio has
tried to murder the lady thalia and
her party and the shkipetari have been
pouring into dakabar from all sides
there must be five hundred of them
there now all spoiling for a fight and
i do not think that thalia and ishmi
bey combined can keep them from at-
tacking emilio within the next forty-
eight hours they are led by a crazy
fanatic sheik izzat and they mean to
make a clean sweep of emilio and all
his tribe

  i should like to be at the party
said dallas

  so should i weve got a little score
with emilio suppose we go along
all right i might even so far for-
get myself as to take a snapshot at his
highness if opportunity offered how
did paula stand the ordeal

  sir james glanced up quickly and his
swarthy color grew slightly darker
dallas staring between his ponys ears
failed to observe the confusion of his
friend

  like a veteran answered sir
james i got a slug through the mus-
cles of the neck and she- he

paused awkwardly dallas intent on
his own thoughts did not notice it for
a while the two friends rode in silence
then sir james remarked in a voice
slightly different from his usual tone
odd how sharing mutual danger ap-
pears to draw people together

  dallas glanced at him sharply why
shouldnt it he asked

  sir james swarthy color deepened
and for a moment he did not answer

  look here stephen he turned
abruptly to his friend do you con-
sider that a situation can arise such
as-er-the sharing of mutual danger
which could possibly justify-or at least
-hm-ah-extenuate the circum-
stance of a mans forgetting his duty
to a friend where-hm-ah-a woman
was concerned

  dallas turned and stared at him with
a rigid face he could scarcely be-
lieve his ears he had intended at the
first opportunity to tell sir james of
all that had passed between thalia and
himself and to offer such amends as
lay within his power but to be as he
supposed subjected to an inquisition
which was founded on mere suspicior-
and narrow-minded jealousy aroused
his quick and keen resentment

  sir james met the steely look and his
own face hardened then he glanced
away flushing crimsonly and began to
tug at his wiry mustache

  no said dallas curtly i dont
do you

  er-er-no answered sir james
then blurted out theoretically
dallas regarded him through nar-
rowed lids

  suppose we drop the woman part
of it james said he in his coldest
voice until we get this other business
off our hands

  quite so said sir james and the
two fell silent again

chapter xiv

  the full hunters moon hanging
poised above the silvery crest of the
dovo-dagh looked down upon a wild
and savage host as it wound up through
the forested defiles of the north alba-
nian alps

  for the shkipetari were afoot and
moving swiftly and silently to strike at
the throat of their hereditary foe an
odd five hundred mountaineers had ral-
lied at the hot message sent into the hills
by ishmi bey holy man and martyr to
the cruelty of prince emilio foul
wrong had been done to the lady tha-
lia daughter of their hereditary chief
and even more and that which brought
a savage oath to the lips of every
shaggy arnaut to whom the message
reached the prince was plotting to sell
themselves and their free hills to the
hated servians

  for several days they had come drop-
ping into dakabar singly or in squads
fierce-visaged fathers had stalked
down from their mountain fastnesses
their half-grown sons at their heels
many were of different sects blood
enemies victims or- victors of sangui-
nary family feuds but these while
eying askance the members of rival
clans had laid aside their private
wrongs for the common cause 

  arms and costumes differed widely
there were men clad only in sheep-
skins with the wool turned in and

  tight-fitting caps of white others were
more elaborately dressed in kalpaks of
black wool sometimes of astrakhan
with short full-sleeved tunics white
kilts woolen stockings and shoes of
ted leather with tufts of black wool
upon the toes nearly all the men car-
ried guns-long weapons with narrow
barrels often richly ornamented with
traceries and patterns wrought in silver
and gold every one was armed with
the weapon so dear to the native heart
the yataghan

  there were sheiks among them and
priests of both greek and bulgarian
churches who eyed each other askance
and with more vindictiveness than they
did the devotees of islam the entire
horde-for it could scarcely be called
an army-was under the nominal com-
mand of one sheik izzat himself a
hermit who had gone half mad as the
result of wrong dealt him by the turks
but once in motion there was no pre-
tense of leadership the object of the
expedition as understood by all was to
strike a final and fatal blow at the
hated stronghold of the prince and
every man would fight his own fight in
his own way

  so as they strode along with the
swift springy step of the mountaineer
there was no dissension in the ranks
mussulman jostled shoulders with
christian pastoral feuds between herd-
ers and maize growers were forgotten
men from different valleys looked at
each other for the first time without
the hand going to the hilt of the yata-
ghan if there were any rivalry it was
only as to who should strike first hard-
est and last

  at the head of the column if so
it could be called sir james rode at the
side of ishmi bey with whom he con-
versed in french the holy man had
done his best to persuade the moun-
taineers to return peacefully to their
homes but once gathered it had
proven impossible to disband them in
a princess of the balkans



the end they had clamored for sheik
izzat to lead them against rascia when
ishmi bey had accompanied the horde
in the hope of giving such direction as
he could to the evolutions of what was
little better than a savage mob

  for some distance the road passed
through heavy forest the wind was
blowing a clear gale overhead the
treetops swayed and crashed filling the
air with their flying leaves while the
brilliant moonlight filtered through in
swirling splashes of silvery light

  they wound up through a defile
skirted the flank of a mountain and
emerged presently upon a bare bowl-
der-strewn hillside against which the
moon blazed with startling brilliancy
the path ascended in a series of zig-
zags and at the top of the wind-swept
ridge ishmi bey drew rein dallas
and connors slipped from their horses
and the four men turned to look back
upon the following shkipetari

  the effect was curious and startling
below them the vivid moonlight shone
and glittered from the huge fantastic
bowlders which were composed of a
gneiss and mica schist and which
flashed back the shimmering rays until
all the hillside seemed a vast heap of
gleaming gems blackest shadows lay
here and there alternating patches of
glowing moonlight slipping invisibly
from these areas of gloom to flitter
across the patches of bright light came
a swarm of leaping figures now ap-
pearing now disappearing suggesting
trolls issuing from the depths of the
earth to pilfer a titan treasure-trove
ignoring the zigzag path they came
springing straight up the steep hillside
and as they crossed the open spaces
the yataghans and the gun barrels
threw back the brilliant moon rays in
flashes of pale-blue flame

  far beneath the still valley slum-
bered under a light veil of mist through
which shone faintly the silvered glint
of the river on all sides tumbled

the rough shoulders of the hills their
crests rimmed with white fire and
shadows of wondrous depths upon
their breasts over the ridge swept the
high wind in clear cold blasts

  the route led along the top of the
hill then down a bare slope to the stony
bed of a torrential stream the water
of which was very low and could be
seen only in broad standing pools
the gully worn by the cataract was
over one hundred yards in width and
choked with masses of loose rock and
stone beyond it the bank rose steeply
to meet the heavy forest and a little
distance downstream there was a rift
between the hills which marked the
course of the trail to rascia

  as ishmi bey was indicating this
opening to sir james there suddenly
emerged from the gloom of the forest
a little squad of horsemen which rode
out into the full light of the moon
where it halted as if to reconnoiter

  the hermit reined his pony sharply
backward under the crest of the hill
and sir james did likewise

  who are those men  whispered
ishmi bey our own scouts were
unmounted let us watch for a mo-
ment

  the shkipetari were springing up
all about them ishmi bey turned and
gave a sharp order in the guttural gegh
dialect spoken by the tribes who live
north of the river shkumbi the
words were passed quickly from mouth
to mouth and the tribesmen sank to
earth then crawled up to peer down
into the valley beneath

  the horsemen had disappeared
against the shadow of the forest a
few moments later they came into sight
again in the river bottom dismounted
and leading their horses among the
stones presently they passed under
the near bank and were lost to view
to reappear immediately at the foot of
the slope here they paused as if in
consultation and seemed to scan the


the pocpulacr magazine

ridge above perhaps some instinct
warned them of the ambush spread
along its summit for they seemed un-
willing to proceed they were still
standing there inky blotches against the
brilliant background when a dark col-
umn began to emerge from the forest
across the valley

  a guttural whisper arose from the
shkipetari its sibilant undertone was
caught up in the fierce gusts of wind
and swept from mouth to mouth ishmi
bey crouching beside  sir james
turned his head and his white teeth
shone through his heavy beard

  the prince he muttered in french
he has heard that the shkipetari were
mustering to attack him at rascia and
has decided to strike first himself at
dakabar

  across the river the dark column
crawled like a thick black serpent from
the forest turned to the left and dis-
appeared again in the sightless shad-
ows which cloaked the rim of the bank
a troop of cavalry had appeared and
apparently halted when a column of
infantry followed and likewise disap-
peared

  it is but a mouthful for the shkip-
etari whispered ishmi bey exult-
antly there are perhaps fifty horse-
men and twice that number of foot
while we are over five hundred strong
we will strike when the cavalry is
crossing the river bed

  he hurried off in search of sheik
izzat and a moment later the two dark
figures could be seen flitting here and
there among the mountaineers

  at the foot of the slope the horse-
men forming the advance guard had
remounted and were riding slowly up
the hill at the same time the forward
files of the cavalry came out of a
gully in the opposite bank leading
their horses among the bowlders and
debris until presently the entire col-
umn was in the river bed the scouts
were advancing slowly and as if in

doubt for those in ambush could see
the white moonlight on their faces as
they turned them continually upward

  the six doomed men were within
fifty yards of the summit when the
sheik izzat sprang suddenly to his feet
and with a savage scream waved his
ataghan aloft his cry was lost in
the crash of a volley the detonation
of which was whirled on high and
swept away on the gusty winds down
went horses and riders a struggling
heap up rose the shkipetari but even
more quickly ishmi bey had sprung in
front of them and was waving them
back with frantic words and furious
gestures

  for a moment they paused ishmi
bey a mad whirling figure in the
moonlight poured out a frenzied tor-
rent of speech a few of the shkipe-
tari sprang forward but the hermit
giant that he was seized them by the
shoulders and flung them back then
sheik izzat the blade of his yataghan
a glittering circle over his head plunged
down the slope howling furiously
with a roar the shkipetari were on
and after him

  ishmi bey who had been overthrown
by the rush sprang to his feet and
shook his clenched fists with a gesture
of passionate despair he turned to-
ward sir james and cried out some-
thing which dallas could not hear but
the englishman had understood he
looked at his friend with a pale and
horror-stricken face

  good heaven he cried it is not
the prince at all those are turkish
troops

  silent and dismayed they watched
the furious combat in the valley be-
neath although more than doubly
outnumbered surprised and taken at a
disadvantage the turkish hamdie was
not thrown into confusion well
drilled well disciplined well officered
and well armed the shkipetari could
not have found in all the country a
a cptrincess of the balkans



more difficult mouthful to swallow than
the turkish mounted militia

  at the first wild clamor and volley
from the hilltop there had been a quick
sharp order and in the two minutes
which it took the tribesmen to reach
the foot of the hill the troopers had
unslung their carbines released their
horses and were deployed among the
rocks at the same moment the com-
pany of infantry which was marching
in column of fours and hidden in the
shadow of the woods was halted then
advanced in line of skirmishers along
the farther bank so that when the
shkipetari reached the watercourse
they ran pell-mell into a very nasty
trap had they possessed any leader-
ship or tactics they might have halted
and deployed on their own bank when
they could have engaged the enemy
under fire and effected considerable
damage but frenzied as they were
when once started there was no hold-
ing them down they poured into the
watercourse yataghan in hand only
to be met by a volley at point-blank
range from turkish mausers in the
hands of marksmen who needed noth-
ing better than the brilliant moonlight

  but although a number fell the
tribesmen did not waver into the
rocks they leaped agile as otter hounds
and just as fierce and here the slaugh-
ter began for the yataghan although
an admirable weapon when opposed to
steel stands little chance against a bul-
let and it was steel-jacketed lead at
close range with which the troopers
ted them then after the first few mo-
ments of scattering fire finding noth-
ing at which to aim in the leaping
darting figures here came the infantry
charging down the bank with fixed bay-
onets when the engagement promptly
broke into a series of furious hand-to-
hand combats

  if the shkipetari came to recognize
iheir mistake in the identity of their
foe they did not seek to remedy it

the battle rage had seized them and
the turks themselves though not the
folk whom they had come to seek were
their hereditary enemies straight into
the muzzles of the rifles rushed the
albanians and in the bright light of
the moon the watchers on the hilltop
were witnesses to acts of the most des-
perate fury here a screaming moun-
taineer took a bullet through the body
at a range of two yards only to rush
in and beat aside the soldiers rifle and
cut him down with the yatghan near
him an albanian with a bayonet
through his vitals was striving to reach
with a thrust of his long sinewy arm
the man who held it wounded shkip-
etari crawled on hands and knees to
get within striking distance of a foe
praying only to kill one man before
death overtook them

  yet for all of their frenzied fighting
the injury inflicted by the shkipetari
was but very slight while that which
they suffered was terrific in less time
than it takes to tell a third of them
were down and then as though rec-
ognizing the hopelessness of the strug-
gle the tribesmen suddenly lost heart
and the place was filled with flying fig-
ures retreating not back in the direc-
tion whence they had come but on
down the watercourse toward a spot
where the forest grew to the edge of
the bank a moment later they had
melted into the sheltering woods leav-
ing only their dead and dying and a
few dark figures crawling away to hide
in recesses among the rocks

  sir james turned to dallas a face
which was drawn and tense

  how do you feel

  rather sick and you

  what a beastly shame that in-
fernal fool f a sheik

  ishmi bey crouching in front of
them rose to his feet

  what can one do with madmen
he asked throwing out his hands i
had just recognized the uniform of the


the popular magazine

hamdie when sheik izzat gave the or-
der to fire come my friends we must
go if we are found here we shall
be shot

  they crawled back over the ridge
remounted their ponies and rode in
silence back down the trail at the
end of an hour the road led out upon
a wind-swept ridge and they saw be-
low them the village of dakabar

  the work of to-night is an example
of the guile of prince emilio said
ishmi bey bitterly as they rode down
the steep hillside he heard of the
coming of the shkipetari and sent word
of it to the nearest turkish caracol
now the work has been done for him
at no cost and we may expect to see
him here at dakabar with a band of his
serbs

  the house of the lady thalia was
situated on a thickly wooded plateau a
little above the village and was sur-
rounded by a park as the four men
rode in through the massive gates they
saw at the far end of the straight ave-
nue several horses standing in the
bright patch of moonlight in front of
the main entrance to the house

  halt said ishmi bey under his
breath

  they drew rein and peered down the
dark tunneled driveway overhead
the high wind was roaring through the
treetops but the foliage was still thick
enough to screen the light of the moon

  who can that be whispered sir
james

  i do not know answered the her-
mit perhaps it is the prince himself
let us go forward quietly

  they advanced cautiously almost
at the end of the drive they again drew
rein

  in front of the door were six horses
saddled and bridled and held by three
men suddenly one of the animals
raised its head and whinnied when be-
fore he could prevent it dallas mount
neighed in answer

  the three unmounted men turned
quickly and stared down the drive
then one of them handed his reins to
a comrade ran up the steps and rapped
sharply on the big oaken door im-
mediately t was swung open showing
a lighted interior and a moment later
a short thickset figure stepped across
the threshold and stood for a moment
in the full blaze of the moon

  dallas heard at his elbow a quick
indrawn breath and turned to see ishmi
bey his head thrust forward like a
hound in leash

  the prince growled the hermit
and drew his yataghan

  dallas leaned toward sir james it
is emilio he whispered he has
come for thalia

  sir james answer was to draw his
own blade he turned to ishmi bey

  there are only six of them said
he lets make a rush

  hold on said dallas this is
pistol work james

  steel for me ready connors 
nivir more so sorr growled the
irishman and drew his heavy revolver
then come on

  the gravel churned under the ponies
hoofs as they sprang forward out of
the shadow they flew neck and neck
and dashed across the lighted space
a cry burst from the prince and they
saw him snatch a pistol from his belt
the horses held by the two troopers
frightened by the crash of hoofs
tugged violently backward dragging
the men after them

  at the first alarm two more men had
appeared in the wide open doorway
the prince raised his weapon and fired
at the foot of the steps dallas reined
in with a jerk and began to shoot from
the saddle pank pank pank
barked the deadly automatic arm and
one of the men beside the prince pitched
forward and came headfirst down into
the road but dallas horse fright-
ened at the reports was fighting to bolt
a princess of the balkans



and the other shots flew wide ishmi
bey was on his feet and leaping for
the steps connors had killed one
guard and wounded the other but sir
james pony struck by a bullet from
the princes weapon had reared and
fallen backward across his rider pin-
ning him to the ground

  dallas swung from the saddle and
rushed after the hermit and connors
pausing to haul sir james from under
his horse followed him at the top
of the steps the man beside the prince
thrust his revolver almost against the
broad chest of ishmi bey and fired
then leaped back across the threshold
dragging the prince after him and
swung to the heavy door but ishmi
bey who had reeled backward when
shot recovered himself and lurching
forward thrust the blade of his yata-
ghan between the door and the jamb
when all four men threw their weights
against it slowly it gave to the noise
of scuffling feet within then a blade
licked out through the aperture and
connors dropped with an oath and
went rolling down the steps

  stand clear panted dallas and
drawing back fired two shots through
the oak panel at the same moment
the door swung violently open and
they burst into the room

  two thundering reports roared out
and ishmi bey staggered back against
the wall a swarthy man sprang at
sir james with a wicked slash of a
cavalry saber but the englishman
caught the blow on his yataghan then
thrust his antagonist through the body
dallas peering under the smoke saw
the prince and another man standing
behind a large table in the middle of
the room he fired quickly into the
smoke and saw the man at the princes
elbow fall then the prince himself
iired and dallas felt the wind of the
bullet on his- cheek at the same mo-
ment ishmi bey sprang forward when
the prince turned and ran to a door

at the far end of the hall with his
hand on the latch the hermit overtook
him driving his yataghan so violently
between the princes shoulders that the
blade transfixed the panel of the door

  at dallas right there rose the clash
and clatter of steel and he turned to
see sir james engaged with a man who
had been hiding behind the arras at
the other end of the hall the room
was dimly lighted by three lamps but
the farther recesses were buried in
shadow and as dallas glanced warily
about his quick eye was caught by a
moving figure in one of these his
deadly weapon flew up and even as it
did so a scream from sir james an-
tagonist told that the duel was finished
simultaneously there boomed out from
the lower end of the hall a harsh and
raucous voice

  dont shoot it vas i-rosenthal-
and the ladies

  dallas lowered his weapon staring
in amazement through the heavy suf-
focating smoke sir james was lean-
ing against the table looking in the
same direction his breath coming in
gasps and a thin red stream running
from the point of his yataghan at the
end of the hall lay the bodies of ishmi
bey and the prince emilio whose death
struggle had snapped the blade which
transfixed him dallas crouched lower
to peer under the blinding smoke

  in the extreme corner of the room
the huge bulk of the jew was dimly
defined through the vaporous gloom
he was standing erect his big arms
spread out his hands braced against
the wall on either side as the two
men stared the jew who had been
looking cautiously to right and left let
his arms drop to his side and stepped
forward when there appeared to their
astonished eyes the dark-clad figures of
the lady thalia and the countess
paula rubitzki

  you can come oudt ladies said
rosenthal it is all ofer


the popular magazine

  upon ray word gasped sir james
have you been there all the time

  yes sir chames there vas no
time to get oudt of the vay you came
so quickly i vas afraid the ladies
might get shooted so i pushed them
into the comer and stood in fr-r-ont
of them mein gott a bullet went into
the wall an inch from my head i can
see noting for the plaster in my eyes

  good for you grunted dallas

  the two girls came forward shrink-
ingly their faces very pale and their
eyes wide with horror for the room
was a smoke-filled shambles

  wheres connors asked sir james
suddenly

  he got a sword thrust said dallas
and rolled down the steps as we came
in

  sir james went quickly out the
others dazed by the violence through
which they had just passed stood for
an instant regarding one another in
silence then dallas started on a tour
of inspection accompanied by rosen-
thal whose massive head was still
swathed in bandages

  ishmi bey and the prince were both
quite dead so was the man at whom
dallas had fired while the two vic-
tims of sir james yataghan appeared
to be dying both having been run
through the chest

  sapristi said rosenthal how
far hate will take a man especially
when he is a holy man here is ishmi
bey with four bullet holes in his body
one of them over the heart and yet he
has lived to kill the prince

  as he spoke sir james entered the
room the englishmans eyes were
brimming over and his face was pale
and drawn

  dead asked dallas

  sir james could only nod followed
by rosenthal dallas hurried out of the
house they found the brave irish-
man lying on his back at the foot of

the steps stone dead his revolver still
clenched in his hand

  as they reentered dallas paused on
the threshold sir james had sunk into
a chair his elbows on the table his
chin on his knuckles staring into va-
cancy beside him stood paula her
hand resting on his shoulder dallas
looked and suddenly understood his
gray eyes opened very wide he
stepped quickly to his friend

  james old chap i am sorry

  rosenthals heavy voice broke the
silence which followed

  where are the shkipetari  what
happened you

  in a few brief words dallas told the
jew of what had befallen the alba-
nians rosenthals face grew very
grave

  sapristi ye must get oudt of here
at vonce the turks vill hold thalia
responsible come sir chames let us
bury your man and get a vay thalia
find your servants and haf them saddle
some horses ye must lose no time to
get across the border into monte-
negro 

chapter xv

  a soft breeze from the adriatic
sighed and whispered through the lofty
tops of the great pines which rose
straight and dark and solemn from the
brim of the high plateau the yellow
moon which two nights before had
looked down cold and bright and mer-
ciless upon the slaughter of the shkipe-
tari now shone with a fervor almost
caressing in its luscious warmth tem-
pered by the soft air from the sea

  far below the rolling hills swelled
away to infinity bathed in luminous
disorder their crests converted into
islands of enchantment rising from the
sea of mist which filled the valleys

  side by side at the foot of one of
the big forest sentinels dallas and the
lady thalia sat upon the carpet of
aromatic pine needles and looked out
a princess of the balkans



upon the moonlit wilderness not far
beneath them on the mountainside
there sparkled a light or two from the
little inn where the refugees had halted
for the night

  presently dallas spoke his voice sub-
dued to the murmur of the gentle
breeze in the treetops high above their
heads

  dear to-morrow you will have to
say good-by to your savage mountains
cettinje is over there-he pointed to-
ward the vague distance before them

  am i never to see my hills again
stephen  asked the girl

  its hard to tell sweetheart per-
haps some day we may come back for
a visit but your home is going to be
very far away from them

  where dearest 

  in my own country thalia ive
been too long away we americans
are not built for the silly aimless life
that ive been leading we are meant
for strife and action and keen effort

  you are she nestled closer

  im afraid said dallas that im
not as civilized as i thought i was
do you know dear i have never felt
so fit and happy in my life as i have
back there in your hills the hardship
and the danger and all seemed to fill
some long-felt want i could never go
back to the insipid life in paris after
this

  im glad stephen i am not so very
tame myself you know she laughed
caressingly and took his hand in both
of hers were well mated arent we
dear

  lie drew her to him and held her
there his lips resting against her cheek

  i am afraid that we are two sav-
ages dear your fathers were shkipe-
tari and spent their time in carving the
turks with their yataghans mine were
texas rangers and spent their time in
carving up greasers with bowie knives
theres not much to choose  then you
and i come along and are sent to school

ca

in france and told to be polite and
at the very first chance we trot out and
shoot up the country as naturally and
joyfully as if we had been taught to do
it but it shows me where i really
belong and of course you belong with
me

  thalia seized his wrists and turned
to stare at him with large and startled
eyes

  do you mean that you are going
back to america to fight with-what do
you call them-greasers and in-
dians perhaps  oh no no stephen 
what if you should be killed 

  dallas took her in his arms no
darling said he those days are
past we are going to be married and
live in a peaceful country enough btit
one where a man does a mans work
-and makes other men do it too i
dont know what mine will be but i
have inherited big responsibilities dear
-railroads and factories and great
tracts of lialf-savage country to be de-
veloped-and i am going back to de-
velop it-and myself and you shall
help j 

  i shall try dear thalias voice
was tremulous do you think that i
can really help and oh stephen-
a sob rose in her throat-will you love
me always and truly when you have
me all alone in that big far-away coun-
try of yours she hid her face in
his chest

  dallas clasped her in his arms then
raised her face and kissed her warm
trembling lips

  thalia darling if you only
knew he whispered i keep asking
myself what i have ever done to de-
serve such a woman resolute cheer-
ful fearless and tender ah my dear
if you only knew

  her arms tightened about his neck
her face crushed to his but the night
wind from the valley seemed to whisper
to the murmuring pines

  truly and always

  as peace advocates who came to this
country to help to prevent bloodshed
said sir james a few nights later as
he and dallas watched the lights of
cettinje dwindling over the taffrail of
the steamer it strikes me that we have
proved pretty gorgeous failures ste-
phen poor old connors he caught
his breath and stared moodily into the
sea

  dont take it so much to heart
james connors was a soldier and he
died a soldiers death he is much
happier than he would be if you had
been the one to get that thrust through
the heart

  but i got him into it it was his
loyalty to me oh hang it all why
couldnt it have been i

  because my son the high gods have
chosen you to marry paula rubitzki
and muzzle the hounds of the secret
service just as they selected me to
marry thalia-for what merit of mine
i am sure i dont know

  perhaps thalia does and i say
stephen it was a ripping little fight
there was a hoarse chuckle from the
door of the smoking room behind them
and rosenthals huge bulk obscured the
bright light from within

  bah said he but you anglo-
saxons vill never get civilized you
can tink of noting but fighting some

 day when you are older you vill under-
 stand like me vat foolish boys you

 -	haf been 

   at least we did what we set out to
 do baron said sir james

  yes and a great deal more ro-
senthals harsh laugh ripped its way
through the peaceful night and now
you are to be married and happy like
me and i am fery glad because it
makes me feel as if my forty tousand
pounds had not been trown avay

   two white-clad figures appeared at
the head of the after companionway
and dallas whose eyes had not strayed
far from that part of the deck turned
quickly on his heel

   sir james thrust himself back from
the rail we are going to watch the
moon rise said he to the baron

  yes then i vill vish you good
night

   rosenthal looked after the two young
 men and a deep laugh rumbled in his
 chest

   sapristi he muttered to himself
 isidor rosenthal has played many
 parts but he has never learned to be
 a chaperon such foolish boys he
 muttered but not so foolish after
 all

   and he turned to the cheerful glare

the miracle mix-up

by albert payson terhune
author of  the man who could do everything   the brick etc

   the plight of an american somewhere in the land of moab about sev-
enty miles from jerusalem who starts to develop an antimony mine only
to be confronted with the tidings that fathma the favorite wife of all the
lion of allah is buried there and to disturb her bones means to let loose
upon the desecrators a horde of oriental hobgoblins

and furthermore howaji fin-
ished najib he is a scourge
this welee-a hell person-
pretty bad

  kirby solemnly drew out a packet of
deuxieme qualite cigarettes with equal
solemnity shredded the paper from
four of them and stuffed the resultant
handful of free tobacco into his smelly
black pipe this he lighted all with-
out reply to his factotums vehement
speech

  and superadded to which how-
aji pursued najib after vainly paus-
ing for answer superadded to which
je-hen-em yawns for him but he has
us as the folklore of your west world
land would say in the hollows of his
fingers wherefore what is to be
done 

  logan kirby withdrew the pipe from
his lips looked with contempt at the
upheaved yellow tobacco in its bowl
and gingerly sought to tamp it down
with his forefinger then he broke
silence

  najib he said hereabouts-some-
where between here and bagdad-or
maybe only between here and damas-
cus-that yarn was invented about the
magic carpet the rug that would

carry its owner anywhere on earth i
wish i had it id climb aboard for a
ruggy ride and id tell it to start off
and keep going till i told it to stop
then when i got just in front of
a tobacco store of my acquaintance a
block or so from times square id yell
whoa to the rug and hitch it to a
lamp-post while i went inside and
bought about -even and three-eighths
tons of a certain pipe mixture i know
of id-

  there is a plenitude of tobacco
here howaji interposed najib sore
puzzled both in cigarettes and for
also the nargile but i was speaking
with an urgency of-

  theres enough tobacco agreed
kirby but it makes me homesick
whenever i smoke it it reminds me of
the dear old days when i used to rake
autumn leaves and make bonfires of
them

  howaji spoke up najib with tear-
ful impatience i ask you if it is a
time and also a season for these sad
memories of home i request to know
is it we are in peril to lose all
there is perhaps a peril to the life as
well and you talk sweetly of tobacco

  no mildly corrected kirb i talk


the popular magazine

of the stuff in these cairene cigarettes
dont take the precious name of to-
bacco in vain by-

  but we are in a danger wailed

najib the welee-

  thats so assented kirby the
welee to be sure you were speaking
of him just now i remember calling
him pretty names werent you when
did he say hed be here

  at the hour before azim howaji

and i beseech-

  hm kirby consulted his watch
sun sets at about five-twenty that
would bring him here by twenty min-
utes past four or so ill have barely
time to write those two letters i must
send off when imbarak starts for jeru-
salem

  he turned toward his tent najib
interrupted him

  is it a time for being a scribe he
demanded in dismay when the welee
is prone to be in our mongst within
the hour

  there wont be time after hes gone
imbarak starts for jerusalem at seven
there also and likewise may not be
time to be alive after the welee is gone
howaji groaned najib if the how-
aji-

  kirby cut him short by strolling into
the tent and closing the flap behind
him but as the dingy tent flap shut
him off from view of najib and the
lounging soldiers and laborers outside
the americans flippancy of manner fell
away from him like an ill-fitting gar-
ment the lazily tolerant grin he had
worn for the natives benefit was wiped
from his lean face as a sponge wipes
chalk from a blackboard

  he crossed to a pile of luggage at
one end of the tent and fumbled with
the contents of two or three bags and
cases for a few moments neatly wrap-
ping in paper several articles and drop-
ping them into his khaki pockets then
he went to the deal table alongside the
center pole sat down on a camp chair

drew a scratch pad toward him and be-
gan to scribble he headed his letter

 cabell smelting companys antimony
mine somewhere in the land of moab
about seventy miles east of jerusaiem
syria

 after which he wrote

  dear uncle dick youre surprised to
hear from me of course especially since
your gushingly cordial invitation to me three
years back to go to the devil a few months
ago i accepted the invitation at least i did
the next best thing-i came to the land of
moab i came here as manager of the cabeli
peoples antimony venture

  i dont know why they picked me for the
job for they have fully a dozen better men
for it than i-except because i had spent my
first ten years of life in this god-forsaken
corner of the world when father was in
charge of the nablous mission and because
i knew the language and as much about the
syrian character as an outsider can reason-
ably hope to learn inside of two thousand
centuries but thats beside the point which
is-im here

  im not only here but i stand a fairly
bright chance of passing on to the hereafter
during the next couple of hours thats why
im bothering you with this letter youre
the only one of my kin who is still on top
of the earth and you were mighty good
to me-at least until i decided to keep on
in the school of mines instead of going into
the law school as you wanted me to hon-
estly i could have never have made a decent
lawyer father was a missionary and my
inherited conscience would forever have
been tangling me up never mind all that
though as i remember you and i threshed
it out pretty exhaustively three years ago

  youre the only relative i have and im
sentimental enough to want to shake hands
with you if this is really the end of the road
and to part with you as good friends im
going to give this letter to a muleteer who
is starting this evening on a provision trip
to jerusalem ill give it to him before the
row begins and tell him to keep out of the
way of the trouble and to set out as soon
as the road is clear-no matter what hap-
pens if nothing happens im going to get
this letter back from him and tear it up
for i dont want to extend the olive branch
to you unless theres a scrap of crape tied
to it because im pretty sure you dont
want it-undraped

so if this letter gets to you youll know
it is a genuine good-by and that im sorry
the miracle mx-up



i couldnt meet your ideas about a career
and that i wish we could have gotten on bet-
ter together you and i for i like you a lot

  heres the fix im in as i told you ive
been running this little antimony mine for
the cabell people its about the only one
between the hartz mountains and sarawak
and its a good property for all its so small
we sell our output right here in syria not
only for drug use but for kohl thats the
stuff the oriental beauties use to blacken
their eyelids my predecessor used to spring
a merry wheeze about working in a kohl
mine

  i was doing finely for a while and i got
a raise and the promise of another we
had a concession from the sultan wed
greased the basha-youd call him the
pasha but the arabs have no letter p
in their elphabet and they couldnt pro-
nounce it if they had wed also sprinkled
tribute money baksheesh is the local
word among the nastier of the near-by
bedouin tribes and we had-and have-
an imposing and quite useless honorary guard
of twelve turkish soldiers to protect us
when the soldiers arent eating theyre sleep-
ing when they arent doing either theyre
stealing

  my superintendent is a damascene named
najib except that he insists on talking to
me in a language which he mistakes for eng-
lish he is a treasure for two years long
ago he was with a show at coney island
and he cant seem to get it out of his system

  everything was going beautifully at the
mine until yesterday a welee native
faquir or holy man same as medicine
man among the indians happened along
at sight of our mine he nearly had a fit

  he explained to the fellaheen laborers and
the soldiers that we were digging in the exact
locality where fathma favorite wife of ali
the lion of allah was buried she is a
moslem saint and to disturb her bones he
assured my men would let loose upon the
desecrators a horde of djinni and afrits
and similar oriental hobgoblins who would
torture them to death and then burn their
souls

  dont laugh it isnt a joke or if it is
my natives dont know it to a man they
knocked off work the fellaheen and the
soldiers alike vowed they would not risk
je-hen-em by digging farther or allowing
any one else to

 i flashed the concession on them and
threatened them with the sultans wrrath
also the bashas no use the best i could
do was to keep them from running away at
once for the present they graciously re-

main and gobble full rations but they dont
do one lick of work and if we dont get
off our next shipment this week we lose the
biggest customer we have-a damascus firm
that takes seventy per cent of our output and
is flirting with a german syndicate which is
trying to undersell us and cant najib has
known the welee in other days he is posi-
tive our german competitors have bribed the
holy man to stir up this row its been done
before out here

 its a strike and failure to the mine
means failure to me this job was my big
chance and i had no intention of losing
it certainly not for an unwashed welee
so i tried to bribe the slimy old crook
nothing doing he has evidently been too
solidly fixed by the syndicate he wont even
talk terms with me

 he cursed me in a way that has set my
men to looking crosswise at me ever since
then once more he bade me leave this holy
ground that my infidel feet were defiling i
refused he cursed me again and went away
i thought i was rid of him

  i wasnt najib has found out that he is
rounding up a crowd of syrian fellaheen
from near-by villages and preaching a sort
of pocket-edition holy war to them lies
surely earning his syndicate pay najib
found out too that hes got a bunch of na-
tives worked up to the proper pitch of crazy
zeal and that he is going to lead them here
against us at azim sunset to-day

  as i understand it his playful plan is to
sic them onto me and then when they
have slain the infidel they are to enact one
more pious duty by filling up the mine so
that the late lamented fathmas mythical
bones may rest in peace again and inci-
dentally so that the syndicate may grabciur
trade

  pretty outlook isnt it do you wonder
im scratching off a word of good-by to the
only living person of my kin not that it
does any special good but id like you to
know what happened no one would know
otherwise for its a safe bet the natives
wont tell according to their report ill
have died from cholera or the plague or
snake bite as has many another white man
out here in these pink-brown mountains

  najibs the only one of the crew who has
too much sense to believe in every word of
the welees bugaboo story and hes scared
stiff so he isnt much use to me i try to
keep his pluck up and to impress the others
by not seeming to take the thing seriously
but its about the seriousest thing in the
world

  ive only one hope left as a matter of fact


the tpopulacr magazine

and that hope is so fantastic it wouldnt he
a hope at all anywhere except in syria-
where everything is fantastic its a fifty-
to-one shot but ive made my arrange-
ments to play it in the meantime-

  logan kirby laid down his fountain
pen for najib without any show of
ceremony came running into the tent

  howaji he almost screamed he
is coming-the welee is coming-up
the hill he comes and over five
trillion men at his heels all singing
din-din-din muhammed din
and making ready to kill in very saintly
joy a half hour it is before the time
the welee have averred that he will
come he-listen

  through the drowsy stillness of the
afternoon came a rumbling and mutter-
ing with a singsong cadence in it
kirby had heard the sound but once
before-in his early childhood when a
horde of moslem fanatics had tried to
storm his fathers- mission house at
nablous-but he would have recog-
nized it anywhere he glanced down
regretfully at the letter there was no
time to finish he tore it across then
made for the tent door the chatter-
ing and ague-stricken najib pattered
close behind him

  the camp was pitched in a little hol-
low a hundred yards in front of the
mine and facing a low hill that sloped
down into the valley behind from
beyond the crest of this hillock came
the droning chant of

 din-din muhammed din
for the faith for islam ever
swelling closer

  the laborers and the dozen soldiers
were already trotting up the hills
hither side to welcome the oncomers

  with a dash kirby was among his
erstwhile workers and guards pushing
past them and making at headlong
speed for the hillcrest in thirty sec-
onds he was at the summit the ashen-
faced najib toiling along prayerfully in
his wake

  at the crest kirby paused behind
him his men were pressing forward
in front moving in ragged formation
and carrying flintlock guns and horse
pistols and rusty curved sabers and
clubs a body of perhaps fifty men and
boys toiled up the steeper incline to-
ward him

  they swayed to and fro as they
climbed moving their bodies in time
to their eternal rumbling chant of din
-dili-din ten paces in front of
them minced the welee a horrible fig-
ure filthy white-bearded draped in a
cloud of yellowish rags

  at the crest was a little stone-encir-
cled spring the camps source of drink-
ing wtater kirby had forbidden the
sinking of a well nearer the mine on
the theory that men who must walk a
quarter mile every time they are thirsty
will not often waste the companys time
by being thirsty

  beside the rough coping of this
spring he paused the crowd in front
caught sight of him outlined against
the coppery sky above them and the
chant took on new fierceness intershot
writh words quite as unnecessary as un-
translatable nor were the workers
and soldiers who had swarmed up the
slope behind kirby overcordial in their
looks indeed one or two of them
had even caught up the din-din-
din singsong

  kirby lifted a hand for attention
and before dropping the hand to his
side put its palm across his mouth to
mask a yawn that had no existence
then as the hand fell he carelessly
let its fingers entwine themselves about
the butt of the pistol athis belt

  his eyes were on the welee and
the latter checked his uphill scramble
as he noted the contact of the long
brown fingers with the pistol butt he
came to a standstill a bare fifteen feet
from the spring his followers dis-
appointed at their leaders pause strag-
gled to a halt behind him
the miracle mix-up



  and thus for a brief instant the
whole party stood the mine men and
the welees followers in irregular semi-
circles opposite each other and at the
edges of the summit kirby beside the
spring facing the welee and with na-
jib crouching doglike at his feet

  the silence endured for the merest
fraction of a second then the welee
spoke his husk-dry voice whirring like
a locusts through the sudden hush

  feringhee foreigner he puffed
still winded by the run upon you
be such peace as allah the all-merciful
can grant unto an infidel

 and unto you o son of the
prophet and father of an hundred
sons unctuously replied kirby be
peace and prosperity and the blessings
of es-semme 

  it is said that in the orient two stray
dogs do not meet to fight without first
swapping compliments it is certain
that no two humans-be their meeting
never so urgent or hostile-fail to ob-
serve this world-old usage it costs
nothing-except time and time is the
one commodity wherein every oriental
is rich

  you have desecrated the shrine of a
saint pursued the welee courtesy be-
ing sated and i am come hither to

stop-

  so you said yesterday returned
kirby with real urbanity but you
were mistaken i am glad you are here
so that i may tell you so

  he spoke very quietly yet making
sure that his voice should carry to the
utmost bounds of two semilunes of lis-
teners  forestalling an answer he
went on

  o holy and heaven-descended we-
lee you were right-truth flowed as
sparkling and clear as the abana itself
from your reverend lips-when you
told me our mine was digged at the
spot where sleep the ashes of immortal
and glorified fathma-on whom be the
smile of the most high i know that

now past all peradventure though i
was fool enough yesterday to doubt
yet when you say i desecrate her shrine
you err that too has been revealed
to me

  his voice had gradually taken on the
droning intonation and his eyes the
glassily exalted look of the true east-
ern devotee his body swayed as he
spoke the crouching najib peered up
at him in amaze

  the others who had begun edging
and milling slowly forward came again
to a standstill they recognized the
signs and instinctively did them rev-
erence

  even as the busiest street in damas-
cus or jerusalem will respectfully sus-
pend traffic while a ragged mystic pro-
ceeds to have an epileptic fit or a reve-
lation or a vision in the center of the
thoroughfare-even as the war-crazed
dervish hosts slackened their mad on-
rush to a dead stop when their khalifa
was stricken by a heavenly trance on
the march to omdurman so now at
the time-honored symptoms of such a
supernatural visitation-even in an in-
fidel-the fanatics paused to look

  the primal check was but momen-
tarily and kirby realized this so he
wasted no time before making use of
it he swung his hands aloft his eyes
glaring heavenward his body swaying
convulsively white foam appeared
upon his parted lips his jaws moved
awkwardly as if he were chewing as
indeed he was the bit of shaving soap
he had put into his mouth as he stifled
the nonexistent yawn was lathering
more slowly than he could have
wished

  but the sight of the foam capped the
impression of the staring qyes and the
chanting voice and the swaying form
there could be no possible doubt that
this feringhee infidel was in the throes
of inspiration from fleaven the vil-
lagers the soldiers the laborers gazed
upon him with the awed delight that
the popular magazine



eastern onlookers ever glean from
such attacks even the welee looked
at him irresolute the fanatic fire eb-
bing a little from his withered and un-
washed face

  kirby through the tenseness of the
moment recalled how his missionary
father had given him no less than three
sound spankings in childhood for mim-
icking these devotee ecstasies it had
been the lonely boys favorite game at
the nablous mission house

  his voice scaling upward almost to
a falsetto and his language taking on a
formality worthy of bible days he in-
toned 

  fathma the glorified-fathma the
loved spouse of ali the lion of allah
-fathma appeared to me this day at
the still hour before dawn in a vision
she appeared to me and she spake

o	welee wouldst hear her words
from these poor lips of mine that are
unfit to breathe them they are a mes-
sage for thee

  a message snorted the scandalized
welee a message to w-through
the lips of an infidel

  she said thou wouldst not believe
wailed the swaying kirby she said
thou wouldst not because i am an in-
fidel and she bade me remind thee
that the prophet-on whom be forever
the peace of es semme-she bade me
remind thee that the prophet himself
in his hour of need at el-mecca
deigned to send an infidel greek to
omar with his call for help also that
the blessed koran saith-

  the lather strangled him and he
gulped he was glad of the interrup-
tion for he could not remember for
the life of him just what the blessed
koran had said on the subject of using
infidels as instruments for grace the
texts exact wording had slipped his
tumult-stirred mind

  but with his audience the gulp and
its accompanying shudder readily
passed muster as a spiritual spasm

the natives began to look impressed
the welee still glowered angrily
doubtful but the crowd was visibly-
and audibly-interested mastering
the strangulation kirby went on with
his chant

  thus spake the glorified spouse of
ali in my vision lo i have chosen
thee as my mouthpiece that all may
know the power of allah and his serv-
ants to speak to mankind even through
the lips of an infidel pariah wilt hear
me o welee or shall i hold my
peace 

  the welee made as though to speak
in sharp negation but an eager murmur
of assent from the two half circles of
hearers drowned his reply and kirby
hurried on

  this is the message o my brothers
as the vision of fathma the wonderful
spake it to me at the hour of false
dawn standing at my couch foot en-
wrapped in glory and with the face
of the sun and-and the stars in her
crown were seven  he ended lamely
drawing on rossetti for inspiration
bracing his taut nerves he repeated
this is the message my mortal
ashes have been transmuted by a mir-
acle of the most high into the silvery-
white dust of the mineral ye seek here
and it is my will that ye continue to
seek it so that men shall distribute it
throughout the earth and that my dust
may serve to blend with potions that
restore health to the stricken and to
darken and make lovely for their lords
the eyes of women and to weld rare
metals into strength and beauty con-
tinue thy task o infidel thou and the
believers who toil for thee thus may
the power of fathma forever reach out
beyond the grave it is my will 
kirby threw out his arms and fairly
shrieked the last words through his
foaming lips and to himself he was
groaning

  good lord a six-year-old kid
wouldnt be taken in by such piffle
the miracle mix-up



  a murmur of assent and dissent and
of argument was running through the
crowd the welee lurched forward in
a furious gust of rage shouting

 he lies he blasphemes he

would trick you  i say it-i the-

  aiwa yes intoned kirby as
if verifying something he had wholly
expected it is thus she told me thou
wouldst speak thy holy zeal for once
overcoming thine heaven-inspired
brain and she bade me prove by deeds
what thou wouldst not believe from my
words she bade me give thee a sign
yea two signs if need be though
for thine own sake o welee she bade
me seek to persuade thee by the first
and simpler sign

  a sign repeated the welee in
angry disbelief

  a sign  flew the muttered echo
through the crowd

  you repeat all of you the very
words i spake to her responded
kirby when she bade me give a
sign i said o mother of a million
believers how may  give a sign that
thine exalted servant the welee shall
believe for lo i am but an ignorant
feringhee who hath not wit to work
miracles and she replied to me be
of good cheer for it is not thou but
 working through thee who shall
make these miracles come to pass and
then she told me those things which
i should do

  by this time the crowd was as tense
with anticipated thrills as a sunday-
school class at its first circus for mir-
acles are things not seen every day
even in syria and there was every
prospect of at least one such manifesta-
tion perhaps of two the welee noted
the change in his followers mental at-
titude and he strove hotly to counter-
act it

  it is a trick he reiterated a
windy promise whereby he seeks to
fool you to none but the holy is it
granted to perform miracles behold 

  he drew his gnarled body to its full
height and opened wide his toothless
mouth from between his jaws gushed
a swirl of red flame

  allah sa-id nabi sa-id shrieked
the wondering syrians

  the welee glared triumphantly at
kirby-who had seen the fire-belching
trick a half hundred times from the
faquir booths of bagdad to the circus
side shows of pompton new jersey

 taking quick advantage of the
crowds stark amaze the welee drew
a curved knife from his belt and in
sight of them all drove it hilt deep into
his own emaciated chest when he re-
moved his fingers from around the han-
dle there was no sign of knife hilt
knife blade nor wound

  allah sa-id gasped the onlookers
again many of them falling face down-
ward on the earth and moaning forth
koran texts and prayers

  it is well broke in kirby with
difficulty steadying his voice again into
the singsong it is well none
doubted the holiness of the welee nor
his heaven-sent power to do things
which are impossible to mere mortals
such as we the spouse of ali fore-
told that he would do so she told me
he would spout forth flame and would
drive a knife to his heart she bade
me say it is she-under the will of
allah-who hath given him such
power

  the welee eyed his opponent with a
new look-a look in which rage was
now mingled with something very like
bewilderment

  it is known reiterated kirby it
is known to all folk that allah endows
his saints upon earth with miraculous
powers but it is also known to all
folk that allah doth not waste such
power upon the feringhee therefore
when i perform miracles before you
will it not be proof that i am but the
unworthy and helpless instrument in


the popular magazine

the hands of allah-through his be-
loved handmaiden fathma 

  again the welees hesitant denial
was drowned in an eagerly assenting
chorus of aiwa the crowd packed
and jostled in its crass excitement
here forsooth was more than a mir-
acle it was to be a duel of miracles
a sight to remember forever and to
relate to ones ophthalmic grandsons

  for a moment kirby stood move-
less facing his foe waiting to let the
impression sink in and to sharpen by
delay the nerves and the credulity of
his audience

  somewhere hereabouts thirty centu-
ries agone elijah and the priests of
baal had held their miracle contest
kirby remembered the sacred tale and
he smiled to himself at the idea of en-
acting the same scene under twentieth-
century skies but syrian skies he re-
flected are not twentieth-century skies
they are still the skies that looked
down upon the childhood of the world
and at the thought he took heart

  the first sign he droned body
asway and mouth afoam the first sign
she bade me give you was this

  he drew from the breast of his coat
a half dozen flat little paper parcels
every man among the miners and the
soldiers was familiar with the sight of
tke packages they were used for
holding ore samples in such packets
the men had again and again seen
kirby wrap the silvery-white specimens
of pulverized antimony

  these intoned the american wav-
ing the handful of papers at the welee
are pinches of the dust and the crushed
metal that i dig from the shrine of
the blessed fathma thine own breth-
ren will bear me out in this an hun-
dred times they have beheld me fill the
paper squares with such dust many
of them have filled the papers for me
is it not so

  aiwa assented the laborers zest-
fully nervous to see the miracle begin

  carelessly taking one paper from the
handful kirby thrust the rest back into
his pocket opening the paper he held
he displayed a teaspoonful of the whit-
ish powder

  this is the sign he droned the
powder here is but the powder we gain
from crushing the mineral yonder as all
of my men will attest brothers ye
have oft and again washed this pow-
der for me to cleanse it from earth
stains bear my witness hath the water
changed it in any way

  lla no negatived the work-
ers in ragged chorus growing more
and more impatient

 good approved kirby thus
spake fathma the blessed among
women sprinkle water upon this dust
of mine before the eyes of my serv-
ant the holy welee and give him
also of the dust that he too may sprin-
kle it with water if the dust he sprin-
kleth doth not change and if the dust
thou sprinklest doth become a cloud of
snow he shall know that thou art my
messenger and he shall obey my will
and all my people shall obey my will
and shall hinder thy labors no more
lest in my wrath i prevail upon allah
to send such snow throughout the
land to blast the pastures even as snow
has ever blasted the summit of her-
mon

  it was a dire threat to folk in a
country where prosperity depends on
pasturage scarce a man there but had
at some time been so inquisitive as to
climb mount hermons slopes to stare
at the wet soggy snow that plastered
the mountains crest after each lowland
rainfall scarce a man but remembered
the barren deadness of the earth on
hermons summit the threat was
pregnant

  it is a lie sputtered the welee
the blessed fathma-

  then prove it a lie ordered kirby
taking another of the papers from his
pocket and literally thrusting it into the
the miracle mix-uv



welees clawlike hand here is
water tapping a partly full earthen
ghoola that stood on the coping of the
spring i call on thee-in the name
of the glorified fathma-to do her bid-
ding

  the welee dropped the paper to the
earth where one end of the packet
opening the silvery powder spilled on
the dusty ground kirby had picked
up the ghoola and was pressing it upon
his foe the natives had clustered
close around breathless goggle-eyed
the welee pushed back the ghoola

  i will not he raged it is a lie
it-

  blasphemy reproved kirby i
have no means to make thee obey the
visions mandate o welee he added
yet  a mere infidel respect her too
profoundly to disobey see

  he shook upon a flat rock the pow-
der contents of his own packet then
dashed a spoonful of water on it
smoothing and manipulating the wet
powder with one hand he held aloft
the other in supplication his eyes roll-
ing heavenward as he chanted

  o fathma favored of allah spouse
of ali if i lie or if i call on thee in
vain smite me with fearful death or
let these thy servants slay me if i am
in truth thy messenger show forth thy
miracle according to thy word and let
this dust of thy lovely body turn to the
snows of-

  he got no farther his audience had
broken into a cry that swelled to a
roar wonder veneration fear-all
were blended in that spontaneous out-
burst

  kirby glanced downward to the
wrist his hand that manipulated the
wet powder was engulfed in a snowy
substance that glittered white in the
sunset

  allah quavered the awed crowd
allah hu akbar

  to all intents and purposes the pow-
der had in a few seconds become trans-

formed into a little snowdrift of thirty
times its original bulk at least to men
who have seen no more of such phe-
nomena than has the average syrian
it was indubitable and flawless snow

  miracle miracle groaned the
crowd the spouse of ali hath spo-
ken-and through a feringhee it is
as he said

  it is a lie a trick stormed the
welee

  but for once no one heeded him a
miracle is a miracle whoever performs
it and a miracle had been performed
the miners knew well that a pinch of
antimony powder does not change to
a double handful of snow through
washing the other fellaheen knew
nothing of antimony nor of chemistry
but they knew snow-the soggy wet
sticky snow of syrian mountaintops
and seeing they believed

  again kirby caught up the ghoola
he shoved it roughly into the welees
grasp then stepped back for the very
briefest instant the welee mechanically
held the vessel then in scorn he let it
drop it fell on soft earth and did not
break but a splash of water flew from
it as it struck ground and spattered
some of the powder that had been
strewn from the paper the welee had
dropped

   now cried kirby taking swift ad-
vantage of the accident thou also
hast sprinkled the white dust with
water-though against thy will-even
as fathma the blessed foretold to me
thou shouldst and her prophecy shall
come true for the dust does not
change into snow

  and then and there the badly rattled
welee made the one and only blunder
of his snaky career nettled at his
followers wavering allegiance he
dropped on one knee and as he had
seen kirby do he began to manipulate
the wet antimony and it remained
wet antimony


the cpocpulacr magazine

  a murmur rose from the little
throng

  have i lied o my brothers de-
manded kirby as the discomfited welee
scrambled to his feet fiercely chagrined
at his own blunder have i lied
does or does not the glorified spouse
of ali speak through me her unworthy
mouthpiece  are ye  content  may i
carry out the wishes of the blessed one
and continue to dig in yonder mine 
aiwa burst from fifty throats
the blessed one hath spoken

  it-it is false mumbled the welee
more and more stricken at his devotees
defection it is a trick

  but the miners knew better they
knew the ordinarily harmless action of
water upon antimony the fellaheen
too had witnessed the miracle of the
snow making and they were convinced
sure of his backing kirby wheeled
once more upon the welee

  a trick he echoed a trick
it is sacrilege to say so must i make
the second-the decisive-test

  akva aiwa babbled the crowd
crazy to behold another miracle

  it is well decreed kirby taking
forth the handful of the specimen par-
cels once more the blessed fathma
bade me as a final sign to devour two
of these packets of her dust and to bid
her unbelieving servant the welee also
to devour two if i be speaking in
her name no harm shall befall me if
he be right and i be wrong no harm
shall befall him but if either of us be
wrong in what we have told you con-
cerning her will as to the digging of
her dust then she will at once let loose
an afrit to afflict the liar in such way as
shall show all men that he is false
behold i do her will

  choosing two of the packets as at
random he tossed the contents into
his mouth and swallowed them by the
aid of a swig of water from the fallen
ghoola

  now he commanded thrusting

two more of the powders upon the
welee

  i will not vowed the welee in a
last burst of wrath it is fraud how
know i the dust is not poisoned
thou hast seen me devour it said
kirby it has oft and again fallen
on the lips and tongues of these my
workers and no harm has befallen them
take these two packets

  i will not i-

  a general muttering-decidedly ugly
in trend-stopped the welees hot re-
fusal his prestige was very much at
stake with a snarl like a cross cats
he snatched the proffered paper recep-
tacles shook their powders on his
tongue and gulped them down they
stuck midway he coughed and took
a swallow of water

  o fathma breathed kirby in
pious ecstasy and in almost dizzy re-
lief it is done

  it was done there could be no
doubt of that after a few seconds
of breathless silence wherein the eyes
of the close-packed and breath-held
throng devoured him the welees ex-
pression of lofty contempt changed all
at once to a look of trouble the crowd
cried out in sheer astonishment

  from trouble the wrelees aspect
merged into agony his mouth flew
wide open emitting marvelous sounds
that were a blend of dog howls and
the noise made by fifty exhausted si-
phons

  the welees clawr hands gripped the
welees sunken waist the welees
thin legs carried the welees thinner
body high into the air in a series of
frantic leaps whose nimbleness was as-
tounding in one so old and weak

  maschallah fathma el sitt odhi
el afrit chorused the onlookers jos-
tling and shuffling in fanatic fervor

  one big fellah cast down his antique
musket and fell at kirbys feet crying
adoringly
the mniacle mix-up



  saadat el basha rasoul allah
great master apostle of allah

  others followed his example ec-
static miners ran to the american
kneeling and seeking to kiss his hands
and his dusty boots

  meantime the welee was doing a
dervish contortion dance whose splen-
did abandon would have won him a
fortune on any stage and he accom-
panied each flying step with ear-tor-
turing screeches and with that nameless
vocalization as of a half hundred emp-
tying siphons

   at last worn out writhing in agony
moaning and still siphoning he rolled
helpless at kirbys feet

  the last of the rioters emeritus had
drifted out of sight down the wady
the last miner had rushed back to
work with tireless religious zeal
kirby weak with reaction longed for
some one-any one-with whom to talk
over his victory so he summoned to
his tent the worshiping najib who had
been frisking adoringly about him with
the grace and glee of a drunken bear
cub

  in storybooks najib observed
kirby the gallant young hero over-
awes the low-browed savages by some
such good old device as false teeth or
a wooden leg or a solar eclipse or a
neat conjuring trick but i dont know
eclipse dates and im shy on parlor
stunts and ive still got at least two
fairly solid legs and most of mv origi-
nal teeth-

  praise unto the most high for spar-
ing these blessings unto you o how- -
aji interposed najib blissfully in
english and may your fathers forty
lesser wives pay homage to your re-

spectable mother for that she have con-
descended to bear so grand a person as
you blest likewise and also be thy

paternal-

  so went on kirby unheeding the
rainfall of adulation t had to do
what i could with what i had i never
dreamed there could be so much beauti-
ful snowy lather in one spoonful of

shaving powder but-

  but put in najib perplexed the
powder you gave him to sprinkle it
pasted only and it neglected to fuzz

itself like-

  it was a perfectly good antimony
sample so were the two powders i
swallowed i hope antimony isnt bad

for the-

  and the powder he ate by the
grace of the blessed fathma-on whom
be-

  those just happened to be seidlitz
powders-the blue and the white the
sort i gave you when you were sick
last month but this time i had put the

blue one in a white paper and-

 but howaji babbled najib
they did not arouse hell fight within
me oh of an assuredly the glorified

fathma hath-

  you mixed the two powders before
you swallowed them the welee swal-
lowed them before he mixed them
thats all the difference just the
trifling difference between a glass of
soda water and a volcano you see
i-

  i see howaji murmured najib in
solemn veneration and i see that
the american bible text is brought to
pass one mans meat is better than
two in the bush and-the way of the

by way of introduction

on a certain day late in may of
last year mr howard allen
arrived in the little town of
arlington on a visit to his
married sister mrs wilton gardner
allen was in the diplomatic service
and he had been abroad continuously
for over five years filling minor posts
in bulgaria russia and spain it was
generally understood that his present
vacation was preliminary toan advan-
tageous advance he had attracted the
favorable attention of his chiefs at
washington through his prompt accept-
ance of responsibility on one or two
critical occasions and still more by
a savoir-faire and a diplomatic reserve
which have not always characterized
american representatives abroad

  arlington was a typical american
town not too big for friendliness not
too small for mystery the state cap-
ital brookfield some twenty-five miles
farther down the main railroad line
had drawn away big business leav-
ing arlington to the green trees and
inclosed gardens of its villagehood it
was allens home town but his absence

at school and college at washington
and abroad had kept him a stranger
for the last fifteen years now as he
walked again through its elm-shaded
streets and saw the tulips blooming in
prim propriety under the old-fashioned
bay windows it seemed to him an ideal
place for taking a rest-cure vacation
surely nothing ever had happened ever
could or would happen in so peaceful
a place which proves that whatever
mr allans other qualifications may
have been he did not possess the power
of reading the future

  his appearance in arlington was of
sufficient local importance at any rate
to be chronicled in the social column of
the daily journal mrs wilton gard-
ner had herself telephoned the item to
the society editor adroitly implying her
brothers various honors and dignities
and when she saw it all in print she
read the item with a satisfaction she
did not always find in browning al-
though she was a clubwoman and re-
puted intellectual she had plans for
that young brother of hers matri-
monial plans of course for a year
she had been impatiently awaiting his
the terrace inn tcragecdy



return in order to set her plans to
work she had intended to save that
interesting society item in the journal
but when she looked for the paper she
couldnt find it

  the reason was that her young sis-
ter-in-law antonia gardner who lived
with her and wilton had carried the
paper to her own room she clipped
the important item herself and she
slipped it into a very secret hiding place
in her writing desk where jessie would
never think of looking even if she did
come hunting for a postage stamp but
for that matter nothing would have
suited jessies plans better than this shy
interest on antonias part

  old thaddeus rantoul read the item
too-shaggy old thaddeus rantoul
harassed and beset by evil fortune
who had fled from arlington to escape
interviewers and dug himself in like
a badger at his country house in
breckenridge and as he read the
nervous scowl between his gray old
eyebrows softened and he muttered
half aloud good boy howie if
anybody can do anything for the old
man you can i wonder-i could trust
you if i could trust anybody-even to
see gordon but gordon is a snake

  gordon was not a snake he was
a state senator and entitled to be ad-
dressed as honorable rantoul didnt
think he had a right to the title but
rantoul was prejudiced and he was
not of a judicial temperament at any
time gordon may have read the item
about howard allen for he made a
point of skimming the state papers
pretty carefully but if he did it made
no impression upon him at the time
he was in attendance at the state legis-
lature which was drawing toward the
close of an extra session at the state
capitol and he was very busy he had
to live up to his reputation as a re-
former as well as to his title and be-
yond that there was a political future
which was not to be neglected in-

deed it is quite probable that he paid
no attention whatsoever to howard
allens visist to mrs wilton gardner

  it was mrs gardners name that
caught the eye of madeline hunt as
she sat alone in her room in the ter-
race inn that evening studying in print
the society doings of arlington folk
everybody knows that to read a menu
card does a hungry man little good
but mrs hunt read on and on with a
dont care look on her handsome
face then she turned back to the
gardner item i suppose she will be
more stuck up than ever the peacock
were the words that went through her
brain cells though she didnt speak
them aloud of course mrs gardner
was no more a peacock than senator
gordon was a snake as has been said
she was an intellectual woman also
she was very kindly and much occu-
pied with good works at home and in
the city but she was slightly absent-
minded she had been casually intro-
duced to mrs hunt at a civic im-
provement luncheon where all the
world had come together to listen to
an imported speaker and then she had
quite forgotten both the name and the
woman the next minute of course
mrs hunt should have been reason-
able and given mrs gardner the ben-
efit of the doubt when the latter passed
her without recognition but a six
months bride who is a stranger in a
strange city and who regrettably can
offer no social indorsements whatso-
ever is not so apt to be reasonable as
to be lonely and resentful she had
not realized before coming to arling-
ton that social indorsements served
any special purpose in the world she
had expected to be accepted at her face
value-which was distinctly above par
after six months at the terrace inn
she was still isolated not shunned
exactly but-isolated

  she read the item again and her first
bitterness melted into a sort of wist-


the popular magazine

fulness that was more becoming gee
she can invite her brother to come and
visit her she thought to herself me
im more scared that sylvan should
find out where i am than anything
else and that shows another con-
sequence of a too-thoroughgoing dis-
dain of social indorsements

  the city editor of the arlington
noon saw the allen item in the social
column of the rival paper cut it out -
with his pocket scissors drew a blue-
pencil circle about it wrote miss el-
lerson-interview in the circle and
tossed it into his pick-up basket from
which a boy took it in due course of
time to miss ellersons desk

  miss clio ellersons specialty for the
paper which availed itself of her serv-
ices was interviews with persons of im-
portance in their day her success was
largely due to the fact that she was
so much more human than professional
this was wholly against her wish and
intent for her ideal was to be per-
fectly professional-strictly and im-
personally and splendidly professional
she had a quite romantic loyalty for
her paper and a sense of responsibility
to the great american public which
was amusing or pathetic according to
your view of the noble activities of
the press perhaps both her ideal and
her happy failure to meet it personally
were due to the fact that her journal-
istic experience could as yet be meas-
ured in months

  it happened that at the moment when
the rounds boy brought the clipping to
her desk evan baring was lounging
against the end of it in an attitude
suggestive of unlimited leisure evan
baring was a privileged person many
privileges were granted to him and
the rest he took he had been a re-
porter on the noon when clio eller-
son first went there and his many
kindly helps to her ignorance when she
was a novice had established a friend-
ship which had survived his resigna-

tion from the staff and the vicissitudes
of fortune that had followed for
baring had been bitten by the sher-
lock holmes bee he was possessed
by the ambition to establish himself as
a private detective he cultivated as
extensive an acquaintance with the
criminal world as the somewhat lim-
ited resources of arlington permitted
and kept up unofficial relations with
the police department which had for-
merly been covered by his run he
was a year younger than miss eller-
son so she called him by his first name
and treated him generally as though he
were about fifteen he called her
miss ellerson with respectful cere-
mony and looked up to her as a per-
son of very superior attainments
though he knew more about the world
-not to mention the flesh and the devil
-in any minute than she had learned
in all of her twenty-three years

  do you mean to say miss eller-
son that you dont know why the noon
is ragging old thad rantoul he was
demanding at the moment

  i dont know that it is ragging
him she protested

  you bet it is-meanest kind of a
way not only in the serious edi-
torials but in the news stuff-twisting
a word here and there to create an at-
mosphere you just watch

  but if rantouls road has really for-
feited the conditions of the franchise
its to the public interest that the facts
should be known

  its to senator gordons interest to
make a grand-stand play and the noon
is playing party politics thats all

  here the boy dropped on miss el-
lersons desk the clipping announcing
to the world that mr howard allen
was making an extended visit to his
sister mrs wilton gardner and evan
baring quite naturally picked it up and
read it first

-	what you going to interview this
guy about he asked
the trracb inn tcrgecdy



  miss ellerson took the slip from
him and read it then instead of an-
swering she made rather an odd re-
mark

  i wonder how it feels to kill a man
she said

  baring straightened up into alert at-
tention

  dont do it miss ellerson what-
ever he has done dont you get your-
self in wrong believe me miss eller-
son its no cinch to have the police
against you theyre a low set and
they havent any feelings no matter
how high-toned a murder may be just
in itself you understand they are so
used to associating with real criminals
that they dont know how to discrimi-
nate what have you got against this
guy anyway not that its any of my
business if you dont want to tell
oh evan evan laughed miss
ellerson your sleuths imagination
jumped in the wrong direction that
time i have no intention of becoming
a murderess even of the highest tone
i was just thinking of this mr allen
and how he shot three men hand run-
ning a few years ago

 gosh you dont mean it how
was that

  it was during a riot in constanti-
nople a mob that had set out to clean
out all foreigners started for the amer-
ican hospital mr allen who was an
attache of the american legation at st
petersburg happened to be in the city
and on the spot he stood before the
door of the hospital and said he would
shoot any man that mounted the steps
they came on and he shot-three
times and he killed three men just
killed them dead without giving them
time to think or explain or repent or
anything

  did the mob stop baring asked
eagerly

  i believe so if they hadnt i sup-
pose he would have kept on

ca

  gee but that was great you dont
lay that up against him surely

 miss ellerson was meditative i
just wondered how he felt about it
when he thought it over you see
these men were not criminals they
were fanatics possibly but as individ-
uals they may have been strictly moral
men with families dependent on them
and all that and he made himself
their judge and their executioner with-
out any authority it must take an
enormous lot of self-confidence to do a
thing like that and not have it worry
you afterward

  butv he stopped the mob and saved
the hospital protested baring and
you say he warned them not to come
on why stay awake over that-noth-
ing any man would be proud of it
thats one reason why it isnt worth
while giving the ballot to women
smiled miss ellerson we take our
responsibilities too seriousiy to kill a
man out of hand just because your
judgment runs against his judgment
taking a responsibility that is if it
is done with thought if it is done
just on impulse what is the difference
between him and any other murderer 
every man who kills another probably
feels that he has a good reason for
doing so if you let down the

bars-

  good land miss ellerson wouldnt
you shoot a mad dog

  yes

  wouldnt you have shot the leader
of that mob

  no i am not saying i should not
have had a right to possibly a duty to
shoot but i know i should not have
done it

  baring looked baffled he had al-
ways regarded miss ellerson as an ex-
ception to tier sex-wiser more rea-
sonable more intelligent about life
you could talk to her as you talk to
a man and here she was up in the
air like the rest of them


the cpocpuljlr magazine

  howard allen always was pretty
sure of himself she remarked remi-
niscently

  you know him

  i used to know him years ago when
he went to school here in arlington
i havent seen him for many years
gosh id like to know him-a man
like that im going to have a look
at him anyway

  miss ellerson looked up at him and
smiled good-by evan so sorry
you cant stay any longer just now
but of course i know you are busy
baring picked up his hat writh a grin
say miss ellerson maybe you think
that isnt just as cold-blooded as draw-
ing a gun on a fellow you use dif-
ferent weapons but you get rid of
anybody you dont want just the same
clio ellerson left alone picked up
the little slip and read it over then
she pulled her desk telephone toward
her and called up mr wilton gardners
residence

  is mr howard allen in

  no hes gone out answered a
sweet young voice miss ellerson won-
dered subconsciously who could be
speaking-certainly not mrs gardner
nor the maid

  can you tell me when he will be
in  she pursued following the accus-
tomed trail toward an interview

  no i really dont know he has
gone out to breckenridge to see mr
rantoul and he may likely stay there
for dinner can i give him any mes-
sage 

  no thank you ill call again said
miss ellerson and hung up the phone

  then she meditated a little on the
information given by the sweet young
voice so mr howard allen had the
entree to thaddeus rantouls house
where no reporter had succeeded in
penetrating mr rantoul was very
much in the public eye just then and
clio ellerson special writer for the

noon was not the only newspaper rep-
resentative who had tried to pierce the
defenses of that breckenridge bunga-
low to ask mr rantoul what action
he intended to take in regard to sen-
ator gordons bill-and had tried in
vain mr rantoul was never at
home but if mr allen was to be
there this afternoon the door could
hardly be shut in the face of another
caller arriving possibly a few minutes
later miss ellerson picked up her hat
and gloves and left the office with a
subtle smile on her small dark face

  in the street she paused to get a
copy of the news from a little newsboy
who smiled at her in cheerful anticipa-
tion

  hello abram hows your uncle
she asked kindly

  he sick yet smiled abram with
unabated cheerfulness

  miss ellerson smiled back and went
on and for all her kind heart she
never guessed that little abrams ready
smile masked a heart shaking with ter-
ror for his uncle was very sick yet
and sick people sometimes died and
if he should die the bottom would cer-
tainly drop out of little abrams world
there was nobody in that world now
but abram and his uncle and just
around it stood a ring of harpies called
kind neighbors who talked audibly
about the uncertainty of life and the
advantages of an orphan asylum for
little boys who had nobody to look after
them when little abrams mind was
not preoccupied he frequently read the
headlines of the papers he sold for he
was a sharp-witted youngster and not
without enterprise but he never pen-
etrated so far inside as the society col-
umn so it is fairly certain that though
he had distributed many copies of the
previous days issue announcing the
arrival of mr howrard allen in arling-
ton he was himself quite unaware of
that momentous fact

chapter i

  oh howard i wonder if you would
do me a great favor said antonia
one evening at dinner with a shy
glance across the table at her brother-
in-law once removed howard allen
in spite of her effective air of shy-
ness she really had very little doubt
as to the answer for antonia gardner
did not often ask favors in vain she
was so little so sweet so appealing
and the rose-leaf color came and went
in her cheeks so flutteringly that even
her own family considered it a privi-
lege to serve her and is it possible to
say more than that  and certainly
howard allen her sister-in-laws here-
tofore unknown brother had shown no
disposition during the week he had been
a guest in the house to depart from
the family tradition since the first
day it had been taken for granted that
his prime occupation was to carry out
antonias wishes his smile across the
table now answered before his words
ask what you will to the half of
my kingdom -

  ask quick tony while the askings
good adjured her brother wilton
from the foot of the table

  the half of his kingdoms no great
matter gibed allens sister from the
other end

  the half of my material kingdom
may not offer anything worthy of
antonias acceptance said allen
promptly but when it comes to my
wall and my willingness there is no
limit to the resources i place at her
disposal what is the favor ajito-
nia

  oh i wondered if you would mind
going over to boltons bluff with me
this evening if you have nothing else
to do i want to go and i dont quite
like to go alone in the evening i
dont know the streets very well and

it isnt exactly a nice part of town-

  you most certainly are not to go

there alone interrupted her brother
what under the sun do you want to
go to boltons bluff for anyway
on account of one of my newsboys
-abram makowsky antonia ex-
plained with a little embarrassment
even before her own family she hesi-
tated to refer to the private philanthro-
pies which blossomed under her fin-
gers-generous fingers which were for-
tunately filled with gold his uncle
is ill-abram told me a week ago-the
last time i went down to the newsboys
club and i said i would go out and
see him soon i ought to have gone
before this-abram expected me-but
other things kept coming up the
tremulous color came into her cheeks
again the other things of the past
week had mostly involved the enter-
tainment of one howard allen

  of course howard will be delighted
to go with you said mrs gardner
briskly she was a large and com-
petent woman and she had no idea
that her habit of deciding other peoples
affairs for them might sometimes be
unwelcome

  but much to her surprise and not
at all to the credit of his diplomatic
training allen looked distinctly em-
barrassed

  i am so sorry-this evening--an im-
portant engagement-i am really so

sorry-

  why howard cried mrs gard-
ner with sisterly reproach in her voice
what possible engagement can you
have that we dont know about of
course you can go

  allen did not answer her but turned
to antonia to-morrow evening or
any other time you know i shall be
happy to go with you

  it doesnt matter at all protested
antonia hastily i only meant if it
was perfectly convenient of course
maynt it be to-morrow evening-
if it is to be an evening call

  she shook her head with a depre-


the cpocpullcr magazine

eating smile we have theater seats
for to-morrow-but really it doesnt
matter i can go some afternoon i
only thought of the evening so as to
be sure to see abram-he is away in
the daytime but really it doesnt mat-
ter in the least about to-night

  so said antonia and yet it mattered
just this much that if they had gone
that evening to see abram makowskys
uncle who was ill this story of the
terrace inn tragedy would never have
been written so seemingly accidental
are the obstacles that change the cur-
rent of the stream of events 

  but the current of mrs gardners
curiosity was not so easily diverted

   what is your important engage-
ment howard she demanded

  but allen had had time to recover
his diplomatic inscrutability

  a matter of international politics
jessie dear he said gravely i re-
gret that i cannot say anything more
but if i should never return from this
evenings fateful errand remember
that my correspondence is to be de-
stroyed unread and you wilton are
to have my pearl studs

  thanks said gardner i suppose
in exchange for the provisional studs
-which jessie would claim for ear-
rings as soon as she was out of mourn-
ing-you would like a present and ac-
tual latchkey

  thoughtful as ever murmured
allen gratefully

  but i dont see why it is necessary
to be so mysterious about it persisted
mrs gardner we dont live in an
age of conspiracies and dark dungeons
i thought american diplomacy was all
open and aboveboard-what is it liz-
zie  for the waitress was hovering
at the dining-room door with some-
thing in her hands

  a special-delivery letter for mr
allen-the boy wants him to sign the
book she brought it to allen at the
table

  allen scribbled his name glanced at
the superscription on the envelope and
laid it face down beside his plate

  dont hesitate to read your letter
howard said mrs gardner blandly

  thanks jessie but it isnt neces-
sary by means of a sixth sense which
diplomats are supposed to cultivate i
know the contents of the letter by
merely glancing at the envelope some-
times of course if i am out of prac-
tice or if the handwriting is especially
difficult i have to hold it against my
forehead and close my eyes for a mo-
ment but not in this case

  of course your long-distance con-
versation with thaddeus rantoul this
afternoon had nothing to do with your
powers of divination gibed his sister

  allen lifted his eyebrows and then
smiled with a well-acted air of sur-
prise and tolerant amusement

  what made you think my conversa-
tion was with mr rantoul he asked

  i happened to answer the phone
and central said that breckenridge
wanted you then i held the line while
lizzie was trying to find you and i
heard some one-i thought it was mr
rantoul-say is that you h a 
of course i may have been mistaken
she added with suspicious meekness

  give it up howard laughed gard-
ner across the table i gave up try-
ing to throw dust in her eyes the first
year we were married besides it is
not a criminal offenge to hold a tele-
phone conversation with old thad ran-
toul you run a risk of having his
hoodoo settled on you though

  if settling on me would take it off
of him id run the risk cheerfully
said allen there was a flash in his
eye that gave emphasis to his words

  and be a fool for your pains said
gardner coolly its no joke having
to fight a hoodoo like rantouls

  really what do you mean  asked
antonia curiously you talk as
though you believed it
the terrace inn tragedy



  well it really is enough to make
any one superstitious the run of ill
luck that man has had said mrs
gardner first he met with an acci-
dent when he was a young man that
crippled him so that he has had to
walk with a cane ever since then his
bank failed-he was president and all
the property he had went into the
wreck then there was some mining
business that went smash and other
things too-everything he has touched
seemed to go wrong honestly how-
ard i wish you wouldnt have anything
to do with him

  the momentary pause that allen
made before answering was really de-
voted to keeping the edge of temper
out of his voice for his years of
diplomatic training had merely disci-
plined his naturally quick temper with-
out eradicating it and thaddeus ran-
toul was the great enthusiasm of his
life he gave to him something of the
devotion which a boy gives launcelot or
bayard the loyalty which a passionate
royalist pours out for his dethroned
king it was a romantic idealization
which went far beyond ordinary filial
affection though there was also some-
thing filial in it it was really the self-
forgetful devotion of the boy carried
over into manhood

  those facts are all true he said
now but they tell only half of the
story he rushed into the accident that
crippled him to save another mans life
-and he did it when his bank failed
he gave up every cent he owned to the
depositors more than that-jessie and
i lost practically our entire inheritance
in that bank failure antonia and mr
rantoul in effect adopted us and edu-
cated us from that time on

  i havent forgotten howard im
not ungrateful said mrs gardner
with a flush still-it was through his
fault that we were left penniless
fault or misfortune he took the
responsibility then in that mining

deal after giving years of time and
thought and planning to developing a
splendid property he lost the whole
thing through no fault of his own but
through some technical flaw in the title
that his lawyers should have discov-
ered in the beginning as usual he
had to stand the racket no matter who
was at fault

  he must have been born under an
unlucky star said antonia if you
are born under an unlucky star you
just cant help yourself you know
everything you touch turns to ashes
what is mr rantoul doing now

  allen did not answer but gardner
did there is a ghoulish gleam in
your eye tony you know you are
anxious to hear what further misfor-
tune is threatening the poor man

  well-just to make the story com-
plete

  im afraid you are going to be grat-
ified it looks as though rantoul were
in for a whole peck of trouble after
that mining-deal fiasco he took to rail-
roading he was made president of
the s  c road-an old road that
was started long ago when the state
was young and needed railroads and
was willing to give big concessions to
get them the s  c had been badly
managed for years and was hardly
earning expenses rantoul worked the
thing up made some connections with
other roads in the north and altogether
made the property valuable and now
after he has put in time and energy
and brains and is just on the point of
getting something back somebody has
discovered that the old road didnt live
up to the conditions of the franchise
i havent followed the matter in de-
tail but if the newspaper reports are
correct it means that the entire prop-
erty of the road would be wiped out
to satisfy the claims of the state

  and will it be

  well the matter is now before the
legislature senator gordon has been


the vovulatr magazine

particularly active about the investiga-
tion he is making political capital
out of it of course but there are a
lot of people who have a grudge to
satisfy against the old s  c and this
gives them a chance people in gen-
eral have an idea that railroads just
coin money and that if you can beat
a road in any way you are merely get-
ting even

  what sort of a man is gordon
asked allen thoughtfully

  ask tony said gardner with sus-
picious seriousness

  nonsense protested antonia lift-
ing startled and reproachful eyes to
her brother i never saw him more
than once in my life

  you made good use of that once
touykins

  but mrs gardner came to antonias
support dont be absurd wilton
you make tonia uncomfortable sen-
ator gordon was here once howard
at a large reception he may be a
wizard in politics but socially he is a
dumb driven beast and if tonia hadnt
taken pity on him and talked to him
i dont know what would have become
of him hes a farmer isnt he wil-
ton when he isnt legislating 

  yes he owns a large farm up near
daltonville but dont make the mis-
take of thinking there are hayseeds in
his hair

  i liked him said antonia shyly
he seemed so anxious to make him-
self pleasant

  that isnt exactly the reputation
that he has at large to answer your
question further howard he is a man
of the people a farmer as jessie says
but for all that one of the keenest
shrewdest hardest of practical politi-
cians

  honorable 

  nothing has ever come out to the
contrary

  allen looked up with a smile is
that just natural cynicism or do you

think that gordon-might have his
price

  they say that everybody has his
price

  allen lapsed into an abstracted
silence which lasted until dinner was
finished

  mrs gardner rose does your im-
portant engagement take you away im-
mediately howard or are we to have
the pleasure of your company in the
drawing-room first what is it liz-
zie 

  the maid at her elbow murmured an
inaudible message

  in the library good gracious why
didnt you let me know  howard
miss ellerson is here to interview you
-miss ellerson of the noon thats
what comes of being a celebrity

  but i dont want to be interviewed

  nonsense you arent enough of a
celebrity to take that pose its money
in your pocket to have your name in
the papers early and often so be
sweet to miss ellerson-shes as clever
as they make them and it will pay
you to be in her good graces come
on ill introduce you and she
slipped her hand in her brothers arm
and led him to the library where miss
ellerson of the noon had been asked
to wait

  whatever allen came to think of
clio ellerson in after days-and his
thoughts on the subject of that young
woman were many and various-it may
be said at once that this introduction
did not prepossess him in her favor
in the first place his sense of per-
sonal dignity was affronted by the
strenuous methods of american news-
papers furthermore he wanted just at
this time to keep out of the public eye
as much as possible for reasons con-
nected with that interview with ran-
toul which he had not discussed with
his family and even so faint a spot-
light as could be cast by the noon was
the terrce inn tragedy



annoying and finally he didnt care
for clever women like most young
men he considered that the womanly
woman was one made to love and be
loved-like antonia for example he
therefore bowed somewhat stiffly to the
young woman trimly tailor-made and
self-possessed to whom his sister pre-
sented him then he looked up and
met her eyes in which a start of sur-
prise melted into an amused smile

  so its you she said demurely

  so you are miss ellerson he re-
torted but there was no gleam of
amusement in his face

  mrs gardner looked from one to
the other in some perplexity i gather
that you have met before she said

  not met exactly said allen re-
covering his self-possession miss
ellerson stood by and watched me make
a most undignified entry through mr
rantouls kitchen window the other
day did you take me for a burglar
miss ellerson

  she laughed delightfully no i
took you for a rival and more suc-
cessful interviewer i had been unable
to effect an entrance myself-the door
was barred you cannot imagine how
i envied you when i saw you climbing
in through the window

  allen forced a smile but it took an
effort he was still young enough to
hate being laughed at above all things
on earth

  howard would probably rather be
taken for a burglar than a reporter
said mrs gardner with the large in-
difference to the delicacies of tact
which is frequently found in efficient
women he pretends to hate news-
paper publicity but if you make him
appear clever in your interview he will
like it do your best for him miss
ellerson she nodded smilingly and
left the room

  there was a hint of mischief behind
miss ellersons demure smile she

looked up at mr allen with guileless
earnestness

  what are your impressions of
america mr allen

  you dont really want me to answer
such a-such a question do you 
allen asked struggling to keep his an-
noyance out of his voice

  not unless you like as you say

it is a fool question--

  pardon me i didnt say that
perhaps you didnt but you think
so-vehemently however ill ask
something else can you tell me what
attitude mr rantoul is going to take
in regard to this legislative investiga-
tion 

  allens diplomatic mask was on in
an instant i beg pardon

  is he going to fight or defy it or
ignore it or come across

  i am so entirely ignorant regarding

the subject-

  miss ellerson waited but he seemed
to think the sentence completed

  ive tried and tried to see him she
said wistfully but he wont say a word
to me saturday when i saw you get
in through the window i was tempted
to follow but i thought perhaps id
better wait and interview you instead
it seemed possible that he might have
discussed the situation with you

  on ordinary occasions allens eyes
were recognizably blue but they seemed
to have turned blank and black as they
met hers

  and did it also seem possible that
i might repeat to you his remarks as-
suming that he made any

  in the newspaper business said
miss ellerson calmly we are not sup-
posed to recognize impossibilities even
when we see them we are expected
to get the story

  even if it is none of your-of the
publics business

  miss ellerson did not flush at his
words she looked at him with quiet


the cpocpuljlr magazine

 earnestness he had a swift percep-
 tion that now he saw her real spirit

   publicity is like sunshine mr allen
 -it is antiseptic evil things cannot
 live under its rays it may sometimes
 annoy our sensibilities but it can do
 no real harm and from that point of
 view there is no private business which
 is not in some degree the publics busi-
 ness certainly the public has a
 right to know the truth about the
 s  c road and about mr rantoufs
 methods and senator gordons motives
 nothing flourishes in the dark except
 -fungus

   then the newspapers do not merely
 furnish gossip in print he asked
 drawing her on to express herself in
 spite of himself he was interested-less
 in her views perhaps than in herself

    she shrugged her shoulders lightly
 they may think they are merely fur-
 nishing gossip and the readers may
 think they are merely reading gossip
 but-god works in a mysterious way
 his wonders to perform the bad man
 knows that this gossip might land him
 in prison business secrets are out
 of date mr allen and mysteries are
 always open to suspicion

   you will be justifying detective
 agencies next-and eavesdropping-
 and the opening of private letters
 his smiling mockery teased her

   i have great confidence in sunshine
 said miss ellerson simply you see
 mr allen a good deal of curiosity has
 developed in regard to this gordon in-
 vestigation of the s  c just because
 mr rantoul has been so persistently
 silent about his position it has been
 suggested that he has a trump up his
 sleeve which he is going to spring at
 the last moment it isnt like him
 you know just to lie down and give
 up

   no it certainly isnt

   thats why i have tried to get a
 chance to talk to him about it he
 wont see any one from the press

now-if i could give an authorized
statement from a personal friend of his
-one who had a confidential chat with
him no later than last saturday-it
would be read with great interest-and
would probably do his side of the case
no harm

  allen smiled but shook his head i
see your position miss ellerson as
you say you believe in sunshine but
you may have heard the proverb to the
effect that it is difficult to extract sun-
shine from cucumbers in this instance
i am a cucumber

  she smiled in answer and rose as
you will but it is only fair to warn
you that i am going to try to extract
it from gordon

  when  he looked startled

  she watched him curiously at the
first opportunely she said slowly and
noted the look of relief that uncon-
sciously relaxed his features so you
will not even give me your opinion of
america 

  may i give you instead my opinion
of american newspaper women 
some time-when your acquaint-
ance is more extended she said com-
posedly good evening mr allen
her manner was slightly but percepti-
bly defensive and allen realized un-
comfortably that his carelessly spoken
words might not have seemed to her
the compliment he had intended could
she possibly have supposed that he
meant to criticize her he escorted
her ceremoniously to the door but his
diplomatic calm was not a little ruffled

  it would have been more ruffled if
by any possibility of telepathy he could
have read miss ellersons thought as
she paused at the street corner not
that she was thinking about him mr
howard allen had gone completely out
of her mind but she was thinking in-
tently as she stood there-

  now what car line will take me
nearest to the terrace inn

  allen sought his sister who is
the terrace inn tragedy



miss ellerson jessie friend of
yours 

  why old judge ellersons daugh-
ter they used to live in our street
when we were children-surely you re-
member him

  oh of course i thought the name
was familiar i remember the girl too
-a wild little thing with hair flying in
the wind we ran a race once on the
playground and she beat me-i tripped
and fell and she went past me like a
flash that rankled some sort of a

classic name-

  clio

  of course why under the sun is
a nice girl like that doing reporting
well she had to earn her living
when the judge died what would you
have had her do you medieval man
marry 

  that wouldnt be difficult in her
case i fancy but anything rather
than reporting-horrid prying busi-
ness 

  did she try to pry into your af-
fairs asked mrs gardner surprised
and a little resentful

  oh no of course not he answered
hastily i was just speaking on gen-
eral principles

  clio is clever and i understand she
is doing very good work but i havent
seen much of her since her mother
died now come into the drawing-
room  antonia is going to sing you
will love her voice

  allens face brightened but it fell
again as he glanced hastily at his watch

  sorry but i cant wait some other
time i hope-and soon

  oh i forgot your mysterious en-
gagement when shall we see you
again 

  i cant say when ill be in but not
late its nothing but a business en-
gagement jessie so dont go making
a mystery about it mysteries are al-
ways open to suspicion-as some one
has said

  oh im not going to be horrid and
prying like a newspaper woman bless
you he shall have his little mysteries
if he wants them good-by dont get
into any trouble howie

  i wont he promised easily

  on the street corner he paused a
moment to look about

  now i wonder what car line will
take me nearest to the terrace inn
he cogitated

chapter ii

  allen may not have realized it but
part of his reluctance to have the
guesses of his family so much as touch
the edge of his errand that evening
arose from his distaste for the errand
itself he paused under a street lamp
to light a cigar and walked on slowly
reviewing the situation in his mind

  flis five years of absence in foreign
lands had brought him home with all
his sensibilities quivering with home
affection he was to make an extended
visit with his sister in arlington but
on the second day he had hurried off
to look up thaddeus rantoul who had
gone off to his summer home at near-by
breckenridge he was shocked to find
rantouls hair much whiter than he
remembered it and still more disturbed
to find that the accumulating troubles
which gardner had retold at the din-
ner table this evening had worn upon
the nerve of the old fighter he was
still leonine still magnificent as he had
been when he caught and held the de-
voted admiration of the boy howard
but he was no longer triumphant over
his evil destiny he was fretted
harassed resentful he had leaned
heavily upon allens sympathy retail-
ing the outrageous onslaughts of for-
tune with more vehemence than co-
herence allen had listened with keen
interest and answering indignation and
had asked if there was no way in which
he could be of service

  not unless you will sandbag sen-


the popular magazine

ator gordon rantoul answered with
a flash of his old manner

  would the investigation be dropped
if he were disposed of allen had
asked

  i think so i have strong friends
in the house and everybody knows
that even if the management of the
s  c was as crooked as a worm
fence in its early days its sins are
dead and should be decently buried
the road itself would have been dead
if it hadnt been for my work these
four years past i have made it worth
investigating and penalizing the devil
take him 

  has the situation been laid before
him 

  oh hes a reformer bless your
soul one of these reformers who go
around with a brass band and a press
agent but ill bet any balance that
may be left me after they have con-
fiscated the s  c that if somebody
investigated him they wouldnt have to
go very far to find something worth
looking into

  allen felt helpless he was aware
of his own ignorance in regard to a
hundred aspects of the situation which
might be vital but most keenly of all
he felt that this splendid old fighter
was caught in an exasperating snare
and that it was pitiful he urged his
own willingness to do anything within
the range of possibility and of his
powers and there the matter was left
but a few days later rantoul called
him up by phone and demanded his
immediate presence at breckenridge
im laid up with a broken leg he an-
nounced in tones of tragfc calm

  really demanded allen not from
any doubt of mr rantouls veracity
but merely as an expression of surprise

  well ive sprained my ankle if you
are so infernally particular about the
exact details but since i cant get
about it might as well be broken and
be damned to it gome on out ive

got to talk to you and i cant express
myself properly without running the
risk of having the company remove my
telephone you get the next car out
without fail and he rang off to save
argument

  this was on a saturday allen had
obeyed instructions and caught the next
suburban electric for breckenridge

  breckenridge was a summer colony
on the high banks of a lake some dozen
miles from arlington and here ran-
toul lived the simple life in his cot-
tage the ridge which was cared for
by a woman of the neighborhood who
came in by the day it was all right
when the tough old man was in his
usual form but if he was laid up with
a sprained ankle it would be tedious
enough allen reflected he should
have to insist that rantoul get a proper
nurse or that he return to his hotel
apartment in town where he could have
proper care

  the door of the screened porch
which formed nearly half of the house
was locked-contrary to custom as
allen shook it rantouls deep voice
boomed out from some interior

  that you howie

  yes im locked out

  climb in through the kitchen win-
dow and come out to the front porch
i cant get up to let you in

  allen followed directions though
with some inward protest to remove
a screen from a kitchen window and
climb in across a table covered with
pans and dishes is not particularly dif-
ficult for an athletic young man but
neither is it a particularly dignified pro-
cedure and allen was young enough
to have a lively sense of what was be-
coming to a man who might on occa-
sion be called upon to represent his
country to the world he managed
however to effect an entrance-and
then he saw outside a trim young
woman who had evidently been watch-
ing his efforts with wide-eyed interest
the terrace inn tragedy



  allen swore to himself as he dodged
out of range of her vision and went
in search of the front porch here he
found rantoul with a stiffly swathed
leg stretched out on a chair

  you dont encourage visitors was
allens greeting

  theres been a confounded woman
reporter here from the noon nothing
saved me but having the door locked
think of her nerve when i came out
here especially to get out of their reach
spies and tattlers that they are well
howie heres a pretty kettle of fish
he moved his foot to see how much
it would hurt and then swore pictur-
esquely at the pain

  have you had it properly looked
after allen asked

  oh thats all right theres a doc-
tor summering right next door but
the dickens of it is that i cant put
my foot to the floor for several days
no i should suppose not but you
cant stay alone

  oh heavens howie dont worry
me about unimportant things like that
thats the doctors business he is
going to bring some one out from
arlington to-night a wet nurse i
suppose thats why i had to see you
at once before the eavesdropper got
here see here howie you said the
other day you wanted to do something
to help me was that lip service or did
you mean it 

  i meant it of course

  how far would you go

  any distance

  rantoul smiled in content good
boy i knew i could bank on you i
knew you wouldnt quibble however
im not going to ask you to shoot gor-
don or do anything else that your
honor would not sanction-or perhaps
id better say my honor since i dont
know what delicate lines yours might
draw he stared at allen a minute as
though perplexed by a momentary
doubt

  allen was a little surprised but he
made no comment and rantoul spoke
again abruptly

  i want to send you as my repre-
sentative to gordon

  why most certainly-

  rantoul held up a checking finger
it isnt so simple as all that this is
an absolutely secret mission you must
mention it to no one now or at any
time in the future you must lie about
it if you are not clever enough to keep
from being pushed into a corner you
must not leave room for a guess or a
surmise

  it sounds very mysterious

  not mysterious but secret secret
as the devil so secret that you arent
going to know anything about the mat-
ter yourself

  then how can i act intelligently
you will follow orders i shall give
you a letter in a plain envelope sealed
which you will place in gordons hands
when he has read it he will indicate
whether he regards my proposition fa-
vorably or not if he does you will
give him a second letter which will
also be sealed in a plain envelope but
marked  for your guidance if his
position is unfavorable you will come
away and bring no  back to me
and then you will forget the whole
thing it happened while you were in
a trance

  it sounds fairly simple allen com-
mented

  rantoul groaned it would have
been simple enough if i hadnt got my-
self laid up like this i was coming
back from brookfield when i slipped

getting off the train-

  allen reflected that brookfield was
the capital where the legislature was
even now in session and drew his own
conclusions

  til telephone you when and where
to discharge your errand after i have
arranged the details dont come out
here again


the populzr magazine

  and the letters  asked allen

  those i shall send to you by regis-
tered mail with full directions

  so the matter had been left at that
time allen could hardly doubt in his
own mind that he had committed him-
self to assisting in some sort of bribery
or threat by which gordon was to be
influenced he did not like the idea
but neither did he like the idea of fail-
ing the old man who relied upon him
that alternative was not to be contem-
plated nor was any other course open
his opinion was not wanted his judg-
ment was not consulted he was sim-
ply asked to do something-one small
thing-for the man who had done much
for him and who stood alone facing a
narrowing circle of foes of course he
would do it

  but he liked it still less when a tele-
phone message from rantoul gave him
his final instructions he was to go
that evening to the terrace nn in
arlington and ask for j w mcgrath
he would be shown to mcgraths room
and he was to deliver the letter which
would be delivered to him by registered
mail that afternoon to the man whom
he would meet in the room

  is mcgrath himself  asked allen

  you couldnt tell them apart said
rantoul over the wire

  so there was secrecy on gordons
part as well allen felt that he was
getting into a coil but he asked no
further questions he had undertaken
to do rantoufs errand and the less he
knew about things beyond the immedi-
ate line of his engagement the better
probably common sense told him that
where so much secrecy was necessary
there was good reason for a profound
lack of curiosity on his part

  the registered packet which had been
delivered to him during dinner con-
tained the two letters from rantoul
one was a long envelope marked
no  he had placed both of them

in his coat pocket from which he had
removed everything else so that he
could get at them readily now as he
walked down the street smoking his
cigar a grim idea came into his mind
suppose he should be run over by an
automobile or shot up by a lurking
highwayman and those letters be
opened by the police to discover his
identity accidents did happen in this
world

  a street car took him to the neigh-
borhood of the terrace inn which he
had previously taken the precaution to
look up in the city directory the inn
lay in a midway region between the
business and the older residence part of
the town it was an attractive build-
ing in old english style obviously
catering more to permanent boarders
than to transients it took its name
from a green and graduated terrace
at the rear which ran down the block
to the street below on which were rail-
way tracks allen taking in the loca-
tion with interest and curiosity guessed
correctly that the inn might be easily
reached by passengers who alighted at
the cross street instead of going on to
the union station and who could
therefore readily make a visit to arling-
ton without forcing that fact upon the
attention of the public this way sta-
tion within the city limits was a sort
of back door to the town

  just in front of the terrace inn
which occupied a corner position in the
block there was a small triangular
park filled with shade trees and park
benches and dimly lit by a solitary
electric light allen noticed a young
woman seated on one of the benches
and he was sufficiently uncomfortable
about his errand to wish she were not
there to observe him he was not suffi-
ciently familiar with miss ellertons
silhouette to recognize her in that light

  the entrance to the inn opened upon
a wide hall not at all brilliantly lighted
on the left was a small office where
the tetrcrjlce inn tcrjgevy



a clerk was talking idly to a young man
who lounged against the cigar stand

  can you tell me if mr mcgrath
is in-j w mcgrath allen asked
making his tone as casual as possible

  ill see the clerk crossed over
to the other desk and examined a wall
register yes he is stopping here
send up your card

  no he is expecting me ill go up
the clerk touched a buzzer and a
boy in modest livery appeared from
some outer region

  take gentmun to no  the clerk
said severely and returned to his in-
terrupted conversation with the young
man who wore his hat on the back of
his head

 room no  was on the second
floor the door at which the boy
stopped looked exactly like the doors
to right and left of it except that it
stood slightly ajar when the boys
tap was not answered he pushed the
door open experimentally the room
was empty

  guess hes gone out said the boy
cheerfully dye wantta wait

  as allen had come there for the
express purpose of seeing mcgrath he
had no intention of taking any chances
the door ajar suggested that the occu-
pant of the room could not be far away

  ill wait he said briefly and
stepped inside the door automatically
closed behind him the boys dimin-
ishing whistle marked his departure

  allen glanced about the room it
was the ordinary impersonal room pro-
vided for transients-furnished with a
bed a dresser table and two chairs
a mans straw hat on the dresser and
the rumpled towels in the adjoining
bathroom the door to which stood open
were the only indications that the room
had been recently occupied allen
glanced at his watch his appointment
had been for nine it still lacked ten
minutes of the hour he took a chair
and settled himself to wait

  some time had elapsed-more than
ten minutes-when allen was roused
out of the semireverie into which he
had fallen by the sound of voices in
the hall outside the door the voices
were not loud but they were clearly
angry with the bristling of interest
with which man recognizes a fight
allen sat up alertly and listened he
could distinguish nothing except that
two men were talking at the same time
then there was the sound of a scuffle
immediately followed by two shots
from a revolver forgetting all reason
for keeping himself inconspicuous
allen sprang for the door he could
not open it at once-it seemed to be
held from the outside then he
wrenched it open and a man fell in
upon his arms-a man whose limp hand
seemed to have just fallen from the
knob

  allen let him down upon the floor
and knelt beside him it took but an
instants examination for allen to sat-
isfy himself that the man was done
for he had been shot through the
temple and might almost be said to
have died instantly as allen rose
from his knees he suddenly realized
how this affair must affect him a
murdered man in the room with him-
it would mean publicity investigation
possibly arrest and search-and he had
rantouls letters to gordon in his
pocket a sudden question that came
into his mind made him glance sharply
again at the dead man no this could
by no possibility be gordon this w as
a young man it must have been
merely chance that had sent him to this
door but it was a chance in which
allen could not afford to be entangled
he stepped out into the hall

  the elevator that had brought him
up was at the right he could hear
it ascending now and guessed swiftly
that some one was coming up from the
office to investigate the disturbance
to avoid being seen he turned hastily


the popula magazine

to the left where the hall ended in a
stairway a door slammed below and
some one came up the first flight on
the jump allen swiftly and quietly
took the second flight leading him to
the story above he would walk the
length of the hall descerid by the front
stairway and slip out while attention
was centered on the tragedy on the
second floor nothing whatsoever
would be gained by staying much
would be risked yet his action had
been directed rather by instinct than by
reason he had not had time to reason

  all might have gone as he intended
but for the fact that as he hesitated a
moment at the head of the stairs lis-
tening for any sound that would in-
dicate what was going on below a
portiere was snapped aside and a
woman faced him-a young woman
with the same intent listening look
on her face that was on allens her
eyes arrested him as though she had
spoken and in an instant she did speak

  come in here she said authorita-
tively holding aside the portiere that
masked the entrance to what was evi-
dently a private suite

  i beg pardon-

  her fingers closed upon his wrist
with a nervous grip you want to
get out without being seen very well
ill help you but you must do as i
say if you dont ill give the alarm
and say i found you skulking in my
room

 madam-

  oh good heavens dont be a fool
go inside she fairly pulled him in
from the little anteroom which was
masked by the portiere a door opened
upon a room where a table was spread
for two the chairs wrere drawn back
as though the diners had but sprung up

  listen-and answer the woman
said tensely you want to get out
of the hotel-quietly isnt that it

  yes

  so do i wait a few minutes and

we will go together you cant go
alone-because i will not let you

  allen was no more inclined than the
average man to yield under coercion
but she rather had him in a trap he
distinctly did want to get away quietly
and it was in her power to prevent it
if she wished to what her motives
or object might be he could form no
guess undoubtedly it had something
to do with the crime below but so long
as she was not the murderess-and that
her attitude made fairly certain-he
would not be compounding a felony by
accompanying her from the house
and if she was known in the hotel her
company might be as useful to him
as his could be to her she evidently
saw his yielding in his face for she
placed her hand on the back of one of
the chairs and swung it around to the
table

  sit down here she said

  he took the chair at the table for
a moment she stood beside him still
with that intent look of listening upon
her face then hastily she took the seat
opposite him and facing the door
which was at his back almost at the
instant there was a tap at the door

  come the woman called clearly
and a half-grown boy evidently a din-
ing-room waiter entered with a pot of
coffce on a tray

  you are very slow jim the woman
said sharply you have kept us wait-
ing half an hour look at my watch-
half past nine to the minute and i tel-
ephoned for that coffee at nine whats
the matter in the dining room  i shall
complain to the office she had risen
as she spoke and she took the pot
from the boys hands behind allens
back

  i came soons i could the boy mut-
tered

  what was that disturbance about
downstairs jim she asked with an
abrupt change from severity to curi-
osity
the terrace inn tragedy



  when jim asked with surprised
interest

 just now-a minute before you
came in

  i didnt hear anything the boy re-
sponded dubiously

  i wish you would go down and see
what it was she urged then come
back and let me know

  all right jim was used to carry-
ing out the erratic commands of femi-
nine guests without question he
turned to depart and the lady went
with him into the hall

  mr hunt is laughing at me for be-
ing frightened she said in an under-
tone but i am sure i heard shots
and then she paused at the top of the
stairs while jim threw himself down
in half a dozen jumps

  in a few minutes he returned a very
different expression on his careless
face

  yesm there was shooting sure
enough they say a man was killed
but i cant find out much about it yet
ill come back and let you know more

  has the-have they--do you know
who did it

  nom nobody knows they say it
was a man that ran out through the
hall

  she drew a quick breath and her
hand went up to her throat but her
voice was less strained when she spoke
again 

 how dreadful do let me know
if you find out anything more jim
and when you go down will you order
a carriage for me mr hunt has to
catch the ten oclock train order it
at once and tell them to send it to
the side door and when it comes
you telephone up to me will you
she held a coin out suggestively be-
tween thumb and finger

  yesm mrs hunt ill tend to it
right off and jim dropped down-
stairs to his own department where
mrs hunts orders were carried out

with care jim knew where his in-
terest lay

  in the meantime mrs hunt re-
turned to the apartment where she had
left allen sitting at the deserted sup-
per table he still sat there with his
back to the door she dropped into
the chair opposite rested her chin in
her cupped palm and looked at him
suddenly a smile broke the tense lines
of her face

  it was fortunate you stumbled up
here she said

  a swift wonder of fortunate for
whom went through allens mind
but he did not put it into speech he
had a feeling that the less he knew
about the situation the better

  i have ordered a carriage it will
be here immediately she continued
it will take us to the railway station
where i shall leave you

 how-

  we will take the carriage at the
side door which is used only by guests
who live here you are a guest of
mine you have been dining with me
allen bowed he guessed of course
that he was to personate some man
who had been dining with her and
whose informal departure he was to
cover the position did not please him
but he was not an officer of the law
and it was not necessary that he should
cultivate suspicion what was neces-
sary was that he should get away with-
out attracting attention unconsciously
his hand went to his breast pocket
where gordons letters were and he
drew them out enough to assure him-
self they were both there he was
suddenly nervous about them the
young woman opposite was watching
him under her eyelids but she said
nothing until the telephone tinkled

  all right she said and to allen
she added the carriage she
picked up a light wrap threw a lace
scarf over her head and opened the


the popular magazine

door to the hall here she paused a
moment making sure no one was pass-
ing  then she nodded to allen and
they went quickly down the stairway
which circled about the elevator evi-
dently the stairway was little used for
they met no one and at the foot the
young woman placed her hand on his
arm and led him quickly and silently
through an inconspicuous passageway
to an exit upon a side street here
jim was waiting by the door

  put on your hat the young woman
whispered swiftly and while she held
jims eyes with the gleam of a coin
between her thumb and finger allen
slipped past her and into the waiting
carriage in a moment she followed

  to the station jim said with
proud authority

  on the way to the station both were
silent wondering whether he would
know his companion if he should see
her again allen turned his head to
look at her as she sat beside him she
was a slight dark woman in the neigh-
borhood he guessed of twenty-five
and as the street lamps flashed their
light now and again upon her face he
saw it as a concentrated knot of de-
termination he could hardly fix her
features that look of intense concen-
tration so covered them he was not
a little startled therefore when pres-
ently she put up her hands and began
to sob silently at first the gasping
breaths shook her slight form and then
she began to wail softly

  im awfully sorry allen said awk-
wardly is there anything i can do

  oh why was i ever born  she
wailed and threw herself upon his
breast she did it so impersonally that
allen was not embarrassed though he
was surprised he felt that she had
merely sought the nearest support when
emotion overcame her and that it
should at last have broken down her
wonderful self-control was not surpris-
ing if as he suspected the friend who

had dined with her had shot the man
who lay dead in room no 

  is there anything you want me to
do  he asked gravel the carriage
had stopped and allen perceived that
they were at the station entrance if
there is tell me quickly he spoke
with a little annoyance for a waiting
porter had thrown the carriage door
open and the light of the street lamp
revealed both to him and the driver
what must have seemed like a very
tender and intimate tableau

  no no no i dont want to be fool-
ish of course you must go she said
and then to his amazement she lifted
her arms clasped them about his neck
and kissed him

  he disengaged her quickly though
gently this is carrying realism to
the limit-my compliments he said in
a tender undertone then raising his
hat and holding it so as to shield his
face he deliberately kissed her upon
the lips and stepped from the carriage
tossing a coin to the porter he hur-
ried into the station he walked
through it quickly looking about as
though searching for some one and
then went out through another door
here he made his way to a street car

  in the friendly shadow that envel-
oped the rear platform he hastily re-
viewed the astonishing events of the
evening it was not yet three hours since
he had left home knowing indeed that
he was engaged in a mission whose very
secrecy made it seem dubious but ex-
pecting merely to act the part of a faith-
ful errand boy he had been next door
to a murder he had been dangerously
close to unpleasant and risky publicity
he had had an amazing encounter with
a remarkable woman he had missed
the appointment with senator gordon
-or mcgrath-but at any rate he still
had the sealed letters for the preserva-
tion of which he had acted so disin-
genuous a part his hand went to the
pocket where he had placed them-and
the terrjcb inn tcrmgecdy



fell away as though it had been para-
lyzed

  the pocket was empty-the letters
were gone

chapter iii

  allens dismay on discovering that
the letters which rantoul had intrusted
to him were gone was so overwhelming
that for a time it simply blotted every-
thing else out of his consciousness he
out of all the harassed old mans
friends had been chosen for this mis-
sion because of his special trustwor-
thiness and he had bungled matters
like the veriest tyro of course he must
get the letters back he would go to
the terrace inn the first thing in the
morning and confront that amazing
woman and demand his property what
her object could have been in robbing
him he could not guess she could
hardly have known what the letters
were perhaps she was just a common
pickpocket taking a chance perhaps
she would be gone like her suppositi-
tious husband by the time he could get
there pie tossed restlessly through the
night and was up as soon as daylight
gave him an excuse he saw the morn-
ing newsboy toss a twisted paper into
mrs gardners nasturtium bed and he
went down for a first glimpse the pa-
per would have something about the
tragedy probably

 it did the front page held this
item

man murdered in the terrace
inn

  a mysterious murder was committed last
night in the terrace inn a quiet family hotel
on elliott street the victim was j w
mcgrath address unknown

  mcgrath registered at the hotel yesterday
afternoon paying in advance he went out
almost immediately telling the clerk that he
would return in the evening a little be-
fore nine oclock a man called to see him
and was conducted by the bell boy to mc-
graths room mcgrath was not in but as
the door was ajar the visitor said he would
wait and the boy left him in the vacant room

ca

about half an hour later the clerk was
startled by hearing shots on the floor above
and rushed up mcgrath was found on the
floor in his room dead from a shot through
the temple

  the mysterious visitor who called on mc-
grath had disappeared a waiter from the
dining room was near the back stairway
and he claims that he saw a man rush past
him and go out through the rear door his
testimony is expected to prove valuable

  mcgrath was apparently about twenty-five
years old and had dark hair and eyes one
peculiar feature of the case is that there was
nothing in his pockets to identify him and
in registering he gave no address he wore
a new suit of ready-made clothing and his
underwear was new throughout the only
article in his pockets was a handkerchief
which has never been laundered the man
who shot him must have also robbed him

  the police have a good description of the
man who called fqr mcgrath in the even-
ing and are working on the clew develop-
ments are expected shortly

  allens eye flashed through these
short but important paragraphs and
then he read them again very slowly
and carefully as though he were com-
mitting each item to memory then
he twisted up the paper and dropped it
back in the bed of nasturtiums and re-
turned quietly to his room when he
came down to breakfast an hour later
the little black mustache which in for-
eign fashion had adorned his upper lip
since his return had disappeared and
instead of the poole clothes which he
had been wearing with much satisfac-
tion he was in tennis flannels

  antonia stole a glance of secret ad-
miration at the athletic figure he pre-
sented but jessie gardner regarded
him with frank sisterly appraisal

  what did you take it off for she
demanded i think you looked more
distinguished with your nice little black
mustache

  i feel more american without it
i must have some clothes too intro-
duce me to your tailor wilton
with pride when

  i think ill stroll down with you
when you go to the office


the popular magazine

  stroll people dont stroll in amer-
ica howard they go to the office in
an electric car either public or private
wheres the paper lizzie

  allen watched his brother-in-law
without seeming to do so as gardner
unfolded the paper he glanced at all
the headlines turned over to read the
stock reports glanced at the sporting
page and then turned back to the front
page folding the paper so that he
could read the story of the terrace inn
murder at ease he propped it against
the sugar bowl and read the account
which allen knew almost by heart with
deliberate care

  anything in the paper wilton
asked jessie she was never wholly
reconciled to her husbands unsocial
habit of reading the paper at the break-
fast table so she tried conscientiously
to drag conversation out of it since she
could not prevent it

  a job for doran gardner an-
swered absently feeling blindly for his
toast

  oh good  exclaimed jessie

  at that gardner looked up with a
short laugh and shook his head good
lord what creatures women are

  well- said jessie protestingly

  gardner turned to allen with an air
your sister allen would you have
believed it of her i tell her that a
murder has been committed-a murder
most foul and dark as somebody says
-and her only comment is oh
good 

  antonia turned her soft eyes full of
questioning loyalty upon jessie oh
but she didnt mean that i know she
breathed

  doran is the new coroner said
jessie to howard in explanation he
is a friend of ours and wilton helped
get him elected of course i am sorry
people have to be murdered in order
that a coroner may live but since they
will get murdered coroner or no coro-
ner im glad to have them get mur-

dered in dorans precinct she fin-
ished with a mocking little face at her
husband

  i suppose it means that i shall have
to attend the inquest said gardner
doran made me promise that i would
stand by as a personal and unofficial
counselor the first time he had to con-
duct an inquest he is nervous about
the technique of the proceedings
who is the murderee wilton
asked jessie with ostentatious sang-
froid any one we know

  j w mcgrath his name is

  dont know him not in our set
and the murderer

  didnt leave his card mystery
about it read it yourself he pushed
the paper across the table and gave un-
divided attention to his egg

  allen had been thinking he felt
that he ought to know all that could
be known in regard to the man who
had been killed in gordons room-he
was too closely mixed up in the affair
to be indifferent to any aspect of it
and though the newspaper assurance
that the man who had called on mc-
grath would be traced had led him to
make some obvious changes in his ap-
pearance he had no intention of being
forced into hiding

  would it be possible for me to ac-
company you he asked gardner i
have never attended an inquest in my
life and i think i should like to know
something about the technique of the
proceedings myself

  certainly you can carry my green
bag and go as my clerk

  oh howard murmured antonia
with shy protest

  thats what men are like tonia
said jessie with cheerful resignation
you just have to get used to them
at that moment the telephone rang
in the butlers pantry and everybody
stopped talking while lizzie answered
the call in a moment she appeared
mr allen is wanted at the phone
the terjcb inn tragedy



  allen threw down his napkin and
went to the phone fully conscious that
every word he spoke would be over-
heard even if the family made a polite
pretense of talking among themselves
as he had anticipated it was rantouls
voice in the phone

  hello that you howie how do
things go 

  may i come and see you to-day
allen asked by way of answer

  cant you tell me over the phone
what he said 

  thank you the family are all well
allen remarked distinctly they are
all right here at breakfast

rantouls chuckle came faintly over
the wire all right howie i catch
the idea well make it a game of
yes and no did you see gordon
no

  the devil you didnt what slipped
up 

yes said allen with emphasis
oh confound you i cant pick
things out of you that way go some-
where where you can telephone me in-
telligently

  my only engagement in the imme-
diate future said allen conversation-
ally is to attend an inquest with wil-
ton there was a murder at the ter-
race inn last night-some one by the
name of j w mcgrath was killed

  gad howie whats that

  -and wilton is going to attend

the inquest professionally and im go-
ing for the sake of my general infor-
mation thats all i know about it
are you telling me that gordon was
killed last night

  no

  is there anything in the paper about
it

  yes everything

  you have the letters-

  allen snapped the receiver on before
the question could be fully formed

that definitely was a question he could
not answer over the phone

  he went out to the front hall where
gardner was getting ready to depart
for his office

  hop in how if you are going down
with me

  allen turned to antonia cant we
have a game of tennis when i come
back from the dressmakers you see
i dressed for it-in hopes and while
he spoke a half-amused wonder ran
through his mind whether he really was
as adroit as all this by nature he had
donned the tennis suit because a sudden
subconscious warning had told him not
to wear again the clothes in which he
had visited the terrace inn and now
to justify the flannels he must beg a
game and use up time which he might
well have spent in considering the va-
rious aspects of the complicated cir-
cumstances within which he stood

  yes indeed murmured antonia
with shy pleasure she had fully in-
tended to make this morning serve the
purpose which had been frustrated last
night by going out to see abram ma-
kowskys sick uncle but wasnt it
admitted that charity should begin at
home and wasnt it being charitable
to do something for the stranger who
had just returned home after five long
years of absence she would go out
quietly by herself in the afternoon
after the game was over no need to
take any one antonia was shy about
her charities-which wrere numerous
yes indeed ill be glad to have a
game slje murmured

  gardner left his brother-in-law at his
tailors and here allen exercised his
diplomatic gifts so skillfully that the
tailor not only promised to produce the
clothes he ordered with unprecedented
swiftness but even to fit him out tem-
porarily with the makeshift street suit
which he insisted he must have for the
afternoon

  he did not perhaps know himself


the populacr magazine

what a triumph that concession was
but as he strolled back to antonia and
the tennis court he did reflect with
some amusement on his flora mcflim-
seylike state that poor devil that had
been killed last night-mcgrath-he
too had been dressed in new togs
throughout the paper said had that
been for the purpose of avoiding recog-
nition who wras mcgrath anyway
how was he mixed up with gordon
and who had killed him a mystery
the paper had called it as the mur-
derer had escaped and was not likely
to come back for the purpose of clear-
ing things up it might remain a mys-
tery forever they said the police had
a clew but it was allens clear convic-
tion that the clew led straight to him

  when he reached the house antonia
was ready and he stopped only for the
balls and rackets before setting cut for
the court which was a block away
from the house

  there was a telephone call for you
antonia said lizzie wrote the num-
ber on the pad perhaps youd better
see-

  allen went back and looked at the
pad it was rantouls number

  that will keep until afternoon he
said we mustnt let business inter-
fere with tennis

  the court was in good condition but
allen played a poor game yet now
curiously enough it was not the loss of
the letters that oppressed him he had
made up his mind to attempt their re-
covery and so dismissed the thought
of them for the time being but con-
stantly there swam into that inner field
of vision which memory beholds the
outline of the man who had fallen into
his arms when he opened the door the
face that had been turned up to him
when he laid the man upon the floor
and knelt for a moment beside him
let no one say that death is a trivial
matter to be treated lightly by the phil-
osophical it is a sacred mystery and

he who has seen it has seen the gods
at their work making and remaking the
world

   allen spun the game out till luncheon
time then he improvised an engage-
ment downtown as an excuse for not
entering the house he must keep out
of the telephone reach of rantoul until
he knew better where he stood-and
he could not go calling on the resource-
ful lady of the terrace inn until he had
some proper clothes such was the ami-
ability of wiltons tailor however that
a few hours later a well-dressed young
man with no touch of london about
his clothes paused to buy an afternoon
paper from a small newsboy in the little
triangular park that faced the terrace
inn

  all-about-eh-murders on the last
page said the boy helpfully

  oh do you read your own papers
asked allen turning to the last page
accordingly

  course id read about a murder in
my own hotel said the boy

  allen glanced at him sharply how
your hotel  he asked the boy was
ragged and looked uncared for beyond
the average but he might possibly be
the son of some hotel servant he had
the sharp pinched face of a worried
squirrel and below the impudent assur-
ance of his look there was something
of the dumb wistfulness of an animal-
or of an overburdened child do you
mean that you live over there 

  naw said the boy in disgust and
plainly suspicious of chaffing

  oh you mean you sell papers
there do you know the names of any
of the people living there he put
the question casually and in a conversa-
tional tone but the boy watched him
warily

  some of em he answered non-
committally

  do you know the name of the peo-
ple who have rooms on the third floor
the tecrcrfice inn trgedy

ioi

-a man and his wife-the man went
away last night

  say are you a tec demanded the
boy it was evident that though sus-
picion bade him flee curiosity held him
bound

  of course not i should think youd
be sharp enough to know better than
that im just curious so you dont
know his name

  hunt thats in the paper

  allen ran his eye over the afternoon
papers rehash of the morning papers
story there was little additional in-
formation except that it mentioned the
time and place of the inquest and in-
dicated that everybody who could throw
any light on the affair had been sum-
moned by the coroner a mr warren
hunt who lived at the hotel had left
on the ten-oclock train for chicago it
appeared but that was a matter of no
importance one was to infer as there
were still a great many people in the
hotel who could be questioned the
one important point was that the mur-
derer had run out into the street imme-
diately after the crime though there
now seemed some confusion as to
whether he had run out through the
ofhce or through the back hall

  allen folded the paper and slipped
it into his pocket then the boys hun-
gry look-allen thought again of a
worried squirrel unable to voice his
anxiety-caught his attention and his
fingers came out of his pocket with a
coin

  here get yourself some supper-no
cigarettes mind whats your name
by the way

  abram makowrsky the boy an-
swered subdued into civility by the
glint of silver

  oh hello exclaimed allen recall-
ing antonias concern hows your
uncle abram 

  but this was too much with the
snort of a little wild creature the child
sprang away and only at a safe dis-

tance did he pause to glare back at the
man who wanted to know so many
things

  allen crossed the street to the hotel
it was not without an inward quiver
that he approached the desk but as
good fortune would have it the man of
whom he had made his inquiries the
evening before was not there instead
a young woman took his card and di-
rected him to a small waiting room
while she sent a bell boy up to mrs
hunt

  very promptly his card was answered
by the appearance of mrs hunt herself
-mrs hunt hatted and dressed for
the street she looked at him steadily
unsmilingly for a moment as he rose
to his feet at her approach then a
flicker of something like mockery
passed over her face

  i thought you would come she
said composedly i am just going out
will you walk a little way with me
allen bowed and without further
words she led the way to the street
door as they stepped out allen
glanced across at the little park oppo-
site and saw the small abram makow-
sky taking the situation in with alert
observation

  i thought you would come mrs
hunt repeated as he fell into step with
her slow movement though we are
neither of us far enough out of the
wood to make it a very wise thing for
you to do still as i guessed that you
would be plucky rather than wise i
waited for you what is it you want
i think you know

  i prefer to have you say

  very well when i left you last
night--after i left you-i missed some
papers-two sealed letters i had had
in my pocket

  and you think you may have left
them in my room 

  he looked down at her without an-
swering


the cpocpular magazine

   or could it be that you left them in
 -some other room 

   allen could not help an inward trib-
 ute to her cleverness indeed if she
 denied knowledge of the papers what
 could he do he could not as a matter
 of fact be absolutely certain himself
 as to their whereabouts unless he could
 compel her to own up to having them
 he adopted an attitude of pained dis-
 approval

   this evasiveness is not worthy of
you

   what is or is not worthy of me is
the last thing you can know mr allen
however i would gain nothing by eva-
siveness in this case so i dont mind
telling you that you are quite right in
guessing that i took the letters from
your pocket in the carriage i was
mighty thankful to get hold of them
do you want to know what i am going
to do with them 

   return them to me i hope

  a vain hope mr allen and you
were sensible to say merely hope not
expect you know very well i am
not going to return them to you-yet
what do you suppose i took them for 
i have not the slightest idea

   oh you do yourself injustice i am
 sure you must have guessed that i
 took them to hold as a hostage for your
 silence she looked up with a swift
 glance of assured triumph

   allen had focused all his faculties in
 an effort to understand the woman and
 he could see plainly enough that under
 her surface composure she was exces-
 sively nervous there was a throb in
 the pulses of her throat a quiver in her
 voice that betrayed deep though con-
 trolled emotion there was no com-
 fort for him in the discovery he felt
 the impossibility of turning her

   my silence regarding what please
be definite

   everything that occurred last night
 everything there will be an inquest

i shall have to appear if you contra-
dict my story or break your silence in
any way i shall give those letters to
the papers

 have you read them he de-
manded in astonishment

  certainly do you think i am play-
ing a childs game you know what
a sensation they will make if published
is it worth your while to run that risk
and here she distinctly had him at a
disadvantage for though she might not
guess it he did not share her knowl-
edge of the contents of those fatal let-
ters she said they would make a sen-
sation if even she a woman saw that
they probably were highly inflammable 
if i accept your terms promise to

keep silence-

  she shrugged her shoulders lightly
and with a not ungraceful movement

  i am not asking your promise-i
have the letters speak and i publish
them keep silent and i keep quiet
nothing could be simpler

  nor more complete said allen
with indignant bitterness he felt in-
deed that she held him in a cleft stick

  i should hope so said mrs hunt
composedly i have enough to think
of heaven knows without you making
complications and now that that is
settled and you understand what you
have to do allow me to repeat what i
said before that it is not altogether
prudent for us to be seen together
there is too much at stake i think it
will be well for you to leave me at the
corner

  i bow to your superior manage-
ment said allen sardonically

  as allen replaced the hat he had
automatically raised to her retreating
back he found himself face to face with
miss clio ellerson whose approach he
had not noticed

  good afternoon mr allen she
said carelessly as she passed him but
the glance she sent after the departing
the tetrcrjice inn trjgedy



figure of mrs hunt was not careless
and he saw it

  confound it all he muttered to
himself it would not have been polite
-or just-to confound miss ellerson
for chancing to be on the street at that
moment but he felt a need to vent his
annoyance somehow he swore imper-
sonally and inaudibly for half a block
and then turned his head to see which
way she had gone she was talking
with abram makowsky at the edge of
the little park that sight did not
soothe his irritation what possible
occasion could miss ellerson have to
talk to the boy he had just been quiz-
zing

  on the car going home he pulled
abram makowskys newspaper from
his pocket the world was still wag-
ging and there must be something in
it besides that all-about-e-murder on
the last page

  there was on the front page in
large type was the query 

  where is senator gordon

  beneath this a mock-serious para-
graph told that this morning on the
convening of legislature after a three-
day recess senator gordons seat was
vacant though important measures in
which he was known to be interested
were pending he had not been at his
hotel and a telegraphic inquiry directed
to his home had brought out simply the
information that he was not there

  it was evident that the story was
the work of some reporter who was
trying to make copy on very slender
foundations probably the privileged
newspaper man was trying to chaff the
distinguished senator but-if the
question should not be answered by to-
morrow or by the next day-it would
be no matter for chaffing it would
be serious allen felt the tide of alarm
rising to his throat there was nothing
for it but to go and see rantoul and
have the matter out with him

chapter iv

  allen came away from rantouls
house late that evening feeling bruised
and battered in all his nerves and sym-
pathies the hero of his boyhood
whose splendid courage and vibrant
personality had dazzled his mind and
formed a glorious standard which had
largely influenced his own development
was certainly showing the touch of age
the sight filled allen with passionate
pity more than ever he felt that he
must protect him save him-save him
not only from external disaster but
even more save him from the humilia-
tion of such self-betrayals as he had
just witnessed

  rantoul had been so panic-stricken at
the news that his letters to gordon had
reached other hands that allen could
only draw the most damning inferences
as to their contents

  but cant you get them back from
her  it isnt possible that you cant
he had repeated again and again

  it isnt safe to try if it would be

fatal to have them made public-

  why it would be ruin

then the thing to do is to keep
quiet that is the price of her silence
how you could have bungled so

simple a-

  but that was a profitless field and
allen did not try to defend himself
he was quite willing to admit that he
had bungled things but a pickpocket
so skillful as mrs hunt was hardly
among the ordinary contingencies which
he might have foreseen and if it came
to fixing the ultimate responsibility he
felt that to write anything so explo-
sive as these secret letters must have
been was the initial blunder but he
did not have the heart to point this
out he merely tried to find out how
things really stood

  you have no idea then he asked
rantoul why gordon didnt come to
the rendezvous


the popular magazine

  you dont know that he didnt as i
understand it said rantoul impatient-
ly you say that the room was empty
when you went in but it had been
taken in the name of mcgrath that
was the name gordon was to use

  this was not gordon-the man who
took the room and who was killed
this was quite a young fellow-twenty-
odd i should say probably gordon
sent an emissary-as you did and
his emissary was killed while yours
was robbed a pretty mix altogether
rantoul shook his head dubiously
i dont believe gordon sent any one in
his place he probably was there and
when the excitement of the murder
called attention to his room he simply
slipped away he didnt want to be
called on for explanations of course
and because the dead man was found
in the room taken in the name of mc-
grath the hotel people-or the police
-jumped to the conclusion that he was
mcgrath you may be sure gordon
wouldnt be the one to set them right
gordons whereabouts are unknown
according to the evening paper-you
have seen it

  yes

  does that suggest anything to your
mind 

  no hell turn up it would be
altogether too good luck if he didnt
if only he had been the one killed
you are quite sure there isnt any possi-
bility that it was he 

  not a chance smiled allen

  pity i could have spared him so
easily  oh howie if only you hadnt
let that siren bamboozle you

  allen felt that it was hardly worth
while to point out that he had been
tricked not bamboozled and that a
subtle difference was involved he saw
that rantouls mind was so absorbed
in the effect of the affair upon himself
that he could spare no attention to con-
sidering its general aspects

  but after allen had left the har-

assed old man barely in time to catch
the last suburban train for town he
gave himself up during the quiet hour
of the trip - to considering these as-
pects as he worked them out they
fell into about this order

  if mcgrath was gordons nom de
guerre the young fellow who had been
killed was not mcgrath as everybody
assumed

  the police working on the theory
that he was mcgrath would be follow-
ing a false trail the man might never
be identified in that case did not an
obligation rest upon him to set them
right 

  he could take no open step in the
matter without risk of mrs hunts car-
rying out her threat to publish the sto-
len letters

  his silence would presumably help
the murderer to escape and to that ex-
tent would be a thwarting of justice
that was not a comfortable thought
but he decided firmly that it was better
to let a murderer escape if circum-
stances and his destiny enabled him to
do so than to wreck the reputation of
a man like rantoul

  his obligation of silence should not
go to a point where an innocent person
might be put in jeopardy he could see
possibilities of development along this
line where it might become necessary
to sacrifice rantoul

  gordons part in the whole affair was
mysterious why had he not kept his
appointment  was mcgrath his emis-
sary what had become of him

  who was the man mrs hunt was
protecting was it hunt and did
she know wrho mcgrath was

  and finally what might he have let
himself in for he realized that if he
should become involved in a public
scandal or anything of that sort it
would be a serious matter for his pro-
fessional future yes rantoul had cer-
tainly taken a rather unfair advantage
of his friendship
the tetrcrlce inn trgedy



  it was after midnight when he let
himself into the house of his brother-
in-law with that amiable relatives
latchkey when he had stumbled
against the hatrack and knocked over
a hall chair wilton in pajamas hos-
pitably turned on the light in the upper
hall

  hello you nocturnal wanderer
what sent you home so early

  ive been out to see mr rantoul
said allen he didnt feel equal to any
liveliness of retort

  by the way added wilton sleepily
you really want to attend that in-
quest 

  yes i do

  all right be ready then its to-
morrow at nine

chapter v

  the first person allen saw when he
entered the room where the inquest was
to be held was clio ellerson the sight
somehow startled him even when he
remembered as he did at the second
thought that she was probably there
for her paper and that her attendance
was therefore natural and to be ex-
pected he had an unquiet feeling which
refused to explain itself that her pres-
ence was for him in some way por-
tentous it was one of those subtle
intuitions that prove to us occasion-
ally that there is an alert consciousness
in us which lies deeper than the brain

  but he resolutely turned his attention
from her and listened to the proceed-
ings of the inquest beyond what he
had anticipated the affair had an at-
mosphere of solemnity a crime had
been committed against the laws which
society and the growing conscience of
the race have established and here the
law safeguarding society was making
an earnest attempt to discover the
truth the means might be inadequate
the result imperfect but the object was
profoundly impressive-

  the hotel clerk was the first person

questioned he was an alert intelli-
gent man and he testified clearly to the
little he knew

  j w mcgrath had come in about
eight oclock on tuesday evening and
asked for a room for the night the
room had been reserved by wire several
days before he had referred to the
reservation had paid for the room in
advance and had been taken up by the
boy a few minutes later he had come
downstairs and gone out no one had
seen him come in again and burkey
the clerk testifying did not know that
he was in the house until he was found
in his room dead

  could he have come in again with-
out being seen by some one the coro-
ner asked

  oh yes my office is near the front
door but i was out it is often vacant
we dont expect transients most of
our people have apartments by the
season -

  then it would seem that mcgrath
was not acquainted with the character
of your house since he wired in ad-
vance for a room 

  that struck me at the time

  where did he wire from

  i didnt notice at the time and since
this happened i have hunted for the
telegram but have been unable to find
it it must have gone into the waste-
basket

  did he say anything when he went
out 

  no he went out in a hurry and
passed me in the door but he said noth-
ing i went out just a minute after him
and i saw him cross the street and
stop to speak to a man on the other
sidewalk i went on without paying
any further attention to them

  what sort of a man

  well i couldnt say there was
nothing noticeable about him as far as
i could see-it was a good ways off
and it was rather dark and i didnt
pay special attention it just struck
the cpocpulacr magazine

me that he was asking his way or some-
thing like that and i wondered a little
that he hadnt asked me but i didnt
think much about it

  would it have been possible for him
to bring the stranger in with him and
go up to his room without being seen
yes quite possible mr cook is
supposed to be in the office when i am
not there but as i said the office is
often vacant for a short time when we
both are called away

  describe the arrangement of the of-
fice and hall please

  the office is to the left of the front
entrance opposite it with the hall be-
tween is a reception room back of
the office is the elevator with a stair-
way winding about it some people
use the stairway going up to the next
floor beyond that is a cross hall that
leads out to the side street and a back
hall with stairway beyond that again
is the dining room to one side and the
back offices and kitchens on the other
then this man could have come and
gone either by the front door or the
side door or the kitchen hall 

  yes--if he knew his way

  and the murderer might have es-
caped in any of those ways

  yes

  mcgrath had no luggage

  no when i asked about his lug-
gage he said curtly my grip was sto-
len on the train but he paid in ad-
vance for the room so it made no dif-
ference to me

  for how long did he pay

  for twenty-four hours

  did he seem excited was there
anything in his manner to attract atten-
tion 

  his manner was curt and abrupt
he seemed impatient but there was
nothing extraordinary about him i
thought at the time that he was probably
in a temper over the loss of his bag
did he mention any names ask
for any one

  no

  did any one ask for him

  not wrhile i was there but while
i was out for supper he had a caller
mr cook the bookkeeper was in
charge of the office while i was out
with an intimation that he would be
recalled later the clerk was temporarily
dismissed and the bookkeeper cook
was called

  tell in your own way mr cook
about the man who called to see the de-
ceased

  cook was evidently flustered by the
responsibility which circumstances had
thrust upon him he was the man to
whom allen had addressed his in-
quiries but after the first minute allen
knew that he had nothing to fear from
the unobservant and untrained mind of
the young bookkeeper he told his
story hurriedly and without detail

  why he just came in and asked
for mcgrath and i sent him up with
the bell hop and thats the last i knew
about it then burkey came back and
baring and i went out for a feed
what sort of a man was he

  why i didnt notice

  what time was it

  well i didnt exactly notice

 you didnt see him leave the
house 

  no-sure i didnt

  what time were you on duty
  from eight to nine

  then he must have called before
nine

  why yes of course

  and thats all the information that
you can give

  the bookkeeper grinned apologeti-
cally undeniably allen felt relieved
but as the thought passed his mind
that he had nothing to fear now in the
way of identification with that nights
adventures he glanced without intent
in the direction of miss ellerson and
was startled at the look on her face
she was covertly watching him if he
the terrace inn tragedy



had caught her eye upon him merely
he would have thought nothing of it
but it was the fact that she was observ-
ing him askance that surprised him
why should she be watching him in
his amaze he missed the question to
which the witness next replied

  baring was with me-evan bar-
ing

  is evan baring in the room

  a young man stepped forward it
was the young fellow who had been in
the office with the bookkeeper and al-
len saw instantly that this was a man
of a different type

  after the preliminary questions he
testified

  yes i was in the office when the
man came in who asked for mcgrath
he was a young man of about twenty-
nine slight build somewhat above the
average in height dark hair and mus-
tache he wore a dark-gray suit eng-
lish cut and carried a cane a bit of
a dandy i should say

  allen gasped a little at that in spite
of himself he stole a look at miss el-
lerson but she was looking straight at
the witness this time and nowhere
else

  would you know him again mr
baring

  id know the clothes again-sure
unless he alters his looks purposely i
think id know him again in any
clothes

  what is your business mr bar-
ing 

  im a-a detective

  attached to the police force

  no on my own account private
office

  there was no reason why that an-
swer should excite mirth but a smile
rippled around the room perhaps it
was the incongruity between the im-
pressiveness of the claim and the boy-
ish look of the claimant baring felt
the amusement and his jaw set

  were you in the hotel at the time

of the murder mr baring asked the
coroner

  no i went out with cook when
mr burkey returned-a minute or two
after nine

  then you know nothing about what
happened later

  i know nothing about what hap-
pened later baring echoed there
was something dogged in his tone that
apparently caught dorans attention as
it did allens for he looked at the wit-
ness thoughtfully for a moment and
then asked 

  or before or at any time have
you any further information that might
help to throw light upon the murder 
baring paused a moment before an-
swering and his eyes in an absent
meditative fashion wandered across the
room to clio ellerson who was giving
close attention to the proceedings al-
len keenly watchful was certain that
it was not a chance glance but after
that meditative pause merely enough
to refresh his memory baring shook
his head and answered doran directly
no i have no further information
that would throw any light on the mur-
der i went out with cook but i left
him at the door and went downtown
i heard nothing about the murder until
i saw the paper the next morning and
then of course i remembered the man
who had come to the office to inquire
for him

  you have given his description to
the police

  yes sir

  that will do for the present mr
baring

  burkey the clerk was recalled
tell about your finding the body
mr burkey

  i was at my desk in the office when
i heard the sound of a shot at the
first instant i didnt realize it was a
shot i just said to myself that
sounds like a shot-wonder what it
was then i heard it again and i


the populzr magazine

knew it was a shot and that it was up-
stairs i made a dive for the elevator
and let myself up when i got to the
second floor there was no one to be
seen though i heard the sound of some
one in the rear of the hall i started
to run that way when i saw that room
no  was open i pulled up went in
and there was mcgrath on the floor
i stopped to examine him lift him up
he was dead then joe the elevator
man who had been out in the hall
came tearing up to find why i had taken
the elevator and i sent him back to
telephone for the police while i locked
the room and went down the back way
to see if there was any one there but
of course there wasnt whoever it
was i had heard could have gone out
the back way without any difficulty as
the back stairs lead down to a hall that
opens on the side street

  is that passage ever used by the
guests of the house asked doran

  they do sometimes for a short cut
though it is intended for servants and
tradesmen

  did you see any one at all when
you went through 

  one of the dining-room waiters
jim was going upstairs and when i
looked out of the door i saw cook on
the opposite sidewalk i called to him
to come in and set him in charge of
the office by this time the policeman
had come and i took him up to room
no  and unlocked the door

  wilton gardner who was present in
the interests of the new coroner passed
a scribbled slip to doran who read it in
his palm then he recalled cook the
bookkeeper who had proved so ineffi-
cient a witness before

  you were standing on the opposite
sidewalk when mr burkey called you
in how long had you been there
oh just a few minuteg

 five minutes ten minutes
twenty minutes 

  maybe ten minutes

  did you see any one leave the house
by that side door while you stood
there 

  yes i saw the man i took for
hunt said cook looking uncomfort-
able

  you saw a man you took for mr
hunt you think now it was not mr
hunt

  no jim says mr hunt was in his
room

  you thought at the time it was mr
hunt

  yes

  did you speak of this to any one

  yes i told burkey but just then
jim came down from upstairs and says
mr and mrs hunt were eating supper
in their room

  can you describe the man you saw
come out

  no i didnt notice particularly i
just thought it was mr hunt and
didnt notice

  did the man seem in a hurry-run-
ning

  no just walking kinda fast

  so the alibi was by way of being
established allen moved restlessly
and as he turned his head he saw a
figure he had not noticed before-mrs
hunt she had just thrown back the
veil that had obscured her features and
she was looking at him with a quiet
direct gaze that would mean nothing to
any one else but that he could not mis-
take a moment later the coroner said
deferentially mrs hunt and she
rose and came forward

  i asked the privilege of giving my
testimony under oath she said in a
self-possessed manner after the pre-
liminary identification because of the
absurd rumor in the hotel starting from
the gossip of mr cook the bookkeeper
who thought he saw my husband leav-
ing the hotel by the rear entrance that
evening shortly after nine mr hunt
was with me in my room until nearly
ten when we went together in a car-
the tertrjlce inn tragedy



riage to the station jim the waiter
brought us some coffee at half past
nine i noticed the time because he had
kept us waiting nearly half an hour
and i spoke to him sharply about it
i hope you will take his testimony jim
called a carriage for us and we left
shortly before ten if necessary the
driver will doubtless be found to give
testimony that i took him to the station
and p-parted from him there her
self-control seemed to break a moment
at the word and she touched her eyes
delicately with her handkerchief

  doran the coroner was a polite man
and not without susceptibility to femi-
nine charms-and mrs hunt looked
charming in her black gown

  it is hardly necessary to follow the
matter up madam but out of defer-
ence to your very natural desire to
make it impossible for the cruel serpent
of gossip to raise its venomous head
in the future i will call jim owens

  jim owens the waiter testified that
he had taken a pot of coffee to the
hunt apartment at half past nine and
had then told mr and mrs hunt about
the murder which had taken place on
the floor below he had ordered a car-
riage for them and had seen them enter
and drive off a little before ten he
was well acquainted with mr hunt
and swore positively on the point of
seeing him at the table and again en-
tering the carriage and doran who
was doubtless a better politician than
psychologist never questioned the pos-
sibility that a mans eyes might deceive
him when he looked for what he ex-
pected to see he turned to mrs hunt
with a smile of reassurance

  the record of this examination will
be your complete protection against
calumny he said with his slightly
exaggerated air of deference the
snake of suspicion has been scotched
forever

  and mrs hunt bowing slightly in
acknowledgment allowed her eyes to

slide from the face of the coroner to
allens he met her look with its
carefully concealed triumph with an
air of complete detachment but his soul
seethed within in a tumult of exaspera-
tion bitterly now he regretted that
he had come to the inquest if the
time should come when it would be nec-
essary for him to give his testimony in
the interest of justice he would cut a
sorry figure in recounting how this
woman had forced him to sit silent
while her adroit perjury went on
record

  it was with relief that he saw the
session was drawing toward its close
and that gardner was preparing to
leave he stood a little apart waiting
for gardner who was speaking to the
coroner and watching the people w-ho
drew together into little groups they
spoke softly among themselves as
though they were at a funeral one by
one they drifted out of the room mrs
hunt who had dropped an obscuring
veil over her face immediately after
giving her testimony managed to pass
him on her way from the room

  you see it was simple enough she
murmured as she passed him

  that may be a matter of opinion
he retorted you will be so obliging
as to remember that i am bound by no
promises

  i do not think a promise would add
anything to the situation she an-
swered sweetly and passed on

  allen turned abruptly-and encoun-
tered the eyes of evan baring fixed
upon him with a puzzled scrutiny on
the impulse of the moment and without
explaining his action to himself allen
nodded as if in recognition of an ac-
quaintance baring returned the greet-
ing automatically and then turned to
miss ellerson near whom he was
standing allen would have given
something to hear their conversation
he was certain that he was the subject
-as he was he would have been edi-
no

the vow lai magazine

fied if he could have listened for evan
baring said to clio ellerson

  who is that man in gray near the
door he just nodded to me i know
ive met the guy but i cant for the
life of me speak his name

  clio answered without looking in the
direction of the door-which baring
might have construed as a significant
fact if he had been in his best form

  that is howard allen she said
i told you about him the other day
the dickens it is the man who
shot down the rioters one of your
quiet deadly sort evan turned again
to study the figure in gray now depart-
ing with undisguised interest but
say what made him nod to me  i
never met him i wouldnt have for-
gotten that you bet

  miss ellerson looked at evan with
the air of thoughtful consideration that
occasionally made him feel very young
indeed

  you were staring at him she said
quietly i noticed it and so of course
did he he probably thought you were
staring because you recognized him and
so he nodded in greeting he probably
thought that he was at fault in not
recognizing some one he ought to have
remembered-a stranger is apt to con-
fuse the faces he knows and those he
has merely seen in the street

  i suppose thats it evan conceded
evidently impressed by her elaborate
reasoning but i was staring because
he made me think of some one i have
seen recently-some one i didnt know
who came up out of the dark and said
something jerusalem and jumping
cats i know who it was he made me
think of the man who asked for mc-
grath at the terrace inn 

  miss ellerson did not look as sur-
prised as he might have expected
dont let the mcgrath mystery get on
your brain she said impatiently

  but he does look like him

  you didnt notice it at first mr

allen has been in the room all through
the proceedings

  no i didnt notice him till just
as he was leaving of course it was
just one of those chance resemblances
that sometimes strike you between peo-
pie who perhaps dont look alike really
but say i was so dead sure id rec-
ognize that man if i saw him anywhere
and now i feel all mixed up if i could
think allen looked like him i cant trust
my recollection he thrust his hands
deep in his pockets and looked at her
with mingled dejection and exaspera-
tion

  what would you do asked miss
ellerson slowly if you should - really
see-and identify-the man who in-
quired for mcgrath

  have him arrested of course on
the spot his eyes danced gee i
wish i had the chance you bet they
wouldnt grin the next time i said i
was a detective

  you think then that the man who
inquired for mcgrath was the man who
killed him

  well hed have to show us who did
if he wanted anybody to believe he
didnt i guess the third degree would
soon settle it

  miss ellerson was silent and thought-
ful for some moments

  what is the first thing you look for
when you are trying to solve a mys-
terious crime  she asked suddenly a
motive isnt it

  yes a motive is important espe-
cially when you have no facts if you
have facts of course you have to build
from them now the man who called
to see mcgrath was a fact if we knew
wrho he was then wed try to find out
whether he had any motive for killing
mcgrath-since nobody actually saw
the murder if he had no motive-
well probably he wouldnt have killed
him in that case but evidently he did
so evidently he must have had a mo-
tive
the terrjcb inn tragedy

in

  you are arguing in a circle evan
said miss ellerson earnestly but if

you knew who that man was-

  id look for the connection between
them-it might be a woman or a quar-
rel or business interests or rivalry of
some sort theres where id expect to
find the motive gee miss ellerson
i wish you had seen that man while you
sat there in the park you might have
recognized him

  possibly said miss ellerson dryly
did the man you were waiting to in-
terview come along 

  no he didnt i didnt tell you who
it was evan when you stopped to
speak to me because i didnt want to
explain just then but the fact was
that i was waiting for senator gordon
i got a tip that he had been seen at the
terrace inn and i went up to catch an

so i sat down on the bench in that park
where i could watch the door but
gordon didnt come

  baring stared at her with every sense
alert-the hunting dog guessing at a
scent before it is fairly on the air

well but that may be very important
miss ellerson they say that gordon
is missing

  thats why i told you

  whats the latest about gordon 
they are calling the noon edition
now lets go out and get a paper
outside of the building the news-
boys were hurrying up the street with
the latest issue of the papers gard-
ner who had been detained came out
at that moment and joined allen who
had been waiting at the steps for him
so it happened that the little group of
four stood near together waiting for
the papers and baring took advantage
of the nearness to scrutinize allen
closely

  he doesnt look at all like that man
when you see him near by he mur-
mured in an undertone to clio who
listened without a smile she even
looked appraisingly at allen herself

  then the boy in the lead reached
them with the papers and all four of
them caught sight of the headline

digging up new stories

xhile some of the biggest brains in the united states are at the head of
the moving-picture business it occasionally happens as is frequently the
case with every business that develops with phenomenal rapidity that totally
incompetent men are put into places of great responsibility one such man
an official of a well-known producing company in new york was lamenting to
a dramatic press agent that his concern could not find enough stories to supply
material for all its actors and directors

     oh said the dramatic man theres a lot of stuff available for the movies
if you people will only take the trouble to dig it up

    tell me whats in your mind said the movie man eagerly tell me
where it is ill get it

     in that case replied the other why dont you get hold of some of vol-
taire or racine or-

    wait wait commanded the movie magnate with a great deal of

author of men of iron the melting pot of the islands etc

  the problem of this football player was what to do about the orders of
the coach when they were palpably wrong discipline is an important
factor in the winning of a big game but there have been instances where
the mutineer has pulled off the play that spelled victory

the vicious boom of the pigskins
as they spiraled downfield
smote on the ears of the or-
anges side-line experts with a
significance that the season had so far
lacked there was a harder drive to
the sprints of the back-field men who
captured the twisting ovals at the end
of their flight scattered here and
there in small squads the big forwards
were blocking and charging feinting
and thrusting with a restrained ferocity
that won curt commendation from their
coaches the wide-flung activities syn-
chronized at a sharp call into signal
drill for the varsity and scrub squads
and a keen observer would have marked
a more compelling bark to the signals
of the quarter backs and a smoother
dash a more cohesive blending of plays
as the squads drummed up and down
the field it was in the air this feel-
ing that the turning point of the sea-
sons drudgery had come

  three days before the lightly held
purple had come down from her new
england aerie and only a sixty-yard
run by templeton from a fumble had
offset the purples dazzling attack and
partially redeemed the listless work of
the orange machine three more days
of november and the dough green

team never so formidable as in its an-
nual clash with the orange would put
to the supreme test the team that had
not yet found itself the break of
the season had come but only the con-
firmed partisan undergraduate could
crown his vision with the laurel of a
successful season a defeat by the
green a few more recruits for the hos-
pital squad and the orange coaches
would face a herculean task to break
even with the ancient rivals who
sported the crimson and the blue in
footballs tourney

  the head coach threw up his hand
and the weaving evolutions halted
line up for scrimmage the order
snapped and the weather-beaten stands
hurled it back in raucous echoes
scrubs ball on the varsity twenty-five-
yard line first down  now-he
paused to fill his lungs and then yelled
with dynamic energy that poised the
rival lines on their toes-tear em up
varsity  get-that-ball

  the scrub quarter knees flexed
faced his back field the smile left his
frank engaging face he glared at
them with a concentrated fury that
changed it into the living counterfeit
of a chinese devil mask he hammered
the air with short choppy punches of
the mutineer



his clenched fists and the scrub went
taut from wing to wing as he bit off
the signals in vibrant compelling num-
bers the lines locked in an upthrust-
ing lunge the scrubs just a shade the
quicker a back shot through tackle
for a plunge that carried him clear for
a six-yard gain again the quarter in-
fused the despised scrubs with a fight-
ing elan that bent back the opposing
line behind the regulars the head
coach knifed his way from flank to
flank storming deriding pleading in
ceaseless objurgation the  other
coaches followed suit lashing with ver-
bal taunts shouting to their respective
charges advice that broke in angry fal-
settos buf the fury of the assault
was not checked until the scrub quar-
ter had carried the ball over the goal
line on an elusive slice just off tackle

  varsitys ball on her thirty-yard
line now show something show
something pleaded the head coach
again the lines surged in a deadlock
split in the center and the varsity full
back smashed through for a first down
the scrub quarter raced back and forth
slapping the backs of his crouched line
the following play found no vulnerable
point taunts and gibes threats and
jeers added nothing to the varsitys
tries at the line an end run netted fif-
teen yards before the secondary defense
hauled down the varsitys captain and
then as the scrub defense stiffened
from wing to wing the full back
dropped back for a punt it was
blocked and a scrub end fell on it
again the quarter lashed his men into
a frenzy of attack a whirlwind of
pounding smashes and stilettolike
drives that beat back the dogged var-
sity

  here you scrub quarter whats
your name lance eh know the
varsity signals jump in there and see
if you can whip some life into this
bunch of cripples

  jeffrey lance could no more have re-
a

pressed the elation in his eyes or the
smile that twisted his straight mouth
than he could have slowed up the sud-
den pulsebeats that the words had
spurred for a year he had waited for
that call a plethora of stars in the
back field and the damning evidence
of the scale beam in the training house
had conspired against him since fresh-
man year he had worked his way to
europe and back on a cattle ship in
the summer and had reported back for
the first day of practice hard as a
wrought-iron nail and tipping the beam
for the first time over the hundred-and-
fifty-pound mark graduation had
stripped the back field of half its regu-
lars but templeton substitute quarter
and burnham the ex-freshman star
were slated by the college to fight it out
for the pivotal berth

  lances knees soaked by the train-
ers big sponge flexed behind the line
and his cleats bit intoxhe turf a
quick survey of the line an intuitive
decision and to the savage chop of his
fists he rasped out his signal in that
driving bark that infused the weaken-
ing line with a new strength pound-
ing away at the tackles and guards
fighting his way past the flanks with
his own knifelike sallies shooting a
dazzling pass downfield at an unex-
pected stage he turned the tide of bat-
tle until it flowed strong over the
steaming lines of jerseys he saw the
goal posts foreshorten the head
coach with the light of the discoverer
of an unknown territory in his eyes
threw an arm about his shoulders and
shouted something in his ear the
cries of the coaches the individual ex-
hortations of the fight-maddened play-
ers sounded dim in his ears he
needed every ounce of his faculties to
crown the whirlwind march with a
score now that the scrubs secondary
defense was close to the line two
plays back he had caught the distress
in the face of the scrubs left tackle

  eighteen-twelve-sixteen-eight
signal boomed the head coach
eighteen-twelve-sixteen-eight
the ball shot from center and he
slammed it into the cupped arms of his
left half through the right side
crashed a mass on tackle and the left
halfs plunge landed the ball on the
one-yard line the head coach rushed
up with his face distorted with rage

  here you young idiot didnt you
hear me call signal you know what
that means all right then why in
blazes did you repeat it i told you
to shoot a pass over the line as soon as
you got inside the ten-yard mark

  i know and the quiet smile made
the head coach throw up his hands in
mock despair and i could see that
simpkins was all in at left tackle and
so i sent it at him

  the arms dropped and then the jaw
of the stupefied coach

  oh you did he sneered i sup-
pose you were playing football when
i was in short trousers a helluva
quarter youd be in a real game you
can go back to the scrub and stay
there-his voice rose in a helpless
splutter-yes stay there you muti-
nous bull-headed-

  lance dropped back as though the
infuriated head coach had struck him
in the mouth his chin tilted up an
inch or so and then he stood immo-
bile his face white for all the tan of
the summer his fists had clenched
spasmodically as the unforgetable al-
literative epithet rolled out at the cli-
max of the tirade his blazing eyes
held the others in a cold scorn defiant

truculent then without a word he

     

turned in the direction of the training
house some one barred his path and
he was face to face with the trainer
jerry craig there was a mute appeal
in the old chaps eyes a wireless of
sympathy and lance turned short
passed around the flank of the line and
took his place back of the scrub

  templeton raced out from the side
lines caught a whispered admonition
from the head coach and shouted his
signals while his head was nodding in
understanding and in back of a line
whose faces showed their resentment
of the scene lance beat their backs
with his open palms and there was a
quaver in his appeal hold them
scrub tear em up you old dogs
that spelled breakers ahead before the
varsity should batter its way across
that yard of turf like a wall of con-
crete it - held against the three assaults
that templeton well schooled in fidel-
ity to instructions launched against
simpkins

  all over three times around the
track growled the head coach lance
bent over with two of his mates to
help the prostrate half-hysterical
simpkins to his feet

 oh you billy simpkins he
crooned that was the gamest fight

i	ever saw on the old field thats the
stuff that will lick the blue billy i
could kiss you if you were strong
enough to stand it

  cut it out jeff mumbled the
abashed tackle this mans outfit isnt
going to lick the blue or even the
green until it knows a fighting quarter
and not a megaphone when they see
one you could make a grasshopper
out of an egyptian scarab and that
mucker of a head coach fellows as
the scrub gathered about them in a
close circle apologizes to lance here
or theyll have to get a new scrub does
that go

  no billy lance cut in i dont
want an apology what is an apology
from a mucker ill get him man to
man the day we break training well
stick and well show the varsity some
football are you with me

  the combined effects of jeffrey
lances counsel the invigorating
douche of the showers and the sooth-
ing oils of the scrub rubbers
the mutineer



kneaded into aching sinews quelled the
incipient mutiny but there was treas-
ured up a smoldering resentment of the
head coachs methods and a dogged
ambition to show up the varsity the
leading spirits of the scrub gathered at
lances room that night to pour out
afresh the vials of their discontent
the process was at flood tide when
jerry craig dropped in jerry was
regarded by both varsity and scrub with
a confidence that would have amazed
the coaching staff had it known its
depth with a sound strategy and the
inborn faculty of gauging a teams sa-
lient strength and frailties he had also
developed to the same uncanny point
the trick of turning up latent brilliancy
that the lynx-eyed coaches often over-
looked that evening he had divined
the need of an older head and a sym-
pathetic mentor to stem the insubordi-
nate tide in the oranges ranks he
listened in patient silence to the sting
ing comment that crackled from group
to group and to himself admitted the
justice of its basis confident in the
assurance that jerry would betray no
verbal outbreaks the comment was un-
sparing and bitter he cupped his
hands about the match that flared over
the bowl of his pipe and drew the
smoke into his lungs before he cut
in with the longest speech that he had
delivered within the decade

  the one long cry in college boys
he began in a quiet voice that stilled
the tumult from the first day of prac-
tice to the last day of the season is we
must beat the blue very well its
up to you boys to help make that threat
good the team hasnt found itself but

i	never saw a better lot of material
his hard blue eyes shone in the shift-
ing lights like blazing gems the lines
of his keen lean face were vivid with
the same inner fire play the game
you did to-day with lance leading the
attack and stiffening up the defense
and when the time comes the varsity

will have caught the contagion of it
just as sure as god made little apples
and then-his voice went soft but
thrilled with its conviction-if the
varsity can have lance in its line-up
we will beat the blue this goes no
further boys i never talked to you
like this before but theres been too
much reliance on the side-line dope too
much loading a quarter from his head
guard to his cleats with orders weve
got to have a quarter big enough to take
the helm in his own hands and not wait
for the pilot to come aboard with his
chart weve got to have one wholl
drive the varsity straight through the
blue breakers ahead when defeat is
staring at him straight ahead and be-
tween the goal posts rally behind
lance and mark my words hell be
out on that field before the blue game is
over and every ounce that you give
him until then will come back in a ton
of fight

  he left behind him a silence that
they were slow to break one by one
with muttered so long fellows they
took their leave lance his head sunk
between his hands clenched his fists
and shook them at the open fire ill
stand it for old jerry he breathed

but afterward- a grim smile

took the place of the unuttered thought

  the green in a driving rain played
the varsity to a standstill with a wet
ball and a treacherous footing the game
resolved into a test of fundamentals
and well-laid plans of strategy went by
the board the green better grounded
in fundamentals was weak in her sub-
stitutes  and the orange feeding them
into the firing line with prodigal hand
was able to stem the marches of the
mountaineers when they threatened de-
feat

  the week intervening before the
crimson battle found the vanguard of
old varsity stars rallying to the field
in answer to the all of distress
schooled in conflicting systems that


the popular magazine

had marked the progress of two dec-
ades they harried the linesmen with
new pointers on defense backs whose
names had crackled to fame at the end
of the long rocket cheer drove the back
field to savage despair by the same tac-
tics the old fatuous system bred a
feeling of insecurity that bordered on
panic the head coach drew on secret
reservoirs of sarcasm and invective and
the varsity played with a sullen cheer-
less endeavor that drove him to con-
fide to his corps of helpers

  these fellows dont play for the fun
of it the way we did blast me if they
dont seem to hate football whats
wrong with the college  wheres the
old spirit  theyve got about as much
pep as a man sentenced to jail for
life

  that week lance drove the scrub
against the varsity in three grueling
scrimmages with a fury that counter-
balanced superior weight and class
they scored for him with a frequency
that sent the news to the crimson camp
that the orange defense is shot to
pieces the last hard practice was
held on thursday and that night lance
and simpkins were in the big squad
that left for the north burnham the
sophomore quarter who had crowded
templeton for his berth had pulled a
tendon in the last five minutes of play
and simpkins who had outwitted the
first-string tackle substitutes on attack
and defense was sorely needed to bol-
ster up the line

  wrapped in his blanket on the side
lines lance was oblivious to the color
and pulsing life of the crimson sta-
dium he was following plays with an
eye that was searching for flaws in the
crimsons heralded defense uncon-
sciously his lips moved to the signals
a shade before templetons call rang
across field a hollow feeling gripped
him in the pit of his stomach as the
crimsons defense outwitted the inane
convention of templetons strategy

but templeton he admitted in all fair-
ness had been drilled until letter per-
fect in the plays for midfield the plays
inside the twenty-yard line the plays
to use on certain downs after certain
games his was the strategy manufac-
tured for weeks ahead it had no al-
ternative for the quick shifting crises
of a big game save for an ear always
attuned for the bits of advice that drib-
bled out from the side lines with each
substitution

  the first half to the uninitiated
ended with the crimson but a shade
the better team lance knew that the
crimson quarter was trying out the
orange line from wing to wing show-
ing nothing to the blue scouts until the
time should come in the third quarter
the crimson leader unleashed a blind-
ing feinting thrusting resiliency of
attack that tore great gaps in the or-
ange line the last quarter found the
orange striving with the desperation
of a beaten team to cross the unsullied
crimson goal the long punts of the
crimsons great kicker offset it all with
drives that crowded the orange jerseys
always back toward their goal posts
twice lance caught the eye of the
head coach resting on him in unsettled
decision but the crimson game ended
and the varsity letter was still denied
him

  there were times in the short week
following the teams return when the
varsity goaded to fury by memories of
those crimson touchdowns and goals
from the field iossed the battling scrub
about as the crimson had humbled it
only to lapse back into indifferent play
near the close of the final scrimmage
lance jumped out at the sharp call of
the head coaeh the varsity answered
to his hand on the helm with a fire and
snap and a machinelike drive that sent
the undergraduate body into a delirium
of hope that the team had found itself
on the eve of its greatest battle

  signal practice on the final day how-
the mutineer



ever found templeton the head coachs
choice lance will be ripe in another
season he had told the advisory board
templeton has the steadiness for a big
game hell carry out orders to the last
word

  the blue scored in the first quarter
of that memorable game on a daring
pass lance groaned as he saw the
orange ends drawn completely in and
the secondary defense smothered while
the ball shot across the goal line for
the touchdown then the blue took a
leaf out of the book that had served
the crimson so well the blond-headed
full back sent the ball booming over
the white lines for a mighty drive of
fifty-five yards templeton called for
a punt after a try that showed the blue
line adamant again the blond giant
swung his kicking foot to the level of
his head and when the teams lined up
the pigskin lay ten yards nearer the
orange goal lance groaned again
as the orange backs massed once for a
futile attack and templeton called for
a kick

  wheres the fight in that back
field he wailed to billy simpkins
why doesnt he smash away at them
or take a chance on a pass even if the
play is in our territory  look at that
blue secondary defense billy theyre
no more looking for a forward pass
than a blizzard

  orders grunted billy smash
once and then kick keep it up until
some accident of the game gives us
the ball down in their territory dont
we all know it by heart they know
it on the blue team just as well as we
do why should they worry

  another exchange of punts a fif-
teen-yard return a vicious drive at the
oranges left flank and the blue full
back dropped ten yards behind his
crouching line with an ease that
started a wave of despair rolling from
end to end of the orange stands on the
west and converted the blue stands on

the east into a maelstrom of hysterical
joy he shot the ball over the bar with
a force that carried it far up in the
south stand

 nine to nothing lance said
quietly and we havent shown a thing
outkicked outplayed on the defense
and the game young

  yes and outgeneraled growled the
substitute tackle

  lance grinned in spite of the gloom
that hung like a cloud over the orange
side line in billy simpkins simple
soul he knew his generalship was en-
shrined as a sacred thing

  the blue quarter shot another daz-
zling pass two minutes after the second
quarter began this time to one of his
ends the receiver unhurried and de-
liberate to an extent that incited cries
of protest from the blue stands
stopped dead in his tracks as the orange
tacklers swarmed about him then his
arm swung like a scythe and the ball
spiraled on its axis in a yellow streak
across field to a waiting tackle carey
the swiftest back on the field hauled
down the fleeing receiver on the or-
anges fifteen-yard line the orange
stands were up in a frenzied cheer for
carey and the cheer leaders gathered
their energies into a long cheer that
hurled defiance at their equally jubilant
rivals again the masterful toe of the
blond giant sent the ball hurtling end
over end for a goal that offered little
test for his supreme skill

  we need two touchdowns to tie
was lances grim comment

  yes and a fat chance retorted
simpkins watch us do it again-a
try at the line a kick and that big
whale outpunting us ten yards to a
clip

  theres only one way to do it
ventured lance and thats to rush it
rush it dont let them have a smell
at it

  unconsciously his clenched fists
were beating a tattoo on his knees and


the povular magazine

his voice rose above the sullen hum of
the sweatered substitutes on the low
benches the head coach looked
sharply around

  up and down the field the ball shut-
tled weaving from full back to a wait-
ing back another dull boom and a
blue back would take the swirling pig-
skin on the run elude a flying tackle
measure his length on the turf and
turn the ball over with a happy grin
to the chunky blue center another
thud and the blue ends racing with
heads cocked over shoulder to watch
the flight would convoy the fifty-five-
yard punt downfield

  they havent shown what they can
do if they start to run the ball billy
simpkins shouted against the storm of
cheers that followed the teams off field
at the end of the half

  they dont have to yelled lance
in his ear may keep it under cover
with the crimson scouts out in force
you know what they did to the brown
last saturday when they had to

  the head coach read the riot act be-
tween halves revising it with words
that scorched and seared lance saw
hathaway the varsity captain lift tor-
tured eyes to the lines of jerseys and
moleskins that ranged down the center
of the room their looks met and
lance flashed back a brave smile that
relaxed the tortured lines into a faint
smile he waited at the steps as the
varsity filed out and caught hatha-
ways arm

  you can do it cap he urged
their ends are playing too wide
drive some plays off tackle and cut
out the kicking game rush the ball
cap rush it

  hathaway gulped as though the hard
words of the head coach had fastened
their humiliation on his throat muscles
weve got our orders jeff he mum-
bled thickly wrere not to rush it
until we cross midfield

  the blue quarter chose to cut loose

his attack on the first scrimmage of
the half-a powerful versatile attack
its power shattered the disintegrating
defense the staffs of the linesmen
dipped like lances at rest and moved
downfield to a march of first downs that
threw the blue supporters into a de-
lirium of ecstasy there was no stop-
ping that relentless machinelike drive
the full-throated cheers of triumph
swelled out in a volume that drowned
the high-pitched pleadings  of the
orange legions to hold them orange
hold them

  the march ended in a touchdown in
the far corner of the field and when
the blond full back missed the difficult
try for goal the blue accepted the
loss of the point with a good humor
that drove home deeper the iron of
impending defeat

  seventeen to nothing lamented
simpkins its all over jeff but the
post-mortems

  why dont they throw the dope
overboard and fight fight fight
lance stormed back

  the blue rushed in a covey of sub-
stitutes-clean-limbed muscular ar-
dent athletes-and their impetuous spur
started the shuttling pounding advance
afresh there was a brief check a re-
trieved fumble and the blue full back
lifted the ball close to the orange goal
line templeton caught it and for the
first time was loose on one of the
side-stepping elusive sprints that had
featured his early-season form he
flashed past tackier after tackier
squirming twisting wheeling but al-
ways going ahead hathaway was con-
voying him and when a smashing tac-
kle tore his feet from under him on
the thirty-yard line forty thousand for-
got their partisanship in a roaring trib-
ute he lay inert as the blue jerseys
disentangled themselves from the heap
two of his men lifted him to his feet
and a wave of relief swept the orange
benches as he started back to his place
the mutineer



shouting the signal for the next play
then as the line sank into position
he crumpled in a heap on the turf

  knees gone back on him again
was lances quiet verdict and he felt
his heart racing jerry craig dashed
out on the field and the head coach
caught his shoulder as he returned

  knees twisted lance heard him
say but i can patch him up for the
last quarter the head coach nodded
glumly and turned to the benches

  out with you lance he snapped
you know the dope

  but as lance tore across the field his
plan of attack was clear to him he
slapped the referee on the back with
a heavy hand and the blue thousands
broke into carefree laughter as the
sandy-haired official winced his first
signal crackled out like a string of
giant firecrackers a back shot off
tackle for a plunge that carried him to
the thirty-seven-yard line another
and the full back plowed through cen-
ter for the first down that the orange
had registered by straight rushing the
linesmen pulled up their stakes with
seeming reluctance and the blue quar-
ter jaughed and playfully slapped the
backs of his center men on the next
play the orange back field went cata-
pulting at the same point but lance
was clear of tackle sprinting with a
fury that carried him clear of all but
the full back again the linesmen
moved their stakes and the orange
legions lifted up a mighty cheer

  a substitute came sprinting across
field tapped the referees shirt sleeve
and whispered in lances ear

  no no he shouted back get
in the line and play the game

  in seven more plays his fists peril-
ously near the faces of his backs he
pounded out cabalistic numbers that
had no place in the head coachs cam-
paign and drove the regenerated var-
sity over the blues line  hathaway
kicked an easy goal

  carey was downed on the kick-off
without gain but lance shot him out-
side tackle on the next play for an
eight-yard gain seventy yards away
lay the blue goal another score and
the big lead would no longer be an in-
surmountable handicap from close
formation he signaled for a wide pass
the daring of the maneuver caught the
blue flat-footed and the oranges left
end threaded his way down the orange
side lines for a gain of thirty yards
the whistle shrilled for the end of the
quarter and lance saw templeton
throw off his sweater and limp out to
the side line of all plays in the orange
gamut lance knew that a forward
pass in the orange territory was an-
athema and taboo he wheeled and
caught hathaway by the arm

  do i run this team or not cap
he snapped his ultimatum

  hathaway caught the glow of battle
in is eyes and drew a sleeve of his
jersey across his grime-streaked face

  you do go to it jeff he snapped
back

from the blue side lines the regu-
lars poured back to stem the oranges
crazy tide the battered orange line
now threaded with substitutes caught
the reenforced blue line on the charge
bent it back and opened a lane for
carey another slice at tackle and
lance was free one sleeve of his
jersey was gone and the bare arm
flashed out like a piston rod and caught
the diving tacklers off balance with
his stiff arm checking their lunges and
his feet weaving in zigzag trails hi
was headed straight for the goal gain-
ing speed at every stride the old
field rocked to the avalanche that
poured down from the orange bul-
warks on the side line orange sweat-
ers were waving cheer leaders were
spurring on their sections and old stars
were dancing throwing their arms
about each other in the abandon of the

realization that the despised team had
come back in a mighty rally

  the guardian of the blue goal posts
sprawled at full length on the turf his
outstretched fingers clutching in vain
at the flying quarter hathaway
kicked the goal in a silence that told
of the significant tension that had set-
tled now on the warring legions

  again the blue lined up for the kick-
off one more touchdown by the amaz-
ing team that the unknown quarter
back with the torn jersey was lashing
to great deeds and defeat would be
changed into a glorious victory up
in the somber blue stand an old grad
roared in a voice husky with emotion
touchdown blue the cry went
racing down the stands and the orange
shot it back in truculent defiance
lance was under the kick-off and his
cloud of interferers swept down the
field like a sotnia of cossacks the
blue regulars still cold from their
wait on the side lines through the third
quarter were caught flat-footed by a
tandem split a substitute tore out
from the blue benches to supplant the
outwitted left end lance grinned sar-
donically as he saw the flanks close in
he shot another wide pass from close
formation and hathaway fought with
it to the forty-yard line a blue tackle
sifted through on the next play and
downed carey for a loss lance tapped
the orange tackle on the arm youve
played yourself off your feet tommy
old boy he said tell simpkins i
want him and if they try to stop him
tell him to come in spite of hell and
high water

  the tackle shuffled off heartbroken
and his name crackled out thrice as he
dove under his blanket to hide the tears
simpkins full of fight as a hungry
bear opened up a gap through which
hathaway retrieved the lost distance
lance gave the next signal with a de-
termination that bit through jerseys
and moleskins like a vial of acid the

  line ahead of him went taut as a strand
of wire the big blue line buckled
broke and carey knifed through for a
first down

  in the stands organized cheering had
gone by the boards cheer leaders
were swaying from side to side like
madmen tumbling to the turf like over-
wrought dervishes and the torrent of
noise came out to the playing field in
a crazy discordant volume lance
deaf to its tumult could hear only the
panting of the blue forwards could
see that the face of the blue quarter
had gone drawn and haggard there
was no answering mercy in the call that
rolled out for the fight-maddened
orange the timekeeper had raced out
and shouted three minutes of
play

 like madmen who yet had every
faculty under control his line answered
that signal it lunged forward in a
close-welded wall split at left guard
and through the breach an orange back
stormed for a first down lance picked
him up and for weeks afterward he
could picture the creases in the run-
ners neck lined with the grime of bat-
tle his roving eye caught the blues
right end edging wide again but he
hurled hathaway into the line

  now orange he yelled the elec-
tric tone of that vibrant call steeled
them for a supreme assault into cen-
ter the big full back smashed the lines
surged like charging breakers meeting
and lance was off with the keenness
of a rapier thrust the blues quarter
met him head on and stopped him just
inside the ten-yard line another feint
at the low-crouched blue line now
fighting with the desperation of devils
the desperate unyielding shock of
giants and from behind the line lance
shot a pass to carey it danced for
an instant on his upthrust finger tips
as he flashed over the goal line and
the blue quarter leaped like a hound
for the loose ball
the mutineer



  they went down together with a
crash and carey turned his face side-
ways with a blissful grin that told
lance the ball was safe beneath his
jersey

  the score was tied hathaway
while the bedlam rose and fell only
to soar to crazier heights measured
his kick with the aplomb of a gunner
laying his piece for a telling shot his
foot swung back in a lazy arc the
blue line swept forward the foot bit
sharp into the base of the ball in
lances cupped hand and soared to
victory for the orange in a curve of
flashing yellow

  outside the training house the jubi-
lant orange cohorts massed for a vol-
ley of cheers

  they broke into a room around
which the varsity squad was ranged in
an impenetrable double rank and the
strange silence was broken by lances
vibrant refusal to take the outstretched
hand of the head coach

  no not on your life you low
hound ill shake hands with no man
who called me the name you did the
day you threw me back into the scrub
i kept in the game only to help out
the varsity not you and ive waited
for this day with but one thought be-
yond that well we beat the blue
and now put up your hands you cow-
ard 

  one of the old stars tried to break
through with a sharp remonstrance but
simpkins pushed him back you keep
out of this growled simpkins

  the head coach looked lance full
in the face and then turned slowly
so that his blazing eyes took in the
whole squad he tore off his coat
tossed it to one of them and faced
lance

  you havent a chance with me
lance ive got thirty pounds on you
and youve just finished the hardest
game the old field has ever seen but
youve called me a hound and a cow-

ard and if it will clear the air im
game come on 

  it was a hard short fight with blows
that landed with the impact of sledge
smashes blows that each took unflinch-
ing the head coachs mouth dripped
with blood where one of lances chop-
ping fists had caught him above the
silence of the room their breathing
came hard and fast the head coach
stepped back with the agility of a pan-
ther his right shot for lances stom-
ach as he followed and as lances
guard dropped to block it the left
smote lance full on the point of his
jaw it sent him reeling over a bench
and there he lay inert one of the
old stars broke through the relaxed
lines and his stern words quelled the
angry mutterings

  not a - word of this outside he
commanded get lance up and then
get dressed and out of here

  lance stirred before they could
carry out the orders and he was smil-
ing with lips twisted in pain when he
found his feet unsteadily

  were quits he said and put out
his hand the head coach caught it
in a grip that recked little of the twisted
lips you were in the right jeff
lance he said quietly right from
the start if you can forget it id
like to come back next fall and work
with you well trim the blue before
they ever get started do you want
me 

  i ive got nothing to do with it
lance stammered

  yes youve got everything to do
with it the words rushed from the
head coach heedless of the thin red
trickle youre going to captain the
team next fall or i dont know the
old orange spirit that we old chaps
thought was dead do you want me

  lances quick yes was lost in the
roar of welcome that the varsity sent
up for the new captain and head coach
of the orange
the undiscovered continent

recently in several of the great eastern states the question of votes
for women was voted on and it was decided that for the present women
were not to vote in the big dense centers of population this is by no
means a defeat for those women who want the vote the fact that the
question became an election issue of interest instead of a joke in such states as
new jersey new york and pennsylvania is an indubitable sign of a rising tide
how far it will rise no one can say but it is surely coming in it is really already
too late to argue for or against the nucleus of the average political organization
--which is patronage-is lacking to those who want votes for women and yet
their strength is growing it is unlikely that there is anything artificial or
spasmodic about such a growth more probably it is the outward expression
of a new idea which is growing in the mind and soul of our democracy is
it a good idea or a bad with all due respect to those who argue pro and con
we think that no one knows the surest ground upon which to stand is that
the idea seems to be an expansion of the democratic ideal which gives the vote
to as many people as possible but will the women turn out to be conserva-
tives or radicals will they vote with the men or against whats the differ-
ence between a man and a woman as a voter anyway no one knows because
it hasnt been tried enough yet but its anybodys guess what do you think

the uses of adversity

wonderful are the benefits of adversity not many years ago the
south raised bumper crop after bumper crop of cotton and the price
of the staple fell to so low a figure that it did not cover the cost of
production the south faced ruin or thought so cotton had been
its one stand-by its money crop and the world had more cotton than the mills
could spin when the situation seemed utterly hopeless a demand for cotton
came from unthought-of quarters its cheapness forced it upon the attention
of manufacturers who never before had considered cotton possible to-day
cotton is used in hundreds of industries it didnt know before its days of
caught in thb net



adversity nothingin all the history of king cotton was better for the cotton
planter than those years of depression in the late nineties

    so too with gas it is one hundred years since gas came into use a
quarter of a century ago the advent of electricity seemed to mark its doom
for ten years its position was perilous to-day its use is many times greater
than before electricity was introduced adversity forced its makers to find
new fields for its use it has made a sphere for itself in the realm of heating
and in the minor lines of power

    the household use of gas not only for cooking but for laundry work
supplying hot water for the bath and dozens of domestic needs auxiliary house
heating et cetera has expanded enormously there are to-day few city-dwelling
families-whether wealthy well-to-do of moderate means or poor-that do
not cook their meals with gas the modern housewife considers her gas range
her most dependable servant so too gas has been employed for cooking in
hotels restaurants lunch rooms hospitals clubs and public and private institu-
tions where large numbers of persons are fed daily its greatest use however
promises to be in the field of manufacturing

    there are a thousand different ways in which it is utilized in the industries
its activities run all the way from turning out heavy metal work building an
automobile and helping to print a daily newspaper to drying a photograph plate
curling a feather for a womans hat and fashioning the delicate point of a
fountain pen

    in the manufacture of clothing in which new york city with an annual
output of three hundred million dollars leads the world there is scarcely an
important process of any kind that is not dependent upon gas not only is
it used for steaming cleaning and pressing but for shrinking dyeing singeing
spraying crimping plaiting stamping and so on

    with ingenious appliances wood is dried and bent flavorings and sirups are
made silver is embossed and plated and a hundred and one other interesting
industrial processes are accomplished by means of gas stained glass is bent
into the most delicate shapes thermometers are made automobile tires are
heated and adjusted eggs are candled grain is dried butter is renovated motor-
car bodies are baked coffee is roasted aeroplane and automobile radiators are
put together liquids are pasteurized cravats are ironed china is fired bank
notes are restored to their original cleanliness ice-cream cones are produced in
enormous quantities candy of all sorts and kinds is manufactured by the ton
sugar is refined meats are smoked and boiled engagement rings are fashioned
fruits are preserved false teeth are contrived and so on ad infinitum

    the examples of cotton and of gas carry a lesson to men what seems to
be adversity not infrequently is a blessing in disguise it makes us rise to
higher things

a peanut paradise

gambia enjoys the distinction not only of being great britains smallest
colony in africa but of being the richest there are other colonies rich
in gold rich in diamonds rich in rubber and in copper but in comparison
with little-known gambia they are poor the peanut-the goober as
the people of our southern states call it-has made gambia so wealthy that of
all the colonies or the governments of africa it alone owes not a penny in


the cpocpulacr magazine

fact it has one million dollars in its treasury compared with other parts of
equatorial africa it is a paradisefor its public roads are good and wonder of
wonders it has a twejitieth-century water system with filtration plant water
mains hydrants along the streets of bathurst pipes in the houses and a foun-
tain in the city square

    in all gambia there are less people than in worcester massachusetts the
colony is but two narrow strips of territory along the river from which it takes
its name with senegal on three sides and the atlantic ocean on the other
nowhere in the world does the peanut grow so abundantly and so well outside
of bathurst the capital perhaps ninety per cent of the inhabitants raise peanuts
to gather the crop is a great undertaking-how great may be appreciated from the
fact that the peanuts exported average nearly seventy thousand tons a year and
that means one thousand pounds of peanuts for every man woman and child in
the land this one crop brings an average of more than three million dollars
a year to this little colony and as a general thing the imports do not exceed
two and a quarter million dollars so that each year gambia adds to its wealth
and its comforts these comforts are not elaborate for the native has not been
spoiled thus far he has a longing for gayly colored calicoes and plug hats but
is not foolish in that respect he likes rum too but is not inclined to be intem-
perate sugar and tobacco he craves and their uses are broadening constantly
aside from cotton goods the principal items of imports are hardware and
rice the hardware is made up almost entirely of the three-legged iron pot of
familiar memory everything is cooked in the three-legged pot and all mem-
bers of the household explore its depths for whatever may appeal to the individual
taste	

    life has few problems for the senegambians they need few clothes and
fashions rarely change the great river yields an abundance of fish and the
peanut brings them more money than they require for all their needs every day
is a holiday except the time of planting and gathering the crop

    but peril awaits them the automobile has discovered their paradise and
the chug of the motor is heard along the riverroads worse than that the intro-
duction of the water system has led some of the residents of bathurst to put
in bathtubs soap is looming up among the articles of import they are rich
to-day but waterworks and bathtubs mean plumbers supplies and plumbers
the chauffeur and the plumber may bring woe to gambia

railroad investments

when the argentine republic floated a loan in new york recently the
norfolk  western railway was one of the subscribers it may seem
odd for a north american transportation company to be lending money
to a south american government but the fact is that a lot of railroad
money goes into short-time notes and gilt-edge bonds it is better so invested
than to remain idle in banks

    to show how widely a railroad distributes its investments and what a variety
of securities it picks up this same norfolk  western may serve as an example
in addition to participation to the extent of  in the argentine loan it
holds  of the bonds of newark n j  of the bonds and

     fighting on the diamond belt

diamonds are not so much in demand as they used to be-at least there
has been a slump in sales since the war began but they are still highly
regarded i south africa however they are as common as dirt

           two squadrons of british troops literally walked on diamonds for
a week during a trek that they made recently in southwest africa at every halt
the soldiers sought for precious stones and many really valuable gems were
picked up one trooper who knew diamonds in the rough garnered seventy-five
in the course of the march

    the region that was traversed-and which has been the scene of some
fighting of which only faint echoes have reached us here-is one of the largest
diamond belts in the world it is desolate in the extreme-a desert of rocks and
sand where the sun beats pitilessly and the wind comes in gusts like blasts from
an open furnace yet there are many mines there-mostly primitive workings
to win the gems from the gaunt soil is an incessant battle with the forces of
nature it is a land where rain never falls the diamonds are obtained only
through sifting endlessly the dry-as-ashes earth

ivthe beazleys

life when you have lived in the
world for a good many years
is a most extraordinary spectacle
to look back upon if you have
vision and a certain amount of philos-
ophy you will see men who were
tottering twenty years ago firm and
successful to-day you will see to-day
wrecks that twenty years ago were men
of promise and if you have knowledge
as well as vision and philosophy you
will know that the three things that
affect men most deeply for good or ill
are circumstance a woman or a child

  the story of many a mans success
is simply the story of a tug of war
between a woman and drink the man
being the rope and the power of a
child who can appraise it  circum-
stance is a different matter it is the
great voipe tfrat envelopes and contends
with all of us and it is never more
dangerous than when it appears under
the guise of success

  one blue and gold morning while
the palm trees were bending to the
warm trade wind and the pacific
creaming against the outer reef filled
the air with its slumber song a topsail
schooner of some ninety tons and with
the name tamalpais painted in fair
white letters on her counter passed
through the reef opening and came to
anchor opposite the beach of nen-
kohee

  a new arrival was always an event
at nenkohee and scarcely had the rum-

ble tumble of the anchor chain-ceased
echoirf from the woods and cliffs than
the beach became alive from the
pretty little town bowered and half
hidden by pandanus and coconut
groves idlers began to trickle down the
waterside natives stood on the blazing
white sands shading their eyes the in-
evitable beach comber scratching him-
self awake sat up to smoke and criti-
cize the newcomers whoever they
might be while from the mole-half
mole half boat slip-the port officer
put off in a big white scow

  beazley the new trader who had
come to live-at nenkohee stood on the
deck of the tamalpais watching all
this wondering at the beauty of the
place and talking to the captain

  beazley was a nice-looking young
fellow of about twenty-eight his wife
down below getting things together for
landing was a woman slightly older
than he a little woman with brown
eyes a practical but kindly disposition
and endowed with the most valuable
dot that woman ever brought to hus-
band-plenty of common sense

  it was a love match and this was
their first great venture in life all their
money was in the trade on board the
tamalpais and all their hopes beaz-
ley had bought the good will of a trad-
ing station and he had the tamalpais
which belonged to his father or at
least the use of her for trading pur-
poses

this series-began in the popular magazine for november 
the luck of captain slocum



  thats macadam said the captain
of the tamalpais as the port officers
boat rowed toward them its four
years since ive been to this island but
i havent forgot him hes port officer
and doctor and all there aint no doc-
tor here good morning mr mac-
adam and hows yourself

  as macadam came on board mrs
beazley appeared from the saloon
hatch

  good morning said macadam
why its captain towler no cap

i havent forgot you thought i knew
the schooner too sort of sensed her
as she passed the reef but couldnt
clap a name on her

  this is mr beazley said towler
come to take up a tradin station-
and mrs beazley heres the lady just
come on deck

  macadam scraped up his best bow
glad to see you sir said he to
beazley but which trading station
have you come to take for theres only
one here and that belongs to captain
slocum

  ive got a letter of introduction to
him said beazley the station im
after belongs to mr will lewin or
belonged to him before he sold me the
good will of the place and the house
that was three months ago

  there was a hencoop fastened to the
port bulwark and macadam sat down
on it as though afflicted by some sud-
den weakness of the legs

  will lewin sold you a house here
and the good will of a trading station
said he three months ago why its
two and a half years since lewin left
this island he and sakers-pair of
scamps-and he had no house to sell
then only one he rented and as for
his trading station why theres none
youve been done sir

  oh george said mrs beazley
she was just going to say i told
you to beware of lewin but she
checked herself beazley flushed

  it is a hard thing for a man to be
told to his face that he has been done
harder still if his wife is present and
hardest of all under the conditions in
which beazley received the news

  for here he was in a strange place
at the end of a long voyage with all
his future prospects at stake and the
well-being of his wife

  beazley despite his pleasant appear-
ance was a fighting man there was
welsh blood in his veins and a spice
of ferocity derived from red-headed
heathen who had clubbed and stabbed
one another around the hills of mar-
gam in days long forgotten

  well he said it seems i am-
from what you say but the price i
paid for house and good will wasnt
much and it was worth it to bring us
to such a pretty place as this

  more than worth it said the plucky
little wife looking over the water at
ninea with a cold chill at her heart
perhaps it was the setback but it
seemed to her that all that beauty
was inimical to them yet not for a
moment was she daunted she had
american blood in her veins as well as
scotch and that combination is hard
to beat

  well said macadam its pretty
enough and healthy enough too and
that reminds me cap ive come to
inquire after your bill of health
youll find it clean enough said
the captain come on down below
and have a glass of somethin

  down they went and beazley tak-
ing his seat on the hencoop talked to
his wife

  you told me you didnt trust that
chap lewin said he well you
were right-and thats a comfort it
might have been worse too he didnt
chisel me out of much and as for
the house if we cant get one here ill
make a tent im going to carry this
thing through

  and you will said mrs beazley


the popular magazine

  they waited he seated on the hen-
coop and she leaning on the rail watch-
ing the brilliant shore and the happy-
looking little town that held their fate
and their chance of prosperity in this
world then the captain and mac-
adam appeared from below and mac-
adam who seemed to take a friendly
sort of interest in the deluded ones
offered to row them ashore in his boat

  it will be quicker than lowering one
of the ships boats said he and i can
put you up to things maybe and show
you the way to a man who may be able
to let you a house martell is his name
an old frenchman honest enough too
but a bit cantankerous

  he showed mrs beazley over the
side and followed with her husband
the rowers gave way and they ap-
proached the beach

  it was mrs beazleys first acquaint-
ance with the wonderland of the pacific
islands they had touched at no port
since leaving sydney and now as she
landed at the boat slip and walked on
to the white sand of the beach she for-
got lewin and macadam and all things
disagreeable and practical in the en-
chantment that suddenly seized her

  it was like walking into heaven
she could scarcely believe that all this
was real that everyday people worked
and lived here and made money here
and married and had children-and
died

  here on the beach the slight tang
of sea and ozone mixed and mingled
with the faint perfume of the earth
and a million growing things the blaz-
ing white sands shouted back at the
blazing blue of the sea and sky little
brown children ran naked laughing and
happy the wind bowed the palms and
blew the leaves of the artu and the
fronds of the tree fern

  ill show you the road to martelps
house said macadam and when you
have done with him you can make use
of mine till you are fixed and if youll

come and have luncheon with me to-
day ill be very pleased theres no
hotel here

  they found the old frenchman in
and fairly friendly he sent a kanaka
with them to show them the only place
he had to let it was lewins house
of old time and rather gone to pieces
but the godown lewin had used for
storing his trade was in good repair

   it will do us finely said mrs beaz-
ley and ill make it lovely with those
curtains and things we have brought

 and oh what a sweet little garden
wait till you see it when i have been
over it with a spud and hoe take
the place jack dont be put off by
the tumble-down look of the house a
hundred dollars will make it a little
palace

  beazley took the house that after-
noon and with the help of macadam
secured native labor to help in repair-
ing it the godown was in much bet-
ter condition a days airing and an-
other days fumigating with a bonfire
of dry hibiscus sticks to drive out in-
sects and other undesirable tenants
made it fit to receive the trade goods
from the tamalpais

  meanwhile the beazleys lived on
board the schooner sleeping there at
night breakfasting on board and bring-
ing provisions with them on shore

  after superintending the kanakas
working on the house or in the garden
or those engaged in bringing the trade
on shore they would have luncheon or
dinner picnic fashion on the beach or
in the woods

  it was the time of the full moon
which rose early these nights and lit
their return to the schooner

  navahoe by day was beautiful but
on warm nights like this with the moon
upon the palm trees and the fireflies
dancing on the fringe of the woods
stars and moon making a mirror of the
anchorage and the reef singing its
the luck of cavtain slocum



drowsy song navahoe was more than
beautiful

  at least so little mrs beazley
thought as she leaned on the rail of
the tamalpais while beazley smoking
a cigar leaned beside her and they
talked and plotted and planned for the
future

  mrs beazley felt herself absolutely
outside the world that she knew in
this place there was no post letters
came occasionally by a mail brigan-
tine or a stray warship and letters
placed in the pillar box by the club
would be collected and stored by mac-
adam and dispatched by a stray war-
ship or the mail brigantine but you
could not be sure in your own mind
that anything you mailed would ever
reach the person you mailed it to as
a matter of fact the sense of uncer-
tainty was entirely an illusion noth-
ing in the world travels more surely
to its mark than a letter whether you
post it at nenkohee in the sea letter
box at the straits of magellan or in
the general post office of chicago
still mrs beazley did not know this
she only knew the illusion and it fed
her sense of isolation

  macadam had shown her the latest
newspaper on the day of their first
arrival it was four months old he
had shown it to her as a joke for the
news of the world brought by the
tamalpais was months fresher than
that

  the feeling of loneliness begotten of
these things made the little woman
cling closer to her husband they
were rarely apart and indeed the so-
cial life at nenkohee held out few in-
ducements to draw him away from her

  there was the club a drink shop
and little more there were macadam
and old monsieur martell both of
whom had their limitations and lastly
but not leastly there was captain slo-
cum known to all men as the cap-
tain

ca

  slocum was in fact the chief man
at nenkohee

  landed here two and a half years
ago and more said macadam to
beazley he brought ashore with him
a kanaka baby hed picked up in one
of the islands set great store by it and
called it his luck well it certainly
was that in a way for hes been ex-
traordinary lucky in business here
hes got a schooner the contra costa
which does all his trading he owns
it and hes got a fellow called am-
brose whos her captain and a sort of
partner good business man too he is
slocum wasnt a bad sort of old chap
when he came here first and had to
fight his way against lewin and sakers
but since he knocked them out and
grew prosperous hes got swelled head

  beazley it will be remembered had
a letter of introduction to the captain
from lewin he had mentioned the
fact to macadam who had forgotten
to warn him not to present it the
innocent beazley though he knew that
slocum and lewin had been trade
rivals little guessed the depth of
hatred that had lain between them he
knew nothing of the contents of the let-
ter which was sealed

  one day as he was drinking a glass
of lemonade at the club the captain
came in and ordered a cocktail

  the two men had not yet met but
they knew one another by sight the
captain cock of the walk at nenkohee
violently resented the coming of an-
other trader he had heard of the
lewin business and of how lewin had
let beazley down and that knowledge
did not increase his respect for the new
man

  he was lifting his cocktail to his
lips when beazley spoke

  captain slocum i believe said
beazley

  the captain sipped his drink and
placed it on the counter


the cpcpulacp magazine

  slocums my name said he and
what may i ask might yours be

  beazley replied the other and
by the way i have a letter of intro-
duction to you from a man called
lewin he served me a dirty trick and
i dont think hes a particular friend
of yours still it may amuse you to
read it

  he took the letter from his pocket-
book and handed it to slocum

  the captain took it put on a pair of
old spectacles which he used on the
rare occasions when he had to read or
write opened the envelope and began
to spell over the contents reading aloud
paragraphs here and there to himself
utterly forgetful of the presence of
beazley and the kanaka behind the
bar

  hope you and your nigger baby are well
-keep off the drink old grog-blossom for
the bottle will be your rewin if the lord
hadnt spoilt you in the bakin you might a
been half a man

  a nice sort of letter of introduction

  why blister it cried the captain
suddenly dashing the letter and spec-
tacles down on the counter youve
got the face to bring me a letter like
this here and sit laffin at it dont tell
me i saw y-

  i swear i did not know what was
in it said beazley yes i was
laughing but not at you i was laugh-
ing at myself for having carted that
thing about in my pocket for the last
three months tear it up and forget
about it

  the captain put the letter back in
his pocket then he put his spectacles
in their case then he finished his cock-
tail wiped his mouth on the back of
his hand and moved to the door

  ill larn them as has no manners
said he addressing no one in partic-
ular

  beazley went home and told his wife
the joke

  it was no joke in reality for he had

hit the captain on his swelled head
and that is always a dangerous thing
to do especially in the case of a man
like slocum

  mrs beazley did not look on the
thing as a joke however especially
when she heard how slocum had taken
it

  george said she you ought to go
and apologize

  i-why what have i done 
  apologize for laughing at him

  i did i explained that i was laugh-
ing at myself for having howked the
thing round so long

  well i wish it had not occurred
said mrs beazley

  there was no use in wishing how-
ever and indeed the matter did not
make things much worse for the beaz-
leys for the reason that captain slocum
had taken a down on beazley from
the first macadam was right slo-
cum was suffering from that most de-
testable of all mental complaints the
swelled head that comes from success
i do not know anything that makes men
more brutal selfish and unfit for the
kingdom of heaven than this disease

  slocum after two years and a half
in navahoe was doing big business
his schooner the contra costa came
and went between the island and syd-
ney always with full cargoes the
island little known was untroubled for
him by competition so much so that
as a matter of fact he could not han-
dle the whole of the copra it produced

  he had thought of extending his
business and buying another schooner
or chartering one his difficulty lay
in the fact that long experience had
taught him not to trust men too much
ambrose the captain of the contra
costa he could trust implicitly and
he chose to leave it at that besides
a second schooner would mean end-
less outlay and expense

  the arrival of the beazleys altered
all this here was competition and
the luck of captain slocum



competition moreover sent against him
by the hated lewin the letter of
introduction finished and sealed the
business

  i aint a particular man said the
captain to macadam but theres
things no man can swaller and i cant
swaller them beazleys nohow what
did the chap want bringin his wife
here for there aint no wimmen here
for her to consort with and he thinks
hes goin to do business well he thinks
wrong

  look here cap said macadam
theres no harm to the beazleys and
you know jolly well you cant handle
all the stuff here yourself

  who says i cant asked slocum

  i do the island could produce
nearly half as much again or maybe
more in copra and it doesnt simply
because theres no incentive to the kan-
akas to put in more labor and time
over their work if you want to keep
the place to yourself why not get an-
other schooner

  and who says i wont replied the
captain ive been thinkin of it for
months and when ambrose is back
with the contra costa ill see it done
they cant make small of me ill larn
em

  meanwhile the beazleys were get-
ting in all the trade stuff on board
the tamalpais was transferred to the
godown and mrs beazley superin-
tending the kanaka workmen was put-
ting blinds up in the new house and
spreading matting on the floors

  it was a pleasant house situated just
outside the town and beyond captain
slocums and mrs beazley sometimes
on passing the captains house would
see the captains chief treasure the
luck as every one in nenkohee called
it playing in the garden digging or
dragging a little toy cart

  she had heard the story of it from
macadam how it was the baby of a
kanaka chief who had died with all

his tribe of smallpox-so the story
went-how slocum had saved it how it
had brought him good fortune and
how when arnold the missionary had
christened it the captain had insisted
on naming it luck

  it seemed to her much lighter in
color than the natives she had hitherto
seen it was a most engaging child to
look at and her womans heart went
out to it one day in passing she had
spoken to it and it had come up to the
railings nothing loath and began some
lisping remarks when a gruff voice
from the house called it in

  mrs beazley passed on half laugh-
ing

  she had seen the captain several
times in the town and she was not in
the least afraid of him and despite his
open hostility she felt no animosity to-
ward him

  i dont think hes as bad as he
seems said she to her husband you
know i have feelings about people-
and dogs i cant stand slithering sort
of people-you remember lewin he
was all smiles and he used to speak
in such a soft voice and his hands-
the palms of them-were cold and
damp it was like shaking hands with
a fish im sure the old captains hands
are not cold and damp

  beazley laughed

  the house was now in order and it
was time to think of opening up busi-
ness with the natives

  the fellow for you to go to said
macadam is tapatukeea hes chief
over there on the north side of the
island and his people own a lot of
trees slocum takes part of his copra
but not all in fact tapatukeea was
grumbling to me some time ago saying
it was a pity there wasnt another trader
here to do business with dont say i
told you this though

  beazley thanked him for his advice

  how do you get there he asked

  you can easily walk and for a few


the popula magazine

cents you can get a kanaka to guide
you

  next day the beazleys having hired
a lusky individual for guide packed
some lunch in a basket and started off
for the village of the chief

  there was a fairly good road the
day was glorious and a wind from the
sea followed them cooling the air and
waving the palm fronds and ferns that
lined the way they passed groves and
groves of palm great tracts of mammee
apple and dark dells of fern huge
trees of centuries growth and unknown
name shaded the way here and there
colored birds flew overhead and colored
butterflies led them and all the time
as far as they went on far as they
might go the song of the reef beyond
the anchorage followed them on the
wind

  the way led up and up till they
reached the plateau that formed the
summit of the island it was clear of
foliage with the exception of one or
two trees that looked like screw pines
looking around one could see the pa-
cific on every side-blue desolate and
beautiful here they sat down and
had luncheon the dusky one vanishing
and returning with some bananas and
after the meal beazley smoked and
they talked of the future happy and
careless as children

  then they resumed their way going
downhill through groves of banana and
fields of taro till they reached the vil-
lage which was situated on a cliff edge

  there was no reef on this side of the
island and the sea unbroken came
blue and thundering up to the cliffs
the whole place was filled with the
drone and boom of the water on cliff-
side or in cave the village was al-
most deserted the folk being away at
work but the chief tapatukeea was
at home and exceedingly friendly in his
reception of the beazleys but he could
sell them no copra he had none in
fact to sell he had concluded a con-

tract with captain slocum under which
he was bound to deliver all copra gath-
ered by his people to slocum and to
none other

  when did you sign that contract
asked beazley

  it was yesterday replied tapatu-
keea

  he wants to freeze us out said
beazley half to himself half to his wife
he cant handle all that stuff he has
and now hes going in for more-
swine

  mrs beazley said nothing she
looked thoughtful and then assured
in their minds that nothing could be
done they bade good-by to the friendly
chief and returned to the south side
of the island and home

  they had delayed a long time at
tapatukeeas and when they reached
the plateau the sun had set and the
moon was rising

  that does us said beazley we
wont do any good here that pig in-
tends to gobble all the copra thats to
be had he knows all the ropes and
he had got before us i should have
gone to tapatukeea the day before yes-
terday

  well tapatukeea doesnt own the
whole island said mrs beazley we
can try other people

  we can try them said beazley
but i dont think itll be much use
slocum has bought the whole crop in
advance if i am not very much mis-
taken and he has done it to freeze us
out

  he was right

  next day making diligent search he
could find no one to trade with

  copra is the kernel of the coconut
the nut is broken in two the kernel
taken out dried and strung on a
string it is valuable but only in bulk 
to make any profit out of it one must
handle large quantities and though i
have said that beazley could find no
the luck of captain slocum



one to trade with that statement is not
rigidly correct there were several
small growers who were ready to deal
with him but they were so solall that
slocum with a fine contempt had
passed them over

  mrs beazley was out when her hus-
band returned from his second fruitless
journey he was making himself some
lemonade when she returned and when
she heard his tale she sat down like a
person upon whom a heavy burden has
suddenly fallen

  well she said with a sigh we
must go thats all oh dear and i
was so happy in this house and the
place is so beautiful and the natives-
i simply love them they run to me
if they are ailing and they tell me their
affairs they are just like children and
i have to leave them

  she wiped her eyes and beazley
stood by biting his lips

  he was cursing slocum

  it was just as if slocum had hit his
wife

  it was a bitter failure all the more
bitter on account of the sweetness of
the place and the kindness of the
people

  slocum had once suffered in this
island from the effects of a tabu put
upon him by the lying stories of lewin
and his partner sakers but this trou-
ble was not in the nature of a tabu
the natives were willing to trade and
indeed anxious to do so for mrs beaz-
ley had found their hearts it was not
a question of willingness however but
of copra they had contracted with
slocum to supply him with the stuff
and they could not go back on their
contract arnold the missionary was
unfortunately away else he would very
soon have brought slocum to his senses
slocum despite his hostility to mission-
aries in general had a respect for
arnold

  arnold not being available there was
no one to stand up to slocum or point

out the fact that in driving the beaz-
leys off the island he was injuring the
community and committing an act in-
congruous with honest dealing and fair
trading

  beazley went for a long walk to
work off his irritation everything
was now decided and he had given his
orders for the transport of all the trade
back to the schooner and the removal
of the house furniture on the morrow

  he returned at about six oclock in
the evening to find that his wife was
not at home at seven she had not
returned and taking his hat he started
off to look for her he met her at

                              

the gate

  oh george cried mrs beazley
poor captain slocums little child is
dying he came here himself to fetch
me and i have been doing what i could
for it-ive come back for the medi-
cine chest

  been here to fetch you cried the
outraged beazley like his cheek-
what do i care about his child to
fetch you-as if you were a hospital
nurse-after the way he has treated
me-

  mrs beazley took him by the arm
and led him into the house led him
into the sitting room went and fetched
the burroughs-welcome medical tab-
loid chest and opened it

  there is no use in thinking of that
said she the little child did nothing
against us the captain may be a
wicked and hard man but he loves it
and he cant be quite bad think if it
was our own

  the beazleys had lost a child the
only child that had ever come to them
and this shot told

  he sat silent while his wife went
over the contents of the chest

  it has convulsions said she and
can scarcely breathe i am going to
give it a gray powder if i can get it
to take it old doctor turner at syd-


the populjr magazine

ney told me-that time-that its al-
ways safe to give a child a gray pow-
der and that in many cases it will save
their lives if its lungs or stomach are
bad

  well i dont want to stop you
said beazley poor little chap-

  its a girl said she its a dar-
ling and ive always wanted to take

it on my lap and-and-- she went

off hurriedly  and beazley left alone
lit a pipe

  beazley was one of the men who can
hate and keep hatred glowing he was
also a generous man and as men go
emotional he was satisfied with the
fact that the captain was getting pun-
ishment yet he hoped the child would
live

  mrs beazley did not return that
night and he slept on the cane lounge
in the sitting room at breakfast time
she appeared happy and weary look-
ing and with good news

  its safe now said she i dont
know whether it was the gray powder
or not but it took a turn for the better
in the night and now its asleep-yes
it will live she took a cup of tea and
some food and then she went upstairs
to lie down and have a sleep herself

  beazley having covered her with a
rug and drawn down the blinds to keep
the light out took his hat and went off
to superintend the removal of the trade
from the godown

 a hundred yards away from the
house he met the captain who came
up to him in a furious manner as if to
pick a quarrel

  look here said that gentleman
me names slocum and them that
knows me knows me for a straight
man im goin to be straight with you
and i dont deny i took a down on you
more particular considerin the letter

of that pig lewins let that be you
want copra-well you can have it

  thanks said beazley but ive
made all arrangements to leave here
and seek copra elsewhere

  you aint goin off this island said
slocum what you want pushin a
man for dy want to make me polo-
gize i aint one to pologize not on
your life now dont you mind me
im dragged this way and that im het
up-but i say man to man you stay
here and ill help you all i can its
that kid shes alius bringin me to
my bearins showin me the sort o
fool i am shes shown me now i
acted like a skunk cornerin the copra
against you why that kid shes my
mainstay-shes the compass that keeps
the fool end of me hindmost i called
her me luck and i guess she is and
ony for your missis id a lost her last
night sure well then heres my hand
-youll stay 

  yes ill stay said beazley taking
the huge hand

  arnold the missionary when he ar-
rived back a month later found the
beazleys well installed prosperous and
a great addition to the place

  when he heard the whole story he
laughed-he was talking to mac

  youre not what they call a reli-
gious man macadam said he but
theres an everyday religion you stick
fairly close to the religion that rules
between men and regulates their deal-
ings if the old captain hadnt that
child to care for hed have been off
the track with the beazleys and theyd
have gone and some worse trader
would have taken their places he
calls it his luck it is give a man
something to care for and you give
him a piece of luck call it a woman
call it a child call it a dog-its luck
all the same

 five hundred head for a ranger

being the adventures of bill gillis and the kid texas rangers
on pirate island in the rio grande

by b m bower and buck connors

a two-part novel-part one

chapter i

irate island sounds as
though it should grow coconuts
and breadfruit and colonies of
strange sea birds that nest in the
cliffs and fill the air with their scream-
ing before a storm and a coral reef all
foamy with breakers upon the one side
and beautiful blue transparency upon
the other and a hidden channel through
which low rakish feluccas slip in sin-
ister silence the very name visions
plank walking and a general blow-
high blow-low for-what-cares-he at-
mosphere pirate island sounds as
though it belongs to that part of the
map which holds the sargasso sea
all of which proves how little there is
in a name

  pirate island is none of these things
it can scarcely be called an island even
-if you demand the full geography
definition and insist that it shall be sur-
rounded by water it lies a fair-sized
chunk of broken land in the river bed
of the rio grande and for most of the
year it is an island in name only with
dry river bed on one side and a tangle
of dry washouts on the other and little
ridges and a jungle of horseweeds and
cottonwoods and underbrush all over it
and the boundary line running through
-that is pirate island wild enough
and rough enough and god-forsaken
enough in all conscience but not what
the-name would lead one to expect

  far from being given over to piracr
it held somewhere hidden away in its
tangle of washes and ridges and jungle
growth the outpost camp of the texas
rangers set there to guard the mexican
border

  where theres a boundary between
two nations there will be lawbreakers
smugglers always and now and then
fugitives from the justice of one coun-
try or the other-always some one who
wants to slip across the line where he
shouldnt and because he shouldnt it
is all very simple when you stop to
think of it then there is opium for-
bidden in the united states and with
the price thrust skyward because when
the law wiped opium off the list of per-
mitted things it did not-because it
could not-wipe out also the craving
for it among the victims of the drug
always there will be men who count
the profit before they reckon the rik
of getting opium across the line under
the noses of the customs officers also
there was at this time a continual cry -
ing need of guns in mexico and many
pesos to be earned by the simple method
of slipping them over the border where
the federals commanded the country
on the side of guadalupe clear up to
the boundary and the revolutionists
held the other side juarez in the hands
of orosco and guadalupe in the hands
of ortega and both wanting guns-all
they could get it was a mere matter

    other adventures of bill gillis and the kid were published in the issues of popular dated de-
cember  and december 


the popular magazine

of selling to the highest bidder the
customs officers could watch the high-
ways but they could not patrol the
whole boundary line hence the detach-
ment of rangers kept down there to
help out

  smugglers down that way dont like
the texas rangers on the texas side
the dislike manifests itself in an occa-
sional shot from ambush and in frame-
ups in the little towns where rows
are hopefully started in saloons and
bullets are set whining and a ranger
is the target they learn to be cau-
tious those rangers they learn to go
with their eyes open and their mouths
shut and to sit with their backs to the
wall and to feel that their best friend
swings at their hip and that no man
may be trusted beyond a certain point
in texas the lawbreakers hate the
sight of a ranger over in mexico
everybody hates them for one reason
or another

  it is known that there is a standing
offer in mexico of five hundred head
of cattle for a ranger-alive or dead
just so its a ranger no one knows
for a certainty who pays the reward
you will not see the offer posted up in
public places either but the offer is
there and every mexican knows it and
every ranger if one could walk out in
broad daylight and shoot a ranger and
collect the reward upon his body there
would be many a greaser going into
the cattle business many have tried
it-and it is because many have failed
that the reward is made so tempting
it cannot give the ranger a comfort-
able feeling of security to know that
every mexican looks upon him as a nice
little start in life if only he could catch
the ranger out somewhere alone and
off his guard

  the kid with the star so lately
pinned upon his breast that his fingers
still strayed up that way occasionally
to feel the new dignity of its presence
rode humped in the saddle and saying

never a word to his partner though
silence was not his habit the kid
was tired and he had the blues and
he was almost sorry that he had ever
joined the ranger force at all he was
tired because he had just come in off
a long hard heartbreaking trip to the
franklin mountains and had no more
than washed the dust off his face and
filled his empty stomach at the ranger
headquarters in ysleta when the cap-
tain sent him forth again to pirate
island with bill gillis

  the kid had naturally expected to
rest a while and to be hailed a hero for
what he had done for he had brought
in his man to bring in your man and
three peons and dozens of brand-new
confiscated rifles the kid considered an
achievement of which a man twice his
age might be proud to bring in your
man in face of the fact that your man
once saved your life and should by all
the laws of common gratitude be left
his liberty the kid considered a sacri-
fice upon the altar of duty that should
lift you up to the dignity of a martyr

  instead the captain had not so much
as grunted a word of approval the
captain had told him just how to go
about turning his prisoner over to the
united states marshal and in the next
breath had ordered him to pirate
island why bill gillis even had re-
ceived more consideration than had the
kid though bill had merely achieved a
sprained and dislocated shoulder on the
trip the captain had told bill to take
care of himself because he was too
valuable a man to be laid up he had
not said a word about van dillon being
valuable for all the service he had ren-
dered-on his very first mission at
that the kid did not want to be
petted and coddled but for all that he
felt that the captain failed to realize
just how much he had done for the
force and to appreciate the fact that
he had handled a stiff proposition as
well as bill even could have done it
five hundred head for a ranger



  over in mexico the sun was sliding
down behind a ragged range of moun-
tains and the shadows were taking the
faint purple tinge of the afterglow
nearer a long line of tall cottonwoods
stood up in dark silhouette against the
sunset before them lay the military
bridge that spanned a boggy strip
where the rio grande had overflowed
upon the lowland at one end of the
island

  well there she is bill remarked
cheerfully though the silence between
them had lasted for ten plodded miles
this is pirate island right ahead of
us

  the kid glanced morosely at the
woods beyond the bridge and said noth-
ing at all

  campll be up in the neighborhood
of monument twenty i reckon bill
went on ignoring the sulks thats
wrhere we generally make camp better
catch up boob van and lead him the
rest of the way

  hes followed so far all right said
the kid sullenly glancing back to where
the pack mule loitered to fill his mouth
with some green stuff that he liked

  bill looked straight at the kid and
though bill was a little man not as
tall as van by six inches and though
his glance was mild the kid swung his
horse around and went back after
boob bill smiled a little and awk-
wardly rolled himself a cigarette awk-
wardly because one arm was in a sling
he knew very well what ailed van
dillon when a boy of eighteen chooses
to make one reckless jump from boy-
hood into the ranks of picked men who
have no time to pet their little personal
feelings the readjustment of his men-
tal perspective is going to be violent
and at times exceedingly painful bill
was sorry for the kid but he did not
feel that he could help van except by
leaving him alone he rode slowly
until van overtook him still sulky and

leading the reluctant boob they went
on together neither speaking

  dark came while they were traveling
a blind trail up the island a trail which
bill seemed to know very well but
which to van looked like a mere fol-
lowing of the line of least resistance
through the weeds and undergrowth be-
tween the groves of cottonwoods the
moon came up big as a barrel and yel-
low as california gold and their way
became ghostly peopled with gigantic
shadows that moved weirdly as the
breeze swayed the bushes and trees
and weeds bill slipped in ahead of
the kid and kept the position once
when van spoke sharply to boob bill
looked back at him quickly and made a
gesture with his good hand the kid
read it as warning and afterward he
rode as quietly as he could bill he
noticed made little noise and some-
times stopped abruptly to put a branch
carefully out of his way or rode around
obstructions that would be likely to rus-
tle more than usual

  halt a voice called suddenly-so
suddenly that the kid jumped they
were in black shade and they had come
on with scarcely a sound and that
sharp command came from somewhere
-not loud but distinct and with a tim-
bre that stopped them where they were

  howdy charlie bill called back
softly after three seconds of silence
some note to be stopping two law-
abiding gents this-a-way hootin up
there on a limb like a durned owl he
chuckled and urged his horse forward
through the gloom

  the kid followed him with a queer
pang that was almost physical some-
thing there was in bills tone that
spelled affection something there was
that set this unseen sentinel apart from
others the kid felt it vaguely

  from somewhere above and ahead
of them the voice answered that
you bill i kinda thought maybe it
was when i got a glimpse of you cross-


the tpovula magazine

ing that moonlight open space away
down thought i got that three-quarter
seat of yours how are yuh old scout 
a slim little fellow appeared suddenly
beside bill and reached out to grip his
hand whats the matter with your
paw bill  what you doing down here
all crippled up he laid an arm over
the neck of custer and gave the kid
a swift appraising glance that seemed
to set him aside afterward as a person
of no consequence whatever going
to stay down here  he added to bill

  oh i reckon ill get to stay a while
anyway hows she piling up charlie

  again the kid felt something in
bills tone that was different some-
thing that brought this strange charlie
close into his friendship and his confi-
dence and pushed the kid afar off to
the extreme edge of acquaintanceship
and bill-why bill had been the kids
pal his trail partner on that trip to
franklin pass friend of the brazos
peaks time that seemed so long ago
their close intimacy had seemed to the
kid as fixed as immutable as any of
the laws of nature yet a little man
had but to call out in the darkness and
bills voice even was different the
kid nudged eagle with his knee and
sent him a few steps forward into the
shadow again let bill throw in with
this charlie if he wanted to-much the
kid cared only he wished they would
jar loose so he could get on to camp
he wished-

  come back here kid bill called
softly but with a note of authority that
sent the kid all hot inside with unrea-
soning rebellion he twitched the reins
so that eagle turned and half faced the
two but he did not go back boob at
the end of the lead rope was browsing
contentedly at some new leaves on a
bush and did not move what yuh
want the kid asked shortly

  i want you to meet charlie horne
-my old side partner bills voice
was not conciliatory nor yet apolo-

getic  it seemed rather to place the
meeting of charlie horne as an im-
mense honor and it rasped the kids
temper

  hello charlie he grunted without
moving say bill do we go on to
camp or do we stay here the rest of
the night

  bill did not say any of the things
that he might have said things that
would have stung the kids pride intol-
erably he did not reply to the kid
at all he spoke instead to charlie in
that low monotone that makes words
indistinguishable beyond a few feet
and the kid was sure that bill was
talking about him

  just a kid was what bill was say-
ing to charlie jumped up his age to
twenty-one-only eighteen by rights
but dont say anything about it will
you-and joined the force got nerve
believe me run in jim lyons and a
gun train single-handed-tell yuh about
it later on headstrong-aint found
himself yet-but some kid believe me
jealous of you right now thinks a
good bit of me i reckon-i knew him
in brazos peaks and chummed with him
a lot he straightened in the saddle
as a signal that he was ready to go
well-see you in the morning he
said in a tone that van could hear
take care of yourself old-timer

  shore will charlie replied in that
same warm tone of affection waving
his hand to them before he disappeared
into the black shade behind him

  bill rode up to the kid passed him
and took the lead again he did not
say anything his method was to let
the sulks wear themselves out in the
belief that words merely emphasize the
mood the immediate effect of his si-
lence was to fix firmly in the kids
mind the idea that bill had no use for
him now that he had got with charlie
and to decide that he was going to hate
that same charlie horne

 ten minutes of slow progress
five h uncdcrecd hem for a cranger



through sparse undergrowth and across
a little natural meadow and they faced
another black grove bill stopped and
dismounted and handed the reins to
van hold custer for me kid he
said very cautiously camps just
ahead somewhere cant go loping up
on a bunch of sleeping rangers yuh
know ill locate em and let em know
whos coming

  all right said the kid in a whis-
per and leaned to peer into the black-
ness where bill had already disap-
peared it was all very mysterious and
very grim the kids mood lightened
with the knowledge that he was playing
a real mans game of chance and dan-
ger and that all this caution was born
of necessity and not for any love of the
spectacular his trip to franklin
mountains had taught him how grim
was the game presently he heard
bills voice raised a little and speaking
distinctly

  howdy boys this is bill gillis
why gol-darn your soul how are
yuh bill  there was welcome in the
voice that answered welcome and af-
fection that stirred the kid with a little
warm glow and made him forget al-
most his resentment against the strange
charlie they hung together these
texas rangers that was it--they
hung together and their friendships
were real the kid did not analyze
but while he waited for bill to come
back he felt that he knew what breeds
such friendships he knew that when
men ride out stirrup to stirrup knowing
that perhaps only one will ride back or
that the lives of them both may hang on
their courage and their loyalty to each
other friendships are born that set
those men apart from other men it
was that which had drawn him so close
to bill it was the danger they two had
faced together he had not realized
that others had also been drawn close to
bill gillis and to one another but now
he- felt a warmth in his soul where be-

fore had been chill loneliness and a
pride that he van dillon was counted
worthy a place among these men

  he went forward guided by bill and
he saw several white patches that he
knew for beds laid out in a little open
space in the horseweeds that grew high
all around them in two of the beds
men were sitting upright talking to
bill as to an old comrade returned after
an absence-which he was in a lighted
space where the moon shone through
the branches of a tree bill was pulling
with his good hand at the latigo of his
saddle while he answered questions

  the kid now that the monotony of
the long ride was over forgot his black
mood and went over and helped bill
get the saddle and bridle off custer
bill thanked him and went and squatted
on his heels beside one of the men
while van unsaddled eagle his own
saddle horse and afterward unpacked
boob he thought that they had com-
pletely forgotten his presence among
them so absorbed were they in low-
voiced converse-shop talk that would
have sounded strange indeed to the
world at large so steeped were the sen-
tences in life-and-death issues which
were merely a part of the days work
but when he pulled the pack saddle off
boob and with it the thick padding of
navaho blanket bill rose up and came
toward him

  horses are out beyond this grove
bill said one of the men you know
where that open is

  sure i know if i didnt old boob
would point the way all right well
put night ropes on custer and eagle
kid

  afterward bill showed him where to
place their bed in aclumpof fresh un-
trampled horseweed behind the fringe
of the outer edge bill trampled a space
large enough for the bed and stood
watching while van spread the blankets
and the tarp and tucked in the edges
from somewhere beyond came the faint

snapping of a discreetly small fire and
the delectable odor of fresh-boiling cof-
fee the kid turned his face that way
and sniffed made keenly aware of the
fact that he was ravenous

  come and get a cup of coffee boys
a voice called guardedly to van it
seemed as though these rangers never
spoke full-voiced as did other men
its a long time till morning

  aw you shouldnt have bothered
rudd bill protested gratefully a
cold snack would a done us all right
but he led the way hastily toward the
crackle and the tantalizing aroma

  no bother i can stand a cup of it
myself growled the voice and the
guard will be coming in directly-char-
liell be glad of some hes been off
his feed last day or so-didnt eat any
supper at all hardly

  again the kid felt a difference in
the tone-the same tender quality that
had been in the voice of bill when
charlie baited them out there in the
trail the same quality that had been in
the greeting flung at bill by the man in
the bed over there it was vry intan-
gible-the kid had no word to call it
by-but it was there

  the coffee was the best van had
ever tasted at least that was what he
would have told you while they were
still squatted in the faint warmth of
the dying blaze drinking and eating
cold bannock and cold bacon and joy-
ing in every mouthful some one spoke
in the darkness in a minute a form
van recognized as charlie came in out
of the gloom and laid a hand carelessly
down upon his shoulder over where
the beds were a man was moving out
quietly making ready to take charlies
place out there in the trail

  well kid how do you like it far
as youve got charlie leaned his
slim body forward and stretched an
arm reaching for the coffeepot he
leaned again in another direction and
reached a cup and began to fill the

night air with the fresh smell of coffee
while he poured

  all right the kid answered briefly
and was a little surprised because his
own tone was friendly

  ah-that shore hits me where i
live charlie observed and dangled the
empty cup from the forefinger of his
left hand i wish rudd would take
a chance and celebrate like this every
night a cigarette now and i can turn
in feeling that kings have nothing on
me

  the kid looked at him his eyes big
in the firelight he had been going to
dislike this charlie he had felt that
very distinctly half an hour ago but
now he knew that he couldnt dislike
him-not if charlie kept that manner
and that little drawly tone of good will
when he spoke to him

  better roll in kid safd bill quietly
and with the same note of authority
which was becoming his habit when he
spoke to van bill was sitting with
his knees drawn up and his crippled
arm resting across them in its sling
and he was smoking a cigarette with
much relish remember where you
were at daylight-youve hit a long
hard trail since then you turn in now
and get some sleep you sure need it

  so do you van retorted but in
a minute he got up and started back
toward their bed- in the horse weeds
standing with a hand outstretched to
part the weeds he looked back impa-
tiently but bill had made no move
to follow through the bushes he could
make out dimly the two figures sitting
hump-kneed in the fire glow though
he listened he could barely distinguish
the low murmur of their voices while
they talked-those two who had been
so glad to meet away back there in the
dark

  once more the feeling that he was a
stranger among strange men forgotten
by the one man to whom he uncon-
sciously clung for companionship set-
five huned hem for a ranger



tied like a cloud upon the kid he
unbuckled his six-shooter knelt and
placed the gun down under the blankets
as bill had taught him to do he drew
off his boots and tucked them under the
corner of the bed where his head would
rest and where his hand could go up
and find them instantly he listened
again heard no sound to indicate that
bill was coming and laid himself down
with a grunt of disgust it was a won-
der that bill wouldnt take some of his
advice to himself  bill had traveled the
same long hard trail which van had
traveled since daybreak and he had
traveled with a crippled shoulder

  moods that are unreasoning and
childish may come to a lad of eighteen
who has jumped recklessly into the
mans hard game of life moods that
he would never admit to any one him-
self least of all but such is the splen-
did resilience of youth those moods
are washed out upon the shores of
sleep van was a much disgruntled
youth as well as a weary one when
he pulled the blanket up over his head
and left only a breathing place with the
tip of his nose sticking out he was
going to show bill that he could be as
independent as anybody he wasnt
going to ask any odds of him or any
one else let them gang off by them-
selves if they wanted to-he could hold
his own he guessed-

  with the sharp discomfort of a fresh
hurt the dark bearded face of jim
lyons as he had looked at van before
he turned away to obey the curt order
of his jailer flashed across his mental
vision that look had cut deep into the
kids soul and for all his youth and
healthy optimism the wound it left
would not heal overnight never once
had he let jim lyons see that he had
recognized him never once had jim
lyons shown any sign that he recog-
nized van and yet at the last minute
he had turned and given van that long
bitter look-the kid squirmed as at a

physical hurt and burrowed deeper into
the blankets he wished bill would
come to bed vaguely he hungered for
the close presence of a friend wrho
knew and who must have understood
because never once had he mentioned
jim lyons on the long ride from
ysleta

  then came sleep the face of jim
lyons faded and was gone and van
dillon was just a boy dog-tired and
dreaming a boys inconsequential
dreams and muttering now and then
a blurred sentence addressed to boob

chapter ii

  to the kid fresh from sleep and
with a boys hunger riding him hard
camping on pirate island seemed very
much like camping anywhere else the
camp was quiet the island filled with
bird song and the peace that broods
over a wilderness men awoke and
stretched their arms and yawned after
heavy slumber and washed the sleep
from their eyes with cold water and
thought about breakfast they said
hello to the kid and afterward seemed
to take his presence as a matter of
course and the kid was content once
more with life bill awoke and smiled
at him with a glimpse of white teeth
and an endearing twinkle in his eyes
and the kid grinned shamefacedly in
response he hoped bill would not
mention his grouch of the day before
-and bill being wise in his way did
not

  a man came out of a thicket of green
stuff hitching his heavy gun belt into
place over his hips his eyes lighted
on van and widened a little with sur-
prise

  why hello he greeted cheerfully
aint you pretty far from home-for
a kid he came up and held out his
hand what you doing with yourself
away down here

  this was ranger kent unconsciously


the vocpulick maqhzine

the cause of vans presence there for
had not ranger kent very calmly and
very effectively cleaned brazos peaks
of its undesirable human element at the
behest of the law-abiding citizens one
van dillon would not so soon have
taken the fever of hero worship-the
fever that drove him headlong into
manhood and the fulfillment of his sud-
den overpowering ambition to be a
ranger van blushed with pride and
pleasure as he turned back his coat to
show the star

  im a ranger myself now he vol-
unteered with all the nonchalance of
which he was capable

  ranger kent looked at the star and
he looked at the kids round face
well ill be darned his astonishment
jolted from him bill how about this
is this boy-

  being of legal age and accepted by
the governor and the captain van dil-
lon sure is a ranger bill hastily and
convincingly assured him i saw him
take the oath myself i also rode along
with him when he took a bunch of gun
runners into camp--single-handed you
may say since i wasnt in a position
to help much we just got in when we
were sent down here bills manner
was perfect in its matter-of-fact seri-
ousness

  funny-i got the impression in
brazos peaks last winter that he was
just a schoolboy seventeen or eighteen
maybe kent spoke apologetically

  he does look young for his age--
thats because his dad wouldnt let him
shave until his twenty-oneth birthday
maybe bill looked up from the prob-
lem of pulling on his boots with one
hand i wouldnt have taken him for
more than eighteen myself if i hadnt
known different

  shiny-eyed the kid turned away to
him it seemed the supreme test of loy-
alty that bill should thus lie for him
to kent bill knew he wras not twenty-
one-why of course bill knew bill

could have put him out of the force if
he wanted to just on account of his
age they only had to write to brazos
peaks to find proof-but they wouldnt
because bill was going to stand by him
right at that minute the kid would
cheerfully have laid down his life for
little smiling loyal bill gillis who was
having trouble with his no  boots
while he went on talking to ranger
kent hero whom the kid had wor-
shiped for what he had done in brazos
peaks and last night he had been sore
at bill gillis not for a long long
whilev had the kid been so ashamed of
his shortcomings

  he went out of his way to make
overtures of friendship to charlie
horne who presently appeared from
some sequestered sleeping place and
found himself a comfortable place to
sit down cross-legged in the crude cir-
cle of breakfasters he got on all right
with charlie until bill strolled in among
them after that the kid found him-
self talking to ears that did not listen
after he had asked a question or two
that brought no answer at all the kid
ate his breakfast and listened to t-he talk
of the others of ortega and his rebel
forces at guadalupe and beyond from
the way they spoke the -kid gathered
the impression that it was very close
as miles went to the heart of the mex-
ican revolution he heard them name fa
familiarly the name of orosco who
commanded the federal army at
juarez also there was talk of gun run-
ners-upon which subject the kid felt
himself very well informed since he
had taken four of them to jail and
more than a dozen burro loads of guns
but when he started to speak about it to
charlie he discovered that charlie and
bill were having a little confab of their
own with their heads close together
and their voices lowered and a laugh
breaking now and then the mumble of
thir talk

  i want you boys ranger kent was
five hundred hem for a rnger



saying to keep an extra sharp lookout
jesu chaboya dont go to el paso just
to take in the picture shows hes one
of the brightest men in the junta and
he was seen coming out of boland
brothers hardware store at two in the
morning also its pretty certain that
boland brothers are ordering more
guns than their regular trade demands
so davis you and rudd can ride up
the river to-day and see if theres any
signs of burros crossing the river beds
either way theyll have to work pretty
well down this way before they can
cross on account of oroscos men

  dillon-thats your name if i recol-
lect right-ill let you patrol the lower
end of the island here and watch the
road between the river and fabens
horsemen can dodge the sentry at the
bridge by crossing down below the wil-
lows but theyre pretty apt to swing
back into the trail farther on if any-
body looks off color or cant show
straight passes take him to the river
guard you wont have any trouble
at all-the customs men are pretty thor-
ough and beyond them is the cavalry
so its mostly just stopping any chance
leak there you can handle it all right

  the kid did not say anything he
drank the last of his coffee sent a
glance toward bill and saw that bill
was listening to something that charlie
was saying and smiling that smile which
on the lips of a girl would be called
lovable or something like that the
kid got up and walked away before
the undergrowth quite hid the group
from his sight he stopped and looked
back not a head was turned to glance
after him not a voice was lifted to
give him a last word absorbed in
themselves and in one another and in
the work they had to do not one of
them seemed aware that he was leaving

  at the camp-but i aint in it by a
darned sight he muttered and parted
the bushes and went his way hang
around the road to pick up anything

the river guard lets slip-its easy i
can do it whereat the kid laughed
disagreeably its a wonder he didnt
put me tending camp oh well hes
got things to learn-thats all

  ranger kent would no doubt have
been extremely humiliated had he
known how low he sank in the estima-
tion of the kid ranger kent had
nerve enough-the kid was willing to
grant that-but he certainly had some-
thing to learn about the stern virtues
and the cool-headedness and the good
judgment of at least one of his men
ranger kent was certainly overlooking
a bet when he sent a certain person off
on a boys job with gun runners getting
busy he was foolish not to use all the
good men he had he might have sent
bill down the road to see if folks looked
honest and had their passes in their
hind pockets it would be all right for
bill till his shoulder got well on the
whole the kid did not think as much
of ranger kent as he had thought of
him in brazos peaks

  so he went down the dim trail that
was mostly a matter of guesswork and
when he came to the dusty highway he
turned sulkily and rode down toward
the border

  it was very quiet and very green
along that trail after the barrenness
of his trip to franklin mountains this
river bottom seemed waste fully luxuri-
ant it was peaceful and it was not in
the least like the dividing line which
separated him from a land torn with
deadly convulsions of internal war
orosco at juarez ortega at guada-
lupe hundreds of men ready to fly at
one anothers throats-it all seemed so
many words to the kid who had never
looked upon bigger warfare than a
personal fight

  the hoarse blat of an automobile
horn stilled the bird songs and straight-
way the kid was blinking in a dust
cloud raised by a dingy green roadster
wherein were seated two perfectly ob-


the cpocpular magazine

vious american citizens van did not
think they looked as though they needed
searching and he let them whiz past
him hazardous work this-riding
along the public highway policed al-
ready at its point of crossing the border

  he went on till he came to that line
which was not far he fraternized
apathetically with the guard who was
also bored with his duties and wished
he was in the navy he watched the
guard hold up other perfectly obvious
citizens and let them go by he saw
others mexicans and americans strag-
gle up to the guard and interrupt his
discontent while they convinced him
that their mission was lawful it was
as simple the kid perceived as taking
tickets at a wild-west show

  up at fabens complained the river
guard is where they slip it over on
us or between there and here i should
say them that travels the road has
got the papers for it nine times in ten
theres blind trails across the bottom
though where they slip through to fa-
bens them we leave to the rangers to
take care of

  it may not have been a hint but the
kid presently left him and rode back
whence he had come this time he
went as far as fabens an apathetic lit-
tle tank station that squatted beside the
track and watched the trains go by
with the idea of furnishing an excuse
for his presence he bought half a dozen
sacks of smoking tobacco and some pa-
pers then he rode back again its
easy- can do this he told himself
sarcastically for about the fourth or
fifth time

  the sun was growing hot in his face
as he went down the dusty trail his
soul was steeped in a boys rebellion
against authority and not even the star
on his breast under his coat could quite
comfort him it takes years and a rip-
ened experience to bring steadfastness
either of faith or of purpose youth
requires frequent demonstrations to

keep his interest and his faith alive
to van jogging down this much-trav-
eled road in the growing heat of the
day all the hazard all the glory that
he had dreamed would come to him
with the ranger star seemed vague and
unreal and very far off he did not
even have bill with him to tell him
stories that stirred his blood with the
brave deeds of his fellows

  he sighted what looked like a trail
such as kent and the river guard had
mentioned and he turned into it dispir-
itedly he did not see any sense in
patrolling that road anyway the blind
trail promised more and his spirits rose
a little as he followed it into the thick
jungle growth of weeds and young
bushes

  faint openings where the horse weeds
had been broken by the passing of ani-
mals seemed to indicate that this blind
trail had many branches the kid did
not see how one man was going to ac-
complish much scouting around in that
jungle forty smugglers could slip past
him and if he did run across one it
would certainly be an accident still
he had been ordered to patrol this
neighborhood and so he meant to put in
the time riding somewhere he didnt
see any sense in it though if he had
the running of that camp on pirate
island and commanded those half
dozen men hed simply keep a ranger
stationed at fabens to hold up any sus-
picious-looking characters that tried to
catch a train there that was the place
to grab them in the kids opinion not
prowling around in here-hunting for
a needle in a haystack he knew it was
none of his business but he would sure
like to tell range kent a few things
he was eighteen remember which is
the age of much wisdom never again
though a man lives to be eighty will
he know as much as he knew when he
was eighteen

  because he had no especial destina-
tion in view he let eagle choose the
five hundcred heid for a ranger



trail for himself eagle had been on
the ranger force almost half as many
years as van had lived he knew
blind trails as he knew his oats box at
headquarters very likely he knew this
blind trail and where it led at any
rate he went forward steadily and
quietly and he made a few turns which
he would not have made had the kid
been guiding him instead of letting the
reins lie loose on his neck eagle had
carried the best men the force ever
knew-bill gillis for instance and
charlie horne and rudd and kent of
whose judgment the kid was thinking
with tolerant disgust while he rode-
and his training had profited thereby
he knew how to stand as still as a rock
so that he would not be seen or spoil
his riders aim when the saddle gun
came up he knew how to move softly
and how to save his wind when his
rider wanted speed and more speed

  just now he knew enough to look
and listen and draw in long breaths to
get the scent of any other animal the
kid did not know as he rode moodily
along that eagle was more alert than
he but when eagle stopped abruptly
and threw up his head and stared fix-
edly across a little open space where the
soil was pure soft sand and therefore
barren for the most part the kid
dropped the cigarette he was just ready
to lick into completion and eased his
saddle gun out of its scabbard he
did not see anything and he did not
hear anything-but he knew enough
about horses to take eagles word for
it that there was something ahead of
them on that trail

  with the carbine at half aim and
the reins held lightly between the fin-
gers of his left hand he pressed eagle
with his knees the horse ears perked
forward went on in a springy walk his
muscles tensed for a sudden lunge a
sudden swerve to one side or the other
or an abrupt whirling in the trail as
emergency or his rider rnight demand
ioa

  they crossed tfye little open space and
made no more sound than a cottontail
hopping over greensward eagle did
not stop but there was an indefinable
quivering and a stiffening of muscles
that warned the kid very softly his
thumb dragged back the hammer of his
gun his weight went to the stirrups
and his body poised and was ready-
for what he did not know

  so they went another rod through a
leafy thicket that seemed to be holding
its breath it was so still and they came
abruptly upon a horse that lifted up its
head inquiringly with a mouthful of
dangling vines it had just snatched
from off a bush its rider warned by
the movement looked up startled from
lengthening a stirrup and made that
significant backward movement of the
hand which comes to be second nature
to a man who lives by grace of good
luck alone

  quit it the kids voice cut the
silence

  the man looked into the round eye
of the carbine gave a sour grin and
lifted his hand in token of submis-
sion you beat me to it he conceded
dryly or i shore would have got you
this time kid

  oh i dont know the kid retorted
mechanically while his mind groped
dazedly for the meaning of this meet-
ing down here in the river bottom of
the rio grande i thought you was
in-

  jail finished the man well 
was but i aint now which being
perfectly obvious failed to get them
anywhere

  you will be predicted the kid if
you aint mighty careful theres a
ranger camp right around close and
these trails are pretty well guarded

  i see they are jim lyons grinned
again quite as sourly as before

  i dont see began the kid com-
plainingly how you managed to get
away and down this far-so quick


the povulatr magazine

and he added with a purely human in-
terest hows your hand

  pretty much on the bum yet-but
i can use it a little say why dont
you go ahead with the proceedings

  i dont see reiterated the kid
what youre doing this side the line it
looks to me like you dont give a darn
whether you get caught or not its an
awful chance to take

  not necessarily jim lyons was
looking at the kid with a growing ques-
tion in his eyes with my beard off
and these clothes a stranger wouldnt
recognize me by description-see  and
i dropped off at fabens in the night
when everything was closed up in my
haste at leaving el paso-he grinned
-i never stocked up with tobacco i
cant smoke that stuff the greasers hand
out

  well youre taking a long chance
if anybody should ask you the kid
declared ill-humoredly you want to
cut it out and stay across the river
heres tobacco and papers if you
dont object to their kind of matches
that heels you for a while anyway
with one hand the kid reached into his
coat pocket pulleds out the package
which the storekeeper had so painstak-
ingly wrapped for him and tossed it to
lyons it fell at the gun runners feet
and he stood looking down at it with
a comical blankness in his face the
kid deliberately slid his carbine into its
scabbard

  you better beat it back across the
line he advised with self-conscious
gruffness and stay there he swung
eagle around in the trail hesitated and
looked back over his shoulder his face
red with a boys embarrassment

  and say he said resting the flat
of his palm on eagles rump i dont
want you to think ive forgot about you
pulling me outa that quicksand because
i aint i had to take you to jail cause
you was smuggling guns and im a
ranger but this is different you aint

doing anything outa the way now and
the other deal you didnt git away with
anyhow we got the guns this is just
to-kinda square the quicksand deal
so long

  he rode away at a trot looking red
and confused but nevertheless exultant
a load whose weight he had not fully
realized until it was removed had lrfted
from his heart he owed this man his
life and now he did not have to shun
remembering how he had repaid the
debt he did not have to think of jim
lyons in jail facing a prison sentence
for smuggling he had instead the ex-
hilarating sensation of having done the
scar-faced one a great favor he began
to whistle while he rode back to the
dusty highway and then he remem-
bered that he must ride cautiously

  gee bill would just about skin
me for making all that racket he
admonished himself and giggled hap-
pily over the thought of bills look of
shocked disapproval if he had caught
van at such an indiscretion as whis-
tling shrilly everybodys doing it
while he was on scouting duty pru-
dence had not yet become second nature
to the kid but he stifled his impulse
to holler and contented himself with
grinning and slapping eagle on his
sleek neck

  quite suddenly he came out upon the
highway again where the dust lay thick
and the sun beat down hotly the
glare of bright sunlight after the green
shade of the thicket half blinded him
and he shut his eyes tightly for a
breath or two when he opened them
a girl was- riding toward him on a little
gray pony coming from the south

  the kid had never paid much atten-
tion to girls being so wtholly taken up
with big heroic ambitions and with cul-
tivating the sterner side of mans estate
for all that he pulled himself straighter
in the saddle threw back his shoulders
and rode forward to meet her quite
conscious of his own importance and
five huncdcrecd head for a angbr



perfectly willing that the girl should
appreciate it also she was a pretty girl
dark of eyes with straight black eye-
brows and hair black and wavy and
with lips that were full and red and
cheeks that glowed with color she
was a very pretty girl and she smiled
a little smile when she met his eyes
and then she looked away

  she did not look like a smuggler or
a malefactor or a questionable character
of any sort yet the kid remembered
his orders and stopped her by the
straightforward method of swinging
eagle in front of the gray pony his
tone was very official-he had learned
something from watching the river
guard halt travelers who would cross
down below there

  sorry he said i must see your
pass im a ranger

  but the guard at the bridge he saw
my pass mr ranger she demurred
looking up at him through lashes un-
believably long and thick you must
be a very new little ranger not to know

that the guard-

  i know all about the guard the
kid suspected that he was being
laughed at you never could tell about
these girls anyway ive got orders to
look at the passes sorry but ill have
to do it whats your name

  well then it is anita montoya
what is your name

  the girl simply would not take him
seriously she acted as though it was a
joke his being a ranger and wanting
to see her pass the kid scowled and
threw open his coat so that she might
see the star with the tiny knobs on the
points and the fateful inscription
texas ranger force stamped deep
across it

  thats name enough he snubbed
her shortly where do you live

  in guadalupe mr texas ranger
force but reallyi cannot help it
only spare me and i promise mr
texas ranger force-

  the lips of the kid twitched and he
chewed the under one savagely aw
quit your kidding he commanded
gruffly let me see your pass i aint
here for fun

  no anita mantoya was young
but she really knew a great deal about
tones and glances and how to use them
and when not for fun well here
is my pass im sorry it is not nice and
clean-you see i use it so much my
aunt she lives at fabens and every
week i go to see her and i get the
american papers and the magazines
and bring them backfor me and my
brother to read did you think that i
look like a mexican invasion mr
texas ranger force

  the kid looked at her and tried not
to smile never mind what i think
you look like he blundered and
handed back the paper which seemed
to have been much used she reminded
him a little of a girl in brazos peaks-
a girl who sat in front of him in school
and whose braid he used to twitch
sometimes just to see her scowl over
her shoulder at him

  is it something very horrid  -she
persisted after the manner of pretty
girls the world over

  its fierce declared the kid who
had not yet passed from the teasing to
the sentimental stage of masculinity-
or if he had done so he did not know
it yet but it aint quite bad enough
to hang you ill let you go this time
oh thank you mr texas ranger
force she said in still another even
more provocative tone so good you
are to me that looks so fierce

  say i wish youd quit calling me
that the kid broke out impatiently
but with a very apparent willingness to
continue the argument i aint the
whole force quite

  no but i thought you were you
act as if you were and the american
army and all with that shot calcu-

lated no doubt to render him speech-
less for some time she struck the little
gray pony with a switch she carried and
rode away from him with much more
enthusiasm than speed since the ponys
lope had about the same stride as a
shoo-fly rocking-horse made for small
children

  the kid could have overtaken her
very easily but he did not he started
on toward the border and he made up
his mind that he would not look back
even hed show her 

  of course he did look back within
three minutes after his decision he
saw miss anita montoya now riding
after him but slowly and bending low
over the saddle horn her eyes search-
ing the ground for something neither
the man in him nor the boy in him
would let van dillon ride on until he
knew what it was that she was looking
for that was not in human nature he
turned and went back to meet her

  my bracelet-i threw up my hand
because a wind caught my hat and it
flew off it was so loose anyway-
but i cant find it

  your hand you mean or the brace-
let the kid grinned and dismounted

  mr texas ranger force you are
not very funny she quelled and dis-
mounted also

  say quit calling me that if you want
me to hunt your bracelet

  i asked you wrhat was your name
and that was the name you showed me
she said oh if i cant find it-i need
it now for the fiesta it is of silver
and my grandfather gave it to my
grandmother when they were engaged
and never once has there been a fiesta
in guadalupe without it-i shall never
dare let my mother know i lost it
she looked up at him quite unexpect-
edly and met the kids round honest
eyes fixed upon her face are you

coming to the fiesta mr texas-

  say my names van dillon the

kid interrupted her with some exas-
peration youve got an awful way
of kidding a fellow

  i called you what you showed me
to call you she defended demurely
just here is where i threw up my hand
-or perhaps it was farther along the

wind-

  i never felt any wind van com-
mented banteringly it must have been
the speed you was traveling

  oh it would be tiresome to repeat
all they said while those two hunted the
silver bracelet that had never missed a
fiesta and must not miss this next one
the conversation of an eighteen-year-
old boy and a seventeen-year-old girl
seldom is clever enough to bear the test
of repetition especially if the girl is a
pretty girl and not too shy to find words
easily and the boy happens to be on
extra good terms with himself an
hour before the kids mood would
have lent him silence he would very
likely have given anita montoya an
interested glance and ridden on with-
out even knowing her name

  as it was before the bracelet was
found he knew a good deal about anita
montoya and she knew quite a lot
about him though not everything she
would like to have known for instance
she did not know just where the ranger
camp was located and she did not know
how many men were there-for the
kid was not quite a fool even if he
did do foolish things and bill gillis
had impressed some things very deeply
upon his mind but she knew a good
deal more than she had known when
she first sighted him in the trail and
behind those black eyes writh the unbe-
lievable lashes her acute young brain
was swiftly filing away the things she
had learned

  the kid knew that she was an aw-
fully pretty girl and he liked to hear
her talk in that funny book fashion
with an odd little spanish twist some-
five hunwed hem for a ranger



times to the words and very little of
the crude slang he was accustomed to
he knew that he had found her brace-
let of silver at least a rod from where
she had first told him she threw up
her hand-that was why the finding
took so long-and that he was glad
bill gillis wasnt along he wouldnt
have had the nerve to put the bracelet
on her wrist and wish it on if bill had
been there he knew that she seemed
to think he was the candy kid all right
and that he hoped he wouldnt have to
stand guard saturday night so he could
slip over to that dance he was invited to

  what he did not know was this he
did not know that miss anita montoya
had not thrown up her hand to save
her hat from going off in a wind but
instead had made sure that he was not
looking and had then tossed her brace-
let of silver down in the edge of the
weeds beside a bush that she had
marked well and had ridden on two
rods or so before she turned the pony
around also he did not know that
miss anita montoya rode on to fabens
with a note from a certain person in
mexico to a certain person who would
call for it at the house of her aunt
whom she was to visit the note con-
cerned a shipment of guns and was
folded very flat and was tucked under
the insole of anitas right shoe and
that was why she screwed up her mouth
when she was walking along beside the
kid talking about the fiesta the note
had managed to wrinkle under the ball
of her foot and it hurt

  when the kid rode in to camp that
afternoon he had nothing to report to
ranger kent he had ridden faithfully
the highway and a few of the blind
trails that led from it but he said he
had not found anything a mere brace-
let of silver that must be worn to a
fiesta was not the kid decided of any
official interest to any one so he did
not mention it even to bill gillis

chapter iii 

  undersheriff gatewood having sold
at auction the worldly possessions of a
man who lived down below fabens on
the river found his way to camp in
time for supper that night he had
ieen one of the famous citizens posse
sent down to pirate island to prevent
a threatened invasion of rebel bandits
a few months before and he had not
forgotten how to find the place also
he remembered that the chuck in a
ranger camp is worth riding a few extra
miles-at any rate there he was with
a tin plate piled full on his lap and a
cup of hot coffee in his hand and a
grin on his sun-reddened face be-
tween mouthfuls he gossiped of events
up el paso way

  the kid inclined to silence and to
rose-hued meditation came out of a
retired spot to refill his cup and to get
more beans on his plate him sheriff
gatewood spied and recognized with
a surprised hello

  say youre the kid that brought in
them gun runners-white man and
three greasers-aint you the other
day

  yup said van cheerfully and
rolled his eyes to see if kent and the
others had got that proof of his

prowess

  your prisoner broke jail that same
night-jim lyons he calls himself here
they think a mexican trusty helped
him out he didnt have far to go
a-course to get over the line among his
friends too bad-a fellow takes all
kinds of chances running in some snaky
devil like that and then them simps
dont know enough to keep him i
know jim lyons from away back hes
a bad one too gun fighter and one of
the nerviest smugglers working on the
border used to be over in new mex-
ico till it got too hot for him you
boys have heard of him-scar face
they call him over there stands ace-


the cpocpulacr magazine

high with the mexicans and thats what
makes him so hard to get hes safe
soon as he steps over the line pretty
good work kid-bringing scar face
into camp was it you shot up his gun
hand 

  that was bill said the kid shortly
and retired into the shadows with his
plate and cup

  over his coffee cup bills eyes dwelt
upon the kid for a full half minute
before he turned to gatewood half
an hour later he followed the kid when
he went to look after his horse

 what was jim lyons doing over
on this side-and away down here
van he inquired casually after he
had made sure that no one was within
hearing

 the kid jumped jim lyons
why-is he over on this side he
did it pretty well for one of his age
if nature had not given him a pair of
round innocent blue eyes that grew
bigger and rounder than you would be-
lieve when he was under mental stress
of any sort he would have done it
much better as it was bill chuckled
deep down in his throat like a baby
when you first tickle its toes

  thats all right son nobody else
is wise-but between you and me the
trail must run straight and open to the
sky sabe 

 yes but i dont know what you

mean-

  oh yes you do sure you know
it didnt surprise you enough to know
that jim lyons was loose so you
must have seen him so he must be
down here-and he must have been on
this side  kid your face hasnt learned
to lie yet it will after a while-itll
have to you know i wondered what
made you hit the camp so happy-and
kid im glad he got away i am for
a fact hows his hand 

  getting better said the kid and
then flushed to his collar at having been

trapped so easily aw thunder he
grumbled you know everything
again bill gillis chuckled conta-
giously a man learns to read faces
like he reads range signs he has to
what did you tell him kid

  van faced the older man with a sud-
den frankness that might easily turn to
defiance of bills opinion i told him
he was taking too long a chance com-
ing over here he said i told him
there was a ranger camp pretty close
and the river was being watched
well you told him enough bill re-
marked dryly after a pause chances
are you didnt tell him what he didnt
know already-but you want to look
out how you go handing out informa-
tion dont answer questions for any
stranger anything they think its
worth while to ask about you take it
for granted we dont want them to
know ill tell you something kid
ortegas pushed his men up close to
the line-probably to receive the guns
and ammunition hes bought over here
before orosco beats him to them if
they made a mistake and stepped over
they wouldnt mind at all-and you
heard the record jim lyons has got
youre square with him now kid but
if you meet up with him again bring
him to camp just like he was a greaser
personal feelings van-we cant af-
ford to have any when they run foul
of our duty ranger work comes first
if it was your brother or mine that had

to suffer and jim---

  i know the kid cut in impatiently
but he was only after tobacco at fa-
bens bill i had a package i just
bought and i gave that to him and told
him to beat it he wasnt doing arry
harm he didnt have a chance to he
went back

  well thats all right-this time we
wont say anything to kent of course

but next time-

  i know-i dont have to be told
the kid turned away and bill went
five hundred head for a ranger



over and made sure that his own horse
had plenty to eat before he strolled back
to camp

  the kid looked after him doubtfully
it was queer how bill always got next
to everything he must be a mind
reader and then the kid grinned
bill it occurred to him did not know
quite everything after all he did not
for instance know about anita mon-
toya and the silver bracelet and the
fiesta and the invitation which he fully
meant to accept bill wasnt a mind
reader exactly even if he did have an
uncanny way of jumping at a conclu-
sion and landing flat-footed on a fact
the kid decided that much as he hated
keeping secrets from bill it would be
just as well if he did not mention anita
montoya and the fiesta he knew about
how bill would look at the matter bill
would spring that you-never-can-tell
stuff and then go to preaching again
and while the kid thought an awful lot
of bill he did hate to be preached at all
the time he presently forgot bill al-
together and began to wonder what a
fiesta right among the revolutionists
would be like

  he supposed it would be risky going
over there alone he supposed hed
better give anita a tip not to tell any
one he was a ranger or some smart
aleck might try to do him up and col-
lect the bounty theyd have a sweet
time trying-they wouldnt catch him
with his eyes shut or get a chance to
knife him in the back hed like to go
and stay as long as he liked and leave
-and then let them find out that there
was one ranger that didnt give a dam
for the bounty on him hed try and
see anita again and fix it up with her
to tell who he was after he had gone
he hoped he wouldnt have to stand
guard saturday night

  for that matter the kid did not
stand guard saturday night and the
reason for that lies in what happened
on this night while he was still up-

borne in spirit because of his two
chance meetings during the day

  the kid was stationed close to the
boundary line he had what is called
the middle guard which is that part
of the night when healthful youth
sleeps soundest the kid had been in
the saddle all day and the night was
very quiet because he must make no
noise he could not walk up and down
a certain beat as he had supposed sen-
tries must do he had to stand or sit
in one spot and he had to listen for
any little suspicious noise and he had
to stare into darkness and he had to
keep awake

  for an hour or so the kid did very
well he leaned back against a great
cottonwood tree and his wide eyes
stared into the blackness before him
that was mexico he had enough to
think about-for an hour or so there
wasnt much to this night-guard busi-
ness-he began to suspect bill of tell-
ing things just a little bit scary for his
benefit of course a fellow gets
sleepy-

  very cautiously-though he could
not see anything to be particularly cau-
tious about even if there was a bunch
of revolutionists within a few miles
it wasnt us they were fighting-very
cautiously because caution had been
dinned into him he moved a few feet
to one side and sat down on a stump
but there were ants in that stump and
he must have stirred them up or some-
thing he picked two off his neck and
one oif his hand and then he moved
back to the tree

  you bet a fellow can get sleepy stand-
ing in one spot in the dark the kid
knew what ailed him-he had been go-
ing without a smoke of course bill
wouldnt approve-but there wasnt
anybody close enough to smell a ciga-
rette or see the glow of it the kid
leaned his carbine against the tree got
out his papers and tobacco and by
the sense of feeling alone he made a


the vovulatr magazine

cigarette he felt better already more
awake he found a match and he
scratched it on the bark of the tree
beside him-and pow-w called a
rifle from out there in the dark and
sput-t the bullet struck six inches or
so below his hand and the match blaze
his carbine tilted toward him from the
jolt of the bit of bark pried loose close
against the barrel

  van jumped behind the tree his car-
bine in his hand cocked and ready to
shoot only there wasnt anything to
shoot at after the swift flash out there
of exploded smokeless powder he
didnt exactly know what to do no-
body had told him what to do in a case
like this so he did nothing which was
all that was expected of him

  men came running toward him from
the camp and one from farther down
the low ridge this was little charlie
horne and he reached the kid first
and found out that he was not hurt at
all and that he had merely lighted a
match and was pretty well scared at
the result

  now dont you let it worry you
charlie muttered comfortingly while
the others were coming up it was
a close call-believe me kid those
greasers can shoot but you wont pull
off a stunt like that again so just con-
sider you learned cheap if kent bawls
you out just grin and take your medi-
cine but dont go and feel bad about
it we all make mistakes he gave
the kid a hasty pat on the shoulder
and slipped back to his own station
before kent arrived his sympathy
was the only pleasant feature of the
occurrence and heartened the kid even
when kent ordered him back to camp
and left bill gillis in his place

  ill trust my life to a cripple any
time before i will to a kid kent
grunted and did not say anything
afterward to ease the smart of it

  so that is why the kid did not have
to stand guard saturday night kent

wouldnt trust him on guard youd
think by jove that it was a crime for
a fellow to get shot at kent expected
a fellow to know everything without
being told anything how was the kid
to know that some one was over there
watching for a chance to pot him in
the dark kent never told him char-
lie horne was the only one in the bunch
that acted human about it even bill
had that what-did-i-tell-you look on
his face and a kind of knowing twinkle
in his eyes as much as to say that the
kid wouldnt take his word for any-
thing and to remind the kid that bill
had warned him against smoking on
guard-because you never can tell
the kid was beginning to hate those
four words

  he did not see anita again for kent
put him scouting through the breaks
at the upper end of the island with
davis who rode along in solemn silence
and never let his thoughts stray from
the business in hand but even if he
did not see anita he meant to dance
with her at that fiesta or know the rea-
son why

chapter iv

  when saturday night closed down on
the border with a whispering breeze
and bright starlight and no moon until
late the kid ate his supper with his
ears wide open he heard the men
assigned their stations and made a
mental note of the fact that bill gillis
was to stand guard at the trail up from
the bridge this suited the kid very
well for although he meant to slip past
bill if he could he much preferred to
have him stationed at the trail than
some of the others bill would cuss
if he caught him but he wouldnt tell
kent

  he muttered something about putting
eagle on fresh grass and went oft
through the dusk to the natural meadow
where the horses fed he pulled the
picket pin coiled the rope and led
five hundred head for a ranger



eagle across to the farther side of the
open with no attempt at concealment
in a grassy notch in the surrounding
thicket he staked eagle out again made
sure that there was no brush within
the radius of the rope and carried his
riding outfit over and placed it care-
fully beside the picket pin then he
went and took care of custer for bill
alter that he went back to camp and
went to bed

  as carefully as though he was a pris-
oner planning an escape the kid had
planned the details of his going he
lay well over on his side of the bed
with a fold of the blanket tucked under
his back so that bill would not feel the
kids trousers and boots when he
crawled in he turned so that he could
creep out of bed with the least possible
movement of the blankets and when
bill came over and started to undress
the kid was muttering unintelligible
sentences more convincing than a made-
to-order snore

  he completely fooled bill gillis
which proves how well he did it bill
got into bed for an hour or two of
sleep before he went on guard very
carefully so as not to waken the kid
who grunted get that mule outa-
mmmmm and moved so that he lay
still more on his face and grinned to
himself at the consideration bill was
showing in ten minutes-they seemed
an hour-bill began to breathe against
a relaxed palate that vibrated gently
the kid waited half a minute longer
-he thought it was ten or fifteen min-
utes at the least-and then he slid very
very carefully out of bed so as not
to waken bill

  hard as it was to do he actually got
away from there without being heard
he knew just where he could creep
through the bushes easiest and he knew
just where the shadows would lie thick-
est at the edge of the meadow he had
picketed eagle in that notch because a
shallow washout ran back of it and in

the bottom of the wash was a soft soil
and not much brush he could get
away down the gully without much
danger and once he was beyond the
guards work his way to the road get-
ting back was not so simple because
he was not sure that he could strike
that particular gully in the night from
the other end if he tried and missed
it he would run into rudd very likely
which would not be pleasant

  in not much more than half an hour
the kid rode cautiously out into the
blind trail more than half a mile from
camp the gully had really been a
short cut and he wondered why kent
didnt make some use of it there
were a good many bets that kent over-
looked it seemed to the kid

  he was too much pleased with him-
self however to waste any time think-
ing of the shortcomings of his chief
he felt that he had achieved something
-which he had he had put one over
on the camp that time on bill gillis
especially next time bill handed out
a lecture the kid could come back with
some of that you-never-can-tell stuff
some time when the play came right
he intended to tell bill about to-night

  a strange man was on guard at the
boundary line but the kid showed him
his star and rode on unquestioned
though not unwarned

  say kid daniel in the lions den
has got nothing orr you riding over
there to-night the guard exclaimed
admiringly you want to look out-
believe me thats a trip i dunno as
id care about taking right at this
time

  you aint a ranger the kid pointed
out patronizingly

  nor i dont want to be and you
better not go hollering it yourself
maybe you know your own business
best but if it was me id say i was a
vaquero for terrazas thatll let you
out if they go asking questions ter-
razas has got so darned many on his


the popular magazine

pay roil he dont know half of em
himself i reckon and a lot are ameri-
cans

  thanks said the kid not too ironi-
cal ill do that if i get up against
it so long ill be back in three or
four hours

  if some greaser dont take a notion
hed like to start up in the cattle busi-
ness the river guard supplemented
significantly

  they wont trade in my hide for
milk cows the kid retorted confi-
dently and rode away laughing these
fellows that were so afraid of their
skins ought to get a job clerking in a
shoe store he reflected

  after him coming frcfrn the deep
shade stole a much-bedecked individual
with a green sash and a red-and-yellow
serape and a greedy look in his eyes
but it was some distance to where his
horse was tied and the first fifty yards
must be traversed crouchingly so that
the tall weeds would hide him by
the time he was mounted and in the
trail van was far down the road and
getting farther every pulse beat for
when youth rides to a merrymaking his
steps do not lag

  long before he reached the place the
lights of the town winked invitingly
by the time he had passed the sentry
of ortegos-and he passed that sentry
because he remembered the name of
terrazas and used it and because
gringos are ignorant pigs who could
not be expected to know the password
and the sentry let him go as such-
the music of the fiesta came drifting
out to him in tantalizing snatches as
the breeze quickened or died

  with the sentry behind him the
kids spirits rose as for his courage
that never had ebbed he did not know
enough to be afraid of what lay under
those lights yonder  certain precau-
tions he took and felt himself equal
to any untoward circumstances he
did not ride directly toward the music

and the lights he--circled the village as
warily as a she-bear circles her kill
and he made sure of different street
ends which might offer a welcome pas-
sage to the open beyond just outside
the circle of scattering lights he staked
eagle with the rope he had brought
along there was grass and the horse
could feed while he waited

  the kid took his six-shooter from
his hip and slid it inside his shirt in
a sleeve holster he wore pinned his
star well back on the lining of his coat
pulled the wrinkles out of his collar
and the twist out of his tie took off
his hat and combed his hair down into
place with his fingers and started for
the dance and the girl whose guest he
considered himself to be

  he hated to go in his everyday
clothes like that but it was that or stay
away he hated to think that he had
to sneak in as it were but perhaps
that would add to the meeting the tang
of adventure which anita montoya
would like he had an idea there was
a good deal of dare-devil in that girl
and if she knew the risk he was taking
-of course she knew it bill said
they grow up knowing all about that
reward business

  his shoulders squared as he saun-
tered forward down a narrow cross
street that was empty toward a main
street that seemed jx bulge with the
crowd and the noise his hat he pulled
low over his eyes-some one might rec-
ognize him-and his cigarette he
smoked with much carelessness of
manner as if such scenes were familiar
to the point of being a bore

  at a long adobe building where the
crowd seemed to concentrate he
stopped and leaned against the wall
there was a sign whose meaning he
could get even if he did not know
much spanish-palacia de los fies-
tas which if it did not look much like
a palace was at least doing its share
five hundred hem for a ranger

in the fiesta within was music-a
pensively haunting spanish waltz

  outside was carnival there were
games going on and there was much
laughter and shouting and buying of
sweets and plenty of plain everyday
flirting it seemed to the kid that half
the men were soldiers-he knew them
by the arms they carried and by a
certain air of conscious importance
which they seemed never to lose as
for uniform there was none that he
could see serapes of every shade and
many patterns they wore and the
high-crowned native sombrero as for
the rest they seemed to favor plain
dungaree suits with pleats down the
trouser legs there were girls and
girls black-eyed girls who laughed a
great deal and were proud of their
clothes just as every girl under the
sun is proud of her holiday finery
coquetting under their close-drawn lace
mantillas sending swift glances here
and there seeking fresh conquests

  but none of them looked like anita
montoya he gave each slim shape
the second glance to make sure and
he returned a smile or two and got
a hostile male glance or two that proved
he was considered sufficiently danger-
ous when the kid went over to the
place of music he had an extra little
swagger in his walk and the conviction
that he could have all kinds of part-
ners if he wanted them but he was
faithful to his tryst he was still look-
ing for anita

  he saw general ortega-or so he
judged from the deference paid the
man and the swift spanish greetings
as he passed through the crowd-and
he was surprised to find him not at all
a splendid person but a very ordinary
individual whose insignia of rank
seemed to consist chiefly of the broad
band of red and white which he wore
on his hat still he did not see anita
he went inside the place of music and
stood a moment just within the door

soldiers circling past with senoritas
smiling on their arms glanced at him
sharply from under broad hat brims
on the benches and chairs ranged
around the wall sat others who also
gave him sharp glances of appraise-
ment he could not see the faces of
these the serapes were for the most
part drawn up to the coal-black un-
friendly eyes hiding the features as a
turkish beauty hides her charms

  it seemed to the kid that he was
rather conspicuous standing there by
the door and he moved a few feet to
one side and sat down at a little round
table-of which there were many-
with his back to the wall and his
round boyish face to the crowd and his
eyes always seeking for anita montoya

  a man came negligently toward him
-a man well-muscled stealthy-eyed
with a jagged white scar on his left
cheek bone the kid looked at him
with that betraying widened glance
which he would have to outgrow if he
ever meant to hide his feelings success-
fully jim lyons shot him an oblique
glance which had in it something coldly
malevolent and sat down at the next
table-also with his back to the wall
and his face to the swirling crowd the
kid braced himself mentally against
the malevolence and with his foot he
gently moved a chair that might be in
his way if he should want to make a
dash for the door jim lyons he
knew need only speak one word in the
ear of one of those swarthy-skinned
fellows and he would have no leisure
for anita montoya even though she
might stand before him

  jim lyons hand that bill gillis had
seared with a bullet when the hand had
been lifted for a treacherous blow at
the kid was no longer in a sling the
kid noticed that though it was still
bandaged he could use it a little then
since lyons made no hostile move he
went on looking for anita

  presently from ont the crowd of
the popular magazine

dancers she came swaying her lips
curved in a smile that was not for
him but for her partner her black eyes
turning here and there to greet those
she knew among the onlookers the
kid forgot all about jim lyons all
about those strange silent watchers
who masked their faces with bright-
hued serapes and let no little thing es-
cape their sharp eyes as the girl
danced nearer and nearer the kid half
rose from his chair then she saw
him and he settled back against the
wall because of something he had read
in her face

  her hand that held a fan half closed
against his shoulder guided her cava-
lier toward the table she stopped
there with a swift murmur of spanish
words to her partner both hands she
pressed upon the table and looked
straight into vans eyes she was not
smiling

  but you should not have come here
you foolish boy she said softly but
with a certain fierce reproach i was
joking when i asked you i tried to
see you again to tell you not to come

  you asked me van told her
bluntly you said you would learn
me the spanish waltz

  i will not dance with you what
a fool to come here-you  i thought
you would know better if you have
any sense you will go back as quick
as your horse can take you

  im going to dance said the kid
stubbornly if you wont dance with
me ill dance with some other girl
theres plenty i can get

  go back i tell you no one will
dance with you she had spoken so
swiftly that no more than a minute was
gone into the past since she stopped
at the table she had spoken so low
that even jim lyons sitting near and
openly listening could catch only a
word here and there she had spoken
so fiercely that the kid was bewildered
by her antagonism

  his eyes went to the bracelet of sil-
ver which he had found and had wished
on to her arm it had slipped down
over her hand-and it was then he no-
ticed how her hands were trembling
and her arms as though she was shiv-
ering with cold though that could npt
be since the room was suffocatingly
warm he looked up at her and his
eyes went farther to the face of her
escort that individual had just laid
hand to her shoulder and was pulling
her away with a quick sentence m his
native tongue in his voice was hot
male anger in his eyes was the fighting
flame

  beat it came sharply to the ears
of the kid he did not know who it
was that spoke-certainly not anita
for she was looking into the face of
her cavalier and she was answering in

 	o

spanish what he had said-explaining
it would seem why she had stopped to
speak to this young gringo

  the heart-twisting plaintiveness of
the spanish music with its voluptuous
pulsing accompaniment steeped the
whole scene in a sense of unreality it
was like a play with an orchestra play-
ing beyond the footlights-

  and then came the bedecked one who
had listened at the boundary and had
made haste to ride after he stood
within the door looking here and there
until he caught sight of the kid then
he started forward and he named the
name of the texas rangers as he came
on it takes so little to fire the blood
of a people already war mad and full
of rebellion against the powers that be
that a dozen men started up cursing
at the word

  the kid had listened well to the
tales bill gillis had told him listened
also to the others who had talked to-
gether around their supper fire in the
hollow of the grove while their com-
rades stood guard a short rifle shot
away and now unconsciously summing
up the wisdom he had gained there he
five hundrbd head for a ranger



acted automatically as any one of them
would have acted in such an emergency

  he sprang up with his chair in his
hands and let it fly with a swinging
sweep that caught the bedecked one and
two or three others and sent them
staggering back against the crowd by
the time they got their balance the kid
was at the doorway and through it into
the street as he went by jim lyons
jumped up with an oathrlmd flung an
impeding table out of his way with
his gun in his hand and a threat on
his lips he slammed the two tables
together as he lunged at the kid

  but as it happened one table tilted
square across the open doorway and
the foot of jim lyons caught a leg of
it and in pulling free he turned it so
that the table jammed there in the door
the crowd did the rest piling in and
holding one another back in their very
great haste to get out it was cleverly
done not one of those serape-draped
fighters suspected that jim lyons was
not doing his best to kill the kid
while they fumbled the table and
jammed this way and that against it
they believed that the kid had no friend
on that side of the border

burtons one funny story

theodore e burton of ohio at this waiting a possibility for the
republican presidential nomination is a man who devotes himself almost
entirely to studious thoughts and to the delivery of weighty opinions on im-
portant subjects a man who has been closely associated with him for many
years says that he never heard mr burton tell but one anecdote here it is
with the circumstances which occasioned it

    when burton was chairman of the committee on rivers and harbors in
the house of representatives a delegation which appeared before him to ask
an appropriation for the improvement of a certain river was peremptorily re-
fused after the committee meeting one of the members of the delegation
tried to argue with burton in an effort to make him change his mind

    you ought to be satisfied that you know exactly where you stand replied
burton ive not attempted to mislead you in any way that reminds me of
a man named einstein in cleveland he went to see his friend jacobs and
asked for the loan of a thousand dollars jacobs somewhat reluctantly gave
up the thousand the next day announcement was made that einstein had
gone into bankruptcy jacobs on reading the list of preferred creditors saw
that he was not among them greatly alarmed he rushed around to see
einstein

     what does this mean einstein he demanded yesterday i loaned you
a thousand dollars and to-day you fail and dont even put my name among the
preferred creditors

     dont wtorry jacobs replied einstein reassuringly those other fellows
who are named preferred creditors-you are better off than they they think
theyre going to get their money you know right now you aint

    so you see concluded burton im doing as einstein did to jacobs im
not leaving you in suspense
 the mystery of the wheel chair

by george woodruff johnston
author of  the ordeal  ithe hidden clew  etc

   thi strange circumstances surrounding the death of a political boss at
a seaside town whose bathing beach is the finest and whose municipal
government is unquestionably the rottenest of any place on the coast

he was layin back in that wheel
chair right alongside of me
looking as comfortable as you
please explained morsch the
shifty political go-between wetting his
thin lips with a restless tongue id
just roused up myself and thought he
hadnt finished out his nap wake
up crudy says i its mornin
but he didnt take no notice then i
give him a shove but that wasnt no
good either still i didnt suspicion
anything yunderstand i kep on
thinking he was asleep and it wasnt
till id laid my hand on him that i
got wise it felt wet-wet and warm
and sticky the lamps along the board
walk had been turned off but day had
broke over the ocean and it was light
enough for me to see what had made
my hand feel that way but i didnt
need to see theres only one thing
in the whole world that could have
done it thats blood and at last i
knew why i couldnt wake crtidy
hed croaked 

be he sighed ruefully or a thing
like this wouldnt have got my nerve
i guess im growin old thats what

  he looked it in the pale midsum-
mer dawn which stole through the open
windows of the hotel baggage room
where we were gathered his ferretlike
face showred pinched and gray his
small body seemed bent and shriveled
he sat huddled on a trunk he
couldnt keep still his gaze wandered
fitfully about but upon whomsoever
it chanced to fall whether upon the
manager of the house the night clerk
or myself it swiftly and surely swung
back to the rolling chair standing in
the middle of the floor with the dead
body of phillipus crudy the up-state
boss slumped upon its cushions

 suddenly morsch jumped up and
started to leave the room but before
he could do so the manager stepped
quickly to the door locked it and put
the key in his pocket with that the
politician scowled threw away th
stump of his cigar and turned on him

  morsch had begun his recital with
an air of cynical bravado he ended
it with a shudder then he replaced
between his teeth the frayed stump of
a cigar long since grown cold took
off his panama hat and wtiped his
moist forehead with a big silk hand-
kerchief i aint the man i used to

savagely damn it cardiff what do
you mean take that chair away or
else let me out of here ive had
moren enough already sleeping all
night in that infernal thing with him
leaning up against me its worse than
the tremens just to look at him

  it is is it challenged cardiff the
the mystery of the wheel chhr



manager losing his temper then
why did you bring him here what
do you suppose is going to happen
when my guests come down to break-
fast itll cheer them up a whole lot
wont it to hear theres a dead man
in the trunk room and to see the
morgue wagon waiting at the door
what were you thinking about any-
way morsch did you want to ruin
my house 

  what else was i to do the go-
between snapped back wasnt him
and his new wife stoppin here i
couldnt leave him stranded out there
on the board walk could i  supposin
i had-the whole thing would have
been blowed all over town in-half an
hour

  well how are you going to keep
it from getting out as it stands now
demanded the unmollified cardiff
youve dragged him in here what
are you going to do writh him get
busy morsch youve put me in a
box now get me out of it and do it
quick you shant sneak through that
door and leave me to do all the ex-
plaining

  there wont be no explainin to do
easiest thing in the world to shut the
matter up blustered the little man

  how id like to know

  the politician had slid his hand be-
hind him and he now pulled a roll of
bank notes out of his hip pocket and
held it so that it was visible to me
but not to the others i guess doctor
dannarts seen a lot of suicides in his
day he suggested meaningly how
about it doc

  i smiled i knew morsch for the
past twenty years i had been spending
a part of my summer holidays in this
seaside city whose bathing beach is
probably the finest and whose munic-
ipal government is unquestionably the
rottenest of any place on  the coast
and i had both heard much of and
had met the diminutive politician who

often ran down from the capital it
was understood to bring the blackmail
levied by the local gang upon every out-
of-town corporation doing business
writh the shore crudy also i had no-
ticed about the hotel every now and
then but i had never known who he
was until some fifteen minutes before
when the manager had sent up to wake
me and to ask if i would come down
to the baggage room to see a man
who had been shot i had found crudy
already dead a bullet had entered his
body just below the right collar bone
and had left it at the lower edge of
the shoulder blade of the opposite side
hemorrhage largely internal had
killed him in short order

  suicides surely said i reply-
ing to morschs insidious question
ive seen a good many suicides but
this was something different absolutely
different

  what then he quavered

  murder i flung back at him
willful murder

  murder  once more the politi-
cians roaming glance swept back to
the rolling chair he winced and
paled he seemed indeed almost on
the border of collapse but in an as-
tonishingly short time he got a fresh
grip upon himself i guess you must
be mistaken about that doc im sure
you are think again he coaxed dis-
playing his roll a little more conspicu-
ously

  if i am mistaken i retorted more
amused than angered by his shameless
effrontery ive come across this morn-
ing i believe the only man who ever
shot himself in that particular part of
the body--a site as unusual for a self-
inflicted wound of this kind as the
regions about the heart and brain are
common no theres nothing in
your suggestion mr morsch and you
may put away the bank roll with which
you are trying to induce me to accept
it


the populzr mzgzzinb

  all the same you cant prove he
didnt croak himself the go-between
argued sullenly the gun he used
was lying at his feet in the bottom of
the chair

  granted i smiled but if crudy
committed suicide wrhile beside you the
mere shock of the explosion would
have brought you up standing fur-
thermore there are no powder marks
on his body and while we do have
soundless guns nowadays theres no
such thing as a vanishing bullet-yet
if the man killed himself in the chair
wheres the ball that did it it isnt
in his body for it made a wound of
exit it isnt in the chair and that it
didnt go through the chair you can
see for yourself your theory is an
interesting one mr morsch but it pre-
supposes that the boss shot himself to
death elsewhere and then strolled along
the board walk climbed into the chair
and calmly sat down by you while you
slept you can scarcely expect us to
credit that can you 

  no i continued examining the
weapon which as the politician said
had been found on the floor of the chair
after he had wheeled it back to the
hotel no this pistol may have been
the one used to kill crudy but the
hand that held it was not his owri
that much is certain

  the go-between fidgeted about on
the trunk upon which he was again
seated he put his roll of bills away
and once more fell to mopping his head
with his handkerchief

  humph he ejaculated frowning
perplexedly  now you mention it it
does look as if some one else done it
and not in the chair either but i cant
quite figure it out wed been in-cru-
dys rooms me and some other fellows
and when we broke up after midnight
the boss said he would see me to my
hotel well we was all considerable
lit up and when the tvvo of us got
into a chair on the board walk we

told the attendant to leave us by the
outer rail sos we could cool off we
were both in the chair when i dropped
asleep and we were still there when i
woke up at daybreak according to
your say-so doc somebody must have
lifted crudy out of the chair carried
him away somewhere shot him and
brought his body back and dumped it
down beside me who the devil would
have made a fool play like that it
sounds almost crazy enough for a
woman oh that reminds me he in-
terrupted himself what are we goin
to do about the boss wife or least-
ways his widowr whos goin to tell
her about this business

  dont worry ill attend to that
cardiff spoke up then for a long time
he stared in silence at the little go-be-
tween and finally turned to me doc-
tor dannart ive heard a good deal
about your skill in the investigation of
criminal cases will you take charge
of this one after what youve said
i see we cant shut it up its bound
to become public in the end but if
i notify the police now theyre sure to
bungle it and the reporters will be
roosting all over my place like crows
on a straw stack you and your family
have been with me every summer for
years and if youll kindly undertake
the job i know i can depend on you
to keep this hotel out of the mess if
such a thing is possible

  all right i agreed but well
have to send for the coroner

  the coroner morsch burst out
springing to his feet not him not
pynket

  whats the trouble i queried is
he leaky

  no the politician answered hes
just the other way about hes too
close-mouthed and is as obstinate as
a mule besides hes greedy hes
bound to get us going or coming hell
either refuse to keep this matter dark
or hell soak us good and plenty for
the mystery of the wheel chair	

doin it-theres no telling which of
course hes one of the boys he
wouldnt hold office if he wasnt hes
popular and pulls the votes but be-
jieve me hes terrible hard to manage
no just cut out pynket please

  what do you say cardiff i asked
for my part its the coroner or i
quit right now i dont live in this
state but wherever i am f intend to
obey the laws and anyway you put
it this is a coroners case

  i havent much use for pynket doc-
tor  but whatever you suggest goes
the manager replied

  no it dont not here morsch
protested violently

  mr morsch i observed quietly
recalling the bank notes with which he
had tried to buy me a little less talk
from you would be appreciated be
patient your time will come and
when it does youll have enough ex-
planations to make to keep you busy

  this remark of mine had a wholly
unexpected effect instead of the flare-
up i had anticipated the go-between
gazed at me furtively and without an-
other word sat down again and began
to smooth out with unsteady hands the
wrinkles in his disheveled pongee suit

  during the next half hour i did a lot
of work and by the time the rising
sun showed well above the horizon i
had reconstructed the crime and to all
intents and purposes had solved the
mystery surrounding it true i was
still hazy as to the motive which had
prompted the murder and was wholly
ignorant of the identity of the mur-
derer but these questions which by
most would be regarded as of the high-
est importance i knew from experi-
ence to be mere matters of detail that
could be cleared up without difficulty
when the proper time arrived

  it seemed however that i should be
compelled to rely upon circumstantial
evidence alone on the board walk i
met the chair attendant hunting for
na

his vanished chair but he who next
to morsch appeared to be the one most
likely to have seen or heard something
of the tragedy protested that he had
been asleep under the walk and knew
nothing of it

  my investigations finished i re-
turned to the hotel and as i mounted
the stairs which led upward from the
beach level to a broad porch that sur-
rounded the entire building i saw a
woman just beginning to descend them
she was slight and girlish of figure
was heavily veiled and carried in her
hand a small traveling bag no sooner
did she catch sight of me that she
started turned quickly ran along the
porch and hurried down another flight
of steps at the opposite end of the
structure but i was there before her
and at their foot i blocked her way

  mrs crudy said i composedly
im lucky to have caught you my
name is dannart-doctor dannart-
one of your fellow guests here at the
hotel

  i waited in some suspense to learn
if indeed this were the widow of the
murdered man as i have said her
face was hid but in height form car-
riage and style of dress she reminded
me strongly of the person i had occa-
sionally glimpsed in the dining room
and about the porches with crudy
yet of her identity i was far from
certain

  at my words the woman had shrunk
back had then tried to elude me and
when i again stepped in her path she
cried  caught what do you mean
by that  let me pass im in a hurry 

  i glanced at the satchel in her hand
theres no need of hurry i assured
her that is if you wish to take a
train out of town do you

  no then after a pause she
murmured hesitatingly y-e-s have
i time 

  you are too late for the earliest
train i replied and the next one does


the cpopulacr magazine

not leave for forty minutes come
and sit down wont you you can
be more comfortable on the porch than
at the station by the bye have you
seen the manager of the hotel this
morning 

  she shook her head

  no then he has something to tell
you something very urgent very vital
he will be glad to learn that i caught
or as i might have said met you be-
fore you left this place its imperative
that you should first bear what he has
to say

  i dont understand the woman ut-
tered sharply but with a perceptible
tremor in her tones you are an ab-
solute stranger to me how dare you
stop me in this way where is the
manager what has he to tell me
its about your husband

  again she drew back as if startled
my husband she breathed

  yes something serious has hap-
pened to him hes badly injured-
dead

i blurted this out with intentional
abruptness my senses on the alert to
note what effect the news would have
dead he-was it an accident 
no he was murdered i an-
swered her

  then a peculiar thing happened in-
stead of displaying any evidence of
dismay or grief mrs crudy-she had
tacitly admitted who she was-stood
silent and motionless peering at me
through her veil presently-appar-
ently oblivious of what she did-she
partly lifted this and i observed that
her pretty young face was disfigured
by an ugly bruise that involved the left
eye and half the cheek below it but
it was not so much this injury which
caught my attention and kept it riveted
upon her features as the changes in
expression that swept over them i
could not distinguish and interpret all
of these they were too varied and fol-
lowed each other far too quickly- but

if i ever saw infinite relief pictured on
a human face it was visible on hers
while swiftly succeeding it appeared
uncertainty anxiety and fright

  at this moment a motor car swung
round the corner and drew up at the
curb out of it sprang the manager
and after him a big brawny man with
a heavy jaw and deep-set piercing
black eyes

  this is the coroner doctor dan-
nart cardiff began to save time i
went for him myself and as we came
along i told him all weve found out
so far shall we go up to my office
he says hell view the body later on
if an inquest proves necessary but
whos this he queried glancing at the
woman beside me who had again let
fall her veil

  its mrs crudy i replied

  scarcely had i mentioned her name
however than the widow slipped past
us hopped into cardiffs car and tried
frantically to get it started

  the coroner shot one look at her
and seemed instantly to take in the en-
tire situation stop he thundered
do you hear me woman none of
that i need you 

  that was enough mrs crudy heard
the stern command dismounted from
the machine and submissively followed
the rest of us up the stairs and into
the managers private office i under-
stood now why morsch that tawdry
little politician himself a composite of
craft bluster and cowardice should
distrust and fear this stalwart man
with his dominant compelling manner
and few sledge-hammer words

  once in cardiffs room where we
had instructed the night clerk to take
morsch and guard him the coroner
fixed mrs crudy with his penetrating
eyes and without a moments delay
began hurling questions at her that
were as swift and hard as bullets

  your man shot eh you trying
the mystery of the wheel chai



to make a get-away lift your veil
hello  who beat you up 

  the girl-for she seemed hardiy
more than that-shuddered and cow-
ered lower in the chair into which
on entering the room she had sunk de-
jectedly he did she murmured

  crudy you cant mean crudy
the coroner sneered dont tell me
that a fine gentleman like the boss-
he give a lady a black eye i cant
believe it

  the insolent irony of these remarks
seemed entirely lost on the young
widow apparently she sensed in them
only a defense of her late husband
and this brought her to her feet her
face flushed her eyes flaming her
bosom heaving tumultuously

  but he did she cried yes and
he did worse he fooled me tricked
me he pretended to be a decent law-
yer but was nothing but a low dis-
reputable politician he told me he
was well off and so he was-with
money he had swindled and black-
mailed other people out of he lied
to me cheated me until at last he got
his clutches on every cent i owned
he swore he loved me but he didnt
all he loved was my property all he
wanted of me was to use me in his
shady schemes oh and i trusted
him

  the coroner burst into a roar of
laughter say you never trusted
crudy did you and with money
too gosh you were an easy mark

  if it were pynkets purpose to fan
to fury her resentment against the dead
boss and thus goad her on to make
some betrayal of herself he was suc-
ceeding admirably

  i was an easy mark she responded
bitterly we were married more
than six months ago and i never even
guessed what sort of man he was until
last night then he grew careless he
gave a supper in our suite he asked
his real friends-the kind hed always

kept out of my sight such friends as
i didnt know he had-and he drank
too much and talked my bedroom is
next to the room where the supper
was and i listened and heard him
before he went home with you she
wheeled about and glared at morsch
he came in to me he wanted to kiss
me good-by it makes my blood boil
to think of it but when i told him
what i had learned about him from
his own lips and vowed i would leave
him he struck me in the face and
knocked me down

  and then you killed him did you
the coroner ripped out

  the girl blanched and caught hold
of the tablenear which she had been
standing too late she saw the trap
into which pynket had jockeyed her
how he had led her on to saddle herself
with a motive for the crime but in
an instant she regained her spirit and
her face reddened angrily

  no she cried but if id had the
pluck i would have done it instead
of that i got up and ran and locked
myself in the bathroom and hid there
all night expecting every moment that
he wrould come back i didnt know
he was dead until the doctor here
stopped me just now when i was hurry-
ing to get the first train out of town
then-well i confess it-i thought i
might be suspected-i was frightened
-i jumped into mr cardiffs car-

  thatll do the coroner interrupted
roughly you women all tell the same
story youre always saints the men
sinners he waved his huge mus-
cular hand as though to sweep aside
every statement she had made save one
and this he immediately cast back at
her

  your husband talked did he
what did he say-not about you but
about other things

  let up on that pynket morsch
pleaded you were in it you heard
what was said about them other


the vovulacr magazine

things forget em you shouldnt
tattle out of school

  mrs crudys brows lifted in aston-
ishment oh were you there too
mr coroner that accounts for it
i have been trying to remember where
i had heard your voice before so
you were one of them were you one
of mr crudys precious friends whom
he kept hid from me so long

  the coroner paid not the least atten-
tion either to the widows questions
or to the go-betweens behests

  go on answer me  he ordered
mrs crudy and be careful what
you say some day you may have to
repeat it under oath in court remem-
ber i have the law at my back

  well this is how it began she
explained her eyes snapping mr
morsch had brought down one hundred
thousand dollars from the city it was
bribe money to pay for a franchise
granted here but whats the use of
my telling you mr morsch has just
said you were present at the supper
and heard all about it

  never mind what i heard the cor-
oner retorted its what you heard
that im after

  i shouldnt think any decent man
would care to have me repeat that the
widow said contemptuously but if
you insist i will i heard mr crudy
and his friends snarling over that
money like dogs over a bone but no
one said as little or in the end gat as
much of it as mr crudy himself nat-
urally this satisfied nobody-except mr
crudy but what could they do
nothing he was their master he
not only knew how to strike a woman
and cheat her out of her property but
he was able to rob men and yet whip
them into line of course a good deal
went on that i did not understand but
one thing was plain however much
his friends might hate and distrust each
other they loathed and feared him
more oh they were a fine crowd

ive read of such people but until last
night i never believed they existed or
could exist

  mrs crudy flung these words at her
inquisitor with brutal frankness and
in this disclosing what she had learned
she seemed to find a salve for her
wounded pride and a measure of com-
pensation for the humiliations she had
suffered it was not the pretty and
doubtless lovable young woman stand-
ing before us -who in reality was
speaking but rather decent woman-
hood disillusioned in marriage and re-
volted at the filthy sodden slough of
politics in which it had so suddenly
found itself immersed

  when she had finished the coroner
leaned forward his elbows on the table
his eyes transfixing her was that
all he demanded harshly v
no mrs crudy answered my
husband accused that man--

  thats a lie whined morsch i
know what shes goin to say but it
never happened

 my husband accused that man
morsch she went on unflinchingly of
receiving not one hundred but one
hundred and fifteen thousand dollars
from the railroad or whatever else it
was that got the franchise and of plan-
ning to hold on to the odd fifteen thou-
sand himself without saying a word
about it to anybody mr crudy told
morsch that if he would give him ten
thousand of this extra money he would
keep his secret otherwise he would
drum him out of the party and ruin
him

  prove that you heard that pynket
challenged he had dropped his brow-
beating methods now and spoke
slowly incisively and obviously in
deadly earnest

  how 

  crudy never used those high-toned
words give him keep his secret
drum him out of the party what did
he say
the mystery of the wheel chalr



  mrs crudy wrinkled her brows
once he said come across  she re-
plied hesitatingly he called money
kale at another place he swore hed
put the red bean in somebodys ear
-i dont know what he meant by that
the coroner grinned thats the
boss all right youve told the truth
i know whose ear he wanted to put
the red bean in now what next
next they quarreled

  are you sure would you swear
to that on the witness stand

  of course im sure they sat close
by the door those two it was open
a little way i stood behind the por-
tieres on the other side and heard every
word they said

 and then-

  then as it got later and they drank
more they made up though only half-
heartedly finally my husband got to
bragging to mr morsch about what a
smart man he was-how foxy he
called it-and to prove it he told him
about me oh why didnt i kill him
then and there

  never mind about you the coro-
ner interposed did crudy get his
money 

  i dont know

  pynket whipped round to me what
did you find in the boss pockets or
didnt you look

  i examined them the manager in-
tervened there was no money in
them

  i give him the stuff i swear i did
groaned morsch i seen him put it
in his pants pocket it was in thou-
sands-ten of them i kep the num-
bers  theres never any tellin whatll
happen

  what have you got in yours shell
out commanded the coroner

morsch hung back until pynket
hoisted himself from his chair and
started toward him then he threw
his roll on to the table in front of me
how much asked the coroner

 i counted the money fifteen
thousand and thirty-seven dollars
instantly his tormentor turned on the
little go-between

  you said just now morsch that
you had split with crudy how comes
it then that hes got nothing on him
while you can show the whole of that
extra fifteen thousand you soaked
those parties in the city how about
it i say how did that ten thousand
hop back from the boss pocket into
yours 

  morsch spluttered mopped his head
grew garrulous he explained and re-
explained that whereas five of the fif-
teen thousand dollars in his possession
did constitute part of the additional
sum he had grafted from the railroad
people the remaining ten thousand
was his own had nothing to do with
the rest and most positively was not
the ten thousand out of which crudy
had bunkoed him

  it looks to me as if you thought i
done the boss he wailed but i
didnt know a thing about it till 
waked up and felt that wet sticky

stuff-

  wheres the gun the coroner
broke in addressing cardiff

  the manager produced the weapon
from his safe and laid it on the table

  is that yours morsch pynket in-
terrogated

  no i never toted a revolver in my
life i can prove it

  whose is it then

  mrs crudy looked closely at the
pistol and touched it gingerly with the
tips of her fingers i recognize it
she averred it belonged to my hus-
band i never knew why he carried a
revolver until i learned last night what
sort of people he ran with

  theres one of them cried the
coroner frowning viciously at the go-
between and thumping the table with
his big fist own up morsch you
took the gun from his pocket while lie


the popular magazine

was asleep you shot him with it and
then you robbed him of the money hed
forced you to split with him

  pynket broke the revolver put his
eye to the muzzle and squinted into
the barrel then he swung the cyl-
inder around with his thumb

 look he added passing the
weapon to me one shot has been
fired and only one crudy got that
besides the smudge in the barrels
fresh come morsch the games
up he turned to the hotel manager
ill phone for a couple of plain-
clothes men if you dont mind car-
diff

  i do mind a whole lot the latter
objected excitedly

  pynket stopped on his way to the
telephone oh i see you dont
want any fuss around the hotel is
that it  i can fix that easy enough
bracelets on behind his back a light
overcoat over his shoulders to hide
them and then your car peoplell
think its an early golf party motoring
out to the links

  the coroner reached the instrument
and laid his hand on the receiver it
was a ticklish moment for morsch

  hold on mr coroner i cried as
he called out the number he desired
theres no smudge here this barrel
is as clean as a whistle

  pynket spoke no further into the
telephone but spun round and faced
me

  what he exclaimed i guess i
know what im talking about

  it may be i admitted respectfully
and i dont profess to share your ex-
pert knowledge of firearms but nev-
ertheless in my judgment this revolver
would look smokier dirtier if it had
been fired off even once within the
past six hours to be frank with you
if i am called as a witness at the in-
quest held over crudys body i shall
feel compelled to testify that to the
best of my knowledge and belief this

is not the weapon with which he was
killed and if such an opinion should
prevail the whole case you have so
skillfully built up against mr morsch
would fall to the ground still im
open to conviction show me a per-
fectly clean weapon to compare with
this one-by the way cardiff have you
got such a thing about

  no the manager replied

  i shrugged my shoulders and laid
crudys pistol upon the table

  heres one you babe in the woods 
pynket laughed drawing from his
pocket a revolver of the same caliber
as the boss and offering it to me
just take a look at the insides of the
barrels of those two guns crudys and
mine and youll see the difference in
a minute

  i broke his weapon glanced at the
muzzle and at the ends of every car-
tridge in the cylinder and clamped the
barrel down again

  well i guess youve seen enough
to convince you eh  the coroner
smiled scornfully reaching out for his
revolver

  yes i replied calmly i have seen
enough to convince me

  then without an instants warning
i leveled the pistol at his stomach

  hands up pynket i cried or ill
fire i arrest you for the murder of
boss crudy

  i had been overconfident had after
all misjudged my man the last word
i uttered had barely passed my lips
when he fell upon me like a thunder-
bolt and before i knew what had hap-
pened he had knocked the revolver
from my grasp and i lay flat on my
back with his huge hands gripping my
throat

  for a moment i was helpless and
had it not been for my knowledge of
anatomy i should have been strangled
to death before the others had recov-
ered their senses and come to my re-
lief with a violent effort i threw into
the mystery of the wheel chjhr



play the powerful muscles which de-
press the lower jaw and thus forced
mine down until the point of my chin
was almost in contact with the top of
my breastbone this maneuver dis-
lodged the coroners viselike clutch
upon my throat again and again he
tried to jam my head backward that
he might recover it but his efforts
were futile the windpipe lay safe be-
hind the strong wedge-shaped barrier
of the under jawbone a barrier that
despite his enormous strength he could
neither thrust aside nor crush

  then his hands being busy and mine
free i gripped his head with all the
power i could summon and bored the
ends of my thumbs into the two little
pits-one near the inner end of the
bony arch that roofs each eye-through
which two nerves emerge from the in-
terior of the skull as every surgeon
knows squeezing these sensitive nerves
against the unyielding bone beneath
produces pain which is simply intolera-
ble so it proved now and in less
than two minutes i had pynket sub-
dued and laid out face downward on
the floor where i held him while car-
diff bound his wrists together behind
his back with the first thing suitable
that came to hand-some tough insu-
lated wire from an electric fan

  better tie up his legs also i sug-
gested as soon as i had sufficiently re-
covered my breath ive had all the
exercise i want before breakfast

  with this i relaxed my hold on the
mans head and glanced about me the
room seemed all at once to have be-
come profoundly still at her former
place beside the table stood mrs crudy
looking very white and gazing at pyn-
ket and me with astonished eyes

  our prisoner now secured i turned
him over on his back and searched his
pockets for me it was an anxious
moment would i find therein that
which i sought or had i gone too far
and laid myself open to arrest for un-

provoked assault and to a ruinous suit
for damages at last i grasped some-
thing in my hand i drew it forth i
glanced at it nervously then assuredly
then jubilantly

  there mr coroner i cried dis-
playing what i held so that he might
clearly see it there is the final
strand needed to weave the rope thats
going to hang you-a roll containing
ten one-thousand-dollar bank notes the
exact amount and in the precise form
mind you that morsch declares he was
compelled to give up to crudy as the
price of his silence but wait
morsch didnt you say you had the
numbers of these bills read them
aloud

  the go-between removed a slip of
paper hidden behind his hatband and
called off the figures written thereon
these at my request cardiff checked
with the numbers of the notes i had
discovered in pynkets pocket they
were identical

  you may wish to know mr cor-
oner i remarked how i learned that
you had this money and found out
the way in which you got it ill tell
you you were watching you saw
the boss leave morsch asleep in the
rolling chair you followed him until
he reached a certain desolate ill-
lighted spot a spot midway and in a
direct line between his starting point
and his probable destination-the turk-
ish baths which are located near the
beach and some three hundred yards
from this hotel there you confronted
him you demanded this hush money
he refused to give it up and you there-
upon killed him and robbed him of it

  pynket his massive jaws clenched
his piercing eyes roving about the room
now stabbing me now searching for
some possible means of escape lay on
the floor apparently deaf to what i was
saying

  to find that spot i nevertheless
went on was an easy task taking


the cpopulacr magazine

as a center the place on the board walk
where the wheel chair had stood i
moved around it in ever-widening
spirals until i discovered what i was
after-blood it lay on the planks of
a narrow footway crossing the sands
and nowhere in the neighborhood was
either a bench or a chair to be seen
this last is all important for it leads
to the inference that crudy was stand-
ing or walking and was not sitting
down when shot

  the course of the bullet within the
body remember was from above down-
ward it is fair to assume that it trav-
eled in the same direction before it
struck the body that is to say was
fired downward at crudy by some one
standing over him of course if
crudy happened to be seated at the
critical moment anybody standing up
would have overtopped him for in-
stance a man as short as morsch or
a woman of mrs crudys height but
he was on his feet and therefore a
downward-moving ball to have entered
his body as high up as this one did
must necessarily have come from a
point considerably above him which
means that he was shot by a person
much taller than he hence by some one
far exceeding the average in stature
not morsch not mrs crudy but you
mr coroner are such a person

  again there was no sand nor any
scratch tear or abrasion on or about
the boss clothes or shoes from this
it follows that his body was not
dragged but was carried back to the
wheel chair could morsch could mrs
crudy have done that no only an
exceptionally strong man a man like
yourself pynket would have been
equal to such a job

  now as to your motive mrs
crudy has said that no one in that room
last night was satisfied with his share
of the plunder there distributed and
she added that all present loathed and
feared her husband domineering

avaricious and conscienceless as this
wretched go-between has told us you
are mr coroner and forceful and
capable as we have seen you to be it
is not hard to imagine how you of all
others must have resented being bossed
by crudy or by anybody else and how
especially you must have raged at be-
ing euchred by these two fellow ban-
dits out of a share in this precious
windfalls-this extra fifteen thousand
dollars of blackmail you hated crudy
you have practically admitted that it
was you he had in mind when he threat-
ened to put the red bean in somebodys
ear which signified that he purposed
to get you at the first opportunity
you likewise hated morsch and after
you had shot the boss a brilliant
thought occurred to you you would
make it appear that morsch had killed
crudy and thus be revenged on both
as i said this the coroner raised
up his head and struggled fiercely to
be free but his bonds held and he
sank back infuriated at his helplessness
thereupon i continued imperturbably
in your cross-examination of mrs
crudy pynket you showed how plau-
sible such an idea could be made to
seem solely from the evidence you so
deftly extracted from her but in exe-
cuting your plan you did the most fool-
ish thing of which one could possibly
conceive--just such an act of folly as
every criminal appears foreordained to
perform in one shape or another at
such a crisis after shooting the boss
what did you do you took the ex-
ploded shell out of your revolver and
put it into the one he had carried and
with an unexploded cartridge from his
weapon you filled the chamber thus
made vacant in your own then you
threw crudys pistol-with one ball
missing-into the rolling chair in which
you laid the body that was a fine
stroke together with mrs crudys
story of the quarrel between her hus-
band and morsch and the other facts
the mystery of the wheel chilcr



you elicited from her this made the
case against the latter look almost im-
pregnable while by cleaning the barrel
of your own revolver you sought to
divert suspicion from yourself

  but you forgot to do one thing
you neglected to examine the two car-
tridges before you exchanged them
had you done so you would have dis-
covered as i did-after i had in-
veigled you into letting me see your
weapon-that whereas they were of the
same caliber they zvere of different
make the tiny letters stamped upon
the brass ring encircling the central
copper cap are in the two shells ab-
solutely unlike in short each re-
volver contains one cartridge taken
from the other but the mates of the
one exploded shell in crudys zveapon
occupy the chambers of your own

  let me hold them out to you mr
coroner in order that you may see
what an extremely painful joke you
played upon yourself when in this art-
less fashion you tried to implicate one
of the choicest spirits of your party
mr morsch in the sudden taking off
of mr crudy the revered boss
thereof

  as i finished speaking cardiff
looked at his watch and then drew me
aside

  doctor said he nervously in ex-
actly twenty minutes the dining-room
doors will open for early breakfast
we started out with one problem--
what to do with crudys body now

we have two more on our hands how
on earth are we going to solve them

  with this he glanced successively at
the coroner and mrs crudy follow-
ing his gaze i observed that the cour-
age and defiance bred of the girls re-
sentment had evaporated and that now
looking quite friendless and forlorn
she leaned back in a chair her eyes
closed wearily her hand nursing her
injured face

  twenty minutes why that gives
us lots of time for everything i re-
assured the manager first as to
mrs crudy shes bruised in body and
in spirit and is utterly worn out ill
phone up to my rooms and in ten min-
utes my wife will be mothering her
crudys body we can get to the morgue
before the first guest comes downstairs
if youll call up the mayor right away
and explain the situation to him and
as for pynket he himself has told us
precisely what to do dont you re-
member what he suggested in regard
to morsch -bracelets on behind his
back a light overcoat over his shoul-
ders to hide them and then your car
as things have turned out it will be
the coroner who will wear the brace-
lets but otherwise his plan can be car-
ried out to the letter and ive no
doubt that as we hustle him to head-
quarters it will be just as he prophe-
sied-people who see us from the hotel
porch if there be any such will think
we are an early golf party starting to
motor out to the links

friend george i guess you
must have sent that twenty by
the erie because i never got
it in pottstown probably it
will pull in there to-morrow all tired
out ch  ill bet they think my
last name is pest at the post-office in
pottstown-i stalled around there all
morning hoping you would send in i
would have slipped you george if you
had needed it like i did to get right
down to it i often have-im not say-
ing this to bring up bygones george
but if you remember you are in me for
 from that box of cigars we give
the manager in bridgeport last year
i guess you must be shy yourself or
i would have the twenty eh george
the guy at the general delivery win-
dow says to me the fifteenth time i
asked him if theres anything for tom
brennan

  are you waiting for the vote on
prohibition or to find out if its a boy
or twins 

  i suppose if i had took a wallop at
him i wouldnt have done myself no
good they would probably have rail-
roaded me for assaulting the u s
government or something eh george
well this here levy didnt answer my
wire until about four oclock in the
afternoon you know how i felt by
that time george i didnt have a nickle
-i thought sure you would come

through with that twenty-did you get
my letter-and as i told you in my
last if you got it i even blew my ticket
to this burg playing seven up with the
hotel clerk after these canfields here
had taken me in a poker game i hope
you have kept all this under your hat
like i told you well by four oclock
im figuring on starting a little three
card monte or something when along
comes this wire from levy i am
copying it off heres what it said

tom brennan agent hercules pottstown
   pennsylvania

  get advance from house manager make
reading or quit	abe levy mgr

  what do you think of a rat like that
eh well i took the wire to jepson
the manager of the opera house and
showed it to him

  aint your show got no money
he says

  money i says why steve l
money himself is behind this film com-
pany this levy guy is a great kidder
hes probably laughing his head off now
for sending me this but i got to go
away from here so just let me take ten
ill give you an i o u and when levy
gets here hell give it to you right
away

  ha  ha  he says you and mr
levy are both ladders aint you i

box office against giving advance men
money fellow came in here ahead of

this series began in the popular for december 
reel stuff



a dog and monkey circus one time and
i let him have two dollars if his
show ever came into this town it must
have been between  and  a m be-
cause i never seen it or him neither
after that

  you see what i was up against
george some crook had got to that
guy and for the rest of his life hell
figure everybody is crooked theres
nothing like being on the level george
unless of course you dont expect to
make the town any more after i had
worked on that jepson guy for an
hour i got him where he let me have
five dollars i tied up my paper then
and came on to reading ill write you
a letter to-morrow and let you know

  dear george  the guy that laid
out the route for this picture must be
getting a cut from the railroad i
wouldnt be surprised if we jumped
from the next burg to sydney aus-
tralia i go from this tank to another
watershed called biddleboro  miles
up the line i finally got some money
from levy in reading he sent me
thirty dollars so i will be able to get
by for about a week now when i
went down to get my paper at the rail-
road station here the baggage man calls
me to one side

  id like to see this here picture mis-
ter he says

  how many i says taking out my
pass book

  well lets see he says cocking one
eye theres me and martha and joe
and freddie and little tommie and
ann-

  wrait a minute i says im not
taking the census-leave room for the
orchestra ill give you a pass for four
thats the limit

  he took the pass as if he was doing
me a favor and ill bet when i went
away he called me a cheap bum or
something eh george that only left
him three to sell see well george
i left reading so warmed up over
hercules that theyll have to throw po-
lice lines around the town when my
picture gets there i was busier than
a one-armed paper hanger all the time
i was there as im a couple of days
late but i made a train out to this cen-
tralia place last night before i left
reading i had supper in the dining
room of the good hotel you know
george that im as loose as ashes
with my money when i have it re-
member how i came through with that
 for you in bridgeport but i
figures that this levy guy is new to
me and i cant take no chances because
im getting further away from times
square every day well when the bis-
cuit shooter left the check at my plate
i took a trial balance and found i was
getting pretty close to the cushion so
i wrote out a pass for two and left
it by the plate i was just going out
the door when she nails me and hands
me the pass

  i guess you forgot this in the ex-
citement she says she held up my
meal check

  oh no i says i left this for
you and i pushes the pass into her
hands

  im not saving autographs this
year she says edging me up to the
cashiers desk that went out long
ago-its silk flags now i never heard


the popular magazine

of hercooles and i dont care to meet
no strange wops if you dont come
through ill call a cop

  well they had me right george a
couple of big huskies come walking
over and i figures its no use starting
anything there-it would only knock
the picture when it came in so i let
them take six bits away from me i
never beat anybody out of a nickle
george if i can help it but i got as
much right to look out for myself as
anybody am i right  thats the
worst of these small-time burgs they
think every strange guy with a clean
collar and a shine is out to trim them
and if you stole the whole town you
couldnt hock it for bean money

  well so long george i hope that
twenty dont get lost following me
abound eh	tom

  friend george well george i
told you i was going to give you the
low down on this hercules guy so i
will tell you about him now while i am
waiting for the train hercules hung
out in rome or some place like that
right after it was built i told you
before what a husky citizen he was
willard couldnt have stayed a round
with him well like all these guys he
fell for a skirt so he went to her old
man and told him about it the old
man was about as strong for hercules
as i am for levy but he dont want to
start nothing knowing hell only get
the worst of it so he says

  all right here you come around
to-morrow and ill give you the ver-
dict 

  so hercules goes away and the old
man stays up all night trying to dope
himself an out finally he draws up a
list of twelve jobs for this hercules
guy to work on and then he turns in
and hits the hay satisfied that hes got
the indian sign on here the next

morning hercules is around bright and
early the old man takes him in the
parlor and gives him a cigar then he
says

  i got a few little things here for
you to do before i can take you on as
a son-in-law

  with that he hands hercules the list
of the twelve jobs we have the same
list on the program and here it is i
copied it off

  strangling the nemean lion

  killing the lernean lydia

  capturing the ceryneian stag

  capturing the erymanthian boar

  cleaning the augean stables

  slaughtering the stymphalian birds

  capturing the cretan bull

  capturing the man-eating mares of dio-
medes

  securing the girdle of hippolyte

  fetching the red oxen of geryon

  getting the golden apples of the hes-
perides

  bringing to the upper world the three-
headed dog cerebus

 some layout eh george well
while hercules is giving this the up and
down the old man is laughing to him-
self and patting himself on the back
for being a bright little fellow heres
where here quits cold he thinks
but somebody had give him a wrong
steer on hercules here gets up and
yawns

  this will be soft for me he says
ill be around in a few days for your
daughter

 another guy would have walloped
the old man and taken a chance id
like to see levy pull something like that
on me and get away with it well
hercules went out and cleaned up on
the old mans list and got his daugh-
ter levy probably wired for the
movie rights as soon as the flash came
that hercules had put it over the old
man

  you can see from this that we have
considerable picture eh george of
course half of it is phony hercules
probably went out and framed up these
reel stuff



lernean lydias and stymphalian birds
and they laid down but he got away
with it and thats the big idea george

  well so long george dont take no
plugged nickles ill write you some
more from ashton pa the next burg

tom

  p s ill bet when i get that twenty
the envelope will be all covered with
addresses eh george	tom

  dear george i just got a letter
from levy saying the picture was a
riot in pottstown and is going to be
held over for two more days i guess
thats bad eh you know i dont like
to hand it to myself but i never met up
with no advance men that had any-
thing on me yet of course levy will
say its the picture but you know your-
self george when you got a live one
ahead you can get by with murder
why ill bet nero wouldnt have got
six people to see the hons and the mar-
tyrs in stock if he hadnt had a good
man doing the press stuff levy didnt
say nothing in his letter about the i o
u i gave the guy in pottstown so i
guess jepson is a good loser and didnt
say anything about it well at the
bottom of levys letter he says this will
be a hard town because a picture called
the dangers of della in six reels
showed here a week ago and might
have killed it dead for us he says this
will be a chance to deliver the goods
and to get out and get busy

  in a burg like this the best place to
start work is the hotel the clerk
knows everybody and he can generally
lean over the counter and call the roll
because most of the anti-suffragettes
are sitting in the lobby reading the
police gazette and keeping the cuspi-
dors in their proper place well after
getting the bill poster busy i takes an
armful of half sheet lithos and goes
back to the hotel

  good morning i says to the clerk
slipping him a pass how many will
the firemen allow in the opera house
well he says it holds oo but
we had  in there at the last odd
fellows benefit-didnt we mr al-
ters  he calls out to an old guy whos
reading the register as if it was a
french novel

  the old guy marks the place with his
finger looks up over his glasses and
misses the cuspidor by a foot

  seven hundred and eighty-nine he
says and goes on reading

  well i says therell be  in
there next week gimme a cigar

  i slides one of the half sheets on
the counter so the clerk could see it
it showed hercules worrying the ne-
mean lion or something like that the
clerk looks at it with no more interest
than if it had been a copy of his uncles
will leaving him all

  looks like some picture he says
finally but we had a moving picture
here last week that was the greatest
thing i ever saw why in one scene
an automobile goes right off a bridge
into a river had three people in it
toor-didnt it mr allers

  the old guy turns over a page in the
register

  four  he says without looking up
well i says we sent that picture
ahead to give you a slight line on this
one this here litho is about the dull-
est scene from the film i showed him
some more theres nearly as many
people in this here picture as there is
in ashton i says the last town
we showed in people stood in line all
night for tickets and thousands were
turned away why the mayor of the
town wrote me such a pitiful letter ask-
ing to see the picture before he died he
had a serious case of barbers itch and
was sinking fast that i took the film
over and gave a special show at the
city hall

 well he says they got a pretty


the vovuur magazine

good crowd at that other picture but
they would have done better but for
one thing

  who was he i says

  if you go out on main street he
says youll see some of their bill-
boards its probably up there yet
one picture shows a horse race and
there are about ten horses in it theyre
supposed to be coming down the
stretch well we all got talking about
it before the picture came here and mr
allers here went up there and studied
the bill board and he saw that a little
black horse was leading so he came
back and made a little bet with council-
man bowes that the little black horse
would win it aint often that mr al-
lers gambles with his money like that
although they say he was a high flyer
in his younger days anyhow he fig-
ured from the way councilman bowes
talked that he hadnt seen the billboard
and that little black horse was so far
ahead that mr allers was willing to
risk his money on it particularly as
they was coming down the stretch

  well they went to the opera house
that night to see the picture all excited
and everything and when the horse
race came along they was only four
horses in it and a white horse with this
della riding it won the race and mr
allers who had bet on the black one
from the billboard lost eighty-five cents
the manager of the picture told him
that the other horses had been dis-
qualified

  well so long george if i get that
twenty i will let you know right away

friend george i would have writ-
ten to you before but i couldnt get no
paper and envelopes in the ashton jail
and i only got out last night i was
there for two days and im lucky i
didnt get sent up for life you know

i told you in my last that levy told
me to get busy in that town because he
thought the other picture would hurt
our business his idea being for me
to dope out a stunt to get the natives
in the opera house when hercules got
there i doped out a stunt all right and
ill bet when this picture hits ashton
theyll have to put the screen up on a
lot because the opera house will never
stand up under the rush for tickets

  the city hall in ashton had a point
on the top like a church steeple and the
opera house is half way down the block
on the other side if they had built
them next door to each other i would
never have been in jail its the first
time i was ever in one except once in
-but that was only for beating a
hotel bill well i worked one whole
day on a scheme to put hercules over
in ashton and finally i hit on a plan
to let them all know hercules would
be in their midst next week i got
the loan of a dummy from a tailor by
giving him a pass for two shows when
i first went in he wanted me to deposit
my right eye for security but i made
him see it my way and got away with
it i wrapped the dummy up and took
it up to my room at the hotel then
i dressed it in an old pair of pants and
hid it in the closet i went over to the
opera house then and dug up the bill
poster which i made into a regular fel-
low by buying him a couple of drinks
i told him my scheme and he said it
was the best thing hed heard of since
prohibition failed to pass the state sen-
ate and he agreed to help me put it
over we went down in the property
room and found a couple of big cow
bells a lot of rope and a half a dozen
roman candles left over from the elec-
tion celebration i took them all back
to the hotel with me and made the bill
poster promise to meet me there at mid-
night

  he was there to the dot i met him
outside and we took the dummy and
reel stuff



the rest of the layout and went over
to the opera house i planted him and
the stuff on the roof while i beat it
over to the city hall found the ladder
where he said it would be and went
to work it was some dark night be-
lieve me george and i might have
broke my neck climbing and fussing
around there in the dark but i finally
got on the roof of the city hall and
fastened the end of rope i was carry-
ing right on the top of that little pointed
steeple the whole burg was sleeping
peacefully and it was so quiet i could
hear the billposter breathing on the roof
of the opera house well i beat it
back to the opera house roof hanging
on to the other end of the rope and we
fastens that end there then we sticks
a roman candle into each of the dum-
mys wooden hands ties the cow bells
where they would do the most good and
put a loop around the whole business
on the line running from the roof to the
city hall steeple i had fixed it so the
dummy would slide slow to the other
end when i started it i hung a sign
around the dummys neck it said
hercules is coming the bill poster
lit the roman candles-and we let her

go

  well george that there dummy slid
along the rope with the bells ringing
and the roman candles sputtering about
as slow as a rifle bullet when it hit
the city hall i thought it was going
over-some of it did-the little point
at the top went away from there but
the dummy stayed noise a charge
of cavalry would have gone unnoticed
alongside of that the crash when the
dummy hit the city hall woke up ash-
ton from one end to the other win-
dows commenced banging up heads
sticking out and i heard a few wild
yells here and there some guy comes
running out of the fire house across the
street with a shot gun in his hand he
didnt have on nothing but a white
nightgown and just as he got set in the

middle of the street the roman candles
opened up a couple of little red balls
bounced off this guys head and he fell
down four times getting back to the
fire house another little blue ball
went through a window of the hotel
and a gang of the towns defenders who
were coming on the run climbed over
each other as the red white and blue
bullets poured into their midst even
though i felt id get the worst of it
george i nearly fell off the roof laugh-
ing the whole town was there by
that time but they were all satisfied to
see the show from the back of the
house the front rows were empty
george friend bill poster was there
too i guess because he had left me
flat when the first candle went off

  george while it lasted it was worth
five dollars of any mans money for a
ringside seat but the dummy was
through when th roman candles gave
out-so was i - crept down through
the opera house to the street and
ducked around in back to the hotel
i sneaked up the fire escape in the back
and finally got in my room i hadnt
been there a minute when i heard them
running up the stairs i jumped into
bed and pretended to be asleep

  come out or ill break down the
door some guy yells through the key
hole

  i got out of bed and walked over to
the window george the census is
wrong when it says there are only
 voters in ashton pa there was
a million anyhow under my window
i figures that levy has been a pretty
good guy to me and its up to me to
help him get his money out of her-
cules so i opened the door if i only
had myself to think of i would have
made them guys step some-im a
pretty bad guy when im right george
you know that yourself

  thats him yells the hotel clerk
pushing through the jam

  wait a minute i says im not


the popular magazine

hercules-hercules is a picture im
the advance agent for it its the great-
est moving picture ever thrown on a

screen why men it cost-

  never mind that the guy with the
sign butts in itll cost you something
before we get through with you come
with me

  well he had a gun george and all
his gang was with him so i went along
they took me over to the jail and threw
me in a cell the next morning i was
brought before a justice of the peace
the s r o sign had been outside the
court house all morning-there wasnt
hardly room for me when we got there

  the judge cleared his throat and
picks up a long piece of paper it
looked like a ticket to frisco on the
erie

  you thomas brennan he says
are this day before me charged with
malicious mischief disorderly conduct
attempted arson in ng a public edi-
fice felonious assault and violating the
curfew law how do you plead 

  all i can say i says is that i
got a lovely future aint i 

  enter a plea of not guilty says
the judge turning to some other guy
you will be tried at the fall term and
meanwhile ill fix bail at  can
you furnish it

  i aint got no change i says can
you break a bill 

  ifake him back says the judge
he called after me as i was being hus-
tled off you had better send for a
lawyer

  one lawyer would be useless to me
i says send them all in

  i hadnt been back in the cell five
minutes when the judge comes in to see
me he chases the keeper away and
pulls me over in a corner of the cell

  not a word he says winking at
me youve done this town a favor

boy although i doubt if you could get
anyone to believe it right now how-
ever i do i have fought this miserly
town council and the picayune mayor
for five years to take the tax surplus
and build a new court house and city
hall to replace the miserable coops that
desecrate the town at present they
pooh poohed me-now on account of
your enterprise theyll have to build
one of them anyhow

  judge i says you are certainly a
regular fellow to look at it like that-
but that aint going to get me nothing

just now-

  early to-morrow morning he says
theres a train stops here long enough
to take on milk if you were at the
railroad station by then do you think
you could board it

  i can beat that judge i says if
you let me out of here ill make it on
the wing

  well george that good old man
shakes my hand and says hell square
everything all around and that the next
morning ill find the door of the coop
unlocked before he went i asked him
if he had seen any of the display the
night before personally

  my boy he says when that pyro-
technic machine gun got in action and
removed the two remaining hairs from
the revered head of our respected fire
chief i laughed so much i like to broke
my fool ribs and he took off his
glasses and wiped his eyes

  well george everything come out
like he said the keeper left the door
open in the morning and i lowered the
track record for the mean distance as
they say to the railroad station i got
the milk train out and called it a day

  ill never take no billposters on my
staff any more george that guy
probably pushed the dummy too hard

synopsis of first part

      at the age of thirty tom warren felt he had gotten nowhere in the world being merely an
ordinary customshouse inspector he provided comfortably for his widowed mother but taking to him-
self a wife under the circumstances was out of the question ruth spencer his sweetheart feared
that tom lacked backbone and ambition so her father thought too old john spencer was a maq of
ability and money and he disliked to think that his daughter had given her heart to a man of small
caliber opium was being smuggled into san francisco in incredible quantities no one seemed to
be able to stop it graham the deputy inspector was under suspicion one day a seeret-serviee agent
from washington comes on to frisco to investigate in  moment of anger and haste tom warren declares
that he could round up the opium ring if he had the chance graves the seeret-service man tells
tom that his wish is granted that he has six months in which to prove his boast with some trepi-
dation at the magnitude of his task warren begins his hunting down of the powerful opium interests
a faithful german karl wemple and a young chap named lind are his trusties at the end of five
weeks tom is on the trail hot-foot lind has observed some queer checking of boxes consigned to one
rhui on a chinese merchant and furthermore karl wemple and tom unearth contraband opium aboard
the steamer mongolia it looks as if shui on were the key to the opium ring and tom and his
helpers are watchful and wary

a two-part novel-part two 

chapter xi

as soon as his seizure of opium
had been safely stowed in the
appraisers building tom
warren hurried back to the
mail dock he had had no sleep but
the fever of the chase was in his blood
the mongolia was to sail the second
day following and if there was any
more of the drug on board he intended
to find it he said nothing to karl
wemple of his interview with lind
tom had little opportunity to talk with
the old inspector alone and besides he
wanted to work this out by himself
wemple had taught him a thing or two
and he was steadily growing more self-
reliant but it would be another little
triumphto spring on karl as a surprise
when the right moment came more-
over wemple had his hands full with
the sear-chers and if necessary they
could thrash out this new problem to-
gether after the liner sailed warren

cisa

was learning the lesson of patience and
was soon to find out that he did have
backbone-despite ruth spencers
assertion to the contrary

  it was close to noon when tom war-
ren and karl wemple came up out of
the engine room they were hot and
tired and the want of sleep was begin-
ning to tell on warren the fresh air
braced him and he sat down on a hatch
coaming in the well deck and felt in
the pocket of his dungaree for a cigar

  the m ongol-ias cargo had been
transferred to the dock and she was
coaling from a barge alongside the
bamboo men were clearing the dun-
nage from the bottom of the hatches
and a chinese sailor was rigging a fall
on the mast thirty feet above their
heads a piece of heavy machinery
was to be taken aboard and a cargo
gaff was being swung into place as the
inspectors came on deck they watched
the busy chinaman for a while then


the pocpular magazine

wemple suggested that they wash up
and go to lunch karl led the way to
the gangplank warren following
him stopped for an instant and rapped
the hollow iron mast with his knuckles
for the instinct of the chase was strong

  the pause came nearly being fatal
something flashed from the sailors
hand whizzed through the air and
passing within an inch of warrens
head struck him a glancing blow on
the shoulder and bounded to the deck
he leaped backward with a cry and
clapped his hand to his shoulder just
as wemple turned and picked up an
iron marlinespike the old inspector
looked aloft and  cursed the sailor
roundly the chinaman jabbered pro-
testingly evidently in apology for his
clumsiness and started to slide down
the mast

  wemple looked at the marlinespike
for a moment then tossed it aside and
turned to tom warren who was still
rubbing his shoulder it vos a narrow
cscape tommy he said better we
get out of here and pretend you dont
think nothing of it theres something
in the wind sure theyre trying to
lay you out tommy

  nonsense karl protested warren
the boy dropped it accidentally-

  sure-accidentally-oil purpose 
better you keep your eyes open old
icarl aint such a fool all the time

  the incident of the marlinespike was
quickly forgotten in the intricacies of
the search warren spent a busy
thcugh fruitless afternoon on the liner
arul it was an hour after quitting time
when he ordered his men to knock off
for the day

  it was late in the fall and by six
oclock the water front was dark war-
ren dog-tired decided to go home for
supper and a good nights sleep he
changed his clothes quickly and left the
dock taking a short cut along the front
the mission street cars had their
eastern terminus at the ferry building

and he would be sure of a seat while
if he waited for the other inspectors
and took the roundabout course by way
of third street he would have to
stand up all the way home

  the going was rough but it was fa-
miliar ground to tom warren and he
made good time once he thought
he heard footsteps behind him and
stopped perhaps some one else was
taking the short cut evidently his
ears had deceived him however for
although he peered into the darkness
no one came out of it and the sound
was not repeated

  he turned into embarcadero street
and as he neared the old transport
dock the lights of the ferry building
twinkled welcomingly and he saw an
electric car rounding the curve from
mission street he breathed easier
unconsciously his nerves were strung
to a high tension and the lights were
a relief a coal bunker loomed darkly
in front of him and just as he passed
it making a detour to avoid a lumber
pile that he almost stumbled over there
was a sudden rush of feet behind him
a heavy object struck him between the
shoulders and he pitched forward
against the pile of lumber half falling
half sliding to his knees in the coal
dust

  the breath was fairly knocked from
his body  he was sorely hurt but as he
crumpled up against the boards he
turned instinctively reaching for his
gun and saw four figures leaping to-
ward him out of the darkness he
fired as he drew and though the shot
went wild it had a deterrent effect upon
his assailants they stopped for an in-
stant blit in that instant reenforce-
ment arrived from an unexpected
source warrens head reeled the gun
dropped from his hand but through the
haze he heard a wild hurroo and a
scramble of feet on the loose boards
a revolver barked over his head
the free hand



  warrens next conscious move was
a sputtering effort to rid his throat of
a fiery liquid that was choking him the
while it revived him he felt the up-
lift of a muscular arm beneath his
shoulders and heard a soothing voice in
a rich brogue as his rescuer bent over
him

  sure its gawds own blessin i had
a pint av hootch in me pistol pocket
the voice of the unknown samaritan
seemed to the dazed inspector to pro-
ceed from an immeasurable distance
divil a worrd out of ye now me lad
but down this flask av fixed bayonets
like a sinsible man

  warren struggled and gurgled as a
firm hand held the neck of the flask
to his mouth presently he managed
to rid himself of the fiery gag and
with the strangers help he sat up he
leaned exhausted against the lumber
pile coughing and weeping from the
crawl of the water-front whisky a
fair portion of which had managed to
find its way down his protesting throat

  who the devil are you  he man-
aged to gasp in tones anything but
grateful

  not givin ye a short answer but
whats it to ye  retorted the stranger
brusquely he struck a match and
after groping around a moment in the
coal dust he found warrens gun and
handed it to him he snorted disgust-
edly

  an so thats the popgun ye carry
an four crooks layin for ye  the
more fool you get yerself an auld
service revolver wit a long barrel an
ye may hope to hit somethin praise
be i had wan o that same litter on
me as wan av yer friends knows to
his sorrer sure the two that stayed
carried no  away wit them while
another flew up east street like a bat
out av hell i aimed for his iegs but
what wit me nerves upset an twitchin
tis more nor likely i hit him high

enough for permanent damage glory
be but youre some cop-i dont
think

  im a custom inspector retorted
warren and i wasnt expecting to be
jumped although the attack doesnt
surprise me they would have killed
me if you hadnt interfered i owe you
my life mr-er-

  divil a mister about it but sergeant
thaddeus mcsorley av the twenty-
ninth infantry

  i see you got in from the islands
 the rosecrans this morning i take
it he smiled sheepishly im glad
you got home in time sergeant mc-
sorley im certainly obliged to you
are you on guard here at the transport
dock

  man dear said the irishman plain-
tively did ye ever find an auld soger
dhrunk on jooty divil a bit when
the throopship docked this mornih i
slipped ashore id just come off guard
an was wearin me side arms an with-
out waiting to ditch me artillery i run
across from the dock for a bit av a
dhrink i forgot to come back

  for the first time in his life tom
warren felt grateful for the fact that
the army contained at least one thirsty
soldier

  but what were you doing here be-
hind this lumber pile sergeant he
asked

  shleepin off the effects av the cam-
paign ye must know sir ive been
fightin gineral jawn barleycorn all
day long i attacked in force but the
auld codger flanked me an took a
months pay as the prize av war i be-
came demoralized an separated from
me command in the retreat-spakin
plain english i was howlin drunk an
mayhap disordherly so i found me a
quiet shpot back av this lumber pile
an was sleepin soundly whin the
sound av firing woke me up musha
now says i to meself says i theyre


the cpoqpulacr magazine

dhrivin in thg outposts an wit that
i dhrew me gun an wint into action
tis the mervcy av heaven i didnt kill
ye ive been fair sphoilin for a fight
all day an to tell ye the truth twas
the wan thing needed to sober me up
are ye feelin betther agra 

  i think my backs broken quavered
warren they hit me with something
-a lump of coal i guess the harbor
hospitals only a few blocks away up
at the foot of mission street and if
youll help me to the hospital sergeant
i shall be your debtor

  faith i will that same retorted the
bibulous one and lifted wtarren to his
feet

  thank you murmured the inspec-
tor gratefully if you should get into
trouble with your commanding officer
on account of your little spree i shall
be glad to write him a letter and en-
deavor to square you im mr war-
ren acting deputy surveyor of the port
of san francisco it isnt much of a
job but the title sounds impressive
and we have an engraved letterhead
dont throuble yerself sor me en-
listmints up the day afther to-morrer
an twill be aisier to discharrge me than
thry me be summary court

  then you do not intend to reenlist
misther warren sir im a sinsi-
tive man in me cups have a care
would ye make fun av nle

  then i- take it youve had your fill
of soldiering

  i have that tis back to civil life
an a job for thaddeus mcsorley sure
only fools an horrses wurrk but then
i was always a fool

  warren took the sergeants arm and
the pair began their unsteady progress
up the bulkhead warren had suddenly
glimpsed the tag end of an idea and
the bibulous sergeant fitted into it to a
nicety a little later when mcsorley
should be thoroughly sobered he de-
cided to have a serious talk with him

chapter xii

  at the harbor-emergency hospital
the night steward examined warrens
aching back and discovered an angry
red bruise between his shoulder blades
he bathed the sore spot with liniment
and after resting for half an hour
warren decided to go home he tele-
phoned for a taxi and when the ve-
hicle arrived he motioned thaddeus
mcsorley to accompany him

  i wish youd see me safe home
sergeant he pleaded i have reason
to fear that my life is in danger and
im not in shape to put up a fight if
there should be another gang waiting
for me on my doorstep

  the call to arms and the ensuing
skirmish at the lumber pile had quite
sobered the son of mars and he readily
consented to accompany the inspector

  arrived at his home warren made
light of his injury and told his mother
that it was due to a fall in his hurry
to catch the car-which statement had
at least a shade of truth in it he in-
troduced the now thoroughly embar-
rassed sergeant to his mother and at
a wink from warren the soldier elab-
orated mendaciously on the accident
while mrs warren was worried at
first the irrepressible irishman soon
had her smiling in spite of her fears

  at warrens insistent invitation and
in view of the fact that his pockets were
innocent of cash mcsorley was read-
ily prevailed upon to spend the night
at the warren home the years had
been long however since mcsorley
had slept in a real sure-enough bed and
at sight of the spotless room and the
snowy bed his courage oozed out at his
finger tips he swore that he was a
filthy swine and could not be induced
to occupy the bed finally however
he consented to accept a pair of blan-
kets and removing his leggings and
boots and rolling himself up on the car-
pet he declared he would sleep wit
the free hand



wan eye open his heavy snores
however soon gave the lie to his state-
ment

  warrens body was too sore to per-
mit him to indulge in the sleep he
craved save for an occasional light
doze and when morning came his back
hurt him so badly that despite a plucky
attempt to rise and dress himself he
was compelled to keep to his bed his
mother phoned the customshouse at
nine oclock to inform the deputy sur-
veyor that her son was ill but would
probably be on duty the following day

  after breakfast thaddeus mosorley
started to take his leave but warren
had matured his plan of the night be-
fore and called the soldier into his
room

  i believe you told me last night
thaddeus that your term of service
expires to-day

  it does

  i have a job for you if you care to
take it thaddeus

  well tis hard to be a civilian-

  but this is semicivilian-working
for your dear uncle samuel the job
will last five months at least and the
pay is forty cents an hour

  lead on said thaddeus mcsor-
ley tl enlist wit ye

  then i must have your word - of
honor as a man and a-a soldier that
youll stay sober can you shun the
flowing bowl for five consecutive
months 

  what kind av a job have ye in
mind  queried mcsorley cautiously
its guard duty

  have no fear i never got ram-
pagin wit liquor on guard ye have
me promise-on me worrd av honor
an ive never bruk that

  very well you wild irishman ill
have you sworn in as a temporary la-
borer on the surveyors force-

  but i thought twas guard dooty

  so it is youre to be my body-

  guard and if last nights work is a
sample of what i may expect youll
have to labor youre to be my or-
derly-a sojt of scout and your posi-
tion will be one of trust since you
served me voluntarily last night 
thought you might not be averse to
serving- for pay certain people want
to get me out of their way thaddeus
and you came to hand in the nick of
time i- shall have you detailed as my
helper and you wont have much to do
except keep your eyes and your ears
open and you can carry a gun for
emergencies ill buy you a service
revolver

  ah-hah said thaddeus and licked
his lips  inemies within the lines eh
very well sir i dont know why yere
afther trustin me but wit the help av
gawd ill serve ye honest an faithful

  thank you thaddeus now here
are a couple of dollars for you re-
port to your company settle your af-
fairs with the army and come back as
soon as you can

  scarcely had mcsorley departed
when the telephone rang and mrs
warren answrered it the call was
from mrs spencer and when informed
by warrens mother of his mishap she
called ruth to the phone ruth was
greatly worried and declared that she
would visit the warren home within
the hour

 the sight of ruth spencer was a
compensation to tom warren for his
bruises he had seen but little of his
fiancee during the past month and an
hour of her companionship brightened
him up in fact she had good news
for him for since his appointment as
active deputy surveyor ruths father
had appeared to take a more friendly
interest in him and had spoken of him
twice with a note of grudging admira-
tion in his tones perhaps he might
yet be induced to look upon their en-
gagement with a more tolerant and sen-
timental eye john spencer after hear-


the potpuljtr magazine

  ing of warrens rise had with the
characteristic shrewdness of the busi-
ness man attributed it to native al-
though heretofore latent ability

  it may be he had informed his
daughter that i have misjudged that
young man of yours ruth he has
always struck me as a slow coach of
a man but his appointment to this posi-
tion must have come as the result of
ability and integrity usually promo-
tion in the customs service is political
pull and to my personal knowledge
warren has no pull

 this was a meager victory but a
welcome one and in his heart of hearts
warren did not blame ruths father
for his attitude for after all it is only
natural for parents in modest or fairly
comfortable circumstances to wish to
see their only child married well
ruths report of her fathers awaken-
ing interest served to put warren on his
mettle and strengthened him in his high
resolve to fight the smuggling ring to a
finish he resolved that nothing should
stop him now he was bound that
ruth spencer should be his wife but
he didnt desire any fuss or argument
in the matter and if in lieu of cash
and worldly position earnest effort and
ability could smooth the path of true
love warren meant to leave no stone
unturned

  although he suffered painful twinges
at every step nevertheless warren was
back on duty at the mail dock the fol-
lowing day thaddeus mcsorley had
reported intact early that morning and
warren took the ex-soldier with him
to the customshouse and had him sworn
in as a temporary laborer detailed on
the inspectors force

  the advent of the ex-sergeant caused
no comment among the inspectors at
the mail doclc a laborer had acted as
helper and messenger for wyrick dur-
ing his incumbency as captain of the
watch and it was but natural that war-
ren having succeeded to wyricks job

  should dispense with his predecessors
man and employ a helper and messen-
ger of his own moreover preferment
is whenever practicable given to hon-
orably discharged soldiers or sailors for
such temporary jobs

chapter xiii

  on the last day of the mongolias
stay in port warren made another im-
portant seizure of contraband opium-
a seizure that gave evidence of the
lengths to which the smugglers would
go to get the drug past the keen eyes of
the custom searchers and proved to
warren that he must needs possess a
high degree of cunning to cope success-
fully with the smugglers

  although his force of searchers had
been over the ship fully a dozen times
searching in every conceivable place
where opium might be cached and al-
though heretofore it had been unusual
to search the transpacific liners on
their sailing day tom warren was not
satisfied some recently acquired in-
stinct told him that his work was still
incomplete he sensed opium on the
ship and resolved to make one more
thorough search

  accordingly he detailed his men to
different portions of the ship with or-
ders to work systematically toward a
convergent center with karl wemple
and mcsorley he went forward war-
ren had confided to the old german the
story of the attack upon him at the
coal bunkers and while wemple had
twitted him for his failure to heed his
timely warning still he was greatly
pleased at warrens selection of the
ex-soldier as his bodyguard

  they searched the porter house first
pullmg out lamps and moving a heavy
oil tank away from the steel mast
they tapped the hollow mast but their
soundings revealed nothing and war-
ren flashed his electric torch down the
ladder leading to the chain locker he
the free hand



had searched the chain locker thor-
oughly three times previous and he
paused now irresolute

  think its any use karl  he asked
the veteran inspector shrugged
karl was very stout and the opening
into the chain locker was small

  you only waste your time tommy
we been to the bottom of that hole
three times already

  had karl not agreed with him war-
ren would in all probability have
elected to dispense with a fourth scru-
tiny of the chain locker but with the
perversity of all mankind karls in-
difference merely served to decide him
upon further action

  something seems to tell me to try
it again karl you know what the
bells of bow church said to dick whit-
tington 

  tell me said the german

  dick was leaving london followed
by his cat he was a poor friendless
youth and as he was leaving he heard
the bells ringing and he turned for a
farewell look at the town then he
started on but it seemed to him the
bells kept saying turn again lord
mayor of london so dick turned
back and by george he lived to be
lord mayor of london

  into that chain locker deputy sur-
veyor av the port mocked thaddeus
mcsorley to the acting deputy the man
who had the authority for six months
without the salary into it me bowld
bucko bhoy for another look

  the irish rush in where germans
fear to tread laughed warren come
along thaddeus karl im sorry
youre so fat and the hole is so small

  and leaving karl sputtering pro-
tests warren swung a leg over
squeezed through the manhole and fol-
lowed by mcsorley started down the
grimy ladder when they reached solid
footing twenty feet below the main
deck their flashing torches but dimly

lighted the black compartment the
great anchor chain stretched taut ran
through the hawse pipe lost in the
gloom high over their heads the chain
box was filled with tons of rusty chain
on top of which were piled cargo hooks
old bird cages which once had housed
some sailors beloved parrot or cocka-
too smuggled aboard in defiance of
orders broken blocks and pieces of
discarded tackle  overhead hung by
a stout rope rove through a steel beam
two huge cargo blocks dangled

  warren and his helper ran their
torches along the chicks of the chain
box tapped the discarded blocks and
even went so far as to get down on
their knees and scrape about in the
dust on the steel plates beneath them

 nothing doing said warren
sometimes its an advantage to be
fat and he laid his hand on the lad-
der rail and started to climb out six
feet up the ladder he found his face
on a level with the two great cargo
blocks hanging from the ceiling and
instinctively he turned on the ladder
and flashed his torch on the blocks as
he did so he thought he detected a
faint glint in the slight crack between
the wooden inside of the block and the
metal casing of the wheel

  come up here mac he called and
help me lower these two cargo blocks

  the cargo blocks were cut down and
warren and mcsorley bent over them
with their searchlights then they made
the discovery

  the two blocks had four iron wheels
each but these wheels had been re-
moved and metal shells made in their
exact counterpart had been substituted
these shells were readily shaken out
and tom warren had forty-eight five-
tael tins of prepared opium as the re-
ward of his industry and persistence

  the original steel wheels were not in
evidence having doubtless been stored
in some secure hiding place never-
theless these blocks had been used con-


the cpopular magazine

tinuously in the unloading of the mon-
golias cargo and this meant a change
of wheels when the tackles were rigged
and a second substitution when the
blocks were replaced in the chain
locker the vigilance of the customs
men had put the smugglers on their
guard and they had lacked the daring
to attempt to smuggle the drug ashore
under the hawk eyes of warren and
his men as the steamer sailed within
the hour it was plain that the drug was
due for another round trip to china
had not warren discovered it in the
hope that upon the liners return a more
favorable opportunity for running the
guard might present itself

  the touch of the master hand was
again in evidence and warren knew
what to expect if that hand should be
reached forth to crush him

  he stood there watching his torch
light flicker over the neatly stacked
heap of little brass tins and pondered
over the magnitude of the task he had
set himself

chapter xiv

  it was the crafty mcsorley who
broke the silence which the surprise of
the discovery impressed upon them

  be the great gun av athlone he
murmured but tis a fine clew yeve
got misther warren find out from
the mate the men he sint here afther
these cargo blocks an ye have the men
that are doin the smugglin

  thaddeus mcsorley for an irish-
man you have a head on you like a
tack the mate might be as thick in
the mire as the coolie deck hands i
trust nobody but the skipper

  well thin sir what are ye goin to
do

  were going to stack this dope right
back where we found it thaddeus by
the way who called you thaddeus any-
how arent there enough good hon-
est saints to name a man after-

  me father--gawd rest his sowl an
may the heavens be his bed-found it
in the back av a dictionary tis a
syrian name and sorra wan av me ever
saw anything good come out av syria
but a fig

  i know it said tom warren if
theyd christened you michael youd
know without even asking what course
im going to pursue

  what is it avic

  were going to stow this opium back
in these fake blocks and hang them back
where we found them then well
leave them alone the dope will go
out to china and back again and when
the mongolia returns the opium will
be right here where we can find it and
when the ship gets in well examine the
blocks again after which well watch
for the men who are sent in to bring
them on deck when discharging com-
mences these are the men who sub-
stitute the wheels and ill be hiding in
the chain locker and catch them with
the goods

   tis well hawkshaw the detective 
ye have my consint replied the irish-
man  tis a good plan and ill watch
wit ye in the chain locker and help
ye make the pinch

  they carefully replaced the opium in
the blocks and replaced the latter as
they had found them after which they
returned to the deck for obvious rea-
sons warren said nothing to karl
wemple of his discovery and thad-
deus mcsorley was pledged to secrecy

  when the mongolia sailed at noon
that day warren was confident that the
only opium remaining aboard the ves-
sel was the forty-eight tins there on his
sufferance he was confident that not
another lot had escaped him true
johnson the boatman had gotten away
with the lot in the sack thrown over-
board as the vessel entered the golden
gate but the liner had been so thor-
oughly watched at her dock that war-
ren felt convinced that only a few scat-
the free hand



tered tins could have gone ashore de-
spite his vigilance he was so proud of
his searchers and the picked men he
had detailed that for the moment he
forgot the two mysterious cases that had
been taken off the dock by the china-
town drayman the memory of linds
report brought him vexation but he
comforted himself with the thought
that while lind had been certain of
his count still there was always room
for a mistake and there was a bare
chance that the cases had not contained
opium

  his illusion was shattered within the
week answering a telephone call at
the dock one day graves crisp voice
came to him over the wire

  this is the party that gave you your
present job warren

  i shall mention no names sir pro- 
ceed

  i wish you were as cautious as that
all the time warren whats wrong
with you youve let an ungodly con-
signment of opium slip through your
fingers from the mongolia the secret
agents nosing through chinatown re-
port that hop has dropped fifteen dol-
lars a pound and that means that the
markets glutted i am not pleased with
you warren

   dont care a particular whoop
whether you are or not retorted the
acting deputy surveyor crisply you
keep off my preserves will you and
save your advice and criticism  its
five months premature you seem to
forget that

  a profound silence greeted this out-
rageous speech as a matter of fact
his effrontery almost amazed wtarren
but at his first meeting with graves
something seemed to tell him that the
way to make that astute individual love
one was to stand firm on ones rights
and fight him all over the ring war-
ren had suddenly remembered that
graves had promised him a free hand
for six months and after five weeks of

noninterference he resented graves
criticism and a sudden impulse of an-
ger had stimulated his retort

  for perhaps a half minute he held the
receiver to his ear then over the wire
came a soft and surprised

  well ill be darned

  ensued more silence finally
were you aware warren that you
had slipped up

  i was-a few hours after the slip
and a week before you were aware of
it it wont happen again please do
not bother me any more sir i dont
care to heaf from you until i appear in
your office with a squad of smugglers
all wearing steel jewelry ill blow in
on you before sixty days and youll
think im heading a chain gang
graves chuckled go to it young-
ster  he snapped and hung up

  well ive made that chap like me
at any rate grinned warren as he left
the phone and went back to the dock
out on the edge of a stringer he sat
down and lighting his pipe he gave
himself up to reflection

  lind had been right after all the
two unmarked s o cases had con-
tained opium after all warren was
satisfied of that for the amount which
the boatman had managed to pick up
off the harbor and under warrens very
nose could not have been sufficient to
have caused this tremendous drop in
the market price of the drug in the
underworld it indicated clearly to
warren that wyrick his own inspec-
tor and gilmore the dock clerk were
members of the smuggling ring in ad-
dition to one or more of the freight
clerks on the mongolia reference to
the copy of the incoming manifest of
the mongolia on her last trip would re-
veal the identity of the man who had
received the two cases aboard at hong-
kong the petty smugglers who had
their headquarters in the chain locker
would at the very least number four


the popular magazine

should the chinatown drayman return
to the dock lind would be certain to
recognize him and his capture was cer-
tain by trailing the teamster to his
rendezvous the higher ups in the ring
would be discovered and figuring
roughly tom warren saw very clearly
that with half-decent luck he would
break the backbone of the smuggling
ring at one blow

  he had found the pawns in the game
now and nothing remained save the
capture of the men behind it was
well enough to make seizures of the
contraband drug and the newspapers
had already given him his measure of
cheap glory for that but publicity
was not sufficient and in a measure it
was injurious for knowing of his ac-
tivity the smugglers would be all the
more wary and he had already had
sufficient evidence that his own life was
a very insignificant factor in their reck-
oning

  warren waited with impatience the
arrival of the persia the vessel was
due the following monday and he
hoped-nay prayed that she would
bring another consignment to shui on
he resolved that upon her arrival he
would leave to karl wemple and his
most trustworthy searchers the intri-
cate details of the search aboard ship
for the contraband drug while he him-
self assisted by lind and mcsorley
cast quietly about for the men who were
turning the big tricks right under his
very nose

  he wondered if bill wyrick had had
any hand in the attack upon him at
the coal bunkers but though he watched
all of his force narrowly not a man
either on the inspectors force or the
force of laborers had been missing or
-injured the day following the attack
although mcsorley was positive that he
had wounded two of warrens assail-
ants perhaps they were merely water-
front thugs after all nevertheless he

decided to take no chances and kept
the ex-soldier close to him at all times

chapter xv

  the persia made port on monday as
per schedule and a busy afternoon at
the dock followed her arrival how-
ever she would not commence discharg-
ing cargo until the following morning
the passengers baggage having to come
ashore first

  warren superintended the checking
of the declarations and at four oclock
sent thaddeus mcsorley uptown to the
customshouse with a packet cf official
documents and as the old soldier took
the papers warren whispered a brief
sentence to him the temporary la-
borer answered with an almost imper-
ceptible nod and went about his busi-
ness

  when the last declaration had been
passed the day men left the dock and
warren walked to the cars with his
fellow inspectors several of them
dropped in at black petes restaurant
but warren announced his intention of
going home for dinner and a much
needed rest

  later events evidenced a purpose in
this announcement

  it was shortly after ten oclock that
night wthen tom warren felt his way
along the railing of the landing stage
at curleys boathouse  folsom
street wharf leaned over peered into
the darkness beneath him and whistled
softly the signal was immediately an-
swered in kind and warren groped
his way down the ladder an electric
torch flashed momentarily and warren
walked along the landing stage toward
the source of the flash

  is that you demanded a rich
irish brogue warren wishing to test
his lieutenants alertness remained si-
lent and after a brief interval he
heard the soft click of a revolver

faith an if its not you youll wish
it was muttered thaddeus mcsorley
the free hand



  it is i said tom warren

  is that so then if thats i this
is me

  a chuckle came out of the darkness
as the ex-soldier grasping the painter
of the skiff in which he had sat await-
ing the arrival of his chief pulled the
little craft in to the landing stage he
held the gunwale against the float with
one hand and stuck the other out to
warren

  this way agra sure ive been
worried sittin here alone waiting for
ye

  the gang thinks im safe home in
bed thaddeus quiet now

  warren took his place at the muffled
oars and pulled the skiff slowly along
in the deep shadow of the long black
dock they crept silently around the
end of the wharf save where the
twinkle of an occasional star showed on
the placid surface of the bay the night
was well suited to their purpose and
as they started down the bay skirting
the ends of the piers they could see
nothing save the myriad lights of the
city behind them

   tis a grrand night for a surprise
party quoth the irrepressible celt in
low tones while ive done me share
av dirrty outposts twas on dhry land
wit more fightin room than we have
in this cockleshell av a boat im not
at home misther warren i was never
much av a wather fowl and divil a
sthroke can i swim at all at all have
a care would you upset the boat tit
pay dav only to-morrow an ive made

 will-

have you got your gun thaddeus
i have-an well iled an greased
this salt night air plays the divil wit
a gun are we out for a reconnoissance
as we say in the service

  exactly i havent forgotten the
old tricks of the smugglers when i was
a night inspector they usually try one
or two of them the first night a liner

makes port the persia is nearly five
hundred feet long and a man in a boat
cant watch every inch of her

  gawd willin well take a prisoner
or two said mr mcsorley piously
the lust for adventure was in his wild
blood and he was used to night attacks
he lapsed into silence thereafter and
warren rowed steadily for ten min-
utes they went gently up the bay on
the vanguard of the returning flood
tide and presently they sighted the red
and green lights at the end of pier no
 and made out the huge bulk of the
persia tied up at the dock warren
thereupon headed a trifle farther out
into the fairway and they were well
beyond the south side of the pier before
he brought the skiff around and pulled
shoreward

  pier no  is the southernmost pier
on the water front and the persia was
docked on its north side cautiously
and silently warren pulled in from the
south side and felt his way in through
an eight-foot gap between the foul
barnacle-incrusted piles under the dock
he unshipped his oars noiselessly and
the momentum carried the skiff gently
to the north side of the pier where it
bumped the piling warren quickly
passed the painter around the pile the
boat swung easily away on the ebb and
the line held taut

  the great hull of the liner lying close
to the wharf had shut off the dim star-
light even the faint glow from an
arc lamp on the dock failed to show her
black bulk the two men were in
stygian darkness

  for perhaps fifteen minutes they
hung to the pile listening then as no
sounds came to them out of the night
warren cast off the painter and slowly
shunted the boat from one pile to the
other shoreward toward the head of
the dock  frequently they tied up and
listened but save for the gentle surge
of the returning tide around the piling
no sound broke the stillness the old


tub pular magazine

familiar stench of the bay mud assailed
warrens nostrils and brought vividly
back to him half-forgotten memories of
his five lean years as a night inspector
he wondered if the guarding officers
were at their posts

  however although he had expected
he might find signs of life aboard the
steamer he was disappointed there
was never the sound of a voice or the
ghost of a gleam of light gently war-
ren poled the skiff along under the dock
and they were close to the persias bow
when they finally stopped to rest

  for two hours they hung there while
slowly the tide rose warren fearing
to remain longer at his vigil in case
the returning tide should catch them
under the dock at fuli flood and en-
danger their lives was about to give
up and return to a safer position on
the south side of the dock for a -further
wait of an hour or two when a sharp
click almost over their heads caused
him to lean forward and press mcsor-
leys knee warningly an instant later
a round glowing eye popped out of
the darkness a port had been opened
in the focastle and a light had been
switched on

  presently a face appeared at the port-
hole it was so close to him that war-
ren could have-struck it with his oar
by standing up in the boat for a mo-
ment the face was framed in the lighted
port then it vanished only to reap-
pear an instant later the mans hand
came into view then pushing a small
bundle through the opening and war-
ren saw that there was a cord attached
to the bundle slowly it was lowered
until with a slight plash it touched the
surface of the water instantly a bright
beam of light flashed from under the
dock athwart the bow of warrens
boat and he and mcsorley sprang to
their feet

  a vicious curse came from back of
the light and darkness reigned once
more warren stooped for an oar but

before he could touch it something
crashed into the side of their boat ca-
reening it sharply and tom warren
and thaddeus mcsorley clutching
vainly at the air went overboard head-
first into the foul waters of the bay

chapter xvi

  warren came up sputtering like a
seal and in a stroke or two bumped
into a pile and clasped its incrusted
sides he locked his arm about it
tightly regardless of the sharp bar-
nacles which cut into his flesh and
peered upward at the hull of the persia
the light in the focastle had been ex-
tinguished however and he heard the
furious splashing of oars not twenty
yards away and watched a recurrent
flash of light playing on the waters
ahead of the departing enemy

  all of this had taken less than a min-
ute but it was fully that long before
the thought of poor mcsorley flashed
across warrens startled consciousness
for obvious reasons he had not dared
to call to the irishman but he had no
doubt the veteran was clinging to the
boat or to a neighboring pile

  warren felt in his pocket for his elec-
tric torch but it had slipped out and
gone to the bottom almost at the same
time lie heard a gurgling and splashing
back of him and suddenly he remem-
bered mcsorleys statement that he
could not swim he let go the friendly
pile and struck out in the direction of
the sounds

  the irishman had gone down for the
second time and warren was bewil-
dered there was no further sound to
guide him so he treaded water and
waited presently a writhing object
struck his knee he reached for it and
his fingers closed on a thick mop of
hair as he brought the almost uncon-
scious irishman to the surface the surg-
ing tide swept them both against a pile
and warren clung to it with one arm
the free hnd



while he held his companions head
above water with the other

  mcsorley was almost gone but he
had life enough still left in him to grasp
warren a terrible nausea had seized
mcsorley and he was spouting salt
water at a tremendous rate when he
had at least half emptied himself of his
bitter cargo warren spoke to him in
low tones

  can you manage to hang to the pile
by yourself mac

  i can-for a while whispered poor
mcsorley hoarsely

  then hang on ordered warren
and shoved him against the pile he
clung to it like a limpet and warrens
hand feeling around the dripping body
found the electric torch in the helpers
pocket well incased as it was he
hoped that the salt water had not as
yet penetrated sufficiently to injure the
dry battery and as he pressed the but-
ton a beam of light lit up their dark
surroundings twenty feet away their
boat was swinging tied to the pile and
with a great feeling of relief warren
noticed that the oars were still in the
boat he handed the torch to mc-
sorley who was clinging to the pile
with arms andlegs

  hold the torch mac he whispered
im going to swim to the boat and
come back for you

  be quick about it sir replied the
ex-soldier weakly i can shtand this
terrible bumping about five minutes an
then its kitty bar the door

  but warren was off swimming for
the boat he reached it rather abruptly
with his nose climbed in cast off and
guided by the light from the torch held
in mcsorleys free hand he ran the boat
alongside the irishman shipped his
oars reached overside and with a
quick pull hauled the half-drowned
man in over the point of the bow

  im a good soger but a poor sailor
half whimpered mcsorley whose cour-
age inured to bullets had nevertheless

been put to a severe strain by his ter-
rific experience

  warren made no reply but took his
place on the thwart and thrust out his
oars

  light us out from under this awful
dock he said it may not be too late
to catch a glimpse of that boat

  glancing back over his shoulder as
mcsorley huddled in the bow flashed
the torchlight warren pulled with all
his might toward the outer end of the
dock the sounds of retreat having in-
dicated to him the course which the
other boat had taken warren was
confident that whoever the boatmen
might be they had not recognized him
or mcsorley for their torch had flashed
for barely an instant and then fully
foui- feet in front of warrens skiff
and while the bow of their little boat
had been visible warren and mcsor-
ley standing farther back had been in-
visible the smugglers for such war-
ren felt them to be anxious to avoid
identification had been glad to retreat
in the dark and without betraying any
curiosity as to the identity of the men
in the customs boat

  of one thing warren was certain
the smugglers had not taken the ime
to rescue the bundle dangling on the
string at the porthole their haste to
escape during which they had crashed
into the customs boat was indicative of
their fright and warren had no doubt
but that the fellow in the persias
focastle alarmed at what had hap-
pened had drawn the opium back
through the porthole

  the possession by one of the smug-
glers of a powerful electric torch while
to be expected of parties cruising under
a dark dock nevertheless helped to con-
firm warren in his belief in wyricks
guilt all of the inspectors on the night
watch carried them and warren had a
feeling that even if wyrick had not
been in that mysterious boat some one
of the force had

  as warren came out from under the
wharf and headed his boat north to-
ward the ferry building the sound of
oars grating in rowlocks came faintly
to him down the slight breeze that
fanned the bay with all his strength
and skill he strained at his oars

  suddenly mcsorley shouted i see
them i see the divils arrah wait
till i get me two hands on them
warren turned a ferryboat mak-
ing in to her slip at the ferry depot
had bent her powerful searchlight and
picked up the end of the slip and in
the dazzling light warren could see a
small black skiff containing three men

o	

two of whom were rowing furiously
the skiff lay directly in the path of the
ferryboats searchlight and a cry broke
from warren

  the fools shell hit them and
drive them under

  he was right in their haste to place
as much distance as possible between
them and pursuit the men in the skiff
had taken the chance of crossing the
mouth of the ferry slip directly under
the bows of the ferryboat they had
miscalculated by a slight margin and
as the searchlight picked them up war-
ren and mcsorlejf- heard a shout from
the bridge of the ferryboat a second
or two later the great craft bore down
on the skiff drove it under and surged
on into her slip

  tull ye divil shrieked thaddeus
mcsorley were not too late to pick
up a smuggler or two bedad arrah
but tis an unprofitable business

  warren bent to his oars and the tide
well at the flood by this time retarded
him but little while it swept the frag-
ments of the skiff and her unfortunate
occupants down the bay toward them

  i hear wan av thim shouting bloody
murder piped mcsorley sure
enough faint cries for help came to
them out of the night within two min-
utes they were so close at hand that
mcsorley sweeping the surrounding

waters with his torch made out a black
object swimming and begging piteously
for help

  warren guided by mcsorley pointed
the skiff toward the cries and as they
glided past the ex-soldier reached out
and grasped the drowning man by the
collar

  i have him sir he yelled do ye
give me a hand to lift him in  im that
weak meself i cant manage him alone

  warren dropped his oars and ran
forward and an instant later the drip-
ping body was hauled into the boat
mcsorley turned the torch full in his
white face and warren started

  hello johnson he said so ive
got you at last whats become of the
others 

  johnson for it was the boatman
commenced to cry i dunno war-
ren he wrailed the ferryboat hit us
i jumped and cleared the paddles but
the others-were slow-and i didnt
hear-them-callin-	

  no more did i interrupted the
philosophical mcsorley lave us
cruise around and look for them the
ferryboats put out a small boat and
shes cruisin around too

  but their search was in vain after
a perfunctory search of fifteen minutes
the ferry crew put back warren and
mcsorley assisted by the rescued john-
son searched and shouted and hallooed
for fifteen minutes longer but could
find no trace of the two men who bad
accompanied johnson in the ill-fated
skiff johnson himself was the first to
give up

  its no use warren he sobbed
theyre gone

 who were they warren de-
manded

  johnsons crafty soul shone through
the tears in his eyes

  i dunno warren they engaged
me this afternoon to row em over to
mission rock warehouse they stayed
late there an made me wait for em
the free hand



and i was a-pullin em back to jack-
son street wharf when the ferry run
us down

  faith twas in a hurry ye were me
lad said mcsorley quizzically

  dont lie johnson we chased you
out from under pier no  ive
been keeping myye on you quite a
while and now ive got you youre

out that day the mongolia came in but
ive got you now you lie when you
say you spent the afternoon at mission
rock you ate your dinner to-night in
black petes i saw you there

  well you wont get nothin out o

  warren made no reply he pulled
in at curlys landing stage and stepped
out on the float johnson followed him
and mcsorley came next

  have a care would you thry any
funny business johnson warned the
irishman i have a gun pinted at the
geomethrical cinter av your black-
guard back

  oh put up your gun thaddeus
im not going to bother with johnson
to-night were all wet and chilled and
its no time to fool with small fry ive
got the goods on you johnson but you
can go you have a wife and some
kids havent you

  the boatman did not answer and
warren continued

  you trot along home to your kids
and your missus johnson and dont tell
anybody where youve been if you
dont ill keep mum and so will mc-
sorley youre not the man im after
i want the chap higher up and youre
too pitiful skip along now or youll
catch your death of cold and remem-
ber-stick to boating leave smuggling
to the others

  johnson stood silent for a moment
stunned in the face of such magnanim-
nity

  you mean-you mean youre not

going to can me warren he said
slowly

  mcsortey chuckled aint he the
innocent lamb

  no youre not arrested you can
go this time but remember no more
opium smuggling if you try it again
ill get you and ill get you good and
hard now good night and behave
yourself

  id like to shake hands first said
johnson and stuck out a calloused
chilly paw warren shook it heartily
and johnson departed into the night

  tra-la-loo caroled mcsorley
and ye might have the manners to say
thank you he turned to warren as
they ascended the steps to the bulk-
head

   tis not me habit to question me
superiors misther warren but to save
me sanity will ye tell me why undher
heaven ye let that lad go about his
business 

  warren laughed id rather have
his friendship than his enmity be-
sides while i can bluff johnson  could
never bluff his attorney if it came to
a show-down we didnt see him under
the persias dock although we know
for a moral certainty he was there we
cant prove anything on him and if im
any judge of human nature johnson
has had his fill of smuggling the man
was scared stiff hes afraid of me
now and i have placed him under a
debt of gratitude anyhow whats the
use sloughing a poor ignorant devil
like johnson doesnt break up the opium
traffic

  at the ferry they hailed a taxi and
went home mcsorley had nothing to
say for his teeth were chattering with
cold as he vent up the stairs into the
home of the i n he was guarding how-
ever his tongue was loosened

  wirra wirra he said but civil
life aint half bad at all at all sure
ive had adventures enough to-night to
do me a week

  black petes saloon and restaurant
was closed when warren and mcsorley
passed it by the following morning on
their way to the mail dock at one
oclock inspectors returning from lunch-
eon brought word that black petes
place was still closed and at quitting
time the word was being passed along
the water front that  black pete had
mysteriously disappeared also war-
ren was short one man in his day watch
inspector brennan had failed to report
for duty and inquiry at his home re-
vealed the fact that brennan had not
been home the night previous

  when two days had passed and
neither black pete nor inspector bren-
nan had materialized tom warren had
an inspiration

  i believe im gradually breaking up
this opium ring karl he remarked
sententiously to inspector wemple
hereafter karl make it a point to
search the lunch baskets of every long-
shoreman that leaves this dock

chapter xvii

  about the time that tom warren and
thaddeus mcsorley were having their
adventure under the dock inspector
wyrick dressed in plain clothes a
slouch hat pulled over his eyes walked
down clay street hill and stopped at
the corner of spofford alley he was
in the very heart of chinatown the
busy celestials pattering by took no
notice of him and after a cautious
survey of the neighborhood he entered
the alley and hurried along the sidewalk
for half a block pausing at last before
the basement entrance of a narrow
building

  painted in black sprawling letters
above the door was the legend fong
kee clam depot and underneath it
several chinese characters

  wyrick went down the stairs an
old chinaman shelling clams by the
light of a kerosene lamp at the farther

end of the room looked up and shuffled
a step or two forward at his entrance

  hello fong said wyrick hows
tricks 

  whats a malla wha you want
the chinaman responded surlily

  bill wyrick cast about for a chair
i want to have a little chat with you
fong you neednt gfet huffy about it
he took a manila cigar from his pocket
have a smoke

  the mongol accepted the cigar
leaned over his lamp chimney and
sucked a light from the flame

  the foul odors of the place nauseated
wyrick btit his business was- impor-
tant and he had to make the best of it

  youre a stingy old chink fong
he twitted wont even waste a match
when you get a smoke for nothing
aint you even going to ask me to sit
down 

  the chinaman mumbled an unintel-
ligible reply lifted a coal-oil can into
which he had been opening clams from
a bench and crunched the scattered
shells under his slippers as he carried
it to the other side of the room he
shuffled to the doorway peered up the
stairs for a moment then closed the
door and bolted it wyrick sniffed dis-
gustedly lighted a cigar and sat down
on the bench fong kee as if begrudg-
ing the time he had wasted resumed
his clam shelling

  whats the matter with you fong
asked wyrick youve got an awful
grouch on you to-night

  me no likee lose ah-peen-yeen cost

tors meaning he affected ignorance

wyrick forsook his pidgin english for
the moment

  fong kee grunted

a chance for profit

  two hundred dollars

  no can do you give fong littlee
piecee money fong get caught-he

  fong kee shook his head

  the chinaman was silent and wy-
rick knew that he ha- named a tempt-
ing price

  all right thats settled said the
inspector after a long pull at his cigar

cxa

the clam dealer asked at length

chinaman make very bad witness he

   fong kee nodded his head and there
 was a murderous gleam in his eyes
 back of the old chinamans stupid


the pocpular magazine

countenance there was a crafty brain
fong kees besetting sin was avarice
and he had lost a round sum of money
through warrens seizures of the
opium hence by entering into wy-
ricks scheme he could serve two mas-
ters-revenge and greed besides the
plan was absurdly simple and -fong
kee had engaged in similar enterprises
on former occasions and always with
success although the victims had al-
ways been men of his own race
johnnys word was as good as his bond
and fong did not suspect for a moment
that bill wyrick was not johnnys
mouthpiece in this affair for wyrick
had had dealings with fong frequently
in the past and fong had turned over
large sums of money to wyrick who
acted in the capacity of agent for the
man called johnny

  johnny-it was a potent name
the head of the smuggling ring carried
a deal of weight indeed if the in-
spector had approached fong kee on
his own behalf-if he had offered fong
twice the amount of money to put tom
warren out of the way to satisfy his
own personal grudge it is doubtful if
the chinaman would have entertained
his proposition for a moment but wy-
rick understood the old clam dealer
thoroughly and was wise enough to put
the burden of warrens removal up to
the head of the ring

  wyrick waited patiently although
the wizened chinaman was looking at
him intently the inspector knew that his
thoughts were elsewhere that his brain
was revolving the possibilities of the
suggested plan

  presently fong kee drew a deep puff
of smoke from his cigar stub threw the
stub on the floor and exhaled the smoke
slowly through his nostrils

  all li me fix um he said and re-
sumed the shelling of his clams from
which it would seem that the killing of
a man was a matter of everyday occur-
rence with fong kee

chapter xviii

  fortunately tom warren and thad-
deus mcsorley were none the worse for
their ducking the morning following
their mishap warren made his round
of the north-side docks and stopped at
the inspectors room in the ferry build-
ing on his way back to the persia
here in addition to the daily official
communications from the customs-
house he found a letter which was post-
marked one a m and addressed to
him in a scrawling hand its receipt
somewhat surprised him for the mes-
senger usually took his mail direct to
pier no  when the china steam-
ers were in

  warren opened the envelope and
perhaps it was fortunate that none of
the inspectors were on hand to study
his countenance as he read the missive
it contained it was a gem of illit-
eracy 

  dear sir i take my pen to warn you that
there is dope coming in i been standin in
with a chink wot promised to split  a
tin for me helpin him to get it off but he
aint seen me with no dough they aint no
chinaman can dubble cross me pong chung
number  spofford ally is the name of the
place which it will be brought to two hun-
derd tins i red in the noospapers wot you
been doin and i hope you ketch pong chung
i dont want no money for this i want to
git even thats all you go to pong chungs
place tomorrow night about  oclock with a
cupple of men and you can pinch the gang
take it from me hopin you will take this
tip	one who is sore

  warrens first feeling was one of ex-
ultation he read the letter again at
last he had something tangible-some-
things that would lead him up to the
headquarters of the smuggling ring

  he thought at first of handling the
affair single-handed but quickly aban-
doned the idea it was too foolhardy

  who would he select to help him
make the raid  his old failing inde-
cision returned to him in his crisis
and inasmuch as he had consulted karl
thb frbb hjnd

wemple in past difficulties he decided
to do so in the present dilemma

  he put the letter in his pocket and
took the short cut along the water front
to pier no  where he went at
once aboard the persia none of wem-
ples men were in sight so he walked
aft giving the little three-note whistle
that the searchers use as a signal to
call each other when working separ-
ately his call was answered when he
leaned over the after hatch and in a
moment karl wemple appeared look-
ing aloft quizzically warren beckoned
to him and karl came up on the deck

  warren took the envelope from his
pocket andhanded it to wemple the
old inspector read the letter through
slowly looked about him when he had
finished and handed it back without a
word

  well whal do you think of it
warren asked impatiently

  i dont know

  you dont know whats the mat-
ter with you karl  you ought to be
tickled to death

  i dont see nothing to laugh at
tommy

  oh you know what i mean why
its the chance weve been waiting for
-the chance to break up the smuggling

	

ring

  i aint so sure about that

  what do you mean karl 

  just because some sorehead wants
to get even on a chinaman dont think
we catch the whole band already
tommy

  well it may lead up to that re-
turned warren who was becoming ir-
ritated by karl wemples apathy
anyway i came to you for advice

  so you havent asked the old man
for advice lately you been going it on
your own hook tommy karl tried
to look hurt but his eyes were twin-
kling

  warfen however was too deep in
his new problem to argue with wemple

  who do you think id better take
with me to-night karl 

  you was really going to chinatown
yourself

  why of course-

  dont do it

  why not

  better you take that letter and show
it to graham dummkopf what you
are how do you know what you go
up against 

  what can graham do he dont
like me-hell take all the credit him-
self-

  no hell make a big raid of it
you and graham will vork together
and hell have a dozen men on the job-
then nobody gets hurt hell play it
up for the papers and the whole force
gets a boost tommy better you play
safe

  tom warren did not take kindly to
karl wemples suggestion and a heated
argument resulted but the placid old
inspector finally won his point in the
end and induced warren to go to the
customshouse

  when warren opened the door of the
deputy surveyors office he stopped
inside the threshold somewhat non-
plused as he saw sitting by the win-
dow mr graves the secret-service
chief graham was not in evidence

  well warren have you caught the
smugglers  said graves the man
from washington was imperturbable

  in spite of the touch of irony back
of graves salutation warren sensed
again that note of friendliness

  not yet but i expect to he an-
swered read this mr graves he
handed over the letter

  graves ran through it quickly it
was an old story to him

  hum-m-m anonymous he said
when he had read it through its the
old game warren your anonymous
letter writer is worse than a snake he
strikes in the dark he is too much of
a coward to show himself for fear that


the pocpular magazine

he will feel your heel so he hides be-
hind his anonymity and puts it up to
you to do his dirty work and take all
the risks what are you going to do
about this warren

  i had intended to lay the matter
before mr graham i-er-thought
two heads would be better than one i
didnt expect to see you sir

  the secret-service chief chuckled
never mind bothering mr graham
he said ill take charge of this case
myself

  but mr graves- 

  dont you think i can handle it
  yes-of course-but i was going to

  warren this may be a dodge to put
you on a false scent to get you out
of the way while the smugglers put
something over he smiled enigmati-
cally you went to the hospital once
vou know

  tom warren gazed at him

  thats so he said slowly but
my back is no longer sore and id for-
gotten

  graves creased the letter carefully
and put it in his pocket

  you stick close to the persia war-
ren he said and ill find out if this
letter is straight goods

chapter xix

  warren went back to the persia he
was disappointed for his enthusiasm
had had a setback when karl wemple
had persuaded him to share the glory
of the capture with deputy surveyor
graham and finding mr graves alone
in the office and so willing to relieve
him of his chinatown detail had put
the cap on his misfortunes

  how true the old saying the ways
of providence are inscrutable

  tom warren would have gone to cer-
tain death had he not decided to consult
karl wemple

  clearly bill wyrick had determined
to ignore the threat of the man called

johnny johnny the head of the
ring and every inch a smuggler was
nevertheless not a murderer and had
told wyrick in the little back room at
black petes that he would drop him
from the ring very quickly if he tried
in any way to bring bodily injury to
tom warren nevertheless wyrick
had not heeded him for no other hand
save the hand of bill wyrick could
have been back of the attack on warren
at the coal bunkers an attack which had
been bungled through the timely ap-
pearance of thaddeus mcsorley

  wyrick was certain of his ground
after his visit to fong kees clam depot
for he felt confident warren would rise
to his bait he had even had assur-
ance enough to write the anonymous
letter to warren carefully disguising
his handwriting and relying on its il-
literacy to dispel suspicion

  it is hardly necessary to go into de-
tails of graves investigation of the pre-
tended opium cache at pong chungs
fish market and it is reasonable to infer
that there was no highbinder war and
no one to make die for when fong
kee hidden in the doorway of the hop
sing tongs joss house saw among the
half dozen plain-clothes men who
searched the fish market and the cellar
beneath for opium no man who in the
remotest degree resembled tom war-
ren he remained discreetly in his door-
way moreover the plain-clothes men
were members of the municipal police
force with years of experience among
the denizens of chinatown for the se-
cret-service chief had several strings to
his bow and through the lessons
learned in a long career in the pursuit
of criminals generally knew which
string to pull

  when warren arrived at the persia
he ordered thaddeus mcsorley to keep
a constant watch on lind who in turn
was to give a prearranged signal should
the suspected teamster visit the mail
dock while the persia was in port
the free hand	

  mcsorley went below and took his
station in a stateroom where he could
see lind through the porthole he did
not have a view of the entire dock but
if lind should be called to another por-
tion of the wharf the ex-soldier could
easily change staterooms and the dock
clerk would never be out of his sight
for more than an instant

  it was late in the afternoon and
nothing had developed although karl
wemple had been the recipient of a
tip that there had been a large cache
of opium aboard it was not one of
those mysterious grapevines that are
in the air whenever an oriental liner
is in port but a message that came di-
rect from the customshouse during tom
warrens brief absence in the morning
and was founded on consular advices
from hongkong

  warren wemple and the searchers
had already gone over a great portion
of the steamer but had found nothing
harrison toland and caplan were
searching forward and warren and
wemple had worked their way aft
they had crawled about in the coal
bunkers looked in the fire boxes tapped
the engine plates poked their heads and
their torches into the donkey boiler
without success then karl had an
idea

  better we search the water tank
tommy he suggested

  all right assented warren i am
afraid its no use though the tanks
too open

  however they unscrewed the man-
hole in the top of the steel tank and
squeezed through the opening the
tank was about thirty feet long and six
feet high and was divided into several
compartments ordinarily it was used
for water ballast but it was empty now

  warren and the old inspector wrig-
gled through the narrow spaces between
the bulkheads and the top of the tank
flashing their torches into each com-

partment in passing they found each
one empty

  when they reached the end of the
tank karl wemple was first to climb
over the bulkhead his torch flashed
and warren hearing a cry of surprise
squeezed through in a hurry looking
in over wemples shoulder he saw a
pile of five-tael tins of opium on the
floor of the last bulkhead they were
not stacked but heaped up loosely and
warrens experienced eye told him that
there were between three and four hun-
dred tins in the heap the value of which
would aggregate close to ten thousand
dollars

chapter xx

  it was by far the largest single seiz-
ure of contraband opium that had been
made in years and warren stared
rather stupidly at the heap of small
red-labeled tins

  presently he laughed and drew his
arm affectionately around old karl
wemples shoulder

  this is your find karl he said
ill see that you get due credit for this
great grief what a clean-up therell
be wailing and gnashing of teeth in
chinatown when they boil this stuff
and pour it down a sewer

  i am glad for you tommy replied
the old inspector earnestly i-i am
old-an also ran but you are young
you need the record and my boy
youre making it

  so busy were they standing there in
the gloom of the great tank tossing
bouquets at each other that a slight
metallic sound somewhere in the dis-
tance made no particular impression
upon them karl leaned nonchalantly
against the steel bulkhead and spumed
some of the scattered tins with his toe
he had grown old and hopeless in the
service and unlike tom warren he
had long since grown used to thrills

  you stay here and guard this stuff
karl while i round up some of the boys


the vovula magazine

and have it removed to the appraisers
store said warren presently ill tell

mcsorley to-

  his words were drowned in a roar-
ing rushing sound back of him his
first thought was that a steam pipe had
burst in the ship but the volume of
sound quickly dispelled that notion for
the fires were nearly all out and the
steam pressure in the boilers conse-
quently very low it was the german
who guessed first the reason for the
noise and his apathy vanished on the
instant

  mine gott in himmel he shouted
they have turned the water into the
tank

  right you are karl theyre on
to us and want to drive us out before
we find the dope well by judas
theyre too late this time

  beat it shouted karl relapsing
into one of his infrequent american-
isms and together they scrambled over
the bulkheads it was as karl wemple
had guessed the valves were open
and the several compartments in the
huge tank were filling rapidly as they
reached the compartment under the
manhole the roaring grew louder and
they found themselves sloshing around
in water over their ankles

  by george the man that turned this
water on will suffer for it bellowed
warren he was fighting mad now
the third officer was aboard and he
would demand an investigation

  he groped about over his head for
the opening through which they had
crawled into the tank but could not
find it and a horrible fear seized upon
him he flashed his torch at the roof
of the tank and a cry of terror came
from him

 the manhole is closed he
shrieked theyre going to drown us
like rats in a hole

  desperately they each pressed a stout
palm against the cover twisting and
turning in a vain endeavor to loosen it

their efforts were in vain and the
phlegmatic old germans face was a
sickly white in the glare of warrens
torch as they ceased their struggles and
faced each other

  it was then that tom warren showed
the stuff of which he was made after
that first terrible instant of fright he
got back his nerve despite the fact that
he realized his enemies had trapped him
at last and that the tenure of his life
was but a matter of minutes now

  you hammer with your screw driver
on the tank karl he shouted and ill
see if i can plug the intake pipe and
he began to strip off his dungarees
wemple commenced to pound fran-
tically with his screw driver warren
saw his lips moving and knew that he
was praying

  the intake pipe was a large one and
the pumps were powerful ones war-
ren knelt in the rising flood and strove
with all his strength to tbrust his dun-
garees into the mouth of the pipe but
the inrush was too great in despair
he dropped the garment and thrust his
hands into the pipe but the force of the
water thrust them aside as if they had
been so much thistledown and real-
izing that he could not hope to stop the
water warren seized his own screw
driver and joined karl in hammering
on the side of the tank the water was
up to their knees now in ten minutes
it would be up to their armpits

  minute after minute they tapped
while the water rose and the chill assur-
ance of their fate gripped the two in-
spectors warren knew his men would
search for him presently and that the
tank would be opened there was a
chance that they would come before it
was too late

  the water had reached their armpits
slowly it crept upward over their shoul-
ders and standing on their toes they
still pounded only a new sound now
filled the small space still left in the
tank in which a sound might reverber-
the free hnd



ate it was the sound of insane cries
from the two imprisoned men as the
water encircled their necks

  then they gave up hope and the tap-
ping ceased

chapter xxi

  at about a quarter of five thaddeus
mcsorley standing well inside the
stateroom and back of the open port
saw a teamster drive down the mail
dock and swing his team in behind lind
who was checking a load the dock
clerk looked up for an instant as the
truck rumbled by him then he raised
both arms stretched them full length
brought his closed fist back to his shoul-
ders and yawned profoundly

  lind had not yet resumed his check-
ing before thaddeus mcsorley had fled
from the stateroom and dashed forward
in a hurry to find warren and get his
orders for lind had signaled the ar-
rival on the dock of the suspected dray-
man and there was no time to lose if
the drayman took a full load well and
good but if he had come for a few
cases only he might be loaded up and
gone before warren should have an op-
portunity to formulate a line of action
and it might take fifteen minutes to find
warren in the bowels of the great
steamer

  mcsorley leaned over the hatches and
sounded the little three-note whistle of
the searchers it was answered at last
from the chain locker in the bow of the
steamer where harrison toland and
caplan were searching harrison came
on deck

  have ye seen the chief demanded
mcsorley	

  he and wemple went aft replied
harrison and went back into the chain
locker

  mcsorley ran along the tween-
decks repeating his call continuously
but receiving no answer he dropped
down into the engine room looked into

the coal bunkers and peered out into
the shaft alley still no answer he
was on the point of leaving the stem of
the ship when he heard a faint tapping
and paused perhaps warren and
wemple were sounding some hollow
compartment however the tapping
was continuous and mcsorley decided
that it was some boilermaker at work
and passed on as he neared the water
tank however the tapping sounds grew
louder he was about to pass the tank
when he paused suddenly

  surely that tapping came from inside
the tank

  mcsorley glanced at the top of the
tank and saw that the manhole was
closed nevertheless that incessant tap-
ping continued to come from under his
very nose he stood there pondering
and presently the tapping became more
irregular mcsorley thought the blows
were weaker than they had been he
drew his six-shooter and rapped smartly
against the tank thrice instantly the
tapping from within was resumed furi-
ously for perhaps thirty seconds then
save for an occasional tap it died away
completely

  but thaddeus mcsorley had been
answered there could be no doubt
about it somebody was imprisoned in
that tank and desirous of getting out
so thaddeus mcsorley threw the lever
unscrewed the cover and lifted it off

 the pale face of tom warren
gleamed at him out of the water not six
inches below the open manhole war-
ren was holding karl wemple in his
arms for karl was three inches shorter
than warren and had not warren
lifted him above the rising flood his
mouth and nose would have been under
water fully two minutes before the
water shut oft the air from wawen

 thaddeus mcsorleys arm shot
downward and grasped the old inspec-
tor by the collar up he came limp
and dripping sprawling out on the tank
where thaddeus incontinently tossed

him an instant later warren lay be-
side him both thoroughly exhausted
they had been rescued not a minute
too soon

  mcsorley eyed them whimsically but
not without concern in his humorous
irish eyes

  well sir he said as warren first
to recover himself grinned up at thad-
deus sheepishly yell need no bath this
satherdy night im thinkin who
tried the water cure on ye tell me
his name sir an ill put so many holes
in him he wont be able to contain him-
self

  if i knew said tom warren id
do it myself theres about ten thou-
sand dollars worth of dope floating
around in there thaddeus

  well theres more on this dock this
minute for that blackguard av a team-
ster is loadin now i was hunting for
ye to tell ye about it wrhen i hearrd
ye tappin-here ye little german
bombshell lave be i tell ye hands
off youre as welcome as a wet dog-
well may the divil take ye for a sen-
timintal auld fool karl wemple

  after relieving himself of more water
than he had drunk in a month karl
wemple had come to sufficiently to real-
ize that the funeral arrangements had
been postponed indefinitely and with a
sputter of oaths the son of the father-
land had cast himself into mcsorleys
arms and implanted an affectionate kiss
upon each of the ex-sergeants sun-
tanned cheeks had a mine exploded
under mcsorley he could not have been
more surprised or horrified he shoved
wemple away roughly and blushing
like a girl he said to warren

  the dutchmans sufferins have de-
ranged him call toland sir an sind
the auld fool home in a hack

  oh thaddeus mcsorley roared
tom warren i love you like a
brother and grasping thaddeus in
his arms he tangoed around with him
for fully a minute

  dont blame karl thaddeus he
said joyously its a habit the germans
have with those they love

  lave be ye ramping lunatic
shouted mcsorley an pay attintion to
me message havent i towld ye theres
a certain man on the dock awaitin our
attintion

  then get out of here you irish ras-
cal  lay for him outside the dock gate
and pick him up when  he drives out
follow a block in his rear and find out
where he delivers his load stick by
him until the last chow case is disposed
of if it takes you a week- when you
have the right information for me re-
port back i shall be at the eagle cafe
all evening run along now mcsorley
leave the dock now without attracting
the attention of wyrick and gilmore
and if you want me call me on the
phone karl and i are going into the
engine room to dry out

  mcsorley turned without further ado
and vanished before he had reached
the dock he had managed to dig up a
couple of official-looking envelopes
from toland and harrison and carry-
ing them ostentatiously in his hand he
sauntered easily down the gangplank
in the inspectors room he discarded
his dungarees got into his street clothes
and walked briskly out the dock gate
in a saloon a block away he paused
purchased a drink and stood nibbling
cheese and crackers at the free lunch
counter until a quick glance over the
swinging doors showed him the sus-
pected teamster driving by with a dozen
cases of chow goods whereupon mc-
sorley took up the trail keeping a block
or two behind the truck but nver for
an instant letting it out of his sight

chapter xxii

  when warren left the mail dock at
the usual hour that evening he casu-
ally remarked for the benefit of several
inspectors who were washing up and
the fcree hand



joshing each other in the assembly
room that he had a hot tip on some
smuggled opium in chinatown and was
going to pull off a little round-up of his
own

  he had already given his orders to
karl wemple and the men he trusted
both wemple and warren were both
entirely recovered from the effects of
their horrible adventure of the after-
noon and had dried their clothing in
the engine room old karl was still a
little nervous but declared himself
game for whatever the night might have
in store for him

  warren had figured that if as graves
seemed to suspect the anonymous let-
ter which he had received that morning
had been a plant designed for the pur-
pose of getting him out of the way the
news that he had taken the bait would
quickly be passed to headquarters if
as he suspected there were agents of
the smuggling ring in hfs own force of
customs inspectors

  he went uptown to a quiet cafe en-
tered a box and ordered his dinner
mentioning to the waiter that he ex-
pected a call on the telephone he
made a leisurely meal and was linger-
ing over his cigar and black coffee
when thaddeus mcsorley burst in
upon him

  well mac

  why didnt you phone me

fomes and besides i knew id have
time to find ye in perrson besides
divil a bite at all have i had this day
since breakfast ye might have the
dacency to ask a man if he has a
mouth 

  warren ordered his henchman a steak
and potatoes and when the waiter had
gone to the kitchen mcsorley told his
story

  i trailed him up into chinatown
and he shtopped at shui ons store in
washington street near grant avenoo

where he unloaded all but wan case

  when mcsorley had finished eating


the popular magazine

they entered the waiting taxicab and
went to a public-telephone station
where warren entered a soundproof
booth and called three numbers after
brief conversations with each he came
out dismissed the taxi and turned to
his faithful bodyguard

  well we have a couple of hours
time to kill he explained mac lets
go to a moving-picture show until its
time to get busy

chapter xxiii

  at five minutes past ten six shadowy
figures guided by thaddeus mcsorley
stole across the lot back of the stewart
street building where the teamster had
delivered the chow case that same even-
ing when they were close to the rear
of the building two of the figures de-
tached themselves from the group and
slipped along the wall into stewart
street under orders to guard the main
entrance warren mcsorley toland
and caplan made their way with ex-
treme caution to the little back door

  warren crouched close to it his ear
at the keyhole listening from within
came the faint sound of voices

  toland and caplan carried axes and
warren was on the point of giving
them the signal to break in the door
when mcbride one of the men who
had been detailed in front of the build-
ing came running back along the wall

  weve got gilmore he whispered
ran plump into him as we were sneak-
ing along the wall i think he must
have been on guard hes scared to
death and begging for mercy he
wants to see you warren and says hell
squeal on the gang if youll only prom-
ise to do your best to let him down
easy

what have you done with him

  harrison is holding him covered
whatll we do with him

  ill see said warren and follow-
ing mcbride he went around to the

front of the building where he found
gilmore cowering under the menace of
harrisons gun fear had rendered the
man spineless and upon warrens
promise of a plea at headquarters for
immunity for him the dock clerk agreed
to follow his instructions implicitly he
took the precaution to handcuff gil-
more however before ordering him to
precede him back to the rear of the
building while harrison and mcbride
resumed their vigil at the front en-
trance

  arrived at the small door in the rear
gilmore inserted a key in the lock but
the lock was evidentlya false one for
the inspectors clustered behind gilmore
caught the sound of a distant buzzing
which ceased the moment the key was
withdrawn they waited a minute
passed then six distinct taps were
heard on the inside of the door gil-
more answered with a pause between
the second and third raps a bar grated
and the door swung inward

  tom warren presented a large black
gun in the face of the man who opened
the door and thaddeus mcsorley
pressing close beside him clasped a red
hairy paw over the mans mouth before
he could cry out silently and swiftly
the man was bound and gagged and laid
on the floor with caplan to guard him
and gilmore

  a faint light showed below a stair-
way entrance some thirty feet inside the
building and toward this the raiding
party cautiously went warren and
wemple stooping could just make out
a group of four men gathered around
a packing case upon which a small ker-
osene lamp stood a broad-shouldered
man with his back to the stairs was
leaning over the case and counting out
coin into separate piles while in the
foreground stood a chow case with the
lid ripped off showing it to be level-
full with five-tael tins of opium

  warren and thaddeus mcsorley tip-
the free han



toed down the stairs side by side until
the entire scene was exposed to view

  hands up it was the irrepressible
mcsorley who gave the order and by
way of emphasis he fired twice over
the heads of the little knot of smug-
glers they whirled and every arm
shot skyward with the exception of
those of the man who was counting out
the money he did not even turn to
face the intruders for as mcsorleys
bullet flattened on the masonry dead-
wall over him he quietly blew out the
light on the instant the inspectors
leaped down the stairs and sprawled on
the floor while a perfect fusillade of
bullets from a brace of automatics
whined over them

  dont shoot at the flashes warned
mcsorley to whom the song of the
bullet was very old

  they were in total darkness and the
acrid smell of powder filled the base-
ment presently his automatics being
empty the cool individual who had
blown out the light ceased shooting and
mcsorley who finding himself in a
gun fight had naturally and inevitably
assumed command spoke

  what a stupid fool ye are he-said
gently i could have killed ye a dozen
times ye gossoon and be the same
token ive killed betther men for less
yere thrapped like mice think bet-
ther av it now you with the automatics
but if ye must do some shootin blow
yer own brains out-

  a shot answered him one of the
smugglers had fired at the sound of the
daring hibernians voice and the bullet
scored mcsorleys shoulder he rolled
over on the floor while the bullets sang
over him then fired at the flashes from
the gun of the man who was shooting
at him there was the sound of a fall-
ing body a voice cried chokingly  my
god hes got me im a dead man
and one of the smugglers whimpered

  next roared thaddeus mcsorley
he was every inch a soldier dye

think this is a strawberry festival me
bucko ive had years av practice at
night fightin im at home here an
yere not you wit the money light
that lamp agin quick 

  a match scratched and flickered and
the big man cursed as he burned his fin-
gers on the hot lamp chimney war-
ren flashed his electric torch on the
group and every hand went up again
two of them clutching revolvers war-
ren and mcsorley kept their lights play-
ing on the group and kept them cov-
ered while werpple and toland re-
moved the guns from the smugglers and
snapped the handcuffs on their wrists

  i hit wan av them said mcsorley
complacently to kill a man in the
line of duty worried thaddeus mcsor-
ley about as much as it worries a small
boy to shoot an english sparrow

  hes back of the packing case said
toland and flashed his light on the
form huddled there

  the inspectors looked behind the
case lying on his back with his
glazed eyes staring unblinking into the
dazzling circle of light lay bill wy-
rick the customs inspector who had
found his duty less profitable than
smuggling he had been shot twice
through the breast and was quite dead
in his hand he still clutched the revolver
with which he had fired upon mc-
sorley

  ach dis iss terrible said karl
wemple

   twas the best way out for wy-
rick rejoined the philosophical mc-
sorley betther death nor dishonor
he saw the uniforms and knew the in-
spectors had got him why hes in
uniform himself-

  the irishman paused for tom war-
rens gun had fallen clattering to the
concrete floor of the basement and he
was staring open-mouthed at the
broad-shouldered man who was evi-
dently the leader of the ring

  you-john spencer he whispered


the tpcypulfltr magazine

and backed away horrified i-i-
didnt know how could i 

  it was true the leader of the opium
smugglers was john spencer father of
the girl tom warren loved and hoped
to make his wife and the capture had
been made in spencers ship-chandlery
store in the excitement of the chase
and having approached the store from
the rear warren had failed to recog-
nize the place in the dark

  mcsorley born leader that he was
and the coolest man among them calmly
picked up warrens revolver and
twirled it gently by the trigger guard
he realized on the instant that warren
stood face to face with tragedy-that
between the leaders of the smugglers
and his chief lay something greater than
the mere animal interest that must ever
obtain between hunter and hunted
spencer stood licking his dry lips and
eying tom warren curiously mc-
sorley with the quick wit of his race
hastened to cover his chiefs embarrass-
ment

  he reached for one of the prisoners
-a wizened little chinaman and
about-faced him roughly

  up the stairs wit you wemple
do you cover wan and do you toland
take charrge av the other misther
warren himself took afther the other
lad up outer this wit the gang av
them  and before wemple and toland
realized that they were being ordered
about by a man with no authority tom
warren found himself alone in the
basement with john spencer spencer
was the first to speak

  warren he said gravely i con-
gratulate you this will mean quite a
feather in your cap

  i would rather some other man had
placed it there sir murmured war-
ren you must know the anguish this
causes me-not to mention the terrible
blow it will be to ruth and her mother

  spencers glance dropped and brave

arid reckless as he was a tear started
down his cheek

  this is awful he said huskily-
awful but it might be worse thank
god you have made the arrest

  why  demanded warren stupidly
  you love my daughter dont you
  yes

  you wouldnt ruin her life by-
by-

  warren slowly shook his head i
cant dodge the issue he said miser-
ably id like to-to-

  you can do it clean warren only
let me get away to-night and ill be out
of the city and stay out for good when
we get upstairs dont put the cuffs on
me stand between me and your men
and when i make a break fire on me
you can fire high one jump out the
door and im gone in the darkness
warren for the sake of my family-
for ruths sake listen to reason if i
go to the pen theyll never hold up
their heads again but if i get away to-
night they can follow later and we can
start life all over again in canada
warren shook his head although his
heart was breaking it cant be done
it cant be done he murmured miser-
ably

  ill make it worth your while to let
me go on my word of honor once i
get away clean ill send you ten thou-
sand dollars-

  warren raised his hand beseechingly
please dont make it hard for me he
said its no use to try to bribe me
i cant be bought it breaks my heart
to do it for ruths sake but im going
to land you in the city prison to-night
spencers nerve was gone at that
dogged ultimatum he went to his
knees and commenced to beg for mercy
imploring warren by every tie to give
him a running chance in the dark

  for the sake of my wife and family
-for the sake of your own future hap-
piness warren listen to reason
youve broken up the ring youve got
the free hand



the goods isnt that glory enough 
this means a long prison term for me
and disgrace to my family--

  i cant dodge my duty spencer
weve both played the game according
to our lights and its the fortunes of
war that you lose

  but think of ruth-

  i am thinking of her and warren
choked back a sob precede me up-
stairs-please-and dont try to get
away the irishman will outrun you
if you start and hell kill you before
youve gone twenty yards

  spencer bowed his head the real-
ization had come to him that here was
a man who could not be bought he
gathered up the money piled on the
packing case and stood looking at tom
warren with a pleading half-surprised
look in his bold eyes warren pointed
to the stairway and preceded by john
spencer they rejoined the posse wait-
ing with the other prisoners on the
main floor he turned spencer over to
thaddeus mcsorley who promptly
linked him to gilmore while warren
went into spencers office called up the
morgue and instructed them to send
the wagon for wyricks body next he
called up the harbor-police station and
asked to have the black maria sent to
spencers ship-chandlery store and
while he waited for both wagons to ar-
rive he remained alone in the darkened
office where none might see his great
distress and silently fought between his
love and duty

  when the morgue attaches and the
police-patrol wagon arrived the pris-
oners were bundled into the wagon
toland and caplan were left in the
store to guard the opium until morning
and warren sent karl wemple home to
bed for the excitement of that never-
to-be-forgotten day had been too much
for the old fellows stolid nerves and
he was on the verge of collapse har-
rison and mcsorley accompanied war-
ren in the patrol wagon with the pris-

oners up to the harbor station where
the smugglers were locked up for the
night pending their removal to the ala-
meda county jail by the federal au-
thorities in the morning and when he
had the smuggling ring under lock and
key tom warren rang up graham
deputy surveyor of the port the latter
had evidently been awakened from a
sound sleep

  well well he growled who
is it

  warren speaking ive captured the
entire smuggling ring

  what

  all of them sir rounded up the
entire outfit in john spencers ship-
chandlery store spencer is the ring-
leader and i regret to report that
inspector wyrick whom i had under
surveillance for some time was found
with the smugglers he resisted arrest
and one of my men found it necessary
to kill him

 wha-who-why what the devil
warren wyrick killed and spencer
-what spencer

  john spencer the ship chandler in
stewart street ive just made the
raid i tell you

  why didnt you inform me of your
contemplated raid bellowed graham
youre running things with too free a
hand altogether why didnt you con-
sult with me

  well if you must know sir said
warren humbly i didnt have to and
it is merely an excess of courtesy which
prompts me to call you up now

  but spencer-surely youve made a
mistake warren spencers standing is
beyond question if youve blundered
warren youll pay dearly for it youll
feel the weight of spencers influence
where are you now

  at the harbor-police station with my
prisoners

  hold them there ill be right
down stay there until i arrive
foxy old graham mused warren


the popular magazine

as he hung up hes going to try to
save his face to-night hell beat the
reporters to the station and hog the
credit for this raid himself and he
cant get over his habit of giving me
orders wish i knew where graves
could be found id ring him up too

  graham arrived in a taxi within
twenty minutes he glowered at war-
ren lolling with his back against the
front of the sergeants desk

   well sir he said brusquely ex-
plain your failure to keep me in touch
with your plans-

   explain nothing you crook roared
tom warren sergeant i arrest this
man in the name of the government of
the united states and charge him with
the crime of smuggling as an accessory
before the fact graham youre under
arrest sergeant will you please be
kind enough to lock this man up ill
prefer a charge against him in the
morning

chapter xxiv

  for several seconds deputy graham
stood mouth agape staring at warren
the acting deputy who had dared to im-
pugn his integrity and order him under
arrest presently graham attempted a
laugh-a dry uneasy laugh

  warren he said upon my word
youre immense a boob like you going
to such lengths to get my job ser-
geant pay no attention to this man i
am j b graham deputy surveyor of
the port of san francisco and this fel-
low is merely a customs inspector and
under my supervision

  show your authority to counter-
mand my authority smiled warren

 show the sergeant your badge of 
office

  i-i left it home quavered
graham

  i figured you would he flashed
his own inspectors shield i guess-
that goes doesnt it sergeant

  the police sergeant opined that it

did	and called an officer lock this
man up he said tersely never mind
now mr graham mr warren may
be wrong but i cannot decide that ques-
tion he has the authority to arrest
you on information and belief and i
cannot argue with you

  grahams face turned what huckle-
berry finn calls a fish-belly white

  before you consummate this out-
rage warren suppose you permit me
to call up mr graves

  certainly i have no desire to
abuse you mr graves gave me a con-
tract to clean up this smuggling ring
and im only performing a very un-
pleasant duty sergeant will you kindly
permit mr graham to use the phone

  graham called up graves at his hotel
and asked him to come at once to the
harbor-police station and within half
an hour the secret-service chief arrived
quivering with rage and apprehension
graham explained the charge which
warren had made against him

  this is very serious warren said
graves it brings discredit on the
service and unless you can substantiate
your charge beyond the shadow of a
doubt ali of your good work in round-
ing up this smuggling ring will not avail
to hold you in your job i assure you of
that

  i have the affidavits of two wit-
nesses spencer the head of the ring
and gilmore the dock clerk each has
confessed for some time mr graves
i have suspected that mr graham
might have been a silent partner in this
business-in fact ever since i first be-
came convinced that wyrick one of
our own inspectors was actively asso-
ciated with the ring to-night when i
made the astounding discovery that
john spencer was the head of the ring
i recalled the fact that he and graham
have been friendly for years i had
often seen them lunching together in a
lower market street cafe besides
the free hand



wyrick the late captain of the watch
was grahams appointee it was just
a hunch i had mr graves but it oc-
curred to me to work it up so to-night
i went into grahams office and rooted
through his files in his desk i found
some canceled checks and in his letter
files i found a letter explaining to
spencer that he was powerless to re-
move me from my position as captain
of the watch i sprung this evidence
on - spencer and frightened him into
signing a written confession gilmore
was the go-between and frequently car-
ried the cash to graham i have their
written confessions signed before a
notary public i spent two hours with
them before calling up mr graham
i was too tired to go out after him my-
self so he saved me the trouble by com-
ing to the station himself inspector
brennan you will recall has not been
seen for several days he was drowned
while being pursued by me i caught
him under pier no  attempting
to smuggle opium off the persia
brennan by the way is grahams
brother-in-law i have the goods on
this man mr graves and i demand his
arrest and warren handed a sheaf of
papers toward graves graham made
a wild grab for them but graves beat
him to it

  lock him up sergeant said
graves and showed the police officer
his secret-service badge wildly weep-
ing and protesting graham was led
away to a cell while graves coolly
skimmed through the documents which
warren had handed him and which
conclusively proved that graham had
been cognizant of the operations of the
ring and had shared in the profits of
their illegal industry

  well warren said the secret-
service chief presently i congratulate
you my boy youve landed the entire
gang high and drv at one cast

  mot quite sir replied warren
smiling wanly i didnt get black

pete he with inspector brennan was
drowned when the ferryboat encinal
hit that skiff in front of her slip the
other night i captured a boatman
named johnson who is a smuggler but
i let him go hes a poor ignorant
devil and has a family depending upon
him however when the mongolia
gets back to port again ill land a few
more of the small fry although i be-
lieve them to be independent operators
at any rate the backbone of the ring is
broken as i promised you it would be
thats about all that counts war
ren the searchers can keep the rest
of the traffic within normal bounds
hereafter and now if you are through
here for the night i suggest you go
home i have a taxi waiting outside
come with me and he drew warrens
arm in his and led him outside

  tell me where you live warren
and ill take you home said graves
when they found themselves seated in
the taxi

  im not going home replied the
acting deputy sadly i have to go out
to john spencers home

  why havent you secured enough

evidence-

  warren laid his hand on graves
knee after to-night mr graves im
off this case i dont care to have any-
thing more to do with it and i want to
be relieved im going out now to break
the news of spencers arrest to his wife
and daughter its going to be a hard
job-much harder than breaking up a
smuggling ring

  then why bother about it my boy
let them read it in the newspapers to-
morrow morning why distress your-
self 

  ive got to spencers daughter
ruth is my affianced wife

  what it had been a long time
since graves had been so surprised

  yes continued warren dully
weve been engaged for more than a


the popular magazine

year and we were to have been married
when i got ahead a little farther

 im sorry said graves im
dreadfully sorry and i do hope it
wont make any material difference in
your plans-this affair of to-night

  it will you cant put a girls father
in a federal prison and still hope to
marry her its against human nature
i fear it is warren did you real-
ize this when you arrested spencer 
did i realize it warren tried to
laugh but made a dismal failure of it
spencer offered me ten thousand dol-
lars to give him a ten-foot running start
in the dark he even appealed to me
on the score of his family and begged

me for ruths sake-

  you ass why didnt you let him
go  graves demanded hotly

   i was under suspicion myself-un-
just suspicion and i had to make good
besides i was never a crook i can
stand to lose the girl but i could never
be quite happy if i lost my honor its
about all i have in this world and
besides l hoped ruth would in time
realize the fix i was in and see things
in a different light

  he spoke slowly monotonously as if
a supreme burden of woe had been
placed upon him and the limit of human
suffering reached at one stroke of fate
graves was silent for several minutes
as they rumbled through the deserted
streets of the sleeping city

  i never figured you a crook war-
ren he said presently i knew you
for an honest man that first morning
we met in grahams office neverthe-
less i didnt figure graham as a dis-
honest man-merely a stupid blunder-
ing fool foisted on the service in pay-
ment of a political debt

  they had arrived in front of the
spencer home and warren alighted
he stood by the side of the taxi and
held graves hand a moment the little
man stroked his whiskers cattishly with

the other hand and regarded warren
with a half-amused smile

  dont give up the ship warren
was his parting admonition if the
girl is worthy of you she wont throw
you over and if she throws you over
consider yourself lucky remember
this is a case of a crooks daughter
tossing over an honest man stand your
ground and wait patiently it will all
come out right in the finish

  he wrung warrens hand and tjie
taxi rolled away warren climbed the
steps and rang the front-door bell and
after about a minut ruth answered
the bell she was dressed in a filmy
lacy garment which she had slipped on
over her night robe and her brown
luxuriant hair hung down her back in
two long girlish braids

  oh is it you tom dear she said
startled i thought it was father ive
been awake in bed reading and waiting
for him to come home--why whats the
matter tom

  he had stepped silently inside and
closed the door behind him and was
staring at her with troubled eyes she
came to him and placed her hands on
his shoulder

 has something happened she
whispered tell me

  tom warren gently removed her lit-
tle white hands the dumb agony in
his eyes affrighted her

  sweetheart he said slowly and
evenly your father isnt coming home
to-night i arrested him at ten oclock
as an opium smuggler and he is now
in the harbor-police station he will
go from there to the federal prison at
leavenworth or mcneils island i
made a raid to-night and your father
was caught with the rest of the gang
he was caught red-handed-and i
couldnt let him go i couldnt warn
him-i didnt know-i-i never sus-
pected-

  she drew away from him as if his
very touch contaminated her
the fcree han

  and you arrested my father tom
you took him to prison-knowing what
this disgrace means to-to-mo-ther-

and me-

  she leaned against the wall and hid
her quivering face in her bare white
arms

  yes i realized all that ruth the
man went on inexorably i could have
connived at his escape-only he offered
me money to let him go and-and-
my honor  and his life were both at
stake if i had let him go i would
have been a traitor to the service-and
besides mcsorley would have chased

him and probably killed him-i-

  he was silent a moment biting his
lip and gazing at her piteously

  is it going to be the same between
us after this ruthie he said pres-
ently answer ruthie can you view

this thing as a man would view it-

  she turned on him passionately
no i cannot she cried for if you
had loved me you would have thought
first of me and placed my happiness
above your honor go i never want
to see your face again

  he bowed with old-fashioned cour-
tesy good night sweetheart he
said gently i do not blame you only
ive made the mistake of loving you
too well and of playing the game as
men play it good night im so sorry
for you dear-but i couldnt help it
you could she sobbed youre
climbing to promotion fver the broken
hearts of my father and mother and
me and i hate you

  he opened the door passed out and
closed it softly behind him outside a
million stars sprinkled the sky with
their radiance but the light had gone
out of the world for tom warren he
walked home stumbling along blinded
by the tears which even a strong man
may shed at times and without shame
he had done his duty and sacrificed his
love and the fruits of victory had
turned to ashes in his hands

ca



chapter xxv

  three months after tom warren had
made his spectacular raid which re-
sulted in the capture of the opium
smugglers whose organization had for
years defied the law matters in the cus-
toms service had settled down into their
old routine

  with the arrival of the mongolia
warren had kept a close watch on the
chain locker and had the added glory

  graham out on heavy bail was sus-

temporarily installed in his stead at
the trial of graham he had been con-
victed on the testimony of gilmore and
spencer but the trial judge had sus-
tained an appeal gilmore pleaded
guilty and was given a suspended sen-

other members of the ring with the ex-
ception of john spencer had been tried
and convicted and sentenced to two
years at leavenworth john spencer
never came to trial while he was
being taken from the alameda county
jail to san francisco for trial by no
less a person than the imperturbable
graves the latter had been set upon
en route by a gang of toughs knocked
down and his prisoner taken away


the cpopulacr magazine

from him despite the fact that graves
managed to stagger to his feet and
empty his revolver at his assailants his
aim was wild-due probably to the blow
which had felled him-and spencer ac-
companied by his rescuers escaped in
an automobile and although every ef-
fort of the secret-service bureau was
made to apprehend him he managed to
make his escape into canada

  it was graves who brought the news
to tom warren one day at the mail
dock

  well warren he said in his crisp
fashion i guess that man spencer
made a clean get-away

  im glad of it replied warren
dully and im infinitely obliged to you
for letting him get away

  well i tried hard enough to stop
him but theyd given me quite a rap on
the head-

  i notice they didnt hurt you very
badly and you didnt have spencer
handcuffed to you as a bright secret-
service man should have taken the pre-
caution to do and you started to bring
him over alone rats it was a put-up
job boss you framed it and its just
as well you did spencer is out of the
country by this time i dare say and he
can never come back weve accom-
plished as much good as if we had him
safe in leavenworth the rings busted
to pieces

  graves smiled despite an apparent
effort to affect amazement

  well you know warren we might
have let him go under a suspended sen-
tence if he hadnt lost his head and
started the shooting that night be-
sides he was the ringleader and we
would have had to make an example of
him-and there was the girl to con-
sider i saw her in court when her
father was testifying and i-ahem
a-humph  i was a young fellow myself
once of course im not admitting
anything young man but nevertheless
if i hear a whisper from you again of

this frame-up talk it will go hard with
you

 im as- mum as cheops mr
graves

 how about that girl warren
dont you think youd better make an
attempt to fix things up with her
warren shook his head its all up
to ruth he answered i played the
game fair and i ask no favors i can
take my beating like a man i guess
well heres something else for you
to take retorted graves and pulled a
long envelope from his pocket this
arrived from washington for you this
morning and i thought it might be
important so i brought it down

  thank you  warren tore open the
envelope and read it listlessly it was
a letter from the secretary of the treas-
ury informing him that the president
of the united states directed him to
inform warren that he had that day
been pleased to send to the senate for
confirmation the name of thomaswar-
ren for the post of deputy surveyor of
the port of san francisco as a recog-
nition of honest faithful and extremely
capable service

  whats that yere readin sir said
a voice behind him and thaddeus mc-
sorley interjected himself into the
conversation

  warren silently handed the irishman
the letter and the latter read it with
great delight when he had finished he
grasped tom warren by the shoulder
and faced him up the dock

  turrn thomas warren he said
with mock solemnity turrn deputy
surveyor av the port and go up to
yer office an yer fine fat salary for
well yeve earrned it

  he shook tom warrens hand and
eyed him a bit wistfully

  yeve been a good boss sir he con-
tinued but me job here is ended an
tis the glad man i am that were lav-
in the docks together

  but you dont have to quit thad-
the free hand



deus protested warren ill appoint
you to a far better job the moment i

take office-

  thaddeus mcsorley waved a red
hairy imperious paw yell do noth-
in av the kind-not givin ye a short
answer sir im tired av doin nothin

an im goin back to the wars-

  and he whistled a bar from the
minstrel boy

  you hear the east a-callin eh mc-
sorley suggested graves

  divil a bit tis the south thats
callin me an tis to mexico im bound
ive been offered a fine job pickin off
federal officers at two hundhred gold
per pick

  and he was as good as his word for
the following morning he came in to
warrens office in the customshouse to
say good-by the war gods were call-
ing to his wild nature and he could not
deny them

  if ye dont mind sir he said shyly
id like to keep this auld thirty-eight
you bought me tis a good gun an
god knows when ill get a betther id
like it for a soovner av ye

  so they parted

  for a week warren was too busy
with the reorganization of his new office
to let his mind dwell at any length upon
the events of the past six months the
old sting of his lost love still hurt but
time the great healer was doing its
work well

  one day he received a telegram it
was dated from a town in alberta can-
ada and as warren read it the old ex-
ultant light leaped into his rather sol-
emn eyes and for the first time since
the night of the raid he smiled the
telegram was as follows

   starting life all over again wheat farming
in alberta just heard of your promotion
i congratulate you you earned it fairly
but i had something to do with your suc-

cess and you owe me a little debt for that
ruth and mother leave to join me to-mor-
row why not come off your high horse and
ring ruth up im not much of a father-
in-law but i would like you for a son-in-
law regards to graves hes a bird

j s

  well the rascally old smuggler
laughed tom warren if he isnt try-
ing to fix it up for me hes as crooked
as a bed spring when you view him
from one angle and pretty much of a
man looking at him other ways i do
believe i could stand the disgrace of
having him for a father-in-lawr

  he had reasoned it out instantly
ruth was willing to come to him but
ashamed to make the first advance and
spencer scenting the trouble had ap-
pealed to his sense of chivalry to spare
his daughter the humiliation of coming

to him to-to-

  he took down the phone and called
a number then hello is that
you ruthie    oh hello mrs
spencer this is tom warren will
you ask ruthie if she will please come
to the phone and talk to me a moment 

      not in oh-thats too bad
w-ell good-by and he hung up just
as the door opened and admitted ruth
spencer

  tom warren sat staring pop-eyed at
her over the top of his desk

  why hello sweetheart he said
finally howve you been

  just perfectly splendid tommy
and you 

  never felt better in my life

 forgive me tom-

  did that long ago lock the door
behind you darling ill lock this one

over here-

  are we all alone tom

  all alone he satisfied himself that
no one might intrude then held out
his arms and she came to him sobbing
out her joy

the end
the bitter scar

by william m rouse

the aftermath of a fight with spiked boots in the
champlain country a story of french-canadians

it was a day in october when pierre
laflamme went up the lake seek-
ing revenge the wind coming
down from canada with a good
smell of winter slapped lake cham-
plain to whitecaps and sang in the
cordage of the sloop celeste blit for
the white scars cutting across his cheek
from nose to ear pierre laflamme
would have been happy it was busi-
ness concerning them that took him
north this day

  report had it that papinaw dupres
had come again to belle isle in the
same hour that pierre laflamme heard
this news he stood out from valeboro
bay sailing into the wind that he might
kill dupres with his hands for it
was the spiked boot of papinaw at the
end of a long fight that had plowed
across the face of laflamme time
would not take away those marks nor
anything but death the bitterness of
them

  that fight had been much talked of
along the lake papinaw had come
down from the dominion to tunk sos-
villes place on belle isle bringing a
pocketful of money and much whisky
blanc laflamme stopped there with
a parted halyard to make repairs it
is easy for a man to quarrel when he
has the will dupres was ugly and
there were words that night in sos-
villes kitchen the next day he came
upon pierre laflamme from behind
with a stick of four-foot wood but it
was not until after a battle of half an

hour that he left him helpless on the
beach

  now pierre his corded arm upon the
tiller was driving the celeste to do
all that was in her for he must not
miss this long-awaited chance thought
of the law he had put from him it was
not likely that a missing canuck would
rouse much inquiry but if there were
questions and the sheriff came la-
flamme was ready in the months that
the scar had lain across his face telling
its story to all men he had come to hold
revenge worth the price of life

  so when belle isle drew near a pile
of rocks topped with green against the
sky pierres thoughts were only as to
the manner of dealing with his enemy
sosvilles place was not alone upon the
little island there were two or three
houses of peaceful folk scattered about
and one of these stood at the edge of
the rocky cliff girding belle isles
southern shore it would be well to
land here and come upon dupres sud-
denly giving him no chance to take a
weapon

  the sloop drew in under the shelter
of the island and pierre looked up the
face of the cliff to the little house there
it was white and flowers grew about
the door a path ran up obliquely from
the bowlder-dotted strip of beach this
place was excellent for a quiet land-
ing thought laflamme as he hove over
the anchor and dropped jib and main-
sail his dinghy grated on the sand
and he climbed upward
thb cbittecr sclr



  on the edge of the cliff he stopped
with a quick breath and held himself
poised between two steps for before
him was a woman such as he had
dreamed of but never hoped to see
she stood tall and strong with all the
curves of a frailer form dark hair
curled against a fair brown face and
in her eyes was the look of one who has
become well of a great sickness she
was a woman to make glad the heart
of any man

  excuse  pierre laflammes eng-
lish was not always of the best when
he felt emotion me i come up from
the lake

  of course she smiled you
couldnt come from anywhere else up
that path

  pierres heart beat fast this won-
derful woman was talking to him as to
a frierd and almost for the moment
he forgot papinaw dupres then the
strength of his purpose returned

  i go on tunk sosvilles place he
volunteered seeking to explain his com-
ing and yet keep his errand hid for
-for business

  yes her tone was a further
question tunks place is on a good
cove you could anchor there but
maybe you never come to belle isle
before

  me i am pierre-pierre mignon
he lied from port james down south
i thought it would make good place for
anchor here to leeward

  the woman seemed to hesitate and
argue some question within then her
eyes looked deep into him but with
friendliness her voice was persuasive
its getting dusk now suppers on
the stove come in and eat before you
go to sosvilles place

  merci beaucoup laflamme hardly
could believe it true that he was to sit
at table and spend perhaps an hour
longer with her such hospitable
friendliness was not in itself unusual
but coming from this woman it was

a blessing and a delight to pierre la-
flamme i like to eat with you-better
than go anywhere

  she smiled and led him into a kitchen
the neatness of which was pleasant to
his eyes he brought in wood for the
fire and then sat watching her go
lightly from stove to table it was great
pleasure to do that he found and
caught himself wondering how it would
be always to see a woman such as she
go about ones own kitchen

  when they sat down in the lamp-
light to biscuits and honey and tea and
a steaming dish of fried potac the
woman bowed her head and pattered a
brief grace that came musically to the
ears of laflamme for it was in the
french of canada

  you are a frenchwoman he ex-
claimed dropping into the language
and yet you speak english better than
many of the yankees

  oai msieu i came from st anne
de beaupre a long time ago this i a
good place there are not many people
-and i like the lake

  ah the lake here was something
that only those of the good heart un-
derstood the lake is my home i
love her from my soul she is strong
and sweet-blue and cool to the touch
sometimes she snarls and bites and
goes steel color like the eyes of an
angry man then i love her also and
next to the lake i love my sloop ce-
leste 

  celeste cried the woman and
added in english why thats my
name

  now i know why she is so good
boat mamselle pierre was finding
himself even in the more difficult
tongue he saw celeste grow faintly
pink she rose from the table

  eat more pierre-pierre mignon
she said i must go to shut up my
chickens for the night

  she went out of the door strong and
tall and lithe and the heart of pierre


the popular magazine

swelled within him then as suddenly
his lifting spirits fell he had forgot-
ten the scar-those twisted ridges of
white that ran from nose to ear band-
ing his cheek with hideousness but
for the scar he would have dared to
love this celeste of heaven truly the
boots of papinaw dupres had killed
what chance he might have had hate
tenfold more bitter ate through him

  laflamme rose up renouncing the
woman he would go out and finish
the business on which he had come and
then sail from belle isle if le bon dieu
so willed never to land there again
for no torn wreck of a man would be
the one to win this woman and to see
her again would but make it harder
better go before she came into the
house

 darkness had come when pierre
stepped out of doors and made toward
the patch of woods beyond which lay
the place of tunk sosville it was a
gray darkness for the full moon strug-
gled behind a cloud curtain and one
could see well enough even among the
trees so he went on confidently find-
ing a path that led with many turnings
toward sosvilles

  of a sudden he heard the crunch of
leaves and little twigs ahead whoever
came it was as well that pierre la-
flamme should not be met this night
and so he stepped among the trunks
beside the path hiding behind one of
them a dim figure loomed around a
turn then hate and straining eyes told
pierre that here was his enemy come
to meet him by some good chance

  laflamme was back in the path hold-
ing himself loose-muscled and ready
the other man stopped ten feet away
it was pierre who spoke

 ho papinaw dupres he said
evenly stand up and fight me
pierre laflamme have come back to
kill you 

  a grunt silence and then du-
pres answered sneering

  you like some more of those boot
heel pierre laflamme what you do
on this end of belle isle

  sacre pierres rage could not
wait fight

  he leaped dupres gave ground but
it was only that the battle might be in
an open space where the footing was
good and the light better he met
laflamme well braced and at no dis-
advantage

  the muscles of dupres were smooth
and of the kind that seem fat to the
glance but hold great power he was
like a bear clumsy and quick and ter-
rible laflamme was long hard deep-
chested and thick of arm he was a
good sight to see when he moved it
was steel and stone meeting if the
steel did not break it would pierce the
stone

  they fought with every trick of the
north woods where always a man
fights to win and by any means locked
together they sought neck-breaking
holds a chance to gouge or bite but
there was this difference each time
that an arm swung free laflamme
drove in a blow with all the force of
his springing muscles dupres did not
strike at all

  the ground was torn the men were
less swift and for brief moments they
rested holding to each other the
breath of dupres puffed and he worked
desperately to force pierre down by his
greater weight there came an instant
when they broke away then as du-
pres sprang to the attack again la-
flamme struck low a smashing drive
that had the weight of both bodies in
it he felt his fist sink deep just under
the breastbone

  papinaw dupres breath went sigh-
ing out and he flapped to earth as
though emptied of the spirit his arms
twitched he lay still on his back
there was no more strength in him

 the moon came out pierre la-
flamme saw his own hands outstretched
the bittecr scjtr



before him nd knew that he was mov-
ing forward to choke the life from
papinaw dupres he was glad

  that was a good fight msieu
pierre laflamme

  pierre turned as one brought out of
a traice and saw the woman celeste
looking at him the heat of the fight
cooled a little but not his anger nor
his purpose toward papinaw dupres

 go back  he commanded although
with no feeling save reverence and care
for her this is not good place for
womans

  i know what is in your heart pierre
laflamme she spoke softly but with-
out fear you want to kill him there
as he lies

  suddenly pierre realized that she had
called him by his true name she must
know then that he had come seeking
revenge upon papinaw dupres he
turned and faced her in the moonlight

  oui i kill him for the shame he
put on my face i wait three five
month till he come again to belle isle
night and day i hope for those time to
come i kill him pretty quick and he

die	poof but me pierre laflamme
i have for always this mark men
they point and womans not look at me
but once that is bitter mamselle
she stepped so near that he could
hear her breathe and there rose in him
a great pain that he could not reach
out his arms and take her into them as
he might have done but for the boot
heel of the man he was going to kill

  pierre laflamme in her mouth
his name was a caress but it was also
a command to give heed see what
i do now

  she raised an arm and grasped the
flimsy white waist that she wore there
was a sound of tearing cloth and pierre
saw her shoulder rounded and bare
gleaming white under the moon but
from neck to shoulder tip and halfway
down the arm the flesh was knotted
in cruel snarls and welts now healed

a long time but never to be made
smooth again

   voila she cried i also have my
bitter scar

  when pierre could take his eyes
from that shoulder he looked into her
face this scar hurt him a thousand-
fold more than the wound upon his
cheek and yet he loved her greatly
because of it

  you are beautiful he cried in his
own tongue no one sees

  the good god sees she answered
it is to be beautiful in his sight
pierre laflamme you go to put a scar
upon your own soul that will not wear
away forever

  now laflamme was really shaken
because it was she pleading and he
argued

  you do not know revenge mam-
selle your heart is good and no man
has done you wrong that cannot be
forgiven

  she drew a great breath and laid
her hand upon his arm hesitating be-
fore she spoke

  papinaw dupres kicked me with his
spiked boots to make himself amused
i am celeste dupres his wife

  the words were in the ears of pierre
many seconds before their meaning
he shook himself and stared at her
stupidly then he seemed like to burst
with the rage that was in hirri

  he dies

  no she was bending back his
arm with strong hands listen to me
pierre laflamme how shall you
judge when god does not do you
think there is no strength in my arms
or courage in my heart that i could
not have sent a knife between his ribs
i have stood over him with the point
almost in his flesh while he slept was
it not hard to hold back my hand 
there is no love nor anything in life
for me but waiting i came here to
hide and he found me now twice a
year he comes and when i will not


the popular magazine

let him in stands and curses with vile-
ness i have known hate

  before the splendor of this woman
pierre laflamme was awed his wrath
ebbed slowly and the hulk on the
ground became a thing for pity a man
gone mad with sickness of the soul
pierre no longer had desire to feel his
fingers working into the corded throat
of papinaw dupres he would go back
to valeboro scatheless of murder and
there worship the memory of celeste
dupres until his bitter scar were eased
by death

 you-celeste-i- he strug-
gled in vain with words to speak these
things suddenly her fingers tightened
on his arm papinaw dupres was sit-
ting up a grin twisting his blood-
smeared face

  by gar celeste you like those mans
from valeboro mebbe with an ugly
sneer you pay for this some time
hey

  you papinaw dupres go back to
canada laflamme was steady it
was as though he spoke to a vicious
dog also you stay there

  dupres got -slowly to his feet reeled
and groaned at his weakness then he
hurled a stream of curses at the man
and woman watching they heard in
silence until they saw him turn shaking
his fist toward tunk sosvilles place
pierre knew that now his time of
greater trial was at hand he looked
at celeste standing straight and un-
afraid and doubly denied to him

  i must go he said thinking aloud

  yes but it seemed that there was
sadness in her voice as she agreed
first come and make yourself clean
-there is blood on your hands and
face

  together they walked along the path
and came to the little white house lying
like a haven of peace and rest celeste
had given it of her spirit thought
pierre laflamme desiring her with all
his strength he followed into the

shining kitchen and waited while she
filled the tin basin at the sink with
warm water pierre washed and then
looked into the mirror in order to comb
his hair he shuddered the scar lay
white against his red-brown skin

  on the threshold he paused it might
be that this was his last look at celeste
dupres and it racked him that he must
leave her with papinaw still on the
island

  celeste what would you do if he
should come here to-night 

  she smiled bitterly

  he has come before now as i told
you the doors are locked always
he dare not kill me-and if he dare i
am ready

  she pointed to the wall and in the
shadows pierre saw the black length of
a rifle he felt better knowing the
quality of her courage

  adieu he drank in the goodness
of her standing before him in the lamp-
light with the tattered waist drawn
about her shoulders the bare scarred
arm round and white held his eyes
adieu pierre laflamme

  he went out and set his face reso-
lutely toward the cliff in a few mo-
ments he would be on board his sloop

sailing to the south-

  a tiny shaft of fire streaked toward
him from the cliff edge wind fanned
his cheek and the bark of a rifle was
in his ears pierre threw himself face
downward instinctively seconds went
by and then the head and unmistakable
shoulders of papinaw dupres appeared
where the path began its descent he
waited a moment before he advanced
trailing his rifle over the score of feet
that separated him from laflamme he
drew near cautiously

  pierre tensed his muscles to spring
then from the house behind him came
the voice of celeste low and steady and
determined

  hold up your arms papinaw or i
will kill you where you stand
thb bitter scar



  in the same instant pierre sprang
dupres leaped backward zigzagging
from side to side to spoil the aim of
celeste and raised his gun it was at
his shoulder when his foot stepped out
into empty air beyond the sharp brink
of the cliff he flung the rifle high
clutching at nothing and plunged head-
first from sight there was a rattle
of stones and a thud came faintly up
from the lake shore

  pierre laflamme went down the path
in jumps that sent an avalanche of dirt
and pebbles rolling before him be-
tween two bowlders he found a heap
that did not stir under his touch and
a glance told him that what he could
not keep from hoping was true papi-
naw dupres would trouble the world
no more

  up the path went pierre with spring-
ing sinews and yet with a weight upon

his heart celeste would be at peace
now but such a woman could hardly
look at his face with love in her eyes
it was soberly that he walked up to
her framed in the doorway of her
cottage

  he is dead celeste

  the rifle that she held clattered to
the floor

  dieu merci she breathed for
when you turned to go away to-night
i hated him again

 joy surged in choking waves upon
pierre as he understood

  in spite of this he cried trem-
bling as he pointed to his cheek

  it is the strong heart of pierre la-
flamme that i look at answered ce-
leste with shining eyes there is no
bitter scar there

  he held her close to him and the
world was filled with a song

golden notes and silvery bells

phamp clark the speaker of the house of representatives was lament-
ing that the exponents of the real old-fashioned oratory of the south had
disappeared from the halls of congress he pointed out that only practical busi-
ness men and hard-headed lawyers were being sent to washington by the south-
ern states

    the old school he said has left us and when it left it took from us
a sample of language which we never enjoy now there isnt a man in con-
gress who could get off a few sentences like those in a speech which i remember
senator bob talor of tennessee once made

    he then repeated this extract from taylors memorable effort

    i am from tennessee where the peach and cherry and every kind of berry
bends bough and bush and shines like showered drops of rubies and of pearls
i have seen heavens of delight where the linnet swept his lute and the thrush
rang his silver bells in the dusky chambers of the forest

    i saw june unbar her gate of roses in the sweet-scented morning and come
forth from the pavilion of enamored night carrying in her girdle of light the
keys of a thousand heavens i saw october open her gate of opals and i
walked in the heaven of autumnal glory

    i saw the forest splashed with the tints of a thousand shattered rainbows
and then i saw the veil of indian summer that mysterious phantom of the air
which conjures yellow sunlight into mystery and turns the world into a dream
business letters of a cowboy

    by robert v carr
    author of love letters of a cowboy  etc

dear miss kitty jimson

as you know when you come
back from the east you picked
me out from the whole bunch
here to ride with you and your paw
said it was o k also you called me
ruff right along instead of mister ruff
which a lady would do if she did not
care nothing for her esscort

  now i have been talking over our
case with a good friend of mine hank
todd by name and hank says that you
being a heiress makes you scared to
speak your mind to a man as there are
so many who want to marry you for
your money but i am not that soft-
soaping kind and you can see that this
is a business letter and not no soft soap
this letter will give you a chance to
speak your mind without no soft-soap
and i will say if your paw would give
me a start i would think it o k to
marry you i am all business and do
not feed no girl taffy as the saying
goes

 hank todd said-elmer talk
straight to her and give her a chance
to speak her mind women dast not
say what they think elmer for that
is the way they is raised you know
elmer you are a good-looking scoun-
drel and no girl let alone a heiress
can keep from being gone on you you
could not do better than marry miss
kitty as her paw is worth all kinds
of money though it is said he stole
the most of it if not all i know mis-
ter jimson would a heap rather have
his dorter marry a cow-puncher than
one of them rabbit-headed dudes from

down east tell her the facts elmer
be business right from the start

 then i said-but hank for why
does she always make me ride back of
her instead of up by her side

  hank then said-that is because she
dast not look at you for fear she will
show he- feelings that is a womans
way elmer i have knowed many and
many a girl and they all act about the
same way when they are gone on a fel-
ler they dont want to look at him
except maybe sideways out of the eyes

  then i said-but hank do you sup-
pose that it would make any diffrence
because she is educated and what little
i know i have got reading novels of a
rainy day

  hank then comes back-no elmer
this here love knows nothing about ed-
ucation love is liable to break out
any place just you go ahead and
write her a letter and consider your-
self as good as engaged to her

  i then said-but hank i am al-
ready engaged to a granger girl over
on little thunder and if i would go
back on millie that paw of hern would
come after my scalp as he is a shooting
son-of-a-gun

 hank then said-never you mind
about millie she is not your kind
her paw has got nothing and all she
knows is to stand and giggle and twist
her handkerchief while miss kitty is
a lady and will bring you a wagonload
of coin and thousands of cattle

  so i said-well hank that settles
it and i will write miss kitty and give
her a show to say what she thinks
business letters of a cowboy



while she is thinking i will consider
myself as good as engaged to her and
not go to see millie next sunday as i
was figgering on as i always give my
sundays to millie

  hank said-that is the checker el-
mer you got a good head on your
shoulders and are bound to be some-
thing above a dog of a cow-puncher

 and i said-now you have said
something hank

  so you can think it over miss kitty
and if you feel backward about speak-
ing your mind to me personally you
can set down and write it all out on
paper yours resp

elmer h ruff

  p s-you might tell your paw that
we are as good as engaged as that
would make it easy for me to tap him
for a little money to kind of get
squared up on before the wedding i
got a few little bills i would like to
square up before i get married you
can explain that to your paw better
than i can as he is such a queer old
gobbler that he i liable to misunder-
stand and think i want to marry you
for his money

  miss kitty jimson so that was
it you claim that you wanted me to
ride with you as a flunkey because the
girls what ride in the parks in the east
have a hired man a-follering them to
help them on and off their horses and
that was why your paw consented to
me riding with you well i want
to tell you something miss kitty jim-
son you have started a little deal that
will be hard for you and your paw to
finish

  you forgot that i has some reputa-
tion in this country and that because
of me riding around with you all the
folks on the range was saying we would
get married and now you claim you
thought no more of me than a hitching
post or words to that effect you were
like the englishman who thought a

cow-puncher was a cow-servant but
miss kitty you have got another guess
a-coming

  as far as you being engaged to that
feller in the east and having no idear
of encouraging me that does not go
with me for a minute for why would
a woman ride around over the country
with a man unless she thought he was
about right i am not like those east-
ern scrubs that think it all right for a
girl to ride around with a man who she
is not engaged to or married to i got
some self-respeck i have and what
is more i have writ a lawyer mister
ketchem and he will file soot against
you and your father for deceiving me
into telling around that you and me was
engaged when you was only using me
for a flunkey so that was it hey 
that was why you always had me ride
back of you hey well it will cost
your old dad just about  to
square it for a man has his rights as
well as a woman and i do not know
how many times i have read where a
woman brings soot against a man for
breech of promise and you will see
that it does not pay to deceive people
i may look foolish but you and your
paw will not think i am foolish when
i separate him from 

  as for you thinking you are above
me you do not want to forget that i
has as good blood in my vanes as ever
a jimson had and that on my mothers
side my grandfather was a preacher
and on my fathers side an auctioneer
and was called colonel fur and wide

  i see where and i say it without a
struggle that he is a idiot in some re-
specks i see where hank todd does
not know straight up we had some
words about the advice he give me and
he laughed and said-

  why elmer you poor gopher-headed
yap did not you not know i was load-
ing you that miss kitty does not
consider you good enough to dust off
her last years slippers which her maid


the pocpulacr magazine

has wore and throwed away i did not
think you took me serious as  sup-
posed you had some branes

  then i said-so you pertended to be
my friend while you was loading me
all along for a nickle i would step
back and give you a slam in the jaw

  hank then got a nickle out of his
pocket and said-here is your money
turn loose your slam but when you
do boy get ready for your funeral
while you and me have been good
friends there is something about you
that makes me want to see just about
how hard you would fall in case i
leaned my right into you

  i then walked away and left him for
i consider that hank todd a liar a
theef and no more my friend than a
rattlesnake and not as much for a rat-
tlesnake is a gentleman beside him and
always buzzes before he strikes

  but what i said about tapping you
and your paw for  goes and
you will see that it costs real money to
trifle with the affections of a honest
man if you was a man i could tell
you some things that would do you a
lot of good but as you are a woman
you can double-cross a man and he has
got to keep still

  but i want to say you have got noth-
ing to make you swell-headed as your
paw got his start by branding mavericks
so young that their mothers was horn-
ing him in the back while he was brand-
ing them and when you first come
to the country your paw was lucky to
have a clean shirt to put on and you
never had a shoe on your foot till you
was coming seven just where you got
any reason to think you are better than
me is more than i can see you just
got a smooth finish and a bunch of
money but when they take your money
away you are no diffrent from millie
jones and at least millie dont encour-
age a man and mean nothing and i am
beginning to see that maybe i did not
give millie a square deal but when i

start in to do something i am a stayer
and until i make your dad come
through with the money i will sure
hang and rattle yours resp

elmer h ruff

  miss kitty jimson  you have sure
give me a good case now and my law-
yer will win jjiy soot against you and
your paw without no trouble as along
with the breech of promise i have got
asault with a stake from a wood rack
with intent to kill and i would want
nothing better

  you must have told your paw about
me as he come down to the bunkhouse
i was just getting ready to leave any-
way but before i could say a word he
come at me like a gray-headed tornado

  before i could square back and tap
the old loonatick he had me out in the
lane i recollect that he hit me twice
once in the bunkhouse and once in the
nose etc when he got me out in the
lane he was using a stake from a wood
rack i tried to tell him that the only
thing that saved him was that he was
on his own ground and that i knowed
he would have the best of it at law if
i would tap him on his own ground
i just held my temper and it was not
long before i was quite a ways ahead
of him as he is a little short-winded
i could have run him to death if i had
wanted to

  because i has some sentimental rec-
ollections for you regardless of how
you treated me i did not poke your
paw had i poked him once my law-
yer would have had to clear me for
murder and that is no joke when i
land on a man with my weight behind
it there is nothing left to do but walk
around and view the remanes

  all the time your paw was working
me over with that wood rack stake
he was bawling-

  telling around that you was engaged
to my girl you half-baked hoss-han-
dler you i would not let you sociate
business letters of a cowboy



with no dog of mine if i had any re-
speck for the dog dont let me kill
you run before i do murder

  so as to not have no more trouble
i did as he asked you can address
me general delivery as i am not stop-
ping at no regular hotel at present

               yours resp

elmer h ruff

  p s-if you should think it over
and want to make up with me i would
tell my lawyer to cut out the soot for
 in case you would change
your mind and get your paw bedded
down so he dont jump and strike so i
would consent to marry you if he would
deed me the north ranch and give me
a start say with  twos and enough
cash money to go on but if he will
not listen to reason he can exspeck to
have to go down in his sock and drag
up that  as i need a little
change about now

  miss kitty jimson  just to let you
know that i know that your little dude
friend you claim to be engaged to is
out to the home ranch and that you
are riding around with him and not
caring what people say about you be-
ing one of them vampires that rides
with a new man every day or so

  you had better not let me see your
little rich friend or i am liable to bust
a dewdrop on his head or beat him to
death with a hummin birds feather
just because his paw is a millionaire
and owns a oatmeal factory is no sign
he can get away from me as he is fur
from home and not on his own ground

  you better lock your little clarance
boy up or something is liable to get him
of nights

yours resp

elmer h ruff

  p s-as i have not heard from
your paw concerning bis giving me a
start i am going to take it up with him
by mail this afternoon but my lawyer

will bring soot for the money as stated
unless your paw listens to reason and
gets some of that foolish pride out of
his system i hear he is telling around
that he would rather see you in your
grave than married to a drunken cow-
puncher like me i suppose your paw
your nice old paw dont drink for
thirty years he has never dared to go
to bed without a quart at hand and he
is parboiled in alcohawl as for me
being a drinking man i can say that
i have gone as high as three months
on the range without touching licker
as we could not get it but your paw
would come around with plenty of good
licker under his buckboard seat and do
you suppose he would offer a rider a
little drop of kindness nothing doing
with your paw for he would not give
away nothing unless it was a clout 
the head and yet he goes around per-
tending that he is a regler human
being

  miss kitty i have writ your paw
and he has consented to meet me in the
county seat and give me a start so
that settles it your little clarence boy
had better pack up his kimona and blow
back east for if ever i see him i am
liable to slap him to sleep with a ciga-
reet paper now that your paw has
agreed to give me a start i will have
my lawyer cut down my soot to say
 as i will need about that much
money to go on

yours resp

elmer h ruff

  p s-i got to thinking that maybe
it would be best for my lawyer to cut
down my soot to  as i need
some cash money now and could use
it to a advantage you might kind of
feel around your paw as regards
amount of cash money i am to have
when i marry you what i do not
understand is why you dont anser my
letters it would not hurt you to cor-
respond backwards and forwards so


the popular magazine

that we would understand each other
lets hear from you

  miss kitty jimson as i said be-
fore i am a business man and believe
in laying all my cards on the board
and it is no more than right that you
should know what kind of a deal your
paw and that very large financie of
yourn give me

  in the first place your paw did not
give me the start i figgered on he
met me at the county seat and he had
your financie with him he called
your financie rollo i once knowed a
newfoundland dog by the name of
rollo and your financie is made on the
same principil as a newfoundland dog
only a newfoundland dog is not so
crool

  you deceived me about your finan-
cie i thought he was one of them sissy
dudes with a rich paw but he is not
no sissy for he is the biggest hardest
critter i ever see stood up on two hoofs
i suppose he is a pleasant sort when
you come to know him but i do not
care to get intimately a-quainted with
no such a critter

  as i said your paw did not give me
no start of any kind had he give
me any kind of a start he would not
have caught me and dont you forget it
he got me before i could break into a
run as i would not have it said that
elmer h ruff hit a old man of
course if i had got away and he took
after me and i run him to death that
could not be held against me

  well after your paw and me had a
little catch-as-catch-can exercise he
turns to your financie rollo and he
says-

  rollo whats the matter of you tak-
ing this off my hands i am getting
a little short-winded in my old age and
cannot romp around like i used to

  then rollo said-mister jimson is
this what has been annoying katherine
with what he calls business letters

  mister jimson your paw handed me
to rollo and said-

  that is it and look it over and
when you are through with it throw
it outside the city limits as there is a
law in this town against leaving such
as that a-laying around

  rollo then took me and placed my
head some way in the holler of his
arm and it was like i had my head in a
boot jack

  then your financie rollo said-
ever since i left college i have wanted
to examine the head of a cowboy and
by your leave i will look yours over
fernologists tell us that by the bumps
on a mans head you will know him
i can see that your head needs polish-
ing off and smoothing down also
your hair-line elmer comes down too
fur on your forehead i-will proceed
to push back that hair-line so that you
have a look of compartive intelligence
after which i will polish the head

  he then took the heel of his hand
and pushed my forehead back till i
could have kissed the back of my own
neck then he started in polishing my
head with his hand the same as a cham-
bermaid polishes a winder i cant say
that i was thinking about anything
much for your financie is a man that
takes up a fellers mind as it were

  but all the time i was working
around to get my gun thinking to shoot
my way out of his loving embrace
but when he saw what i was after he
took my gun and looked at it pleased-
like

  he then said-elmer i did not think
you was a dope fiend but how can i
doubt my eyes when here in my hand
is the siringe i will have to give you
a shot in the arm for i see that is what
you need

  and i be dogged if he did not take
my sixshooter and hold it like a hiper-
dermick siringe and pertend to give me
a shot in the arm

  he then said-i now see the cause
business letters of a cowboy



of you writing so many letters you
arc a hop-headj for letter-writing is a
sure sign of hasheesh

  i said-i have not had no hasheesh
and what i write is just business

  he then said-go on i love to hear
you talk i never heard such a in-
spiring talker i can feel my arm get
twice at strong when you talk

  he then felt my head over again
and tunked it like a grocery man does
a watermelon he is a head feeler
rollo is if a person dont care what
they say

  rollo then turned to your paw and
said-mister jimson shall i give it my
compliments just once and your paw
nodded his head and said he was tired
of looking at me in a vertical position
rollo then placed me where he wanted
and kissed me on the forehead like he
was saying good-by forever which he
had my consent to do and then some-
thing happened i dreamed i run
against a wagon tongue in the dark
and when i woke up who should i see
standing there but mister jones and
millie and mister jones had a -
sharpes and he was peevish about
something

  mister jones said-what do you
mean by lying there in the weeds with
your toes turned up like a kangaroo
and why have you not kept your prom-
ised word to my little millie here
for three sundays hand-running you
have not showed up at our place and
millie had set at her winder and cried
herself sick do you not think i have
no pride you scuff of creation do
you think i would con-sent to your call-
ing on my dorter and then back out at
the last moment if that is what you
think you got a good chance to do your
thinking as a corps

  i then set up and said-why mis-
ter jones how you do talk i never
had no idear of going back- on millie
the reason i staid away was because
i had business on hands

  and miss kitty if mister jones
ever asks you about it please tell him
it was as i said-business on hands
although he is now my paw-in-law
he is a proud old cuss and would just
as soon lay that old sharpes across a
fence and blam loose at a son-in-law
as he would to down a maverick when
in need of beef or slow elk as the say-
ing goes

  then mister jones said-come now
elmer my dorter says that she wants
you for a husband and i always aim
to humor my little girl we will go
right to the preachers as soon as we
get a permit but let me say when you
become my son-in-law you cant come
to my place and lay down and eat my
grub without making a showing that
you are worth it i reequire that my
son-in-law get out and rustle for i
would hate to have to pull down on
him in my own home and make millie
a widder

  he then turned to his dorter millie
and said-millie is this the man you
was mourning for i cant say i ad-
mire your taste but i am a indulgent
father and you shall have what i can
get you

  millie then said-paw with all his
faults i love him still

  we then formed up a procession and
they took me over to the preachers
and married me

  coming back we met your paw and
rollo your financie rollo was about
to feel my head again when i told him
i was married

  he then shook my hand and said-
elmer you are now safe from me as
i am about to be married myself i
could not work over the head of a fel-
ler married man on second thought
i will give the bride a kiss and he did
millie brightened up considerable for
your financie seems to have a good
deal of experience in many things

  then i said to your paw-mister
jimson you and me have had words


the popular magazine

and i brought soot against you but i
now take it all back as i am married
and at peace with all the world

  then your paw took out his check-
book and wrote a check out to millie
as a wedding present and he said-

  missis ruff put that money in bank
and dont let that worthless scrub of a
husband of yours have a cent of it

  then rollo said-i will write a check
for the same figures you did mister
jimson and give it to the fair little
bride

  and he did

  all the time i was looking at millie
and it come fo me that she was about
right and that i had been a little fool-
ish to think that you and me could get
along

  so i wish you well and everything
is o k as far as i am concerned

  only regret that i have is that when
i had him dead to rights that i did
not step back and swing on your paw
and drive his nose around so he could
use it for a collar button but let
by-gones be by-gones i say but the

next time you deceive a poor cowboy
into thinking that you care for him in-
stead of wanting him for a spotted dog
to run under the buggy you want to
pick a diffrent man than
yours truly

elmer h ruff

  p s-you need not think there is
anything in these letters that can be
held against me in case you might think
to bring soot against me as i writ noth-
ing but business and cant be held re-
sponsible other men as i read in the
papers have writ letters to women and
been jerked up in court and made to
pay big money but i never writ noth-
ing compromising for i know women
and their ways and am wise and you
do not want to forget that as long as
you live miss kitty jimson i now
see where millie has you beat and
was figgering all along on making mil-
lie jealous over you you thought you
was cute but when you trifled with
elmer h ruff you got a hold of a deep
proposition and i hope you commit that
to memory

       carrs next contribution lets you into the feelings of a cowboy
       whose girl leaves the range to join a moving-picture outfit
       dont miss the letters of a cowboy to a movie queen they
       are the funniest yet if you havent kept a complete set of
       these cowboy letters write for back numbers they appeared in

	to attend a methodist watch-night
service you will doubtless remember
the old hymn that begins come let

us anew our journey pursue-- this

number of the magazine finds us in the
same frame of mind is the small hours
of new years morning finds the good
methodist we are girding up our
loins starting out on another clean page
of the history of the popular hoping
-and with reason too-to make it the
best and most interesting page yet it
seems a long time ago that the first
new years number of the popular
came out the magazine was a good
deal smaller then and we had little
idea of the big future it had before it
we had the right idea though we
proved it the popular during the
past ten years has been steadily and
consistently the most successful fiction
magazine that we know of it is going
to be still more successful in the fu-
ture we have the same idea only
now it is bigger and means more and
we have better means for putting it into
effect

a a

overy publisher says substantially
the same thing i am going to
publish the best fiction written but
words are peculiar things they mean
different things to different people it
is what the publisher means when he
says it that counts and makes the differ-
ence to one it may mean a hunt for
prominent names among fiction writers
to another it may mean a feverish ef-
fort to be timely at all costs and to
reflect in his fiction every sudden flow
and eddy in the wind of public inter-

est to a third it may represent a ruth-
less application of rules and academic
standards that will result in stories that
tell us nothing written in the prose of
addison or matthew arnold we have
no such ideas no matter who writes a
story we dont want it unless it is the
sort of a story you like no matter
how timely a tale is we dont want it
unless it has some quality that would
make it interesting aside from its time-
liness no matter how well a story is
written it must be the sort of thing that
any one would listen to with interest if
it were told him to get by with us

 a

hat is it that makes a story good
  anyway  there are so many an-
swers to this that you will find whole
volumes of them on the shelves of al-
most any big library weve talked
about it in the past first from one angle
and then from another truth to life
there are many books painstaking in
their fidelity that can only be read as
they were written-with great pains-
taking incident there are yarns
packed with incident that make a noise
distantly resembling that of a good
story but fail to hold or convince
plot there are only a certain amount
of essential plots in all the fiction in the
world and of three stories with the
same plot one may be a stirring ad-
venture novel a second a roaring farce
and a third a dreary expanse of drivel
delineation of human character that
comes a little closer to being the great-
est of the essentials and yet there are
masterly analyses of character that have
found their way to the library shelves it
is true but are very seldom taken down
therefrom
a chat with you-continued

the great point is the method in
which the impression of character
is conveyed to us fabre the french-
man knew more and told more about
insects than any one he did not ar-
rive at his knowledge by dissecting the
insects he lay face on elbows over
an ant hill studying the little lives be-
neath him their romances their trag-
edies their matings and partings and
his scientific works are of transcendent
value because they are stories of inci-
dent to get back to the methodist at-
mosphere for a moment we know the
character of david in the bible about
as well as any character that has ever
been described we are wont to say
that david was intensely human he
was most human and inconsistent both
good and bad and yet nowhere does
the author of chronicles or kings tell
us so he shows us david in action
and lets us see and find out the sort of
man he was these most widely read
books are stories of incident and action
shakespeare next to the bible is most
universally read does he tell us any-
thing about iago or try to analyze his
feelings  does he anywhere character-
ize macbeth in so many words he lets
them tell their own stories and act them
before us so that any one will soon
know one for the consummate scoun-
drel and the other for the ambitious
weakling

  hamlet is such a wonderful study of
human character that goethe devoted a
great part of his greatest novel to its
discussion and whole shelves of books
have been written about it and yet the
play has incident and action enough to
furnish forth three or four of the most
lurid melodramas

a a

human life is not still life and it
is the peculiar privilege and great-
ness of fiction to show it in action
thats what we want to do in the fiction

we publish ferguson does it in the
big novel called an frregular game
which appears complete in the next
issue of thk popular he does not
waste much time in describing the char-
acters of the two secret-service men
who lind themselves in the strange craft
among the shoal waters off holland but
we soon know all about them the
author is content to introduce them to
us and then let them act and talk for
themselves victor maxwell in the
great detective story in the same issue
shows us a remarkable woman criminal
and the man who pitted his brain against
hers he doesnt talk about them he
tells us what they did you learn far
more about captain slocum from what
he says and does than from anything
stacpoole tells us about him in the
series of south sea tales now running
character just by itself incident just by
itself-neither of these is sufficient and
each becomes a weariness alone they
must be blended and united to make a
really satisfying story even this talk
which we hope isnt getting tiresome
would be a thousand times more inter-
esting and understandable if we or
some one else could only put it in the
form of a short story

a a

mineteen-sixteen is going to

	 be a big year for the popular
we are starting it well and the maga-
zine will get better and better as it goes
on it isnt just that we want to make
it so or plan to make it so we see our
way clear to doing it well prove it
from month to month and perhaps
within an issue or so we will discuss
some of our plans in greater detail in
the meantime the next issue is one of
the best yet it is going to sell very
fast and you can help us and the news

e are living in the united states
  of hustle between the hammer
of the automobile and the anvil of the
moving picture the line art of leisure
-with pipe book and log fire-seems
in a fair way to be crushed jumpy as
a grasshopper we are always on the
go it is as characteristically ameri-
can as ice water pullman sleepers and
ward politics

 to the mind which plumbs the
depths instead of the shallows theres
music in the bawl of
the rowdy minds
outside while you
prawl right and
tight inside
wrapped in a cozy
dressing gown
steepling fingers and
building castles in
havana or virginia
as the smoke floats
ceilingward

  it is a bromidiom
to say that they do
such things so much
better abroad but
those older and
staider civilizations
certainly know how
to dawdle doze and
dream and loung-
ing almost rises to
the solemnity of a
religious rite among
the best-turned-out
men overseas until
they exchanged
comforts for khaki
and trenches

  quite naturally the growth of wealth
and taste in our own country among
all classes has brought with it a great
increase of luxury in mens dress we
are more fastidious because we are
more observant any new fashion
spreads like fire among timber the
day when a style could be kept exclu-
sive among a narrow coterie has
passed this is just as noticeable
among the clothes worn indoors as out

  present-day house gowns room
robes and apart-
ment suits - for
city dwellers - are
very smart gar-
ments tailored with
all the care and
finesse of the most
pretentious evening
coat

  among the fab-
rics most used are
velvets vicunas
corduroys blanket-
ings camels hairs
soft woolens surah
and pongee silks

 house clothes
may be simple or or-
nate according to
personal taste
though studied elab-
orateness hints dis-
agreeably of effemi-
nacy the spirit of
the day is so dis-
tinctly virile that it
frovyns upon any at-
tempt to ape the

should be freer in fit than an outdoor
suit but nevertheless they should fit
and look as though made for the
wearer

  dressing gowns are cut much like an
overcoat being shaped at the waist and
full and flowing of skirt they have
shawl collars silk cord girdles turn-
back cuffs and if you like a mono-
gram may be embroidered on the breast
pocket

  considering the mingled usefulness
and fitness of house clothes they de-
serve to be more generally worn while
one may go as high as one pleases in
price there are many inexpensive gar-
ments for the man who has to count
cost and cannot let his taste outrun his
means

  hunting is no end of a strain be it
for bird or bear it sets nerves as well
as fingers on trigger the snap of a
twig or the lurch of a stone may betray
you so the grizzled veteran peels
down to the irreducible minimum
the less he has on his body the less he
has on his mind

  time was when we looked across to
england for our hunt clothes but the
spread of sport in this country brack-
eted with american quick-wittedness
is putting us in the forefront as de-
signers of the best special-type gar-
ments befitting each purpose

  english sport clothes though of ex-
cellent material and make are prone to
be heavy and clumsy while lightness
and freedom of arm and aim are all-
important in hunt garments

  a new hunt jacket unites the most
warmth with the least weight the
body is cheviot with a knitted neck
that buttons up right and tight and
knitted wrists the sleeves and lining
are soft ooze leather and the outside
