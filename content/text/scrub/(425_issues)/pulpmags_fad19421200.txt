 washing h eres a tip from the lips of thousands of men and women who have been helped by the listerine treatment as a part of every shampoo either preced- ing or following it as you prefer use full strength listerine antiseptic followed by
vigorous and persistent massage

  the minute listerine antiseptic reaches
scalp and hair it kills literally millions of germs
including the stubborn bottle bacillus recog-

   if the infectious type of dandruff has really
made headway on your scalp repeat the
listerine treatment at least once a day twice
a day is better you will be amazed to find how

quickly the distressing flakes and scales and
the annoying itch begin to disappear

  remember that  of the sufferers in a
clinical test showed either complete disap-

symptoms of dandruff at the end of four weeks

a confidential chat with the editor

this column has reported many fantastic
true stories but we think that the other
day we ran into one of the most fantastic
of them all anyway its worth reporting if not
for the sake of the fantastic at least as good
americanism

  we visited milwaukee wisconsin on satur-
day september  and while there picked up a
copy of an evening paper conspicuously on the
front page was the report of a forum talk at
the milwaukee community forum the guest
speaker was a german woman refugee who told
of the cruelties and bestialities of the nazi regime
from its earliest days its disastrous impact on
morals religion and education its treachery and
deceit and its assault on the whole code of ethics
the speaker was mrs ida roetter

whats fantastic about that you ask noth-
ing certainly its something ail americans
know and do not question weve had those facts
displayed before our horrified eyes until we have
risen as one determined to stamp their reality
from the face of the earth forever or at least
thats what your editor thought up to now but
as we read on we entered a true world of fantasy
and we staggered out of it filled with confusion
and we admit a feeling of growing rage because
the reaction to that refugee womans tragic story
was this

her talk was received coldly except for occa-
sional grunts of disbelief and incredulous
laughter  and when she had finished these ques-
tions were put to her is there any evidence
that hitler ever intended to attack the united
states and isnt that just clever propaganda such
as directed against the kaiser in the last war

   are germans fond of the japanese and vice
versa or is it just another temporary friendship
such as between russia and germany  is
hitler a powerful speaker    arent we de-
fending communism by helping russia   
isnt it true that the only country that has ever
attacked the united states is england   
what else could germany do than fight when
england threatened to wipe her off the face of
the earth    has any man in any country the
right to freedom and the right to his life   

there were other questions all as incredible

mrs roetter could not answer them naturally
she had believed herself in america among ameri-

cans but your editor intends to answer theml
right here

in that despicable book mein kampf hitler
declares his intentions against democracies
we are a democracy hitlers own statement is
not propaganda but perhaps  or more of
our merchant vessels sunk in the atlantic is better
proof of his intentions and the attack on green-
land and the attack on iceland as for the
german friendship with russia we wonder if the
questioner has heard of moscow of leningrad of
stalingrad of  russian casualties of the
most furious and bloody battles in history no
hitler is not a powerful speaker he is the bellow-
ing hoarse-voiced gesturing type that causes
americans to grin with amusement in fact
weve heard americans laugh right out loud when
they first heard hitlers voice on the radio as
for defending communism by helping russia we
certainly are not we are defending democracy
russia fights-and howl-against our enemy we
would be fools not to make her effort even more
effective we damned well appreciate the existence
of the russians and whatever their political set-up
isv has nothing to do with getting in there and
helping do our share to make that russian pile-
driver even more mighty as for the u s being
attacked has the questioner never heard of pearl
harbor of the aleutians of the philippines of
corregidor of bataan of wake island of mid-
way or to go back further of the spanish-
american war

when we come to answering the question as
to what else could germany do   we
humbly suggest that she might have avoided mur-
der rape ruthless destruction tyranny treachery
bestiality and every other despicable thing she
has done she might have worked rather than
fought she might have dealt rather than de-
stroyed she might have nursed progress rather
than killed it

 i he last question we cannot answer it is too
fantastic besides is has been answered by the
blood of millions of free men it has been an-
swered from the beginning of history has
any man in any country the right to freedom and
the right to his life we can only snortt

our heart goes out to poor mrs roetter
where now will she flee for safety and free-
dom she has come to the one country where
the editors notebook

she believed such things existed and to her horror
and terror as evidenced by her frightened be-
wildered tears in that milwaukee forum finds
she has not escaped at all

hphe most horrifying truth of all is that we
have freedom of speech in this country and
yet no one in milwaukee not even the paper
which reported this forum exercised that
glorious right and rose to answer those ques-
tioners it is lucky or unlucky that your
editor has not the power of a heydrich for
today those questioners would be dead stood
against a wall and shot-because it is impossible
for us to believe that they are americans to
assume so would be to attribute to them an
abysmal ignorance that is beyond comprehension

oerhaps all the foregoing is a fitting introduc-
tion to william p mcgiverns sensational story
in this issue the ghost that haunted hitler
we believe that we have a story here that will
set you to thinking and that will stir you deeply
your editor has read it several times and has
wondered much about it and has asked mr
mcgivern many questions about it but he seems
strangely reticent especially as to its source or
inspiration if mr mcgivern has a secret here
we have failed to worm it from him what do
you think

ihen it comes to taking advantage of an
 existing situation and turning it into a humor
story with real punch we think david wright
obrien has quite a knack youll like pegasus
plays priorities in this issue no its not about
a horse    just go ahead and read it for a
real treat

derhaps weve laughed so much at lefty feep
that weve felt we just couldnt any more but
believe us when the current feep episode hit our
desk we were in for some sore ribs lefty feep
and the sleepy time gal is right up our funny
bone itll murder you

d ecently married dwight v swain has
 written a story around that old subject the
fabulous memory of elephants except that this
storys about those little silver bells elephants
wear these particular bells had a strange power
and plenty happened when they came to chicago
plenty we say  so dont skip this one

tie sent an illustration to edmond hamilton
 and asked him to do a story around it the
result was lost city of burma we expect a
lot of fan mail on this story because it has some
very unusual writing and plotting in it we
assure you it wont wind up where you might
imagine it would it has that old surprise sock
youll enjoy it

 jphere are four stories in this issue which have
 some foundation in the war madagascar
 ghost is one of them written by clee garson
 recent headlines told of action in madagascar by
 the british this island has always been hooked
 up with weird tales of mysterious things that
 happen in its seas and its jungles and here is one
 of them related in a modern setting it is calcu-
 lated to chase little chills up and down your spine
 and we believe it will

 voull note we have eleven complete stories
 in this issue we havent mentioned the others
 but all are specially selected to make this issue
 one of the biggest and best youve ever had we
 think we started this one off right by putting the
 mac girl on the cover to illustrate mcgivems
 great story incidentally a peculiar truth is given
 the example in this painting most painters find
 themselves painting their own likeness into their
 paintings sometimes deliberately but many times
 unconsciously mccauley has done this here the
 shadowy figure is none other than the artist him-
 self

 incidentally the other night your editor
 drove his secretary out to mccauleys studio
 and we posed her for a cover which is now being
 painted well let you know when its to appear
 we think that when it does youll agree that the
 most lovely mac girl of them all works right op-
 posite our own desk if youre ever in town drop
 down and prove it to yourself incidentally wed
 be glad to show you around the office and
 demonstrate how your favorite magazines are
 put out

by

william p mcgivern

a guttering candle flamed in
the dank darkness of the cellar
casting grotesque shadows
against the limestone walls

  three men sat at a table in that cel-
lar

  the man at the head of the table
leaned forward and for an instant his
face was strikingly lighted by the
flickering candle

  his face was lean and pale the
jaw-line was sharp and hard a thin
nose jutted over a slight blonde mus-
tache the eyes of the man were only
mirrored pools of blackness

  he glanced down at the map lying
before him on the table

  every detail has been arranged he
said his voice was softly cautious
he will be here in prague tomorrow

  the man on his left leaned forward
tensely the candle-light caught the
blazing glints in his black eyes the
almost savage determination in his
grimly clamped jaw his thick fingers
gripped the edge of the table

  are you sure he whispered can
we trust our information

  the man opposite the speaker a

heavy-shouldered dark-browed giant
nodded thoughtfully

  can we be sure he growled we
will have only one chance his eyes
turned to the man at the head of the
table one slip now will ruin every-
thing

  the man at the head of the table
glanced briefly at the two men and a
faint ironic smile brushed his thin
lips

  yes we can trust this information

  he bent over the map deliberately
the candle light penetrated the shad-
owy caverns of his eyes as he leaned
forward transforming them into yellow
pools of strange luminance there was
something haunting about those green-
yellow eyes something about their
weird glow in the darkness that was
chilling they were the eyes of a

   although this story is presented purely as fic-
tion author william p mcgivern displayed a
strangely fervent eagerness that it be presented to
the public at the earliest possible moment this
story must be published he said forcefully we
as editors smiled read the story agreed that it was
a good story and we publish it here but the other
day we were introduced to a man who spoke
with an accent later we discovered that this
man had sought out mcgivern now we
wonder    -ed


fantastic adventures

creature of darkness the eyes of a
hunter

  we can trust this information he
said underground intelligence from
berlin transmitted it to me heydrich
will be in prague tomorrow

  the dark-browed giant stood up sud-
denly mighty fists clenching

  the hangman he grated his
men took my wife my child-

  the man at the head of the table
took his arm and drew him back to his
seat

  i know he said softly but the
hangmans hour of reckoning draws
closer with each tick of the clock now
you have both studied this map of the
city and the route heydrichs car will
take are you sure of what you must
do

  the two men nodded silently
excellent i will be on hand
when your-ah-errand is completed
i will give you your instructions for
leaving the city i think that is all
gentlemen good luck

  the man on his left drummed his
fingers nervously on the top of the
table his smouldering black eyes were
worried

  you say you will be there

  yes

  but you cant the neighborhood
will be alive with gestapo police sec-
onds after we have done our work it
will direct suspicion at you if you are
discovered in the vicinity

  im afraid that cant be helped
but you are one of our few links
with the reich authorities you are
worth a hundred of us as long as they
believe you a renegade american and
admit you to their councils you are
invaluable to the underground move-
ment nothing must happen to you
i dont intend letting anything hap-
pen to me the man at the head of the
table said a whimsical smile touched

his face but his yellow-green eyes did
not reflect that smile even so id
risk quite a bit to be present at herr
heydrichs final performance when
he departs for his eternal and-ah-
warm reward i want to be there to raise
a silent cheer

   he stood up slowly a tall thin figure
with the esthetic features of a scholar
and the yellow-green eyes of a jungle
hunter

  im afraid we must consider the
matter settled he said gently au
revoir until tomorrow my comrades

  with a slight smile he turned and
moved silently toward the cellar exit

  after a moment one of the men at the
table pinched out the candle and dark-
ness close and final settled pall-like
over the damp cellar   

a t five oclock on the afternoon of
may twenty-eighth a german
staff car entered the outskirts of prague
and followed one of the main boule-
vards leading to the center of the city

  the car was driven by an impassive
german officer and the sole occupant of
the tonneau was a thin loose-lipped
man with pale fretful features and
cold shifting eyes he wore the insignia
of a reich upper group leader and his
narrow chest was covered with medals
and decorations

  as the car approached an intersec-
tion a stocky black-haired man on a
bicycle swung out into the boulevard
and pedaled leisurely along the street
directly in front of the staff car

  the chauffeur applied the brakes
slowing the car he sounded the horn
impatiently swearing under his breath

   the man in the rear of the car looked
up his cold eyes snapping a muscle
twitched nervously in his cheek

  what is the matter he barked

  the chauffeur gestured helplessly at
the slowly moving bicyclist
the ghost that haunted hitler



  i am sorry sir but this fool ahead
on the cycle is blocking the street
perhaps he is deaf he sounded the
horn again pressing angrily with the
flat of his hand

  the officer in the rear of the car
leaned back against the cushioned seat
a smile played about his loose lips
and his unnaturally pale face lighted
with a strange eagerness

  how unfortunate for him he mur-
mured run him down

  but excellency-

  silence the single word cracked
like a leash about the chauffeurs ears
you have your orders

  red-faced the chauffeur jammed his
foot on the accelerator but as the
heavy car started to gain momentum
the bicyclist suddenly swerved to one
side leaving the road clear for the staff
car

  the officer in the rear of the car
cursed softly and his flabby lips twisted
in a pout

  the stupid fellow has saved his
life he muttered he crossed his
booted leg nervously and for
what i would have been doing him
a favor by crushing him beneath the
wheels xf the car what can life pos-
sibly mean to such a senseless inferior
clod only a succession of hungry
days and miserable nights stretching on
forever he is helpless to help himself
or to hurt others he lives without
power without effect without im-
portance better not to live

  as the car drew abreast of the man
on the bicycle he glanced idly at the
rider boiling black eyes met his for
one chilling instant eyes set in a hard
tensely determined face eyes without
fear eyes that gleamed like flashing
sword points

  the officer saw the man on the
bicycle reach into the folds of his coarse
jacket and draw out a round black

object and he suddenly screamed
madly at his chauffeur

 man on the opposite side of the
street a dark-browed giant of a
man stepped suddenly from between
two buildings he drew a gun from his
pocket and sighted deliberately at the
figure in the tonneau of the staff car
his gun barked five times

  almost at the same instant the arm
of the cyclist flashed up and down and
a small black ball smashed against the
hood of the car

  a reverberating explosion shattered
the air

  the car rocked from the force of the
blast the chauffeur fell forward over
the wheel and the machine careened
madly over the sidewalk and smashed
its hood into the glass showcase of a
small shop

  the man on the bicycle pedaled
swiftly across the street to the man who
had fired the shots into the car

  did you get him he snapped

i think so come we must hurry
not yet the man who had thrown
the bomb shot an anxious glance up and
down the street he said he would
be here to give us directions

  maybe he has failed something
might have happened to him

  he will not fail us

  already people were appearing on the
quiet street emerging from the neat
homes and small shops that lined the
boulevard two men were running to-
ward the wreckage of the car

  a cart with a load of hay turned onto
the boulevard from a side street and
the driver stopped the horses near the
wrecked car the driver clambered
down without haste he was wearing
frayed overalls and a straw hat and his
thin features were set in dull stoic lines

  the man with the bicycle gripped
his huge companions arm as the tall


fantastic adventures

figure of the driver strode toward them

  he has not failed us i he whispered
tensely

  what do you mean

  the overalled figure stopped in front
of them

  please accept my congratulations
he said you have done an excellent
afternoons work as a reward i would
suggest a quiet drive through the coun-
try and-ah-i wouldnt let anything
stop you from taking your reward im-
mediately

  the speaker lifted his straw hat slow-
ly and the last rays of the sun struck
lights in his strange yellow-green eyes
the faces of the two men gleamed
we knew youd come the dark-
featured giant said huskily where
shall we go

  the man in overalls glanced lazily
across the street at the wreckage of the
car noting the gathering of men and
women and listening to the growing tu-
mult spreading along the boulevard

  lli i were you he said thoughtfully
id drive slowly away from this tur- 
bulent place and find some quiet se-
cluded village and remain there youll
find the peace and quiet good for your
souls for that purpose i cant think
of a better place than the lazy pleasant
village of lidice

  lidice

  yes theyre expecting you now
get started at any moment the genial
gentlemen from the gestapo will arrive
and in their charming fashion begin the
questioning of witnesses

  but you

  the yellow-green eyes glinted with
amusement

  when the gestapo police arrive i
shall be the only one present with an
accurate description of the assassins
who i shall swear were eight in num-
ber and possessed of hairy ringed tails
now go quickly god be with you

chapter ii

n the morning of june fifth there
was an undercurrent of suppressed
excitement and tension in the offices of
the reichs minister of occupation
marshal wilhelm von bock

  the tension was not localized how-
ever in the imposing white-facaded
building that marshal von bock had
appropriated from the czech govern-
ment but it was evident in all parts of
prague reflected in the submissive eyes
of women and the sullen bitter eyes of
men

  the death of reinhardt heydrich
the protector of czechoslovakia had
been announced the day before and al-
ready three hundred and fifty innocent
men and women of prague had been
executed in wholesale retaliation

  in the imposing inner sanctum of
reichs minister von bock far from
the bloody street scenes far from the
tragic-eyed men and women of prague
this matter of reprisal was being dis-
cussed coldly deliberately

  marshal von bock was pacing slowly
in front of his magnificent mahogany
desk on the wall behind the desk an
immense swastika flag hung from the
ceiling to the floor the marshal was
a short gross man with a distended
stomach and heavy oily jowls in his
elaborately emblazoned uniform he
looked ridiculously like a strutting pig-
eon but there was nothing ridiculous
about the marshals pale ruthless eyes
and thick cruel lips

  this affair he was saying in his
soft slightly lisping voice presents an
interesting psychological problem do
you not agree herr faber

  he paused hands clasped behind his
back and peered down at the figure
sprawled comfortably in one of the
rooms thickly padded leather chairs

michael faber glanced up at the
the ghost that haunted hitler



marshal and smiled faintly his lean
face was tranquilly relaxed and his
yellow-green eyes were sleepily veiled

  but of course herr minister he
drawled if you continue the execution
of innocent citizens we shall soon know
exactly how far a people may be
goaded that should be valuable clin-
ical information if any of us are here
to appreciate it

  marshal von bock folded his pudgy
arms and shook his head despairingly

  my good herr faber he said woe-
fully you still have your curious
american respect for the common peo-
ple do you not after the things you
have seen in nazi countries you should
realize that the people are but a help-
less unimportant mass of atoms those
who guide and direct that mass of atoms
are the only important human beings
you worry about the people of prague
of czechoslovakia revolting bah
that is ridiculous we can grind them
to powder under our heels and they will
only whine for pity

tvtichael faber lit his pipe and
stared thoughtfully at the glowing
match as smoke swirled around his
head his hunters eyes caught the re-
flection of the match and gleamed
warmly under lowered lids

  what you say marshal he said
is undoubtedly true but what hap-
pened to heydrich can happen one day
to any of us

  a flicker of amusement touched his
face as marshal von bock suddenly
mopped his damp brow

  bah the minister said sharply
that was an accident he glanced
nervously over his shoulder and re-
sumed his slow pacing that was only
an accident he repeated when we
have completed our reprisals against
these swine they will know better than

to try a thing like that again

  will the reprisals consist simply of
murdering more czechs michael
faber asked

  marshal von bock stopped pacing
and regarded faber thoughtfully

  the word herr faber is not mur-
der he said softly

  a slip of the tongue michael said
lazily

  your tongue seems to be in the habit
of slipping herr faber von bock
said he folded his arms carefully
you have been helpful to us in numer-
ous ways but please remember that we
could if necessary do without you
herr faber in nazi germany no one
man is important

  michael raised his right arm lan-
guidly

  heil hitler  he murmured

  minister von bock flushed and
glanced nervously about

  i did not of course mean to include
our fuehrer in my statement he said
weakly i meant that only the fuehrer
is important in nazi germany it was
a slip of the tongue

  michaels eyes glinted with amuse-
ment

  bad habit he observed

  marshal von bock glared sharply at
him and then he resumed his pacing
mopping his perspiring brow as he
padded back and forth in front of his
desk

  let us forget this conversation he
said we were discussing reprisals
what our future policy will be i do not
know that is a matter for the reich
state to decide i am expecting word
from them any day now as to how to
proceed when a man as important as
heydrich is assassinated the means of
reprisal is for the fuehrer to decide
do you realize that this assassination
has given encouragement to all enemies
of the reich in europe if drastic and


fantastic adventures

effective reprisals are not instantly un-
dertaken a wave of this type of revolt
might sweep the continent and our
enemies abroad are mocking us we
must show them too what happens to
all enemies of the reich whether in
europe or across the seas

  as the marshal finished speaking the
heavy double doors of the office opened
and an under-officer entered and sa-
luted

  someone to see you herr minister
he said

  who is it marshal von bock said
if he does not have an appointment
send him away

  it is a woman herr minister she
asked me to give you this the under-
officer handed the minister a card

  marshal von bock glanced at the
card and his eyes narrowed

  send her in immediately he said
when the under-officer left he turned to
michael and his fat oily face was
agleam with excitement she is from
berlin from the office of heinrich
himmler

 jhe door opened again and a tall
red-haired girl entered the room
her features were as cold and white as
marble and her cool gray eyes were
without expression she was beautiful
michael noticed with an imperious
regal beauty that was without warmth
or appeal

  she walked slowly toward von bock
and her slender legs and body moved
in a flowing poem of motion

  the minister drew in his paunch and
snapped to attention his right arm
shot out

  heil hitler

  heil hitler the girl answered

  heil hitler murmured michael
around the stem of his pipe

  the girl glanced down seeing him
for the first time her cool gray eyes

studied him carefully deliberately then
she turned her gaze back to von bock

  you axe reichs minister von
bock she asked her voice was clear
and firm with just the faintest trace of
an accent

  that is right von bock answered
wont you be seated

  i prefer to stand i am marie kahn
from the office of reichs deputy hein-
rich himmler i have an important
communication for you in relation to
the assassination of upper group
leader heydrich who is this man
she gestured sharply toward michael
without looking at him

  he is the american michael faber
he has done much to help us in the past
two years you may speak before him
the girl glanced down at michael
and studied him coolly a faint sneer
touched her thin finely molded lips

  the american renegade eh she
turned back to von bock how can
you be sure of a man who is a traitor
to his country

  michael faber looked up at the girl
and his thin scholarly face was cyni-
cally amused but as he studied her
there was no amusement in swirling
depths of his hunters eyes

  you are an austrian are you not
he asked his keen ear had placed her
faint accent

  a spot of color appeared in the girls
marble-white cheeks

  what concern is that of yours
michael spread his hands in a care-
less gesture

  none at all he smiled lazily but
how my dear franlein can the nazis
be sure of your fealty since you are ad-
mittedly an austrian

  the girl turned furiously to von
bock every line of her slim body was
rigid with anger

  this i will not stand he has
questioned my loyalty to the reich to
the ghost that haunted hitler



our fuehrer i will make a report of
this incident herr minister

  now now von bock said sooth-
ingly we must not lose our tempers
and fight among ourselves the loyalty
of both of you is unquestioned he
rubbed his pudgy hands together you
have orders for me fraulein kahn and
here we stand wasting time in bicker-
ing

rjphe girl squared her slim shoulders

   her gray eyes were alive against the
whiteness of her face

  yes herr minister she said her
voice was even and cold you are
right my message to you is this in
reprisal for the cowardly assassination
of our beloved reinhardt heydrich the
village of lidice will be reduced to dust
the men will be immediately executed
the women sent to concentration camps
and the children will become wards of
the third reich that is all the de-
tails and arrangements are completely
in your hands herr minister

  michael faber lit his pipe thought-
fully and his lean fingers were as steady
as rocks

  why lidice he asked squinting
upwards through the smoke at the girl
its such a pleasant little town ive
always rather liked it

  our intelligence has discovered
that the assassins took refuge there
the girl answered coldly they may
still be hiding in the village

  they might at that michael said
thoughtfully

  this is delightful von bock said
musingly this is a fitting reprisal
we will erase the name of lidice from
the rolls of history and from the
memory of man our dive bombers
will leave nothing but a black scar in
the earth as a reminder to our enemies
of the fate of those who would stand
against us you may take back my

message fraulein i will carry out the
orders of my fuehrer to the last detail
lidice shall avenge the death of hey-
drich

  heil hitler marie kahn said

  heil hitler barked von bock

  michael faber tapped his pipe
thoughtfully against his teeth there
was no expression on his lean face but
there was a chilling light in the depths
of his smouldering yellow-green eyes

  heil lidice he murmured softly
under his breath

chapter iii

n june tenth a strong motorized
column roared along the concrete
strip of road leading to the village of
lidice in the lorries were scores of
expectantly grinning nazi storm troop-
ers several light tanks brought up
the rear of the procession above a
v-shaped flight of planes circled lazily
against the blue of the late afternoon
sky

  at the head of the swiftly moving
column in the tonneau of an armored
car rode marshal von bock and
michael faber

  you will see today a practical ex-
ample of nazi reprisals von bock said
to michael you will see what we can
do when our anger is aroused the
marshals hands were clasped com-
fortably over his protruding stomach
and he surveyed the passing country-
side with placid contented eyes i
think it would be a good idea herr
faber if you would broadcast to the
people of america what you will see
today yes i think that would be a
very good idea he turned to the
young party leader seated to his right
do you not think that would be a good
idea captain mueller

  captain mueller was a heavily built
young man with stone-hard features


fantastic adventures

and cropped blond hair he sat for-
ward on the edge of the seat his strong
brown fingers gripped tightly together

  why tell them about it he said
harshly his voice was thickly gut-
tural they will have first hand ex-
perience with our methods very soon

  you disagree with me then von
bock said mildly

  and what is your opinion herr
faber after all you are the propa-
ganda expert

  michael glanced sideways at the
tensely set face of the young captain
there was an amused glint in his eyes

  im afraid i must disagree with
our young captain he said a thing
like the annihilation of lidice will make
a deep impression on our enemies
they will never never forget it you
may count on that

  that is good captain mueller
said

  that is wonderful michael said
quietly

  the motorized column reached the
quiet village of lidice within the half
hour marshal von bocks car rolled
through the single main street scatter-
ing chickens and occasional live-stock
the remainder of the column stopped
at intervals along the dusty road and
grim-jawed heavily armed storm
troopers spilled out eagerly

  a child ran screaming into a small
cottage and the door was hastily
slammed frightened despairing faces
were visible occasionally at windows of
homes and shops

  it will soon be over von bock
said he was picking his teeth content-
edly the roastbrauten was under-
done today he observed thoughtfully

  captain mueller clambered from the
car and soon his young strident voice
could be heard bawling orders down
the line of stopped vehicles

  i think ill take a look michael

said if im to tell the american pub-
lic about this i shall want to be ac-
curate

  von bock chuckled appreciatively

jyichael stepped from the car and
glanced swiftly down the line of
lorries the troopers were entering the
houses at the far end of the village al-
ready he could hear the tortured
screams of women and children and oc-
casionally the hoarse tragic shout of a
man

  his lean face hardened and a merci-
less light flickered in his strange eyes
this was one more score to settle one
more crime to avenge

  with quick strides he crossed the
dusty street and ducked between two
buildings the storm troopers were
at the opposite end of the street work-
ing down in his direction

  he ran along the path between the
buildings when he reached the rear
of the building he vaulted a fence and
climbed the rickety stairs built against
the back of the filmsy wooden struc-
ture

  at the second landing he paused be-
fore a weather-beaten door and
knocked rapidly three times he
paused and then knocked twice slowly

  there was silence beyond the door
then a cautious shuffling step and the
door opened a crack the door was
flung open then and michael stepped
quickly into a small room fitted as a
laboratory

  a bent white-haired man sat at a
table littered with papers on which
designs and mathematical symbols
were scrawled there was dazed
pathetic bewilderment in his mild blue
eyes

  the man who had opened the door
gripped michael by the arm hot
black eyes blazed in his tense face

  for gods sake michael he said
the ghost that haunted hitler



what is it the shouts the screams
the truck loads of troopers what are
the devils up to now

  their usual trade michael said
bitterly murder he took the
mans arm paul i have failed you
i wasnt able to get here to warn you
von bock has stuck to me like a
postage stamp this last week the
nazis are here now to annihilate lidice
in retaliation for that bomb that blew
reinhardt heydrich to hell

  i threw that bomb the man said
simply i am sorry that innocents
must suffer but throwing that bomb
was the finest thing i have ever done
my bomb and henris bullets sent a
monster out of this world for that
i am proud

  where is henri michael asked
he went to the other end of the vil-
lage to get some tobacco swift
alarm flickered in his eyes is he-
im afraid he is in their hands
michael said they started at the op-
posite end of the street they will be
here in a very short while i am afraid
that this is the end paul there is no
escape

  paul glanced at the white-haired man
sitting at the table

  doctor schultz and i are ready to
go he said but you must not be
found here go back and join von
bock there is work yet for you to
do and you must remain alive to do
that work it is the most important
work in the world go quickly when
they find us-it will be all over in an in-
stant

ixait the white-haired man said
quietly he stood up slowly and
his knees trembled under the burden of
his frail undernourished frame there
were grooved lines of suffering in the
doctors face but there was a dignity
and nobility in his eyes that was as

clear as a beacon light over lashing
waves

  what is it doctor schultz
michael asked gently

  i can save one of you in my last
experiments with electrical dissemina-
tion of matter i developed a device
which renders opaque substances prac-
tically invisible to the naked eye the
old doctor paused thoughtfully i
did not disclose the results of my ex-
periments because i knew the nazi
regime would subvert my invention and
use it for their own brutal ends

  do you mean michael asked
tensely that you have a device that
will make a physical substance invis-
ible such as a human body
precisely the doctor nodded

  it seems incredible michael
breathed

  the doctor peered over his spec-
tacles

  there was a time he said when
i was considered as a rather good sci-
entist you know that seems a long
time ago

  not long enough for the world to
have forgotten your work in electro-
therapy doctor michael said crip-
pled children who have been restored to
health through your genius will never
forget you

i am glad the doctor said simply
but there is not time to talk of such
things now we must work quickly
but you paul said you could
save yourself with this device

  save myself for what the doctor
smiled gently there is no place for
me in nazi germany i am a healer
in nazi europe we need bomb-throw-
ers pistol-shooters men of courage and
strength you two are such men
thank you doctor michael said
simply he turned to paul there
is no time to lose you must take this
chance


fantastic adventures

  a sudden stacatto burst of machine
gun fire sounded from the street a
womans scream clear and terrible
pierced through the ugly roar of cough-
ing death

  they will soon be here the doctor
said quietly

  the eyes of paul were boiling pools
of rage and his hands were clenching
and unclenching spasmodically

  i must live he whispered i must
live i must strike again and again at
these swaggering swine nothing must
stop me that i swear by my mothers
cross

  the doctor hurried to a small closet
and returned in an instant with a small
compact device to which a metal head-
band was attached he slipped it down
over pauls head adjusted the band
firmly there were two dials on the
face of the small mechanism

  the operation is simple but there
are not a half dozen men in the world
today who could understand the prin-
ciple the doctor said quietly the
dial on the left turns the mechanism
on the right turns it off

  the tumult in the street was growing
louder by the second

  there is little time left michael
said

  the doctor snapped the left dial into
position and a faint humming noise
gradually sounded in the room

lyrichael watched tensely but
there was no visible change in
pauls appearance he forced his nerves
into calmness his ears heard the
shouts and running steps of men along-
side the building there was so little
time left   

  suddenly the faint humming noise
stopped michael looked sharply at
the doctor had something gone wrong

  he swung about to paul and an elec-
tric thrill shot through him

  paul had disappeared

  no his straining eyes made out a
faint outline a shadowy suggestion of
a human form where paul had stood

 can you hear me he asked
quickly

  yes paul answered i feel no
change

  michael tensed suddenly as he heard
booted feet pounding on the steps at
the back of the building

  back into the corner he hissed to
paul if i can i will get rid of them

  there is no chance the doctor said

  michael saw that the doctor was
holding a small revolver in his hands
there was a sad slow smile on his
seamed face

  how a man lives is not always im-
portant the doctor murmured but
how a man dies is always important
au revoir my friend the world is in
your hands may god give you strength
and wisdom

  without haste the white-haired doc-
tor placed the gun against his side and
pulled the trigger he was smiling as
he fell to the floor

  an instant later there was a clamor
outside and a heavy fist pounded might-
ily against the door

  open dogs a guttural voice
snarled open in the name of the
fuehrer

  michael bent and took the gun from
the doctors hand he wheeled toward
the corner where paul crouched a faint
barely discernible shadow in the gloom
of the room

  paul he whispered

  yes

  the underground pass-word has
been changed it is now the time is
near at hand do you hear

  yes the time is near at hand
i will not forget

  the door was trembling under the
shattering impact of a heavy fist a
the ghost that haunted hitler



hoarse bestial voice cried

  smash it down

  michael shot a quick look at the door
it would hold for another few seconds
but that was all

  meet me tonight at the transmit-
ter he whispered to paul luck

  he stepped quickly to the door gun
in hand and threw back the bolt the
door crashed inward and a gray-clad
storm trooper lunged into the room
tripped and fell forward on his face

  ah impetuous youth michael
murmured

rjhe stocky hard-faced captain
mueller strode into the room fol-
lowed by three soldiers with drawn
lugers the storm trooper who had
lunged through the door was picking
himself sheepishly from the floor

  captain mueller glared about the
room his pale eyes sweeping from the
doctors huddled figure to the gun in
michaels hand

  what is the meaning of this he
snapped you are getting yourself
into trouble herr faber

  trouble michael said raising one
eyebrow for shooting enemies of the
reich i hardly think so my young
captain i would suggest that you read
again the fuehrers mein kampf and
stop making ridiculous speeches

  a hot angry flush stained the thick
neck of the captain he glared savagely
at michael then shifted his gaze to the
body on the floor

  who is this man he snapped

  michael shook his head sadly

  i am surprised at you captain he
said this was the herr doctor
schultz he wrote and lectured inces-
santly against the doctrines of the nazi
state

  captain mueller looked slowly about
the room

  was he the only one here i am

looking for a paul cheval our intel-
ligence reported that he was hiding here
in lidice his pale eyes fastened on
michael

  you havent seen paul cheval have
you herr faber he asked

  that name is a familiar one
michael said thoughtfully but i
havent seen the man possibly he
slipped through your ranks and made
an escape

  impossible captain mueller re-
torted he glared about the room and
there was a puzzled suspicious expres-
sion on his hard features

  strange he said i feel that he
is here now

  disguised as one of your soldiers
michael suggested sarcastically

  captain mueller glared at him in
rage

  that tongue of yours will get you
in trouble yet he stormed he wheeled
to his men come we are wasting
our time here he gestured to michael
you had better come with us mar-
shal von bock will want an explanation
for this matter

  michael followed captain mueller to
the street he noticed that soldiers
were pouring gasoline about the wooden
bases of the buildings a worried line
creased his forehead paul was still in
the doctors laboratory and these build-
ings were veritable tinder boxes of
combustion   

  marshal von bock was standing be-
side his car a pleased relaxed expres-
sion on his swarthy oily face

  captain mueller saluted

  marshal there is something-

  marshal von bock waved him away
carelessly

  another time do not bother me
with details he took michael by the
arm and pointed down the street is
not that a pretty scene my american
friend


fantastic adventures

tvtichael had steeled his nerves
for the sight but an involuntary
shudder shook him as his eyes moved
over the spectacle of human savagery

  hundreds of machine-gunned bodies
were sprawled in the dust of the street
like tragic broken dolls storm troop-
ers walked among the pile of human
debris with fixed bayonets the blades
stained a dripping crimson red blood
was everywhere splashed on store
fronts sidewalks and street

  the women of the village were being
herded into trucks like cattle their
children were stripped brutally from
their arms and sent stumbling to the
outskirts of the village

  michael had seen ugly brutality
every day he had spent in nazi-domi-
nated lands but nothing he had seen
equaled this barbarous spectacle there
was something cold-blooded and un-
clean about this wanton butchery of
innocents this savage despoiling of
homes and children the lusting inhu-
man cruelty of this scene that brought
the blood pounding to his temples

  marshal von bock was watching him
carefully

  you do not seem particularly im-
pressed he said

  michael fought back his feelings
forced a mask of indifference over his
face he shrugged

  it is simply a job well done he
said

  that is right von bock said de-
lightedly it is a job well done the
village of lidice will be but a memory
in a few hours not one man escaped
and not one building will be left stand-
ing

  captain mueller said i am not so
sure that no men escaped i am afraid
that one did

  who von bock said sharply

  paul cheval a notorious saboteur
and undeground worker captain

mueller answered

  what makes you think he escaped
captain mueller looked uncomfort-
able it is just a feeling i have
bah von bock shorted you and
your feelings there is no place for
mysticism in your work captain
michael was watching the wooden
structure from which they had just
emerged flames were licking up the
wooden sides in greedy haste the en-
tire village would be a vast pyre for
the men whose lives had been sacrificed
in the name of the third reich

  suddenly through the curtain of
smoke and flame that obscured the
building he saw a faint shadowy figure
emerge the faintly visible form paused
for an instant and michael saw a shad-
owy arm raised in salute then the
vague shape moved rapidly away dis-
appearing around the corner of the
flaming building

  what are you looking at von
bock asked

  michael smiled but his cat-like yel-
low eyes were as sharp and hard as
pieces of flint

  nothing he said nothing at all
captain mueller ran a puzzled hand
through his cropped hair his thick
face wore a bewildered scowl

  there is something funny here he
said i still think the man we want
has made an escape

  michael smiled and patted the cap-
tains beefy shoulder

  wouldnt surprise me if you were
right he said

  captain mueller ran a hand over his
jaw and there was a thoughtful gleam
in his eyes as he studied michael faber

chapter iv

rjhe dark of late evening had settled
over the city of prague the guard
in front of the nazi propaganda build-
the ghost that haunted hitler



ing was leaning against his rifle when
michael faber arrived at the main en-
trance

  the guard saluted hesitantly

  i thought you had gone for the dy
herr faber he said

  did you now michael said
that proves that the best of us can be
wrong doesnt it will you open up
please

  but herr faber the guard pro-
tested i have received very strict or-
ders to leave no one in the building
after hours unless accompanied by the
herr minister

  my dear fellow michael said the
bbc is at this moment broadcasting
information which is vital to our armies
are you going to stand in the way of
the third reichs securing that infor-
mation

  but no-

  then kindly open the door you
are a good fellow henry but you must
be careful about thinking too much
the fuehrer you know doesnt like peo-
ple who think thank you

  michael paused in the doorway

  by the way henry who gave you
the orders not to leave anyone into the
broadcasting offices after hours

  captain mueller sir he brought an
order signed by marshal von bock

  i see excellent men both good
night

  michael strode briskly through the
darkened corridors of the building un-
til he came to a small office on the first
floor he opened the door snapped on
a light and entered

  the small room was completely fitted
as a sending and receiving radio station
michael tossed his hat on his desk and
sat down frowning

  it was two oclock in the morning
the previous afternoon he had wit-
nessed the destruction of lidice now
in a few minutes he would receive a

code message intermingled with a regu-
lar bbc broadcast giving him his
next instructions

  the order of von bock delivered by
captain mueller bothered him he
could easily enough arrange to have the
bbc messages sent in at another
time but the order might be an indica-
tion that he was no longer trusted
there had been definite suspicion in
captain muellers eyes and voice the
previous day and if he had communi-
cated his suspicions to von bock there
might be trouble and that was put-
ting it mildly

  michael stood up and closed the door
then he switched on the powerful re-
ceiving set and adjusted the delicate
instruments in a moment the voice
of the english announcer flooded
through the room it was a standard
broadcast to the peoples of europe tell-
ing the truth of what was happening
on the major battle fronts and michael
knew that hundreds of forbidden radio
sets were transmitting those truths to
thousands of tense hopeful men and
women on the continent of europe

jlje glanced at his watch when
the hands stood exactly at 
he leaned forward and began scribbling
furiously on a pad on the desk he
took the message down in english a
risky procedure but knew he might not
have time to code and decode it later
the only key to the code used by the
bbc was in michaels head and this
single fact had been responsible large-
ly for his success

  he covered several sheets with his
fast scrawl at  the code message
stopped abruptly michael turned down
the volume of the receiver and then
carefully studied the message he had
received from london intelligence

  hunched over his desk he was so
absorbed in his task that he didnt hear


fantastic adventures

the slight creak as the door behind him
slowly opened but he felt the light
draft on the back of his neck and his
muscles tensed one hand closed slowly
over the scrawled sheets of paper hed
been reading the scrawled sheet that
bore the message from london intel-
ligence

  late hours youre keeping herr
faber a cool clear voice said behind
him

  michael turned slowly in his chair
his face and eyes expressionless

  marie kahn stood in the doorway a
queer smile on her lips she was wear-
ing a crimson evening gown and ted
sandals her flaming hair fell to her
bare white shoulders framing the ex-
quisite perfection of her classically
molded features

  there was no expression on her mar-
ble-white face and her cool gray eyes
studied michael with an impassive in-
scrutable regard

  your devotion to your work is very
commendable she said quietly her
glance moved to the paper in michaels
hand that must be a very important
communication herr faber yowiold
it as though your life depended on it
may i see it or is it confidental

  its nothing important michael
said just a dull summarjorthe last
bbc report nothing that would in-
terest a beautiful girl in a new evening
gown at least but you shouldnt be
thinking of tiresome details on a night
like this dressed as you are your
thoughts should be of moonlight and
music and the lucky young man who
should be holding you in his arms
dont you agree fraulein

  a pretty speech the girl mur-
mured something i hardly expected
to hear from you one good surprise
deserves another herr faber she
paused and said softly the time is
near at hand

  michael remained perfectly still not
a muscle moved in his lean face but
his brain was racing feverishly

  she had said the time is near at
hand

  and that phrase was the pass word
of the underground fighters in nazi-
dominated europe

  the words seemed to linger in the
room beating against his ears the girl
was studying him impassively but
there was a faint smile curving her lips

  i dont understand michael said
did you say that the time was near
at hand

  yes

  im sorry if i seem stupid michael
said smiling but i dont follow you
the time is near at hand for what
im not sure the girl said her
eyes droppedagain to the papers in his
hand perhaps that information is on
those sheets of paper in your hand

m i c h a e l stood up suddenly
crossed the room and closed the
door he took the girl by the shoulders
and stared deep into her gray eyes

  i cant believe it he said softly
id have sworn you were with those
devils heart and soul my congratula-
tions you are an excellent actress but
how did you know me

  one of our men in berlin told me to
see you the girl said your position
is becoming very dangerous several
officials have become suspicious of your
work there is the possibility of an
investigation

  i have been expecting that
michael said but i still have a few
weeks and thats all the time i need
no the girl said quickly the sit-
uation is more serious than that that
is why i came tonight to warn you
michael noticed that the girls cheeks
were tinted with warm color and there
was fire and spirit in her deep gray eyes
the ghost that haunted hitler



she was a woman alive and glowing
and the mantle of glacial hardness had
fallen from her revealing a vital beauty
that was thrilling in its perfection

  i have been with captain mueller
tonight she said i left him a few
moments ago at a cafe he is bitterly
suspicious of you and he has talked to
von bock i think he has half con-
vinced him that you should be jailed
until an investigation is made he told
me that much tonight i slipped away
from him to warn you

  michaels face hardened

  i cant let anything stop me now
he said ive just received an order
from london intelligence probably
the most important assignment ive
ever gotten i cant fail i have to go
to berlin immediately

  but how marie demanded it is
suicide now

  not quite michael said grimly
his yellow eyes were savagely gleam-
ing i have had arrangements made
for a plane for several days ive been
expecting this job youve got to throw
mueller off my trail for a few hours at
least that will give me time to clear
out of here can you do it

  i dont know the girl said i will
try

  good it will take me only a few
moments to destroy everything of im-
portance here then ill leave for the
air-port where did you say you left
captain mueller

  the girl was opening her mouth to
answer when the door behind her
opened suddenly

  i hope im not intruding a harsh
guttural voice said

  the owner of the voice was captain
mueller he stood in the doorway
filling it with his solid bulk his hard
chiseled face was alight with sadistic
amusement he looked from michael
to the girl and his pale eyes were sus-

piciously narrowed

  you both seem nervous he said
slowly what is there to be nervous
about

he girl stepped suddenly away
from michael and placed herself be-
side the captain

  your suspicions were correct cap-
tain mueller she said coldly let me
congratulate you her eyes were ex-
pressionlessly cold as she regarded
michael this american is a spy he
has admitted it to me he has just
received a code message from the brit-
ish broadcast the message is in his
hand right now

  so captain mueller said softly
i was right his eyes met michaels
in mocking triumph american swine
he said harshly you will pay fot this
treachery with your life his hjigd
closed over the butt of the luger
strapped to his side

  michael said nothing and his lean
face was bleak and hard the girl met
his smouldering gaze defiantly

  it would be pleasant to meet you
again he said quietly	

  fraulein kahn captain mueller
said suddenly why did you come
here to this american	

  it was my duty as a member of the
reich the girl said coldly you said
that you were suspicious of him and i
felt i could trick him into betraying
himself more easily than you

  captain mueller grinned softly

  you are very clever fraulein i
will see that your superior officer hears
of your good work his grin broad-
ened i can admit now that at one
time i was suspicious even of you

  such caution is commendable the
girl said quietly it is impossible to be
too careful in these matters

  we think alike fraulein obtain
mueller said
	fantastic adventures

  he drew the luger from his holster
and stepped past the girl toward
michael

  you will come with me he said to
the american any attempt to escape
will be very unwise i would enjoy
shooting you in the stomach herr
faber

  why not the back michael said
ironically his thin face was sardoni-
cally impassive but the muscles of his
body were coiled like tight springs
ready to strike at the slightest oppor-
tunity the back is the favorite nazi
target you know

  dog captain mueller snapped
i should break your stupid face for
such an insult to our reich

  flushed with anger he stepped for-
ward and michael saw from the corner
of his eye the girl behind him reach out
swiftly and pick up a heavy ash tray
hope flickered in his eyes

  captain mueller caught the look and
his face hardened suspiciously

  what- he broke off and wheeled
as suddenly as a cat

  the girl was raising the ash tray over
her head ready to swing down with all
her strength

  so he snarled you are in with
him did you think you could fool
me

  he swung the gun around to cover
the girl his face was brutal and dark
there was blood-lust in his small pig-
gish eyes

  for the first time his eyes were off
michael

  and michael lunged forward driving
his hard shoulder with all his wiry
strength into the back of the german
officers knees the savage sudden-
ness of the attack hurled the captains
heavy body to the floor in a tangled
sprawl michaels fist closed on the
germans gun wrist with vise-like pres-
sure as they rolled on the floor locked

fiercely together

  the gun fell from captain muellers
hand but before michael could press
his advantage the german with a sav-
age twist hurled him loose and stag-
gered to his feet he groped for the
gun but michael lashed out with his
foot catching him in the shoulder and
knocking him back against the wall of
the office

  the girl kicked the gun out of reach
as captain mueller lunged forward
again enraged he struck her with the
back of his heavy hand across the face
a livid mark stained the whiteness of
her face and she fell against the desk
her hands pressed to the angry red
mark

atichael rose cat-like to his feet

      his narrow face was tense and
the centers of his yellow eyes were
smoky pools of savage rage

  you are effective against women
captain he said softly an inartic-
ulate growl sounded deep in the ger-
man officers throat as he charged for-
ward his fists swinging like mallets

  michael side-stepped and snapped a
hard left into his face captain muel-
lers head jerked back and blood
trickled from his mouth

  dog he roared

  he lowered his bullet-shaped head
and rushed michael backing him
toward a corner michaels left hand
flicked out again and again like the
darting tongue of a snake blinding the
charging german but captain muel-
lers superior weight and strength drove
the american relentlessly back until he
was trapped in a corner of the room

  ducking a round-house right swing
michael stepped in close and drove a
hard chopping right into the ger-
mans jowls the punch packed be-
hind it all of his wiry power and he felt
its shock all the way to his elbow
the ghost that haunted hitler



  the captain staggered back cursing
madly through his blood-frothed lips
michael stepped in again recklessly
he knew he had to finish this quickly
or the guards would be drawn to the
scene by the noise

  he swung again but mueller blocked
the blow and countered with a vicious
right michaels guard was down and
the blow landed solidly on his jaw
slamming him back against the wall
his head snapped back crashing into
the wall and a million streaking lights
exploded in his brain

  his knees sagged his head slumped
down on his chest through a red
fog of pain he could dimly see captain
muellers stocky figure standing in
front of him gloatingly expectant

  he tried to lift his arms but he
lacked the strength his breath was
a rasping pain in his throat he knew
he was through that this was the end

  captain mueller turned suddenly
and crossed the room with rapid
strides he bent and picked up the
gun from the floor and turned back to
michael the ugly blue hole in the luger
barrel centered unwaveringly on his
stomach

  you have lost herr faber cap-
tain mueller said his breath coming
heavily there will be no trial and
execution for you i will provide
both

  michael lifted his head slowly he
saw the bestial triumph in muellers
eyes and he saw the twitching muscles
of the hand that held the luger and he
knew that he was facing death

  suddenly an english voice roared in
the room

  mueller started and swung half way
around the red-haired girl michael
saw had flicked on the powerful re-
ceiving set the voice in the room was
that of the bbc announcer but the
ruse had diverted for an instant

the germans attention had given
michael one thousand-to-one chance
and he took that chance

fathering his fading strength
he hurled himself across the room
at the germans surprised figure
mueller wheeled whipping the gun
about to cover michael but he was
too late michael drove into his gun
arm doubling the wrist inward and as
the two men crashed to the floor a
muffled explosion sounded

  the girl screamed as a hoarse
strained gasp followed the sound of the
shot she dropped to her knees and
pulled michael from the germans
body there was blood on his shirt
front but it was from the oozing stain
that was spreading slowly over captain
muellers chest

  her lips moved in a silent prayer
thank god she murmured she
pulled michaels head close to her and
he opened his eyes and smiled faintly

  pleasant as this is he said well
have to postpone it for a while

  he stood up and turned down the
radio

  that was a neat trick he said
looking down at her it undoubtedly
saved my life which isnt so important
but the work i have to do is important
thank you for that

  he helped her to her feet

  you fooled me again when he came
in he said i thought surely id mis-
judged you i believed you when you
said youd come here to trick me into
revealing myself as a british agent

  it was the only thing i could do
the girl answered we are lucky he
was stupid enough to believe me now
we must plan to get you out of here
do you think the guard could have
heard the shot

  it isnt likely michael said the
radio was on full blast and the sound


fantastic adventures

of the shot was muffled our luck is
still holding

  he unfolded the paper of instruc-
tions he still held in his hand and
studied it intently a faint frown form-
ing on his lean face

  this is urgent he said every
second now is precious get ready to
leave ill dispose of the body in a less
conspicuous spot it wont be discov-
ered until tomorrow morning and by
that time our work will be done
michael opened the door and glanced
up and down the corridor seeing that
the way was clear he bent and hoisted
the heavy body of the dead german
officer to his shoulder and stepped into
the corridor lurching under his awk-
ward burden he moved silently down
the hallway until he reached an inter-
secting corridor he followed this for
several yards until he came to a small
closet opening the door he dumped
the germans body on the floor and cov-
ered it with a tarpaulin he found hang-
ing on the wall

  then he closed and locked the door
as he started back a sudden chilling
scream shattered the stillness michael
froze in the darkness of the hall his
heart pounding a thousand specula-
tions seemed to crowd his brain

  the scream sounded again a help-
less terror-filled cry of anguish that
chilled the marrow in his bones he
hesitated for another second his mind
working with lightning-speed then he
broke into a charging run

chapter v

     michael raced toward the
sound of the scream he realized
with sudden helplessness that he was
completely unarmed he had left the
germans luger lying on the floor of
the radio room

  he charged recklessly around the

corner of the corridor but the sight
that met his eyes brought him to a sud-
den incredulous halt

  marie was standing in front of the
open door of the radio room her body
stiffened in a posture of terror and a
white mask of dread stamped on her
lovely features

  but there was no one else in sight
there was nothing to account for her
expression of terror she was com-
pletely alone in the dimly lighted cor-
ridor

  as michael started toward her his
eyes followed the gaze of her wide
horror-filled eyes and he suddenly saw
what had attracted her frightened fas-
cinated stare

  in the gloom of the corridor not a
foot from her face a heavy black gun
was visible menacing her with its grim
blue-holed muzzle

  the gun was suspended in the air
five feet from the floor a chilling un-
natural spectacle that apparently defied
the laws of gravity

  then michael saw the shadowy hand
that held the gun and against the un-
certain gloom of the hall he made out a
vague spectral shape crouched before
the girls terrified figure

  a flood of relief washed over him

  paul he cried he broke into 
run dont shoot its all right

  he saw the shadowy suggestion of
a head turn toward him then the gun
lowered slowly the girl leaned weakly
against the wall there was pathetic
relief in her eyes as she saw michael
but a wordless horror still lingered on
her white features

  michael she gasped what is
it am i losing my mind

  michael put his arm about her slim
bare shoulders and drew her close to
him she laid her head against his
breast sobbing

  theres nothing to fear he mur-
the ghost that haunted hitler



mured this is paul cheval the man
who eliminated heydrich

 but-

  i know you cant see him but
neither can the gestapo which is quite
an advantage

a faint humming sounded grew
louder finally fading away to an
indistinct murmur gradually the
shadowy shape of paul cheval mate-
rialized he stood before them the
gun still held in a hand at his side his
dark face grimly anxious the invisi-
bility head-piece was still strapped to
his forehead

  michael introduced him to the girl
and rapidly explained to her how he
had come into possession of the head-
piece at the destruction of lidice

  paul glanced nervously down the
darkened corridors

  there is not much time for talk
he said the storm troopers of cap-
tain mueller are outside waiting for a
signal from him to enter they will not
wait much longer

  i am leaving for berlin immedi-
ately michael said youve got to
hold the troopers for a few minutes
paul while marie and i slip out the
back door i have just received in-
formation from london that the second
front will soon be opened on the con-
tinent my orders are to contact every
underground worker i possibly can with
this news weve got to strike at the
nazis with everything weve got ru-
mors assassinations sabotage-all of
these must be increased a hundredfold
weve got to give the storm troopers
and gestapo so much to do inside eu-
rope that theyll take their eyes off the
outside our job is to turn the conti-
nent of europe into a cauldron of boil-
ing trouble for the nazis heydrichs
death is only the start from now on
nothing must stop us

  paul nodded nothing shall stop
us the people of this region are ready
for open revolt already fifteen hun-
dred innocent hostages have been killed
for the assassination of heydrich and
more will be killed every day the
people have reached the breaking
point

  good michael snapped the
nazis are choking themselves to death
with their own blood lust he reached
out suddenly and gripped pauls shoul-
der when i finish my assignment in
berlin i am going back to london
those are my orders a camouflaged
raf plane will pick me up when my
work is done but the fight here must
go on you must not falter paul the
second front is coming but the domi-
nated peoples inside europe must pre-
pare for it as carefully as our allies
outside europe

  he broke off suddenly through the
dark building came the echoing tread
of swiftly striding booted feet

  the storm troopers of captain
mueller marie cried

  we must go michael said softly
this is goodbye paul hold them for
a few seconds at least that will give
us a start

  pauls hand flicked up to the dial on
his head-piece the humming noise
sounded and then his body faded
slowly almost imperceptibly into the
dark gloom of the corridor his eyes
were visible for a last instant cold and
gleaming in the blackness

  i will hold them he whispered
now go his formless invisible
hand touched michaels arm for an in-
stant until we meet again then
he faded away toward the sound of
advancing troopers

  michael took maries hand and ted
her swiftly through the blackened cor-
ridors toward a rear door which he
knew would be unguarded


fantastic adventures

  a shot suddenly echoed through the
building followed by hoarse confused
shouts another shot rang out and
the sound of booted feet scrambling for
cover could be heard

  michaels hand gripped maries
tightly as they slipped from the build-
ing into the narrow alley-way that
flanked it his thin face was set in
hard lines his yellow-green eyes flashed
in the darkness

  the sound of another shot was
heard three more followed in quick
succession

  michael marie whispered tensely
has paul a chance of escaping
perhaps he said but if he
doesnt hell send a number of nazis
to hell before they get him come we
have to hurry

chapter vi

rthe sleek light bomber settled grace-
fully to a sprawling landing field on
the outskirts of berlin the pilot cut
the throbbing roar of the engines as the
plane taxied to a stop facing the ad-
ministration buildings of the field

  an attendant ran to the plane and
adjusted a portable stairway to the
gleaming side of the ship then he
swung open the door

  thank you michael faber said
smiling i see that you received my
radio message is the car waiting
yes herr faber the attendant
said everything is in readiness do
you wish to leave immediately

  yes speed is essential

  i will take you to your car
michael strode down the sloping
walk to the field marie kahn followed
him walking carefully on her high-
heeled evening shoes she wore
michaels suit coat over her bare shoul-
ders

  michael held her hand tightly as they

hurried across the field to where a low-
slung powerful car awaited them

  our luck is still holding he whis-
pered obviously muellers body
hasnt been discovered yet

  the slanting rays of false dawn were
coloring the blackness of the eastern
horizon and despite the season there
was a noticeable chill in the air

  the landing-field attendant opened
the door of the waiting car with a flour-
ish and stepped aside

  you will be at your destination in
twenty minutes herr faber he said
he smiled brightly i trust i have
handled everything to your satisfaction
herr faber

  absolutely michael said and
i shall see that word of your good work
is passed on to your superiors

  oh thank you herr faber
michael helped marie into the car
and stepped in after her

  central intelligence he said to the
driver a stocky blonde man wearing
a corporals uniform and hurry

  the driver nodded without turning
the gears of the car meshed smoothly
and it shot away from the field rapidly
gathering speed

  michael looked down at the red-
haired girl at his side and he smiled
softly

  so far so good he murmured

  we have been lucky the girl said
let us pray our luck holds

  it must hold michael said grimly
nothing more was said until they
reached the blacked-out unter den
linden and turned off on a deserted
side street that led to the central in-
telligence offices

  do you know any of the staff at
central michael asked quietly

 no why

  it might have helped if you did
the problem of getting in at this hour
of the morning might be difficult but
the ghost that haunted hitler



well manage

  the office is in charge of marshal
von umbreit the girl said but i know
nothing of him

rjphe car rolled to a smooth stop a
few moments later in front of a
modern white-fronted building the
building was completely dark and sand-
bags were piled high against the walls

  the driver got out and opened the
door

  will that be all sir he asked

  michael noticed that a half dozen
guards were on patrol in front of the
building and that two of them had
halted and were watching the car

  yes michael said that will be
all

  he stepped out into the dark street
and gave his hand to marie when she
stood beside him on the sidewalk the
driver saluted jerkily got back into the
car and drove off

  michael took the girls arm

  follow my lead he whispered in
a louder voice he said come frau-
lein there is not a minute to lose

  the words carried clearly in the dead
silence of the night

  michael saw the two guards moving
slowly toward them their booted feet
sounding ominously on the hard side-
walk but he pretended to be unaware
of their presence

  with his hand on maries arm he
strode briskly toward the main entrance
of the central intelligence building
the booted feet broke into a run and
a guttural voice cried halt

  with his foot on the first step leading
up to the buildings main door michael
paused he turned as the two guards
approached at a lumbering run rifles
held in readiness

  ah there you are he said just
the men i wanted to see where the
devil were you hiding yourselves

napping on post i dare say he
turned to marie make a note of that
fraulein its time steps were taken
about such carelessness

   the two guards came to a stop their
mouths dropping in amazement the
larger of the two a florid-faced cold-
eyed example of the prussian type
stuttered speechlessly

  what is the meaning of this he
finally managed to bellow who are
you what do you want here at this
time of night where are your pa-
pers

   you want a lot of information dont
you michael murmured has it
ever occurred to you that the british
too want precisely that same type of
information no of course it hasnt
my good fellow we are here to see
marshal von umbreit if you can take
us to him please do so if not find
us someone capable of performing that
task we have no time to waste

rjphe guards beefy face reddened

     marshal von umbreit he
fumed will not be here for another
five hours i demand to see your pa-
pers

  michael studied the man with cold
deliberate eyes

  would you be good enough he
said to tell me when you had your
last discussion with the marshal about
his plans for this morning

  i have had no discussion with the
marshal the guard said flustered but
it is his custom-

  bah michael said in disgust
how can we win a war handicapped by
clods like you he whipped out his
wallet and held his identification under
the guards nose i am a special agent
from marshal von bock tell me
have you heard of marshal von bock
but of course the guard mum-
bled i-


fantastic adventures

  this is fraulein marie kahn mi-
chael snapped from the office of hein-
rich himmler have you heard of
him

 yes-

  we are here to see marshal von
umbreit in regard to the assassination
of upper group leader heydrich is
that name familiar to you herr dump-
koff

  certainly the guard cried his voice
breaking slightly i-

  youre progressing michael said
gently now he said his voice har-
dening will you take us to marshal
von umbreits office or shall i call
himmler

  this is against my instructions
the guard moaned if anything hap-
pens-

  michael turned to the red-haired
girl

  what is himmlers private num-
ber he asked

  no the guard almost shrieked
do not call him it will not be neces-
sary i-i will take you to the mar-
shals office come with me

  michaels hand closed tightly over
the girls as they followed the guard up
the steps of the building to the main
entrance

  the guard swung wide the heavy
brass doors and preceded them into the
darkened interior of the building he
drew a torch from his pocket and shot
a beam of light down a wide heavily
carpeted hallway

  because of the blackout he said
we can have no lights

  oh is that why michael said i
thought for a minute you were just be-
ing economical

  oh no the guard chuckled it is
the blackout orders it is silly but it
is an order

  silly michael said you dont
think the raf will come this way

  of course not the guard said he
led them down the wide corridor past
imposingly lettered doors toward a
heavy double door at the end of the
hall

  you seem confident about not being
bombed michael said but how about
cologne they tell me there was a
raid over that city

  british lies the guard scoffed
the german radio said no damage was
done one report said that only a few
cows were hit by bombs

  thats right michael said but
those cows burned for five days
thats right the guard smiled
they burned for five-

ilte stopped smiling and looked
sharply at michael he scratched
his head slowly and a peculiar look of
bewilderment spread over his blunt fea-
tures

  five days he mumbled thats
a long time for cows to burn no

  an ordinary cow might not burn
that long michael said but natu-
rally the superior breed of german
cow would be a different matter

  they stopped in front of the double
doors at the end of the corridor and the
guard stepped aside

  this is marshal von umbreits of-
fice you can wait for him here will
you need my light

  possibly michael said id bet-
ter take it just in case thank you
very much i shall see that your su-
periors hear of your good work

  the guards face beamed

  thank you herr faber

  he started away and then turned
back his forehead wrinkled in per-
plexity

  i do not mean to be disloyal he
said but five days is still a long time
for cows to burn with an embar-
rassed frown he wheeled and marched
the ghost that haunted hitler



back down the corridor

  michael watched until he opened the
buildings brass doors and disappeared
into the street before drawing marie
into marshal von umbreits office and
closing and locking the door

  marie leaned weakly against the wall
and laughed hysterically

  michael took her by the shoulders
and shook her roughly

  stop it he said tensely the big
job is still ahead of us get hold of
yourself

  im sorry marie said pressing her
hands to her face im all right now
but sometimes i have the feeling that
something inside of me is ready to snap
ive had that feeling many times in the
last two years

  i know michael said softly he
lifted her chin with his finger and
smiled into her deep gray eyes ive
felt that myself its not pleasant
but then neither is the thing were
fighting against pleasant

  im ashamed of myself the girl
said

  you havent any reason for being
michael said quietly youve been
magnificent but you cant fold now
we still have a job ahead of us

  he flashed the torch about the large
luxuriously appointed office under the
inevitable swastika there was a huge
mahogany desk in immaculate order

  michael crossed to the desk and
studied the drawers for an instant

  it wouldnt be in a drawer he
muttered nevertheless he tried the
drawers but all were locked

  you havent told me what youre
looking for marie said

  im after a roll of film michael an-
swered our intelligence learned that
the germans had photographed the
camouflaging that has been done on the
french coast these films are in mi-
croscopic scale with special repro-

duction apparatus they can be blown
up into eight by ten photographs it
is extremely vital that these films reach
british hands the entire plan for the
second front depends on discovering
what areas are camouflaged aerial
photography isnt completely satisfac-
tory so the only alternative is to bor-
row the actual small scale german
films and thats just what were going
to do

  have you any idea where they are
  roughly theyre in this office

iite played his torch over the walls
and ceiling and then inspected the
desk again

  hardly in the desk too easy to
steal he frowned but thered be
no point in hiding them the logical
place would be an easily accessible re-
pository that would be burglar proof
a wall safe marie suggested
probably michael nodded

  marie turned suddenly and swept
back the swastika from the wall

  this is what you want then this
is a favorite place of concealment in
german offices

  michael saw a small steel wall safe
set in the bared wall he stepped
quickly to it and slowly turned the dial
with his long sensitive fingers

  i have the combination he mur-
mured it was obligingly furnished
by one of our workers here

  for several seconds he spun the tiny
gleaming dial then he pulled suddenly
and the door swung noiselessly open
he pointed the flash into the small dark
interior and saw several sheafs of paper
and at the far end of the safe the ob-
ject for which he was searching a
tiny roll of films

  weve done it he said excitedly
he removed the films checked them
carefully but hastily then shoved them
into his trouser pocket his lean face


fantastic adventures

was gleaming with triumph

  by dawn well be flying for lon-
don he cried weve got to leave
immediately every second is working
against us

  he turned back to close the wall safe
when he had closed it and drawn the
swastika back into place he wheeled to
the girl

  every step takes us nearer eng-
land he said tensely we mustnt
falter

  we wont marie said

  michael took her arm and started
across the floor suddenly lights
flashed on in the room from overhead
and wall sockets bright bulbs blazed
into brilliance

  michaels body froze in a crouch he
jerked marie to a stop

  somethings wrong he whispered
well have to find another way out

  hardly had the words passed his lips
when the great double door of the office
swung inward and the short pigeon-
puffy form of marshal von bock
stepped into the room

  two storm troopers followed him
lugers drawn

  von bocks thick lips were curved in
a sadistic smile but his eyes were
angry and cold

  how fortunate we discovered your
little game herr faber he said in his
soft lisping voice

chapter vii

cor an instant there was complete
silence in the room the tension
grew until michael gradually relaxed
and allowed a slow ironic smile to light
his pale thin features

  what a suspicious nature you have
marshal he remarked mildly please
tell those determined men with you to
put their guns away before they shoot
someone accidentally

  they will not shoot anyone by ac-
cident von bock said significantly
your clever tongue will not save you
this time herr faber you have
reached the end of your very long rope
i have just seen the body of captain
mueller

  gracious michael murmured is
he dead what happened to the poor
chap

  stop stalling von bock snapped
you killed him i know that and it
will be our pleasure to execute you as
a british agent or is it america
youre working for herr faber

  michael shrugged thats a tech-
nicality isnt it what difference does
it make

  von bock nodded to the two storm
troopers

  search him

  the two men went over michael
carefully they handed the roll of film
to von bock along with his personal ef-
fects

  i think i know what this is von
bock said studying the film yes it
is very fortunate we stopped you be-
fore you left europe herr faber
he turned his round head slightly and
studied the red-haired girl your
presence here fraulein kahn i find
rather puzzling perhaps you can clear
the doubts that are plucking at my
mind

  there is nothing puzzling about my
presence here marshal von bock the
girl answered coldly captain mueller
and i were working together to trap the
american unfortunately we under-
estimated our opponent he shot cap-
tain mueller with his own gun and
forced me to accompany him here be-
cause i knew the layout of the building
i imagine he intended to kill me later

  what a harrowing experience for
you fraulein  von bock said mildly

  michael risked a quick glance at the
the ghost that haunted hitler



mavshal but it was impossible to tell
from the mans expressionless moon-
like face what he was thinking

  he paced slowly back and forth tug-
ging at his fat under lip

  i must make a report of this mat-
ter personally he said thoughtfully
marshal von umbreit must be notified
immediately he turned again to
marie i shall leave the american in
your hands i shall leave these two
men with you however for he might
become troublesome he nodded to
one of the storm troopers tie his
arms behind him and watch him care-
fully he is very clever

  with a cynical wave of his hand to
michael he stepped from the room
closing the door after him

  you have your orders marie
snapped to the troopers bind his
arms

the nazi soldiers knotted a belt
about his wrists michael nodded
slowly to the girl she turned away and
removed his coat from her shoulders
tossed it over a chair

  do either of you have a cigarette
she asked of the storm troopers

  michael smiled faintly the girl was
acting her part admirably this was
obviously a trap by von bock to see if
she had been telling the truth prob-
ably the marshal was waiting outside
the door with a dozen men if she made
the slightest move to help him it would
cost both their lives

  one of the soldiers offered her a cig-
arette and held a match until the tip
was glowing brightly she blew a cloud
of blue smoke into the air and faced
michael a cool smile curving her lips
but there was an anguish in her gray
eyes that she could not conceal

  so she said softly you thought
you could fool the gestapo indefi-
nitely

  michael shrugged

  we all make mistakes i made one
in forcing you to accompany me had
i gone on alone i would probably have
been successful

  michael hoped that von bock heard
that much

  i- the girl started to speak but
she stopped suddenly a tense startled
expression spread over her white fea-
tures

  the storm troopers noticed the sud-
den change

  what is it one of them demanded
he raised his gun and glanced about
the room with suspicious eyes

  michael raised his head slightly a
fierce exultant hope was pounding
through his veins

  for he could hear distinctly a faint
humming sound in the large office and
from the corner of his eye he saw a
shadowy shape moving toward the girl
she obviously had heard the sound and
had recognized it as did michael

  paul cheval the one man to survive
the horror of lidice was in the room a
grim phantom of vengeance and retri-
bution

  this was one development that von
bock hadnt planned when he had set
this little trap

   it is nothing the girl said quickly

i-ive been through so much in the
last few hours that my nerves are
jumpy i thought i saw the figure of a
man on the other side of the room

toth troopers turned in the direc-
tion she indicated and at that same
instant the stocky black-browed figure
of paul cheval materialized beside
the girl with a swift rush he lunged jp
at one of the soldiers ripped the luger
from his hand he shoved the man
away from him and swung the gun to
cover the second trooper

  drop your gun  he said his voice


fantastic adventures

was like thin ice cracking there was
no mistaking the chilling intention in
his hot black eyes

  the soldier dropped his gun to the
floor with trembling fingers

  marie stepped quickly to michaels
side and went to work on the belt that
was strapped about his wrists

  hurry  paul cheval snapped he
swung one nazi about and brought the
barrel of his gun down across the mans
temple he sagged to the floor like a
damp sack of oats the other trooper
opened his mouth to cry out but paul
rammed his gun butt-deep into the
mans stomach

  one squeak and you die he whis-
pered

  the nazis eyes circled in terror
whites gleaming but his mouth clamped
suddenly shut

  michael felt his bonds giving but
before he could slip his wrists free the
door of the office burst open and von
bock strode into the room he was
alone but he held an unwavering luger
in his hand

  he saw paul and his face went blank
with amazement

  paul jerked his gun up but von bock
fired first the bullet slammed into
paul knocking him about in a half-
circle he fell slowly to the floor his
face a mask of agony blood stained
his shirt and his face was an ashen
gray desperately he tried to raise the
gun in his hand but it slipped from his
nerveless fingers as he slumped to the
floor

  von bock swung around to cover
marie

  so he snapped harshly you
were in with him

  he strode across the room on his
thick stubby legs flushed with anger

  i caught you attempting to free
him he said for that you will die
with him fraulein

  without taking his eyes from the
girl he signaled to the trooper who
was still on his feet

  drag the swine i shot from the
room i dont like the smell of fresh
blood

  the trooper put his hands under
pauls shoulders and dragged him
across the floor and out of the room
slamming the door after him

  now von bock said harshly we
will see fraulein if your tricks will
work on me we have been alto-
gether too lenient in dealing with ene-
mies of the reich from now on we
shall be more firm

  he shifted his gun to his left hand as
he spoke then he stepped forward
and slapped the girl savagely across
the cheek

  that fraulein is only the start

  you inhuman beast the girl cried

tvtichael said nothing but his face
was set and pale he was work-
ing desperately at his bonds the girl
had loosened them but not enough to
free his wrists if only he had time   

  von bock sauntered slowly over to
him his thick lips were smiling
grimly

  you have made quite a fool of me
herr faber he said my superiors
are going to wonder how you were able
to deceive me for over two years it
is possible that i may be demoted be-
cause of you you were very clever
many times you must have been laugh-
ing at me herr faber

  his face clouded suddenly with bitter
rage and the veins at his temples
throbbed visibly

  didnt you laugh herr faber he
shouted his voice hoarse and ragged

  michael smiled and shook his head

  i never laughed at you herr mar-
shal he said but many times i
pitied you
the ghost that haunted hitler



  pityl von bocks voice shook
with insane rage

  he drove his right fist suddenly into
michaels face the unexpectedness
rather than the force of the blow stag-
gered him and he slumped to his knees
blood streamed from his lip

  but as he fell he strained desperately
at the belt about his wrists and he felt
it give slightly on his knees before
von bock he slipped one hand free as
his other hand came loose he dropped
his head to his chest to hide the elated
expression on his face

  that is a fitting posture for you
von bock snarled on your knees
head bowed before the herrenvolk

  he raised his booted foot but as he
kicked at michaels face michael
shifted slightly and von bocks leg shot
across his shoulder michael ducked
swiftly and his hands shot out grab-
bing the marshals other leg

  a savage jerk brought the germans
portly figure crashing to the floor mi-
chael lunged for von bocks gun hand
but the luger had dropped to the floor
in the fall the marshal squirmed on
top of michael and dug his thumbs into
his eyes

  you dog he cried ill tear your
eyes-

  a shot sounded and the marshals
voice faded into a cracked choking
bleat he rolled off michaels body
and his short legs pumped wildly spas-
modically for an instant and then they
were still

  michael climbed weakly to his feet

  marie held the marshals luger and
a wisp of smoke was trailing from the
muzzle of the gun she brushed a
lock of hair from her white forehead
and leaned limply against the desk

  i shot him in the back she said
dully

  michael took her shoulders and
shook her gently

  forget that he said quietly
never think of it it was simply
something you had to do now pull
yourself together weve got a million-
to-one chance to get out of here but we
cant waste a second

  he dropped to his knees beside von
bocks body and transferred the vital
roll of film to his own pocket

  then he led the girl to the door and
opened it cautiously the corridor was
deserted michaels chief worry was
the storm trooper who had carried out
pauls body he should be back on the
scene any minute

  come on he said this is our
only chance

he closed the door and with marie
at his side strode down the long
carpeted corridor to the double brass
doors that led to the street his heart
was hammering in his throat

  opening the door boldly he stepped
out into the cool gray dawn instantly
two guards confronted him one of
them was the florid-faced soldier who
had originally let them in

  michael nodded casually to him and
gave his arm to marie

  glad to see youre on the alert he
said smiling

  the guard made no move to let them
pass

  i heard two shots from inside he
said the marshal instructed me to let
no one into the building after he went
in

  quite right michael said im-
portant things have transpired here to-
night do you realize the heydrich
slayer was here tonight

  no the guard gasped he looked
nervously about

  he is dead now michael said
our courageous marshal dispatched
him himself i am carrying the mes-
sage to himmler


fantastic adventures

  he patted the guard on the shoulder
you have done your work well i
have already mentioned your alertness
to von bock now keep up the good
work let no one in or out until i re-
turn do you understand

  yes but what did the marshal von
bock say about me

  michael smiled at the guard

  you know how he is hes not say-
ing much at all these days

  the guard looked bewildered for a
while but then an uncertain smile
broke over his frown

  yes thats right he doesnt say
much these days

  he is practically silent michael
said

  the guard laughed hugely without
knowing why

  marie said quietly we must hurry
yes michael said we mustnt
keep himmler waiting

  he pointed to a black military car
parked at the curb a half block from
the building

  is that the marshals car

  still smiling the guard nodded
thank you michael said hold-
ing maries arm he descended the short
flight of steps to the sidewalk and
walked toward the marshals parked
car

  steady he whispered gently to the
girl dont walk too fast

  the girls hand tightened in his as
she forced herself to match his casual
stride when they reached the car
michael opened the door and helped
marie into the front seat

  ill drive he said he glanced up
at the light-tinged horizon thought-
fully we are still in time he whis-
pered the plane will wait another
hour

  he stepped around to the other side
of the car and opened the door but as
he was about to slide under the wheel

he happened to glance at the sidewalk
and he saw several fresh drops of blood
gleaming in the early morning light

  the trail of drops led from an alley-
way that flanked the central intelli-
gence building to the middle of the side-
walk and there the trail stopped

  frowning he stared at the drops of
gleaming blood

  suddenly he tensed and a strange
chill shot through his body

  another drop had fallen to the side-
walk-closer than the last

  and a voice whispered michael

tvitichael strained his eyes and he
saw the faint suggestion of a
human shadow standing on the side-
walk and as he watched another
ruby-red drop of blood spattered at his
feet

  paul  he gasped how-

  i am not dead von bocks bullet
went through my shoulder did you
get him

  yes but paul youre hurt

  not too badly i shall live for
awhile yet i have one more job to do
the voice was a weak ghostly whis-
per but there was an undercurrent of
determination in those tones that was as
definite as death itself

  go  paul said already you have
delayed too long

  michael felt a soft hand on his shoul-
der for an instant then it was gone

  until we meet again pauls whis-
per came faintly to him

  paul michael said desperately
where are you going

  the reply came back soft as a sibi-
lant breeze but its implications were as
definite as a roaring storm
berchtesgaden 

  michael heard the faint word and his
lean face softened an ironic smile
curved his lips and he raised his hand
in a gesture that was at once a salute
the ghost that haunted hitler



 and a farewell

  until we meet again paul cheval
 he said

  there was no answer

  michael slid under the wheel and the
 powerful car roared away from the
 curve   

  far above the tragic hate-ruined

continent of europe screened by banks
of drifting clouds a black unmarked
plane streaked northward toward the
isle of britain

  michael faber looked down at the
land far below him and his arm tight-
ened about marie kahns shoulder

the end

gingko petrified forest

washington state boasts a truly ro-
mantic forest for those with imagination
to pierce the past

  gardens of the bygone set with huge trees lost
their tropic verdure in the onrush of lava leaving
only the skeletons of those giant trees imbedded
in crumbling lava rock and soil in the hills near
the columbia river

  some ten to thirty million years ago those
colossal trees were swept along in a columbia
basin lava flow stifling them in its molten mass
ten additional flows of lava laid upon the skele-
ton of that ancient forest have since been eroded
away by wind rain and river action now close
to the surface are marvelous opal logs showing
the exact structure of the wood rings and grain
cast in a medium more beautiful than agate

  the climate in which this far-distant garden
flourished must have been similar to the present
inland empires temperature but damp because
the cascades had not yet been thrown up to
catch the pacific rain-clouds with their spurs as
a result the trees were of a type found now in

the great lakes district of the country plus
many asiatic and semi-tropical varieties

  the gingko for which the forest is named is
an oriental tree a silver apricot growing until
the last century only in the sacred gardens of
china it is now used in this country for or-
namental purposes the only known specimens
of petrified gingko are found in this forest 
miles east of ellensburg on the main highway near
the vantage bridge over the columbia river

  about one hundred logs have been uncovered
here besides the gingko there are three and
four-foot douglas firs maple has been found
three feet through and among the spruce and
three kinds of elm are logs nearly two feet in
diameter others unearthed include bay locust
oak sweet gum birch and blue beach foot
mass solidified into hard red stone is found near
the douglas fir in some cases half a dozen speci-
mens of hardwoods have not been identified with
any present day species or with any known ex-
tinct species

new use for farm wastes

the research division of the department
of agriculture is always on the look-out
for ways to increase the farmers income
one of the latest processes to be discovered is a
new way to remove iron and manganese from
water by means of such farm wastes as corncobs
cornstalks straw and sawdust the process is
covered by patent no  issued to gussie
h nelson max levine and daniel f lynch of
the departments experiment station at ames
iowa

  first of all the specified farm wastes are boiled
in a diluted solution of sulphuric acid the mix-
ture obtained is heated with caustic soda under
steam pressure the solution is then treated with
dilute acid and a precipitate called lignin is

formed

  the lignin produced from corncobs is used in
the purification of water by adding one part lignin
to one million parts of water from which the
iron and manganese are being removed

  the water is then agitated and filtered through
sand and other filters after filtering the in-
ventors claim that lignin-treated water is freer
from iron and manganese moreover the lignin
treatment is so effective that it will remove the
iron even if the water only contains ten parts of
iron to a million parts of water on the other
hand the lignin process can be used to remove
heavy concentrations of iron and mangenese so
that it can be used in the household or in in-
dustries requiring pure water
the japs stormed on until
they faced the legendary
flame of life then all
hell rode the burma road

death dropped down before that grim gateway


by edmond hamilton

john terrell suddenly paused
in his hasty preparations for de-
parture as the distant rattle of
machine-gun fire was punctuated by
two thunderous explosions they shook
the flimsy native hut to its foundations
and set the flickering gasoline lantern
to swinging wildly then the machine-
guns started stuttering again

  he knew what it meant the allied
defenders of lashio were blowing up
the remaining warehouses of munitions
a warning that this vital junction of
the burma road was falling to the
japanese he could hear cries and
crackle of flames and racing motors
out in the night

  where the devil is that crazy bur-
mese terrell muttered as he crammed
things into his pockets if he doesnt
get back soon-

  the tall lank american hastily buck-
led his pistol-belt over his civilian
clothes his lean sober young face was
taut with the sense of crisis as he
grabbed up his pith helmet

  brakes squealed outside and then his
native burmese servant bounded in
the mans thin brown face was glisten-
ing with sweat

  i have the spare cans of gasoline in
the car sahib he reported we leave
now pretty quick the japs are al-
most in town-the last people here are
heading up the road

  were going pronto terrell nod-
ded but were not going up the road
sigri were going to turn off it and
head north

  sigris brown face expressed incre-
dulity north but there is nothing
in the north but wild jungle and moun-
tains and uncivilized tribes

  terrell eyed the burmese intently
isnt the fabled land of yamaya sup-
posed to be somewhere up there beyond

the shian river

  yamaya the burmeses eyes be-
came round as he repeated the name
but yamaya is only a land of legend
but your people believe that legend
dont they terrell persisted they
believe that in that legendary northern
land of yamaya exists the flame of
life

  sigri looked queerly uneasy the
flame of life is only an ancient story
many peoples tell that story

  what is the flame of life supposed
to be the american asked intently
is it a jewel or an idol or what

  i dont know muttered the bur-
mese uncomfortably tradition says
only that it is a thing of supernatural
powers which lies in the lost land of
yamaya it is only a superstition
but that superstition is strong in the
east isnt it terrell demanded if
anyone could secure that flame of life
its possession would give him vast in-
fluence over the eastern peoples
wouldnt it

sigri looked scared terrell sahib


fantastic adventures

you surely are not planning-

  terrell reassured him quickly all
im planning right now is to get away
before the japs catch us and were
going north wed better-

  he was interrupted by a third and
louder explosion the hut shook as
though to an earthquake

  theyre blowing up the last ware-
houses now sigri cried

  out of here then terrell ex-
claimed

  they ran out of the hut into the hot
steamy blackness of the tropic night
the battered topless car whose spare
cans sigri had filled with gasoline was
waiting outside the door but for a
moment terrell was spellbound by the
unearthly spectacle of lashio tonight

hthe war-gods were trampling here

   red flames were spouting from
scores of the flimsy buildings casting a
lurid glare high in the heavens shells
were slamming monotonously into the
huddle of burning streets and the whin-
ing roar of diving jap planes was se-
queled by the crash of bursting bombs
burning wreckage flew skyward a block
from where they stood

  lashio was falling-but not without
savage resistance even in this final hour
of its doom down at the southern
edge of town a few s were still
booming and the constant crackle of
machine-guns told of the outnumbered
chinese british and americans who
were determinedly taking toll of the
advancing hordes of nippon

  thats only a rear-guard left to
cover the main retreat up the road
terrell said tensely they cant hold
for long

  his fists were clenched his lank fig-
ure taut with fierce desire to go down
there and join those fighting men in
their last stand but terrell con-
quered that tugging emotion

  our job is to get away to the north
he said harshly come on

  sigri leaped behind the wheel of the
car and gunned its motor terrell
jumped in beside him the car sped
up a street of flaming shacks twisting
to avoid shell-craters and fallen debris

  shadowy shapes of looters skulked in
the burning town but most of its in-
habitants were already miles away
streaming up the road toward china
smashed trucks and empty shell-cases
littered the way

  they were at the north edge of town
where the road wound out into the
hills when a figure leaped out into their
headlights

  hold it sigri-thats a girl ex-
claimed terrell hastily

  the girl came running to terrells
side as the car halted she looked ab-
surdly small in her khaki shirt and
short skirt her dark head was bare
and there was a smudge of grease on
her firm little chin

  youre an american she cried to
terrell thank heaven im ruth
dunn nurse with the american hospital
unit ive two wounded men i have to
get up the road and my ambulance
smashed its axle

  terrell now saw the men behind her
one was a haggard youngster in the
slate blue of the royal air force his
arm in a sling the other was a chi-
nese officer with an imperturbable olive
face who leaned on a makeshift crutch
as he puffed a cigarette

  theyre lieutenant aleck harris
and captain yuan chi of the route
army ruth dunn continued eagerly
i can make them comfortable among
the supplies in your back seat

  sorry but im not going up the
road terrell reluctantly told the girl
im forking off it a few miles from here
and heading north

  the nurses brown eyes grew stormy
lost city of burma



and scornful you know the japs will
drive on up the road and you figure the
northern jungles will be safer-is that
it well you cant go north-these men
cant be left here to be slaughtered
terrell set his teeth he had never
faced a harder task than to leave this
girl and the two wounded men here in
doomed lashio

  but he had to do it he knew the
mission upon which he was engaged was
too all-important to be thwarted by hu-
manitarian impulses

  its impossible he said stonily
drive on sigri

  the burmese hesitated maybe
after all we had better go up the road
than north sahib he suggested hope-
fully

  sigri didnt want to go north terrell
could see his mention of the legendary
land of yamaya of the fabled flame of
life had roused the mans supersti-
tions that was why terrell hadnt
told sigri the direction they would take
until the last moment before departure

  you heard me he rapped to the
servant get going

  harris the raf pilot stared at him
incredulously as though unable to be-
lieve that an american was actually
deserting them the chinese officer
puffed his cigarette without change of
expression

dut ruth dunn her face white with
anger suddenly acted before ter-
rell could realize her intention she
snatched the pistol out of his belt hol-
ster and leveled it at his head

  were going up the road she
blazed if you value your skin as
highly as you seem to youll change
your plans

  terrell felt a shock of alarm and dis-
may for a moment he meditated
snatching to recover his gun

  but ruth dunns snapping brown

eyes had such scorn and determination
in them that he knew such a move
would be fatal she thought he had
refused to help her because of cowardly
solicitude for his own safety and she
wouldnt hesitate a moment to shoot
him and take the car

  boom the crash of bombs sud-
denly dominating the death-throes of
the burning town behind them put a
period to the tense moment

  if we dont go quick the japs get
us sure shrilled sigri

  all right-get in terrell grated to
the girl you hold the high card

  ruth helped the limping chinese and
the britisher with the shattered arm
into the back seat of the car she got
in with them sitting crampedly amid
the gasoline-cans and supplies back
there

  straight up the road to kun-ming
she ordered sigri and added in the
native burmese tongue tik ao

  sigri needed no command to go fast
the car rabbitted ahead along the
gravel highway away from the doomed
town

  terrells thoughts were a confusion
of dismay he had to retrieve this dis-
astrous situation somehow he must
get northward before the japs cut off
the way there and forestall him

  if only he were a free agent hed go
to any risk to help the american nurse
and her charges those two men had
been wounded fighting the common en-
emy of civilized nations but he wasnt
a free agent-and he couldnt tell these
people why he wasnt

  ruth dunn was looking back though
the pistol still rested on her knee with
its muzzle trained on terrells back
her soft face was white in the lurid red
glare of burning lashio

  it-its like the end of the world
she said unsteadily like a horrible
nightmare


fantastic adventures

  i have seen all this many times be-
fore in china in the last five years
yuan chi said quietly we have re-
treated much from the japanese but
very soon i think that we will retreat
no longer

  yuans right-well be back here
gritted aleck harris the raf pilots
haggard face was grim and when
we come back well give them hell with
bells on

  terrell turned his attention back to
the highway ahead in the splash of
the headlights the wreckage of an
evacuating horde strewed the way
cases of supplies that had been aban-
doned pitiful heaps of native posses-
sions a few straggling dazed-looking
burmese

  but most of the burmese populace
was far ahead streaming up the road
toward china in frantic flight from the
merciless invaders somewhere up
ahead too the chinese and british and
american commands were organizing a
new line of resistance while the sacri-
ficial rear-guard held lashio to the last
minute

  gray mists were beginning to swirl
up into the bobbing glow of the head-
lamps dawn was not far away ter-
rell knew then his heart jumped as
he saw that they were passing the rude
oxcart road that forked northward off
the road

  that was his own way that rude
trail led into the unmapped northern
jungles that hid the thing he must find
but already they had passed the fork
were climbing on up the looping grades
of the road

  terrell tried a desperate appeal
listen i cant go this way ive sim-
ply got to go northward

  ruth dunns voice was a whiplash of
contempt i never before realized
there could be americans like you
worrying about yourself when thou-

sands of men have died back there and
are still dying

  terrell groaned inwardly if he
could only tell this girl the truth and
convince her of it but he had pur-
posely left all credentials behind and
shed think his story merely a panic-
born falsehood

yawn was filtering grayly through
the mists level fingers of sun-
light reached from the east and began
to disclose the great shoulders of gray-
green land across which the road
wound northeastward

  almost instantly as the protective
veil of darkness was lifted there came
the whine of motors from the heavens
behind them

  planes exclaimed aleck harris
theyd be japs coming up to strafe
the evacuation on the road

  maybe theyre american volunteer
fliers ruth said hopefully looking
back up at the misty sky

 no chance-the avg chappies
bases were all knocked out after theyd
smashed the japs five times running
harris replied im afraid were in
for it-

  terrell yelled warning to sigri at
that moment he had heard the drone
of motors roaring suddenly louder and
lower

  two planes with the sinister emblem
of the rising sun upon their wings were
diving toward them machine-gun
bullets stitched the gravel alongside
them as sigri swerved the car to the left

  the planes roared overhead-the
burmese driver frantically braked as
terrell shouted it was not a moment
too soon for the stick of bombs ex-
ploded in geysers of spouting dirt just
ahead of them

  their car rocked from the blast and
terrell felt gravel pattering down on
them the planes were roaring onward
lost city of burma



in search of other prey

  terrell saw his chance ruth dunn
was clutching at the door of the rear
seat to right herself he reached swiftly
back and snatched the pistol from her
hand before she recovered her pres-
ence of mind

  now turn around sigri terrell
cried go back to that northward
fork 

  you coward cried the girl and
aleck harris rose in the seat his face
raging and his uninjured hand balling
into a fist

  get back down there both of you
terrell barked holding the gun im
going north as i planned and leaving
you three here

  frightened sigri had spun the car
back to the fork they had passed but a
few moments before as they reached
it the burmese uttered a hoarse cry
and pointed back along the winding
road toward lashio

  the invaders are coming

  the sun flooded everything with
brazen light now terrell could plainly
see swift gray scout-cars racing out of
lashio toward them they were miles
away but coming fast

  that means the japs have bypassed
our rear-guard holding lashio he mut-
tered

  his eyes swung to the furious girl
and the two wounded men

  i meant to leave you three here to
be picked up by our rear-guard when
it evacuated but i cant do that now
he said rapidly the japs have gained
the road and theyd cut you down on
sight

  why should you care about that as
long as your own skin is safe ruth
flamed at him

  terrell ignored her words youve
got to go north with me now not all
the way-but ill take you far enough
that you may be able to cut east across

country to kun-ming its the best i
can do

  sigri had swung the car into that
oxcart road leading northward ahead
of them loomed the green wall of the
jungle that swallowed up this rude na-
tive highway the car bumped and
lurched in the ruts

  terrell looked back tensely had
those jap scout cars sighted them it
didnt matter-sooner or later there
would be japs after them he was fore-
bodingly certain of that

  he looked ahead again the un-
mapped wilderness of northern burma
was like a great ocean of jungle into
which they were launching could he
find in it the fantastic object of his des-
perate quest before he was forestalled

           chapter ii
           jungle mystery

jdrooding silence wrapped the hot
steamy green jungle the grassy
glare of the noonday sun stabbing
down through the lush foliage of the
tropical forest had driven the chatter-
ing monkeys and screeching parrots to
the shade not even a vulture flew now
across the wild wooded hills

  but down in the green gloom of the
jungle floor the battered car chugged
steadily northward it was now fol-
lowing the bed of a small stream dry
and baking at this season it seemed
moving along a tunnel through solid
vegetation for towering teak and
pyinkado trees drooped branches trail-
ing with lianas overhead constantly
the vehicle detoured to avoid boulders
in the dry stream-bed

  terrell mopped perspiration from his
face and looked anxiously backward
for the hundredth time during the last
two days

  ruth dunns soft lips tightened


fantastic adventures

scornfully you neednt be so fright-
ened now she said scathingly the
japs are not going to pursue a little
party like this one all the way weve
come

  that terrell told her grimly is
where youre wrong therell be a jap
party coming up this way after us i
know it

  aleck harris snorted disgustedly i
say you really do have the wind up
dont you

  terrell ignored the taunt and the
cool amusement in yuan chis eyes
hed become hardened to the detesta-
tion and contempt of his three unwill-
ing passengers in the last two days

  he had pushed relentlessly north-
ward in those two days first by ox-
cart roads between villages then across
a ford of the shian river into the wilder
northern jungles by elephant trails and
dry watercourses it had been tropical
travel at its worst with the menace of
tiger and leopard and snake less hard
to bear than the steamy heat and the
insects

  by a miracle the battered car had
held together and kept chugging on
but they were now penetrating an al-
most uninhabited wilderness having
passed no village all this day and
the last spare can of gasoline had been
emptied into the tank

  sigri looked anxiously at him
pretty soon the car stops sahib
terrell nodded there should be
one last village of kachin tribesmen
close ahead if my information is cor-
rect im hoping to trade there for
horses

  he looked a little uncertainly back
at ruth im going on north from
there the best chance for you three
is to get horses too and strike east
toward china

  you dont intend to be bothered
from here on by a couple of wounded

men do you ruth dunn said bit-
terly

  no i dont terrell answered dog-
gedly i cant be hampered by any-
body

  not for the world would we hamper
your mad rush to save your hide ruth
said stingingly well stay in that
village until aleck and yuan chi are
better able to travel

  you mustnt stay there terrell
warned earnestly the japs will be
up this way after us very quickly

  really old man you must think the
mikados whole army is invading
burma solely to do you in scoffed
young harris

  at that moment the jungle began
abruptly to thin out as the car lurched
around a bend of the dry stream-bed
they were entering a small man-made
clearing in the great forest but that
fact was for the moment less arresting
than the tremendous landscape they
could see in the farther distance

  jungle-blanketed hills rolled far
away on all sides a forbidding wilder-
ness miles to the north a great pla-
teau shouldered up for nearly a mile
above the forest floor that brutal up-
thrust of the terrain ran east and west
for many miles and appeared itself to
be swathed by tropic forests it tow-
ered stark and mighty dominating the
whole vista

hphe plateau of yamaya gasped
sigri superstitious awe and rev-
erence leaping into his eyes as he
stared the land of the gods

  terrells pulse jumped then the
land yamaya where the flame of life
exists is supposed to be a plateau like
that

  sigri answered fearfully the leg-
ends say so but i do not know any-
thing about it i have never before
been near it no burmese would dare
lost city of burma



set foot upon the sacred plateau
aleck harris was staring at the dis-
tant plateau in wonder weird look-
ing place that hasnt it ever been
explored

  few white men have ever been up
even this far terrell retorted the
whole country north of here is a sort
of unknown no-mans-land between
burma tibet and china

  but i should think that a plane
could- began the british pilot

  a plane couldnt land anywhere
within hundreds of miles of here-there
isnt a clearing in the jungle big
enough terrell told him

  as he spoke his eyes were intently
scanning the frowning rock wall of the
distant plateau he noted a zigzag
crack up its side

  i think i see a way up there he
muttered if only-

  yuan chi was saying speculatively
ive heard of the legendary land of
yamaya and the flame of life tell
me terrell-why are you so interested
in those ancient stories

  terrell was spared an answer a
babble of shrill cries broke out close
ahead their car was chugging toward
a high bamboo stockade that enclosed
a village of several dozen straw-
thatched huts

  brown native tribesmen in white
loincloths and turbans were running
with their bows and spears in answer
to the alarm women who had been
tilling the narrow belt of cultivated land
around the jungle village were retreat-
ing hastily to the protection of the
stockade

  this is the last kachin village
terrell said rapidly that must be
the headman coming ill do the talk-
ing

  the car was chugging into the en-
closure and creaking tiredly to a stop
beside the thatched huts there were a

few round paltarais or granaries for
storing unhusked rice a rude corral
that held a dozen tough little hill
ponies and a small hpoongyi-kyaung
or buddhist temple

  the brown-faced tribesmen were
chattering excitedly as they gathered
around the car innumerable pariah
dogs ran yapping through the crowd
to add to the din came an unearthly
roar from a huge striped tiger prisoned
in one of a row of bambo cages beside
the flimsy little temple

  terrell got out of the car and ap-
proached the headman a withered old-
ster beside whom stood the shaven-
headed yellow-robed hpoongyi or
priest the american spoke in a north-
ern dialect of the burmese

  we are friends come to trade we
bring knives axes things you need
greatly in return we desire a few of
your horses so that we may go on from
here

  we have horses answered the
headman cautiously but these things
must be talked over first in my house

  terrell despite his feverish impa-
tience to move on knew better than to
try to hurry a burmese in bargaining
he turned back to the others

  well get the horses all right-they
always need steel tools he said but
itll take a little time you may as
well come along into the shade

ruth dunn and the two wounded
men accompanied terrell toward
the biggest of the thatched huts the
girl looked at him curiously

  how do you happen to know their
language so well she asked

  my father was a missionary to this
country and i grew up here terrell
answered thats why i was chosen-

  he stopped abruptly and the girl
stared at him puzzledly they were
now entering the cool dimness of the


fantastic adventures

big hut

  they seated themselves on brilliant-
colored mats and the headman and the
hpoongyi sat opposite them

  is it true that there is a great war
in the south the tribe leader asked
one has said that yellow monkey-men
have come from the far east into this
land

  its true terrell answered grimly
and i fear the monkey-men will come
here too that is why we wish the
horses to leave here

  the old headman asked keenly in
what direction do you plan to go
the girl and these two men will go
east terrell replied my servant and
i go north

  the hpoongyi uttered a sharp ex-
clamation and made an excited gesture
the old headman also appeared dis-
turbed

  you cannot go north  he told ter-
rell earnestly there is no way
around the sacred plateau and you
cannot go over it for it is forbidden for
any human to set foot upon the lofty
land of the gods

  do- you tribesmen never climb the
plateau terrell asked skeptically

  never answered the hpoongyi
emphatically only once each moon
we go to the base of the plateau and
make sacrifice to the gods of light who
war eternally with the gods of evil up
there two days hence we will sac-
rifice the tiger you saw in the cages
outside

  terrell was fishing for information
then there are gods of evil up there
on the sacred land also

  aye ancient gods of darkest wick-
edness answered the buddhist priest
fervently they are the nagas the
dread serpent-people

  terrell recognized an ancient legend
all over the east stories were told of
the serpent-men who had existed in the

dawn of time these nagas whose
very name meant snake in the hindu
tongue had been worshipped once by
millions and still were widely dreaded

  but is it not written terrell re-
minded pointedly that the great king
anahrwata and his buddhist warriors
wiped out the last of the nagas many
hundreds of years ago

  it is so written conceded the
priest but the nagas who dwelt up
there in the sacred land could not be
killed for they had breathed of the
flame of life

  terrell leaned forward eagerly
then you believe that one who
breathes the flame of life cannot be
killed tell me what is the flame
how should i know who have never
been up there in the sacred land where
it exists countered the hpoongyi
why are you so interested in the
flame

  terrell knew better than to answer
truthfully to that i have no interest
in it i wish only to escape northward
to tibet

  i think you lie said the old head-
man with sudden harshness you plan
to commit sacrilege by climbing to the
sacred land

  yuan chi had followed the exchange
intently for he apparently knew much
more of the burmese tongue than the
smattering possessed by ruth dunn
and harris now he looked keenly at
terrell

  terrell what is your game the
chinese officer asked in english have
you got some wild idea-

tte never finished the words they
were stricken from his lips by an
appalling interruption that came from
outside

  a tribeswomans shriek of terror was
the only warning it was followed al-
most instantly by a roar of motors and
lost city of burma



a staccato crash of rifle and sub-ma-
chine gun fire

  the japs cried terrell i knew
theyd be coming up this way after
us-

  his automatic jumped into his hand
as he lunged for the door of the hut
the scene out in the sunlit village was
heart-checking

  two gray japanese scout-cars were
roaring in through the open gate of
the stockade each had a half-dozen
swart-faced occupants jap riflemen
and sub-machine gunners who were
blazing at the stupefied natives

  the attack was as brutal as unex-
pected and as merciless as was japa-
nese custom slugs slammed into petri-
fied native men and women before they
could even understand they were at-
tacked those who tried to raise their
pitiful bows were cut down before they
could use them

  devils from hell  hissed yuan chi
his slant eyes blazing hatred if i had
a company of my men-

  out of here  terrell yelled there
comes sigri with the car

  the burmese servant who had been
waiting in the car had started it and
was heading it across the wild confu-
sion of the village toward them

  terrells pistol kicked in his hand as
he ran forward to meet the car keeping
ruth dunn behind him he got one
of the sub-machine gunners in the
scout-cars and wounded another but
a japanese officer shouted orders a
blast of fire swept in their direction

  the stream of lead hit the car which
was braking to a stop in front of them
bullets flung sigri forward over the
wheel as though he had been hit a
mightly blow in the back

  sahib- he sighed and died on
the word

  terrells heart swelled with rage at
the slaughter of his loyal servant but

he wasted no time death was too
close to them all

  he shoved ruth dunn and the two
men into the car pushed sigris lifeless
form aside and tossed his pistol to
yuan chi as he floorboarded the accel-
erator

  hold on-were going out that
gate he yelled

  the car jumped forward just in time
to miss a second blast of sub-machine
gun fire from the jap scout-cars ter-
rell flung the battered machine between
the huts of the village momentarily
masking the enemy fire

  he swung around and headed back
through the huts toward the gate in
the stockade the village was a mad
confusion women were shrieking
men yelling their war-cry dogs howl-
ing the caged tiger roaring

  here we go terrell cried keep
down ruth-try to get that officer
yuan

  its motor roaring the battered car
shot out from among the huts into the
clearing within the stockade gate ter-
rell hunched low hurled the old ma-
chine close past the two jap scout-cars

  rifle bullets whizzed over his head
but the japs hadnt time to get the
deadly sub-machine guns going be-
sides one car blocked the others line
of fire the stocky spectacled jap of-
ficer was shouting a command

  two nipponese riflemen who were
leveling their guns directly at terrell
slumped and collapsed as yuan chis
automatic barked

  look out terrell yelled aleck
harris at that moment

  terrell saw the danger the very
moment when the open gate of the
stockade promised escape only a few
yards ahead the driver of the near-
est jap scout-car was swinging his ma-
chine to block the gate

  terrell tried a lightning swerve but


fantastic adventures

the wheel of his old car was not re-
sponsive enough to make it his radi-
ator banged into the side of the heavy
scout-car and caromed off it into the
log stockade

rjhe shock smacked terrells head
against the windshield and for a few
moments everything was a dazed con-
fusion to him he came out of it to
find jap soldiers swarming onto his
wrecked car and to hear the stocky
officer shouting shrilly

  dont kill the american-take them
alive  he knew enough japanese to
understand the shrill order

  ruth dunn her face white with
loathing was striking with little
clenched fists at the swart soldier drag-
ging her from the car yuan chi had
been stunned by a rifle-butt and harris
was held by two japs

  terrell knew that hed failed-not
merely in his attempted escape from
the village but in his whole vital mis-
sion and that icy knowledge tripped
a flare of unreasoning fury in his brain

  his fists smashed the swart face of
the jap soldier dragging ruth from the
car another jap who rushed in to
help got terrells knee in his stomach-
he knew the sons of nippon too well to
waste any sportsmanship on them

  it wasnt any use he knew it even
while his furious fists were flailing the
yellow invaders from in front of him
he knew it with complete finality
when a pistol-barrel prodded his back

  that hissed an authoritative voice
in english behind him will be enough
i shall have to kill you if you continue
resistance

  terrell dropped his hands and stood
 breathing hard his access of blind
 fury was cooling but the icy feeling of
 failure deepened

 ruth was beside him unhurt jap
 riflemen viciously prodded the dazed

yuan chi to his feet beside aleck har-
ris they were herded into a little row
by the bruised soldiers whose black
eyes glared their hatred

  the stocky jap officer holstered his
pistol and eyed the four prisoners he
was a pudgy little man with a plump
saffron mask of a face and glittering
spectacles that veiled blandly cunning
eyes

  let me introduce myself he said
in english marred only by a slight sibi-
lance i am major hirota imperial
japanese army on special service

  terrell made no answer but hirota
continued unperturbedly

  and you are captain john terrell
of the united states army intelli-
gence

  ruth and the chinese and britisher
all looked badly startled the girl
stared from hirota to terrells taut
face

  terrell-an intelligence officer of
our army

  hirota smiled at her you did not
know yes it is quite true captain
terrell was sent up here to beat me to
the thing i am after-the flame of
life

chapter iii
land of the gods

jperrell was too crushed by his
sickening sense of disastrous fail-
ure to be interested in his companions
reaction to the disclosure

  for he had failed and miserably
he had let this japanese agent catch
up to him had lost a great game for
vital stakes before it began only
dogged determination kept his mental
agony from showing on his face

  i dont know what youre talking
about he told hirota harshly i am
simply a businessman caught in burma
lost city of burma



by the invasion i know nothing about
any flame of life

  hirotas glittering smile deepened
dont overdo your denials captain
terrell everyone who has spent any
time in the east has heard of the flame
of life

  obviously enjoying his position of
power the japanese continued for
ruths benefit the flame of life is
supposed to be a wonderful something
that can make men immortal a man
who breathes the flame they say can-
not be killed the story has always
been that the flame exists upon a for-
bidden hidden tableland called yam-
aya which is inhabited by the mighty
gods of old

  hirota laughed heartily of course
we japanese the enlightened master-
race put no belief in such childish
fables we know the flame is prob-
ably only some unusual jewel or min-
eral deposit but these superstitious
peoples whom we are now conquering
believe in it and if we possess our-
selves of this so-called flame we can
play upon their superstitions to domi-
nate them utterly their beliefs will
make them think us japanese immortal
and irresistible if they know we pos-
sess the flame thats why i was de-
tailed when the invasion of burma was
planned to come north here and seek
out the so-called flame

  very interesting terrell remarked
coolly but i dont see what it has to
do with us

  hirota looked annoyed really
your obstinacy is typically yankee i
know that your army leaders got wind
of my proposed expedition to secure
the flame and that they sent you to get
the flame before i could secure it
youre dreaming terrell replied
calmly it all sounds like a crazy
fairy story to me

  hirotas teeth showed these de-

nals are quite useless my information
is that that plateau to the north is the
supposed location of the flame un-
doubtedly you were heading for it when
we caught up to you

  the officer turned as a jap non-com
came up to make a report it gave
terrell a chance to glance around at his
companions

  harris seemed bewildered by what he
had heard but yuan chi had listened
with a queerly intent interest showing
in his eyes

  ruth dunn was looking with horror
and pity around the village the up-
roar had quieted now except for the
continued roaring of the enraged tiger
in the cages outside the little temple

  a third of the brown tribesmen lay
dead between their huts among them
the old headman and the hpoongyi
most of the others had fled into the
jungle but a few dozen had been
rounded up ia a huddle of prisoners

  hirota had turned back to terrell
my men have been unable to obtain
any coherent information about that
plateau from these degraded tribesmen
however i learn that you were confer-
ring with the headman and hpoongyi
about the plateau undoubtedly they
gave you some information

  terrell shrugged the jap continued
blandly they are unfortunately dead
but you can tell me what you learned
from them about the plateau it will
be of considerable value to me in my
quest

  you dont really expect to get any
sort of help from me terrell coun-
tered contemptuously

  i was afraid you would take that
attitude said hirota hi spectacles
glittered let me remind you that
your lives depend upon my orders

 leck harris said scathingly
go ahead and shoot us then-you

a


fantastic adventures

will anyway its what we expect from
the famous samurai chivalry

  that taunt got under hirotas skin
his thin lips compressed but he kept
his voice quiet

  oh no i would not have you people
shot he said i would not dream of
doing that but there are other ways
his mouth twitched in a smile as his
eyes looked beyond them toward the
temple cages in which the big striped
tiger was still growling

  that tiger looks as though he had
been starved the jap officer remarked
i wonder just what he would do to
helpless victims

  terrells neck corded with emotion
and his voice was thick so thats
what youre going to threaten me with
it wont do you any good hirota

  i think it will hirota said
smoothly the white races have a
foolishly exaggerated regard for the
safety of their women you will not
want this girl to die under the tigers
claws

  terrell stiffened are you crazy
this girl and these two soldiers have
nothing to do with me theyre simply
fugitives from lashio and youre bound
to treat them as prisoners of war
hirota shrugged you are an enemy
spy and they were captured in your
company i am forced to treat them as
spies also

  terrell saw the horror in ruth
dunns brown eyes and it made him
ball his fists and take a furious step
toward their pudgy captor

  save it terrell murmured aleck
harris heavily the japs dont go by
the rules of war remember what hap-
pened at hong kong

  you will give me what information
you possess about the plateau in ex-
change for the young womans safety
hirota asked keenly of terrell

  terrell hesitated torn by conflicting

emotions he had not actually learned
much about the plateau from the
hpoongyi and headman but hirota
thought he had if the jap would stick
to his bargain it meant that the plucky
girl behind him would escape a hor-
rible death

  no he couldnt do it he couldnt
give hirota even the smallest scrap of
information that might help the jap
in his quest for the flame of life that
legendary fetish would be too potent
a psychological weapon in the hands of
nippon

  ruth dunns clear voice interrupted
terrells frantic mental debate dont
tell him anything terrell she said
defiantly if theyre going to kill us
theyll do it anyway

  miss dunn is right said yuan chi
bitter hatred throbbing in his voice as
he eyed the japanese this creature
does not mean for any of us to escape
here

  i give you the word of a samurai
that these three people will be given
their freedom in exchange for your in-
formation hirota affirmed

  terrell answered scathingly saburo
kurusu showed the world what the
word of a samurai is worth when he
talked peace in washington while jap
bombers were flying toward pearl har-
bor

  a flash of rage crossed hirotas eyes
at that taunt then you will tell me
nothing

  terrells mind was made up i have
nothing to tell

  hirota shrugged you force me to
take extreme measures but i shall
give you a few hours to reconsider your
rash decision

  he uttered a staccato command in
his own language to the riflemen cover-
ing the four prisoners in english he
added

  to quicken your reconsideration i
lost city of burma



am going to confine you in the cage next
to that of the tiger the nearness of
the beast should have an excellent effect
upon your meditations you will please
step that way resistance to the com-
mand was out of the question two
bayoneted rifles were covering them
and hirotas hand rested on his pistol-
butt silently the four prisoners walked
toward the cages outside the temple

athere were four of the cages which
had obviously been built by the
tribesmen for the prisoning of those
trapped beasts intended as sacrifices
to the gods of the plateau they were
constructed of tough bamboo saplings
tied by thongs and each cage was sep-
arated from the next by a single row of
the bamboo bars

  hirotas men thrust terrell and his
three comrades into the cage next that
of the tiger then the two jap soldiers
took post outside its door which they
secured by a heavy cross-bar

  ah the animal is already giving
you an object lesson smiled hirota

  the tiger its green eyes blazing had
thrown itself with a hoarse roar at the
row of bars separating it from the four
prisoners

  ruth dunn shrank back againstter-
rell with a little cry of terror as the big
cages shook violently to the impact
he put his arm around her protectively

  its all right ruth the beast cant
break through those bamboo bars

  he cannot now but he could very
easily if we cut the thongs holding the
tops of the bars hirota said from out-
side their prison i want you to think
about that very earnestly during the
next hours

  the japanese looked at the sky
which was flushing red as the coppery
sun sank toward the western horizon

  you have until morning to think
things over he told terrell you will

have no longer than that for whether
or not you talk i leave here at dawn for
the plateau

  hirota went off across the village
leaving his two stumpy soldiers on
guard outside the door of the four
prisoners cage

  terrell looked sickly at his fellow
captives his eyes clinging finally to
ruths white face

  im sorry i got you three rtito this
mess with me he said heavily its
bad enough for me to fail without drag-
ging you into the consequences
ruths face softened its we who
ought to apologize for the way we be-
haved toward you since leaving lashio
why didnt you tell us you were an
army intelligence man you let us
think you were a coward

  terrell shrugged an intelligence
officer isnt supposed to blurt out his
mission to everyone-especially a mis-
sion like mine

  terrell this mission of your seems
fantastic to me aleck harris said puz-
zedly a flame of life that can make
men immortal you dont really think
there can be such a thing

  of course not terrell answered
but half the peoples of asia think
theres a thing with such powers and
thats the important point whatever
the flame may be its a fetish that
focuses the superstitions of millions of
eastern peoples they believe anyone
possessing it would be invulnerable un-
conquerable thats why its so import-
ant to prevent the japs from getting it
yuan chi spoke thoughtfully i
have heard the legends of the flame of
life many times it a very old and
very strong belief perhaps there is
more in it than mere superstition
aleck harris looked at the chinese
officer incredulously you dont mean
to say you put any credence in the
story why you were educated at


fantastic adventures

harvard university yuan-you ought
to know better

  there are things in the vastness of
asia that are much more ancient than
harvard university and its knowledge
yuan chi answered quietly

ywilight was falling the tiger
had ceased its charges against the
bamboo bars and now was crouched
upon its belly its blazing green eyes
glaring eerily at them through the
gloom its intent avid stare was more
terrible than its former roaring charges
the great beast must be starved ter-
rell knew-the tribesmen wouldnt
bother to feed an animal that was des-
tined for sacrifice

  firelight flared above the village as
laughing japanese soldiers set fire to
the granaries of the tribesmen others
of the soldiers were fastening the rude
hide saddles upon the squealing kicking
mountain ponies in the corral appar-
ently at hirotas orders hirota him-
self stood at the edge of the village his
pudgy figure staring toward the plateau

  the plateau stood out a black dis-
tant mass against the tropic stars ter-
rells eyes went hungrily toward it he
sought to make out by starlight the zig-
zag crack up its side a beaten trail of
the tribesmen led through the jungle
toward a point at the base of the plateau
that was quite near that crack if hed
only been able to reach it to climb to
that unmapped tableland and search
out the mysterious fetish-

  ruths hand touched his shoulder
lightly she said ruefully its all our
fault if you hadnt been hampered by
us you might have succeeded

   might have is a poor epitaph for
an intelligence agent on a vital mis-
sion terrell said somberly i let
hirota catch up to me and ive no one
to blame but myself

  his fists clenched but that jap

hasnt won the game yet if we can
get out of here and find the flame be-
fore he does-

  get out of here echoed ruth in a
startled whisper how can we those
two soldiers outside the cage will shoot
the moment we step out

  terrell nodded grimly they will
and theyll probably get us but isnt
it better than waiting until morning
for that

  and he jerked a thumb toward the
next cage in which the burning green
eyes still glared at them through the
deepening darkness

  he felt ruth shudder and shrink
against him aleck harris came over
to them with yuan chi limping after
him

  they talked in whispers the two
japanese soldiers outside the cage their
rifles gleaming in the starlight watched
them suspiciously

  were going to try a rush for it
terrell told the others if we make
it well grab horses from the corral
and ride for the plateau

  yuan chi said calmly i shall not be
entirely sorry to quit this incarnation
and ascend to a higher plane of exis-
tence

  he means its suicide to try it-and
it is terrell  harris whispered tensely
those two japs are ready to blast us
down any moment

  ive got a plan of sorts terrell
said tersely if i can get one of these
bamboo bars loose it might work

  he had been surreptitiously fumbling
at one of the bars of the back of the
cage against which they had crouched
as they talked his fingers had been
prying at the tough thongs that held the
bar in place the two watching guards
could not see the furtive effort

  its no good terrell muttered
aleck harris even if you could make
an opening big enough those two japs
lost city of burma



would knock us off before we could get
out through it

  thats not my plan rasped terrell
were going out through the front
door ah that does it

  his low exclamation came as he felt
the thongs loosening he had freed one
of the tough bamboo bars and now he
furtively drew it out of the wall it was
a thin springy sapling seven feet long

  you come with me harris terrell
directed tautly i want you to talk to
the guards and distract their attention
from me as much as possible ruth
you and yuan be ready to go

  the raf pilot went with him toward
the front of the cage terrell trailed
the bamboo bar behind him trusting
that the two jap guards would not be
able to see it in the vague starlight

  the japs had raised their rifles
threateningly as the two men ap-
proached the front of the cage the
tiger too stirred quickly

  i demand to see your officer aleck
harris told the japs in peremptory
tones whats the matter-cant you
understand me

ne of the stumpy guards said some-
thing to the other and they
laughed contemptuously at the english-
man but both kept their rifles on the
ready alert to prevent harris from ap-
proaching the barred cage-door

  harris kept on demanding to see
hirota the two japs began to get
angry at his insistence meanwhile
terrell had approached to within a few
feet of the barred front wall of the cage

  here goes he breathed to himself
tensing for the attempt

  with a sudden movement he put his
scheme into action he thrust his bam-
boo sapling out through the bars of the
cage-wall

  he thrust it toward the feet of the
two jap soldiers and instantly ter-

rel levered it with all his force against
their ankles the two nipponese
yelled as they were tripped staggered
and fell

  terrell knew he had five seconds to
work in as the two japs staggered
and began to fall the american was al-
ready snatching the bamboo bar back
inward and thrusting it out again
through the bars of the door he swept
it upward lifting the heavy cross-bar of
the door and plunged outward with the
sapling gripped like a spear

  the two japs were scrambling to
their feet yelling shrilly in alarm one
was raising his rifle terrell drove the
butt of the sapling into his face and
the jap screamed and staggered back
from the crunching blow

  the other man had dropped his rifle
in the fall and was stooping wildly for
it terrell swept the bambo down upon
the back of the japs neck with all his
strength the man sagged limp his
vertebra snapped

  by heaven you did it aleck har-
ris was crying yuan-ruth-come
on

  but terrell held them back inside the
cage wait a minute

  the yells of the two guards had given
the alarm hirotas voice was blaring
orders across the village and there was
a rush of running feet toward the cages

  terrell knew those hastening japs
would shoot him and his companions
down before they could reach the horse-
corral there was one expedient left
and he seized it he jumped toward
the door of the tigers cage

  the great beast was clawing furi-
ously at his bars and had been roaring
ragingly since first aroused by the up-
roar terrell unbarred and flung open
the gate of that cage and hastily leaped
back into the one in which he and his
comrades had been confined

  good god breathed harris ap-


fantastic adventures

palled by what instantly followed

  the starved tiger had bounded out
through the open door of its cage like
a huge striped projectile the leap
brought him face to face with the jap
soldiers running toward the cages

  the japs shrilled in terror and fired
but the beast was already among them
its claws and talons flashing in the star-
light before that snarling spitting
fury the japs broke wildly the tiger
leaped after them

  now to the corral terrell cried
weve only a minute

  he had snatched up the rifles of the
two fallen guards handing one of the
weapons to harris ruth was beside
terrell her face white under the stars
as they ran for the corral yuan chi
kept pace with the other three his face
showing none of the agony his shat-
tered ankle was enduring

  they got into the corral while the
uproar of shots and cat-snarls was rag-
ing unabated across the village the
scrawny horses shied and kicked at the
smell of strangers terrell with diffi-
culty caught one and helped yuan chi
into its rude saddle

  harris had got ruth dunn onto a
horse and was scrambling on another
himself awkwardly trying to hang onto
his rifle but the pony whose bridle
terrell had grabbed seemed to have the
devil himself in him and danced about
like mad to prevent his mounting

  terrell hurry yelled the english-
man theyve finished the tiger and
theyre coming-

  an explosion of rifles across the vil-
lage had terminated the tigers blood-
chilling roars hirotas frantic voice
was yelling orders

  ride for it terrell shouted im
coming

tjte had finally got his leg over the
back of the bucking pony rifle-

slugs sang close over their heads in the
starlight

  frightened their horses bolted to-
gether out of the corral they thun-
dered across the village toward the open
gate of the stockade in the red glow
of the smoldering granaries terrell saw
hirota shooting at them with his pistol
japs with sub-machine guns were run-
ning up

  but they were outside the stockade
in the next moment the scared little
horses running like mad across the
tilled fields around the village

  this way shouted terrell reining
his horse hard toward the right

  the moon was rising an enormous
silver disk pushing above the eastern
jungle its light showed the narrow
trail of the tribesmen that ran north-
ward through the jungle toward the dis-
tant plateau

  terrell and his comrades were gal-
loping along that trail a moment later
the uproar back at the village was
swallowed up but there was sound
about them-night-noises of the jungle
the screech of startled monkeys the
distant crash of an elephant through
brush the whooshing sound of a black
flying-fox diving across the silver moon

  trailing vines whipped and stung
their faces and branches projecting into
the trail tried to tear them from the
saddles they were riding single-file
now with terrell in the lead and the
first mad rush of the horses was drop-
ping into a steady gallop

  aleck harris laugh came over the
rush of hoofs id like to see hirotas
fat face right now

  dont fool yourself-that jap will
be after us with all his men as soon as
they can round up the horses terrell
warned and weve got to climb that
plateau

  but desperate hope was now singing
through his own mind he wasnt beaten
lost city of burma



yet there was still a chance to find
the fabled flame of life before hirota

  the mystery of the moonlit jungle
through which they galloped the
greater mystery of the lost land toward
which they were riding woke strange
new speculations in terrells chaotic
thoughts what if yuan chi were right
and there was more to the flame of
life than mere superstition what if
a great secret of ancient asia lay some-
where ahead of them

he shook off that eery thought impa-
tiently just nerves-and no wonder

  the horses were tiring as miles of
jungle trail unreeled behind them ter-
rell looked anxiously back each few
minutes

  theres the plateau  aleck harris
cried suddenly a little later and then
good lord we cant climb that

phe thick jungle was giving way to
more open ground glades of tall
trees dappled black-and-silver by the
brilliant moonlight they were within
a short distance of the stupendous wall
of the plateau

  a massive jagged rock precipice that
loomed up thousands of feet in the
moonlight it extended east and west
out of sight there were inky black
cracks in its side and crags of metallic
minerals that glittered brightly in the
moon

  the big zigzag crack in the side was
a little east of here terrell said rap-
idly to his companions it looked
climbable

 ruth dunns soft face looked
stunned as she stared up at the gigan-
tic frowning cliffs

  it scares me she said shakily it
looks as though it might really be a
land of gods

  terrell was already urging his tired
pony eastward along the base of the
cliff they passed a big curiously-

carved stone altar obviously that at
which the tribesmen sacrificed to the
gods of the plateau in a few minutes
they came to the base of the big zigzag
crack

  terrells eyes tensely followed that
rift in the side of the moonlit cliff
when he had dismounted from his pony

  i think we can make it he said
tautly we might as well turn these
horses loose

  yuan chi spoke quietly you three
can make it i would only be in the
way i will stay here and give hirotas
mien a little reception

  ill not go and leave yuan ruth
dunn said instantly and aleck harris
nodded agreement

  youve got to come-were losing
our chances by lingering here terrell
told the chinese officer sharply ill
help you and-listen

  the drum of distant hoof beats came
clear above the jungle noises growing
rapidly nearer and louder

  hirota and his men cried terrell
come on

  without waiting to argue further with
yuan chi he took the chinese officers
arm and helped him limp hastily toward
the base of the great angled rift in the
cliff ruth and aleck harris followed
quickly

  that zigzag crack up the precipice
was not as climbable a way as it had
looked from the distance terrell found
at once the gradients were so steep
that they would have been impossible
had it not been that fallen rock and
detritus gave a foothold

  there they are exclaimed aleck
harris a few minutes later looking
tautly back downward

  the fugitives had toilsomely as-
cended a third of the cliffs face but
now hirota and three of his soldiers
galloped their horses into view down
there at the base of the cliff


fantastic adventures

  the three jap soldiers had each
brought one of the heavy deadly sub-
machine guns and extra clips hirota
led them up the zigzag rift in pursuit

  keep back against the wall as much
as you can and well be out of their
range terrell said hastily

  the sub-machine guns turned loose
a moment later that the pursuing
japs could see them only vaguely in
the shadow of the crack was proved by
the fact that the first bursts spanged
off the cliff far above

  harris turned raising his rifle to his
uninjured shoulder and firing rapidly
back down the cliff-face at their pur-
suers one of the jap sub-machine
gunners toppled off the face of the
precipice

  good work harris-but dont stop
again  terrell sweated theyre over-
taking us

  he could hear the yelping cries of the
officer and two men still pursuing them
bullets continued to scream off the
rocks around them as the remaining two
sub-machine guns fired intermittent
bursts

  terrells heart was pounding from
exertion as he toiled on up the zigzag
way one hand clutched his rifle the
other aided yuan chi

  you will soon be overtaken if you
continue to hamper yourself with me
the chinese officer was saying urgently
give me one of the rifles and leave me
behind to-

chrill cries of triumph interrupted

   hirota and his two men had come
around an angle of the rift just below
them the japs could plainly see the
four fugitives from this position

  aleck harris instantly dropped to his
knee and raised his rifle to aim again at
their pursuers

bam-bam-bam one of the hellish
sub-machine guns was already cutting

loose at him the raf pilot was
knocked over on his side

  alecks hit cried ruth darting
back to the fallen pilot

  just a graze panted harris scram-
bling up it caught my rifle

  machine-gun slugs had shattered
harris rifle and seared across his fore-
arm hirota and his two men were
running on up the rift shouting

  terrell let go of yuan chi turned
and levelel his own rifle he fired at
the glitter of hirotas spectacles but it
was the soldier behind the jap officer
who fell

  with savage satisfaction terrell let
the whole clip go then he saw that
with his first shot hirota had snatched
up the fallen mans sub-machine gun
and had skipped hastily back behind
an angle of the rock with his remaining
follower

  thats my last cartridge-weve got
to keep going now terrell exclaimed

  they were he estimated within a
few hundred feet of the summit of the
plateau his lungs seemed bursting
from the climb ruths knees gave way
under her and harris helped her along
as terrell was helping yuan chi

  mercifully the last long slanting
gradient of the rift was less steep they
struggled up over fallen boulders and
detritus toward the vista of moonlit
trees that marked the summit of the
plateau

  bam-bam the bullets screamed off
a rock beside terrell as they were near-
ing the top the glance he spared back-
ward showed hirota and his remaining
man coming up that last long grade
after them on the run

  if we just had a few more cartridges
now aleck harris was agonizing

  they stumbled up onto the top of the
plateau all around them towered a
mighty jungle as dense and forbidding
as the sea of moonlit jungle they could
lost city of burma



glimpse far below

  ruth sank to her knees again unable
to go further yuan chis face was dis-
torted by the agony he had endured on
that upward climb but terrell stag-
gered toward a big boulder imbedded
at the crest of the rift

  harris help me he gasped if
we can roll this down on hirota and his
man-our last chance-

  he had dug his empty rifle under the
boulder and was prying convulsively to
lever the big rock out of the ground and
send it thundering down on the two
nipponese who were coming rapidly up
the rift

  bullets sang around them as hirota
recognized their purpose the boulder
began to come out of the ground as
terrell and harris frantically levered
with the rifle the two japs spurted
fiercely not daring to pause again to
fire

  the boulder came loose it tottered
on the brink of the rift then with a
grumbling thunder started rolling down
the rift but hirota and his jap were
so close now that they were able to save
themselves from annihilation by leap-
ing up onto the plateau just as the rock
thundered past

  terrell screamed ruth dunn in
wild warning

  the two japs were scrambling up
from the wild leap that had saved them
hirota was raising his sub-machine gun
terrell leaped flailing his empty rifle
he knocked the heavy weapon from
hirotas grip

  instead of trying to recover it hirota
snatched his rifle he banged its butt
back against terrells face terrell felt
his head ring from the stunning blow
felt himself tottering-

  he was dimly aware of hirotas tri-
umphant face as the jap raised the
rifle-butt to smash at him again he
vaguely glimpsed harris struggling

with the other jap for his sub-machine
gun yuan chi hobbling forward-
suddently hirotas face froze in a
strangeexpression the jap officer re-
mained petrified with uplifted rifle
staring beyond terrell

  yuan chi also was staring stupe-
fiedly in the same direction and from
him came a strangled exclamation

  the gods cried the chinese in-
credulously the gods of yamayal
men had appeared like magic out of
the moonlit jungle around them-but
were they indeed men tall golden-
skinned figures they were warriors
garbed in glittering brazen armor and
helmets with big swords and spears
which were raised ready to slay ter-
rells party and the japs

  and these incredible golden men had
beasts with them-big snarling black
leopards whom they restrained by
leashes attached to jeweled collars
the leopards strained to get forward at
the strangers like hunting-dogs whining
to be released at prey

           chapter iv
           golden city

rjerrells already dazed mind
could not for a moment compass the
reality of these apparitions these
surely could not be real-these golden
men who held snarling black leopards
in leash as hunting-hounds

  the american struggled against a
superstitious awe it could not be that
the legends of asia were true and that
gods of light and gods of evil dwelt in
this lost land to admit that was to
admit that the flame of life itself
might be the supernatural thing that
fable stated

  all of them had been frozen until
now by the appearance of the menacing
golden men but now hirota stooped


fantastic adventures

quickly to pick up the heavy sub-ma-
chine gun that terrell had knocked
from his hands in the fight

  instantly came a bellow of warning
from the leader of the golden men he
was a huge figure a brawny grizzled
giant of a warrior whose short bristling
black beard and uptilted mustaches lent
an additional fierceness to his hard face
he raised his great sword as he shouted

  terrell could understand that warn-
ing cry the giant leader was speaking
in an archaic variant of the root-lan-
guage of the burmese

  let that thing lie where it is bel-
lowed the golden giant to hirota try
to pick it up and youll get a spear in
your heart

  hirota froze the threat was no idle
one spears of golden warriors were
raised covering them all before they
could make any attempt at resistance
these golden men could cut them down

  the giant captain pointed to the two
sub-machine guns the one lying at
hirotas feet and the other still held
by both aleck harris and the jap with
whom he had been contending for it

  get those things and bring them
here barked the big captain to two of
his warriors they must be weapons
of some kind the way that fellow just
tried to snatch one up shows that

  the giant warrior glared at them
when this had been done

  who are you strangers that fight
among yourselves and why are you
here in yamaya he demanded in his
deep growling bass

  then this is yamaya husked ter-
rell

  it is the land yamaya forbidden
to all outsiders rapped the fierce
giant and i am gron captain of
warriors of our city that is also called
yamaya speak-why have you dared
enter this land

  terrell strove for words with which

to explain the situation but the quick-
witted hirota was ahead of him

  i come as a friend to yamaya the
japanese officer said quickly to the
giant gron i represent the great mas-
ter-race of the outer world and i come
upon a mission to your ruler

  our king kuluun is at our city
growled the big captainr but how do
i know that you are speaking truth
about this mission to him

  he is not speaking truth terrell
cried he is an enemy to all the peo-
ples of this region which his countrys
armies have attacked

  grons fierce eyes swept from the
american to the japanese one of
you is lying he growled perhaps
both of you

  yuan chi chose this moment to ask
an unfortunate question the chinese
officer had been staring at the golden-
skinned warriors with extreme excite-
ment now he put an eager query to
the bristling captain

  if this is really the land of yamaya
then the flame of life is near here

phe yamayan warriors uttered a
chorus of raging cries at the ques-
tion they surged forward fiercely
raising their weapons menacingly

  grons bleak eyes were dangerously
narrowed as the big captain roared at
yuan chi and terrell did you come
here to seek the flame if so you die
here and now

  hirota saw and instantly took advan-
tage of the yamayans fierce reaction
the japanese spoke swiftly

  yes this man terrell and his com-
panions came here to seek the flame of
life i came here to warn you of
yamaya against the attempt that is
my mission to your ruler

  the cunning duplicity of the japa-
nese had its effect gron and the other
yamayans glared at terrell with con-
lost city of burma



centrated fury

  is this true bellowed gron to the
american are you among those evil
ones who would become slaves to the
accursed nagas to win to the flame
the nagas terrell was for a mo-
ment bewildered by the reference then
he remembered what the hpoongyi back
in the native village had declared-that
the ancient evil race of the nagas the
dreaded serpent-men of asian legend
still existed up on the forbidden pla-
teau

  terrell had put as little faith in that
wild tale as in the supernatural powers
credited to the flame of life but
these golden-skinned yamayans before
him seemed utterly certain of the reality
of the nagas

  the japanese is lying terrell ex-
claimed we came here only to pre-
vent him from seeking the flame
gron swore by buddha i think
youre all liars wed do best to kill
you all out of hand

 a young yamayan warrior spoke to
the angry captain the king kuluun
would want to question these stran-
gers he reminded he added signifi-
cantly it may be they have come here
by connivance with ibir

 gron snarled when he heard that
name of ibir if that cursed friend
of the nagas has conspired to bring
these strangers here-

 he broke off his bristling brows
meeting in a black frown as his massive
face wrinkled in thought finally he
spoke harshly

  im going to take you all to yamaya
city he barked well learn the truth
there if its true you came here by
connivance with ibir and his party
youll die unpleasantly

  he turned and rapped an order to his
warriors search these people and take
everything from them leave them
nothing for i think their weapons are

of a dangerous kind

  terrells party and the japs were
thoroughly searched even their pock-
et-knives were taken also the extra
clips of cartridges were taken from
hirota and his follower and put with
the two sub-machine guns

  bring those along gron ordered
the warrior who had the two heavy fire-
arms well learn later if those are
the thunder-weapons whose noise at-
tracted us

  terrell realized from that that gron
and his men had been on a hunting-
party when attracted here by the unac-
customed sound of gunfire

tawn was breaking as they were
marched by an almost invisible
path through the choking green jungle
it led to a more open glade in which a
half-dozen war-elephants waited they
were huge beasts with tusks armed by
sharp metal spikes and with low wooden
howdahs on their backs

  terrell and his three friends were
roughly thrust onto one of the kneeling
beasts and the two japanese upon an-
other gron mounted the lead animal
and bellowed an order the mahouts
goaded their mighty steeds and the
elephants silently swung northward
along a broader trail

  to terrell and his companions jolt-
ing in the low howdah it was like an
arabian nights dream-journey the
great swaying beasts the golden-
skinned armored riders the warriors
who walked alongside with the padding
black hunting-leopards in leash-they
were like a pageant of the legendary
past moving through the dawn-lit green
jungle

  terrell you heard them speak of
the nagas yuan chi was saying ex-
citedly if the serpent-men really ex-
ist here-

  thats impossible terrell inter-


fantastic adventures

rupted the nagas are only an old
legend

  yes a legend old as asia yuan
chi flashed there must be some-
thing to a story as anciently and uni-
versally believed as that of the serpent-
people who knows what weird semi-
human races rose from strange muta-
tions back in the worlds dawn

  he continued excitedly some of
that weird race might still exist here
remember what that hpoongyi said-
that nagas existed on this plateau who
could not die because they had breathed
the flame of life

  dont let imagination run away with
you yuan cautioned terrell weve
found here a lost colony of an archaic
asian race but that doesnt mean all
the superstitions about this plateau are
true

  he continued tensely what i cant
understand is the fiercely hostile at-
titude of these yamayans about the
flame of life they talk as though
they hate the flame

  but who is this ibir they talk about
whom they seem to suspect of having
connived to bring us here ruth asked
puzzledly

  i cant guess terrell confessed
weve jumped into the center of a flock
of weird mysteries the only thing cer-
tain is that whatever kind of fetish the
flame of life may be hirota will move
heaven and earth to grab it and get it
out of here and its my job to stop
him

  the sun had risen driving slanting
bars of rosy light through the interstices
of the jungle foliage as the elephants
shouldered tirelessly northward along
the trail one of the leashed black
leopards whined

  the pace quickened a little presently
they glimpsed open sky ahead they
were coming out of the dense jungle into
a large clear area-

  name of buddha gasped yuan
chi shaken out of even his chinese im-
perturbability by the vista ahead

  it cant be real denied harris
hoarsely there cant be a city here
like that

  their swaying elephant had passed
out of the jungle into a circle of open
land several miles in diameter at its
center rose a fantastically beautiful
metropolis towering in the sunrise
beautiful as a dream

  lost city of yamaya focus of all the
age-old fables of eastern lore shimmer-
ing in the rising sun before their eyes
lifting its golden towers and terraces
into the rose-flushed sky as though
newly created by shingrah whom the
burmese say first hammered out the
world

  but it looks as if it were all made
of gold ruth was gasping

  terrell had the same first impression
though he knew after a moment that it
was of warm bright-yellow stone that
the city was built

  yamaya the golden city of golden
men he whispered raptly

  he had seen the ruined city of pagana
far to the south in burma built long
ago by king anahrwata the great hero-
ruler of the buddhists and this place
was like a larger and living and more
glorious pagana

  it was all of golden-yellow stone-
the high protective wall the myriad
towers of dwellings markets and tem-
ples within the great palace-pagoda
whose lofty carven pinnacle brooded
over the whole metropolis the
greenery of gardens laced its golden
mass and a belt of tilled fields pastures
and orchards separated it from the
surrounding jungle

  if this is real why hasnt it ever
been discovered ruth dunn was ask-
ing in stunned tones

  no burmese would set foot on
lost city of burma



this forbidden plateau and no white
men have ever explored this region
terrell reminded her even planes
almost never fly across this vast sea of
jungle any flier who did get a distant
glimpse of this place would suppose it
another of burmas ruined cities

  i doubt if any outsiders other than
ourselves have seen this place for
centuries yuan chi declared his
black eyes glowed with excitement
this is an ancient buddhist city-king-
dom isolated for ages

rjerrells heart beat faster as
their ponderous elephant - steeds
shouldered toward the open gates of
the golden city was the flame of life
here he knew that hirota must be
asking himself the same question he
foresaw that in this fantastic lost city
he must contest a bitter struggle with
the tricky determined japanese

  inside the city their party moved
along paved streets of markets and ba-
zaars the golden-skinned people of
yamaya stared up wonderingly at the
strangers many of the men were war-
riors clad in shining brazen helmets and
armor other men wore turbans
jackets and baggy breeches of brilliant-
colored silks the garb of the girls and
women was a long silken robe and a
mantle over the hair

  gron was conducting his prisoners
toward the great palace-pagoda at the
center of the city it was cruciform in
cross-section a great golden-yellow pile
whose balconies and pillars were en-
crusted with fantastic carving that
reached its climax in the soaring central
tower the palace was surrounded by
gardens of wonderful beauty enclosed
by a low wall at whose portals armed
warriors stood on guard

  their elephants passed through the
portals and halted before the entrance
in the south transept of the palace

they knelt slowly at the mahouts com-
mand terrell helped his comrades
dismount from the howdah the two
japanese were also alighting from their
steed

  aleck harris haggard face looked
dazed as he stared upward i still
cant believe it-this place is like an
opium dream he exclaimed

  we may soon find it a mighty ugly
dream terrell warned anxiously it
seems that these yamayans sentence
to death anyone who tries to seek the
flame that puts us in a bad spot
gron the towering bearded captain
was stalking toward them his eyes
ran sourly over terrells group and
hirotas mask-like face

  youll follow me and await audience
with the king kuluun he growled
itll give you time to think up a few
more of your lies

  they were escorted by yamayan
warriors with drawn swords as they
entered the south transept of the palace
the broad north-south corridor along
which they were conducted bore upon
its walls a series of brilliant silken
tapestries depicting men and monsters
in battle

  this corridor intersected a similar
hallway that bisected the east-west
transepts of the palace the intersec-
tion was a round hall in which gron left
them under guard

  hirota approached terrell and spoke
coolly we are in great danger here
pointed out the spectacled japanese
would it not be wise for us to suspend
our own hostilities and pool our efforts
until we are out of that danger

  aleck harris looked at him incred-
ulously cheeky little beggar arent
you after trying to kill us you want
to go partners

  i wouldnt trust you for ten seconds
hirota spat terrell youd double-
cross us the moment we were of no fur-


fantastic adventures

ther use to you

  hirota laughed softly you amer-
icans have such a simple-minded de-
testation of cunning very well then-
each of us for himself

  he went back to the awe-struck
japanese soldier who had been captured
with him terrell eyed the two of
them forebodingly as they whispered

jphey waited under guard for more
than an hour that their advent
had created excitement in the palace
was evident by the hasty coming and
going of chamberlains and courtiers
they could glimpse during that time

  when terrell and his fellow-prisoners
were finally conducted by gron into a
long brilliant throne-room they found
it crowded by scores of the nobles of
yamaya they were led between these
silent men toward the burnished silver
throne upon which sat the ruler of this
lost city

  king kuluun was a young man with
something frank and handsome about
his beardless face that won terrells
liking his turban and silken jacket
and belt blazed with priceless jewels
and a pigeon-blood ruby of incredible
size formed the hilt of his curved sword

  these are the strangers highness
announced gron in his rumbling voice
theyre all liars if you ask me they
tell a lot of different stories but im
certain they came here seeking the
flame of life

  kuluun stiffened upon his throne
and his lips tightened again terrell
wondered at the fierce hostility of these
yamayans toward the flame

  its my opinion gron was conclud-
ing rancorously that ibir has some-
thing to do with their coming they
carried yonder weapons that made
sounds like thunder which first drew
our hunting-party to them perhaps
ibir was plotting to make use of them

and their weapons

  kuluuns brow darkened as he looked
at the captured sub-machine guns and
then at a yamayan noble in the front
of the throng of courtiers

  did you somehow send for these
strangers ibir the young king de-
manded ominously have you plotted
with them to commit the sacrilege of
seeking the flame

  ibir stepped forward he was a thin-
faced crafty-eyed yamayan of middle
age who did not quail at this menacing
question

  i never saw or heard of these
strangers before now ibir declared
if they are seeking the flame i know
nothing about it

  but you yourself have been inciting
the people of yamaya to break the
ancient commandment and seek the
flame kuluun charged for many
weeks you have been whispering that-
do not try to deny it

  ibir answered steadily i do not
deny that i am in favorof coming to
terms with the nagas so that we may
breathe of the flame of life and be-
come invulnerable to death why should
ancient superstition prevent us from en-
joying immortality

  there was a low murmur of support-
ing voices from several of the yamayan
nobles in the throne-room ibir it
seemed had a few adherents

  ibir is right muttered one voice
the nagas would let us breathe the
flame if we made peace with them we
could become like gods forever im-
mortal

  terrell saw wrath gather in the eyes
of kuluun it burst into flaming utter-
ance

did not our forefathers adjure us
never to seek the flame lest doom fall
upon us blazed the young king did
they not warn us never to parley with
the evil serpent-men who sought to
lost city of burma



tempt us with the flame

  aye but some of us deem it time we
ended our age-old feud with the nagas
said ibir boldly we cannot kill them
for they are immortal why should we
not make peace with them and become
ourselves immortal

  kuluun flared because we know
from our ancestors tvarning that the
immortality with which the nagas
tempt us is as evil as themselves 

  ibir and his adherents were sullenly
silent terrell who had listened in
wonder found aleck harris plucking
his arm i cant follow it whispered
harris puzzledly  whats it all
about

  terrell explained in a brief whisper
to the englishman and ruth it
seems these yamayans hold the flame
an evil forbidden thing but that fel-
low ibir heads a group who want to
disregard ancient tradition and seek
the flame

tnwardly terrell was himself
mystified by the fierce controversy
between these yamayans these people
talked of the nagas and the flame of
life as though they were real-as
though they had only to breathe the
flame whatever it might be to become
undying and invulnerable but surely
they should know better than to credit
such a wild legend

  kuluuns voice recalled him from
wild speculation the young yamayan
king was looking down harshly at the
prisoners

  if ibirs plot did not bring you into
this land what did he demanded of
terrell

  terrell told the exact truth trusting
that it would best serve his purpose
he pointed accusingly at hirota

  that man who is of the race called
japanese sought to come here and
secure the flame of life so that his

  country might use it as a weapon against
other races we who are his enemies
in war sought to prevent him from
securing it

  it is just the other way around
highness avowed hirota instantly to
the king my soldiers and i pursued
these three men and the white girl be-
cause we knew they intended a sacri-
legious quest for the flame

  you see-they all talk with forked
tongues growled gron disgustedly to
the king probably theyre all after
the cursed flame

  i think so indeed said kuluum
fiercely and the ancient law left
us by our ancestors still holds good-
all who seek the flame of life must
die

  his handsome face set hard you
will take them all and give them death
by the bowstring and let their deaths
be an example to you and your group
ibir

  terrell had for the last few moments
been expecting that death-sentence he
had seen which way things were going
and he had come to a desperate resolve
that at least they would die fighting

  so that as kuluun finished speaking
terrell was already lunging toward the
nearest yamayan guard and snatching
the mans curved sword from his belt
surprise won him the weapon before
the warrior could prevent it

  terrells plan was to leap to the
throne and threaten kuluun with in-
stant death unless he and his comrades
were released but he reckoned with-
out the amazing alertness of the giant
gron for swift as was his spring
toward the throne he found the big
captain blacking his way with drawn
sword

  oh-ho my bantam you have fight
in you have you bellowed gron his
bristling face lighting up well id
rather kill a man with a good clean


fantastic adventures

gron pressed forward with deadly purpose

sword than a bowstring come on
terrell struck furiously but the giant
yamayans big sword easily parried the
inexpert blow he could hear a shout-
ing of the guards behind him as they
seized his fellow-prisoners

  he aimed another fierce clumsy blow
at gron terrell knew that his tenuous
scheme was thwarted and that he
couldnt long stand against grons
swordsmanship but at least hirota
and his mission were doomed and he
was going to die fighting

chapter v
shadow of horror

    ron was already pressing forward
with deadly purpose his bleak
eyes blazing battle-joy as his heavy
sword hammered down terrells blade
then above the clash of steel came an
amazed shout from one of the guards

  this man is of the faith the
guard was exclaiming

  wait then ordered kuluun
gron stay your sword

  reluctantly the giant captain low-
ered his weapon it gave terrell a
chance to turn around and see what
had happened one of the yamayan

guards in seizing yuan chi had ex-
posed a leaf-shaped turquoise amulet
that hung at the chinese officers neck
it was a buddhist symbol

  terrell had forgotten that his chi-
nese companion was a buddhist but
it stood them in good stead now for
yuan chi at once took advantage of it

  yes i am your co-religionist for i
too follow the ninefold path of the
buddha yuan said quickly

  the yamayans all seemed surprised
kuluun asked do your companions
follow the way of truth also

  yuan chi evaded they follow the
faith also in their own way

  terrell himself added quickly is it
not written in the sacred books that
all they who revere the buddha and
his teachings have their feet upon the
path

  his citation produced a marked im-
pression upon the yamayans terrells
hopes were rebounding it was obvious
that these people were fervent bud-
dhists who would not kill those whom
they considered co-religionists

  hirota too had perceived the situa-
tion the resourceful little japanese at
once spoke up

  we of japan all reverence the
buddha and pattern our lives after his
wise commandments the nipponese
lied brazenly

  yuan chis lip curled that is un-
true his people have no other god
than their own emperor

  king kuluun seemed puzzled even
trespassing strangers may not be put to
death if they are of the faith yet it
seems that there is a doubt about some
of you

  he gave his decision we shall de-
fer judgment upon you until these
doubts are resolved in the meantime
you shall remain in my palace as guests
-guarded guests

  terrell understood they were far
lost city of burma



from being out of danger and were to
be prisoners in everything but name

  gron scowled at terrell that in-
terruption saved your neck bantam a
moment more and id have split you
from head to heel

  terrell answered coolly youre
dreaming man i was just about to
give you the death-thrust

  he knew as well as gron how far
that was from the truth but instead of
taking offense the big captain grinned
at terrell

  youve spirit in you bantam
kuluun pointed toward the captured
sub-machine guns and ammunition
lock up those strange weapons gron
we shall examine them later

  the young king added somberly to
terrells group arid the japanese at
tonights banquet i shall talk to you
again

jperrell realized that their fate
hung upon kuluuns coming deci-
sion but he was too grateful for their
temporary reprieve to waste worry at
this moment upon the uncertainties of
the future

  chamberlains who were accompanied
by a file of yamayan guards conducted
the six prisoner-guests out of the
throne-room they passed up broad
stairways into the upper levels of the
palace and into a wing in the western
transept

  the chamberlains either realized the
hostility between terrells party and
the two japanese or else had orders to
keep them separate for they assigned
hirota and his bewildered-looking sol-
dier to one room and conducted ter-
rells group to a suite of two rooms
farther along the corridor

  terrell and his three companions
looked wonderingly around the rooms
they were big cool chambers with
walls of the golden stone upon which

hung brilliant tapestries a few divans
and low uncushioned chairs comprised
the furniture a curtained window
opened upon a little balcony that pro-
jected from the sculptured wall of the
palace

  ruth went to the window exclaiming
with delight as she looked out across
the golden towers of yamaya and the
green jungle beyond

  its all like a beautiful dream the
girl said raptly

  its likely to turn into a nightmare
for us terrell said somberly we
just escaped a hideous death by a hair
you saved our necks by speaking up so
quickly yuan

  yuan chi shrugged you saved
your own by the fact that you could
recite the buddhistic sacred writings
but were walking the edge of a sword-
blade if kulunn decides were en-
emies no talk will save us

  cant we break out of this place
aleck harris wanted to know his blue
eyes keen

  terrell went to the cedarwood door
of their apartment and opened it slight-
ly a half-dozen yamayan soldiers
outside turned instantly toward him
he glimpsed others outside hirotas
door farther down the hall

  not a chance of it he told the
others returning besides i cant
leave this place until im certain that
hirota wont be able to secure the
flame of life

  what is the flame ruth dunn
asked mystified these people all
talk about it as though it had real power
to confer immortality

  just superstition terrell an-
swered though her question had awak-
ened the haunting doubts growing in
his own mind

  that crafty noble ibir didnt look
like a superstitious type to me de-
clared aleck harris yet from what


fantastic adventures

you said he believes utterly in the
flames powers and wants to make a
deal with the nagas for il

  that said yuan chi thoughtfully
is another mystery the nagas
these people talk of the serpent-men
as though they knew them well it ap-
pears part of an ancient unhuman race
has survived here

  terrell felt a chilling sensation as
though he were peering into shadowy
vistas of alien mystery and horror
with an effort he fought down his un-
canny premonitions

  were too tired even to think about
it now he said well learn more
at that banquet tonight in the mean-
time i suggest we get some sleep you
take the other room ruth

 jerrell slept limp with exhaus-
tion though he had dreams in
which the mocking spectacled face of
hirota alternated with half-glimpsed
vaguely hideous shapes to oppress him

  when he awoke the other two men
were already up the day was almost
over the red sun sinking toward the
jungle horizon out in the distance
yamayan workers were returning from
the fields and herdsmen were leisurely
driving their lowing humpbacked cat-
tle toward the city

  aleck harris was rubbing his chin
and ruefully squinting at himself in a
polished metal wall-mirror

  i could do with a shave com-
mented the raf pilot but i dont
suppose theyd give me anything as
lethal as a razor maybe ill grow a
beard like gron

  terrell asked a little anxiously about
their wounds harris injured hand was
apparently healing rapidly but yuan
chis ankle was badly swollen but
the chinese officer made light of it as
he sat puffing his last cigarette

  ruth entered from the other room

they brought me these new clothes
maybe my costume offended yamayan
ideas of feminine attire i feel now like
an oriental princess

  you look like one said terrell ad-
miringly

  the little nurse in torn khaki had
given way to a young beauty slim in a
tight ankle-length yamayan robe of
white silk worked with pale blue flow-
ers a pair of silver-studded sandals
and a silken white mantle over her soft
dark hair completed the costume

  whats going to happen at this ban-
quet she asked anxiously

  nothing i hope terrell answered
soberly kuluun is trying to make up
his mind whether we or the japanese
are lying or both of us a wrong re-
mark might send us to the bowstrings
let me answer the questions

  that wont be hard-i picked up a
little burmese at the base hospital but
not enough to follow all this conversa-
tion ruth said

  im a stranger here myself
grinned aleck harris anyway im
more interested now in food than in
talk im starved

  they had not long to wait as twi-
light cast a velvety grayness over the
golden roofs of yamaya the door of
their apartment was opened a cham-
berlain had come to conduct them to
the banquet

  the banquet-hall of the kings of
yamaya was a long gallery with a
vaulted roof in the eastern transept of
the palace fragrant torches in wall-
sockets cast a soft shifting glow across
the iridescent glass and silver of a very
long table at which king kuluun and
some dozens of his nobles were already
seated

  terrell and his three friends were
given seats at the kings left next to
gron the giant bearded captain who
was already demolishing a roasted fowl
lost city of burma



greeted the american bluffly terrell
grinned answer but the smile faded as
he looked around and met the glitter-
ing spectacled gaze of hirota who sat
beside ibir across the table

  there was little talk as they ate
hungrily but terrell was aware of
kuluuns handsome brooding young
face watching them

 kuluun asked their names ter
rhel repeated the young king ac-
centedly that is a strange name
and it seems that strange new people
have risen in the outer world since the
times of our ancestors

  terrell saw opening for a question
then it has been long since the an-
cestors of you yamayans came into this
land

  long indeed answered kuluun
broodingly my own remote ancestor
was the great anahrwata the buddhist
hero of centuries ago who led the cru-
sade of extermination against the
nagas those serpent-people had long
lived and worked evil in these lands
for they were a prehuman race they
were worshipped by many humans but
at last anahrwata led the buddhists to
destroy them and rooted them out in
all india and burma

  but anahrwata heard of a remnant
of the nagas who still existed on this
remote isolated plateau he sent his
sons army to slay them also but that
army found that the nagas here pos-
sessed the hidden flame of life which
first kindled life upon earth the
nagas here had breathed the flame
thus becoming immortal

  so anahrwatas son unable to de-
stroy the invulnerable serpent-men
here settled down on this plateau to
guard and to watch the nagas and pre-
vent them from ever going forth to the
outer world to work more evil the
men of that army were our ancestors
and built this city of yamaya and

here we have lived ever since keeping
watch and ward upon the nagas

 jerrell asked incredulously
you believe the flame of life can
really confer invulnerable immortality
yet you dont try to attain it have
you no desire to be immortal

  no we do not replied kuluun
sternly our ancestors knew more of
it than we do and they left solemn
warning that a dreadful doom would
fall on us if ever we tried to breathe
the flame we have obeyed that ad-
juration for centuries though now ibir
and others are seeking to defy it
terrell had masked his unbelief as
he listened to the fantastic tale surely
he told himself all this was only super-
stitious legend

 and have the nagas whom you
watch tried to get to the outside world
he asked the young king skeptically

  kuluun shook his head no the
serpent-men never leave their citadel
that citadel of the nagas lies miles
northeast of here in a gloomy valley
deep in the jungle inside that citadel
of the serpent-men is located the flame
of life

  gron uttered a growling comment
i still say that we yamayans ought to
attack their citadel and pull it down
around their ears

  it would be futile to try kuluun
answered heavily even if we bat-
tered our way into the citadel we could
not kill the invulnerable serpent-men
terrell noticed that hirota was talk-
ing in a low urgent voice with ibir
the cunning-eyed yamayan noble
seemed deeply interested in what the
japanese was saying

  aleck harris leaned across ruth to
murmur a warning looks to me as
though our nipponese friend is cooking
up something with that fellow ibir

i dont like it terrell muttered


fantastic adventures

keep an eye on them

  kuluun was speaking to him again
the young yamayan ruler was asking
terrell

  what is the nature of that war in
the outer world of which you spoke
why should it cause you people to come
into this land

  yes tell us about the war pressed
big gron the bearded giant added
chaffingly are all those who fight
as good at swordsmanship as you are
bantam

  it is not fought with swords but
with weapons more terrible terrell
answered soberly

  bah what kind of wtriors are you
if you cant use swords scoffed the
bluff giant who began the struggle
terrell pointed at hirota his peo-
ple began it they seek to bring all
the peoples of the east under their
tyranny

  hirota broke off his low conversation
with ibir to deny that it is not so
we japanese desire only to bring the
blessings of civilization to the less ad-
vanced races

  as you have brought those blessings
to the people of china for the last five
years said yuan chi bitterly

  kuluun continued his keen question-
ing the young king terrell realized
was far from being a fool he seemed
to be sifting much of the truth out of the
opposing statements of the american
and the japanese

  when kuluun finally rose to his feet
as signal that the feast was ended he
looked darkly at the five strangers

  it grows evident to me that each of
your parties came here seeking the
flame to use as a weapon in your outer
war he said ominously

  i have told you that i wish only to
prevent the japanese from securing it
terrell said hastily

  you have both told me many things

-but how much truth you have spoken
i cannot decide kuluun replied im-
placably i shall reserve decision un-
til i meet with the council of nobles
tomorrow

he was conducted back to their
apartment with ruth and harris
and yuan chi terrell gave the girl and
the pilot a brief account of what he had
learned and of kuluuns reservation of
decision

  harris face tightened doesnt
look so good at least itll be the end
of hirotas mission if were all scragged
together

  the japanese is resourceful
warned yuan chi he talked much
with ibir during the feast i tried to
overhear but could not

  if he could get away from here
hed make straight for the flame
terrell said apparently its not so
far from here

  they had reached their prison-suite
which was now lighted by torches as
their silent guards ushered them in-
side terrell looked back and saw
hirota being similarly conducted back
into his own apartment

  yuan chi dropped onto one of the
low chairs a smothered exclamation
of relief coming from his lips as he sat
down

  youve been walking too much on
that ankle ruth said anxiously itll
never heal if you dont give it some
rest	r

  aleck harris keen blue eyes fixed
on terrells strained sober face

  terrell what do you make of it
all i mean what these people say
about the flame of life and the nagas
there must be something in it when
theyre so convinced

  yuan chi spoke quietly from the
chair in which he was nursing his ankle
there is much in it i fear the tra-
lost city of burma



dition of the pre-human nagas the an-
cient evil serpent-people is unshak-
able in asia in this lost land we are
finding verification of that tradition
terrell turned impatiently then
i suppose that you think the flame of
life tradition is true also and that it
can really give men eternal life
yuan chi shrugged it seems log-
ical to me how else would a remnant
of the ancient nagas have survived
had they not won immortality from
such a source

  that chilling doubt flowed back into
terrells mind his thoughts shook to
the impact of wild speculations men
all through the ages had believed in
and quested for a fabled source of su-
pernatural life if it really existed-
he was aroused from that oppressive
speculation by a distant sound alert
at once terrell raised a warning finger
to the others and silently opened the
door into the corridor for a tiny crack

  through that crack he could peer
past the guards outside and see down
the corridor at once he saw ibir
speaking to the yamayan guards out-
side hirotas room after a moment
the soldiers stood aside and admitted
the crafty-faced noble to the japanese
room

  terrell softly closed his own door
and then turned swiftly to the others
ibir just went in hirotas cell that
means he is cooking up something with
that jap

  yuan chis olive face expressed
alarm i dont like that terrell we
know that ibir and his party want to
reach the flame hirota wants to
reach it too if the japanese joins
forces with ibirs party-

  if hirota does that he may be able
to get out of this city and reach the
flame terrell finished for him we
cant let that happen weve got to
find out what theyre plotting together

  i dont see how we can do that
said aleck harris we cant get out
of here or get near hirotas room-
there are guards outside our door and
his too

  terrells lips compressed without
speaking he walked out through the
curtained window onto the little bal-
cony that jutted from the sculptured
wall of the palace

ut there in the darkness the lights
of yamaya spread in a blinking
pattern beyond the royal gardens the
distant jungle was a brooding blackness
under the stars

  terrell glanced keenly along the pal-
ace wall from each suite of rooms
there projected a tiny balcony like the
one on which he stood hirotas would
be the fourth balcony from his own
nearly a hundred feet away his eyes
ran along the sculptured wall between
the balconies

  he came back inside to the others
showing his excitement i think i can
make it to hirotas balcony along the
wall theres a sculptured cornice or
ledge a couple of inches wide if i can
manage it itll give me a chance to
overhear what he and ibir are up to
ruth looked worried dont try it
if you fell or if they discovered you-
i wont fall and they wont dis-
cover me for hirotas curtains are
drawn terrell reassured her

  at least let yuan or me go with
you protested aleck harris

  terrell snorted what are you talk-
ing about itll be all i can do to hang
onto that ledge and i havent got a
wounded hand like yours or a bad
ankle like yuans

  he made his voice authoritative
you three are to remain here no mat-
ter how long im gone remember if
you give cause for any kind of alarm
youll ruin my chances


fantastic adventures

  terrell then went quickly out onto
their balcony the moon had not yet
risen and the lights of the city blinked
in vague starlit obscurity though the
darkness would lessen the risk of dis-
covery it would increase the difficulty
of the traverse along the palace wall
that sculptured ledge on which he re-
lied looked very narrow now

  he swung himself over the balcony
and carefully planted his feet on the
narrow projection flattening his
whole body closely against the stone
wall he edged by imperceptible move-
ments toward the next balcony his
progress was slow and his whole body
ached from the strain of maintaining
the unnatural posture

  terrells heart jumped to his throat
as his foot slipped upon an eroded spot
on the narrow ledge he teetered on
one toe frantically pressing himself
against the wall his breath came in
a great gasp of relief when he regained
his balance then he shuffled pain-
fully on

  in a few moments he had reached
the next balcony he crouched upon
it breathing hard and relaxing his ach-
ing muscles before he went on there
still lay before him two more such
perilous stretches before he would reach
the balcony of hirotas room it was
in all twenty minutes before he reached
it it seemed twenty years to terrell

  hirotas balcony on which he now
stood was in darkness the heavy
curtains at that window had been
drawn and only a slight crack of light
came from between their folds ter-
rell applied his eye to the crack

   he was looking into the torchlit room
and could clearly hear the voices of its
occupants only ibir and hirota were
talking-the stumpy japanese follower
of the latter sat looking anxiously at
his officer

   hirotas spectacles were glittering in

the torchlight as he spoke urgently to
ibir

  you want to reach the flame as
much as i do dont you he was say-
ing to the yamayan noble

  ibirs crafty face showed a consum-
ing eagerness yes i am not fright-
ened by the superstitious warnings of
doom left by our ancestors why should
i let musty traditions keep me from
becoming immortal

 jerrell could see the faint sneer
on hirotas face the jap he
knew was as skeptical of the flames
powers as was he himself but he was
using ibirs belief in those powers to
secure the fetish for himself

  if you feel that way why havent
you tried long ago to reach the flame
of life hirota was asking the yam-
ayan

  i did try ibir exclaimed i went
secretly to the citadel of the nagas
in which the flame is located i asked
the nagas to let me breathe of it and
become immortal like themselves but
they would not let me do so until i
paid a certain price

  hirota looked startled do you
mean that youve actually talked with
the nagas that those serpent-people
are real

  of course the nagas are real ibir
said impatiently they are imperish-
able and have dwelt for centuries in
that dark stronghold from which they
never come forth and for centuries
they have bitterly cherished hate of
anahrwata the great buddhist king
who was kuluuns ancestor and who
long ago destroyed almost all the ser-
pent-race

  that is why the nagas hate kuluun
so intensely ibir continued it is
because he is anahrwatas descendant
and their implacable enemy like all his
ancestors the serpent-men long to see
lost city of burma



kuluun killed and the line of anahr-
wata ended that was the price they
set me they would let me breathe the
flame of life if i would deliver ku-
luun to them 

  terrell listening out on the dark
balcony was as surprised by this as the
japanese seemed to be

  he could hardly yet believe that the
nagas really existed but if they did
if ibir had really plotted with them
against kuluun-

  but how could i make kuluun pris-
oner and deliver him to the nagas
ibir was concluding ive tried to stir
up revolt against him by inciting the
people to covet immortality but ive
gained only a few adherents-nearly
all the warriors and people of yamaya
remain overawed by the ancient warn-
ings against the flame with my hand-
ful of adherents i couldnt hope to
overcome kuluuns guard and take him
away a prisoner

  hirota spoke swiftly you could
seize kuluun and take him to the na-
gas this very night if you accept my
offer of help

  ibir looked doubtfully at the jap-
anese there are only two of you
you and the scant dozen yamayans i
could count on would not be able to
overcome kuluuns palace guard

  we could if we had those two weap-
ons that gron took from us hirota
asserted the swords and spears of
the warriors here would be useless
against our two thunder-weapons
ibirs eyes narrowed thoughtfully
kuluun ordered gron to lock up those
weapons but we might be able to get
them the guards outside this door are
secretly my followers-i arranged to
have them posted here tonight so that
i could visit you with them and my
other followers-

 we could secure the thunder-
weapons cut down the palace guard

with them then seize kuluun and de-
liver him to the nagas hirota fin-
ished

  ibirs eyes flashed then he asked
shrewdly but what do you expect in
reward for your help

  the japanese officer replied quickly
all that i ask is that i be given access
to the flame of life i too wish to be
immortal

  terrell crouched on the balcony
felt growing alarm and dismay he
could see through hirotas scheme now

  the japanese didnt really believe
in the flames powers he was plan-
ning to help ibir reach it and undoubt-
edly was scheming then to double-
cross the yamayan and secure the mys-
terious fetish for japans uses

  the nagas will certainly let you
too breathe the flame if you help me
deliver their hated enemy kuluun to
them ibir was saying to hirota i
accept your bargain well seize the
king this very night 

  good said hirota first you
must get together all your dependable
followers and have horses ready so
that we can get away quickly when
weve seized kuluun when youve
done that well strike to secure my
weapons with which we can easily cut
down the kings guards

  ibir nodded agreement of the rapid
outline come on the palace is
sleeping now

  the yamayan conspirator went to
the corridor-door of the chamber and
hirota and his jap soldier followed
him

  terrells thoughts raced wildly he
instantly perceived that his most ef-
fective course of action was to let ibir
and the japanese go and then give the
alarm forewarned kuluun would
crush the plot before it got started
and hirota and his mission would
perish


fantastic adventures

  the only thing wrong with terrells
plan was that he never got a chance to
carry it out as ibir opened the door
into the corridor the draft that blew
through the room momentarily parted
the curtains behind which terrell was
crouching and hirota wheeling to
leave the room glimpsed the american

  hirota recognized the danger and
acted to avert it with such wonderful
swiftness that terrell had not even a
moment to recast his plans a split-
second after those curtains blew open
to expose him the japanese officer was
lunging back across the room like a
human projectile

  terrell went down with hirotas
hand across his throat choking off his
outcry and with the japs other hand
pressing with devilish ju-jitsu wizardry
upon the nerve-centers at the back of
his neck he flailed arms that sud-
denly seemed leaden and strengthless
trying to break that grip his brain
was roaring he only dimly heard
hirotas low cry

  quick your dagger the japanese
was hissing to the yamayan noble who
stood stupefied

  terrell struggling frantically
glimpsed ibir running forward the
yamayans face was muddy-yellow
with alarm and his dagger was raised

  the american rolled convulsively to
evade that blade as it stabbed toward
his back he felt the burning bite of
the steel along his armpit his lungs
seemed bursting from hirotas stran-
gling grip

  desperation spurred him to a su-
preme effort to break his enemys
deadly clutch he felt himself succeed-
ing felt his hands tearing hirotas fin-
gers away-

  then terrell glimpsed the other jap
running forward the mans saffron
face was contorted as he raised a small
metal stool for a smashing blow ter-

rell tried to duck and couldnt the
stool crashed down on his skull

chapter vi

citadel of the nagas

cctohn john terrell

  j it seemed to terrell that that
frantic voice was calling to him from
an infinite distance away through
leagues of formless haze in which he
had been floating for ages

  john please try to wake

  the agonized appeal in that sobbing
voice triggered consciousness in ter-
rells dazed brain he was aware first
of pain-red tides of it that flowed
rhythmically from his head down
through his body

  he opened his eyes and tried drunk-
enly to focus his vision the white blur
poised above him resolved itself into
the pale agonized face of ruth dunn
her brown eyes were wet with tears

  i thought you were dead she
sobbed ive been working here band-
aging you and giving you first aid
but you showed no sign of waking
her firm little arm around terrells
shoulder helped him to sit up but the
movement made the red pain-tides
pulse faster through his head

  ruth how did you get here he
muttered dazedly

  i came along the ledge between bal-
conies the same way you did ruth
confessed i had to do it wed
waited almost two hours and you hadnt
come back i knew neither yuan nor
aleck could make it along the ledge
with their injuries so i slipped out
when they werent looking

  terrell looked wildly around the
torchlit chamber had no occupants but
the girl and himself that hours had
indeed elapsed was evidenced by the
faint gray light of dawn that showed
lost city of burma



outside the window

 remembrance came back to his ach-
ing brain in a rush he struggled to
get to his feet

  hirota and his jap and ibir-gone
hours agol he exclaimed hoarsely
they must have thought they had
killed me-

  i thought so too when i first saw
you ruth said quiveringly your
head looked crushed and that slight
stab in your back had bled so badly
ruth you dont understand cried
terrell hirota and ibir went to carry
out a plot against kuluun weve got
to warn the king

  what was that ruth exclaimed
suddenly

  terrell had heard it too a distant
raging yell that echoed from the lower
levels of the palace it was succeeded
by a chorus of shouts and then came
a staccato sound that cut brutally
across them

  bam-bam-bam-bam-

  were too late terrell cried
the japs have got their guns back
trumpets were blaring alarm
through the palace there were fierce
shouts and the rush of running feet
below

  terrell and ruth ran out into the
corridor the guards who had been
stationed there were gone now they
met aleck harris and yuan chi emerg-
ing from the other rooms

  terrell youre hurt exclaimed
aleck harris then as the staccato
rattle of the sub-machine guns came
again good god whats happening
ibirs leading an attempt to seize
kuluun and that devil hirota is help-
ing him terrell answered hoarsely
weve got to help stop it come on 
ruth started to follow them as he
and harris and the limping yuan chi
started down the corridor but terrell
thrust her hastily back

  stay here ruth theres fighting
going on down there

  but im not afraid- she protested

  he was already stumbling down the
stairs aleck harris ran beside him
and the chinese officer hobbled hastily
in their wake

an appalling scene met their eyes
as they lunged down the steps to
the round central hall in which the two
main corridors intersected ibir and a
half-dozen other armed yamayans
were hurrying away dragging with
them the senseless form of kuluun
the young king was bleeding from a
wound on the forehead

  kuluuns guards lay scattered about
the corridors in dead heaps the last
handful of guards remaining was des-
perately charging forward with up-
raised swords to rescue their ruler
but hirota and his jap soldier cover-
ing the escape of ibirs group were
using the sub-machine guns

  the spray of bullets cut down those
charging guards before they could get
close enough to use their swords ter-
rell yelled his rage as he threw himself
on down the steps toward the japs
hirota saw him coming and the star-
tled jap officer swung his deadly weap-
on up toward him

  terrell look out shouted aleck
harris as he voiced that warning
the young english pilot shoved the
american violently aside

 bam-bam-bam-

  the burst from hirotas gun caught
harris before he could get out of the
line of fire he crumpled forward on
the steps

  terrell leaped furiously across the
fallen pilot charging on down the stairs
but hirota and his jap had swiftly re-
treated after ibir and the others for
now the whole palace was waking to
the uproar


fantastic adventures

  snatching up a sword the american
staggered down the corridor after them
before he reached the entrance of the
palace by which they had left the drum
of horses hooves reached his ears

  he burst out into the gray mists of
dawn to see ibir and the two japanese
and their half-dozen yamayan follow-
ers riding off at full gallop through the
slumbering city and kuluuns uncon-
scious figure lay across ibirs saddle-
bow

  gron yelled terrell hoarsely
turning and running back into the pal-
ace gron where are you

  then he saw the giant bearded cap-
tain his massive face distorted with
anger and his great sword in his hand
running toward him at the head of a
mass of yamayan warriors the alarm
of uproar had brought them

  whats happened here roared the
giant wheres the king if you
strangers have murdered him-

  terrell was too numb with shock of
horror and dismay to fear the upraised
sword with which the raging giant men-
aced him

  ibir and his men have seized ku-
luun and are on their way to deliver
him over to the nagas  he cried ibir
plotted it with the japanese and they
stole those weapons of theirs and used
them the nagas arfe to let ibir breathe
the flame for delivering the king to
them

  grons bearded face became terrible
in its white rage hell destroy that
traitor the nagas would pay any
price to get their hands on kuluun 
are you going to stand here groan-
ing about it or are we going after
them shouted terrell

 well go after them cried the
raging giant we may not be able to
overtake them before they reach the
citadel of the nagas but by buddha
well smash our way into that devils

castle before we let them kill the king
gron began shouting orders to his
officers gather every horseman and
war-elephant rouse the city 

  terrell was running back along the
corridor to the stairs there yuan chi
and ruth were bending over aleck har-
ris limp body

  the girl looked up her eyes glim-
mering hes dead

  he died pushing me out of the way
of hirotas bullets choked terrell
that murdering jap owes me now for
both aleck and sigri

 jprumpets were sounding stri-
dently inside and outside the pal-
ace they could hear distant cries
clank of armored men running up gal-
lop of arriving horses and the heavy
hasty tread of elephants

  terrell and yuan chi carried har-
ris body into a nearby chamber laying
it upon a couch and reverently cov-
ering the dead pilots face they hur-
ried out then to the palace entrance

  the sun was rising and the golden
city yamaya had become a vast hive
of excitement a score of great war-
elephants a half-hundred horsemen
and several hundred yamayan footmen
had gathered here

  you ride with us cried gron as
terrell and the chinese appeared
good if we had believed what you
told us about that lying japanese this
never would have happened

  ive my own account to settle with
hirota terrell replied as he mounted
one of the waiting horses then he ex-
claimed with sudden anxiety ruth
no you cant

  the girl who had changed back into
her soiled khaki uniform was mounting
one of the yamayan ponies beside him-
self and yuan chi

  i wont stay here she cried im
going where you go john
lost city of burma



  it was a confession of love as clear
as the admission in her strained brown
eyes terrells heart pounded with the
mingled emotions of wild incredulous
joy and overpowering anxiety

 but ruth-

  it was too late for remonstrance
gron had vaulted onto his big stallion
and was shouting thunderously to his
followers

  yamayans we ride to rescue our
king from the nagas it is said that
the serpent-men are deathless today
we shall prove or disprove that for-
ever with our swords

  a wild yell answered him from hun-
dreds of throats and they were im-
mediately all sweeping forward after
gron as the giant leader spurred his
stallion

  terrell swept along with yuan chi
and ruth by the fierce galloping horse-
men could only shout fearfully to the
girl

  ruth for gods sake stay close to
me and keep out of danger

  thunder of hundreds of hoofs clat-
tering fast upon the cobbled streets of
yamaya drowned out his appeal they
were riding out through the open gates
with the war-elephants and the footmen
following them closely the red glare
of the rising sun painted their faces
luridly

  grons black stallion led the way
across the fields toward the jungle
the giant captains bellowed orders
strung them out into a long file in which
they galloped into a jungle trail lead-
ing northeast

  terrells crazy thoughts kept time
with the hammer of his ponys hoofs
along that dim narrow trail he was
keyed to unbearable tension

  this is the showdown yuan he
called to the chinese riding behind
himself and ruth if we dont get
hirota now if he gets to the flame of

life and escapes with it-

  john what are the nagas whose
citadel were riding to ruth cried to
him they cant really be what the
yamayans say

  no thats impossible terrell de-
nied thats simply superstitious
legend about an enemy people

  desperately he repeated that assur-
ance to himself to quell that premoni-
tion of shadowy horror that kept rising
in his mind the belief that the nagas
were the serpent-folk of ancient legend
could have no real basis kulunn had
said that the nagas never came forth
from their citadel and that mystery
had somehow engendered horrifying
traditions

  whatever the nagas were the flame
of life was somewhere in their strong-
hold and that mysterious and evil
fetish to which such impossibly mi-
raculous powers were ascribed was the
final focus of his deadly struggle with
hirota if the wily japanese secured
it and escaped with it-

  terrells agony of apprehensions
made the ride through the jungle seem
many hours long yet it was actually
little more than two hours of galloping
along the dim jungle trails before gron
drew rein

  down in that gorge is the citadel
of the nagas bellowed the giant cap-
tain and look there go the traitors
we pursue

  a yell of rage burst from all the
mounted yamayans as they saw

  hey had reached the lip of a gorge
many miles long but only a half-
mile wide the floor of that gloomy
chasm wound downward from where
they sat their horses to depths in which
reigned perpetual dusk

  far far down on the distant floor
of the dark gash in the rock there
loomed a somber and ancient black


fantastic adventures

castle of hexagonal shape toward it
through the twilight rode the party of
ibir and hirota

  that citadel gasped ruth her
face pale it looks as old as evil

  aye it is the stronghold of evil it-
self hissed yuan chi his slant eyes
blazing the last refuge of the daevas
or demons who once oppressed all
earth

  forward gron was roaring we
may still cut them off before they enter
the citadel

  they galloped pell-mell down the
rocky slope into the gorge terrell
clinging desperately to his mount and
glancing anxiously at ruth

  it was like riding down out of day-
light into a somber dusk that became
deeper and chillier as they went lower
no trees or grass grew upon the dark
barren floor of this chasm no life was
visible except the bats flitting through
the unnatural twilight

  grons drawn sword glittered through
the obscurity as the giant yamayan
led their rush forward along the floor
of the chasm his raging voice floated
back to them on the wind

  faster theyre entering the cit-
adel

  terrell felt the hair bristling on his
neck as he descried at this close dis-
tance the mysterious and dreaded
stronghold ahead

  the citadel of the nagas loomed as
immeasurably ancient in appearance as
though built in the dawn of time its
vast hexagonal bulk was of massive
black stones crumbling from the ero-
sion of countless ages

  there was but one entrance in the
high stone wall of the citadel that
portal was set between the outreaching
paws of a gigantic devil-faced stone
sphinx whose colossal face glared from
directly above the gates

  those massive metal gates were

closing ibir and the japanese with
their followers and the captive ku-
luun had been admitted by the nagas

  too late cried gron furiously
theyve closed the gates but well
batter them open 

  he spurred his horse around and
sent his stentorian yell ringing back
along the gorge to the elephants and
foot-soldiers who followed

  bring up the elephants quickly
terrell was unnerved by the somber
silence of the citadel as contrasted to
the raging horde of yamayans outside
its gates not an arrow not a spear
came from the castles walls no one
showed upon them

  he fiercely fought down that chill of
doubt with a cautioning word to ruth
to stay back he and yuan chi spurred
forward with gron as four ponderous
elephants came rushing toward the
metal gates of the citadel

  the great beasts lowered their heads
and braced their mighty legs they
thrust with all the power of their huge
muscles there was a snapping crash-
and the gates of the citadel burst in-
ward

 come on bellowed gron ex-
ultantly spurring forward kill ibir
and find the king

  terrell too was yelling as with sword
in hand he and yuan chi and the other
horsemen galloped in through the open
gate the yamayan footmen were
rushing after them

  then it happened a cataract of
fire rained suddenly down across the
portal blazing oil or chemicals were
being released from the open grinning
jaws of the devil-faced sphinx above
the gates

  hells trick of the nagas raged
gron theyve trapped us

rjhey were caught inside the fire-
closed portals-he and terrell and
lost city of burma

yuan chi and a dozen other horsemen
and among them terrell saw ruth

  he spurred toward the girl who had
followed despite his warning screams
were coming from outside from yama-
yan warriors caught by the hissing
flood of fire from above the forces
outside were retreating from the gate

  the nagas screamed a yamayan
beside terrell

  terrells heart skipped a beat as he
saw the creatures who had sprung out
of the walls around them to attack
them

 the nagas were not human but
at first glance they seemed of human
size and shape they were a horrible
ophidian caricature of mankind their
grayish-green bodies seemed as supple
and boneless as a snakes their legs
and arms seeming more like tentacles
than limbs

  their heads were hideously snake-
like blunted browless the only fea-
tures of the ghastly faces were the
wide white-lipped mouth and lidless
eyes most alien feature of all the
bodies of these weird serpent-men
shone with a faint iridescent luminos-
ity

  god theyre real-the nagas of
legend are real husked terrell as he
won to ruths side then the flame
of life too-

  cut through the fiends gron was
bellowing undauntedly find the
king 

  the hideous nagas were not attack-
ing with swords or spears they were
flinging uncoiling nooses that caught
and wrapped around the yamayans as
though themselves alive

  terrell recovered from his stupefac-
tion of horror as one of the ghastly
creatures raced toward himself and
ruth he spurred his terrified horse
forward and sent his sword stabbing
through the nagas breast

   he ripped the blade out again but
 the naga did not fall the serpent-
 man merely stood for a moment as
 though momentarily stopped by the
 shock and in that moment terrells
 unbelieving eyes saw that terrible
 wound upon the nagas breast closing
 healing instantaneously

   the serpent-man was whirling his
 strange noose-like weapon to terrell
 came the awful final realization that
 these creatures were indeed indestruct-
 ible

chapter vii

the flame of life

 jazed by the nightmare reality of
 the nagas terrell was for the
 moment drained of all initiative and
 purpose he was as though paralyzed
 by the numbing shock of discovery
 that the serpent-men of ancient tradi-
 tion existed and that they were indeed
 invulnerably immortal

   ruths sharp scream of horror
 roused him one of the curious nooses
 of the nagas had flown unerringly
 through the air and struck the girl
 instantly with that weird pseudo-life
 that made the weapons so ghastly the
 noose had coiled itself tightly around
 her

   terrell spurred frantically toward
 her he was too late his momentary
 paralysis had sealed his own fate the
 naga whom he had stabbed without
 effect was flinging his own noose the
 thin black rope-like thing struck ter-
 rells chest and instantly tightened
  around him the weapon appeared to
 be a thing cunningly designed of or-
 ganic perhaps even semi-living matter
 whatever object it touched was in-
 stantly and tightly held

    its constriction was so swift that ter-
 rell had no chance to escape it his


fantastic adventures

arms were pinioned to his body as
though by a cable of steel his horse
was plunging frantically nagas were
reaching up to pull him and ruth from
the saddles

  john screamed the girl in frantic
revulsion from the touch of the nagas

  he strained convulsively to free him-
self-and couldnt he tried to call
encouragement to her but his throat
was dry and tight

  they were captives they all were
captives-all of them who had been
trapped inside the citadel by the fiery
curtain gron and yuan chi and a
half-dozen others of the yamayans

  devils from hell gron was roar-
ing like a trapped bear trying in vain
to break the nooses now binding him
spawn of evil-

  yuan chis clear voice reached
through the tumult terrell they got
you too its all up with us i fear
the yamayans outside retreated in ter-
ror when the fire fell

  yes it was all up terrell knew it
with an icy certainty that was like dull
agony in his horror-fogged mind the
attackers outside had fled in an excess
of superstitious terror there was no
hope from there

  yet it still seemed like a bad dream
lying bound and helpless on the pave-
ment beside ruth he saw the nagas
about them as one might see demoniac
creatures in a medieval vision of hell
the resemblance was heightened by the
weird iridescence with which the na-
gas bodies glowed

  what caused that iridescent luminos-
ity of their bodies and what caused
the shimmering haze of faint light or
force that seemed to pervade every-
thing inside the citadel he could
feel that haze as a tingling tangible vi-
bration through his flesh as he lay
there

  the nagas jerked the captives onto

their feet though the arms of all were
pinioned by living nooses their legs
were unfettered one of the hideous
serpent-men pointed and spoke to the
prisoners

  you will come with us before the
most ancient to answer for your crime
of attacking this place said the crea-
ture

  the voice was a sibilant hissing one
that issued between wide white lips that
gave ghastly glimpses of the creatures
forked tongue

  but the words were in the ancient
burmese language spoken by the ya-
mayans these creatures were intelli-
gent despite their being inhuman

  theyre mutants yuan chi was
speaking hoarsely as they were herded
across this open courtyard of the cita-
del terrell this is a mutant race that
forked off the main human tree far
back in the past an evolutionary
freak of a species thats been long ex-
tinct everywhere but in this lost corner
of earth-

  yuan they cant be killed ter-
rells voice was husky with the horror
of that knowledge i stabbed one
through the breast and the wound
closed before my eyes the creature
was unhurt

  i saw said the chinese officer
its incredible yet not outside the
bounds of scientific possibility their
bodies must possess an unearthly power
of regeneration

egeneration terrells dazed
mind seized upon that hint of ex-
planation which illumined many things

  for regeneration was the biological
name for that ability of a living crea-
ture to heal and restore wounded parts
of its body some forms of life pos-
sessed it in much greater degree than
others a lizard could regenerate a
lost limb an insect of some species a
lost city of burma



whole lost organ a man could regen-
erate a lost bit of skin or bone but little
more the degree of the power de-
pended on the chemical activity of the
living cells

 but suppose a deep and radical
change was worked in the chemical con-
situation and activity of the cells a
change that caused a heightening of
the regenerative power to the last de-
gree of completeness and swiftness
then a group of damaged cells could
almost instantly regenerate themselves

  living creatures died because a vital
organ was damaged by accident or dis-
ease but if their cells possessed the
power to regenerate instantaneously
that damaged organ or tissues would in-
stantly renew itself death would be
impossible

  but how was it done husked ter-
rell how were their bodily cells so
deeply altered as to confer that power
if the flame of life-

  he stopped appalled if the flame
of life conferred that power of super-
regeneration then the potency of the
flame to bestow immortality is real
the ancient traditions are true

  yuan chis face was quivering and
if the flame really has that power and
that devil hirota gains access to it-
the reminder illumined ghastly pos-
sibilities in terrells brain but there
was no time to brood upon them the
nagas were pushing them on

  the prisoners were being herded
across that court toward the square
high open entrance of the main struc-
ture of the black citadel out of that
open portal the luminous iridescent
haze or force beat strongly upon them
ruth dunns white face was that of a
sleepwalker

  terrell felt that same shrinking hor-
ror as they went up the few steps into
the portal only gron in whom the
hideous nature of the nagas entailed no

violence to preconceived ideas contin-
ued to voice his fury

  theres that traitor ibir he raged
as they passed through the portal if
i could get my arms loose-

  hirota hissed yuan chi in ac-
cents of undying hatred

  terrell saw neither of them his
vision was too transfixed by the awe-
some spectacle that lay before him in
the vast room they had entered

  for the room was vast and terrible
it was the main hall of the citadel a
gigantic hexagonal chamber whose
stone walls had no windows round its
sides were gathering scores of the hide-
ous nagas coming from all parts of the
labyrinthine castle

  near them at the side of the hall
ibir and his fellow-traitors from ya-
maya stood with the bound captive
kuluun hirota was with them and
a little beyond them against the stone
wall was a stone throne carved in re-
pulsive patterns upon it sat a single
one of the nagas

  all this was around the edge of the
hexagonal hall but at its center was
that which dwarfed everything else here
to insignificance in the stone floor
yawned a round pit or well a hundred
feet across it dropped to incalculable
depths and up out of that pit there
gushed-

  the flame of life ruth dunns
voice was a dry whisper from beside
terrell

  good god he heard his own voice
babbling that thing-

jt was the flame of life it could
be nothing else he knew that
awful radiance of cold white flame that
burst up from the depths of the pit like
a fountain of freezing fire was too un-
earthly to be aught else

  it was quite silent and that added
to the alien terror of it a soundless and


fantastic adventures

awful geyser of heatless flame it never
for a moment ceased gushing up out of
the opening and from its raging bril-
liance there came that tingle of vibrant
force which he felt here much more
strongly

  terrell began to understand this
was radioactivity not fire that burst-
ing geyser of blazing force was a tor-
rent of radiation streaming up from
unguessable radioactive deposits deep
down beneath this citadel radiation
that could alter the chemical nature of
living cells deeply and irrevocably to
give them that power of super-regener-
ation-

  bring the prisoners and the others
before me it was the hissing voice
of the enthroned naga who had been
called the most ancient

  the captives were herded stumbling-
ly toward the throne ibir and hirota
walked ahead of them the faces of both
men avid with unholy eagerness as they
looked toward the bursting flame

  its all a dream ruth was saying
pitifully to terrell ill wake up back
at the base hospital

  agonized apprehension for her cut
through everything else in his seething
mind ruth ill get you out of here
somehow-i will

  but they were standing in front of
that stone throne and the lidless eyes
of the unhuman creature upon it were
looking down at them those alien orbs
fixed upon kuluuns hard defiant face

  so at last murmured the sibilant
voice of the most ancient we have in
our power to end the line of the cursed
anahrwata who long ago stamped out
our race we have waited very long for
this day

  the young king did not waver you
only gained this victory by treachery
spawn of evil

  his flaming glance fell upon ibir and
the japanese ibir recoiled a little from

the bitter accusation in that look

  but hirota did not the japanese
stepped boldly forward to address the
unhuman creature on the throne

  most ancient of nagas it was my
plan that delivered kuluun into your
hands he declared for reward i
was promised a chance to breathe of the
flame of life

  the dreadful lidless eyes rested on
the japanese you wish then to be-
come immortal like us nagas asked
the hissing voice

  it seemed to terrell that there was
an ironic something in the sibilant ques-
tion a veiled quality but hirota if he
sensed it ignored it

  yes i wish to become invulnerably
immortal as you are he exclaimed
i have merited this reward from you
will you give it to me and let me re-
turn then to my own people

  terrell divined the appalling nature
of hirotas intentions until recently
he knew the japanese had no more
than himself believed in the powers
of the flame but now he knew those
powers to be true

  and knowing that the flame could
confer invulnerability hirota was
scheming to use the flame for japan
he would come back with hosts of his
countrymen so that they too might
become as he

  dreadful vision of a world in which
embattled democracies strove in vain
against a nipponese horde which could
not be killed flashed through terrells
brain it could happen if hirota suc-
ceeded-

  you have merited the reward you
ask the most ancient was hissing to
hirota you shall breathe invulner-
ability from the flame and then we
will permit you to go from here
and i too panted ibir eagerly
you promised that i too should be
allowed to breathe the flame if i
lost city of burma



brought you kuluun

  you too assured the sibilant voice
of the naga you both shall attain
immortality like ours and then may go
yes you may go as far away from our
citadel as you wish

 gain terrells overstrained mind
seemed to catch a quality of
amusement in the nagas voice and
look but he had no time to speculate
upon it for he was raising his voice
in frantic protest

  no dont do that terrell cried
to the naga ruler you dont know
what youre doing if you let this
japanese become deathless and then go
away hell be back with armies of his
countrymen

  it is not so  rapped hirota harshly
once i have gone i will not come
back

  the naga ruler answered terrells
frantic warning imperturbably my
word has been spoken the man shall
gain the immortality he seeks and then
shall go from here if he wishes to
return that is his own affair

  the creature pointed a tentacular
arm toward the raging geyser of radi-
ance terrell perceived for the first
time that a sender metal girder spanned
the pit from which gushed the flame
that spidery pathway was no more than
a foot wide and was almost constantly
hidden from view by the torrent of blaz-
ing radiation

  step out into the flame and stand
within it until its power causes your
body to change and glow the naga
was directing hirota then you will
be as we are

  hirota moved toward the pit he
hesitated before setting foot upon that
precarious metal pathway

  terrell could well understand his
hesitation it seemed suicidal to walk
out into the full blaze of that awful

geyser of cold fire but after a mo-
mentary pause the japanese stepped
boldly out

  by buddha he has courage mut-
tered yuan chi watching with the same
tension that held them all

  hirota was walking into the terrific
rush of the flame the geyser of up-
bursting radiation veiled the japs
stocky figure from view

  terrell could see him only in vague
glimpses standing out there at the very
center of that giddy span over the
awful pit it seemed to him that hirota
was shuddering and reeling beneath the
impact of the radiation

  minutes passed seeming like eter-
nities had hirota staggered into the
pit no-now they saw that the jap-
anese was returning

  but hirota was changed his face
and hands his whole body glowed now
with the same iridescent luminosity as
did the nagas and his glowing face
was transfigured with triumph as he
came back to them

  i have done it unholy exultation
throbbed in his harsh cry i felt my
body change-i can feel burning new
life throbbing in me

  it is the new life kindled in you
by the flame a life akin to the force of
the flame itself said the most an-
cients hissing voice

  terrel dimly understood the jap-
anese body had been transformed by
the phenomenon of induced radioactiv-
ity every cell had been made at least
partly radioactive in nature by that im-
pact of awful radiation

  hirota flung his arms out as though
drinking in the tingling force of the
bursting fame that throbbed and shim-
mered through the citadel

   i can feel the radiation of the flame
now in every fiber of me he exulted
new life new strength-and now i
cannot ever die


fantastic adventures

  a sudden doubt checked his exulta-
tion or can i did it affect me as
it affected you nagas ill soon find
out 

  and hirota snatched out his dagger
and plunged its blade through his own
arm

  the horrified watchers saw blood
spurt from his wound only for a frac-
tion of a second then that swiftly
the wound closed and healed like magic

  i am immortal hirotas cry was
one of supreme victory and when
the leaders of japan-

  he checked what he had been about
to exclaim he looked up at the naga
rulers inscrutable ophidian face

  i am free to go-now he asked
swiftly you promised that i should
be allowed to go

  the most ancient waved toward the
open portals of the great hall you
are free to go as far as you wish to go

  again that ironic amusement in the
sibilant voice and with it a stir of
something like hideous mirth among
the nagas in the hall

tut hirota drunk with his triumph
was beyond noticing with a final
triumphant glance at terrells horror-
stricken face the japanese strode out
through the open portals

  terrell watched frozenly as the
weirdly luminous hirota walked out
across the courtyard the great gates
in the wall of the citadel were still
open and the wall of fire that had cur-
tained them was now cut off

  hirota was walking out through those
gates the japanese was on his way
to take word to the hordes of japan
of a weapon that could make them in-
vulnerable and unconquerable terrell
saw catastrophe to the world he knew
walking out there in the form of the re-
ceding hirota

  and there was nothing to stop it

the yamayan attackers had fled and
no obstacle lay between the japanese
and his dreadful purpose

  but why then was hirota stopping
just out there beyond the gates why
was he staggering writhing as though
in torment

  somethings wrong with him
breathed yuan chi prayerfully some-
thing terrible-

  hirota was running wildly back into
the citadel as though to escape an
agony too great for endurance

  and the nagas were laughing they
were laughing as though the point of an
expected joke had been reached whose
hellish humor they tasted with exquisite
pleasure

  hirotas luminous face was contorted
awfully and he was screaming as he
ran back into the hexagonal hall

 what happened to me he
screamed as soon as i left the ci-
tadel every bit of my body began to
burn each step i took made it worse
-i couldnt bear it i had to come
back-

  the sibilant voice of the most an-
cient was a bland mockery it is
something which we did not tell you
about the flame of life those who
breathe of it and let it kindle its own
immortal force within their fibers can-
not die but forever after they must
remain close to the flame so that their
changed bodies may constantly drink
its force they must feed upon the
radiance of it or else suffer torment

  hirotas face was awful as he heard
and understood and terrell too felt
the icy shock of that ghastly revelation

  dimly terrell sensed the immutable
scientific laws that lay behind the dread-
ful naga jest hirotas body had been
kindled into weird radioactive life by
the flame but the phenomenon of
induced radioactivity that had irrevo-
cably transformed his living cells must
lost city of burma



be constantly renewed by the tingling
radiation of the great source if it
were not his cells would slowly feed
upon their own atoms an endless fiery
torment

  do you mean that i can never
leave the flame of lifes vicinity
screeched the maddened japanese
that i must remain in this citadel
aye you must remain here until
time ends as we have remained came
the nagas merciless rejoinder long
ages ago we breathed of the flame
without knowing that henceforth we
would be chained to it and that is why
we had to build this castle around it
and dwell here ever since we cannot
die we cannot even kill ourselves-
and we can never leave here

  the serpent-man added with that
bitter irony but we have kept our
promise to you you are immortal and
you are free to go-if you wish

  and again that hissing laughter broke
from all the nagas in the great hall a
sibilant mirth like that of fiends in hell

jljirota went mad the japanese
raged and screamed insanely
shaking his fists at the nagas and at
the flame

  terrell was choking hell never
leave here the japanese will never
use this as a weapon not matter what
happens to us-

  now we know why our ancestors
warned of the evil doom that fell upon
those who sought the flame kuluun
exclaimed hoarsely

  terrell heard ibir whimpering the
yamayan traitor was ghastly pale with
horror and fear as he stared with bulg-
ing eyes at the mad hirota and sight
of him triggered a faint hope in ter-
rells mind

  ibir he whispered to the stricken
traitor theyll make you one of them
youll remain in this place forever

   no no gasped ibir id rather
 die i never dreamed-

   theres still a chance to escape if
 you cut us loose terrell said swiftly
 your only chance

   the naga horde had all its attention
 bent upon the insanely raging hirota
 they were still filling the great hall
 with their hissing laughter as the crazed
 japanese raved

   ibir hope flickering across his livid
 face at terrells words slipped behind
 the row of captives terrell felt the
 traitors dagger slicing through the
 pseudo-living ropes coiled around his
 body

   those ropes curled and writhed when
 cut as though indeed living but his
 arms fell free of them and yuan chi
 and ruth with gron and kuluun and
 the others were being freed also

   grab swords and make for the door
 when i give the word terrell whis-
 pered hoarsely along the line

   we cant kill them  yuan chi mut-
 tered frantically no weapon can kill
 them

   if we can keep them off until we get
 outside the citadel were safe ter-
 rell flashed they cant follow

   hirota had flung himself forward to
 attack the most ancient the serpent-
 man upon the throne flung back the in-
 sane japanese with a thrust

   the hissing mirth of the watching
  nagas rose to a new pitch and ter-
 rell seized the opportunty of that mo-
 ment

   now he yelled

   with the shout terrell snatched
 ibirs sword from the traitors belt and
 lunged with ruth toward the portals
 of the great hall yuan chi had grabbed
 the sword of another of the yamayan
 traitors and he and kuluun and gron
 sprang forward at the same moment

   it was like an explosion of sudden
 action in which everything in the vast


fantastic adventures

hall seemed to spin around the central
flame they were at the door the
nagas leaping with superhuman swift-
ness to overtake them

  but the crazily raging hirota was
in the way of the serpent-men by the
time they had swept the maddened
japanese out of the way the moment
had given terrell and the others time
to plunge out into the courtyard they
staggered across it toward the gigantic
open gates of the citadel

  a flying naga noose wrapped around
ruths ankles and tripped her as they
were running between the great gates

  go on she cried to terrell

lie did not even answer that plea

    he stopped and stooped frantic-
ally to pick her up knowing that the
nagas would be on them the next mo-
ment

  but the nagas were being held back
yuan chi had turned and was wielding
his sword like a madman his blade
was slashing the serpent-men and the
nooses with which they sought to trap
him the wounds he gave the nagas
could not harm them but he was block-
ing their pursuit for the moment

  yuan yelled terrell he had cut
the noose around ruths ankles and
now he thrust her on through the gate
and turned to go back to yuan chi

  it was too late the furious ser-
pent-men had now used other weapons
than the nooses yuan chi was falling
with three spears in his heart

  gron and kuluun had turned like
terrell to race back to the aid of the
heroic chinese but now the giant cap-
tain thrust the staggering american on
through the portals

  we cant help him now out be-
fore they have us i yelled gron

  they flung themselves through that
giant gate over which the devil-faced
sphinx grinned malignly they stum-

bled away from the citadel

  the nagas followed through the
gate but only for a few yards then
the serpent-men stopped brought to
a halt by their own agony at leaving
the limits of the flames radiation they
retreated back to their prison-castle
with cries of pain and rage

  terrell and his group stumbled on
along the floor of the gloomy gorge
their strength was near the vanishing
point but they would not remain near
the citadel of the nagas while they
had strength left to crawl

  not until they reached the crest of
the gorge did they pause they looked
back down into the dreadful valley v
the great gates of the black somber
castle had been closed the citadel
hid its hideous mystery as it had done
for ages

  terrell looked at gron and asked a
question ibir

  he didnt get out grunted the big
captain nor did his fellow-traitors
i could almost feel sorry for them
ruths eyes were wet as she looked
back down into the dusky valley yuan
chi-

  yuan died a hero muttered ter-
rell somehow i dont think that a
nation which breeds fighting-men like
that can ever be conquered

  they did not mention hirota none
of them wanted to think of the japa-
nese doomed to dwell for ghastly ages
in that somber castle of horror pris-
oned irrevocably by the immortality
he had coveted

  i think terrell said slowly that
we will say nothing to the outer world
of the flame of life and those who
haunt it it is better if none ever come
again to seek it

  kuluun nodded solemnly so my
ancestors warned today we have seen
their warning of doom fulfilled

  gron found grazing ponies left by
lost city of burma



the yamayans whose attack on the
citadel had been routed they mounted
and rode back westward along the jun-
gle trails

  the sun sank toward the horizon red
and big soon they could see the dis-
tant golden towers of yamaya standing

out brilliant against the descending orb

  beyond yamaya terrell knew lay
the trackless jungles that he and ruth
must cross to reach china and return
to their part in a world at war but
neither of them feared that journey
they would make it together

making the u s self-sufficient

the u s bureau of mines has perfected
a process whereby manganese can be ex-
tracted from low grade ores in large
enough quantities to make this country self-suf-
ficient

  manganese is an absolute necessity in the pro-
duction of high-grade steels and is therefore of
utmost importance to u s industry

  it seemed inconsistent that although we pos-
sessed huge deposits of magnesium ore the u s
was forced to import over  per cent of its needs
but the apparent mystery is solved when one
firfds out that until the tj s bureau of mines
had perfected their new method it was only pos-

sible to obtain magnesium from ore that con-
tained over  per cent of the metal the u s
ore was mostly low-magnesium content ore

  the new method involves the use of an agent
called dlt- which separates most of the
worthless material from the ore and the remainder
is of sufficiently high magnesium content to be
put through the old extraction processes

  plants some of which are already finished and
in operation are being built in nevada according
to the engineers of the bureau of mines the
las vegas area itself contains almost a million
tons of the ore with a  pier cent or more mag-
nesium content

dictatorship in the americas

long before the days of nazism fascism and
other strong-arm rulers of today the incas

	had organized a party dictatorship over
a great number of indian tribes in south america

  they set up rules and regulations telling their
conquered peoples what they should wear whom
they should marry where they should live and
how they should earn a living the incas also
made sure that newly conquered tribes could not
revolt by splitting up the tribes and locating the
groups among tribes that had proven their loyalty
to the incas domination

  about every ten families were watched by an
inca official who in turn was watched by a higher
official and so on up till the chief of the incas

  the incas also had solved the problem of suc-
cession of chiefs foreseeing that the death of a
chief would cause endless squabbles among the
many right-hand men of the dead chief the
incas decided that rule should pass from father to
son thus the dictator chiefs were the royal
family of the incas and were accepted as such by
the people

a dying american industry

a little over a year ago the last of the
great american whalers was issued a per-
 mit to operate a shore station at humbolt
bay california

  this company is the only whaling concern left
from the hundreds of whaling companies that flew
the american flag in fact about a hundred years
ago the american fleet of whalers numbered al-
most six hundred out of the eight hundred ships
from all countries

  in  the total american catch was only 

whales while the total world catch ran well over
 whales with the withdrawal of the amer-
icans the industry has been taken over mostly by
the english norwegians and japanese

  the whales are usually hunted for their fat and
bone the fat is processed into oil which is used
in manufacturing soap perfumes as a base for
face cream to lubricate machinery and countless
other uses whale bone also finds a great many
uses in industry

  sor-ry sair cooed the little
brown man behind the show-
case no more elephant bells
all sold sair

  oh

  peter ames said it in the cheery tone
of a misanthropic undertaker his ex-
pression was the one hamlet would
have worn in the graveyard scene had
the melancholy dane been black irish
something else perhaps sair-
unless it costs less than eighty-four
cents young mr ames commented
gloomily youre wasting your time
showing it to me he sighed
mollyll just have to get along without
a birthday present-

  aieee

  the sound was reminiscent of that
given forth by a cat whose tail is caught
in a washing machines wringer peter
whirled

  the stores second clerk-a coppery
twin of the first-was dancing about
excitedly his quivering forefinger lev-
eled at the running figure of a man
as the figure scuttled into an alley
peter caught a glimpse of the face

  even the grimy window of the little
shop with its tarnished gilt lettering
announcing that this was the house of
oriental art cambodian curios a
specialty could not conceal one fact
the face was saffron-colored-unmis-

they were little silver bells worn by
elephants - and there was more of
memory in them than in the elephant




fantastic adventures

takably oriental

  peter turned back to the two brown-
skinned clerks well thanks for your
trouble friends-

  the pair exchanged hasty worried
glances their faces suddenly seemed
a bit gray then the man who had
been waiting on peter made a noisy
business of clearing his throat

  may i ask you humbly sair if the
lady for whom you desire the gift is
ver-ry close to your heart

  sure you can ask me peter
nodded gloomily his mind darting back
to his own troubles like a homing
pigeon to its own loft and the an-
swer is yes

  she would treasure your gift

  i guess so peter moped though
theres an ex-hoodlum by the name of
sam bienke trying to chisel in and
mollys so stuck onthe idea of reform-
ing him that she may forget about me
and what little i can do for her he
sighed not that i blame her too
much for going for him at that hes
got more dough than he knows what to
do with-throws presents at her like
id throw rocks at a rattlesnake

  the clerk was suddenly beaming
you sair shall give her a gift she
shall remember

  huh peter sounded perplexed
remember ive only got eighty-four
cents-

  it will cost you nothing sair the
brown-skinned clerk reassured him as
he spoke he drew a small teakwood box
from a drawer opened it a strange
silver ornament lay inside

  an elephant bell

  now the other clerk pattered up he
sputtered a mouthful of-to peter-
unintelligible syllables his face drawn
with worry the first oriental re-
sponded in kind

  while they argued peter examined
the bell

  it was about two inches in diameter
and made of silver instead of the cus-
tomary brass the portion above the
prongs was delicately etched with
weirdly beautiful patterns

  he rang it

  t-i-i-n-n-n-g-g

  the tone was as clear and silvery as
the metal itself

whew muttered peter its a
cinch this isnt one of the fifty-
nine-cent bargains i was hoping to pick

up

  the clerks stopped arguing

  you like it sair peters asked
anxiously

  sure young mr ames nodded
enthusiastically its a beauty but
i cant afford it-

  it is a gift sair a gift for you to
remember us by

  peter eyed the oriental with the air
that the farmer-fathers of lovely girls
look upon traveling salesmen

  i dont get it why should you
give-

  ah the brownie interrupted ecsta-
tically i too have been in love
sair he leaned forward confiden-
tially this bell is more than a
trinket my friend

  huh

  the clerk waggled an impressive
finger

  yes sair much more than a trin-
ket it is old-very old it comes
from angkor-wat capitol of the ancient
khmers once it adorned the ele-
phants of their kings

  but i cant take anything as valu-
able as that peter protested it be-
longs in a museum-

  the other shook his head no sair
it belongs with you and this girl-
people young and in love it is a bell
of memory of recollection-

  a bell of memory what do you
long remember



mean

  the clerk smiled the legends of
my people-i myself am a cambo-
dian-have it that the priests of ancient
angkor somehow transplanted the
great memory the retentiveness of
mind of thousands of royal elephants
into this bell so powerful was their
magic that it became a fountain of con-
gealed thought-a battery of memory

  a deed done in this bells presence
they say will live in the memories of
those involved until they die there
are tales of common coolies sair who
won the everlasting love of royal
khmer princesses because of one mo-
ment of passion beside this trinket

  some it endows with strange powers
of recollection men look at it and
like a crystal bdll it brings back the
scenes of their childhood or of any
moment they may desire

  and always it is a great force for
good it links conscience with
memory men remember their evil
deeds bitter as gall and the thought
of them rankles until they do penance


  you cant give a thing like that
away-

  the brown-skinned clerk smiled
somehow sadly it is my wish sair
i want you to take it

  well    well i certainly appre-
ciate it sir its a lovely gift indeed
for my molly

  again the clerk smiled you are
welcome sair now-he picked up a
salesbook-your name and address-
for our records

  sure peter ames  cedar
drive city

  the other carefully noted down the
information then returned the sales-
book to its place

  this is one of the few-the ver-ry
few-shops where you will find cam-
bodian objets dart sair he de-

clared leading peter across the shop
here for instance is a jade buddha
of a much later period than your
bell-

rjphe second clerk pattered up to
them you should not detain the
gentleman li  he scolded and then
turning to peter here sir is your
bell he extended the teakwood box

  thanks again to you both gentle-
men-

   here also is a letter continued the
second clerk would you be so kind
as to mail it at the first box you pass

  peter glanced at it it was addressed
to an importing company in san fran-
cisco

  of course and ill be in to see you
again

  but as he walked away young mr
ames was frowning

  i still dont get it he muttered
half-aloud that gag about helping
young love doesnt ring true to me
there must be another angle   
wonder if the bells hot-stolen from a
museum or something

  but his meditations were rudely in-
terrupted by the appearance of another
young gentleman a mr art adler he
rushed across the sidewalk toward
peter hand outstretched in enthusiastic
salutation

  peter sighed

  mr adlers weakness was his open-
handed generosity with other peoples
property that is to say he was the
kind of a character who having bor-
rowed your coat and pants will cheerily
request the loan of the vest when you
ask for the return of the first two
articles

  in a word mr adler was a conscien-
tious thorough-going deadbeat

  peter old boy he cried happily
pumping the others hand say
youre just the fellow i want to see


fantastic adventures

had a run of bad luck the other night
in a crap game left me stony hows
chances for a five til saturday
non-existent reported peter with
some asperity i just got a birthday
present for molly im broke too

  as evidence he opened the little
teak wood box and showed art the bell

  then reproachfully besides art
you already owe me eighteen bucks
remember

  young mr adler was staring at the
bell in most peculiar fashion

  yes peter he admitted i re-
member

  peters jaw dropped his eyes
bulged like a bullfrogs huh he
gasped you admit it

  yes a sigh in fact i guess its
time i paid you it sort of worries me
remembering that i owe you money
art pulled a wallet from his hip pocket
began counting out bills here ten
fifteen sixteen seventeen and
one more is eighteen again he shook
peters hand good-bye now

  he hurried away down the street
mr peter ames stood paralyzed
stiff and stark as cleopatras needle
his eyes mirrored the glassy stare of a
punch-drunk pug who had just ab-
sorbed another k o punch on the but-
ton

  it aint so he choked in a tight
unbelieving voice art adler paying
back borrowed money no it cant
oe

  but stranger things were yet to come

a head loomed the gaunt cadaver-
ous figure of a man whose face
bore the dour expression of a gestapo
agent alone with his conscience he
was almost on top of peter before the
black-haired young celt recovered his
wits from the shock of art adlers be-
havior

  arragh the man grunted er

   ames

  peter jumped mr whitney

  mr whitney was peters boss had
been for the past two years but this
was the first time since the hiring in-
terview that he had deigned to speak
to his subordinate

  the draft board called me about
your deferment as a defense worker
ames he announced

  yes sir

  i told them i wanted the deferment
continued

  thank you sir

  however-mr whitney shot him
a wary sidewise glance-youve got to
earn it of course

  you mean-

  if youll just plan on coming to
work an hour earlier from now on  

  the words which struck in peters
throat were of all the cheap chiseling
sweatshoppers in the trade but he
didnt quite let them out

  instead an idea came to him it
sizzled through his brain from cortex
to cerebellum

  mr whitney

  arragh

  young mr ames extended the teak-
wood box containing the silver bell

  isnt this a lovely bell mr whit-
ney i bought it for my girls birth-
day

  the look mr whitney returned him
was a masterpiece of disinterest ab-
ruptly peter changed the subject

  by the way sir when am i to get
the raise you promised to give me a year
ago remember

  mr whitneys eyes were suddenly
glued on the bell yet paradoxically
there was a far-away look in them

  yes i remember he agreed you
should have had it long ago ill tell the
payroll clerk to take care of it tomor-
row morning retroactive beginning a
year from the date you were hired
long remember



  peters head had not spun so since
the time he had ridden the loop-o-
plane three consecutive times at the
county fair he leaned against the
building before which they were stand-
ing for support

  got to be going now ames said
mr whitney his voice full of the cor-
diality ordinarily reserved for paying
customers ill take care of that the
first thing tomorrow morning though
you can count on it glad you re-
minded me of it now that i remember
it i cant see why i didnt attend to it
before now

  with that he was gone leaving his
reeling subordinate to stare wildly at
the little silver bell

volly connors had red hair
green eyes and the kind of figure
that the late florenz ziegfeld always
wished he could find

  a present she cried when young
mr ames handed her the teakwood
box and on opening it and examining
the bell oh peter its beautiful
truly beautiful darling she
kissed him in enthusiastic-albeit a bit
too sisterly fashion

  peter decided that the bells story
would have a splendid psychological ef-
fect so he told it to her in detail with
special emphasis on the strange powers
of memory it was supposed to impart

  thats why i wanted you to have
it molly he explained earnestly i
hoped twould keep the good times
weve known fresh in your heart i
wanted you to remember the joy we
two have known   

  molly was properly impressed

  its lovely darling she told him
softly her eyes misty with tenderness
as she traced the delicate exquisite
patterns adorning the silver bells sur-
face with her fingernail even with-
out magic no one could ever forget it

i know i never shall in proof she
curled up in peters arms like a lovely
contented kitten

  young mr ames mentally honored
cambodia the khmers elephants and
elephant bells in general and the two
brown-skinned clerks at the tiny curio
shop with separate  -gun salutes

  then the doorbell rang

  peter grunted whos that

  sam bienke probably molly ex-
tricated herself hes coming over
this evening too you know i couldnt
very well play favorites on my birth-
day

  sam bienke

  peters tone at the mention of his
rivals name was about the same as if
he had discovered a cockroach at the
bottom of his bowl of breakfast por-
ridge but before he could express him-
self further molly was opening the
door and in oozed sam bienke in
person

  mr bienke was a burly man or had
been in his prime now he looked like
he wore a girdle his hair was black
and kinky but glued tight to his head
with a particularly smelly pomade
grease gathered in the creases of his fat
face and little black eyes squinted out
from beneath shaggy black brows

  to put it mildly peter considered
him repulsive mr bienke reciprocated
the sentiment heartily

 beaming at molly sam stepped on
the tail of the connors family cat with
a neatly-maneuvered air of the acciden-
tal then guffawed at the animals an-
guished scream that tribute paid to
his own quaint sense of humor he got
down to the business of the evening

  you are certainly looking pretty
as a picture molly he stated smirk-
ing into what apparently was intended
to be a warm and friendly smile he
spoke with the stilted precision of an
eighth grade grammar lesson


fantastic adventures

  ill bet he has to watch his step on
what he says peter snorted to himself
he sounds like he came out of the
dese dem n dose school for me

  i have brought you a birthday
present molly the nauseous mr
bienke continued it is just a little
trinket but i thought you might like
it he held out a box about a foot
cube

  then pretending to notice peter for
the first time good evening mister
ames this must be quite a treat for
you indeed-being allowed to spend an
evening here instead of having to stay
down at the city mission with the rest
of the riff-raff

teter felt the color rising in his
cheeks like the tinted alcohol in a
thermometer resting on a red-hot stove
throwing an extra pair of half-hitches
around his irish temper he carefully
selected words for a reply

  the city mission he quizzed
are you sure you dont mean the
jail

  it was mr bienkes turn to blush
his not inconsiderable fortune had been
accumulated by devious fishings in pro-
hibitions troubled waters and it was an
open secret that he had escaped a long
state-arranged rest cure only through
undue financial familiarity with a later-
impeached district attorney

 now boys no quarreling
molly intervened

 to sam bienke oh sam you
shouldnt have spent so much money
and turning to peter look a
camera a real contax too

  photography is a very nice hobby
sam observed profoundly beaming on
molly i enjoy using a camera very
much myself with you taking nice
pictures too well have a lot in com-
mon

  molly shut him off hastily see

sam this is peters gift she held
up the elephant bell isnt it lovely

  even as she said it her eyes went
starry with memory she looked fondly
over at young mr ames

  some people put their junk in the
ash-can sam bienke commented
coldly others try to save money by
giving it away as birthday presents

  hitler has lots of money to spend
too peter retorted caustically

  boys please

  the pair settled into black silence
in vain did molly try to salvage the
evening neither would respond

  then suddenly flash bulbs were
popping in peters brain the corners
of his mouth twitched with the makings
of a wicked grin he became brightly
voluble-seemed to forget his irritation

  you know sam this bell has a
mighty interesting history he an-
nounced leaning forward and display-
ing the little silver ornament and in
spite of all herr bienkes glowerings
he launched the bells legend

  it really can do remarkable things
he declared you wouldnt believe it
a pause ill tell you lets try it on
you-

  i do not want to try anything you
can suggest mister ames sam
snapped

  oh but its all in fun peter
dangled the bell in front of his rivals
nose lets just see if it can make
you remember something youve for-
gotten lets see now   his
eyes were sparkling with suppressed
merriment ive got it this is
simple try to remember what you were
doing ten years ago tonight remem-
ber remember

rjphere was no question that mr

  bienke was remembering some-
thing he squirmed in his chair and
sweat poured down his face all in all
long remember



he looked thoroughly abject and miser-
able

  is it working sam peter probed
solicitously can you remember tell
us what you remember-

 damn you roared sam bienke
exploding angrily from his chair gram-
mar forgotten you damn well know
i remember ten years ago tonight
the cops was workin me over on dat
ravacholli bump-off you an dat
devils bell

  snatching up his hat he burst out
the door and away peter ames rock-
ing with laughter watched him go

 oh peter molly admonished
you shouldnt have done a thing like
that its cruel to remind him of a
phase of his life hes trying to forget
the bell still dangling between his
fingers peter faced her

  i know he agreed contritely it
was just that i kept thinking about how
happy we both were before he came
along remember

 miss molly connors irritation
melted like butter under an august sun

  but although sam bienkes face was
haggard with worry he already was at
mollys home when peter arrived the
next night he was instructing her in
the use of the expensive miniature
camera he had given her 

  it is very simple molly he was
explaining as young mr ames entered
the room first you must set your
stops for the aperture you desire next
you focus then press this button-
peter watched silently from the door-
way the object on which sam was
sighting was the silver bell standing
now in the center of the table
hello said peter

  molly and sam both looked around
the latter promptly got up forcing a
particularly greasy smile

  good evening peter he said tooth-
ily i stopped in to show molly how

to use her new camera but i must
go now he turned back to the girl
ill take these films with me molly
i know a place where i can have them
developed by tomorrow

  peter stared at mr bienkes depart-
ing back with all the confidence of an
early arizona settler welcoming an
apache war party

  that guys up to something he
muttered half-aloud

  peter youre too suspicious his
light-o-love scolded sam is a per-
fect gentleman

maybe then more brightly
remember how we said good-night
molly raised her face to his eyes
suddenly adoring ripe lips trembling
to be kissed   

  peter walked home whistling his
landlady met him at the front door

  theres two furriners in the livin-
room t see ye she whispered hoarsely
slinky-lookin if y ask me

  foreigners peters face was
blank he entered the living-room

jphe pair who rose to greet him were
close to being replicas of the two
cambodians who had given him the
silver elephant bell they bowed low
twin brown incarnations of politeness

  you ar-re mistair peter ames
yes-s effervesced the first

  peter grinned and nodded

  i are mister peter ames yes

  in the mood he was in he would
have greeted hirohito with the warm
right hand of fellowship

  both his brown-skinned visitors
beamed

  a silver elephant bell you bought
recently yes-s

  yes

  where is bell please

  peter eyed the pair thoughtfully
maybe you better tell me a little about
yourselves first he suggested just


fantastic adventures

why are you so interested

  the brownies exchanged glances
because peter went on i dont
think ill be telling you anything til i
know some of the answers

  the first of the little men sighed
the second echoed him

  our names they ar-re not impor-
tant said number one

  we ar-re cambodians explained
number two

  a strained silence

  go on from there peter urged
ver-ry well a sigh you leave
us no alternative we must speak i
am so sorry-

  the other interrupted you see
the bell was not really for sale
then why-

  the silver bell is a symbol num-
ber one went on to cambodians it
represents our era of power and free-
dom it is like angkor-an emblem
of the mighty khmers

  now nippon has overrun our land
broke in number two we ar-re but
vassals

  but cambodia shall rise again
number ones black eyes flashed fire
the day of rebellion is near at hand


  that is why the silver bell means
so much explained his companion ear-
nestly it stands for a free cam-
bodia the japanese know this
peter frowned then why was it
given to me

  it was sent to america for safe-
keeping-

  but the emissaries of nippon traced
it they feared its ver-ry existence
at last their agents found it was hid-
den in the house of oriental art

  peter nodded yes i saw a fellow
who looked like a japanese running
away from the place

  yes-s our countrymen saw him
knew they were trapped they gave

it to you then sent us your name and
address

  we came at once the other re-
ported gravely we found our
people had committed suicide rather
than risk betraying cambodias cause
under nipponese torture

  there was a long moment of silence
then

  and now mister ames said num-
ber one will you tell us where you
have put the bell

  im sorry said peter but im
afraid its not available

we must have it number
two broke in excitedly we
shall pay you well for it

  number one leaned forward impres-
sively

  a thousand dollars we shall give
you for it he cried even more
tell us how much you want

  it was given to a young lady peter
explained i wanted it as a birthday
present for her

  but you can get it back num-
ber two demanded eagerly

  peter shook his head no i can
see your point and i can understand
why you want it but i cant ask for it
back anything you do along that line
will have to be through the girl herself
ill give you her name and address
though - he scribbled them on a
pocket scratch pad-and you can
see her

  bubbling thanks the two little brown
men bowed out

  when peter called on molly two
nights later he again arrived only to
find sam there before him and this
time the irksome mr bienkes greeting
was even more slaverously cordial than
before

  peters eyebrows drew together in a
bleak suspicious line

  what are you up to bienke he
long remember



demanded and dont tell me you
love me for myself alone either
who me mr bienke was the
epitome of injured innocence why
peter there is no reason for us not be-
ing good friends after all look at all
we have in common we both are very
dear friends of molly-

  nuts grunted the youthful mr
ames

  sam gave vent to a reasonable fac-
simile of a sigh i do not see why
you must be so hostile peter he
declared in a plaintive voice i was
telling molly only a moment ago how i
admired you-

  yes peter molly interrupted
eagerly he was sam really wants
to be friends why he was just ad-
miring your birthday gift to me please
peter-

  peters black celtic hair seemed to
bristle nearly as much as his black
celtic temper he scowled adamantly
at san bienke

  again the latter sighed

  i can see it is no use molly he
reported with touching wistfulness
mister ames is too prejudiced ever
to see me as i am now that i have re-
formed i had better go

  shaking his head sadly he moved
toward the door peter stared after
him with cold and calculating eyes

  i dont like it he told molly
his ugly puss may be all injured in-
nocence but theres a gleam in his
eyes theres one guy the devil already
has found work for

  miss connors stamped her foot
peter ames youre worse than he
is she cried oh of all the mis-
trustful-

  grinning peter walked over to the
center table and picked up the ele-
phant bell

  lets not talk about it any more
dearest he suggested after all

theres so many other things more
worth while remember the pleasant
things-the fun weve had together the
places weve gone the things weve
done remember

gain miss connors stamped her
foot green eyes flashing of
course i remember she snapped
but dont go trying to change the sub-
ject youve been behaving like an
awful heel about sam bienke right
from the start and i wont have it i
ought to tell you to get out right now 
she gave the auburn curls a tem-
pestuous toss were going to settle
this thing right now peter ames once
and for all-

  but peter was not listening his
eyes were bulging like those of a rab-
bit hound which has just watched a
cotton-tail climb a tree his jawt had
assumed the same angle as that of
charlie mccarthy in a bewildered mo-
ment

 remember-

  if you think you can ride forever
on the fact that you were a nice boy
when i first started going with you
youre mistaken mister ames im
telling you right now that youve been
behaving like a stubborn egotistical
fool and im getting tired of it-
peter transferred his stunned gaze
from belle to bell he rang the latter
with trembling fingers

   t a-a-n-n-n-n-g-g 

  the note was a half-tone low
heedless to mollys diatribe peter
scrutinized the ornament his eyes
caught a dozen imperfections in the
delicate traceries which covered it

  a phoney

  he turned on molly

  when was sam here last

  why    this is the first time
since the other night when you were
here-
y

fantastic adventures

  young mr ames was out the door
before she could finish the sentence
he headed in the direction sam bienke
had gone full-tilt

  the third bartender he quizzed ad-
mitted to having seen his rival

  he said he was gonna walk home
the mixologist reported

  peter galloped out the door and down
the street which provided the most
direct route to the bienke villa

  if he gets away with this- he
fumed

  block after block he panted but no
signs came of the man he sought he
despaired almost gave up and then

  on the bridge crossing the white
river which flowed through the heart
of the city he sighted a familiar burly
figure sauntering casually along

  peter got his second wind and
sprinted onward in barely two min-
utes his hand slapped down on sam
bienkes thick shoulder

tjey you

      the nauseous mr bienke
about-faced fists raised pugnaciously
then recognizing peter he forced a
characteristically unpleasant smile

  oh it is you peter you startled
me

  ill bet i did the other retorted
grimly all right brother give

  injured innocence diffused over the
bienke physiognomy

  i do not believe i understand what
you mean peter

  save that guff for soft-hearted
girls came the caustic reply you
know what i mean you caught on
that the elephant bell was jimmying
things up for you so you took a pic-
ture of it then you had a duplicate
bell made and tonight you substituted
the phoney for the real thing only
youre not going to get away with it

so hand it back right now

 sam bienkes greasy face all at once
seemed to congeal into harsh lines

  chum that aint the way to talk
to a gent like me he warned sinis-
terly grammar forgotten youse is
out of your class

  ill say i am way down below it
so far i been puttin up wit you
the other continued but i aint
gonna do it much longer an if youse
ever mention bells to molly again you
can count on the dead-wagon crew
measurin you for a wooden kimono
before the weeks out got dat chum
peter leaned against the bridge rail-
ing and swallowed hard there was a
cold and menacing sincerity in his
rivals piggish little black eyes and
there was no question about sam
bienkes ability to plan and execute
a slight matter of murder any day in
the week

  what are you going to do with the
bell now that youve got it he asked
at last somewhat weakly

  sam drew the familiar silver bell
from his pocket he jingled it casually

  oh i dunno he eyed peter with
undue good cheer mebbe i could
remember youse by it    just in
case anyting happened to youse
one moment peter had the sensation
of icicles sliding down his spine the
next a flame of inspiration was leaping
through his brain

  well he sighed with a resignation
belied by the sudden malicious gleam in
his eyes if you want to spend the
rest of your life remembering what a
heel you are theres nothing i can do
about it

 hey-

  remember all the cheap dirty
crooked things youve done bienke
remember what a rat youve been
peters sneer would have driven dil-
linger to a monastic life of saintly re-
long remember



pentance for past sins and now-
youll spend every minute-every
second - remembering - how you
couldnt even play square with a girl
like molly how you had to cheat and
chisel-

 stop it shrieked sam big
greasy globules of perspiration were
standing out on his forehead the
hand that held the bell trembled like
the lady in september morn

  all your life you can remember-

  the burly bienke charged

an observer sam himself would
have disapproved of that wild rush
it lacked control the finer points
were absent-his head was not lowered
for a preliminary butt the knee did
not come up with the nicety of timing
necessary to incapacitate an opponent
the first blow was not devastating nor
did the elbow catry through for the
final coup so desirable in first-class
rough-and-tumble fighting

  peter on the other hand was com-
pletely the master of his situation
having goaded his rival into wrathful
battle he now stood back with fist
cocked ducked neatly under sams
guard and then came up with a right
to the chin which would have floored
an ox as effectively as any pole-ax

 mr bienke staggered backward
against the railing of the bridge his
knees began to buckle his fingers re-
leased the silver elephant bell

  before either he or peter could stop
it it fell to the bridges flooring
bounced once-and disappeared over
the edge into the black depths of the
white river

  oh moaned samuel bienke

  and young mr ames answered

 remember

 there was a tug anchored under
the bridge when peter crossed it on his
way to work the next morning a man

in a diving suit stood on the deck amid-
ships beside him paced a harried
worry-fraught sam bienke

  peter could not resist the tempta-
tion

  lose something he called

  sam looked up there were dark
circles under his eyes his jowls hung
loose

  ames he recognized peter
waved to him frantically come down
please peter- his voice was plain-
tive

  no thanks id rather keep my
health

  then youse will go down re-
marked a voice behind him

teter turned two large gentle-
men had materialized from nowhere
they stood very close to him and both
were keeping their hands in their coat
pockets

 come on the one who did the
talking ordered jerking his head
toward the end of the bridge

  peter gulped yes sir

  together the three of them went
out to the tug in a small motor boat
the diver was just going over the
larger vessels side

  the spokesman for the two thugs
who had captured peter addressed
bienke

  you want we should    take care
   of this guy boss

  naw sam shook his head he
looked even worse at close range than
from afar his face was that of a
greasy ghost naw i just wanna
talk to him

  he turned to young mr ames

  i gotta get that bell back he
babbled wildly im gonna go crazy
if i dont all the time i keep remem-
berin - just like you said he
clutched peters arm please chum
take dat curse offa me i cant stand


fantastic adventures

it no longer every mean ting i ever
done it come back i cant stand it
he was panting like a fish out of water

  a sudden wave of something almost
like pity swept over peter

  i dont know what i can do sam

  the other seemed scarce to have
heard him

  i tought mebbe id get away from
it if i was asleep he choked i got
a sawbones tgive me a shot in de arm
last night only den it was worse

  worse what happened

  i was in a place way out in th
woods-you know jungles it seemed
like there was big stone temples
an things i never seen nothin like it
before it was all full of little brown
guys-like chinks only not quite an
elephants-lots of elephants

  angkor

  huh naw no anchors just ele-
phants an these guys was torturin
me they stuck red-hot needles in mg
where theyd hurt me the most some
of em kept whippin de bottoms of me
feet-

  bastinado peters eyes were
bulging with amazement

  dey kept tellin me what a heel i
was said id have to make up for
it-said theyd keep on givin me de
hot-foot til i promised finly they
put some planks on my chest an got
all ready to make an elephant step on
em dats when i woke up the
man was shaking like a flagpole in an
earthquake

  peter shook his head he too was
a little pale

  i dont know what i can do about it
sam

  i cant stand it no more bienke
mumbled tonelessly i tought i could
take it-but not dat ill go nuts-

  a bell rang

  its the diver shouted a crew
member he wants to come up

   moment later the weird hel-
meted figure was being hoisted
aboard

  didja get it bienke demanded
eagerly didja

  the drivers face was grey

  im through he husked ill
never dive again 

  huh whassamatter

  the diver stopped the chattering of
his teeth with an effort i had your
damn bell he reported i even got
my hands on it only the second i
touched it i remembered one time
years ago when my air hose broke an
i come so close to drowndin that ill
never forget it

  all of a sudden it seemed like my
hose was gone again i was so scared
i couldnt think of anything i let go
of that bell like it was red hot and
yanked to come up

  you had it an then let it go-
the diver met bienkes glare with
one equally ferocious you aint sear-
in me none he snapped go hunt
for your damn bell yourself if you
want it me i aint divin again-
now or ever

  by the time peter finally succeeded
in tearing himself away from the
haunted quavering sam bienke he
was an hour late for work- he stuck
his head through the shops door in the
same speculative manner with which
a mouse investigates the family cats
alertness

  he could have saved himself the
trouble mr whitney was lurking just
inside

  arragh he snarled late again
eh

  peter nodded mutely then but



  that was as far as he got

  you can save your excuses young
man i saw you loafing on a boat down
in the river-
long remember



  but mr whitney-

  -and im not going to stand for it
you can draw your pay at the office
youre fired

  it was afternoon before peter-pay
drawn tools checked out lunch eaten
and clothes changed-rang the doorbell
at mollys

  the lovely miss connors welcomed
him with open arms

  darling she cried oh you
were right you were right-

  eh he reared back like a fright-
ened colt what about

  molly snuggled against his shoulder
about sam bienke silly he came
in and told me everything
everything-

  yes all about how h stole the
bell and how hed threatened to kill
you and-and everything he said
that now he realized how wrong hed
been and that he was going to try to
sooth his conscience by leaving here
and starting over again devoting his
life to doing good

peter breathed a sigh of relief the
specter of sam bienkes gunmen had
been haunting him ever since the night
before

  molly looked up at him adoration
shining in her eyes

  i know now how wrong ive been
peter she murmured repentantly
it must have been terribly trying for
you to have me take up with him a
pause but thats all over now
dearest well be married whenever
you want to

  oh

  peter you dont sound as if you
wanted to marry me

  young mr ames swallowed hard
he was suddenly aware of exactly how
socrates had felt when the jailer held
out the cup of hemlock

  honey he gulped things have

been    happening   

  what do you mean miss con-
nors tone was not all dulcet

  haltingly peter outlined the sad sad
story of what had happened at the shop
that morning

  you see he concluded it  it
means ill have to get a job out of
town theres not many spots for
guys like me right around here and
i cant very well marry you til ive
saved some money

  the lovely molly stepped back out
of his arms and shot him a look which
harsh and uncompromising realists
might have construed as a glare

  there are times she remarked a
bit acidly when i wonder why i love
you a moments hesitation theres
no reason in the world why you
shouldnt have saved some money
none snapped peter except that
i was spending it all on you then
abjectly i know i should have
saved some

  indeed you should molly agreed
primly

  peter swallowed hard his eyes som-
ber

  but since you didnt molly went
on well get married anyhow

  and then suddenly she was tight
in peters arms laughing and crying
at once and running her fingers
through his rumpled black hair and
kissing him with a most unladylike en-
thusiasm

  the shock was too much for peter
but weve got to have some
money- he wailed

  weve got money silly all we
need

  molly dont joke about it

  im not joking darling we have
her face was radiant with happiness
you see after you ran out last night
two little brown men called they
wanted to buy the bell they told me


fantastic adventures

theyd tried to persuade you to get it
for them but that you wouldnt do it
because it had been a present to me

  well i decided right then that i
was going to marry you and while it
doesnt sound sentimental i thought
we could get more good out of the
money than the bell so i sold it-
but it wasnt the real bell peter
protested it was phoney-

  of course but theyd offered me
a thousand dollars for it sight unseen
naturally i wouldnt have held them
to it when they found it wasnt the one
they wanted

  they knew it was a fake the instant
they saw it they kept chattering
away at each other though and finally
they decided the real one must have
gotten lost somewhere along the line
so a good substitute was better than
nothing at all and they said it wasnt
my fault i didnt have the real bell so
they gave me the thousand dollars any-

stand on october rd

d ight now well pass on a few fantastic true
bits that weve dug up in recent days they
are certainly worth passing on and they will
serve to show how fantasy can sometimes be
fact and still have a place in a book like this

trom vichy france comes the announcement
that french scientists in the new french ob-
servatory on the pic du midi have succeeded in
making color films of scientific interest of the
sun and of the planet mars

   the films by carmichell gentile and bernard

how i didnt want to take it but they
said theyd lose face if after offering
it they didnt pay it

  darling whispered peter

  and on top of the money molly
went on her eyes starry they left me
all those lovely memories of us to-
gether that that beautiful old legend
promises a pause theyll stay
with us through all eternity peter
for a long moment he held her very
tight then

  come on molly were to go down
town right now

  go down town the girl looked
a little bewildered what for dar-
ling

  peter flashed her an irish grin as
broad as the blarney stone

a bride who pays for her own
honeymoon deserves at least some little
gift in appreciation he cried so im
going to buy you an elephant bell
the end

lyot are a series of moving picture shots show-
ing various characteristics of the sun and the

   the observatory which will be the largest in
europe is nearing completion but it will be a
year or more before its largest telescope now being

scientific advancement is still going on in tragic
france

if dr william l straus jr of johns

	hopkins medical school is correct in his
theory he will have exploded a belief long held
by layman and scientist alike that mans earliest
ancestors often swung from branch to branch
through the trees the way monkeys do today
dr straus has studied the arm muscles of man
and is convinced that at no time did mans an-
cestors pass through a tree swinging age

   while it is true that orangutans gorillas
chimpanzes and humans have many character-
istics of the forearm flexor muscles in common
the editors notebook



this does not prove a common origin for both man
and the anthropoid apes dr straus points out
that there are special characteristics of the human
arm muscle which distinguish them from those
of the apes and upon this difference he bases his
theory that mans ancestors never traveled through
the trees by swinging with his arms

tr m j neumann de margitta of
new york city has been awarded patent
no  covering his new photoflash bulb
that uses synthetic plastics instead of glass he
claims that the new flash bulb will produce a
more intense light for taking pictures moreover
the bulb is safer to handle since it would be
harmless if it exploded because there would be a
shower of plastic instead of dangerous glass

  the bulb can also stand more handling punish-
ment and therefore does not require the expensive
wrapping and caution needed by the present flash
bulb its greater light intensity will enable the
photographer to use a smaller sized plastic bulb
for his work	k

  plastic used to make the bulb is translucent
flexible cellulose acetate and the bulb contains the
regular metal foil which produces the flash to
make the foil burn with greater intensity oxygen
is pumped into the bulb under pressure

  the patent has been assigned to the westing-

a ccording to the new jersey agricultural
experiment station rainy seasons cause oys-
ters to become fat and good eating while in
the drought years the oysters are lean and not as
tasty

  the reason the rainfall is so beneficial to
oysters is another case of the interdependence so
often found in nature first of all the oysters
depend upon the tiny one-celled plants of the
sea for their food these plants in turn cannot
grow in great abundance unless the water con-
tains the necessary mineral nutrients the heavy
rainfalls wash the mineral salts into the sea from
the land in times of plentiful rain the oysters
flourish but when the rains are few and far be-
tween the vital salts do not feed the one-celled
plants who do not reproduce in sufficient num-
bers to feed the oysters in fact the best seasons
of all for oysters usually follow periods of huge
floods when large stores of mineral salts are washed
into the sea for the mutual benefit of both the
tiny micro-plants and the connoisseur who enjoys
a fat oyster

tr j p bennett associate professor of
plant physiology at the university of cali-
fornia has been experimenting with trees in the
inactive state he found that he could make
the twigs return to normal growing by injecting
an extract of yeast into the branches he pro-
duced the same result by preparing his extract
from plant tissues taken from various active and

inactive parts of the trees or from some very
common inorganic nitrogen salts all of these
substances used to produce the extract contain
nitrogen

   now it is a fact that if trees are not thoroughly
chilled during the winter they do not grow prop-
erly in the spring but dr bennetts experiment
showed that the injection of an extract contain-
ing nitrogen produces the same effect as the
chilling having the curiosity of a true scientist
dr bennett is now investigating how the winter
chilling is able to furnish the chemical containing
nitrogen that causes the trees to grow each spring

tf the experiments carried on by the institute
of biochemistry at moscow prove to be as
successful as first reports indicate a new and
abundant source of vitamin c has been discovered
reports show that the soft outer shell of an
unripe walnut possesses a generous supply of
vitamin c moreover the vitamin can be re-
moved from the shell and treated to remove
the bitterness to produce a concentrate of the
vitamin the large crop of walnuts grown in
russia should produce a huge supply of vitamin
c by this simple process

text book on mythology

  nobody seemed to mind the name
least of all pegasus itself which by this
time had settled down to the tired rou-
tine of an outdated unstreamlined five
passenger sedan

  like all average owners of automo-
biles mr bottle turned an eye each
year to the tempting advertisements
featuring new motor cars but like a
great many of similarly situated citi-
zens mr bottle quite invariably de-
cided to put off the idea of a new ma-
chine until this note was met or that bill
was paid

  and so pegasus stayed on scarcely
gaining dignity with age but never-
theless continuing to serve the utilita-
rian purpose of taking mr bottle to
and from his place of employment six
days a week

  an average car an average owner
and the relationship between car and
owner might always have been an indif-
ferent one had it not been for two fac-
tors the first factor was the chang-
ing times and world tumult the
second factor really a result of the first
was the news-broadcast mr bottle
heard on the automobile radio while
driving home from work in pegasus
that friday afternoon   

  mr bottle had tuned in on his favor-
ite station to get the early afternoon
news summary with no idea at all of
what a pronounced effect the days grim
tidings would have on him personally

  he listened to the commentary on the
balkan situation with his usual imper-
sonal interest nodded emphatically
when hearing that certain statesmen
had advised that the government take
a stronger attitude toward vichy felt
remotely shocked to learn that two
thousand chinese had been wiped out
in a dastardly bombing of chinshi and
smiled knowingly at the news that the
white sox looked forward to a pennant

in the coming season but through all
this mr bottles tranquility of spirit
was undisturbed

  it was the closing news announce-
ment that almost resulted in his driving
pegasus off the highway and into a
ditch it caught mr bottle directly be-
tween the eyes

  automobile owners the radio an-
nouncers voice declared have been
advised by the office of civilian supply
that they face a complete shut-down of
motorcar assembly lines not only will
there be no new machines made in this
country for the duration of the war
but even such essential repair and sup-
ply parts as may be necessary to main-
tain the old ones will be strictly yes
rigidly rationed what few automo-
biles and parts as still remain on as-
sembly lines have already been placed
under rationing regulations motorcar
owners are advised that their only
chance of getting through this war on
four wheels is to take extraordinarily
good care of the automobiles they now
own

twtr bottle scarcely realized that
his hands still guided pegasus
steering wheel he was even less aware
that the highway along which he was
driving was narrowing and that he was
in the outskirts of his own suburb

  the shock of the announcement left
mr bottle temporarily dazed it wasnt
until automatically he had turned up
the pleasant little suburban side street
where he had his modest home that he
began to come out of his shocked stupor

  and when he brought pegasus to a
halt at the curb in front of his house
mr bottle snapped off the ignition
switch and making no move to get out
sat there staring dully ahead through
the windshield

  mr bottle was digesting the un-
savory import of that news bulletin
pegasus plays priorities



  no more cars-and worse than that
no more parts for cars

  mr bottle was trying to recall a com-
ment made over the radio just the night
before by some authority on military
affairs the authority had hinted dark-
ly that this could well develop into a
ten year war

  sickly mr bottle thought of the slim
chances poor pegasus had of living an-
other ten years on sudden impulse
mr bottle snapped the ignition switch
back on and started the motor

  pegasus roused to life motor knock-
ing merrily front fenders rattling hap-
pily from the vibration

  mr bottle listened to these familiar
noises and shuddered then he snapped
off the switch and sat back sickly what
would he do when pegasus wore out
and worse than that how much longer
dared he hope that pegasus would last

  oh why oh why didnt i get a new
car last year mr bottle berated him-
self mentally but such questions of
course were of scant comfort

  mr bottle spent the next five min-
utes mentally wondering how in hell
he would ever get to his place of gainful
employment each day after pegasus
finally expired

  finding no answer to this question
mr bottle then proceeded to draw men-
tal pictures in which he and his family
slowly starved to death

  these grim portraits of the future left
him a trifle frantic and in the back of
his brain there suddenly flashed a spir-
ited grim-jawed resolve

  pegasus will not die mr bottle
muttered savagely pegasus shall not
die 

  that was it-that was the only solu-
tion

  and suddenly mr bottle saw the pic-
ture as it stood his own existence the
very food that went into his mouth and
the mouths of his family depended

solely now on the survival of pegasus
for the duration

  harrrrooooollld 

  the voice loud and feminine inter-
rupted mr bottles mental delibera-
tions he looked up sharply to see
alice his wife standing on the porch
of their home

  alice was a plain pleasant looking
woman thin and on the shortish side
she was at the moment standing with
hands on hips and frowning with an-
noyance

  grimly mr bottle climbed out of
pegasus and marched up the walk to-
ward her women he was thinking bit-
terly are never aware of a crisis he
decided to withhold the bleak news from
her until after dinner

vvhat on earth were you sitting
out there in pegasus for alice
greeted mr bottle

  i was said mr bottle with lofty
dignity thinking

  what about for goodness sakes
alice demanded

  things said mr bottle darkly
things

  alice bottle sighed and followed her
husband in through the door eighteen
years of married life with harold had
left her wise enough to recognize his
thinking moments as little more than
sporadic broodings over life and its
complexities

  well dinner will be cold if you dont
get upstairs and wash right away she
told him

  mr bottle glowered briefly at his
wife and clumped up the stairs to the
washroom when he came down to din-
ner some ten minutes later he wore
the tattered clothes in which he gen-
erally did garden puttering

  my heavens harold alice ob-
served in some alarm over the mashed
potatoes this isnt saturday after-


fantastic adventures

noon you know

  mr bottle dug fiercely into his roast
beef he waited until he was busily
masticating a huge hunk of it before he
answered

  im perfectly well aware of that
he snapped

  alice bottle looked at her husband
curiously for an instant then went back
to eating in silence whatever was on
his mind would soon pass by she rea-
soned   

  it was while alice busily washed the
dishes that mr bottle crashed about in
the cellar grabbing rags and buckets
and then he stamped upstairs into the
kitchen to fill the buckets noisely seize
the best bar of soap and without ex-
planation march grimly through the
living room and out to the front curb

  alice saw him out in front of the
house some fifteen minutes later sav-
agely soaping and splashing and polish-
ing the sides of old pegasus she saw
and marvelled for aside from the
twice yearly wash given pegasus when
junior was home over the summer from
school this was an unknown occur-
rance

  she shook her head bewilderedly at
this and went back to her nightly peru-
sal of the civilian defense handbook
alice bottle was extremely active these
days in matters relating to the conflict
there was the red cross the uso
and the newly organized suburban ci-
vilian defense womens league to
all of these alice devoted every second
she could spare from her household du-
ties the last named especially being
her favorite organization

  mr bottle red-faced and perspiring
clumped into the house with buckets
full of dirty water and sopping black-
ened rubbing rags perhaps half an
hour later

  his jaw had the grim set of a man

who has performed a vital and signif-
icant mission creditably after he had
emptied the dirty buckets into the clean
sink and returned to the living room
alice looked up from her handbook

  maybe harold you can tell me
what this is all about alice suggested

  i cleaned the car mr bottle an-
swered challengingly anything wrong
with that

  alice bottle rose and looked out the
window she turned back to her hus-
band

  i havent seen pegasus gleaming so
in at least eight years she admitted
but what prompts your sudden con-
cern over the appearance of the poor
thing

  i dont suppose mr bottle said
acidly that youve heard the radio re-
ports today

  alice bottle admitted she hadnt
adding that shed been too busy with her
war work

atr bottle bade his wife to sit
down then and when she was
seated he began to pace-back and forth
giving to her in every last dreadful de-
tail the news report hed heard on the
way home earlier that afternoon

  it may be said for alice bottle that
she listened without any noticeable hor-
ror and when mr bottle had come to
a dramatic conclusion her answer was
startling

  well harold she observed that
shouldnt be so terrible it will affect
everyone just as it will us lord knows
if you have to get up an hour earlier
every morning to catch the city train
it wont kill you

  mr bottle regarded his wife with
open mouthed amazement

  perhaps he said bitterly you
didnt catch the full import of my
words the city train doesnt stop
within ten miles of my office in town i
pegasus plays priorities



could never get to work on time even
if i got up three hours earlier-which
would be silly for therere no trains
then

  alice shrugged

  theres no immediate worry any-
way harold pegasus isnt going to
gasp and die for a while yet and if
the poor thing should eventually well
work it out somehow

  mr bottles eyes gleamed like the
last christian at the stake he threw
one arm wide in a dramatic gesture

  even if you arent aware of the ter-
rible implications of this thing he
shouted i am and i am smart enough
to know that from now on pegasus must
take first place on any and all priorities
as far as were concerned that car
must be kept alive its life is our life 
so saying mr bottle stormed out of
the room and was heard a moment later
clumping heavily up the stairs he was
a man weighted deep with the stern
struggle for survival which had been so
suddenly thrust upon him   

  morning came to end a fitful night of
sleep for mr bottle and when he
came downstairs to find his wife pre-
paring breakfast he was met with a
coldly reproachful glare

  harold alice bottle demanded
without preamble what do you mean
by covering pegasus with our spare
blankets during the night

  mr bottle met her glance with one
of righteous indignation

  were you using those blankets he
asked acidly

  alice bottles lips went tight they
are practically new

  there was a frost last night mr
bottle said patiently cold pegasus
had no covering what did you expect
me to do

  pegasus has stood outside the house
in fair weather and foul for all of ten
years alice bottle said frigidly it

has never caught cold as yet

  mr bottle gave her a bitter glance
and sat down to his bacon and eggs

  i brought those blankets in the mo-
ment i saw them alice bottle an-
nounced indignantly from the kitchen
i didnt want the neighbors to think
youd suddenly gone insane

  we will have to make room in the
budget for a garage for pegasus mr
bottle growled through a mouth stuffed
with toast

  why dont you fix up our guest
room alice asked acidly

  mr bottle choked on the coffee he
was in the process of swallowing he
rose stiff with rage tossed aside his
napkin reached for his hat and started
for the door

jk lice followed him into the hall

      get back in time to meet the
train at three wont you harold she
asked

  train asked mr bottle frostily
what train he knew damned well
what train

  just because youre angry there is
no need to be irritating alice told him
sharply you know very well what
train the one from new york on
which mrs dushong the national or-
ganizer for the womens civilian de-
fense league is arriving

  oh yes mr bottle said nastily
i remember you invited her to stay
over the weekend with us while she
looks over your civilian defense wom-
ens league you hope by such toady-
ing to have her name you president of
the league isnt that right

  alice bottle flushed her husband
had cut deep and close to the truth
but she would not be left without the
last word

  please try not to act the boor while
mrs dushong is with us she snapped
her impression of the weekend with


fantastic adventures

us will mean a great deal

  mr bottle flushed boor eh
boor eh

  he was still mumbling that when he
stepped up to the running board of
pegasus and then quite suddenly
with the sight of the car his quarrel
with his wife vanished from his mind

  mr bottle stood there a moment
proudly surveying the wash and rub
job hed done on the machine the night
before pegasus looked years younger
he decided well months anyway

  he climbed in conscious of the fact
that his wife was probably watching
him from the window he frowned an-
grily damn women who didnt com-
prehend serious situations

  mr bottle started the machine gave
the horn a defiant toot for the benefit
of his wife and was off

  it was mr bottles practice to stop
each morning for gas at joes service
station an establishment on the edge
of the suburb directly at the main high-
way fork and not being a man to fly
in the face of habit mr bottle headed
pegasus in that direction this morning

  joes service station had but one
competitor a lavish establishment on
the other side of the highway fork which
operated under the swanky name of
leons limousine lounge leons was
patronized by the ultra wealthy mem-
bers of the suburban community and
mr bottle had often been heard to
state that hed be damned if hed pay
double for such foolish flim-flam

  and so when mr bottle reached the
highway fork he threw a contemptuous
glance at leons limousine lounge and
whipped the steering wheel hard to the
right which should have brought him
crunching up the gravel drive into joes
service station

  but to his horror the steering wheel
seemed suddenly to have become a
futile liquid whirlingly aimless thing

in his hands and pegasus instead
turned to the left and moved smoothly
up in front of the luxurious leons lim-
ousine lounge it then came to an
abrupt stop

cour attendants looking like ad-
mirals at a washington conference
had dashed out of leons limousine
lounge to surround the startled mr
bottles automobile before he realized
what had happened

  tire manicure asked one smiling
pleasantly

  fender buff asked a second

  ten or fifteen gallons sir a third
demanded already detaching the gas
hose from the side of the deluxe tank
marked c per gal

  mr bottle was far too shocked to
answer he shook his head hard from
side to side and the attendants seemed
to interpret it as an affirmative gesture
for they were suddenly swarming all
over pegasus

  fenders were buffed

  tires were manicured

  oil was changed

  gas at thirty cents a gallon gushed
into the tank

  windows were shined door handles
polished headlights wiped

  grease was squirted here and there
in pegasus underquarters

  hubcaps were removed cleaned re-
placed

  and finally a smiling young admiral
shoved a notated bill through the win-
dow at mr bottle

  that will be six-fifty sir he
beamed

  sickly mr bottle paid off and when
he started up pegasus the machine
seemed almost buoyantly serene and
then mr bottle remembered the useless
steering wheel he turned it sharply
right and left but no longer was it
liquid pegasus now responded most
pegasus plays priorities

u

perfectly to bottles slightest touch

  there was no possible explanation
for the sudden cold presentiment that
assailed mr bottle for the sensations
accompanying the presentiment were
impossibly ridiculous

  and yet in spite of his sanity mr
bottle had the very definite sensation
that pegasus was inordinately pleased
pleased in a very human way pleased
and smug over the trick it had played
to get mr bottle into leons limousine
lounge

  for mr bottle couldnt tell himself
differently it had been a deliberate
maneuver by pegasus that brought him
into that sedan salon there was no
other way of accounting for it

  a cold sweat broke out on mr bot-
tles brow   

  by the time mr bottle had reached
his office in town he had succeeded
in working himself into a state border-
ing on a nervous breakdown

  for during the hour-long drive other
things had occurred to needle poor
bottle even further other things which
might well have been the result of mr
bottles state of mind - and again
might have been actually what he sus-
pected them to be

  there was for example the red-
light just coming into town stopping
for it mr bottle observed that off the
sidewalk to his right there was an
enormous plate glass window which
was so highly polished that it reflected
pegasus with remarkable clarity and
sharpness of detail

  it might have been some temporary
fault in the motor indeed the car-
buretor might well have been slightly
flooded however so when the red-
light changed to green pegasus refused
to start up

  while cars behind tooted madly for
them to move along pegasus and mr
bottle remained as they were until-

so it seemed to the now distraught
bottle-the old sedan had taken a long
and thoroughly admiring study of its
reflection then and only then did
pegasus react to mr bottles frantic
efforts to set it into motion ance more

jphere were other things smaller
and less startling than the one just
mentioned trifling circumstances
which an unsuspicious bottle would
never have noticed

  but with the situation as frighten-
ingly suggestive as it was mr bottle
was stimulated to even greater frenzy
of mind by such additional trivia

  and when pegasus flatly refused to
turn into the viaduct ramp where mr
bottle daily parked it free of charge
and in spite of his frantically futile
efforts to control the steering wheel
took him helplessly to a swank park-
ing-garage service right next door to
mr bottles office building the owner
of the arrogant sedan teetered for five
precarious minutes on the brink of
madness

  finally however mr bottle was
temporarily rid of pegasus and clutch-
ing a garage-parking ticket in his trem-
bling fist he entered his office

  the switchboard girl on seeing him
set the keynote for the rest of the re-
marks made to him during that day

  what happened mr bottle she
demanded you look whiter than a
ghost

  bottle didnt bother to answer he
made his way unsteadily through the
stenographic enclosure and staggered
into his small corner office

  mr bottle did little work that day
he tried of course tried desperately
in the hope of burying himself so deep
in honest toil as to escape the
devilishly terrifying thoughts that
plucked at the back of hisjarain

but he had small success with this


fantastic adventures

scheme wild impossible ideas beat
against his mind his wifes words for
example why dont you fix up our
guest room kept coming into his con-
sciousness and then hed have hideous
mental visions of pegasus four wheels
and all curled up snugly in bed in their
spare room

  in the space of an hour he developed
a terrible phobia which made him start
with fright every time a visitor en-
tered the outer office start with fright
for fear the visitor might be pegasus
who had somehow come up in the ele-
vator

  and at last the short shift saturday
dragged to an end

  mr bottle lingered in his cubicle
of an office however until the rest of
the staff had gone and then he made
his departure in a far more frightened
state than when hed entered

  the thoughts of going down to that
garage-parking place presenting his
ticket paying his fee and redeeming
pegasus from among the many-floored
and modern ramps was almost more
than mr bottle could bear

  he cringed at the thought of slip-
ping behind the frighteningly mutinous
steering wheel of pegasus again and
as a consequence he started for a walk
on leaving the building a walk in the
opposite direction from the parking-
garage location a walk in which he
planned to gather courage

  the walk went on and bn for perhaps
fifteen minutes before mr bottle was
finally forced to admit to himself that
he would never stiffen his spirit this
way

  mr bottle came to this conclusion
when coincidentally enough he hap-
pened to be passing a retail liquor
store

  a saloon as a source for courage
would never enter bottles head for
since his somewhat scandalous college

days mr bottle had done little tip-
pling and that only in moderation in
the proper surroundings of his own
home

  but a retail liquor store where one
could purchase the stuff in a bottle and
imbibe say in the quiet of his office
struck mr bottle as being one hell of
a nice convenience to the saloon-shy

vtr bottle stopped at the store
long enough to purchase a quart
of good bourbon then retracing his
steps he took himself and his package
back to the now deserted office

  in his own cubicle office mr bottle
found a glass and set to work starch-
ing his soul

  it was a relatively simple matter
a matter of some five stiff shots

  what a fool i am mr bottle told
himself contemptuously after the
second shot had burned its way down
his gullet what a blasted stupid
fool

  a grown man mr bottle snorted
in self-denunciation after his third
drink a solid substantial citizen-
letting myself believe in such fairy
tales

  i must have been temporarily in-
sane mr bottle decided after his
fourth stiff one thash it temporarily
inshane

  whatm i doing here sopping my-
shelf up with thish lousy likker he
wondered aloud after the fifth one
why im hiding from pegasush
thash what i oughtta be shamed
grown man damn childishnesh to
hell with the likker to hell with
pegasush

  and mr bottle then weaved out of
his cubicle a trifle unsteadily not how-
ever before pausing to pick up and
cork the liquor he had denounced a mo-
ment before and place it in his coat
pocket   
pegasus plays priorities



ythen they brought pegasus down
to mr bottle from the ultra mod-
ern twenty-sixth story ramp he favored
it with a challenging sneer and without
a moments hesitation slipped in be-
hind the wheel

  im giving orders now under-
shtand mr bottle demanded of his
automobile once they were out in the
street again

  and there seemed not the slightest
sensation of any disagreement on the
part of pegasus to this statement in
fact there seemed to be nothing at all
remaining to hint at the strange per-
sonification of the machine that had
been so terrifyingly evident that
morning

  it was approximately twelve-thirty
mr bottle noted as he steered pegasus
along through the mid-day traffic
twelve-thirty and he didnt have to
to get back to meet the train and the
dushong woman until three plenty of
time for another drink

  mr bottles face felt flushed his
head a trifle heavy as he turned pe-
gasus off down a side street where
under a deserted l trestle he halted
the car and pulled forth his bottle

  heresh to pegasush mr bottle
toasted lifting the bourbon to his lips
and taking a mighty gulp

  heresh to mrs dushong he an-
nounced a minute later repeating the
process

  mr bottle was having difficulty now
in adjusting his vision to point where
things lost their fuzzy blur he
lifted the bottle to his lips again and
took another swig

  mr bottle then corked the whisky
and placed it carefully on the floor be-
side him he leaned back then head
swimming an overpowering wave of
fatigue was sweeping over him the
day the shock the worry and exer-
tion-the liquor

  in less than two minutes mr bottle
was snoring deeply   

rjphe first thing of which mr bottle
was conscious when he opened his
eyes was the fact that he had a split-
ting headache the next thing he no-
ticed was the fact that his wrist watch
said it was less than twenty minutes
until three oclock

  horrified mr bottle sat bolt up-
right

  almost three

  he must have passed out he must
have slept for close to two hours mrs
dushongs train was arriving in the
suburb at three oclock and he was
still in town with a good hours drive
ahead of him before he could get home

  mr bottle forgot his splitting head-
ache mr bottle forgot everything but
the terrifying fact that hed fail to meet
that train in time mr bottle reached
wildly for the ignition switch and in
so doing happened to glance through
the car window on his right

  his mouth fell wide open and stayed
that way his eyes bugged out until
they could have been knocked off with
a stick

  mr bottle was home right out in
jront of his house

  the words came choking from mr
bottles lips before he was aware that
he had arrived at such a conclusion

  pegasus brought me home

  mr bottle sat there stupefied he
didnt know whether to laugh or cry
or scream pegasus had brought him
home from town while he lay sound
asleep in the front seat

  it was impossible absolutely insane
yet how else could this have happened
how else could he having passed out
under a metropolitan l structure
wake up to find himself parked in front
of his suburban house

  it then occurred to mr bottle to

wonder how long he had been here
it also occurred to him to wonder
whether or not any of the neighbors
had noticed his decidedly unique ar-
rival

  guiltily mr bottle reached down
and picked up the quart of bourbon
which still reposed upright on the floor
supposing alice should come out to
see what he was doing lingering in
pegasus again the thought chilled
mr bottle to the marrow alice did
not disapprove of his having an occa-
sional drink in his home but lying in
an automobile swilling from a quart
bottle would be something else again

  whitely concealing the bottle under
his coat mr bottle climbed out of
pegasus and moved cautiously around
to the back of the machine he held
the keys to the trunk in his trembling
hand and his intention was to hide the
damning evidence in there until he
could find some other way of disposing
of it

  mr bottle wasted a precious two
minutes fumbling with the key in the
lock somehow he couldnt find the
right key he was sorting through
the key ring looking frantically for
another one when he heard alices
voice coming from the front porch

  harrroooooooold 

  mr bottle was a man berserk with
terror looking wildly right and left
he saw no possible concealment for the
damning bottle and then his eye fell
upon the gas tank aperture quickly
scarcely realizing what he was doing
mr bottle took the cap from the gas
tank uncorked the bottle and emptied
the contents of the bottle into the tank
swiftly then he replaced the cap
dropped the empty bottle to the curb
and kicked a little dirt over it

  fighting for composure mr bottle
stepped around the car and into the
view of alice standing on the porch

  yes dear mr bottle shouted

  hurry over to the depot or youll
miss the three oclock train alice told
him you certainly took your time
getting home i thought you were
through at noon today

  i worked late mr bottle lied at
the top of his lungs he felt a little
bit relieved pegasus had evidently
just rolled up with him before the
house when hed emerged from his al-
coholic nap probably no one had no-
ticed anything

  well please hurry harold alice
told him its almost a quarter to
three it takes a good ten minutes
to get over to the depot

tvtr bottle nodded and started
back to the door of the car then
he remembered the strange antics of
pegasus especially this last incredible
demonstration of the cars weird ani-
mation he went pale once more hesi-
tating with his hand on pegasus door-
knob

  supposing i walk mr bottle
shouted to his wife its a wonderful
day and and ah mrs dushong could
see the village better

  from th porch alice glared at him

  if youre thinking of saving tires
or of conserving pegasus parts you
arent being subtle about it please
get into that car at once and meet mrs
dushong

  mr bottle sighed tremulously
there seemed to be nothing he could
do he couldnt very well explain to
alice that he didnt want to ride in
pegasus because he believed it was
alive

  but dear- mr bottle tried one
last game effort

  please hurry alice snapped
there was an ominous tightness at the
corners of her mouth

  mr bottle gave up the battle like
pegasus plays priorities



a man stepping into the jaws of a
carnivorous whale mr bottle climbed
in behind pegasus wheel his hands
were shaking as he switched on the
ignition and kicked the starter

  pegasus awoke roaring mightily as
its fenders shook and its parts rattled
mr bottle threw the machine into gear
and turned out into the street

  it was then that pegasus unleashed
a deafening salvo of backfire thun-
derous snorts rent the air like tremen-
dous explosions and the car moved
jerkily forward

  alarmed mr bottle threw the gears
into second but the din of the ex-
haust bangings only grew louder

  in third gear the backfire modified
somewhat but continued an intermit-
tent barrage as mr bottle drove
through the sleepy suburban business
section toward the station and five
minutes later with many grave mis-
givings mr bottle pulled up and
parked at the curb in front of the small
suburban depot

  the train arrived at precisely 
and mr bottle waiting on the plat-
form had no trouble in identifying
mrs dushong from the fifteen or
twenty passengers who got off

  she was a tall gray-haired severe
woman she wore pince-nez glasses
a chalk stripe business suit of gray
worsted and carried a briefcase under
her arm two redcaps followed re-
spectfully with her luggage

  mr bottle advanced toward her
identified himself mumbled some
standard banalities and directed the
redcaps to pegasus where they piled
her luggage in the trunk

  on getting into the car mrs du-
shong asked mr bottle what line
are you in she used the same tone
in which a man might ask another
have a cigar

  starting up the car mr bottle be-

gan to explain what line he was in and
was immediately drowned out by the
shattering backfire blasts let loose by
pegasus

  mrs dushong looked at mr bottle
rather sharply but didnt try to shout
above the din as they rolled out into
the street it was then that mr bottle
really began to encounter difficulty
pegasus providing said difficulty of
course

  it was the steering wheel again
liquid twirling aimlessly in mr bot-
tles hands as he tried futilely to direct
the machine

  pegasus was going where it wanted
to go going with a constant and deaf-
ening accompaniment of backfire ex-
plosions and following its chosen
course none too steadily

  pegasus was weaving

  not weaving wildly or dangerously
just definitely skeetering from side to
side enough so that it was noticeable

linging to the futile steering
wheel mr bottle endeavored to
keep a smile on his mouth and an ex-
pression of calm on his face both
efforts were taut and the expression
on the face of mrs dushong was one
of growing annoyance

  mr bottle was wondering where in
the hell they would end up and what
in the hell he should do about the sit-
uation he couldnt turn to mrs du-
shong and tell her to leap for her life
because the car was alive he couldnt
clamber out himself and leap leaving
the woman alone in the mad machine
it was at this point in mr bottles
wildly hysterical musings that mrs
dushong managed to shout above the
din of a backfire blast

  are you driving to your home by
the shortest route mr bottle the
woman demanded -

  thought youd want to see the


fantastic adventures

town mr bottle shouted in the mid-
dle of what unfortunately happened
to be a second of silence

  i am rather tired mrs dushong
told him sharply i would prefer see-
ing your little suburb tomorrow
please drive directly to your home
and pegasus at that instant chose
to come to an abrupt stop

  frantically mr bottle kicked the
starter there was absolutely no re-
sponse and then looking past mrs
dushongs disapproving face mr
bottle saw the store in front of which
pegasus had decided to stop

 royal liquor company
bonded ryes and bour-
bons was the sign across the front
window of the store and piled high
in the window were innumerable ex-
hibits of bottled delights

  mrs dushongs voice came to mr
bottle icily

  have you any particular purpose
in stopping here mr bottle

  mr bottle giving up his efforts to
rouse pegasus to life again swallowed
hard he turned a strained face to
mrs dushpng

  i ah just remembered a very im-
portant call i forgot to make i ah
hope you dont mind my running in
there to put it through it aaahhh
was the nearest place with a phone
booth that i could think of

  mrs dushong didnt answer but
the look she gave bottle was sufficient
redly mr bottle clambered out of
pegasus and went around to the side-
walk by now he felt quite certain
why pegasus had taken him here and
why the automobile had weaved and
backfired so it was that damned
bourbon hed poured into pegasus in
front of his house

  the stuff had made pegasus tight

  and now the car had hauled him
here to the biggest liquor store in the

village and stopped refusing to budge
an inch until mr bottle filled it up
with another quart of bourbon

  mr bottle teetered weakly into the
liquor store made his purchase the
clerk began to swathe the bottle in
paper

  dont bother to wrap it mr bot-
tle said and then at the clerks sur-
prised expression mr bottle added
unthinkingly i intend to drink it out-
side

  the clerk handed him the un-
wrapped bottle with a long and won-
drously appraising stare mr bottle
took it hid it under his coat and with
a deep breath stepped back out onto
the sidewalk 

jteliberately skirting around
the back of pegasus keeping the
bulge beneath his coat from the eyes
of mrs dushong mr bottle paused
before the gas tank cap and furtively
unscrewed it then he brought forth
the bottle of bourbon removed the
cork and began to pour the contents
into the tank

  looking up mr bottle saw the clerk
of the liquor store peering over the
display stalls in the window at him
the clerks jaw was agape his eyes
bulging

  mr bottle forced a pleasant smile
and nodded greeting the pale face of
the clerk vanished hastily from sight

  when mr bottle after disposing of
the empty bourbon quart climbed back
in behind the wheel of pegasus mrs
dushong met him with a frostily puz-
zled stare

  have you been drinking mr bot-
tle she demanded

  mr bottle summoned up a passable
counterfeit of reproach in his expres-
sion

  why mrs dushong he - ex-
claimed
pegasus plays priorities



  i just thought id ask mrs du-
shong declared with no noticeable thaw
in her voice

  pegasus came to life again just as
mr bottle had expected it would
came to life with a surprising cessa-
tion of backfiring and an almost hap-
pily submissive regard to mr bottles
wishes concerning choice of direction

  the steering wheel was once more
of use and although pegasus lurched
badly once or twice in turns there was
no further evidence of the machines
intoxication as mr bottle drove the
rest of the way home

  but this merely partially reassured
mr bottle pegasus was being nice
because hed acceded to the cars wish
for a drink mr bottle was fully
aware that hed be foolish to count on
absolute obedience from pegasus under
all circumstances and as soon as he
stopped plying the machine with liquor
he knew he could expect more trouble

  nevertheless it was with a deep sigh
of relief that mr bottle drew up be-
fore his home and helped mrs du-
shong and luggage up to the porch

  alice had been waiting and she took
her visitor in tow giving mr bottle a
chance to clump upstairs to his bed-
room for a session of grim brooding

  pacing the floor restlessly mr bot-
tle grappled with the problems pre-
sented by pegasus and as he waged
the bitter mental conflict mr bottle
managed somehow to keep a firm grip
on his sanity for deciding what to
do about an old and trusted sedan
which has suddenly come alive on you
takes no little skill in mental tightrope
walking

  some twenty minutes passed how-
ever with mr bottle still no better
off in regard to any sensible solution
of the utterly impossible situation
and another hour passed in muchhhe
same manner

  alice called up the stairs to him
then informing mr bottle that dinner
was ready and asking him to please
hurry down

  throughout the meal mr bottle had
plenty of time to continue his brain
acrobatics for alice and the dushong
woman carried on a two-way running
discussion of the problems of women
in civilian defense there would have
been little opportunity for mr bottle
to enter into the conversation even had
he desired to do so

  and when the meal ended with alice
and mrs dushong repairing to the
living room mr bottle glumly re-
moved the dinnerware from the dining
room table to the kitchen sink turned
the faucets on the mess and went out
into the back yard to continue his
meditations

  mr bottle felt certain that he
wouldnt be missed for quite a little
while kicking up turf in the back-
yard added nothing to mr bottles
efforts to solve his problem so at last
he decided to take a turn around to
the front of the house and have a look
at pegasus

  for perhaps fully a minute mr bot-
tle stood there at the front of the house
staring sickly at the curb where peg-
asus should have been

  my god he gasped hoarsely
then the damned things gone off
on a bender

pr antic ally mr bottle looked
up and down the street hoping
praying for some sign of the vagrant
vehicle but there was none pegasus
was definitely gone positively among
the missing

  mr bottle thought of running into
the house to announce this fact to
alice then he decided against it
after all alice didnt know the whole
story hell she didnt know any of


fantastic adventures

the story now in front of the frigid
mrs dushong would definitely be no
time to try to tell alice about it

  taking a deep breath and mentally
flipping a coin for directional guidance
mr bottle started down the street to
the right it was all he could do to
keep from breaking into a dead run
all he could do to saunter along at a
moderate pace which would not arouse
the alarm of his neighbors

  at last however when he had left
his own residential district mr bottle
was able to give the pursuit the neces-
sary hysteria of pace it demanded up
and down sideways and alleys mr
bottle sped breathlessly he turned
street corners at full speed hoping to
come unexpectedly on some sign any
sign of pegasus

  it occurred to mr bottle that he
might telephone the police he could
report pegasus as missing probably
stolen they would then be able to
aid him in his search

  but bottle discarded that idea as
soon as it was born for he couldnt
tell the police the story either and
if they found pegasus driverless and
wheeling along some boulevard a nasty
situation would evolve which would in
no way enrich police opinion of mr
bottle himself

  so it was that mr bottle was forced
to carry on his desperate search alone
and after some thirty minutes of it
mr bottle was just beginning to re-
alize what a none too small community
his suburb was after all

  legs weary wind spent mind an-
guished mr bottle finally gained the
suburban business district with still no
trace of pegasus to show for his search-
ing

  it was in a gesture of heartsick de-
spair that mr bottle chose to enter the
first saloon he encountered and there
he ordered a double slug of bourbon

  downing the drink in a gulp mr
bottle clung coughingly to the bar for
temporary support nodded once to the
bartender and staggered out of the
place mr bottles stagger was due
to a burning sensation in his chest and
the worries on his mind he was by
no means intoxicated

  but when he emerged from the tav-
ern he wished he were

  for it was then that pegasus horn
tooting gaily and chassis skittering
wildly from one side of the street to
the other rocketed past the astonished
mr bottle

  pegasus whipped around the nearest
corner on two wheels in the next in-
stant and was lost once more from
sight but the shrilly challenging toot-
ing of the horn kept up until it faded
away some two minutes later

  mr bottle clapped one hand to his
brow and turned around staggering
weakly bafk into the saloon

  another double bourbon mr bot-
tle croaked feebly

  the barkeep mixed it bottle
downed it

  and then through the open door of
the saloon there came the rising un-
mistakable shrill tooting of pegasus
horn once more

tvtr bottle dashed to the door
arriving just in time to see pega-
sus now rocketing in the opposite direc-
tion come once again down the street
in mad pell-mell fashion

  popeyed in terror mr bottle
watched his inebriated automobile take
another corner on two wheels with much
screeching protest from the tires

  mr bottle was turning sickly to re-
enter the saloon when he heard the shrill
sirens of pegasus pursuers

  the police motorcycles three of
them came hell-bent around the corner
and down the street in the direction
pegasus plays priorities



pegasus had taken less than forty sec-
onds before

  oh god groaned mr bottle oh
godohgod

  in no time at all the motorcycle po-
licemen would overtake the pie-eyed
pegasus and then there would be hell
to pay mr bottle shuddered at the
thought and turned back into the
saloon to order another double bourbon

  mr bottle left the saloon ten minutes
and four bourbons later but he still
was not intoxicated mr bottle was
discovering that a good terrible fear
was an extremely sobering factor and
that a man scared half out of his wits
needs three times the ordinary amount
of liquor to get tight

  it was getting dark out now and mr
bottle wandered with a sick sort of in-
decision along a side street of the busi-
ness district his ears figuratively cring-
ing in anticipation of any further shrill
clamor that would indicate pegasus was
still racing around the village at large

  but such sounds were not forthcom-
ing and as minutes passed mr bottle
began to dread the very absence of
them now he feared that the very
tranquility of the atmosphere indicated
that pegasus had been trapped

  mr bottle was in the peculiar posi-
tion of not knowing what in hell he
wanted he couldnt decide which
would be the lesser of two evils pega-
sus capture by police or the cars con-
tinued tear throughout the community

  so deep was mr bottle in this none
too pleasant debate that he almost
failed to see the coy radiator snout of
pegasus peering out at him from an
alley

  and when he did chance to see it he
almost fainted

  pegasus-it could be no other peg-
asus silent and unmoving pegasus
wonderfully tranquil

  perhaps pegasus is sleeping it off

like i did mr bottle thought eagerly
and perhaps ill be able to repay the
favor it did me by bringing it home
during its snooze

  with this in mind mr bottle tip-
toed eagerly down the alley approach-
ing pegasus from the side and the in-
stant he laid his hand on pegasus door-
knob he sensed that he had been cor-
rect in his guess the car had tired of
its toot it was indeed sleeping off the
wages of its sin

  mr bottle opened the door and was
stepping in behind the wheel when the
voice sounded behind him

  you own that car buddy

   mr bottle wheeled to face three red-
necked motorcycle policemen whose ex-
pressions indicated something deeper
than mere annoyance

  before he had time to check himself
mr bottle replied

  yes he told them yes of
course

  that brother said one of the po-
licemen is all we wanta know

  mr bottle felt a pair of handcuffs
snap over his wrists and then he was
seized roughly and hustled along at a
rapid pace   

jhe night court session for which
mr bottle was being held started
at nine pm consequently this left him
no little time in which to pace the stone
floor of his cell and reflect on his woes

  from the very callousness of the mo-
torcycle policemens disregard for his
protestations mr bottle had decided
in advance that he was due for rough
and highly unsympathetic treatment in
the courts

  mr bottle thought only once of call-
ing alice and then he discarded the idea
completely and for good that was all
the poor woman needed to show mrs
dushong what stuff her husband was
made of mr bottle decided bitterly


fantastic adventures

the appointment as president to the
defense civilian womens league or
whatever it was was something alice
had her heart set on and in spite of
his sarcastic comments about it that
morning mr bottle was sincerely pull-
ing for his wifes appointment to the
post if it would make her happy

  no he couldnt call alice to do so
would be to run the risk of the frosty
mrs dushong learning of his plight
what then would the woman think
about assigning alice to a post of such
importance when her husband was a
bum no obviously mrs dushongs
opinion of mr bottle was none too solid
as it was better to be a martyr than to
jeopardize his wifes happiness

  so mr bottle sighed and resigned
himself to scheming over ways and
means to keep his good wife out of this
and mrs dushong unaware of it

  mr bottle had encountered no one
so far who had recognized him in fact
he had the definite impression that al-
though they had checked his license
plates the police thought him nothing
more than an automobile thief who be-
came tight while working at his trade

  as long as they dont know im bot-
tle he reflected there will be no
chance of alice learning of this

  thus having made up his mind on the
course of action he was set to take mr
bottle waited nervously for them to
take him it was less than fifteen min-
utes later when the turnkey opened his
cell door and led him across the street
to the night police court

  the police magistrate proved to be
a gruff bull-doggish individual with a
voice like slag sliding down a tin chute
he had the most baleful glare to his
gaze that mr bottle had ever seen

  well said the magistrate you
bottle

  mr bottle cleared his throat and
spoke his lie

  no sir i am lightfingered lifoo-

sky

  the magistrate tusned to his clerk
the license on that car showed that it
belonged to one harold bottle didnt

it

  the clerk said it did the magis-
trate turned back to bottle

  then what were you doing with
bottles car

  again mr bottle cleared his throat
  i-i stole it your honor

  the magistrate leaned forward
what

  mr bottle repeated

  the magistrate turned to the clerk
add larceny to that charge of drunken
driving speeding and resistance of
officers

  mr bottle gulped resistance of
officers he asked

  of course the magistrate growled
you refused to stop when the motor-
cycle police went after you thats re-
sisting officers

  mr bottle nodded i guess so he
admitted weakly

  the magistrate cleared his throat
am i to understand that you plead
guilty to the charges just read he
asked

  it took all of mr bottles spartan
courage to nod yes

  good said the magistrate lets
get down to business then this court
can handle only thedrunken driving
speeding and resistance to officers
counts the higher courts handle lar-
ceny for which offense you will un-
doubtedly be given five years in the
state penitentiary

jvtr bottle blinked in horror he
hadnt realized that small fact un-
til this moment penitentiary-that was
too high a price for any man to pay for
his wifes appointment as president of
the womens whateveritwas
pegasus plays priorities



  just a moment your honor bottle
stammered i plead not guilty on all
charges im not a thief thats my
own car i am harold bottle

 the police magistrate purpled
what is this he demanded whose
leg do you think youre pulling any-
way

  but i am harold bottle it is my
car

  soooooooo glared the police mag-
istrate perjury eh

  i wasnt sworn in under oath pro-
tested mr bottle who was not totally
ignorant of the law

  contempt of court then the mag-
istrate said promptly i hereby fine
you twenty-five dollars for contempt of
court

 mr bottles shoulders slumped
weakly put it on the bill he said

  well now bottle said the magis-
trate leaning forward now that weve
snatched away the veil and know you
for what you are how do you plead to
the charges of drunken driving

  mr bottle cleared his throat not
guilty he said i was not drunk and
i was not driving that takes care of
the other two charges as well

  not drunk eh sneered the magis-
trate he beckoned to one of the three
motorcycle policemen whod arrested
mr bottle the policeman approached
the bench

  did you arrest this man officer
the magistrate asked

  the policeman nodded yessir

  was there alcohol on his breath at
that time the police magistrate
asked

  you said it the policeman de-
clared

  thank you officer said the magis-
trate he leered at bottle what do
you say to that eh not drunk eh
hah

  mr bottle quailed but i wasnt

drunk id had a few drinks yes but
i was cold sober when-

  the magistrate cut him off thats
what they all say he growled then
and what was that second bit of non-
sense you tried to hand me-that guff
about not driving

  mr bottle spread his palms wide and
put on his most supplicating expression

  i wasnt driving your honor i
swear i wasnt driving the car was
driving itself it was drunk dead
drunk

  the magistrate donned his most sar-
castic expression ahhhh he sneered
i see you werent driving you just
sat in the back seat while the car drove
itself eh

  there were tears in mr bottles eyes
as he begged for justice and belief

  no he said no one was in the
car at all

 jhe few loungers in the night court
snickered glaring the magistrate
banged his gavel heavily down for or-
der he leaned forward again to glare
at bottle

  i have had enough of this this
buffoonery i hereby fine you twenty-
five dollars for drunken driving twen-
ty-five more for speeding while intoxi-
cated ten dollars more for resisting the
officers who demanded you stop-and
he paused for breath an additional
twenty-five dollars for contempt of
court

  eighty-five dollars in fines intoned
the clerk

  plus three dollars costs added the
magistrate

  total eighty-eight dollars due from
defendant harold bottle the clerk
said sing-song fashion

  mr bottle groaned i havent got
it he said

  the magistrate grinned cunningly
ill send an officer with you to your


fantastic adventures

home bottle have your wife give you
the money for the fines

  mr bottle shuddered in horror at
the thought of such a spectacle

  no he declared firmly i wont
bring my wife into this i can bring
you the money monday

  certainly the magistrate agreed
but in the meantime youll sit in the
jailhouse over the weekend he
banged his gavel hard take the pris-
oner to the lockup he shouted

  hands closed on mr bottles arms
and he was turned around and led out
of the courtroom by two police jailers
who walked on either side of him

  the fresh night air hit mr bottles
fevered cheeks as he and his guards
paused a moment at the top of the
courthouse steps gazing at the jail-
house just across the street mr bottle
shuddered at the prospects of spending
forty-eight hours behind bars there
but lifting his chin and squaring his
shoulders bottle started down the steps
with firm tread and clear conscience
realizing that this grim sacrifice was
made solely on behalf of his wifes
right to happiness

  it is a far better thing i do than i
have ever done before mused mr
bottle in the heroic words of sidney
carton going to the guillotine

  huh whats that the guard on his
right asked

  nothing said mr bottle loftily
i was but thinking aloud inciden-
tally he paused to smile cunningly and
extend a folded five dollar bill to his
guard do you think you could send
a telegram for me if i told you what to
say

  the guard plucked the bill from mr
bottles hand before the other guard
could see it sure he said swiftly
whatcha want sent and to who

  mr bottle pausing there on the
sidewalk gave his guard his home ad-

dress and his wifes name

  in the telegram said bottle say
merely called unexpectedly back to
city urgent work see you monday
signed harold

  the guard nodded ill send it right
now he promised to his companion
he said you take care of him joe
ill run down to the telegraph office
right away

  mr bottles remaining guard grum-
bled something under his breath held
tighter to his captives arm and started
to steer mr bottle across the street to
the jailhouse

  mr bottle scarcely noticed that he
was walking so noble did he feel and
so clever at inventing the ingenious ruse
which would keep his wife from worry-
ing and explain his absence to the frosty
mrs dushong

  least of all did mr bottle realize he
was crossing the street and his com-
plete unawareness of the automobile
headlights bearing down on him and
his guard at breakneck speed was the
most conclusive evidence of the trance
he was in

  loooookout  mr bottles guard
screamed shrilly dropping his captives
arm and racing madly for the curb

jvfr bottle came out of the fog
in time to turn and see the head-
lights rushing through the darkness at
him from a distance of less than ten
feet he opened his mouth to scream
but no words came he bent his knock-
ing knees to leap aside but he was
frozen to the spot

  mr bottle closed his eyes and cov-
ered his head with his arms

  there was a mad squealing of brakes
and burning of tires as the automobile
shaved bottle by inches and came to a
stop directly beside him

  mr bottle opened his eyes to see that
the door of the machine was open that
pegasus plays priorities



there was no one in the car or behind
the wheel and that the vehicle was
pegasus

  the next instant was one controlled
by mr bottles sheer instinctive reac-
tions his guards were no longer be-
side him he was a prisoner on his way
to jail escape beckoned temptingly

  mr bottle didnt pause to think he
leaped in behind pegasus steering
wheel and the door slammed automat-
ically behind him while the motor
snarled angrily and the car shot off
down the street in high gear

  his hands were on the steering wheel
and mr bottle was going through all
the motions of driving pegasus as the
machine shot along at breakneck speed
but of course the wheel was once again
quite futilely liquid and pegasus was
racing where it pleased

  for the first three or four blocks of
wild flight mr bottles heart ham-
mered in excitement and he felt the
giddy flush of madcap adventure

  and then as pegasus took a turn on
two wheels at sixty-five miles an hour
mr bottles reason began to return

 ohmygod groaned mr bottle
suddenly what have i done what-
ever have i done

  and cold sanity of course told him
exactly what hed done he had fled
the grip of the law he had accom-
plished a madly spectacular jailbreak

  cold sweat beaded bottles brow
and his heart fluttered butterfly fashion
around in his stomach

  he was an escaped convict nothing
less

  being confined to a suburban jail
for various offenses ranging from
drunken driving to resisting officers was
one thing dashing madly off in what
must certainly have seemed to be a
cleverly executed jailbreak was quite
another it lifted his crimes quite def-
initely from the misdemeanor status

into that of felony or something equal-
ly horrible

  mr bottle wondered sickly what
they did to escaped convicts in his
mind there flashed grim scenes recalled
from movies wherein baying blood-
hounds tracked frantic felons through
swampland wastes he visioned too
the chains lashes and sweatboxes that
waited for the hapless fugitives when
they were at last recaptured

  mr bottle groaned aloud and was
seized by an uncontrollable fit of trem-
bling he buried his hands in his face

  oh pegasus pegasus look what
youve made me do he moaned

  it came to mr bottle after a few
more blocks and an attempt to get a
grip on himself that there was only
one thing for him to do

  i must go back now before it
is too late mr bottle decided i
must throw myself on the mercy of the
jailers perhaps i can tell them i only
went to get a package of cigarettes-
or something

rjphus resolved mr bottle felt a lit-
tle better his hands grabbed the
steering wheel again and in a loud
clear voice he tried to regain mastery
of the car

  pegasus said mr bottle firmly
enough of this nonsense i want to
go back i want you to take me right
back where you picked me up under-
stand	

   but if pegasus understood it wasnt
having any the car continued to race
madly onward while the speedometer
flickered around seventy-five miles an
hour

   mr bottle tried turning the steering
wheel this way and that but of course
it was no use the thing was still liq-
uid in his hands he might as well not
have tried

  pegasus mr bottle shouted more
	fantastic adventures

shrilly pegasus stop this instant
if you wont take me back im getting
out right now

  as if in answer the speedometer
inched up to eighty miles an hour mr
bottle went pale

  pegasus he shrilled

  and before mr bottles horrified
eyes the speedometer went all the way
up to ninety miles an hour-something
it hadnt seemed able to do since the
first year mr bottle had owned it

  pegasus had left the business dis-
trict now and was taking a route which
mr bottle knew led to the main high-
way the terrain was flying past them
now as the machine thundered along
the streets

  mr bottle had to reach his grim de-
cision in a hurry there was little time
to dally at the rate pegasus was flying

  ill have to leap mr bottle
groaned its my only chance

  several times mr bottle reached for
the door handle and each time a flash-
ing vision of houses and lightpoles
flicking past them made him hesitate in
terror leaping frqm a machine thun-
dering along at ninety miles an hour is
something to give any man pause

  but courage came at last to mr bot-
tle and closing his eyes he seized hard
on the door handle and gave it a vicious
twist downward

  the twist almost broke mr bottles
wrist and the door handle didnt give
an inch frantically mr bottle tried
again this time with both hands there
was the same result

  wildly mr bottle threw himself
across the car seat and grabbed for the
opposite door handle with almost in-
human strength born of his despera-
tion mr bottle tried to force that
handle down

  it was useless sobbing mr bottle
clambered back behind the steering
wheel he was trapped pegasus was

deliberately refusing to let him out
those handles had never been stuck
before he knew that it would be fool-
ish even to try the handles of the rear
doors

  pegasus had obviously made up its
mind that mr bottle wasnt leaving

  they reached the highway fork now
and unhesitatingly pegasus rocketed
through a red-light narrowly avoided
collision with a huge truck that had the
right of way and thundered on along
the broad concrete stretch

  pegasus was heading toward the
bright lights of the city

tortunately there were few

   cars on the road for pegasus to play
tag with there were few cars that is
until pegasus reached another highway
crossing and a long sleek black sedan
obviously in a hell of a hurry and trav-
eling at a right angle to them made a
sharp screeching two-wheeled turn
onto their stretch of highway and thun-
dered along some two hundred yards
ahead of them in the same direction

  a red flag might as well have been
waved under the nose of a bull pega-
sus thundered angrily at the sight of
the other machine now racing onward
ahead of them thundered angrily
and picked up speed

  mr bottle blanched the speedom-
eter was crawling up to a hundred
miles an hour it was impossible for
a car of pegasus years to attain such
a speed utterly impossible but the
needle flickered steadily upward

   pegasus intention was obvious the
car ahead provided a challenge and
pegasus was accepting it sportively it
was going to be a race

  mr bottle cringed down behind the
dashboard expecting each instant to
hear the terrible rending of one of
pegasus worn tires or the snapping
of a vital part
pegasus plays priorities



  when he peered up through the
windshield again two minutes later
they had gained almost a hundred
yards on the car ahead

  and then fearing to look at the
speedometer mr bottle turned his
head away and caught his first glimpse
of the speeding automobile behind
them

  it too was a long black fast limou-
sine and it was some two hundred
yards back of them falling behind a
little each second as pegasus picked up
speed

  and when mr bottle turned back to
look through the front windshield
again they were less than fifty yards
behind the car ahead of them

  it was then that mr bottle noticed
that there seemed to be five or six men
in that car and that several of them
were peering intently through the rear
window at pegasus approach

  mr bottle was wondering about this
when one of the men opened the rear
window and the second one stuck out
a stick and pointed it at them

  in less than two seconds later mr
bottle was aware that the stick was
spitting flame through the darkness at
them and that the stick was not a stick
but a gun of some sort mr bottle
digested this in open-mouthed amaze-
ment

  the crashing of the first shots
through pegaus windshield brought
home to mr bottle the awful fact that
he was the target of the fire

  mr bottle then acted on sheer in-
stinct he clambered over the seat and
into the back of the car where he lay
trembling on the floor

  the shots were louder and more fre-
quent now and mr bottle realized
that pegasus must be almost within a
few feet of the other machine

  curiosity is also an instinct and it
prompted mr bottle to raise his head

  ever so cautiously to the window level
of the car

  and then mr bottle saw that they
were directly behind the other machine
and moving up in an effort to run side
by side with it he saw from close
range the face of the man holding
the gun

  it was an ugly face a frightening
face hard and foreign in cast but it
was also a face that was considerably
frightened

  the face turned away and shouted
something up to the men in the front
seat and then pegasus in a neat
spurt drew around and up alongside
the other machine

  mr bottle had forgotten to duck
down again and so he saw the whole
panorama

  there were six men in the car and
they all had the same hard frightening
casts to their features as the one with
the gun and like the first one bottle
had seen they too were white with
fright

  all of them were staring open-
mouthed in terror at pegasus five of
them had guns which they held foolish-
ly in their hands making no effort to
fire them

and then mr bottle realized the
reason for their terrified alarm it
was pegasus and himself of course
the fact that pegasus was speeding
along merrily with absolutely no visible
hand in the front seat to guide it while
its sole passenger crouched in the back
peering out the window at them
enough to terrify the hardest of indi-
viduals

  what happened then happened
swiftly

  the car alongside of them went ap-
parently out of control as its driver
looked too long at pegasus and not long
enough at the road ahead


fantastic adventures

  mr bottle saw it start to veer wildly
off into the ditch beside the road saw
the frantic efforts of the others in the
car trying all at once to grab the wheel
and right the machine efforts which
only served to speed its course into the
ditch

  and even as the other car crashed off
the road into the ditch and started the
sickening roll over and over through
the weeds toward a telephone post
pegasus blew a tire

  pegasus then in the next split sec-
ond was skeetering toward the ditch
some ten yards in front of the machine
that had already plunged into it

  mr bottle shouted wildly grabbing
instinctively for the rear door handle
and then there was a bouncing jarring
twisting chaos and mr bottle was re-
leasing his hold on the handle of the
open rear door and flying through the
air toward a clump of thorn bushes

  the thorn bushes and mr bottles
nether extremities cushioned his fall-
a most unhappy combination dazed
yowling wildly mr bottle scrambled
from the bushes and slid down into the
ditch

  standing there mr bottle looked
around in horror pegasus lay in a
twisted mass of wreckage against a
telephone pole some fifty yards ahead
the limousine which had gone off into
the ditch before pegasus had found a
closer pole and lay smoulderingly
twined around it its occupants were
evidently trapped inside

  and then the car which mr bottle
had seen racing along behind them
came screeching to a stop on the high-
way directly beside mr bottle doors
opened and men piled out grim reso-
lute clean-cut young men carrying sub-
machine guns in their arms they
swarmed around bottle

  great work old man tremendous-
ly courageous stuff we saw it all

wed never have caught these devils if
you hadnt come along they were
pulling away from us all the time

  mr bottle didnt know what it was
all about but he pointed a frightened
finger at the twisted wreckage of the
sleek sedan

  theyre still in there he said

  some of the grim young men set
about the task of pulling the occupants
of the wrecked limousine forth from
the remains of their car

  youve done the fbi a turn that
wont be forgotten one of the young
men told bottle

  fbi choked mr bottle g
men

  the young man nodded of course
that bunch you overtook and ran off
the road is the nastiest band of sabo-
teurs operating in this part of the coun-
try

  saboteurs mr bottle gasped

  the young man nodded thats
right he said for this youll be
something of a hero

  mr bottle collapsed in a heap   

 he young fbi man was correct

  mr bottle did indeed become
something of a hero the suburban
paper ran a sunday extra featuring his
picture above the tale of his exploit
alice of course floated on a cloud of
sheer ecstasy

  even mrs dushong was impressed
and her attitude toward mr bottle
changed to one of respectful awe nat-
urally alice got the presidency of the
womens civilian whatchamacallet

  pegasus was carted off to the junk
heap which mr bottle visited stealth-
ily at night in order to place a small
wreath atop the shattered remains

  and the matter of mr bottles be-
ing without a car was quite handsomely
rectified the government presented
him with a sleek new  super-de-
pegasus plays priorities



luxe sedan after ordering the priorities
people to place him number one on
their local list

  and this new car mr bottle deter-
mined to treat kindly but without
pampering for he was far too well

aware of the danger involved in allow-
ing a mere automobile the attention de-
served only by humans such treat-
ment made them only too apt to get out
of hand

fantastic facts

artificial hibernation

that many warm-blooded animals hiber-
nate in the late fall and sleep until spring
is a well known fact it is very interesting
to note therefore the results obtained by dr
paavo suomalainen a finnish scientist who has
been able to send european hedgehogs into hiber-
nation artificially he discovered that an injec-
tion of insulin or a combination of insulin and
magnesium chloride in the hedgehogs produced a
drop in their blood sugar content to about half
of the normal content

  this condition is characteristic of the cold-
blooded state of warm-blooded animals during
hibernation-and so the animals went to sleep
moreover if they were kept at temperatures near
the freezing point the animals continued to sleep
just as in natural hibernation but just as soon
as they were taken into a room where the tem-
perature was from  to  degrees f the animals
awoke and returned to their normal warm-
blooded state

can still buy an a-l skull with natural teeth for

  bald men more masculine

t ost people believe that a man with a lot
of hair is a real he-man but according
to dr james b hamilton of the yale university
school of medicine baldness in a man is a sign
of real masculinity instead of extreme hairiness
at least after the earliest years are over

  dr hamilton conducted his research on bald-
ness by studying a large group of men who had
been rendered sexless through accidents or nec-
cessary surgery or who had not matured sexually
out of fifty-four permanently immature cases
not one had a bald head moreover the men had
less dandruff than normal males

  when male sex hormone was injected in some
of these men they began to lose their hair and
develop dandruff in two cases the treatment
was discontinued and the loss of hair stopped
just as soon as the treatment was repeated the
loss of hair resumed
the incredible antique

by bruce demis

         as far as gifts so this antique was a
         perfect gesture-for a mother-in-law

theres an ancient adage to the
effect that a man with a hobby
is a chap youll never find flirting
with trouble and like all such saws
it is about as accurate as the latest bit
of hogwash from the third reich

  any hobby no matter how harmless
it may seem apparently is a perfect
passkey to a closet full of trouble i
ought to know for my own hobby al-
though just about as mild and gentle as

any collecting mania known to man
turned out to be-

  well maybe id better start at the
beginning   

  it was the afternoon the two roman
battle shields had arrived and id hung
them up in the dining-room and my
wife gwen had raised such a hellish
stink

  you can take those monstrosities
up in the attic and pile them with the

children screamed women
fainted the cry of witch-
craft rang through the air



fantastic adventures

rest of your junk tom hastings
gwen exploded when she saw them

  but they are ancient roman battle
shields i said with thin patience
they date back to the days of julius
caesar and maybe further 

  i dont care if theyre the second-
hand fig leaves of adam and eve
gwen shrilled get them out of my
dining-room

  as i grimly began their removal
from the dining-room wall gwen came
up behind me to watch after a min-
ute in a small tight voice she asked
and how much did you pay for these
ancient roman thingamahjigs

  theyd be cheap at twice the price
i answered evasively

  how much were they gwen asked
determinedly

  twenty-five dollars i muttered
twenty-five dollars for those hide-
ous blobs of metal

  twenty-five dollars apiece i cor-
rected her gently

  fifty dollars gwen sounded as if
id just informed her casually that id
been living a bigamous existence for
the ten years of our marriage

  i continued to take down the shields
as the silence curled into a nice tense
ball of dynamite

  then at last my spouse said in soft
horror do you realize what fifty dol-
lars would buy

  i leaned the shields against the di-
ning-room table fifty dollars would
buy a hundred stingers or five hundred
beers i said trying to put the light
touch into the conversation

  but gwen wasnt having any of it
she stared at me aghast then she
glanced in incredulous dismay at the
shields i could see that she was on
the verge of the weeps

  fifty dollars would buy mother
that new spring coat shes had her heart
set on gwen said tremulously the

tears were gathering in her lovely gray
eyes and i knew that id be in for it if
i didnt head her off somehow

  you didnt tell me anything about
your mothers wanting a new spring
coat i said swiftly

  i-i didnt mention it because i
didnt think we could afford it gwen
said her underlip beginning to tremble
the first tear was starting down her
cheek

  now listen honey i told her all
you had to do was mention it just
mention it to me and id have written
a check for her coat then and there
you go in and tell your mother she can
have the coat

  the tears stopped temporarily at
least

  mother has gone out to the hair-
dressers gwen said but ill tell
her the moment she comes home

  thats fine i said now what
about these shields how about that
spot over my desk in the study

rthe glint came back to gwens eyes

  she shook her head firmly

  take them up into the attic tom
they have no placg around this house
and another thing i want to talk to
you about all this

  about all what i asked suspi-
ciously

  about your collecting its just
about time that we settle it once and
for all

  what i demanded is there to
settle

  its sending us to the poorhouse
tom it will just have to stop we
have an attic cluttered up with antique
knickknacks which youve collected
over ten years theres hardly any
room for them and they just lie up
there gathering dust mother and i
decided that it would be a wonderful
thing if youd get rid of them all sell
the incredible antique



them to another collector and stop this
nonsense

  at last it was becoming clear mother
and gwen how ducky how too too
nice it wasnt enough that my dear
sweet uncomplaining mother-in-law
had maneuvered me into a new spring
coat promise she had also been at her
favorite topic with gwen again-the
extravagance of my hobby i began to
do a slow burn

  listen weve covered this ground
before it is all too familiar your
mother would please me greatly by
minding her own business i like col-
lecting antiques even if no one around
this damned house has brains enough
to understand the value of them when
the day comes that your mother isnt
getting enough to eat around here or
cant have two new coats on me each
year she can start worrying about my
personal expenditures 

  gwen gave me a shocked hurt stare
  tom she gasped why tom

  i picked up the shields and started
for the stairs behind me i could hear
gwen beginning to sob i knew that
she expected me to drop the shields and
race madly back to her side to apologize
profusely but i continued toward the
attic

  that was perhaps the sixth time in
ten years of marriage that id ever
sounded off to gwen about her mother
and gwens mother had been with us
ever since we returned from our honey-
moon ten years ago if i recall cor-
rectly she came to help gwen get the
house in order just for the first few
weeks shed stayed with us ever since

  the common conception of a mother-
in-law is a big ample-bossomed thun-
der-voiced dominating woman at least
thats the way they are in movies and
comic strips but gwens mother is
nothing of the sort she is by far the
most insidious variety of mother-in-law

imaginable she is small demure
sweet-faced and gray haired she just
wouldnt think of trying to run things
she only suggests sweetly and without
apparent malice give me the movie
and comic strip variety any day

  when i came down from the attic i
could hear gwen in our bedroom she
was still sobbing but i was damned if
id go in there and recant i slammed
around in the hall looking for my hat
and then i got the car out of the garage
and raced the motor defiantly as i drove
past beneath her bedroom window

  a long drive in the country usually
served as my refuge from mother-in-
law trouble and so i headed out for
open highway the minute i reached the
outskirts of town once on the broad
white concrete stretches i didnt pay
much attention to where i was going i
just drove and let the air swoosh in
through the side-window vent and cool
off my face and my emotions

phen i came to the little wayside
village that had the big roadhouse
with the neon sign advertising a popu-
lar brand of beer i decided to stop
for a few drinks

  the bartender in the roadhouse made
excellent stingers and after about six
or seven of them i decided to head back
home i was buzzing most pleasantly
when i stepped out into the sunlight
and noticed for the first time that there
was a ramshackle little store across the
road that brought all my troubles back
to mind

  the sign out in front of the little
store read

antiques for sale

  i put my car keys back into my
pocket and crossed the road

  the windows of the little shop were
cluttered with the usual array of spin-
ning wheels and other standard antique
items but that didnt stop me you can


fantastic adventures

never tell whats inside

  the shop was dark almost dingy
and had that marvelous musty smell
to it that affects a collector the same
way smoke does a fireman a bell
jangled as i opened the door and
stepped inside and a prim long nosed
bald headed little man came out from
the back as i stood there looking
around

  how do you do he asked

  i told him i did pretty well consid-
ering and mentioned my curiosity at
finding this little shop like i did he
agreed that it wasnt generally well
known but said that he had a pretty
steady trade of collectors coming from
the city every weekend

  we got to talking and he showed me
some things which had just been
shipped to him in a load from new eng-
land some of them were interesting
enough others run of the mill i was
beginning to get a little bit disappointed
at not finding anything that struck my
fancy to the extent of making me want
to buy it when the little shopkeeper
said

  a very interesting thing cajne in
with this last shipment it wasnt clas-
sified and ive found myself at a loss
to figure out exactly what its origin was
perhaps you might know would you
like to see it

  yes sure by all means where
is it

  back this way the little shop-
keeper said waving his hand toward
the rear of the store

  i followed him to a particularly poor-
ly lighted corner in the back where he
pulled something out from an assort-
ment of dusty furniture

  it was a chair

  specifically it wasnt quite a chair
it was sort of a stool with arms on it
it had four spindly legs and was about
as high as the ordinary straight backed

chair you have in your dining-room it
was well worn but the wood seemed
still tough and undecayed

  it was an ugly piece but it was fas-
cinating

  i got that love-at-first-sight feeling
peculiar to antique collectors and auto-
matically reached for my wallet i
knew i was hooked the little shop-
keeper was bending over it and com-
menting on design and period and a lot
of other technical appraisal but i was
scarcely listening to him i was staring
at the chair and the chair seemed to be
staring at me

  so you see said the little shop-
keeper i am quite at a loss to say ex-
actly where it fits

  eh i was startled hows that
oh yes sure i see what you mean
i agree with you its a puzzler i
dont quite think i could make any
guesses at it myself but i like it have
you price tagged it yet

 yhe shopkeeper saw that id taken
out my wallet naturally he was
startled collectors dont run around
picking up pieces about which they
know admittedly nothing he gave me
a shrewd glance

  are you sure you cant classify it
sir

  i shook my head positive beyond
a rough guess at new england maybe
sixteenth century i couldnt say fur-
ther

  but surely sir the little man pro-
tested you dont want to buy a piece
that has such an uncertain origin do
you wouldnt you care to wait until
i write the shipper and find out what
he knows about it

  again i shook my head i just like
the damned ugly thing i said i want
it now ill take it along with me
whats your price

  i hadnt been shrewd stupidly id
the incredible antique



aroused the shopkeepers suspicions
perhaps he thought id realized some-
thing especially significant and valuable
about the ugly little chair at first sight
maybe he figured i was trying to hood-
wink him out of a valuable piece at
any rate his answer almost knocked my
hat off

   a hundred and fifty dollars sir

  what

  a hundred and fifty dollars the
shopkeeper repeated firmly

  i waved my hand in disgust no
sale why should i pay such a price
for an unclassified piece

  the shopkeeper shrugged i am
only trying to protect myself against
the possibility that it might have great
value

  i started toward the door suit
yourself youre only talking yourself
out of a sale

  he saw that i wasnt bluffing

  what price would you think fair
sir he said following quickly after
me

  i stopped thirty dollars i said

  the shopkeeper locked pained i
will let it go for a hundred he said

  thirty bucks i repeated starting
toward the door again

  the little shopkeeper took a nimble
two-step after me he plucked at my
sleeve and i stopped again

  eighty dollars sir that should be
fair

  im wasting my time i told him
and my money but ill give you
forty

   fifty said the little shopkeeper

  fifty bucks i thought fifty bucks
five hundred beers a hundred
stingers a new spring coat for my
mother-in-law the last suggestion
did it

  okay i said fifty bucks wrap
it up ill take it along

  the shopkeeper beamed   

yyhen at last i emerged from the
tiny antique shop it was with the
chair in my arms-all wrapped and
paid for i had to cross the road again
to get to my car and my car was
parked right beside the roadhouse and
this was a little bit of an event this
purchase of a new piece and the road-
house had good stingers and- i
went in

  the lights were all on in my house
when i got home a fact i thought
damned peculiar inasmuch as it was
almost midnight gwen and her mother
made a practice of hitting the downy
never later than ten pm it never oc-
curred to me that id been gone more
than eight hours missed dinner and
never even called it never occurred
to me that the lights were so gaily aglow
all because of yours truly

  i had fallen halfway up the front
porch steps before i remembered that
id left the chair in the back of the car
it was easier falling down the steps
than up and pretty soon id tugged the
antique from the back cushions and
was well on my way to getting it up
the steps

  the front door opened then and i
looked up to see gwen standing there
hands on hips the expression on her
face was just about what youd expect
under the circumstances only worse

  well gwen said she ground the
word out between her teeth then spat
it at me

  whatre all the lights doing on
mlove having a party i asked
brightly at that moment my feet
betrayed me and got tangled in the
chair i just made the porch in my
sprawling lurch saving my new posses-
sion from what would otherwise have
been a splintering crash

  what do you have there besides
an alcoholic fog gwen demanded
voice rising


fantastic adventures

  shhhhh i put the chair down
looking carefully around the streets
the neighbors do you want them
to hear

  i dont care what they hearl  gwen
grated

  but if they knew how damned good
i felt i giggled they might get in-
sanely jealous

  i picked up the chair in my arms and
started through the door gwen moved
to one side staring at me as if decid-
ing on which side of my skull she was
going to bury the axe

  and then i saw her mother

  quiet sweet-faced sad-eyed and oh-
so-glad to have the chance to be
shocked she stood in the living room
staring out at me as if i were jack
the ripper through special permission
of atilla the hun

  mother-in-law i bellowed joy-
ously

  gwens mother retreated several
steps looking for all the world as if she
expected my next move to be an at-
tempt at murder

  i brought you a present  i boomed
happily the neatest little gift you
ever saw its an antique i know
how well you love antiques

  gwen had followed me into the liv-
ing room where id put down the chair
and was starting to remove the wrap-
pings

  you drunken bum she said

  i paused to smile sweetly at her
but of course i went back to un-
wrapping the chair

  no one said a word i could hear
gwens incredulous gasp and her
mothers shocked but happy squeal of
horror then i tore the last wrappings
from my object dart i stepped back
from it with a rapturous sigh of ad-
miration and waved my hand in a
sweeping gesture

  regard i told them my chair 

 jhere wasnt a word you could
  have skated on the silence

  i looked first at gwen her jaw
was grim her eyes flashed sparks like
a welders torch

  this is the end she said grimly
this is absolutely the last repulsive
bit of furniture you are ever going to
drag into this house

  i looked at her mother her face
was wreathed in good and kindliness
and firm disapproval she wouldnt
have missed this scene for all the world
it was her moment tomorrow she
could tell gwen sweetly that she had
told her so all along

  well i demanded well what
do you think

  gwens mother shook her head
sadly

  i am afraid you have been drinking
heavily thomas i have never been so
shocked in all my life but tomorrow
when you are ah feeling better i will
accept your apology for this conduct
although ie added you cannot ex-
pect me to plead with gwen for you
this time

  that was almost too much plead
with gwen the old hypocrite was in-
sinuating that shed saved me from
many a marital smashup by her kindly
intercession i just gaped at her with
my mouth open

  gwen spoke up

  mother she said grimly would
you leave me here with tom i dont
want you to have to stand this dis-
graceful scene

  my dear sweet mother-in-law was
obviously reluctant to go she looked
from gwen to me to the chair

  dont you need my help gwen
dear she asked

  yes i piped up be sure to stick
around i might beat your daughter at
any moment

  gwens mother gave me a sad disap-
the incredible antique



pointed look she shook her head
sighing

  obviously thomas doesnt know
what hes saying she told gwen but
i will be in my room if you need me
dear she turned and made a laven-
der-and-old-lace exit

  gwen turned on me then with both
barrels

  youve heard the routine working
fingers to the bone slaving and toil-
ing to make ends meet best years of
life what she ever saw in me
drunken cad impossible bounder
this is the end leaving tomorrow
it took five miuutes and she was
breathless when she finished

  ill help you pack i volunteered
sweetly

  gwen glared at me in astonishment
and indignation then she stamped
out of the room

  i turned back to the chair patting
it kindly on the back

  only friend left in the world i
mumbled i pulled it around and sat-
down-on the floor

  i remember feeling extremely glad
that both gwen and her mother were no
longer in the room had they wit-
nessed that chair-missing sequence
theyd have been even more firmly con-
vinced that i was tighter than goerings
girdle

  i scrambled quickly to my feet look-
ing sheepishly around to make certain
i hadnt been seen

  then i sat down again-on the floor

  i got up more slowly this time
steady there i told myself you
arent that drunk you couldnt be
that drunk youve just got a little
glow on thats all just a little glow
take your time on this one

  i put one hand on the back of the
chair then eased myself around slowly
to a sitting position suspended sev-
eral inches above the chair seat then

i released my grip on the back and sat
down-on the floor

  this time i knew why the chair
had moved

t sat there on the floor gaping at it

  incredulously as i realized what had
happened the chair had moved
the chair had moved each time id tried
to sit down in it moved just enough
to plank me on the floor

  of course if it hadnt been for that
little glow i was feeling all my com-
mon sense would have come to the fore
to assure me that the chair couldnt
have moved of its own accord if id
been completely cold sober it would
have taken me much longer to digest
the incredible truth of the matter

  but now sitting there on the floor
and staring up wide-eyed at the chair
i had absolutely no doubt as to what
had actually happened the impossi-
bility of the thing never occurred to
me

  i got up slowly now cautiously i
stepped back warily keeping my eye
on it

     once twice i circled it airily
nonchalantly as if i didnt have the
slightest idea in the world of trying
to sit down on it it made me think
of that march-around-the-chair game
going to jerusalem we used to play
when we were kids

  then i stepped in quickly grabbed
the back of the chair tightly with both
hands swung it around and planked
myself down hard-just as it literally
wrenched itself from my grasp and shot
away sidewards

  i landed on the floor

  for a moment i was too stunned to
comprehend what had happened miss-
ing a chair which skeeters as youre
trying to sit on it is one thing feel-
ing it yank itself free of your grasp is
quite another


fantastic adventures

  i must have been making quite a
little noise for now i heard voices
gwens and her mothers coming from
upstairs i put my head in my hands
took a deep breath and got a grip on
my sanity then i looked up at the
chair again

  there it was planked at least four
feet away from the spot where id held
it when trying to sit down

  maybe it was just my imagination
but id swear the damned thing was
leering at me

  very slowly i got up off the floor i
went over to the divan found a ciga-
rette on the coffee table and lighted it
then sat down it felt marvelous to be
able to sit down on something that
didnt mind

  the voices upstairs had died down
and i heard a door slam hard i knew
that gwen by way of going home to
mother was spending the night in her
mothers room

  but i wasnt concerned with any of
that now the chair was by far the
greatest object of my concern i got
up again and walked casually over to
it half expecting it to shy away at my
approach

  it didnt however and i was able to
place my hand gently on its back
slowly ever so tenderly i turned it
around so that it faced me i took my
hand from it then and turned away-
as if to start back to the divan-then
wheeled madly and planked my nether
extremities frantically on the seat of
the chair or where the seat of the
chair should have been

  once more i found myself sitting on
the floor i didnt have to look to
know that the chair had skipped aside
again i was finally convinced the
chair would not tolerate being sat on

  enough was enough i was begin-
ning to ache all over and one place in
particular if the chair didnt want me

sitting in it it didnt want me sitting
in it that was that

  but in spite of my somewhat alco-
holic glow i was very well aware that
it was the damnedest impossible situa-
tion i had ever encountered i got up
and went over to the divan and sat
down again gratefully a sort of
moody chill was stealing over me

j sat there for perhaps half an hour
smoking cigarettes and staring at
the chair and wondering what in the
hell this was all about and where it
was going to end

  my glow was fading fast now and
i knew that it was the single factor
which had kept me from becoming ac-
tually afraid of my newly bought an-
tique there was a very simple solu-
tion to this however so i called a
nearby liquor store and ordered a fifth
of my favorite

  the delivery boy arrived with the
stuff inside of ten minutes and i was
recapturing my glow inside of another
fifteen another half hour passed and
i was developing a belligerent attitude
toward the chair i was finding that i
could look it squarely in the eye-so to
speak-without a tremor or chill

  what makes you think youre better
than any other chair i would demand
loudly at five minute intervals

  a chair is to sit in hasnt anyone
ever told you i growled between
drinks if you expect to stay around
here youre going to have to learn your
playsh

  shilly damn attitoosh i decided
still fifteen minutes later  fraid of a
lil damn chair

  i remember vaguely that that was
about the time that i became physically
belligerent i must have tried to hurl
myself into the chair on at least a dozen
occasions after that the thumping and
cries and shouting as each succeeding
the incredible antique



effort failed must have been terrific i
know that the bruises on my body the
following morning certainly were

  the rest of the events are too hazy
to try to recall precisely maudlin
emotion took command of me a little
later i know and i wept bitterly be-
fore the chair demanding to know
what it had against me insisting that
i was a good fellow and trying to buy
it a drink there must have been
more efforts on my part to sit in it
and additional loud crashes as i failed

  and then of course everything
blotted into an indistinguishable pat-
tern    until the following morn-
ing   

   wens voice was saying some-
thing and i opened my eyes to
see that she was standing over me and
that i was in my own room and in bed
the expression on her face was alarm-
ingly peculiar she was smiling sweet-
ly tenderly

  how do you feel dear gwen
asked

  i looked at her with bloodshot eyes
my head was splitting and the twin
demons of hangovers nausea and re-
morse were in complete command of
my body and brain

  rotten i groaned

  silly boy gwen said you just
had a little too much to drink

  i tried to sit up but i couldnt raise
my head gwen handed me a glass of
something and i took it feebly

  drink it down dear she said

  what is it i groaned

  milk and gingerale it always
picks you up

  with shaking hand i managed to
raise the glass to my lips without spill-
ing too much of it over the covers and
gulped it down i handed her the
glass and stretched back on the pillow
again

  whats up i moaned why are
you being so sweet to me

  gwens smile was honey mother
and i talked everything over and we
agreed that one of us must have done
something to hurt you terribly to make
you act the way you did last night
she paused we agreed to let bygones
be bygones and start with a clean slate
for all of us

  it was beyond my powers of concen-
tration i was too sick too weak to
figure it out

  do you want me to take your little
friend out of bed and downstairs
gwen asked with a sweet understand-
ing smile

  my heart did a terrible flip-flop
what i choked hoarsely turning
my aching skull far enough to look be-
side me and then i saw it tucked
neatly under the covers its top resting
on the pillow next to mine the chair

  you must have grown enormously
fond ofr your chair last night gwen
laughed kindly

  i closed my eyes and shuddered the
memory of my unsuccessful battle to
seat myself in the chair returned

  ill get up in a little while i mut-
tered ill be all right leave the
chair here

  are you sure there isnt anything i
can do for you dear gwen asked

  i shook my head and it almost fell
off

  no ill be all right

  will you want breakfast gwen
asked

  i was smart enough not to try to
shake my head no i muttered
chilled by the thought no ill get
along without breakfast

  it was then that my mother-in-law
poked her head into my room

  well well she simpered sweetly
are you feeling bad thomas

  i turned red eyes on her but didnt


fantastic adventures

answer gwen moved to the door

  whenever you feel like it dear get
up she said if you want anything
just call

  i groaned an affirmative answer and
she left i could hear her voice and
that of her mothers murmuring con-
versationally as they went downstairs
then i turned my head for another
look at the chair

tn the cold light of morning it seemed

  peaceable enough aside from the
fact that it looked rather ludicrous
tucked neatly under the sheets there
seemed nothing about it which would
indicate its peculiar aversion to being
sat upon in fact it looked like noth-
ing more than an antique chair

  i began to wonder just how drunk
id really been i knew that i could
recall most of the nights events with
fair clarity but such recollection wasnt
any guarantee that i hadnt been boiled
enough to have imagined that the chair
wouldnt let me sit in it i could think
of at least three or four occasions when
id been certain that i was fairly sober
only to find out later that my own esti-
mate of my lucid poise was greatly at
variance with that of the people whod
been with me

  somehow i managed to get up i
stood there clutching the bedpost while
the inside of my head pounded like
kettle drums and the room seemed to
sway madly back and forth and then
a small degree of steadiness returned
the pick-me-up which gwen had been
thoughtful enough to provide was tak-
ing hold

  in the bathroom i gargled noisily
eliminating the wads of cotton which
had grown beneath my tongue then a
cold brisk shower a vigorous scalp
massage which threatened to tear off
the top of my head and a none too
steady shave all did their bit toward

returning me to a somewhat remorseful
degree of normalcy

  i was able then to walk back into
the bedroom and remove the chair from
the bed something prevented my try-
ing to seat myself in it immediately
perhaps it was merely the thought of
the floor jarring i might get and what
it would do to my hangover

  i stood there for a little while star-
ing at the chair and doing a lot of foggy
rationalizing by now i was pretty
damned well convinced that whatever
had happened concerning the chair the
night before was nothing but the result
of my terrific binge my hangover was
all the final conviction i needed on this
score

  god i muttered and i thought
it moved

  i shook my aching head slowly de-
spairingly pondering on the weird ef-
fects of alcohol on the human mind
the impulse to sit in the chair was
quickly stifled by a counter impulse
which told me not to make myself ri-
diculous by dignifying my mad imag-
inings of the night before

  of course it didnt move i mut-
tered absolutely convinced that it
didnt by now and if i plank myself
down in it id only be capping last
nights damn foolishness with the su-
preme proof of my mental incompe-
tence i hope i havent reached the
stage where i have to prove to myself
that the impossible never happened

  and having so neatly tied up all the
loose ends of some very loose reason-
ing i began to get dressed

  once dressed i left the chair in the
bedroom and went downstairs gwen
was happily at work in the kitchen and
had left another glass of milk and gin-
gerale on the dining-room table next
to the morning paper her mother was
evidently in her room for i didnt see
her around
the incredible antique



  i downed the second pick-me-up dis-
regarded the newspaper and went into
the kitchen there were more things
puzzling me around that house than the
chair gwen smiled brightly at me as
i came into the kitchen

reeling better dear

     a little i said then i got im-
mediately to the point look gwen
theres something i want to know
yes dear

  whats up i demanded

  gwen frowned prettily in bewilder-
ment what do you mean dear

  i mean whats up i got drunk last
night i said a number of things at the
time which-incidentally-i still dont
regret you were furious your
mother was sweetly boiling i wake
up this morning after a furious bender
and find you and your mother dripping
with kindly solicitude toward me
whats the idea

  gwen smiled and came over to me
she put her arm around my waist and
her head against my chest

  i told you tom she said were
starting everything with a clean slate
mother and i both agreed that we
should not try to boss you the way we
might have done occasionally in the
past

   i still didnt get it

  but you were all set to walk out on
me i protested

  gwen nodded hasty words spoken
in anger tom im sorry my mother
made me realize what a terrible thing
that would be

  and then all of a sudden it was
quite clear her mother why it
should have been immediately appar-
ent if gwen had walked out that
would have meant that her mother
would be packing too and the old
girl was far too smart to kick over a
nice soft berth in my house just be-

cause her daughter had a mad on
ahhhhh - very clever exceedingly
clever

  all of a sudden it occurred to me
what a sap id been these ten years
here id been letting two women domi-
nate my entire existence my wife and
her mother for all of a decade just be-
cause i hadnt been smart enough to
put my foot down sooner id called
the old girls bluff and she knew it
and from now on in things would be
decidedly different

  mother will leave if you dont go
right upstairs and apologize had been
one of gwens stock phrases on at least
a hundred occasions in our ten years of
marriage and on each occasion i had
gone upstairs to mumble apologies to
the old witch

  mother is packing she wont stay
another instant unless you say youre
sorry that had been another of
gwens favorites antf i had always
rushed up to stop the old girl from
packing and to tell her i was sorry

  but the ironic truth of the matter was
actually that gwens mother couldnt
have been pried loose from my house
with a steam-driven block and tackle

  suddenly i grinned even my hang-
over seemed to fade into a role of minor
importance

  thats fine honey i said thats
swell i think ill go upstairs and
bring down a few of my things from
the attic incidentally i think the new
antique chair would look swell in the
living room corner by the fireplace

  gwen nodded and i could see it
wasnt easy for her to do

  certainly tom but dont try to
fit them all into the living room wte
just havent space for everything

  just a few odds and ends i assured
her gwen looked at me dubiously
but forced a smile of agreement i
walked out of the kitchen on clouds


fantastic adventures

the enemy was routed and fleeing in
all directions it took ten years before
i accidentally stumbled on the formula
for victory but now the battle was
mine and my triumph knew no
bounds everything was wonderful-i
thought   

ty mid-afternoon the house looked
just the way i had always wanted
it to at least ten of my favorite an-
tiques had been added to both the din-
ing-room and living-room scene my
recently acquired roman shields hung
proudly over the buffet and my newly
purchased chair stood in the corner of
the living-room by the fireplace

  gwen had watched my busy rear-
ranging with a tight smile and no com-
ments and even her mother who
popped out of her room now and then
to see what was going on made sweetly
hypocritical comments on how nice
everything was looking

  i was oh-so-busy and oh-so-trium-
phant which was the reason for my
not being aware of what was going on
in the kitchen until about four oclock

  gwen and her mother had been out
there for perhaps an hour fussing
around with the dinner when i hap-
pened to wander out in search of a
hammer i walked in to find the
kitchen groaning with festive dinner
delicacies and almost all our best din-
nerware spread around in preparation
for the table

  well well i observed smugly
some feast for tonight eh

  gwen nodded exchanging a con-
spiratorial glance with her mother

  oh yes tom it will be quite an
occasion mother hasnt seen alice in
all of ten years

  i was munching an olive and almost
swallowed the pit

  mice i bleated whos alice
  gwens mother gave me a sweet

smile an old school-girl chum of
mine thomas we were such great
friends for the longest time and i just
got the letter from her yesterday
letter i wasnt getting any of
this

  gwen nodded mothers friend is
passing through town we invited her
out here

  oh i said for dinner eh

  gwen smiled sweetly you didnt
have anything planned for tonight did
you tom

  her mother broke in with her act of
sweet resignation

  if you dont want her here thomas
ican tell her-

  i cut her off with a triumphant wave
of the hand hell i could afford to be
magnanimous

  not at all i said glad to have
her whens she arriving on what
train

  the five oclock gwens mother
said i told her how to reach us by
the trolley bus her smile was sad
even though it will be hard for her to
have that walk from the bus i didnt
dare think of asking you to pick her
up thomas

  this was an old routine gwen was
looking at me expectantly and i could
have bitten off my tongue for the auto-
matic answer that popped unbidden to
my lips

  wtiy how ridiculous i found my-
self saying of course ill pick her
up

 gwen beamed and her mother
joined then they both said as if in
once voice its after four now dont
you think youd better get ready

  i nodded feeling somehow uneasy
this all seemed far too much like the
old old pattern but then i shrugged
away my suspicions after all i was
still cock of the roost and it didnt
hurt to do an occasional favor   
the incredible antique



rjphis alice friend of my mother-
in-laws proved to be a spinster of
enormous proportions whose full name
was miss alice longwood she was as
short as she was fat which meant plenty
of both it took two porters to cram
her through the passageway and off the
train and it wasnt until all her bag-
gage two trunks and four grips had
been dumped off after her that i saw
the lap dog she had in tow

  it was one of those tiny fluffy evil-
tempered dogs with a snub nose and a
definite superiority complex

  after i had introduced myself this
alice shrilled

  so youre gwens husband

  there was something about the way
she said that which made it sound un-
flattering

  i admitted that i was gwens hus-
band and suggested that she could
check the bulk of her luggage at the
station she gave me a funny look and
said but of course not she had to
have her luggage with her

  we piled the trunks in the back seat
and the grips in the rear compartment
this alice creature sat up in front with
me holding the dog in her lap his
name turned out to be-so help me god
-bity

  bity and i are so glad to have this
pleasant interlude on our trip spinster
alice told me bity and i are just
exhausted i am positively ravenous
and i know bity is too funny the
way i recognized you right off of
course gwens mother told me what you
looked like sos id recognize you when
you met me at the station

  my jaw went a trifle grim at this last
and i asked politely how long did
gwens mother expect this pleasure
oh weeks shrilled alice simply
weeks her graying hair had been
slightly though not successfully
bleached she wore it frizzed up

around the back of her red plump neck

  i remembered the line that had been
given me directions as to how to get
to the house by bus letter just came
yesterday i had been taken in as
neatly as id ever been

  it wasnt necessary to say much on
the way to the house alice did all the
talking she reminisced shrilly about
the fun she and gwens mother had had
as younger belles discussed the horrors
of her train ride related in detail the
victory she won over the railroad porter
when hed tried to put bity in the bag-
gage car

  can you imagine that she de-
manded wanting bity to travel as
if he were an animal or something

  i said i couldnt imagine that and a
few minutes later we pulled up in front
of the house

  gwen and her mother met us or i
should say alice at the door i was
busy breaking my back with her bag-
gage and by the time i got into the
house they were all in the living-room

  wherell i put the bags i asked

  gwens mother smiled sweetly at me
why in the guest room thomas
dear

  i didnt catch on even then i car-
ried the works trunks and bags up-
stairs to the guest room

  when dinner was served i had the
chance to see the worlds greatest appe-
tite at work alices ability to carry on
an endless stream of chatter while stuf-
fing her mouth with everything she
could get her plump red hands on was
strictly phenomenal

  and bity sat at the table

  i mean it the damned little mon-
ster sat atop telephone books on an
extra tall chair lapping his food from
a plate placed conveniently near the
edge of the table for him

once when i went out into the
kitchen to refill the water pitcher gwen


fantastic adventures

followed me her eyes were smiling in
pure girlish delight and she hugged me
warmly

  isnt it wonderful she whispered

  wonderful what

  mother gwen whispered dont
you see how having her old friend here
has made her brighten up a hundred
percent shes been so lonesome
tom

  i gagged a little on this the only
change id noticed in my dear mother-
in-law had been an interest in some-
ones business besides gwens and
mine

  oh tom gwen said not noticing
my lack of reply i am so happy when
mother is happy i she sighed its
been ages since shes seen any of her
old friends

  i started toward the dining-room
and gwen followed

tity had finished his dinner and
with a savage little yelp leaped
from his seat to the floor and trotted
for the living-room

  isnt bity cute alice demanded
hes all through and now hes going
into the living-room for a nap by the
fire and then she went on to repeat
her victory over the porter who wanted
bity to ride in the baggage car like a
bum

  but some sixth sense made me un-
easy i excused myself saying i
wanted to get a smoke and went into
the living-room

  dear little bity wasnt taking a nap
for himself he was doing something
far removed from that he was proving
that he hadnt been housebroken any
too well and proving it against the
leg of my newly purchased antique
chair

  i stood there aghast my jaw slack
unable to move for fully a minute and
during this time little bity went right

on with his mission all the while star-
ing insolently at me as he performed
his sacrilegious gesture

  i let out a shrill bleat of anger but
bity had finished and after a deft
scratch of his hind paws had leaped
atop the chair itself and sat there tri-
umphantly leering at me

  for some reason i turned back to the
dining-room possibly thinking to sum-
mon alice to remove her indecent little
pet from the house that instant

  and then i heard bitys weird howl

  alice heard it too and so did gwen
and her mother they all looked be-
wilderedly at me the expression on
my face didnt clear things up for them

  bity alice shrilled where is
he whats going on whats wrong
with him and then she was up from
the table with incredible speed and
dashing past me into the living-room
i wheeled and followed her almost col-
liding with her wide back-quarters as
she skidded to an abrupt stop

  bity wasnt in the chair any longer

  bity alice shrieked where are
you darling

  there was no answering yelp and
that first solitary weird howl seemed to
linger still in the air

  i looked quickly around the room
there was no sign of the small flea
muft and then something was sud-
denly tugging at the sleeve of my mind
bity had jumped up into the chair
jumped up into the chair on which i
had found it impossible to sit the night
before

  alice was down on all fours present-
ing an extremely large target which
would have made excellent kicking
practice down on all fours yelling
wildly for bity and seeking him under
every conceivable nook and cranny

  but bity wasnt anywhere in the
room any fool could see that any
fool but alice and there was abso-
the incredible antique



lutely no way he could have made an
exit other than right past me i knew
he hadnt done that

  gwen and her mother were in the
living-room now wondering vocally
what was wrong what had happened
hysterically alice told them and for
a little while they joined in her search

  i lighted a cigarette watching the
frenzied search with a sort of pleased
detachment i had the firm conviction
that bity wouldnt be found that he
had never left the chair after hed
leaped onto it but had merely-
through the strange power of the chair
itself-been whipped off into some
never-never land

tont ask me how i knew this i
didnt know it i just felt it id
never had such a certainty about any-
thing else in my life before i decided
to prove it to myself i broke in on the
search

  now now i announced he isnt
in the room he didnt run past me
he might have crawled outside through
the window its partly open yknow

  the living-room window actually was
partly open but i knew bity hadnt
made his departure through there it
had been in my line of vision all along
and id have seen him

  he might get hit by a truck alice
wailed

  i walked over to the fireplace and
ignoring the desecration bity had per-
formed on its leg pulled the chair over
to alice

  sit down and relax a moment i
suggested nothing has happened to
bity hes just outside irrigating the
landscape ill run out and look for
him

  red faced wild eyed alice obeyed
my suggestion as if hypnotized or at
least she tried to

  i had stepped back and was standing

a good three feet away from the chair
when alice made her effort to sit down

  she landed on the floor

  it hadnt occurred to gwen her
mother or the massive alice to watch
the chair but i had done so and
now i was positive as to what had hap-
pened so fast as to be scarcely no-
ticeable the chair had skeetered just
out of range of her bulky posterior

  i was certain now that i hadnt been
so drunk the night before as to have
been unable to sit on that chair i
wouldnt have been able to do so drunk
or sober the chair wouldnt stand to
have anyone sitting on it

  following the deafening thump of
alices near-miss there was of course
her shrill cry of pain and the startled
cries from gwen and her mother

  i stepped in quickly and helped haul
our massive visitor to her feet and then
o the couch she was still whimpering
wildly about bity and insisting that he
be found instantly

  stay right here everybody i said
ill run out and find him right now

  i needed to get outside even though
i knew bity wouldnt be found i had
plenty of thinking to do-plenty there
was no doubt in my mind now that
the chair was exactly what i had found
it to be in my solo drinking bout the
night before my willingness to dis-
miss the facts as preposterously fan-
tastic on waking with a hangover this
morning had been nothing more than a
subconscious fear of the incredible
truth my mental refusal to try again
to sit on it was also a subconscious ex-
pression of fear

  i had heard that the human mind
was a strange thing and now i was
quite willing to believe it for through-
out this entire day i had been delib-
erately closing my mind to the truth of
what had happened the night before i
had been telling myself that id been


fantastic adventures

so wildly drunk that the events con-
cerning the chair had occurred in my
imagination rather than reality i had
forced myself to believe those words
and now i was faced with the problem
of eating them

  but this fantastic truth was not so
difficult to accept subconsciously i
had believed it all day ever since my
first experience with the chair the night
before only in my conscious mind a
mind ridden with the barriers and ta-
boos of the conventional had i doubted
the chairs witchery

t took my time smoking and stroll-
ing along the street and trying to
figure out what it all amounted to

  all right i told myself the
chair moves it wont let anyone sit on
it its alive or possessed or some-
thing

  i turned a corner and lighted an-
other cigarette

  but bity sat on it i told myself
bity sat on it without a bit of trou-
ble and now the fleabags gone

  this was a little tougher knot to
gnaw but i loosened it in surprisingly
short time the answer came in the
middle of my next cigarette

  bity acted in a most ungentlemanly
manner toward the chair i exclaimed
so the chair let bity sit on it in order
to get even i became a little excited
as i followed through my premise
the chair wouldnt let anyone sit on
it more than likely if it didnt have
anything against that person

  there was of course the final dis-
turbing enigma to face where was
bity where did the chair take the
mutt what other world or hidden
dimension was the chair the door to

  i had myself there im not a psychic
guy ive never even been able to figure
out the theory let alone the practice of
occult mumbo-jumbo but i tingled

with excitement nonetheless at finding
out and my mental debate from then
until the time i returned to the house
some ten minutes later was chiefly con-
cerned with how i was going to find
out

  a scene of mad hysteria in which
alice was the center greeted me when
i returned to the house i learned that
she had telephoned the police stations
the hospitals and the morgue in her
frantic search for bity of course
none of them had any trace of the mutt

  alice was weeping with loud enthusi-
asm and explaining just how and why
she would never be the same again
without her bity i listened to all this
for perhaps ten minutes during which
time i couldnt get a word in edgewise
then it occurred to her to ask me had
i seen the mutt

  brace yourself i told her the
last anyone saw of bity he had leaped
into a boxcar at the railroad junction
just before the train pulling the boxcar
started up and on its way to new york
bity is heading eastward without bene-
fit of guide or first class accommoda-
tions

  it was a neat little lie and came to
me in a flash alices reactions to this
bit of news were just what i had ex-
pected them to be

  my hat my coat my grips my
trunks  she shrilled

   i started up the stairs

  but alice the piteous cry came
from gwens mother alice - you
promised to stay six months with usl

  the heat of the moment had forced
my dear mother-in-law into an unwit-
ting betrayal of her little plans she
caught my eye and i looked straight
into hers giving her a cold leer

  so i said

  but alice blubbered on i can never
stay anywhere until i have my bity
back i will search the ends of the
the incredible antique



earth for him if need be 

  i turned my cold leer to gwen i
made it say so you were in on this
too thats why you were so sweet
eh six months visitor eh

  gwen crimsoned and turned her eyes
from mine i went upstairs and got
the trunks and hand luggage of bitys
distraught mistress and brought them
down again as fast as i could then
i called a taxi

  theres a new york train leaving
in half an hour i told alice it will
beat the slow freight bitys riding by at
least four or five hours that will give
you time to locate him when his train
pulls into new york

alice gave me a wildly grateful look
ill never forget you she shrilled

  i bowed from the waist nor i
you i said

hphe taxi came fifteen minutes later
and i bundled alice and baggage
into it gwen watched wordlessly from
the window as alice departed and my
dear mother-in-law wept copiously

  i came back into the house

tom gwen said her ears were
burning her cheeks flushed with em-
barrassment mother didnt even tell
me shed invited alice for six months
no i said coldly

  she only told me alice would be
here a month gwen said pleadingly

  i crossed the living room thats
thirty days i said grimly i picked up
the chair gently and turned to leave
the room holding it in my hands

  tom gwens voice was pleading
for forgiveness she looked bewilder-
edly at the chair what are you going
to do

  i was at the living-room door i
dont know yet i told her

where are you going she asked
and why are you taking the chair
upstairs to the attic i started

up the staircase then paused remem-
bering that i needed some rope i left
the chair on the first landing and trot-
ted down to the hall closet where i
found a thick length of stout manila
then i started back of the stairs gwen
was watching me wide-eyed

  tom she gasped what on earth
are you going to do

  nothing i said that concerns
earth

nce in the attic i locked the door
behind me i stared around at the
friendly array of my antique collection
piled high in every corner there was
a single bulb in the center of the attic
and i snapped that on then i found
my hammer and nails

  i worked quickly and thoroughly
two nails through the foot of each of
the chairs legs driven straight through
into the floor then i got to work on
my length of rope looping it loosely
under the chair and fixing it into a sort
of self operating noose

  undoubtedly it didnt occur to the
chair what my intentions were until i
stepped quickly around to the front of
it slipped down into its seat and pulled
the noose to bind my thighs fast to it
and then hell broke loose

  the chair was trying to rock to tear
itself free of those nails id driven into
its feet to hold it to the floor i was
hanging on for dear life my heart
pounding in wild excitement as the
sound of an eerie whistling began to
grow from a faint whine into an angry
shrill everything was growing black
i felt as if i were in the center of some
vast ebon whirlpool

  and still the chair was trying to free
itself from the floor wrenching and
straining so that it could hurl me from
it before i learned what i would

  sight sound sense of time and space
everything began to pattern into a


fantastic adventures

whirling blot of black confusion the
whistling noise began to dim and the
blackness grew gray and grayer yet un-
til light was almost at hand

  i suddenly felt myself rising in a
great arc through the air i knew i
still sat on the chair and i suddenly
realized that my eyes were closed i
opened them to find myself blinking
hard in the glare of bright sunlight

  that rising sensation was still in my
stomach and i realized that my arms
were tied to the chair and that only my
head was free the shrill catcalling
derisive voices broke into my con-
sciousness then a moment later i
saw the faces grouped around the pond
of water down below me

  they were as mad an assortment of
faces as i have ever seen the faces
of men and women and children who
wore the costumes of early new eng-
land pilgrims hard faces intolerant
and fanatical brightly gleaming eyes
and tightly bared teeth and then the
sense of what they all were shouting
came to me

  sorcerer sorcerer devils advo-
cate

  my sensation of height suddenly
vanished before one of swift nauseat-
ing dropping the air rushed past my
face and the shrill cries of those around
the pond grew louder the water was
rushing up at me and suddenly i hit it
hit it hard splashingly and kept going
down

  even as i started to burble under-
neath the surface of the pond i knew
what this was all about ducking stool
the treatment for sorcerers and witch-
es and people with fresh ideas this
was new england hundreds of years
in the past

  i had no time for quiet contempla-
tion of my weird predicament for i
was far too busy keeping my lungs from
bursting underneath the surface of that

pond seconds passed and i felt sure i
would never be brought up again when
suddenly my ducking chair began to
rise

  again i was free of the water and
rising upward drenched scared half
out of my wits the screams of the
witch-hunting spectators strong in my
ears i had a half glimpse as my feet
shot up an instant of the quaint
buckled shoes i wore

  i remember thinking desperately
what a hell of a way to die 

  then i was reaching the peak of my
upward swing and i knew that in an-
other instant id be plummeting down
into that pond again

  devils advocate

  sorcerer

 tom

  sorcerer the sun became a little
less bright

  devil doctor  but the voices were
still shrill in my ears

  spell caster the whirlpool of
blackness seemed to return

  tom this voice was growing
louder than the others

  devil dealer faintly very faint-
ly almost inaudible

  tom tom darling i was back
in the torrent of blackness and the uni-
verse spun madly around inside my
skull

 tom

t opened my eyes opened my
eyes to see gwen face white in
horror and tears streaming down her
cheeks i was on my back and she was
bending over me the chair lay on its
side a few feet away it had torn
itself free from the floor i was back
in the attic

  tom-are you all right speak to
me darling

  i put a hand tentatively to my shirt
it was dry i raised my head enough
the incredible antique



to stare at the tips of my shoes they
were my own no buckles on them i
looked up at gwen and sighed

  darling darling she murmured
holding my head in her lap why
didnt you say something if wed made
you that miserable why did you
ever try to hang yourself

  huh

  oh darling for almost five minutes
i didnt realize the chair the rope
your hammering and then it made
sense i rushed up here with the cellar
axe and broke the door down your
rope must have snapped at that mo-
ment for i heard the chair crash aid
your body hit the floor i broke the
door down an instant later

  i looked over at the door gwen
hadnt used the axe sparingly it was
in wooden tatters i looked back at
gwen debating about telling her the
truth i decided to let her go on
believing what she did it was prob-
ably the best way   

  you would be astounded at the
peace and serenity that reigned over my

domicile after that gwen was a wife
such as you read of only in books even
my dear sweet mother-in-law knew and
kept her place and for at least eight
months i was convinced that this would
be the new order in the hastings house-
hold henceforward for at least eight
months

  but you cant keep a mother-in-law
down not my mother-in-law at any
rate as i said the first eight months
after that were fine but these last six
have become increasingly troublesome
gwens mother is returning to the med-
dlesome state of mind she was born
with and the situation grows steadily
worse

  for you see i still have the chair
its in the attic under lock and key
and i have a hunch it wouldnt like
gwens mother any more than it liked
bity i have a hunch it would let her
sit down if i arranged it that way the
temptation grows stronger i wonder
how shed take to old salem-and a
witchs ducking chair

the end

you have all heard of loans that are repaid
in  years because they run into millions
of dollars but would you believe that a
judgment for only  will take  years be-
fore it is marked paid in full

  the judgment is against john j oconnell of

year on the judgment

 judge thorne decreed that mr oconnell pay
fifty cents on the th day of february until the
judgment is satisfied accordingly the last pay-
ment will not be due until the year  and this
allows for the fact that the th year in each

lefty feep and the
sleepy-time gal

by robert bloch

it was almost two oclock in the	as a matter of fact i did see spots

morning when i stumbled into	before my eyes very loud purple spots

jacks shack and wearily gave my	on a very loud yellow suit

order to the waiter i had spent a very	lefty feep sat down opposite me

tough day and a gruelling evening of	i opened my mouth to yawn and

work now i was so groggy i could	then let it hang that way in astonish-

almost see spots before my eyes	ment the tall gloomy-looking man-

                           not even dragons could keep
                           feep from plunging on if the
                           sleeping beauty was his goal
about-downtown was dressed in this
shrieking suit topped off with a bright
orange shirt and a blue necktie this
outfit certainly didnt harmonize with 
anything but delirium tremens

  why lefty i greeted him what
are you doing all dressed up and at
this time of night

  i am sitting opposite you in a res-
taurant feep answered and the
reasch i am all dressed up is because
they do not allow you to come in here
naked

  this was a reasonable answer but it
didnt satisfy me

  i mean i continued why arent
you in bed and asleep

  feep gave me a bitter stare

  i do not lay in the hay today be-

lefty feep thrust the coffee bottle into the flame from the dragons nostrili




fantastic adventures

  cause i am just a lunk in the bunk he
  told me

 whats that mean in english
 like i say i am no score with the
 snore my forty winks are on the
 blink

 hows that

  feep sighed

 i am up because i got insomnia
 insomnia too bad i stared at
 his haggard face

 the waiter appeared and feep
 turned the haggard face towards him

  bring me a cup of black coffee he
  moaned

 i stared at feep in amazement if
 you have insomnia why order black
 coffee i asked him

  it will just keep you awake

 feep grinned

 sure i know that i got insomnia
 and i want to keep it

 you want insomnia

 lefty feep nodded

  but why not get some sleep i per-
  sisted

  because if i go to sleep i am liable
  to meet the girl of my dreams he
  told me

 well whats wrong with that

 i already met her

 already met the girl of your
 dreams how could you

 from walking in my sleep feep
 answered he sighed again ever
 since i wish very much to stay wide
 awake because if i dream about her it
 will give me a nightmare

 i scratched my head

 lefty feep youve told me some
 pretty wild yarns in your time-but
 ive never heard you talk in screwier
 riddles than the way you talk tonight
 you say you met the girl of your
 dreams and now youre afraid to sleep
 because you might dream about her
 and it would be a nightmare

 thats my story said lefty feep

and youre stuck with it

  i dont understand at all

  then ill tell you

  stifling a yawn with a piece of toast
lefty feep leaned across the table and
told me the story

  and i was stuck with it

tpver since i am a tiny tot i am a
great guy for the shut-eye  am
a big number in slumber and you never
meet a deeper sleeper when i am a
moppet i sleep in school after i grow
up i go to sleep on the job whenever
i get a chance i head for a bed i hit
the hay some nasty blows in my time

  but up to a little while ago i am not
the type of personality who walks in
my sleep

  once in a while i walk in other peo-
ples sleep for example when my land-
lady sleeps i walk out without paying
the back rent

  then about a month ago i find out
that i am marching in the arms of mor-
pheus i wake up from a sound slum-
ber and find myself standing on the
fire escape outside or waltzing around
in the hallway once i am even out on
the street in my pajamas which is very
embarrassing to me because on this
particular night i do not happen to
wear any

  so i sit down and try to figure out
this matter maybe i walk in my sleep
because i can not stand the lousy mat-
tress on my bed

  i shake the rocks and gravel out of
it and make the landlady get me a new
one or at least one that is filled with
soft stone

  but two nights later i am standing
on the main stem during the early am
and snoring so loud i do not even hear
the bell on the patrol wagon when it
comes up to cart me away for walking
around in public in my shorts

  i tell the judge i am a marathon
lefty feep and the sleepy-time gal



runner but the old beak still fines me
five and costs and not having any
pockets in my shorts i spend the rest
of the night in the old clinkeroo even
there i am always walking in my sleep
and bumping into the bars

  so when i get back to my dump i
am very much down in it

  feep i tell myself this has to
stop you cant take a hike every night
maybe you better go see a morgue-
booker

  now one of the morgue-bookers i
know is a doctor by the name of sig-
mund being a psychologist he is usu-
ally called subconscious sigmund i
meet him a while back and i figure this
sleep-walking problem is right up his
alley

   so i go right up his alley to his office

cubconscious sigmund is sit-
ting behind a pair of goggles when
i come in

  what can i do for you mr feep
he inquires getting out a straitjacket
with a gleam in his eye

  put away the goof-overcoat i
snap i am not whacky i only want
to talk to you

  subconscious sigmund looks plenty
disappointed when he hears this be-
cause he is very fond of finding out
what ticks in lunatics and he collects
nuts like a squirrel

  too bad he sighs i always fig-
ure feep that some day you will be a
fine patient

  i am only impatient now i tell
him but maybe you can help me solve
my problem

  so i slip him the story about my
sleep-walking he listens and nods his
head and pulls at his chin

  then he gets out a little hammer and
hits me on the knee with it and he
measures my skull and he holds lights
up in front of my eyes and he is just

getting ready to give me the hot-foot
or something when i stop him

  cut out all the monkey business
doc i say all i want to know is
whats wrong with me

  he gives me a dirty look

  that he says would take hours
to tell

  meaning what

  feep says subconscious sigmund
im afraid i have bad news for you
i can take it

  im afraid you are a somnambu-
list

  i tear off my coat

  nobody can call me that i yell
and dive for his neck he holds me off

  theres nothing wrong in that
sigmund gasps it merely means you
are a sleep-walker

  i groan

  i know that i tell you that what
i want to find out is how to cure it
subconscious sigmund shakes his
head

  it cannot be cured unless we dis-
cover the cause perhaps i might ask
you a few questions about your
slumber

  you want to hear bedtime stories
no just answer a few simple in-
quiries do you snore

  how else do you suppose a lovable
guy like me gets divorced three times
all my wives get bingo at reno on
the grounds that they cant stand my
snoring

  aha sigmund taps his head
there is a hollow echo maybe that is
the secret perhaps you walk in your
sleep because you cannot stand the
sound of your own snoring

  try again doc i suggest you
can do better than that

  well how do you fall asleep then
maybe there is some subconscious
manifestation there with a psychopath-
ological connotation


fantastic adventures

  the hell there is i tell him i
never am sick a day in my life

  i mean maybe there is a clue to
some mental disturbance in the method
you use to go to sleep

  i just count sheep

cheep repeats subconscious sig-
mund sheep wool-gathering
no domestic fetish no ah-i have
it

  well give it to me then

  sheep have legs havent they

  i do not know i answer i never
notice now if you ask me if blondes
have legs then i am an expert-

  of course sheep have legs sig-
mund interrupts and that is the clue
you count so many legs on these sheep
that you get the impulse to walk you
fall asleep dreaming of movement lo-
comotion that is why you are a som-
nambulist

  i wish you would not use that
word i sigh but suppose that is
true what am i going to do about it
stop counting sheep sigmund
tells me count something else some-
thing without legs

  what would that be

  well-snakes for example

  i should count snakes but how
do you manage to see snakes

  i dont know says sigmund
thats your problem ten dollars
please

  so i walk out of the office with ten
dollars worth of advice i should count
snakes he says and he doesnt know
how i can see snakes either

  but i do

  there is only one way to see snakes
around this town and that is to take a
drink at the y-go inn

  so i go to the y-go

  it is quite a walk and i am very
tired from hiking in my sleep but i
manage to trundle my bunions down the

street to the y-go inn and shove my
torn corns on the brass rail

  the y-go inn is a very unusual
tavern at most places they serve you
a shot but here you get an explosion
the whiskey is not only frisky but
risky the beer is queer and the only
chaser you get is a guy with a black-
jack who runs after you when you
dont pay

  to be frank the y-go inn is not the
kind of a place you want to be found
dead in and you have a very good
chance of that if you dare to take more
than two drinks

  but i am dying for a little honest
slumber and i know that if i have to
see snakes this place has what it takes

  to make a long story censored i
spend about two hours and five bucks
in the y-go inn one drink makes me
shrink two make me turn blue three
is enough for me four and i cant find
the door five and i dont know if im
alive six and im doing tricks

  i sit there and doze away at a table
wishing i had a knife to fight the snakes
off with because they are certainly
coming

  the rattlesnakes arent so bad at
least you can hear them it is the co-
bras and the pythons i dont like also
the vipers in a little while i am in the
anaconda stage just before i fall
asleep completely a crowd of dragons
and dinosaurs come in and begin to
do the conga

  but i remember what subconscious
sigmund tells me and i do not look at
their legs this is pretty hard to do
because i get the idea they are stepping
on me they push me right down into
the dark and i am falling falling-

txhen i wake up again i am walk-
    ing walking

  i know i am awake because if i
wasnt i wouldnt feel it when i get hit
lefty feep and the sleepy-time gal



on the head with a hammer

  and that is the way it feels there is
a lot of clamor with a hammer and so i
know i am coming out of a hangover

  but what am i doing walking

  where am i

  for a minute i am afraid to open my
eyes evidently counting snakes does
not cure me of sleep-walking evi-
dently i get up from my chair in the
y-go inn and roll for a stroll

  evidently

  because when i finally do open my
eyes i am lost absolutely and com-
pletely lost

  it is daylight and i can see very
plainly that i am walking down a coun-
try road like a barefoot boy with shoes
on

  now if there is one thing i know
about this town it is that there are no
country roads in it therefore i am
out of the city either that or out of
my mind maybe both because it cer-
tainly looks screwy around here

  there is nothing on either side of me
but hills the road i am following is
nothing but a little winding trail it
isnt even a state highway for goats
but here i am climbing up in the hills
like a mountain-william

  so i figure i must walk in my sleep
all night at least maybe several days
because the stuff i drink usually puts
you away for that long if not forever

  where i am does not matter so much
to me because there are two other
things on my mind my feet

  they ache very severely i stop and
examine my shoes and see that from
now on i will wear them for spats be-
cause i walk the bottoms right off them

  this disturbs me because now i am
actually a barefoot boy i am lost in
the hill country i am tired and i
need all my strength to keep my tongue
from hanging out so far it drags in the
dust of the road

  but there is nothing to do but keep
going until i come to a sign or a
marker that tells me where i am ma-
rooned so i pedal my extremities along
and mumble unkind remarks under my
breath about subconscious sigmunds
advice and the y-go inns liquor and
my sore feet

 jhe higher i climb up the lower i
feel the more altitude i get the
worse my attitude is to say nothing
of my bunions

  then i see the sign it is just a chalk-
mark on some rocks but i stop and
read it with interest and sore eyes

private

keep out

no trespassing

absolutely no visitors

go away

no dogs children or

human beings allowed

  well i am not a dog and i am not a
kid either and after all my troubles
i hardly feel human

so i turn off at the little path behind
the rocks and head into some woods

  all at once i nearly run head-on into
a big cave it sticks out from the rocks
and the shrubbery up there and i al-
most fall into it but i do not like the
look of it which is black so i stand
there and decide to see if it is empty

hey i yell anybody home

sure enough a voice comes out

  go away howls the voice i hate
you

  but i want to talk to you

no visitors snaps the voice

  im not visiting i just want some
advice

advice eh snarls the voice i
advise you to go jump in the lake

  i would if i could find it but im
lost

  well go and be lost someplace
else


fantastic adventures

  come out and talk to me-i wont
bite

  no but i will the voice yells back
  please i mumble

  well- says the voice i dunno
who are you

  lefty feep

  animal vegetable or mineral
name it and you can have it i yell
back

  oh all right then the voice
grumbles i hear something stirring
around at the back of the cave and in
a minute this personality comes out

j-te is a very unusual-looking speci-
men and if i ever get him on the
end of a hook i would toss him back

  the guy is very tall and he wears a
very short burlap bag he is also ex-
tremely thin and so is the bag i am
so busy counting his ribs that i hardly
notice his face when i get around to
that i still can hardly notice it be-
cause his face is all buried by a beard

  in fact his whole face is nothing but
a bush with a tomato sticking out this
seems to be his nose

  he stands there in the entrance of
the cave and pulls the wool back from
over his eyes then he squints at me
and grunts

  goodbye he says

 goodbye why i havent said
hello yet

  then why bother go away
  but im lost

  you are im kermit the hermit
  pleased to meet you

  why should you be

  well its good to see a human face
again i tell him

  wish i could say the same about
you

  i do not like to take insults from
this slap-happy pappy but i have to
find my way back to snivelization
somehow so i try to make friends

  so youre a hermit eh i remark
i often wonder why various person-
alities become hermits

  i am a hermit because i am al-
lergic says the guy

  allergic what are you allergic to
  human beings

  you mean you dont like people
you talk too much kermit the
hermit tells me why dont you go
away

  because i do not know which way
it is i say very candid i am lost
what of it i dont think anybody
will miss you

  but i want to get back to the city
kermit the hermit gives me a sour
look

  what i do not figure out he says
is how you get up here in the first
place

  when i decide to become a hermit
i spend three years just looking for a
spot like this where nobody ever goes
i go to the back woods and then i look
for a place back of that why this
place is so deserted i never even see a
fuller brush man and then you ar-
rive i cant figure it out

  neither can i i tell him but i
do not wish to figure it out i just want
to get out

lermit the hermit shakes his
beard and several woodticks jump

out

  i fear i cannot give you any direc-
tions he says i have no knowledge
of what paths exist around here i just
sit in my little cave and hate people all
day long

  never mind your hobbies i shriek
getting plenty irritated i cant waste
any more time around this part of the
country

  plenty of time kermit the her-
mit grumbles time is longer than
anything
lefty feep and the sleepy-time gal



  all at once his eyes light up

  now that youre here he says i
think i have an idea why dont you
become a hermit too

  me an uptown boy a hermit
certainly its a wonderful life
maybe you wont like the isolation at
first but youll enjoy the solitude the
loneliness is good too particularly if
there isnt anybody around besides
the emptiness is so deserted

  i begin to see for the first time why
this knave lives in a cave

  it is so the squirrels wont get him
but i certainly dont want to pick
raisins off this fruitcake so i shake
my head

  i dont care to become a hermit
just yet i tell him alimony or no
alimony all i want is out if you
cant give me a road map at least you
can tell me how to find my way
through these hills

  very well then says kermit
scratching the bottom of his burlap
bag maybe i cannot tell you where
to go but i can at least warn you where
not to go

  he stabs his skinny finger off in the
direction of the trees to his left

  keep away from the valley beyond
those trees he says

 why

  dont ask questions i do not like
questions because it is not good to talk
about it

  what are you being mysterious
about what is in that valley
never mind just stay away
look here my fine feather-brained
friend i tell him i am not afraid of
man nor beast and i know plenty of
both why one time i even play around
with the dwarfs that rip van winkle
knows up in the catskills

  kermit the hermit scowls

  beyond those trees is something
worse than sleepy hollow he tells

me it is a place where nothing stirs
that is why this country is so deserted
you are the first wideawake fellow i
see here

  what do you mean

  there is a legend connected with
the valley beyond he whispers they
say the land is enchanted everyone
there is fast asleep

  are they pretty fast awake too
i ask but he only sneers at gags

  do not mock he mutters i once
ventured to the edge of the valley and
i can see that it has the look of a
doomed place a place to shun

  well give out the dope ditto i
request

  so kermit the hermit tells me the
legend of the valley

 a mighty king resides in the val-
ley beyond he tells me he
dwells in a great palace and is rich be-
yond mens wildest dreams servants
and slaves attend him and keep his
treasures but his greatest riches is
his beautiful daughter the princess she
is a girl as beautiful as a dream

  all this is long ago remember for
a time comes when an enchantment
falls upon the land a wicked enemy
of the king condemns the monarch and
his daughter and all his people to an
unending sleep

   now all in the castle all in the vil-
lage and all in the land around lie in
enchanted slumber the legend fore-
tells of the coming of a prince charm-
ing who will win through to the castle
his kiss shall awake the sleeping
beauty who lays asleep in the castle
and cause the enchantment to dis-
solve

  of course when i hear this from
kermit the hermit i immediately know
several things first that he is screwy
second that what he is giving me is an
old kids yarn about the sleeping


fantastic adventures

beauty and third that maybe there
is some truth in it at that

  i try to translate his line of gab into
english again and that way it makes
some sense

  some old moneybags builds himself
a fancy mansion back in the hills a long
time ago this tycoon goon lives there
with a flock of flunkeys his daughter
is a pretty fancy frail then all at
once the whole gang goes down with
some kind of sleeping sickness and
there they lie

  but i decide to humor my cave-man
companion a little

  sounds plausible to me i tell him
but why dont you ever go there your-
self you could be prince charming
and pull this frail out of her mickey
finn-ish with a smack on the puss and
win yourself a honey with money
kermit the hermit smiles

  dont you understand the region
is enchanted i tell you that is why it
is deserted around here-because of
the enchantment anyone who ventures
into the valley falls asleep at once like
all those in it

  i see

  besides scowls kermit changing
his tone of voice i do not like women
anyway because they are so feminine
and beautiful women are much too at-
tractive and pretty

  the princess is a real ginch eh
shes the girl of every mans
dreams he tells me imagine a mai-
den of about eighteen with alabaster
skin hair like spun gold a neck as
graceful as a swans-with ruby lips
and eyes like stars

  wow i remark imagining same
what would anyone want with a
girl like that he grunts

  i do not tell him

t ut i am beginning to think over his
     little bedtime story

  a beautiful ginch like that with
money too-in a slumber beyond the
lumber just waiting for a prince
charming to come along and kiss those
ruby lips of hers

  maybe it is true after all maybe
it is destiny that makes me walk in my
sleep as well as bad liquor

  maybe i am supposed to wake the
sleeping beauty

  you see there is something i do not
tell subconscious sigmund when he
psychoanalyzes me something i do not
tell kermit the hermit either i am
just a wee bit ashamed of it

  after all at my age and with my
experience with various tomatoes i run
around with and marry it will sound
foolish to confess that i walk in my
sleep because i dream of some jeanie
with light brown hair

  but it is the truth

  ever since i start this sleep-walking
i have this dream about a beautiful
ginch she is a blondie and looks just
like the number kermit the hermit de-
scribes in his report on local gossip

  can it be that i dream about this
number in my slumber because she is
the sleeping beauty

  anyhow it is worth finding out

  so i stride off through the woods in
the direction that kermit the hermit
is pointing

  hey he yells where are you
going

  im off to see this beauty cutie i
reply

  but it means your death-youll fall
asleep like all the rest and be put under
enchantment

  listen i tell him i am an up-
town boy and i will not be caught
napping

  i warn youl

  and who are you just a wart in
this neck of the woods

  is that so yells kermit the her-
lefty feep and the sleepy-time gal



mit jumping out of his burlap sack in
excitement and just who do you
think you are

  me i am prince charming of
course

  all at once kermit the hermit gives
a little grunt and trots after me

  i must admit i admire your cour-
age he says so you really are going
to take a chance

  why not it isnt far to the valley
-only a sleeper jump

  but how do you expect to keep
awake

  i dont i tell him only you for-
get there is one thing that makes me
different-one thing which makes me
think i can get through to the castle
even if i fall under the spell of this
supernatural mickey finn and doze
off

  what is that he asks

  well i can walk in my sleep ill
just keep right on going whether im
awake or not

  kermit the hermit grunts again
you know i think you might do it
at that he cackles here-wait a
while and maybe i can help you
how

  ill just step into the cave and brew
something up for you

  so i sit down wondering what the
old goat is going to do and pretty soon
a smell breezes out of the cave
whats cooking i yell

  coffee says kermit the hermit

cure enough in a little while he
runs out with a couple of thermos
jars filled with coffee

 this might help to keep you
awake he says

  i appreciate it i answer if i win
the princess i will come back here and
build you a swell new cave with inside
plumbing

  bah sneers kermit the hermit

i dont want anything now go away
im beginning to like you and if theres
anything i hate its liking people the
trouble with knowing people is that
after a short acquaintance they become
friendly

  i can see he is getting one of his
dizzy spells again so i pick up the
thermos jugs and march off into the
distance

  the last i see of kermit the hermit
he is waving goodbye to me with the
end of his beard

  then i get into the trees and it is
over the river and through the woods
for me as i mention before the coun-
try is plenty wild around here

  now it gets wilder and so do i be-
cause i am always tangling my trousers
in the underbrush or getting my coat
caught on the bushes

  after about half an hour of hiking i
begin to feel tired so i stop and open
one of the thermos jugs to take a gulp
of hot coffee this sets me right and i
wade on some more

  by this time i am practically lost
again nothing around me but trees
for a minute i am tempted to turn
back but there are two reasons i do
not do so

  the first reason is i want to see if
there is anything to this yarn about
the snoozing cutie the second reason
for not turning back is that i no longer
know which way is back

  so i tramp further and further and
it gets darker and darker

  then all of a sudden there is a
change in scenery

   i feel it first before i see it

  the air is suddenly very still the
little breeze that runs through the
woods dies down to nothing the trees
stop rustling their leaves and the grass
doesnt blow

  thats what i feel stillness

  then i see the stillness


fantastic adventures

ajhe branches over my head just

   droop without any swaying the
bushes under my feet hang down the
flowers are all closed up

  at first i think these hunks of vege-
tation are dead then i realize they
are asleep

  more and over i notice that there
are ants on the bark of the trees-and
the ants dont move even when i
reach out and touch them they stay
still fast asleep

  looking up i can see birds hanging
upside down from the trees other
birds are lying in their nests with their
feet in the air dead to the world
sound asleep

  i am beginning to droop myself so
i swig some more coffee finishing up
the first thermos jug and go on

  all at once i hear something a
noise a terrible noise there is an
awful grunting sound from in back of
the bushes i step ahead right on
tiptoes and peek around

  and so help me little red riding
hood i see a big grey wolf

  his mouth is open but his eyes are
shut he is also sound asleep and
what a sound because the noise i
hear is the wolf snoring

  i walk on and now i notice a lot of
little things i overlook before squir-
rels in the trees asleep rabbits and
gophers and chipmunks making a try at
shut-eye minks catching forty winks
woodchucks sawing wood

  and all the while the trees are getting
thicker and thicker so are my eye-
lids there is nothing to do but stop
again open the second thermos jug
and inhale black coffee

  then i resume my ramble through
the brambles

  i go a few feet between some very
thick trees with moss on them and i
see this guy

he is a fat little personality and

his belly hangs on the ground this is
not as bad as it sounds because he is
sitting down to be exact he is propped
up against the base of a tree snoring
away for dear life

  it is not his looks that intrigue me
so much as the clothes he is wearing

i examine them very closely-a high
bowler hat a choke collar and a
checkered suit that looks like it gets
rained on during lincolns gettysburg
address

   to be brief this sleeping citizen is
dressed like the old family album char-
acters of  or some such annum

  naturally this puzzles me plenty i
walk up to him and tap him politely on
the derby nothing happens so i
take off the derby and tap him im-
politely on the noggin still nothing
happens

  then i give him a diplomatic kick
he doesnt stir he snores on i
shake him and jump back a foot be-
cause something sticky falls into my
hand it is a spider-web hanging
from his nose

  another look and i even see the
spider but the spider is asleep

gor the first time i realize that there

  is actually some truth to what the
hermit tells me this specimen looks
as though he is sleeping here for the
last  years

  i just have to take another swig of
coffee on that and i only wish it is
something stronger

  then i march on by this time there
is a thicket twining around all the
trees and i almost need to cut my way
through so i bring out a little knife
i carry around with me in case of trou-
ble or crap games and slice the vines
in front of me in order to keep moving

   in a little while i stumble across an-
other exhibit for the sandman another
and what a man
lefty feep and the sleepy-time gal



  only this one is lying right across
the path he is wearing one of those
coonskin caps and buckskin breeches
like this historical character daniel
goon he carries a squirrel rifle but
it is plenty rusty from lying on the
ground and the citizen is plenty
dusty from the same cause

  i run across him so fast i actually
step on him but he doesnt stir

  one more gulp of coffee and twenty
yards later i spot two items in white
wigs and brass button coats they are
right out of washingtons time-as a
matter of fact they look like a couple
of valley forgers to me

  this time i do not bother to shake
or wake them i know it is useless
and besides i need my strength i am
very bleary and weary

  but i hack along and down under
the vines ahead i kick my foot against
some armor this armor is worn on
the chest of a spanish-looking greaser
with a beard like the youngest smith
brother i do not even like to think
about how long he sleeps here may-
be two or three hundred years

  i realize more than ever that kermit
the hermit is right when he says rip
van winkle is an insomniac compared
to these lazybones

  now with my own eyelids trying
to make an open-and-shut case out of
me i more than ever long to turn
back

  but i think of the sleeping beauty
all of these finks try for the jackpot
and fail will i be caught asleep at
the switch never

  so i hack on

vtow i see a lot of guys lying all
over the woods - drowsy but
frowsy the place resembles an out-
door flophouse but no flophouse ever
has such residents as these

  because they are evidently going

further and further back in history
there is an old duffer in tights and a
cap such as they prance in france in
about  then i spot a couple of
english soldiers with long bows pretty
soon i come to a knight in full armor
with a broadsword he has it up in
the air plowing away at a branch and
evidently he falls asleep standing up
because the sword is still in the air

  when i think of how he must step
right out from the center of the middle
ages cold chills run up and down
my spine

  more coffee

  when i put the thermos cap back on
there is only a little left i wonder how
much further i have to go not too far
i hope or i will probably run into
sleeping ape men and dinosaurs

  i cut my way into the brush another
stretch getting wearier and wearier
one more yawn and i know im gone

  i open my mouth but no yawn comes
out

  instead its a scream

  because just when i think about see-
ing dinosaurs i do see one

  at least i see a long green tail it is
too long and too thick to belong to a
snake it curls out from behind a
giant tree up ahead

  i approach very slowly because how
can you walk fast with your knees
knocking together

  one look at what is behind that tree
and i am back in my hangover

  it is a dragon

  as i exist and inhale curled up be-
hind the tree in those deep-sleep woods

  it is a dragon

  the meanest greenest dragon you
ever want not to see

  the minute i scream i regret it
greatly because i do not desireto
attract the attention of anything like a
dragon at this time

  but nothing happens i notice then


fantastic adventures

that the dragon is fast asleep like
everything else in the forest it does
not snore but tyith every breath a little
jet of smoke and flame spouts out of
its nostrils seeing as how the dragon
has a head the size of a blast furnace
this is not remarkable

  i decide to go away from there with
quick swiftness just in case the dragon
does wake up so i move my legs
nothing happens

  i can not move i am too tired to go
on

  so i open the thermos jug for coffee

tt is all i can do to unscrew the lid i

  am so weary but i get it off one
gulp of nice hot coffee will wake me up
again

  only i do not get a gulp of nice hot
coffee i get a mouthful of cold coffee

  this i do not even swallow because
i am already falling asleep

  you must stay awake lefty i
tell myself once you lay yourself
down to sleep youll never get up

  but i cant help it i am getting
numb all over

  i try to grope in my pockets for a
match maybe if i light a fire and heat
the coffee in time-

  there are no matches in my pocket

  what to do fall down and snooze
in the ooze i try to think but all i
do is blink hot coffee-

  in between blinks i look back and
see the dragon he is still breathing

  saved i yell

  i muster up all my bluster and man-
age to drag myself back to the dragon

  then i pull out the thermos jug and
hold it up i take out the inside part
with the coffee in it and stick it over
the dragons schnozzola

  every time he breathes the fire comes
out and in a minute or two it boils
my coffee again

  i just manage to raise the jug to my

kisser and swallow the coffee

  immediately i get hep to a little pep

  i stride off and make a slash and
dash on through the woods

  from now on the boy scouts will
have nothing on me at least not when
i have a sleeping dragon handy

  i creep along like the last of the moe
hickans or whatever his name is and
my final burst of speed wins the day

  all of an instant i am chopping my
way clear of the woods and coming out
on the other side

  i stand on a little hill looking down
at a valley in the valley is a small
town it looks like a typical hick burg
except for one thing

  in the center of the town is a castle

  not a millionaires mansion but a
genuine authentic castle-like the ones
warner brothers build for errol flynn
it has battlements and turrets and bas-
tions and all that kind of nonsense on
it too

t know at a glance that this is where

  the sleeping beauty is making lazy
like crazy

  down the hillside i go all keyed up
i do not mind my weariness any more

  pretty soon i am walking right
through the village

  the streets are made of cobblestones
and the houses are very ancient they
look like the ones in old picture books
with storks nests on top in fact i
see a stork in one standing on one leg
sound asleep

  some of the doors of the houses are
open and i can look inside sure
enough the whole village is filled with
slumberlanders

  a cook is asleep over his oven three
brats are asleep hunched over a marble
game an old man snoozes under a
tree a milkmaid is snoring at the busi-
ness end of a cow

  down next to the village hall the
lefty feep and the sleepy-time gal

  i

town cop is sleeping in his chair but
then there is nothing so unusual in
that

  what is unusual is the costumes
these personalities wear they are all
ancient vintage stuff like they wear in
europe during the time of the early-
number louies in france

  here in the village the drowsiness
hits me again and i am ready to go
down for the count but i drag along
to the big moat in front of the castle
because now i must not fail

  after all-i walk in my sleep i yearn
for this girl of my dreams-and here is
the chance to make it all worth while
the chance to make it all come true
for me

  i mumble kermit the hermits words
under my breath for encouragement
hair like spun gold a neck as graceful
as a swans perfect and rich too

  so drowsy but lousy i head into the
big stone castle

  from then on it all seems familiar-
just like in the yarn they hand the
nursery brats

  in the castle kitchen the knaves are
asleep over their tarts the scullions
are resting their skulls on the tables
the page boys are lying on the floor
with a pack of wolf hounds

  i ignore them and creep upstairs
there in a long hall sits an old geezer
with a beautiful purple robe trimmed
with vermin there is a crown on his
head and i know that he is the king

  but the fatigue has got old fatty and
he leans back on his throne and snores

  next to him is the queen she will
not make such a bad-looking mother-in-
law at that i figure

  i do not waste any more time

  because i am beginning to get im-
patient to see my future brawl-and-
chain

  besides believe it or not i am actu-
ally beginning to feel more and more



at home here it all seems natural
enough now that i should come high-
tailing into a fairy-tale and double for
prince charming

  who knows maybe it is fate
maybe i am meant to meet my dream
girl face to face

  anyway i am going to have a try at

it

co i bounce up the steps to the second
floor of the castle and start looking
for the bedroom of the princess

  the first bedroom has nothing in it
but wolf-hounds again i let sleeping
dogs lie

  the second bedroom houses a couple
of dignified-looking old babies who i
take to be the court ladies

  but the third bedroom

  i can tell from the handsome carved
door that this is it

  so i stop and slick my hair down
straighten my tie and pick a few of
the burrs out of my bustle

  then i pucker up my lips a few times
for practice and walk in

  sure enough there in the big room
lying on a huge canopy bed is the
princess

   i can tell it is her at a glance even
though she is sleeping with her head
under the covers the sheets are thin
and the pattern of the body underneath
them would win any beauty contest

  i tiptoe over to the bed and look
down for a minute

  just during that second i have a lit-
tle qualm in my mind

  should i wake the princess

   i never believe in fairy tales but this
one seems to be true should i spoil it
all by waking her up and passing my-
self off as prince charming

 then i think of the girl of my dreams
-eyes like stars ruby lips that ala-
baster skin the neck as graceful-oh
nuts i am not much on the poetry


fantastic adventures

but a beautiful blonde with money

  so i bend down very gently pull the
covers back and kiss the sleeping
beauty

che turns around she stirs she
throws the covers off her head she
is awake

  she sits up

  i look at her

  all at once i am not tired any more

  i am peppy enough to give a loud
yell

  i am also peppy enough to run like
hell out of there-down the stairs
through the village and all the way
through the woods

  when i get into the woods i am en-
couraged to run some more because
when i wake the princess everybody
else wakes up too the castle and vil-
lage people are awake and the per-
sonalities asleep in the woods also rise
and shine and so does the dragon-
only he must sneeze when he does so
on account of the woods are suddenly
cm fire

  that is why i hop through them in
such a hurry and just in time too
they burn very swiftly and i know
that the woods the village and the
castle will be going up in smoke behind
me

  i come out somehow on a road way
down past the cave of kerftiit the her-
mit by this time i am quite a sight
with my torn clothes and singed hair
to say nothing of the horrified expres-
sion i must register on my puss

  it is enough to make the truck-driver
compassionate when he comes bounc-
ing down the road at this time he
gives me a lift and asks no questions
and so i arrive back at the city

  you might think i am plenty tired
because of all these experiences and
you might think right but i do not
wish to sleep its like i say-if i

sleep i may see the face of the sleep-
ing beauty and that i cannot stand

          	 

t efty feep sank back in his
 chair

  there is one thing i cannot stand
i remarked

  what is it

  your story i told him

  what is wrong with it feep in-
quired through a yawn

  what is right with it i countered
first of all you try to make me be-
lieve that an old fairy tale is actually
true thats bad enough then you
make it worse

  worse

  of course you say you actually
were the party who woke up the sleep-
ing beauty and you ran away
naturally

  naturally eh how do you ex-
plain that

 well-

i raised my hand and silenced feep
i think i know what youll tell me
youll tell me she wasnt the sleeping
beauty at all but some ugly old
woman

  not at all she is the sleeping
beauty and the story is true thats
the whole trouble feep answered
the story is too true

  too true

  yes she is too much like the de-
scriptions of such a fairy-tale princess
that is why i cannot stand to look at
her because when a fairy tale comes
true it is pretty awful

  feep sighed i run away and so
would you

  why i snapped just what did
she look like

  feep grinned

  you remember the description of
the dame that kermit the hermit hands
me a maiden of about eighteen with
alabaster skin hair like spun gold a
lefty feep and the sleepy-time gal



neck as graceful as a swans-with stone skin hair like gold wire a swans

ruby lips and eyes like stars

   yes

   well that is what she looks like
and i ask you said lefty feep
would you marry a girl with white

neck and a lot of jewelry where her
lips and eyes should be

   give me a taxi-dancer any time
give me some of that black coffee
i sighed i think i need it too

protecting production methods

a constant problem to companies who
have perfected a new process is how to
- prevent other companies from learning the
secret of the process and reproducing it even
trusted workmen can often be bribed to give
away vital production information

   a very excellent protective method now in use
 in many companies is the false face plan weigh-
 ing devices and thermometers are graduated with
 scales that have no meaning without a code this
 code is only known to top management thus

 one unit on the scale can mean one pound three
 pounds or any other unit that is convenient
 the only prerequisite is that all devices have the
 same scale the workmen are instructed to heat
 the solution to a given point on the thermometer
 or to mix the material weighing three units with-
 out knowing the exact temperature of the solution
 or the correct weight of the material a com-
 petitor could not reproduce the conditions under
 which the product was prepared unless he had
 access to the code

helping the anti-noise campaign

 have thoughts of murder ever entered into
 your mind when your heavenly sunday
 afternoon snooze was interrupted by
 some young squirt who impatiently sat on his
 automobile horn as he waited for the girl next
 door

   if such has been the case you had better sit
 down right now and write a fan letter of undy-
 ing thanks to mr joe white of anderson indiana
 who has invented and patented a device to pre-
 vent a horn from being operated while the car

 is parked this innovation is an electrical control
 system that only allows the driver to use his horn
 as a warning signal while the car is in motion

   even if the car is standing still and the motor
 is running the device prevents the horn from
 blowing

   this should prove to be a very effective
 squelcher for that pain-in-the-neck who starts
 to blow his horn madly when the traffic signal
 turns yellow because he has no time to wait for
 the green light

the gorilla family

the typical gorilla family is made up of
one old male about three females and the
children authority in the family rests in
the one male who is able to beat up all the other
members of the family he is given his due
respect

   when the young males reach the breeding age
 they break away from the family and mate with
 females who have also broken their family ties
 these unions result in new families which follow

 the exact pattern of all gorilla families

   the head of the family continues to rule only
 as long as he is the strongest as he gets older
 his sons will challenge his authority and he can
 only maintain his leadership by beating them in
 battle just as soon as he loses one battle the
 victorious son drives him out of the family the
 remaining days of his life are spent in lonely
 wanderings about the jungle

old age of a parachute

a worker has to wait until he is  years
old before he can retire on his government
- social security pension but an army par-
achute only works for seven years before it
reaches the retirement age

   the date each chute goes into use is recorded
 and exactly seven years later the chute is retired
 from any further use by army personnel how-
 ever the chutes find other uses in the array

if the chutes are found to still be in good con-

 dition they become cargo chutes which are used
 to drop supplies weapons tools and other es-
 sentials for the armys parachute army and to
 posts not easily accessible by land routes

   if the chutes cant pass the cargo requirements
 they are cut up into white scarfs for the flyers
 when the supply of scarfs begins to pile up the
 women of the army post step in and use the
 chutes to make underthings from the silk and
 nylon

guage whose tones are so high and thin
as to be completely inaudible to the
human ear it exploded in a sour snort
from the throat of benny the echo on
duty at his post in the highest gallery

  so there were only two who heard
him

  the first was nysa the echo who
occupied the shadowy niche to the
right of bennys she was a gorgeous
creature slim and sylph-like and beau-
tiful as the nymphs from whom she
took her name almost always her
brown eyes were warm and soft when
she looked at benny but just now
she was shocked

  benny she exclaimed

tts to be expected my dear broke
in the second listener snippishly

she too was a woman but what a
difference for where nysa was the
soul of charm this echo had all the
undesirable characteristics of a profes-
sional spinster she radiated prim
propriety and even her sharp bony
features seemed to point to a pica-
yunish nature her niche was on
bennys left

  to be expected griffina nysas
big brown eyes showed puzzlement

  of course sniffed griffina what
can you hope for from benny theres
a rebellious streak in him he has no
respect for authority or tradition
she bobbed her head in a persnickity
nod thats it no respect for au-
thority or tradition hes bound and
determined to cause trouble just
mark my words

  scowling benny turned to face her
he was a husky young echo with a
good-natured face but he had a stub-
born jaw too-and right now it was
jutting like a battle cruisers ram

  why shouldnt i say nuts he
demanded disgustedly did you ever
see such a sight to listen to her talk
youd think that fat lump of wiener-
schnitzel down there was schumann-
heink galli-curci and alda all rolled
into one or even better maybe-
they all sang in this house without do-
ing any kicking

  temperament must be expected
from great stars griffina retorted
primly

  temperament benny snorted
its temper for my money the way
she called down that nice girl whos
doing micaela another snort sig-

  	nysa in grecian mythology was earths most
beautiful valley in it dwelt the famed nysaean
nymphs legend has it that zeus eventually trans-
formed these lovely creatures into the hyades
stars supposed to bring rain when they hang near
the horizon as their reward for caring for his son
dionysus-ed
the outlaw echo



norina indeed her title should be
dummkopf 

  benny nysa remonstrated again
no respect griffina broke out
again therell be trouble nysa
mark my words benny is-

  but new tumult from the stage cut
her short

  if were going to rehearse- mar-
garet johnson was saying

  when did you become director
the plump miss wenkelstein slashed
fiercely who are you to order me
around you little upstart

  really signorina i didnt mean it
that way-

  you think you can impose on me
because allan carruthers likes the
shape of your legs the diva raged
dont think i havent seen it-
oh gasped margaret flushing to
the roots of her golden hair signorina
wenkelstein you cant say such a
thing you cant mean it-

  oh i cant cant i the divas
dark face was aflame with anger
well let me tell you i wont stand
for it the way you two carry on is
a disgrace-

  ladies ladies shouted allan
he might as well have yelled at the
wind neither of the two singers paid
him the slightest heed

  but now margaret sprang forward
her lithe young body tense with fury
the humility gone out of her

  star or not you cant say those
things about me she cried

  smack

  her open palm lashed out con-
nected squarely with the prima donnas
plump cheek

youl shrieked the diva her
stubby fingers clawed for a hand-

  	signorina is italian for miss as used by
helena wenkelstein it is clearly an affectation
dummkopf freely translated frorti the german
is equivalent to the american dopey-ed

ful of margarets hair

  the next instant the two of them
were rolling on the floor in a wild flurry
of feet and fists

  atta girl margaret give er
hell   whooped benny high in the gal-
lery jumping to the back of a seat in
the last row in his excitement show
that spaghetti soloist where to head
in-

  benny

  even as nysa spoke other members
of the opera troupe sprang to separate
the two embattled singers

  wasnt it swell enthused the
echo hopping back to his niche his
face was aglow boy that american
girl sure called signorina sausages
bluff

  but from the stage rose helena
wenkelsteins angry half-hysterical
voice

  she attacked me she raved
that hussy attacked me

  please signorina begged allan
you mustnt-

  the prima donnas pouter pigeon
bosom heaved

  and let me tell you something mis-
ter director allan carruthers she
cried you can get rid of that pet of
yours right now i wont sing on the
same stage with her 

  please signorina wenkelstein-
you heard me the womans
dark eyes flashed fire her fire her
right now or i quit 

  allans face hardened his lips
thinned

  im still director of this company
signorina he reminded miss wenkel-
stein a bit coldly also you have a
contract-

  a contract the stars sneer was
a masterpiece of contempt and rancor
are you silly enough to think you can
hold me to it whose name is putting
this show over mine or that johnson


fantastic adventures

creatures and as far as your being
director is concerned how long do you
think it will take the new york office
to remove you when they find your
attitude has forced me to leave
nevertheless youll obey orders or
be charged with contract violation
snapped allan but his face was
white

  thats telling her approved
benny from the gallery keep it up
buddy

  then i leave flared signorina
wenkelstein good-bye

  with a swish and flourish she
stalked toward the wings

  no

  it was margaret johnson her face
was pale

  you cant do it she cried ill
quit right now

  margaret choked allan

he girl turned to him

  the signorinas right allan
she told him earnestly its her name
thats making this tour a success if
she leaves youll lose your job as di-
rector and the new york office will
hire her back on her own terms id
rather quit now than to see it turn out
that way

  you cant margaret-

  my minds made up the girl
answered determinedly im leaving
and to the prima donna who had
halted at the interruption

  will that satisfy you signorina
will you sing

  a grin that was positively ghoulish
in its triumph rippled over the divas
round face

  i shall stay she proclaimed but
you must go at once

  slowly biting her lip to hold back
the tears margaret left the stage

  up in the gallery benny the echo
lathered with rage

  are we going to let that fat phoney
get away with this he yelped are
we going to see that nice margaret
johnson driven out of the company
humph griffina sniffed primly
a lot we can do about it

  it is too bad though commented
nysa regretfully shes such a fine
girl giving up her role and everything
just so that young director wont get
in trouble

  well then lets do something about
it hammered benny lets help
margaret-	

  but how benny nysas lovely
face was worried what could we do
humans cant even see us

  well    benny paced the
floor furiously his good-natured face
lined with concentration

  echoes arent supposed to intervene
in human affairs spoke up griffina
austerely were only allowed to re-
peat what humans say that was
heras ruling

  thats it whooped the irrepres-
sible benny well just echo that
loud-mouthed swiss cheese oh will
we echo her well echo her right out
of this opera house  

  you mean- started nysa wide-
eyed

  there are hundreds of echoes living
here benny rushed on well get
them all together then when that
woman tries to sing carmen well all
echo well make her sound like a bass
with a head cold singing in a cave
he drew a deep breath of satisfaction

  	the original echo was the loveliest of the
forest nymphs one day hera zeus wife and
sister came hunting for one of the nymphs with
whom she believed her husband to be in love but
echos bright conversation occupied the goddess
until the other nymphs could steal away to
punish echo hera condemned her never again
to speak save to repeat others words and so
to this day the lovely nymph is reputed by the
greek myths to live repeating always what others
say-ed
the outlaw echo



oh well teach her to be ugly well
show her what happens when she kicks
about us echoes-

  its against the rules snapped
griffina ive studied every standard
text on mythology ever written and
not once does it even imply that were
allowed to do such a thing its against
the whole greek tradition-

  benny turned on her

  so what he demanded caustically
our branch of the echo family hasnt
lived in greece for a thousand years
records prove that some of us came
ashore with columbus and ive heard
rumors that a few landed with leif
ericson so i think its time we forgot
all that silly greek twaddle and took
out our citizenship papers

ilte glared at the horrified spin-
     ster

  and besides he went on there
are lots of things that dont get into
your blamed mythologies in the first
place us for instance if you de-
pended on books for information youd
never even know that echo married
and raised a darned big family before
she died

  oh gasped griffina such blas-
phemy dont listen to him nysa
ive never even heard such talk before
hes an anarchist an outlaw hell
end up in trouble mark my words-
for a moment nysa hesitated
then

  oh griffina im sure it isnt really
so bad she countered and i do want
to help that nice soprano margaret
ignoring the others horrified lamen-
tations she darted off benny at her
heels expressed his own opinion of
griffina in typical succinct fashion
nuts

  all right called allan carruthers
irritably lets get going weve
only got time for one rehearsal and

were certainly going to need it with an
understudy playing micaela
dragoons and cigarette girls hurried
to take their places on the stage in re-
sponse to his call in less than a minute
all was ready for the familiar first act
of carmen

  elsewhere in the house too there
was frenzied activity

  hurry up shrilled benny take
your places all of you madame mud-
hen down there says she doesnt like
echoes so lets be ready to give her a
good warm reception when she opens
up with the habanera

  in every corner of the vast empty
house his fellow-echoes leaped to do
his bidding they were in the gallery
and the balconies the boxes and the
pit they swung from the chandelier
and they clambered about the frescoes
they scampered over the proscenium
and slid down the draperies one and
all they prepared to distort carmen in
a manner the like of which no theatre
had ever heard before

  on the stage allan turned to the
orchestra

  all right he called lets take
it from the beginning of the haba-
nera 

  music rose from the pit swelled
and filled the auditorium signorina
wenkelstein moved forward spreading
her fan

  ahl love thou art a wilful wild
bird-

  her rich voice grew in power

  at his post high in the gallery benny
the echo brought down his hand in a
sidewise slash that would have done
credit to any baton-twirling drum
major

  all right boys he shouted let
her have it

tt was perfectly timed as one man
the echoes hurled their shrillest


fantastic adventures

voices at the plump diva on the stage
overtones mounted one atop the other
like the squeals of a horde of fat pigs
stuck under a fence

  the effect was startling instead of
sounding like honest legitimate reflec-
tions of sound waves the echoes gave
a hideous caricature of a second and
shriller voice singing in direct and an-
tagonistic competition to signorina
wenkelstein

  a shocked expression leapecl to the
prima donnas moonlike face she
jumped as if someone had suddenly
unleashed an air raid siren directly
into her ears

  but miss wenkelstein was never one
to give up without a fight heedless
of the incredulous gasps from the rest
of the company she let go with the
second line-and this time under a full
head of steam

  and none may hope thy wings to
tame-

  turn on the heat gang benny
roared show that plump penguin
what us echoes can do 

  from every crevice and cranny and
nook and niche came the screaming
answer it smashed at the stage like
the blast of heat from a stokehold fur-
nace

  if it please thee to be a rebel-
shrieked the apoplectic diva

  louder  bellowed benny louder
and funnier

  the echoes let loose in earnest

  allan carruthers looked like a man
who has just seen his wife and three
small children run through a meat
grinder before his very eyes

  stop  he roared for gods sake
shut upl

  slowly like a timid thing silence
crept back into the house

  its this abandoned warehouse that
they call an auditorium raged the
prima donna no one could sing-

  the director ran nervous fingers
through his hair

  all right all right he grated
well try something else he turned
to the mousy little girl who acted as
understudy to margaret johnson
here you lets have your aria

  in the gallery benny commanded
lay off fellows let her sound
good

  the singer playing micaela began
ill not confess that i tremble-
sweet and clear like the note of a
silver bell the girls voice rose on it
went and on to that last high b flat
that climaxes the aria died away in
the softest of mellow echoes

  allan carruthers nodded

  nice going he complimented
youll do he turned back to the
still-flushed signorina wenkelstein
you now try the sequidilla
benny the echo said

  o k boys this is it knock
her off the stage

rim-faced and defiant the star
    stepped forward

  exactly three notes later she stepped

back

  its a plot she screamed as the
echoes died away its sabotage
someones hiding back there with a
foghorn

  its a voice allan retorted icily
a voice that apparently isnt designed
for this field

  the diva glared at him when she
spoke her voice trembled with anger

  are you trying to tell me that i
dont know how to sing i helena
wenkelstein who have performed at
la scala-

  -the metropolitan and the opera
comique the young director finished
disgustedly yes weve all heard that
before the important thing however
is that you cant seem to sing here and
the outlaw echo



the audience is going to be attending
this house not la scala or the met
do you think id be found dead in
this hole screamed back signorina
wenkelstein do you think id sing
for you now for love or money you
puling pipsqueak im leaving do
you hear contract or no contract im
leaving

  with a wild flurry of rage and skirts
she stormed from the stage

   allan let go a sigh of relief

  well thats that he grimaced
now we can get to work

  using what for a mezzo-soprano
mr carruthers queried one of the
dragoons

  the director stopped short

  wtiat do you mean

  miss larrimore the understudy
left with la wenkelstein the man re-
ported the kid studies with her you
know

  feet spread wide apart allan stared
out over the darkened parquet he
stood there in grim silence while ten
long seconds ticked by then at last
he swung back

  i guess that ends it friends he an-
nounced in a voice suddenly gone thick
were minus a carmen and theres no
one in the outfit good enough even to
make a stab at singing her role

  in the gallery griffina sniffed
smugly

  there you are she crowed i
told you all this defiance of authority
and tradition would cause trouble
nysa do you see whats happened
all those people are going to be out of
jobs just because benny was too smart
to listen to me 

  oh benny wailed nysa
theyre not either going to be out of
jobs  fumed the frantic benny bounc-
ing all over his niche in a dither of
worry ill think of something
nysa-

  his light-oloves face was wreathed
in a halo of melancholy

  i do hope so benny she answered
anxiously because-

  because if they are im going to
hold you to your promise nysa  cut in
griffina

  her promise benny whirled
what promise nysa

qh benny-

      her promise to me to keep
away from you in the future if this
crazy scheme doesnt work out grif-
fina exclaimed triumphantly

  nysa it isnt so

  but the lovely sprite hung her head
im afraid it is benny you see i
was so confident  i had so much
faith in you   

  but i knew what would happen
gloated griffina i knew no good could
come of this straying from tradition
and if you think im going to see a
beautiful girl like nysa throw herself
away on an outlaw like you- the
old maid sniffed contemptuously
benny indeed who ever heard of
a respectable echo with a name like
that what your harum-scarum par-
ents could have been thinking-

  benny turned on her fiercely

  who asked you to stick your long
nose into our affairs he demanded
and as far as names are concerned-
well i suppose the best anyone who
gets her monicker from a bird-beaked
dog can hope to do is to go around mut-
tering about tradition like a poll par-
rot- 

  oh

  benny chided nysa in a shocked
voice thats not kind-

  well then why does she go calling

  	the griffins had the bodies of dogs or lions
the heads and wings of eagles or other birds they
were called the hounds of zeus-ed


fantastic adventures

my folks harum-scarum and whats
wrong with my name i understand it
was mighty popular back in brooklyn
where our family came from-

  but by now griffina had recovered
her poise

  ill still have the last laugh she
gloated remember nysa you prom-
ised me youd have no more to do with
a certain riffraffish person if his scheme
didnt work out-

  and just at that moment from the
stage came allans voice

  if we only had someone who could
sing carmen he groaned even if
she were bad we might be able to sal-
vage something-

  i can try

  the voice was sweet and clear and
carrying it came from the black fast-
nesses at the rear of the house

  the young director spun about
  who-

  me margaret the girl came
forward down the aisle she was smil-
ing

  margaret sudden hope sprang
into the directors eyes then died
again as he helped the girl onto the
stage

  no he said slowly shaking his
head youre a lyric soprano not a
mezzo- 

  lyrics have done it before the
lovely miss johnson retorted in a bus-
inesslike tone besides i know car-
mens role as well as i do micaelas al-
most the acting and everything
allan stared at her through narrowed
eyes

  its worth a try he decided finally
lets go through the habanera

  	roughly speaking a mezzo-soprano voice has
a full deep quality which places it between the
lyric soprano and the contralto the lyric soprano
is lighter thinner thus micaela whose role is
sung by a lyric soprano is an innocent country
girl carmen the mezzo a woman of the world-
ed

and then in a low voice that only she
could hear oh margaret im so
damned glad you didnt leave town
and not just because of this jam either
i dont imow what id have done-

  the gfirl flashed him the briefest of
smiles

  but i didnt go she whispered i
had to see you first so i sneaked back

j

tn the gallery benny the echo ra-
diated exultation as a seltzer bottle
does bubbles

  see its all working out i told
you it would  he chortled

  oh benny youre wonderful
breathed nysa

  but griffina remained prim and un-
moved

  dont be too sure yet she sniffed
maybe that girl can sing carmens
part and maybe she cant another
sniff ive been around this opera
house for a long time but ive yet to
see the lyric soprano who could do it

  sour grapes grunted benny

  now the orchestra struck up the
opening strains of the habanera
slowly with all the seductive grace for
which the role called margaret moved
forward

  ah love thou art a wilful wild
bird-

  too thin gloated griffina aloud
she cant do it

  give her a chance you old goat
snapped benny savagely shes get-
ting along all right

  but the husky young echos face was
clouded with worry and beads of per-
spiration dotted his forehead

  and none may hope thy wings to
tame- sang margaret

  stop stop shouted allan re-
lax miss johnson youre among
friends let your voice have some
body some richness-
the outlaw echo



  griffina nodded approvingly

  that young man knows his busi-
ness she announced and then
smugly do you see nysa that
johnson girl cant work into carmens
part so the whole company will be
stranded and your promise-
keep quiet  raged benny it isnt
over yet

  nysas lovely face was strain-
straught

  all right ordered allan again
now from the beginning

  ah love thou art a wilful wild
bird-

  no no thats not it the
young director stamped across the stage
in a frenzy of exasperation miss
johnson your voice is just too thin it
hasnt the fullness the richness for
carmens part im sorry-

  the girls lower lip began to quiver
you see cried griffina gleefully
shes failed-

  benny fidgeted all over the gallery
like a mexican jumping bean dusted
with itching powder

  oh benny wailed nysa begin-
ning to cry

  allan youve got to give me another
chance cried margaret johnson
just one more time ill make it i
swear i will

  its a waste of time grated the
director you just havent the voice
for the role margaret

  please allan-

  the other gave vent to an exasper-
ated sigh

  oh all right then to the or-
chestra music

tts all over now declared griffina
primly come nysa and i hope
you appreciate the fact that none of
this would ever have happened if it
hadnt been for bennys insistence on
flouting tradition-

  the sobbing girl echo managed a nod
  stop shouted benny

 what-

  already music was rising from the
orchestra pit

  gang give her undertones
shrieked benny build out her voice
make her a mezzo sweat was stream-
ing down his face

  ah love thou art-

  a few straggling echoes joined in at
bennys command the girls voice
took on a richer timbre

  more screamed benny help
her boys warm up her voice give
it some color 

  -a wilful wild bird-

  there was a new glow to margarets
tone it swelled took on depth while
the other members of the troop stood
spellbound

  turn on the heat whooped benny
jumping from one end of the gallery
to the other in a frenzy of excitement
come on you baritones open up
you contraltos

  and from every corner of the house
the echoes joined in they brought
margaret johnsons voice to life gave
it the richness the color the dramatic
quality that it needed built it to a
throbbing vibrant thing that brought
gasps from the throats of her fellow-
singers

  then at last the song was finished
the gorgeous glowing voice died away

  for a long tense moment there was
silence then

  you did it shouted allan mar-
garet sweetheart you did it

  oh benny sobbed nysa but
now they were sobs of relief youre
wonderful

  benny swaggered back to her side
i told you id fix things up he
declared

  hmmph sniffed griffina you
havent fixed anything up youve just


fantastic adventures

postponed the trouble

  nysa turned startled

  what do you mean griffina

  use your head snapped the elder
woman caustically the johnson girl
will get along all right while shes here
yes but when the company leaves for
its next engagement theyll be right
back in trouble again because that
singer is still a lyric soprano and noth-
ing anyone can do will change her

vxorry sprang back to nysas
lovely face mutely her eyes big
brown question marks she turned to
benny

  benny frowned jittered nervously
from one foot to the other

  and then like the breaking of an
ocean dawn relief flooded his face

  well go with them he cried
after all were opera house echoes
theres no reason why we shouldnt do
a little touring too

  its against all tradition- began
griffina

  but nysa wasnt listening

  oh how thrilling she exclaimed
her eyes aglow its a marvelous idea

wooden

               

a patent recently issued covers a process
whereby the bark fiber of the redwood
tree is converted into a wool substitute
at present over five tons of this fiber a is
shipped daily to eastern textile mills by the pacific
lumber company of san francisco

   officials of the lumber company claim the red-
wood fiber can be used to replace  of the wool
now used to make blankets clothes etc

   several years ago it was discovered that the
short fibers in the bark that collected in mats and
spun balls on the screen-belts that separate the
long fibers possessed felting characteristics the
short fibers were of little value while the long
fibers became insulating material

   the research staff of the company developed
machinery to recover and segregate the new fiber
and also conducted experiments on its felting
property with the idea of finding a market for
the by-product in collaboration with a large
woolen company the staff made many tests which

benny-

  down in the wings young allan car-
ruthers drew margaret johnson to him

  oh darling im so happy  he
whispered i love you so-

  high in the gallery bennys super-
sharp ears pricked up at the words a
light of mischievous devilment sprang
into his eyes he drew a deep breath
echoed the last phrase in his very deep-
est voice-

     i love you so-

  it boomed out through the empty
house like the roar of breakers on a
rocky coast a little ripple of laughter
rose from the departing singers and
margaret and allan suddenly flushed
and smiled just a little sheepishly

  and as the echo faded like a whisper
the words came again to bennys ears
   i love you so-

  he turned

  it was nysa her eyes dancing with
merriment yet tender her warm lips
were smiling half-parted

  chuckling benny slipped his arms
around her

  and i love you he said

proved that the redwood bark fibers would in-
terfelt and intermat with wool fibers to form a
strong fabric wool shortage caused by the war
speeded up tests until they were perfected

   the textile mills are now able to produce a fabric
by combining the short fibers with natural wool
fibers the blend is carded combed and spun
into yarn which can be woven or knitted into
fabrics which closely resemble pure wool fabrics
the wood fiber in the material ranges from fifteen
to sixty per cent of the combination and will
produce a lighter weight cloth than pure wool
the combination fabric not only saves wool but
also is cheaper

   it was not so long ago that the bark of the
redwood tree was all waste when the tree was
only used to produce lumber today thanks to
scientific research the long fibers of the bark are
used to make palco wool an insulator for cold
storage and meat packing and the short fibers
are processed into a wool substitute

fat women more jolly

tt is a common belief that fat women are better

  natured than thin ones and now dr winfred
overholser of st elizabeths hospital at wash-
ington gives a scientific explanation for this belief

  according to dr overholser the plump person
possesses a feeling of security and well-being
which makes them feel free to laugh and be gay
lean people as a rule have less vigor and less sense
of security which forces them to feel that they
must take life more seriously moreover stout
women feel that they are not so attractive as slim
women and try to offset this handicap with good
humor and a reputation of being good company

	 

florida tree oysters
tvfany strange things live in the florida

	  swamps and one of the strangest are the
oysters that live in trees the oysters usually live
in groups and each group attaches itself to the
root of a mangrove tree half of their life is
spent submerged in water and the other half is
spent on land depending upon whether it is
high or low tide

  the tree oysters differ in structure from ordi-
nary oysters which would not be able to live if
they were regularly out of water for six hours
at a time which is the tide interval the oyster
group looks almost like a plant and is often mis-
taken for some sort of fungus growth by those
not familiar with it

	 

 the garbage pail is doomed

  a new device has been put on the market
which should soon prove to be a welcome
addition to every womans kitchen it is manu-
factured by the in-sink-erator manufacturing
company of racine wisconsin who claim that
it can do away with the need for a garbage pail
in the kitchen

the device is attached to the drain of the sink

and is so simple that any plumber can handle the
installation the main works of the device con-
sist of an automatic reversing motor and rotor
shredder which grinds shreds and pulverizes any
food wastes put into it instead of having to
throw bones scraps peelings cigarette butts and
the like in a garbage pail all the housewife does is
throw them into the sink and turn on the water
the device grinds up the refuse which is flushed
away by the water into the sewer system without
clogging it

  moreover the invention is self-sharpening and
self-cleaning which definitely puts an end to the
garbage problem the only things the device can-
not handle are metal and crockery

	 

      movies mirror life
tv yfovie producers continually strive to make
their pictures portray life as it really exists
the major studios have therefore issued a general
rule that in every crowd scene depicting the pres-
ent day in the larger cities one extra in every
fifteen should be dressed in a military uniform

a larger crop through science

cxperiments with the effects of plant hor-
 mones have brought about larger yields per
acre of several field crops satisfactory results
were obtained by treating the seeds before sowing
and by spraying the plants with plant hormones
while they grew according to professor j c
ireland of oklahoma a and m college who
supervised large-scale tests the plant hormone he
found to be most beneficial was levulinic acid
which is made at low cost from waste material

  cotton seeds and cowpeas responded the best
when treated with levulinic acid showing a fifty
per cent increase in yields over untreated seeds
in addition it was discovered that dusting the
plants with soyflour mixed with one per cent
levulinic acid during the flowering periods aided
in the setting of bolls

  first results show that the process is highly
profitable for the farmers the costs of materials
needed to effectively treat an acre of crops with
levulinic acid runs around  but the treated
acre will yield about  pounds of cotton valued
at  while an untreated acre yields only 
pounds valued at  if results continue to be
good the cotton farmer will reap huge benefits

foreword

   j lthough this narrative con-
  cerns the jail oj the port of diego
  suarez to the surprise attack of the
  british in the early part of iq the
  action of that memorable battle is but
  a background for the weird though
  authentic story that was enacted on
  the island of madagascar during the
  attack on that vital french naval base

     this story was gleaned in part from
  two british marines who were in the
  action which gained a certain obscure
  beachhead on the coast below diego
  suarez from the papers that were
  found on the bodies of three japanese
  naval officers after the battle was over
  and from the tragic official history of
  a once brilliant soldier in the army of
  france who learned many years too
  late what patriotism meant

     parts of this narrative are supposi-
  tion the bulk of it is fact and the
  suppositions fit so flawlessly into the
  few breaches in the facts that it seems
  hardly fair to consider them purely
  imaginary certainly there is no sup-
  position in what was told to us by the
  british marines the records of the
  french military courts will also show
  beyond any doubt the veracity of our
  description of the case of colonel
  jacques chambreaux there are vol-
  umes obtainable in any library on the
  rites and witchcraft still prevalent in




fantastic adventures

certain tribes of the malagasy natives
who inhabit many desolate sections of
madagascar

  however though the background of
the story occurred against the struggle
for the naval base at diego suarez in
the early part of  the chain of cir-
cumstances which began this incredible
narrative date somewhat farther back
it is best that we start at the very
beginning therefore   

	 

there were some who said that
the sentence imposed on colonel
jacques chambreaux at the con-
clusion of his trial before the military
court in paris  was far too se-
vere true the handsome colonel had
been guilty of certain indescretions in
revealing matters of some small mili-
tary significance to the agents of alien
powers and true he had been paid
well for his perfidy to his fatherland

  but it must be remembered france
was not then at war and even the
thought of another war another bloody
draining conflict with any alien power
for the centuries to come was ridicu-
lous had not the final war been won
were not the enemies of france beaten
so utterly that they would never rise
again

  the colonel betrayed his uniform
his country and himself many said
but in fact he has not harmed france
strip him of his uniform therefore
sentence him to penal servitude then
exile that will be enough

  but the military tribunal was not of
this mind the sentence they imposed
upon the shaken gray-faced ex-officer
was that of lifetime imprisonment in
the bleakest of frances african penal
colonies lifetime imprisonment in
such a place was the same as a death
decree

  and thus in  jacques cham-
breaux ex-colonel of the french mili-

tary intelligence service looked for
the last time at the land of his birth
as he was taken in chains to the cer-
tain death that waited in the festering
heat of an african prison hell

  somehow through the bitter years
that followed jacques chambreaux a
gaunt sunken eyed ghost of a man
who had aged a hundred years in eight
clung frantically to life planning plot-
ting waiting for the day of his escape
and after ten endless hellish years
that day arrived

  there were three of them a thin
rat-faced gangster from the paris
slums a bald fat pig-eyed murderer
from bordeaux and jacques cham-
breaux

  they made their escape at dawn
and cut their way through the treacher-
ous jungles for twelve days seeking
the eastern coastline of africa a croc-
odile tore the leg from the rat-faced
parisian thug and chambreaux and
the murderer from bordeaux went on-
ward leaving their dying companion
to be eaten by white ants

  at the end of the ten days the last
of their water gave out and on the
eleventh day the big-bellied pig-eyed
bordeaux murderer collapsed in a
whimpering agony of thirst and fatigue
jacques chambreaux eyes glazed with
fever sheen stumbled on leaving his
last comrade where he fell

  on the twelfth day chambreaux
found the coastline and the small
scantily provisioned boat that had been
left there by natives whod been bribed
before the escape

  he had done excellently succeeded
in the impossible hed had but a small
compass and a knowledge of stellar
reckoning but of course this jacques
chambreaux had once been an officer
in the army of france his training
had given him some advantage

  chambreaux lay there on the beach
madagascar ghost



for a day regaining his strength it
was all the time he could allow in spite
of the fever which was now raging
through this parched body he was
not foolish enough to think that pur-
suit didnt follow and so he dragged
himself into that small leaky open
boat and with nothing but his pocket
compass set out to cross the mozam-
bique channel to madagascar a dis-
tance well over two hundred miles

rjphe voyage that followed could not
be counted in days agony of fever
the broiling brutality that was the sun
a storm in which the small remaining
water cask was lost-these things were
each an eternity of torture for jacques
chambreaux it was through chance
and nothing more that his small boat
was blown into a desolate cove on the
western coast of northern madagascar
and it was also by chance that boat and
occupant were discovered by a band
of scarcely civilized malagasy jungle
tribesmen

  chambreaux was beyond delirium
when these natives carried him from
the beach cove into the jungle hed
been unconscious for many hours be-
fore they had discovered him

  and so the penal fugitive the
bearded skeleton who had once been
a colonel in the army of france was
beyond knowing or caring what was
happening to him as these malagasy
tribesmen eyes weirdly agleam in the
torchlight carried him along the jungle
pathway to the throbbing drums sound-
ing forth from their distant campfire

  chambreaux was dying the natives
were aware of that but the drums
boomed and around the fires the tribal
witch doctors waited this spectre of
a white man must be brought to them
for had not the tribal gods given this
creature to them

  the malagasy hurried on through

the jungle blackness toward those
booming drums carrying ever so gen-
tly this strange offering from the gods
the witch doctors would know   

aptain matsuki of the imper-
ial japanese navy was impatient
the blundering fool was already sev-
eral hours late and even though the
distance from diega suarez through the
jungle to this meeting point was con-
siderable the idiot should have reck-
oned with it and started on time to
arrive as scheduled

  the captain was tall for a japanese
lean and stiff-backed his face was
clean shaven even though he had been
here in the jungle for a number of
weeks he wore glasses a pith helmet
brown military shirt and brown mili-
tary shorts his legs to just below his
ludicrously skinny brown knees were
encased in expensive leather boots

  around the captains waist was
strapped a cartridge belt and a bol-
stered automatic pistol a canteen
slung from his shoulder dangled at his
waist on the side opposite the holster

  from a distance and ignoring the
pistol captain matsuki would give you
the impression of a bewildered oriental
boy scout but that smooth shaven
face was hard and his thin lips vi-
ciously sadistic in their set expression
of anger even the thick lenses of
his spectacles could not completely
hide the arrogance and fanaticism that
burned in his button eyes

  the captain had two companions
both lieutenants in the imperial japa-
nese navy as befitting their lower
rank they stood apart in the jungle
clearing watching their captain si-
lently and with a little fright

  the time passes hissed the plump
one of the two lieutenants a short
moustached young jap named kusha-
mo the time passes and that per-


fantastic adventures

son is not yet here our captains an-
ger grows great

  the other lieutenant small dapper
and as young as kushamo nodded
fearfully perhaps he has been ap-
prehended

  lieutenant kushamo shook his head
it is not possible he said firmly

  the dapper lieutenant tokamo by
name sucked his breath doubtfully
and said nothing to this

  in the foreground of the clearing
captain matsuki turned in impatient
irritation on his young lieutenants

  fools he snapped must you
hiss and gossip like younger sisters
dapper little lieutenant tokamo
coughed averting his eyes fat young
lieutenant kushamo removed his pith
helmet and mopped his brow with his
sleeve concentrating his gaze on the
trees overhead

  captain matsuki turned his atten-
tion back to the jungle pathway reach-
ing for a cigarette lighting it and
glancing again at his wrist watch

  and at that instant the breathless
messenger stumbled from the trail into
the clearing

ilte was an older man than the cap-
tain and the lieutenants he was
small almost incredibly thin with flesh
that was arriving at the dryness of
parchment he was japanese

  so captain matsuki snapped
at last you come he glared at the
breathless scrawny older man who
stood gasping before him

  i could not help myself honorable
captain the messenger gasped plead-
ingly much happens in the port of
diego suarez rumors are everywhere
and the french have doubled the
guards throughout the city

  the captains lips went flat against
his teeth in an expression that was
not intended for a smile

  the americans he said they
expect them eh

  the messenger shook his head doubt-
fully none know he panted some
say it will be the pig english who will
come but attack is expected and
soon of that there is no doubt

  then we cannot leave too quickly
captain matsuki declared you ar-
ranged for the boat that will pick us
up

  the messenger nodded that has
been arranged

  how far distant from here will it
be

  a day and a half journey the
messenger said

  the captain turned waving his hand
for lieutenants kushamo and tokamo
to join him to them he repeated what
the messenger had told him

  it is therefore imperative that we
return with the information we have
gathered the captain concluded be-
fore any such attack by either the
british or american dogs is made on
diego suarez had my suggestions
before the imperial strategy board
but a month ago been heeded japan
would at this moment be ready to
strike before the dogs of the united
nations madagascar would then be
ours

  you think the attack is coming
honorable captain plump lieutenant
kushamo had the temerity to ask

  captain matsuki turned on him with
biting sarcasm do you think the
words of this fool messenger are jest
he demanded do you think the fact
that i persuaded my superiors to per-
mit me this secret mission was based
on anything else than the assumption
that the united nations will try to
seize madagascar do you think that
the refusal of the french swine at
diego suarez to accept japanese or
german troops to help them should
madagascar ghost



such an attack be ventured was based
on anything more than their own re-
alization that the attempt is near
lieutenant kushamo bowed before
the lash of the captains words not
venturing reply

  but matsuki continued apparently
releasing some of the rancor that hed
felt at the stupidity of his superiors
in not realizing the clarity of the picture
as well as he had

  but you could be excused for your
ignorance kushamo you are after all
but an underling my superiors were
inexcusably negligent in not heeding my
advice through their deafness they
will find that the united nations will
seize this island before our forces have
time to act

  but our very mission put in dap-
per young lieutenant tokamo that of
finding suitable territory for parachute
invasion has been successfully ac-
complished when we supply the in-
formation we have gathered here to our
superiors they will be pleased

  captain matsuki glared at his under-
ling he had long considered lieutenant
tokamo almost insolent and far too
ambitious it occurred to the captain
that perhaps he had been unwise in
criticizing his superiors before one as
likely to talk as tokamo but his anger
forced him to snap a reply

they will be pleased he said
and able to take this island from the
united nations at great cost and at a
later date but had they planned to
beat the british or americans to its
seizure they would have found the cost
incredibly small the capture easy
dapper lieutenant tokamo said
nothing to this he smiled slightly
and the captains irritation and sus-
picion was increased by that smile
the captain turned on the messenger
it is decided then that we start at
once for our meeting with the vessel

which will take us from this accursed
island before it falls into completely
hostile hands you will guide us
the messenger nodded as you
wish honorable captain but perhaps
if we were to wait until nightfall we
would find that wed time our journey
so as to pass through a slightly danger-
ous marsh section by day

  we will start immediately cap-
tain matsuki declared in cold irritation
he turned to the lieutenants kushamo
and tokamo as if defying them to sug-
gest any other course

  i shall break our camp captain
lieutenant kushamo said meekly
lieutenant tokamo merely smiled
faintly again to the growing irritation
of captain matsuki   

  he british marines on the deck of
the low-slung little troop carrier sat
with backs against a series of starboard
hatch covers cupping their cigarettes
in their palms as they smoked in com-
pliance with general dimout orders
aboard the ship

  tension had been high throughout
the carrier all that day for all the men
were completely aware that they were
very close to their destination

  a wiry little cockney corporal voiced
the sentiments of his regiment conver-
sationally

  the blinking zero hours creeping
up on us mlads well have our spot
of action before another night is over
a canadian youth grinned at this
ive wondered what sort of scrap
those frenchies are capable of putting
up well know damned soon

  blyme theyll fight orlright the
cockney corporal promised theyll
fight to beat hell for the principle of
the thing if nothing more well have a
tiff of it

  they made a mess of it in france
the canadian youth ventured i cant


fantastic adventures

see how theyll do much more here
the cockney corporal shook his head
in france they was sold down the
river by their own politicians my boy
they was too confused to know right
from left an itlers panzers ran over
em before they found out ere its
different these ere are french col-
onials the best french fighters
youll find out

  if you ask me persisted the cana-
dian youth they ought to be glad to
see us coming instead of the japs

  the cockney corporal grinned if
you ask me they will be glad to see
us as is coming instead of them japs
but theyll fight nonetheless them
frenchies is all tangled up in their
minds theyve been sold out at ome
and avent got it quite clear now as to
wot theyre fighting for but theyll
fight

  the canadian youth grinned

  i hope so im itching for a real
go he declared

  youve not long to wait the cock-
ney corporal promised   

aston preneau soldier of
france lounged nonchalantly
against the side of a machine-gun em-
placement just at the fringe of a remote
madagascar beach

  preneau was calm enough for a man
who had listened more than two months
to the rumors of a possible attack on
this colonial possession of his country

  from his superior officers preneau
had learned to scoff at such rumors
and although admitting their possibil-
ity deride their probability

  not right now he told himself
not at this time we are not a strong
garrison but we are well defended
there are the shoals and mines and
reefs to protect any possible landing
beachheads from invasion

  preneau told himself this again as

he turned lazily to peer out at the heavy
fog mists that shrouded the beach told
himself again while wishing with all
his heart and soul for the simple plea-
sure of a cigarette

  ever since the entrance of the jap
dogs into the world conflict when the
british blockade of madagascar had
begun preneau had felt increasingly
the lack of such luxury-necessity items
as cigarettes true enough there were
occasional cigarettes to be had in the
shops at diego suarez itself but here
on outpost duty one had little chance to
keep a sufficient supply on hand and
now with his own stock already ex-
hausted over a week preneau found
himself rather wishing that somehow all
this would end the fever point of ex-
citement in madagascar had lasted too
long already the speculation as to
who would strike at them and when
had gone too far for mere speculation

  as for himself preneau felt more and
more with each passing day that per-
haps an invasion-by forces other than
the hated jap-would be a welcome
relief

  there would be the necessity of de-
fending french honor with battle of
course preneau knew this he had
been a colonial soldier of france too
long to think of smokeless surrender

  yes he thought aloud we will
fight if the british come if the amer-
icans come he shrugged perhaps
not but in any case we fight to the
death should the yellow jap come

  preneau speculated on how good a
cigarette would taste and realized that
the coming of either the americans or
british would mean a dropping of the
blockade and a return of plentiful sup-
plies for the garrison and the people
in diego suarez

  he sighed and stretched and turned
completely to gaze down at the beach
cove leaning on the sandbagging of
madagascar ghost	

the emplacement with his elbows

  to his ears faintly came the throb
of jungle drums he frowned the
malagasy tribe in this locality had been
hard at their stupid rites for over two
days and nights now hed heard
those drums off and on ever since then

  at least he told himself wearily
we have no trouble from them a
small boon for which one can be thank-
ful

  and as if in answer the drums con-
tinued to throb dully in the distance
gaston preneau sighed such an an-
noyance to one who slept as lightly as
he   

jphe small party had halted for rest
at a fork in the jungle trail cap-
tain matsuki sitting apart from the
rest fixed his guide the jap messenger
of that afternoon with a contemptuous
gaze

  tell me my muddle-head the cap-
tain asked sarcastically why is it you
find territory you are supposed to know
well so confusing

  the messenger eyes fixed on the
ground answered without looking up

  i have tried to explain honorable
one that something has been changed
in the trail markings the malagasy
tribe in this vicinity obviously is en-
gaged in some strange rites and on
such occasions they sometimes unac-
countably-perhaps to hide their tribal
camp-tamper with trail markings i
am forced to go more slowly than usual
because of this fact

  your hide will be worthless should
you so delay us as to miss contact with
the boat captain matsuki said an-
grily keep that in your slow mind
fool

  captain matsuki saw his lieutenants
tokamo and kushamo whispering to-
gether a few yards away his anger
grew greater he rose to his feet and

stepped swiftly across the trail until he
stood above them

  i shall find much to report on the
aides assigned me when we return 
matsuki flared neither of you has
been capable of anything but stupidity
and woman gossip since we have been
here

  the captain wheeled to the old guide
we must get on again there is
no chance for rest since you are so
slow i cannot risk missing that boat
suddenly as the others rose from
deep in the jungle came the throb of
native drums

  the malagasy rites again the old
guide said the drums sound nearer
than before

  we have not time to be concerned
with the ignorant monkey ceremonies
of natives captain matsuki snarled
please remember that and speed
your doddering steps ancient one
wordlessly the lieutenants fell in
behind their captain who in turn had
stepped behind the old japanese who
guided them along the trail the night
had deadened some of the oppressive
heat of the jungle but inside of a hun-
dred yards each of the party was once
more drenched in sweat

  the drums continued to throb cease-
lessly during the next two hours of
their trek and on two occasions the
old guide stopped as if listening gulp-
ing nervously before going on

  another hour passed and it was
shortly after this that the old guide at
their lead stopped suddenly in a small
clearing his eyes wide with fear as he
turned back to face captain matsuki

  he opened his mouth to speak but
no words came

  well matsuki spat

  the old man found voice the
drums honorable captain do they
not seem louder clearer than before
captain matsukis lips went tight


fantastic adventures

  of course fool what has that to
do with our route

  the old japanese seemed to choke on
the words he stammered i am afraid
honorable captain that we are lost
captain matsuki stared at the old
man for fully a minute his eyes flash-
ing cold hate behind the thick lenses
of his spectacles save for the drums
in the distance throbbing more loudly
now there was nothing but silence

  dog captain matsuki hissed
this then is the climax of your ten
bungling years on this island as a se-
cret servant to the son of heaven
the tribal- the old man started
but the captain had his pistol from
its holster in a split second he
fired from the hip twice both shots
burying themselves within a quarter
inch of each other in the old mans fore-
head the old man fell face forward
to the jungle path

paptain matsuki replaced his
smoking gun in its holster his eyes
flashing wrath as he turned on his open-
mouthed lieutenants

  we have our compasses he grated
they will serve us better than the fool
of whom we are now rid if we reach
the coastline we can follow the beaches
to the rendezvous arranged the old
fool told me its location

  lieutenant tokamo answered him
we have our compasses truly honor-
able captain nonetheless between the
coastline and ourselves lie swampland
and many lagoons it might have been
wiser to let the old man live since at
least he was aware of the terrain
captain matsuki blinked at this ar-
rogant defiance then his lips went
tight and his hand slipped toward his
holster his dapper young lieutenant
however imitated the gesture dropping
his hand to his own gun

  the captain will forgive my sugges-

tions lieutenant takamo said silkily
but i believe you have needlessly en-
dangered our mission and our cause

  captain matsukis eyes were fixed on
his underlings gun hand still held
inches from his holster he wet his
lips his eyes moving to the plump
round faced moustached lieutenant
kushamo young kushamos expres-
sion somewhat frightened nevertheless
indicated that he was playing a strictly
neutral role

  if you imagine- matsuki began
turning his eyes back to dapper lieu-
tenant tokamo

  lieutenant kushamos gasp cut off
the sentence his captain had started
the eyes of both lieutenant tokamo
and captain matsuki went to the plump
lieutenant

  kushamo was pointing jaw agape at
a figure standing in the darkness of the
trail bend just ahead of them pointing
and staring in wide eyed horror

  they stood there all three of them
numb with astonishment as a figure ad-
vanced lurching toward them as if op-
erated puppet-like by wires

  the figure was a creature of rags
and filth a bearded skeleton of a human
being a staring expressionless spectre
of a man and as he moved toward
them his lurching robot-like walk
seemed to have affinity to the rhythm
of the jungle drums in the distance

  captain matsuki was the first to
speak

  halt he cried who are you
identify yourself forgetting himself
he spoke in japanese now he repeated
his command in french

  the creature continued toward them
apparently unhearing and the captain
his voice rising a notch squealed his
command in english

  but the strange figure didnt halt
his deep sunken hollows of eyes stared
straight ahead his shambling steps
madagascar ghost



lurched ever forward the death mask
that was his face fixed vacantly on
nothingness

  he was less than a dozen yards away
when captain matsuki whipped his
gun from the holster at his side point-
ing it dead bead on the tattered spectre

  haiti matsuki shrieked or i
fire

tt was lieutenant tokamo who
stepped quickly in between his cap-
tain and the advancing stranger
stepped in between to knock the barrel
of matsukis gun aside

  do not be a fool captain young
tokamo grated this strange person
is unarmed he cannot harm us he
looks to be the ravages left of a white
man long gone jungle mad we can
force him to guide us to the coastline
the captain glared at his lieutenant
lips working in wrath and indignation
at what amounted to open rebellion by
young tokamo

  he is right captain it was fat
little kushamos voice that broke forth
now this strange person can well
guide us to the coastline through the
stinking lagoons and past the worst
swamplands

  captain matsuki did the only thing
he could he nodded shoving his gun
back into its holster

  perhaps you are right tokamo he
said i will question this person
but the captain had lost face and all
three of them knew it

  matsuki turned to the still slowly ad-
vancing tattered stranger holding up
his hand

  halt matsuki shouted in french
and for the first time the gaunt filthy
travesty of a human being seemed to
hear the shuffling robot-like steps of
the creature slowed draggingly then
stopped he stood there in the clear-
ing perhaps six feet from the three jap-

anese swaying slightly those sunken
eyes staring unseeingly straight ahead
who are you matsuki demanded
there was no answer the creature
still swayed stupidly before them his
death mask of a face expressionless be-
hind the filthy matting of white beard

  who are you speak up  matsuki
cried again

  there was a sudden croaking half-
human noise rattling in the throat of
the tattered parody of a man that
was all

  matsuki turned on tokamo what
did he say

  the dapper young lieutenant shook
his head

  i could not understand

  it matters not matsuki decided
can you direct us to the coastline
idiot he demanded

  the creature swayed there unan-
swering apparently uncomprehending

  again matsuki repeated his question
the result was no better the second
time tokamo stepped up

  we might make signs the dapper
young lieutenant said to indicate to
this mad person what it is we want
slowly then with infinite patience
tokamo began a sign ritual before the
stranger he repeated his gestures per-
haps a dozen times until at last the
sunken eyes of the thing seemed to be
aware of what he was trying to convey
there was another rattling unintelligi-
ble croak from the throat of the mad
person and a gesture that seemed to
mean a nod tokamo turned triumph-
antly to his captain

  the mad person understands he
said we must fpllow him i am cer-
tain he will lead us to the coastline
matsuki was about to open his mouth
in protest when the weird creature
turned and started across the small
clearing in the direction from which he
had originally come he had gone some


fantastic adventures

i

ten feet then stopped swaying looking
back over his shoulder

  you see said tokamo excitedly
he means for us to follow him i
matsuki muttered something unintel-
ligible and the three started out after
the filthy tattered spectre that was the
new guide the mad person on seeing
that they followed turned again and
lurched onward his steps still strangely
in time with the cadence of the booming
jungle drums in the distance   

ceveral hours had passed and the
three still followed their strange
guide through the tangled trail forks
of the jungle for the past two hours
the drums had been growing increasing-
ly loud in their ears until even cocky
young tokamo had exchanged several
pale speculative glances with his cap-
tain

   the mad person still shuffling at that
awkward gait remained ahead of them
pausing only so often to see that they
still followed and the route over which
he took them was rapidly exhausting
the three japs

  it was matsuki who at last ex-
pressed their fears in words

   if this route leads to the coastline
he grumbled suspiciously it is a round-
about one and those drums grow far
too strong to suit me he glared ac-
cusingly at tokamo as if all this were
his fault

  the dapper lieutenant returned mat-
sukis accusing stare you were able
to choose or not honorable captain

  it was then that the drums ceased
booming quite completely the utter
silence in the jungle was suddenly nerve
shattering

  all three halted staring at one an-
other wordlessly a few yards ahead
of them their spectre-like guide had
paused also as if listening

  and then kushamo spoke excitedly

  hear it ever so faintly the noise of
surf in the distance we are some-
where near the coastline 

  captain matsuki bent his head
yes i think but-

  the savage whooping yells cut him
off in fact they blanketed the trail
section in a bedlam of noise and con-
fusion shrill wildly blood-lusting the
shrieks came from everywhere around
them

  and then the malagasy were all
around the three jap officers mala-
gasy bearing knives spears and clubs

  matsuki only had time to grab fran-
tically for the holstered pistol at his
side and in the corner of his vision
he saw their mad guide the tattered
filthy half-human jungle creature
swaying there on the trail ahead of
them staring blankly at the ambush he
had led them into

  captain matsuki cursed and went
quite a little mad himself his gun was
in his hand kicking back with each of
the three shots he sent crashing toward
the tattered madman

  then stinking brown arms were
wrapped tightly around matsukis
body and he was hurled heavily to tlie
earth the shouting and shrieking were
even louder than before and the jap
captain knew that tokamo and kush-
amo were also buried beneath the ava-
lanche of brown fury that had de-
scended on them

  hideous painted faces leered down
at captain matsuki and thongs bit
deep into his legs and wrists and ankles
and then he knew that they were not
going to kill him-yet he knew and
wished to his shinto gods that he had
saved for himself the shots hed sent
crashing into the mad one

the drums began to crash loudly all
around them again and matsuki tok-
amo and kushamo trussed helplessly
to poles carried by painted malagasy
madagascar ghost



were carried off into the jungle dark-
ness

  at the side of the trail those sunken
eyes still staring blankly his filthy
tattered body bent just a little forward
swayed the mad person who had guided
them

  in his chest there were three separate
holes bullet holes from matsukis shots
a black ooze seeped from each of them
an ooze that was not at all like
blood   

rjhhe small landing boats slipped
silently into the coastal beach cove
the british marines crouching low in
the gunwales peered through the soupy
fog as best they could holding their
breaths and counting off the passing
seconds any moment now the guns
of the french behind the emplacements
just back on the beach were not in ac-
tion yet proving that they were still
unaware of the coming attack

  it was the hour just before dawn
the hour when the fog was thickest
steaming up from the jungle and in from
the sea the cockney corporal nudged
the young canadian beside him

  all set lad he whispered

  the canadian youth now unsmiling
face taut merely nodded the boats
slipped on through the water now
they were inside the cove harbor itself

  and then the drums boomed forth

  drums shouting savage yells and
suddenly three flaring fires shooting
skyward on the beach as if from three
gigantic torches the machine guns on
the beach emplacements began then
chattering a sudden angry stacatto of
death and the men in the small boats
slipping up toward the beach caught
their first glimpses of the brown
painted leaping figures around those
gigantic flaming torches

  they heard next the shrill screams of
pain from those leaping painted brown

  men screams of pain and death as the
machine guns continued to chatter

  something on the beach the cock-
ney corporal gasped something look-
ing awfully close to native trouble
those machine guns arent firing at us
the frenchies are firing right into that
swarm of owling natives

  it was all over amazingly soon the
savages still alive fled in confusion to
the jungle leaving their dead littering
the beach the machine gun fire
changed to tommy gun pursuit as the
french soldiers on the beach emplace-
ments chased the malagasy back into
the jungle the drums had stopped
completely and the gigantic torches
burned high giving the british marines
perfect assistance in landing on the
beachhead

  when the french returned from their
chase of the malagasy the british had
landed and had their garrison very well
in hand a few sporadic exchanges of
shots-for the purposes of honor-and
it was at an end

  it was then that they turned their at-
tention to extinguishing the huge cere-
monial torches which had been set on
the beach by the malagasy the cock-
ney corporal and his young canadian
friend were part of the detail assigned
to this task the job didnt take long
but it proved extremely sickening when
the torches were removed from the tops
of the poles

  the torches had been human bodies
scarcely recognizable bodies now true
enough with just enough left of the
charred remains to show they had once
been the bodies of three japanese

  papers found in the clothing stripped
from the three human torches and left
on the beach identified the japanese
as naval officers in the service of the
son of heaven there was a captain
matsuki a lieutenant tokamo and
another lieutenant kushamo


fantastic adventures

  and scarcely fifteen minutes after
this unpleasant task had been con-
cluded the cockney corporal and his
young canadian friend were assigned
to either side of the cove heads just in
case there was any further mopping up
to be done

  it was the corporal who sighted the
decrepit little open boat with the use-
less tattered sail it was drifting al-
most without direction just off the end
of the cove harbor opening and there
was someone in it

  the corporal shouted three times for
the occupant of the boat to rise with
both hands above his head but the
dimly outlined figure in the small drift-
ing boat seemed only to crouch lower
in the stern

  so the corporal was forced to fire

trom a range of twenty yards he

  couldnt miss two shots each bor-
ing into the skull of the boats occupant
did the trick and then the corporal
managed to bring the little craft into
the bank

  it was then that the corporal almost
lost his dinner for the second time in
half an hour the corporal was hardy
and a soldier but the charred bodies
which had served as torches were grue-
somely sickening enough-and this de-
caying tattered long-dead shell of a
human being that he found in the stern
of the little boat was almost too much

  for the body must have been dead
for some time the stench was hideous
the corporal identified his own two
bullet holes in the skull of the creature
and another three holes in its chest

  oo elseas shot this bloody bloomin-
corpse the corporal shuddered

  and then he wondered aloud and

ow did it get here

  he found the small wrist band then
green and moldly and he had to close
his eyes when he removed it from the
corpse later when he scraped it off
it proved to be an identification tag

  but by the time the corporal had
dragged the body in the boat around to
the beach for the inspection of his su-
perior officers it had quite impossibly
decomposed

  the corporals protestations were in
vain his superior officers knew better
than to believe that this body obviously
dead for a matter of at least four years
could have been in the state of preserva-
tion the corporal said it was when he
first found it

  dead men cant be kept alive for
that long old boy one officer told the
corporal kindly what you saw in the
boat was just the same decayed human
rubble you brought to us you must
have been the victim of an optical illu-
sion

  quite possibly the superior officer
was correct dead bodies shouldnt re-
main in the state of living bodies for
that many years then suddenly decom-
pose they shouldnt even though writ-
ten legend has it that certain tribes of
the malagasy natives practice the black
witchcraft of zombie-ism and death sus-
pension

  but later when the corporal told his
tale in the bars at diego suarez dis-
playing the green molded identification
tag hed taken from the corpse before
it crumbled in decay there were some
who blinked in astonishment at the
name on it

  the name that read jacques cham-
braux col mls

       this mirror couldnt be trusted it
       couldnt keep secret the things that
       were mirrored in its shiny depths  

the messenger boy looked up briefly at the small ultra
swanky lettering on the ornate solid-glass door

bennet-hastings  co

he sighed then pushed his peaked cap defiantly back on his red
locks picked up the manila-wrapped three-by-five package at his
feet and strode breezily into the lavish thick carpeted reception
room beyond the door

i gotta package he told the girl in the switchboard cubicle fer
a mister scott marlow he work here

the girl at the board smiled puf it down sonny ill sign for it
scott marlow advertising and promotion manager for bennet-
hastings and company sat at his very wide desk it his very big
office and doodled worriedly with a crayon on a scratch pad

  marlow was a tall wide-shouldered man in his early thirties his

                            


fantastic adventures

hair was dark with the faintest sign of
premature gray at the temples and his
friendly regular features and clean gray
eyes were at the moment wearing an
expression of sober contemplation

  when the trim lovely blonde young
woman in the tailored gabardine suit
walked in marlow looked up sharply
startled out of his moody concentration

  eh oh joan he said damn how
i love you he thought

  that letter to oberman and com-
pany mr marlow joan kenny re-
minded the boss she held a shorthand
pad and pencil in her hand

  oh scott marlow said oh yes
thats right

  joan kenny took a chair on the other
side of the desk put the pencil to the
ready pad and looked up expectantly
poor poor scott she thought that
she-wolj wife of his is driving him in-
sane it wouldnt be so bad if i didnt
love him so

  marlow cleared his throat and looked
up at the ceiling if i look at her di-
rectly ill blurt out everything i feel
about her what a hell of a mess this
is he thought

  clearing his throat a second time
marlow still looking at the ceiling
flushed

  what was that letter about joan
he asked embarrassedly

  their contemplated national pro-
motion scheme joan kenny reminded
him patiently

  oh yes thats right isnt it mar-
low said her voice is like cool clear
little bells he thought

  it was fully a minute before marlow
realized hed been off in another fog
and then he looked down quickly flush-
ing still more deeply

  dear sirs he said hastily

  that was as far as he got a knock
sounded at that instant on his oak pan-
eled door grateful for the interruption

marlow swung slightly in his chair

  come in he called

  an office boy entered bearing a large
three-by-five package wrapped in heavy
manila paper

  this arrived a few minutes ago for
you sir

  marlows dark eyebrows went up a
notch in surprise

  for me

  yessir

  thats funny marlow observed
he rose and walked around his desk
past lovely joan kenny i didnt ex-
pect any package

  the boy held onto the package as
though his curiosity wouldnt permit
him to release it

  you can leave it here johnny
marlow said

the boy flushed and left the room

  marlow had his hands on the pack-
age and it rested on one thin edge on the
floor curiously he inspected the letter-
ing on it

  for me all right he said aloud
then he grinned well ill bet-sure
thats it its from old julius wolcott
ill bet its a picture

  hastily marlow tore the wrappings
from the package then less than a
minute later he was lifting it to his
desk and propping it against the wall
the object proved to be a shining an-
tique mirror

  well ill be damned marlow said
ill be damned

  youve heard me mention old julius
wolcott joan marlow was saying as
he stood back to appraise the antique
mirror he had an art studio here in
town he was a dealer yknow i
used to buy a lot of things from him

  theres a note in the wrappings
joan kenny observed

  marlow went over and retrieved it
thats right he tore the envelope
marlows malicious mirror



open and pulled out a sheet of paper

  dear scott marlow read aloud
this is just a little something i dug
up in a deserted attic thought youd
like it traced it back to find it once
hung in the palace of henry the eighth
dont try to send me a check for it its
a gift

  marlow shook his head old julius
is in philadelphia now he mused
damned decent of him to remember
me like this

  ill make a memo for you to thank
him joan kenny said

  marlow nodded abstracted by the
mirror its a fascinating thing isnt
it

  it seems very old joan kenny
answered tactfully

  marlow forgot himself enough to
grin i dont blame you for not being
wild about it joan ive always been
a sucker for any antique my house
is full of em thisll go wonderfully
well in the drawing-room

  joan kenny was silent

  come around here and get a better
look at it marlow invited

  joan kenny rose and started around
to where the mirror was propped on the
desk the throw rug on the waxed
cork flooring took that instant to slide
out from underfoot joans foot

  joan gave a sharp cry and threw out
her arms in an attempt to regain her
balance and scott marlow moved
instinctively to prevent her impending
fall

  they found themselves hanging to-
gether in a mutually accidental embrace
some five seconds later

  marlow arms around the girl was
suddenly overpoweringly aware of the
circumstances into which the near-ac-
cident had placed him joans body was
soft in his arms and the scent of her
perfumed hair frighteningly near to
being irresistible

   it was then that they both turned to
 meet each others glances and found
 themselves gazing at their reflected em-
 brace on the surface of the antique mir-
 ror

   marlow released the girl quickly
 shakily then after making certain she
 had regained her balance

   there was a wordless interval in
- which they regarded one another some-
what breathlessly

  my marlow managed drawing a
deep breath my that was close
wasnt it

   it was joan agreed it was very
 close her blue eyes shaded the mean-
 ing of her tone

tytarlow reached for a handker-
chief and mopped his brow

   then with hands that trembled he
 lighted a cigarette

   they shouldnt wax these floors so
 heavily marlow said in a poor at-
 tempt at a casual comment

   i-ill make a memo to that effect
 joan kenny declared softly shall we
 get on with the letter

   i think said marlow a trifle thick-
 ly fumbling with his cigarette lighter as
 he endeavored to put it back in his poc-
 ket that we might as well put it off
 until tomorrow

  joan kenny watched him word-
lessly

   marlow ran a finger under his collar
 uncomfortably you have the notes
 and data for mr bennet tonight after
 the dinner at my home

  joan kenny nodded theyre all
prepared

   mr bennet was the president of the
 firm his original partner mr hastings
 having been dead some fifteen years
 mr bennet was generally not around
 confining himself almost exclusively to
 the new york office of which this or-
 nate establishment was just a branch


fantastic adventures

  the dinner is at seven marlow
said

  when mr bennet passed through
town or stopped in on a branch office-
even if it were the most important
branch office-it was just as if god
with wrath in one hand and promotions
in the other had deigned to drop in at
the factory of his heavenly employees
and the reason for mr bennets being
in town on this particular occasion was
his desire to talk with scott marlow
about a move that might mean a sub-
stantial promotion to him

  i wont be late joan kenny prom-
ised

  mr bennet generally liked to be en-
tertained in the homes of his more im-
portant employees and though scott
marlow was not the most important
employee in this branch bennet had
hinted that he would like to discuss the
new scheme at marlows home he
had advised too that marlow bring
his secretary along to handle what bus-
iness they transacted after supper
hence the inclusion of joan kenny

  youll be ready to get there all right
in a taxi scott marlow asked the girl

  of course she said but its four
now and ill have to dress for dinner
marlow crimsoned im sorry that
never occurred to me take what little
theres left of the afternoon off ill
see you at my house

  joan kenny nodded turning to leave
  joan marlow said suddenly

  the girl turned looking at him
levelly yes

  marlow seemed to choke tell the
office boys to wrap up this mirror and
have it sent out to my house immedi-
ately will you

  joan nodded ill tell them on my
way out she promised

  marlow watched her leave a sick
futility in his heart his expression
suddenly became one of wrathful self-

condemnation

  damn natalie he exploded

 natalie was scott marlows
wife   

although it was five oclock
when marlow left the office and
his suburban home was but twenty-
five minutes away in his roadster nev-
ertheless it was almost six-thirty when
he pulled up into the driveway of his
somewhat expensive residence

  the additional hour had been passed
in a bar several blocks from the office
where marlow had downed five scotches
in solitary bitterness and with no no-
ticeable effect

  natalie his wife met him at the
door shed evidently been waiting for
him

  she was an attractive woman with a
sultry body raven black hair and a
sensuous predatory red mouth she
had already dressed for dinner and
her gown as well as her careful groom-
ing showed no little thought and some
expense her eyes were so brown as
almost to be black and now they were
flashing angrily

  rumpotting again eh dear nat-
alie greeted him

  marlow didnt bother to reply he
took in the almost artificial perfection
of her appearance and mentally de-
cided that natalie would consider her-
self no little factor in successfully mold-
ing mr bennet into an amiable frame
of mind tonight

  it was natalies constant though
highly inaccurate assertion that what-
ever business and financial success
scott marlow had achieved was due
to nothing more than her own acumen
and inspiration on his behalf certain
it was that from the moment they
married she had started an endless
nagging comparison between marlows
position and the position of the
marlows malicious mirror



wealthier friends they knew and no
matter what success marlow achieved
the nagging never ceased there were
always wealthier friends with whom
she could compare him for her goal
was money and all that it could buy
even if the gaining of that sought-for
fortune meant driving her spouse to an
early grave

  marlow had known from almost the
second year of their marriage that
natalie had never loved him her at-
traction to him had been merely one
of shrewd evaluation of his potential
ability to rise high in the world of
prestige and wealth

  but stubbornly at first he had tried
to hang on tried to make a go of the
one thing in his life in which hed
failed for six years grimly reso-
lutely he had tried to fashion in nat-
alie the girl he thought hed married
and at the end of that time he found
himself loathing her waiting and
watching for her to give him just one
chance to obtain his freedom

  and in this past year wanting his
freedom had become an aching ter-
rible thing for now there was joan
joan whom he loved yet dared not
love until he was free of this bitter
hell with natalie

  now marlow took his eyes from his
wife and stepped past her into the
drawing-room where he removed his
coat and fished for a cigarette

  he was lighting his smoke when
natalie followed him into the drawing-
room intent on continuing her one-
sided quarrel

  if youd spend less time slopping
around in bars scott marlow she
said waspishly youd have a clearer
head for your business

  you might point that out marlow
said wearily to bennet when he
comes for dinner tonight he sank
down into an armchair

  its a wonder he hasnt found it
out for himself by now natalie
snapped

  marlow however hadnt heard her
he was looking across the room at the
antique mirror hed had sent out it
had been hung just above a wall table
to the right of the sofa

  when did that arrive he asked

  natalies glance shifted from her
husband to the mirror

  over an hour ago she said that
seemed to be the only place to put it
i wish you wouldnt clutter up the
place with any more antiques

  julius wolcott sent it to me as a
gift marlow said merely to keep the
conversation on this new tack its
supposed to have hung in the palace
of henry the eighth

  he could see natalie making a men-
tal note of that she invariably sought
to give the impression that her hus-
bands art and antique collections were
but the result of her own cultural per-
ceptions he knew that she would
draw bennets attention to it casually
that evening

  well if you bring in any more junk
we just wont have room for it nat-
alie declared

  marlow didnt answer he studied
the mirror another moment and turned
his glance away it was then that he
saw the framed photograph on the
bookcase he looked at it in open-
mouthed amazement

tt was an abominable picture of mr

  bennet wearing fishermans hip
boots a weatherbeaten fedora a flan-
nel shirt and a broad beaming grin
in his right hand he held a fishing rod
and in his left a net the photograph
was loudly colored

  marlow rose deliberately crushing
out his cigarette in an ash tray by his
chair


fantastic adventures

  where in the hell did that come
from he demanded quietly

  it arrived today natalie told him
mr bennet sent it himself a gift i
supposed

  and what in the hell is it doing
here in the living-room marlow de-
manded coldly

  have you forgotten natalie said
frigidly that mr bennet is going to
be our dinner guest tonight

  take that down and bury it in some
drawer marlow told her his lips
were set in a tight line

  are you crazy natalies voice
rose shrilly

  you heard what i said

  that will stay just where it is if
you havent brains enough to know
diplomacy when it hits you in the face
i have natalie moved swiftly over
to the picture as if to protect it

  ill have no such stinking hypoc-
risy in my house marlow blazed
and if that damned old coot has the
insufferable gall to expect me to dec-
orate my living quarters with his image
he can go straight to hell

  marlow stepped quickly to the book-
case and natalie moved swiftly be-
tween her husband and the photograph

  youll throw away a promotion and
a ten thousand dollar raise for your
lousy sense of moral integrity nat-
alie asked between clenched teeth
oh no you wont not if i have
anything to say about it

  marlow grabbed his wife roughly by
the shoulder and spun her away from
the bookcase he grabbed up the
photograph and holding it in one hand
glared down at it in white rage

  ive never licked boots to get along
in this world yet i dont intend to
begin now he said with restrained
fury

  natalie rubbing her soft white
shoulder where marlows hand had

left red prints looked at him wide-
eyed but said nothing she had never
seen him so furiously enraged

  marlow strode across the drawing-
room still holding the picture and
glaring down at it wordlessly pass-
ing the couch he paused and as if
acting on an instant decision brought
the picture smashing down on his knee
shattering the glass in the frame

  then he tore the photograph itself
loose and determinedly ripped it to
shreds face still white and mouth
grim he let the fragments flutter to
the rug

  have the maid clean up this mess
he said evenly im going upstairs to
dress for dinner

  wordlessly natalie watched him
stride out of the drawing-room her
expression was half of fright and half
of wonder   

xhen marlow returned to the
drawing-room it was ten min-
utes to seven and he carried a highball
in his hand he had changed to a
dinner jacket

  natalie had been standing by the
french windows at the end of the room
smoking a cigarette she turned as
she heard him enter her expression
suggested that she had decided her
husband needed to be put back in his
place

  i didnt like that nasty scene she
declared her eyes moving accusingly
to the drink in his hand

  marlow took a gulp from his drink
moving over to the wall table on the
right of the couch he put down his
drink and began to adjust his tie be-
fore the antique mirror over the table

  did you hear what i said natalie
demanded her voice rising a note

  marlow continued to adjust his tie
he answered his wife as he did so

  now seems to be just as good a
marlows malicious mirror



time as any to tell you i want a di-
vorce he said quietly im sick of
this hypocrisy

  he heard natalies sharp intake of
breath

  what did you say her voice
was suddenly harsh

  i want my freedom you dont love
me you never have this cant go on
any longer marlow patted his tie
and picked up his drink he turned
to face her leaning back against the
wall table

  natalies expression was one of
shocked incredulity and mounting rage

  so she said venomously youve
been playing around with some other
woman eh

  i was afraid marlow said dryly
that that would be the only reason
to occur to you no i havent fool-
ishly or not ive been quite faithful
to you natalie too faithful

  what do you mean by that
there was a sudden unreadable ex-
pression in her dark eyes

  nothing marlow said except
that im through

  the fleeting unfathomable expres-
sion left natalies eyes a look of
shrewd cunning crossed her features
i get it she said youre dropping
me by the wayside now that you ex-
pect to move into the forty thousand
dollar a year class ive been respon-
sible for every last cent youve made
when i married you you didnt have a
dime 

  youre being a trifle melodramatic
marlow reminded her quietly i was
making several hundred a week at the
time we married with excellent pros-
pects for the future unfortunately
you were well aware of those prospects
natalie you tied your wagpn full of
greed to a fairly certain star

  you louse natalie said shrilly
do you think im crazy if you try

to divorce me ill take every last cent
youve got ill ruin every last shred
of your reputation

  i was going to suggest marlow
said levelly that you divorce me
bring whatever charges you care to
i wont contest it and as for alimony
you wont suffer

  alimony hell natalie spat im
not going to divorce you im not that
mad just when your really big chance
is coming and as for your little lord
fauntleroy gesture keep it you
havent a chance of getting rid of me
unless i want it that way and im
sticking around

  marlows lips were set now and
there was a whiteness around his
mouth

  i was afraid that was the way youd
want to play it he said in sick anger
he downed the rest of his drink in one
gulp and placed it on the table behind
him he looked up to see a complete
change in natalies expression she
seemed to be staring over his shoulder
her eyes startled and incredulous

jvtarlow whirled and found him-
self gazing at the surface of the
antique mirror his jaw went slack
and he drew in his breath in sharp
amazement

  for there reflected in the morror
was not the image of the drawing-room
and natalie and himself instead
marlow stared incredulously at a back-
ground that could belong only to his
own office and against that back-
ground locked in what seemed to be
an embrace were the images of him-
self and his secretary joan kenny

  fully half a minute passed while
marlow gaped in numb horror at the
scene portrayed on the antique mirror
and then he whirled to face natalie

  her eyes were venomously cold and
the expression on her face was one of


fantastic adventures

savage gloating

  so youve been faithful eh scott
you havent another woman in mind
eh she grated harshly no one but
that little trollop of a secretary at
your-

  dont mention her name marlow
blazed swept by a sharp white heat of
rage in spite of what your rotten
little mind is thinking she doesnt even
suspect i care for her and while were
on the subject i might as well admit
that i do love joan kenny do you
understand that i do love joan
kenny

  natalie laughed harshly contemptu-
ously no wonder shes to be here
tonight dinner guest eh tran-
scribe notes while you and bennet dis-
cuss your business thats rich-you
philandering swine

  marlow clenched and unclenched his
hands fighting off the overpowering de-
sire to smash his fist into his wifes
mocking red mouth

  it was then that they both heard the
sound of tires crunching to a stop in the
gravel driveway their heads turned
simultaneously in the direction of the
door

  that might be bennet natalie
said suddenly lowering her voice but
you havent heard the end of this not
by a long shot you can tell that
blonde wench shell rot in hell before
shell ever sink her hands into your
money im more determined to stick
around now than ever before

  they heard the houseboy going to
the door and marlow suddenly re-
membered the incredible scene on the
mirror he turned back to it swiftly
the incriminating tableau had van-
ished the mirror was blank

  marlow gaped at it foolishly uncom-
prehendingly he rubbed his hand
along his jaw shaking his head be-
wilderedly he looked around for an

instant and saw natalie starihg word-
lessly at it also

  and then he heard joan kennys
voice in the hallway

  instantly marlow moved across the
drawing-room and met his secretary
just as she was crossing the threshold

  joan he said

  joan kenny was looking incredibly
beautiful in a black velvet dinner gown
her blonde hair was piled high on her
shapely head in an upswing coiffure
the only jewelry she wore was a small
string of pearls around her white
throat

  she smiled a little bewildered at the
tone of his greeting

 hello mr marlow am i on
time

  marlow had forgotten natalie but
now she stepped angrily sarcastically
into the conversation

 how do you do miss kenny
really you neednt bother being so
formal with my husband just call
him scott as you undoubtedly do else-
where

  marlow jaw tight said stiffly
joan this is my wife natalie

joan kennys soft blue eyes were
uncomprehending and she flushed
in embarrassment

  how do you do- she began

  and im going to continue being
scotts wife natalie broke in acidly
in spite of both your efforts to the
contrary

  joan looked wide-eyed toward mar-
low

  natalie marlow snapped -i
dont think youre feeling very well
youd better go upstairs

  but his wife glared spitefully at him
relishing his discomfort

  my husband has just informed me
that he wants a divorce she went on
shrilly he admitted also that he is
marlows malicious mirror



very much in love with you miss
kenny

  marlow was white with rage and hu-
miliation he put out his hands as if
to shake his wife then dropped them
limply to his side he turned to joan
kenny

  i-im sorry this had to happen
joan he said bitterly

  but the expression on joan kennys
face had changed now the doubt and
confusion were gone she placed her
hand reassuringly on scott marlows
arm but when she spoke she ad-
dressed natalie

  your discovery that your husband
loves me was probably as much a shock
to me as it was to you mrs marlow
ive always suspected the hell he has
living with you and for the last two
years ive loved him terribly you
dont know how happy this nasty little
scene you started has made me

  marlow was looking at joan kenny
with incredulous joy

  joan he blurted oh joan do
you mean that you arent just saying
that to-to- he faltered

  i mean it-scott joan said quietly

  natalie was glaring at them both
rage and suspicion blazing in her dark
eyes

  what is this-this act she de-
manded youve both been carrying
on behind my back for months and you
know it

  joan kenny looked at her coldly
im afraid youre wrong she said

  i saw it with my own eyes mo-
ments ago the two of you in the
office twined together like a pair of
vines natalie stormed

  joan kenny looked at her as if shed
lost her mind

  scott what is she talking about
joan demanded

  marlow shook his head troubledly
the mirror joan the antique i got

today i had it sent home remember
when you slipped and almost fell

  joan nodded bewilderedly but
what-

  that entire scene when i caught
you from falling and we were momen-
tarily in each others arms that
scene was on the mirror here in the
living room moments ago natalie
saw it

  but scott joan protested i
dont understand you at all what is
this whats it all about

  natalie turned and moved across the
drawing-room to the antique mirror

  i dont know what kind of a hoax
or trick it was natalie raged but
this mirror she paused to point to the
antique and suddenly natalies face
went ashen she placed a hand across
her red mouth

  marlow was across the room in-
stantly stepping up beside his wife
staring into the mirror he didnt no-
tice joan following him

  the antique mirror was presenting
another scene again but not the re-
flection of marlow and natalie and
joan who stood before it just the
image of natalie and a tall latin-
looking moustached young man in the
uniform of a chauffeur

 a rmand  marlow gasped our
    chauffeur

  its a lie natalie choked

  armand the chauffeur and natalie
were locked in each others arms in
passionate embrace their mouths
pressed hard together

  marlow wheeled savagely on natalie
you tramp he snapped contemptu-
ously you rotten tramp

  you-you cant prove anything
natalie choked backing away

  you said i had no grounds for di-
vorce eh marlow blazed

  you havent natalie said even


fantastic adventures

if its true you cant prove it you
could never prove it in a million years
scott the sharp cry came from
joan

  marlow turned joan was pointing
at the mirror the images of natalie
and the chauffeur were gone and the
mirror was once against just a mirror

  natalies voice was shrill defiant
i still say you cant prove it and if
you try to ill drag this blondes name
through the muddiest court sessions this
town has ever seen

  marlow went white

  im still your wife and im going
to continue to be your wife remember
that natalie said savagely

  joan kenny looked close to tears
and marlow moved beside her holding
his arms gently around her and speak-
ing softly

  joan joan he said gently you
poor kid this is why i never told you
how i feel im sorry you were
dragged into this joan believe me
im sorry

  the front buzzer sounded at that in-
stant and the three of them turned
guiltily to face the hallway

  thats bennet for certain mar-
low said

  natalie regained her composure in-
stantly she smiled at scott marlow
and the girl with acid sweetness

im sure we all feel that this is
none of mr bennets affair dont we
marlow took his arms from joan
stiff upper lip honey well
straighten this out later somehow
natalies smile was tauntingly tri-
umphant

  oh no you wont she said ill
remain as mrs scott marlow for quite
some time as long as i please 
natalie stepped into the hallway   

touring the cocktails before din-
ner mr bennet proved himself to

be an amiable enough fat red-faced
bald-headed man whose only apparent
weakness was his desire to monopolize
the conversation

  his voice was deep and rumbling and
his laugh which chortled forth fre-
quently sounded much like loose stone
sliding down a chute

  marlow sitting on the divan beside
natalie nervously sipped his drink and
smoked incessant cigarettes glad that
bennets conversational monopoly de-
manded little in the way of reply

  joan in a chair by the fireplace said
little merely smiling now and then
when bennet came to the climax of an
anecdote

  it was different however with nat-
alie she was the perfect hostess or
at least her own idea of the perfect
hostess she was alternatingly charm-
ing and coy to marlows boss some-
times the country girl blushing under a
sunbonnet and others the arch attrac-
tive young woman of the world

  sitting back watching natalies per-
formance marlow felt a nausea in the
pit of his stomach for he was well
aware that natalie was doing her ut-
most to put bennet in a perfect frame
of mind for the business conference
which was to follow the dinner all of
which meant that natalie had meant
what shed said about never relinquish-
ing her legal claim to marlow and was
thinking heavily in terms of her hus-
bands continued financial rise and its
effect on her insatiable greed

  when finally they sat down to din-
ner bennet was in an especially affable
mood and natalie gaily continued as
his conversational partner deserting it
only now and then to rope marlow or
joan charmingly into the conversation
she was the fond and loving wife where
her husband was concerned and the
aristocratically bending patron to his
secretary
marlow malicious mirror



  throughout the meal marlow and
joan exchanged mute suffering glances
enduring the torment all the less st
ically since natalie had placed them
nearest each other

  and when dinner was over and they
retired to the drawing-room marlow
began to mark the time element won-
dering how long and how heavily nat-
alie would overplay her hostess act be-
fore she realized she was holding up
the business conversation

  bennet was in the middle of a con-
versation concerning some of his fishing
exploits below marlow suddenly re-
called the picture that he had destroyed
the one of bennet in hip boots and
with rod net and reel

  it was bennets occasional glance
around the room that brought it to
marlows mind he wasnt certain of
the significance of the glances until
bennet himself confirmed marlows in-
terpretation at the conclusion of his
anecdote

  incidentally bennet boomed i
sent a little token of that occasion to
the house here when i arrived in town
today did it arrive

  marlow looked over at natalie who
seemed suddenly to have lost some of
her composure she gave her husband
a swift veiled accusing glance

  marlow cleared his throat you
mean that photograph of you mr
bennet

  mr bennet nodded smiling diffi-
dently it was just a little gesture
scott he said thought you like it
marlow opened his mouth to reply
but at that instant natalie broke in
swiftly to head him off

  it did arrive mr bennet she
smiled charmingly but it must have
been damaged in transit the glass
over it was shattered so we sent it out
to have it put in another frame well
really prize it you know

tvtarlows jaw went tight at this
glib lie he started once again
to speak and again natalie cut him
off

  incidentally mr bennet that mir-
ror over there should interest you she
said marlow realized instantly she
was trying to change the conversational
trend and had grabbed at the first
thing to come to her mind

  mr bennet looked over at the an-
tique mirror eyebrows raised

  we picked it up from an old art
dealer whos a friend of scotts and
mine i just begged scott to buy it
you see it has a simply fascinating his-
tory it hung in the palace of henry
the eighth she concluded

  that is quite an antique then
bennet agreed he rose ponderously
and moved over to the mirror he bent
forward to examine it when a sudden
startled exclamation come from his
lips

  marlow looked up swiftly then he
rose and stepped quickly to bennets
side the mirror was once again re-
fusing to reflect what was before it
once again it was portraying what had
been enacted in its presence

  it was presenting in clear damning
detail the image of scott marlow rip-
ping what was obviously mr bennets
photograph into small fragments

  the tension in the room was elec-
tric the silence pregnant

  well boomed mr bennet in thun-
derous anger well 

  marlow heard the sharp cry from
natalie as she saw the scene in the
mirror

  so thats what happened to the pho-
tograph mr bennet snapped turning
to glare at marlow

  scott marlows jaw went grim he
began to get mad i was quite pre-
pared to tell you exactly what hap-
pened to that monstrosity in color and


fantastic adventures

 bulk mr bennet he grated

   oh you were were you bennet re-
 torted like hell you were you had that
 fine yarn cooked up about having the glass
 in the frame repaired this is outrageous
 absolutely outrageous 

   my wife said marlow seethingly
 cooked up that one she cut me off just as
 i was about to tell you the truth bennet
 that silly lie was none of my doing

shut up marlow shouted
wheeling on his wif
marlows malicious mirror



  i have never been so insulted
bennet declared

  and i marlow broke in hotly
was never so insulted as when that
picture arrived do you think because
youre the president of the company i
work for that you can intrude yourself
into my personal life to the extent of
forcing me to put up a hideous colored
photograph in my drawing-room as a
sort of shrine to your blasted omnipo-
tence

  i pay your salary bennet de-
clared and a most handsome salary
if i do say so

  and i make more damned money
for your firm than you realize marlow
came back i earn that salary and
much more your outfit was an ob-
scure hole in the wall when i came to
work for you through my control of
the advertising department ive built
your business into one of the biggest in
the country and salary or no salary
a paycheck doesnt buy souls 

  your attitude sir said bennet
stiff with rage is positively astound-
ing

  it doesnt match the colossal gall
of sending me that picture marlow
blazed does the altar that goes with
it arrive tomorrow

nd suddenly natalie had injected
herself into the scene she was
white-faced with horror and her eyes
blazed wrath at her husband

  scott doesnt know what hes say-
ing mr bennet natalie said swiftly
placatingly hes been working too
hard hes near a nervous breakdown
he doesnt mean this at all  

  shut up marlow shouted wheel-
ing on his wife

  you can consider your present posi-
tion with my firm at an end bennet
boomed

  you can take the damned job and

go straight to hell marlow roared
in the meantime get out of my house 
natalie choked something unintelli-
gible

  bennet glared at marlow

  i dont need your job marlow
grated ill start out on my own itll
take years perhaps but sooner or later
ill run your firm right out of business
ill slam your company back against
the wall so hard itll fold

  natalie suddenly exploded

  you damned fool she screeched
at marlow you stupid louse throw
up everything ive slaved years for you
to get will you well you can call
another bet off i wont stick by and
starve to death with you im getting
out now

  natalie wheeled and left in a storm
of shrill epithets marlow turned back
to bennet

  and now that everythings settled
just fine he said let me tell you
something about this branch office of
yours it stinks with stupid ineffi-
ciency two out of every five orders
i give are countermanded by pot-bel-
lied superiors who havent had the
moss cleaned out of their muddled
minds in twenty years the entire
dump needs drastic reorganization
and now that i wont be in there work-
ing sixteen hours a day to keep it going
in spite of your executive board im
happy to predict that it wont last much
longer than a year

  joan kenny appeared at marlows
side her eyes were glowing

  will you need a sort of secretary
and assistant scott she asked
marlow looked down at her

  huh

  in the business youre going to
start she said ill work for nothing
until you can get going

  marlow suddenly relaxed and the
rage left him he grinned and patted


fantastic adventures

joans shoulder

  youll work for nothing he said
but in the capacity of the new mrs
marlow i expect well be hearing from
natalie in reno in a few weeks now
that im starting from scratch again
he looked up at bennet the grin
leaving his face

  now if youll leave bennet he
said quietly

  but mr bennet was beaming he
was beaming and his hand was extended
to marlow

  putre there scott he suggested

tvtarlow gazed blankly at his for-
     mer employer

  i dont get you he
shake hands bennet told him on
a damned fine bargain

 but- marlow stammered he
was clearly bewildered

  i havent backed down from my
original statement bennet said with
mock severity

  look said marlow bewilderedly
i thought this was all settled i
thought id made myself perfectly clear
to you everything i said still goes
and what i said-at least to the
effect that you can consider your pres-
ent position with my firm at an end-
still goes bennet said

  thats fine said marlow now
goodbye he still disregarded ben-
nets outstretched hand

  perhaps grinned mr bennet i
had better stop being coy that pho-
tograph i sent this afternoon was ex-
actly as you described it a hideous
monstrosity no one knows it better
than i and my expecting you to
mount it fawningly in a conspicuous
place in the room for me to see to-
night was also as you described it co-
lossal gall i was praying that youd
refuse to do so

  wait a minute said marlow you

were praying that i refuse to do so
exactly said bennet it was a
test a somewhat outlandish test ill
grant you but by it i expected to test
your moral integrity your get-up-and-
gumption briefly your honesty and
guts you see i know you have brains
you wouldnt be where you are with
my company now if you didnt have
but i didnt know much about your
character for all i knew you might
have been a hypocritical yes-man a
boot-licker had you placed that pic-
ture on display for me id have been
sure that you werent the man i
wanted

  the man you wanted it was
joan who broke in

  the man i want to step into my
shoes as president of bennet-hastings
and company explained mr bennet
im stepping out im sick of the
grind and getting old you scott will
succeed me as head of the firm

  scott marlow grinned

  thats a big job mr bennet he
said

  youve just proved to me youre a
big man scott bennet grinned
lord what a going over you gave
me

  marlow suddenly snapped his fin-
gers

  ill take the job he said on one
condition	

  bennet looked surprised and
whats that

  that you officially fire me from my
present job right now marlow said
and that i dont take the presidency
of the firm until seven weeks from
now ill take a vacation from now
until then but i wont be on your pay-
roll until i take over

  bennet frowned i suppose if thats
the way you want it he began

  marlow smiled you see it takes
six weeks to get a reno divorce and
marlows malicious mirror



i know natalie well enough to know
shes headed for there right now if
she knew about this shed change her
mind

  bennet looked from joan to scott
marlow and smiled benignly

  that is a very shrewd idea scott
he said suddenly a peculiar expres-
sion came across his face he snapped
his fingers good god

  whats wrong marlow asked

  that mirror mr bennet said
im just this moment beginning to
realize what it did 

  scott marlow nodded soberly an
incredible thing he admitted gazing
reflectively at the antique mirror on the
wall

  but how on earth bennet pro-
tested

  marlow shrugged ill be damned
if i know he said

 mr bennet shuddered ill be

germ

a few years ago professor a fleming of
the st marys hospital in london was
conducting some research on colonies of
different germs that were growing on some spe-
cially prepared plates

  one day he noticed that through someones
carelessness a mold had developed on one of the
plates he examined the plate and found the
mold resembled those formed on very stale bread
or cheese and as an experiment he left the mold
and germs on the plate and started to observe the
reaction he noted that the mold prevented the
germ culture from growing and even started to
kill the germs a further observation was made
that the mold called penicillium was fatal to
only certain germs while other germs could live
when associated with it

  with these observations on penicillium com-
pleted a suggestion was made that perhaps the
mold be used to destroy harmful germs in the
human body others suggested that an antiseptic
be prepared that would contain the germ-killing
substance found in penicillium and use this as the
germ killer

  a group of men was carefully chosen with pro-
fessor florey of oxford university as supervisor
to isolate this germ-killing substance and put it
to work hundreds of experiments were per-

damned if i want to know he de-
clared   

       course scott marlow and joan
never did know exactly for the
antique mirror didnt tell tales any
more at least during the next weeks
in which it remained in marlows pos-
session it didnt possibly because
marlow didnt give it any further op-
portunity it still looked decidedly
ominously potential however espe-
cially on the day when word arrived
that natalies divorce was final and
that shed married an oil tycoon shed
met while waiting in reno for the final
decree ten minutes after the courts
had severed her old marriage

  for that was the day scott marlow
 and joan smiling maliciously had
 crated the mirror and shipped it anony-
 mously as a wedding present to nat-
 alies new husband   

killer

 formed but at last the substance having the anti-
 septic powers was extracted from the mold the
 substance was called penicillin and it was found to
 be one of the most powerful killers of germs both
 inside and outside of the human body its anti-
 septic qualities were even superior to sulfanil-
 amide which had just recently come into promi-
 nence as a germ-killer

   not only is penicillin a powerful germicide it
 is also the safest one yet discovered it kills the
 germs without injuring the body it can be di-
 luted as much as one part in a million without
 losing its effectiveness it can be taken orally
 or injected into the vein when necessary more-
 over it can be used over and over to kill germs
 this is possible since penicillin enters the urine
 after it has killed the germs and can be reclaimed
 by a chemist

   the only difficulty encountered thus far is the
 scarcity of penicillin there is not enough of the
 right kind of mold to yield the desired amount
 and thus research has begun to uncover new
 sources

   chemists are hopeful that they can produce it
 synthetically by studying its chemical composi-
 tion when they are successful it will be a great
 boon to medical science
    it was a saying that life refused to relax its
    claim to the bodies of those to whom death
    came violently- but in this coffin had been both
    violent and natural death-and both came back

                                             
 a lan wilcox was about to re-
 za enter his lonely house on the
 dune when he saw it

  the sheer unexpectedness of it held
him there transfixed his hand frozen
on the doorknob his black eyes wid-
ened then narrowed with his effort to
pierce the rapidly-thickening curtain
of november fog

  no his eyes were playing no tricks on
him it was a gray hearse he saw
swinging off the little-traveled main
highway splashing recklessly through
the ruts of the long ever-green-bor-
dered driveway leading to his house

incredibly there was lifecoming tothat
chalky face-life and a strange terror

  a chill ran over alans lithe body as
he watched the hearse racing toward
him there was something unseemly
about such haste in a car meant to
move with measured pace on its somber
journeys the pines dripping branches
tried to bar its passage the fog parted
before it in ragged reluctance as if
seeking to retard its progress with futile
ghost-fingers of gray

  but the hearse came on without
slackening its speed rocking irrever-
ently on its luxurious springs

  alan became aware of his fingers
aching from their unconscious death-
grip on the doorknob again that om-
inous chill of foreboding played up his
spine then he swore softly

  in a flash of clairvoyance he sensed
that the approach of this hearse was
bound up in some way with the crate




fantastic adventures



which had arrived a week before the
crate consigned to him from china by
piet van druten this mysterious ob-
long of raw wood was even now rest-
ing on trestles in his library facing the
lake at the back of the house

  alan stepped back in the shelter of
the portico to avoid the spray of icy
water as the hearse swept up

  piet van druten leaped from the
drivers seat his sparse tan-colored
hair was uncovered his dome-like
forehead and pear-shaped face glistened
in the half-light

  alan good man you got my
wire

   i got it but i cant say i understand
it alan came forward extending a
hand feeling again all the old pull of
vans febrile vitality what devils
work are you up to now

  body-snatching hi-jacking a
hearse vans nasal voice was clipped
matter-of-fact quick man help me
i cant stop to explain now but im
on the trail of the biggest thing in the
world 

  alan remembered vans cryptic tele-
gram sent from seattle

 consigning crate to you
imperative do not open till
my arrival above all do
not talk

  hed had telegrams like that from
van before and they were always the
fore-runners of some weird adventures
van was not the stolid phlegmatic
dutchman of fiction but a man of
great personal magnetism and immense
nervous energy-a heritage no doubt
from his javanese mother

  possessed of an adequate income he
roamed the world in search of the exotic
and unusual appearing at intervals
only to be off once more on another
wild tangent now hed turned up
again but this time-

  i dont like this van alan

frowned what are you letting me in
for

  he felt vans strong fingers bite into
his shoulders the steel gray eyes bored
into his youve never failed me be-
fore alan you cant now come on
i need your help

tte ran to the rear of the hearse
opened the door alan followed
unwillingly in time to see him pull a
dark oak casket from the interior

  grab the other end of this van
ordered well get it into the hall
they staggered under its weight
maneuvered it into the house only with
considerable difficulty when it was
placed on the hall floor van rubbed
his long chin thoughtfully

that pier of yours out there-
alan watched him narrowly if its
the launch you want its moored to it
van shook his head i dont want
the launch how deep is the water at
the end of the pier

  fifty feet

  fine now if you have a length
of light strong rope-

  when it was produced van led alan
outside the fog was so thick by now
they couldnt see twenty feet ahead of
them van stood back motioned alan
into the drivers seat

  you know the terrain he said
back this thing and get it down onto
the pier

  the motor sprang to quiet life under
alans toe he felt like a robot as he
obeyed unquestioningly van always
had this effect on him he remembered
he backed the hearse half-turned it
and then they were slipping and lurch-
ing down the wet slope to the point
where the pier began

  stop van cried

  alan pressed the brake the wheels
skidded in the soft sand then gripped
the front tires of the hearse rested
the manchu coffin



on the boards of the pier alan got
out somewhere ahead was the vast
expanse of the lake invisible in the
fog but he could hear the soft lapping
of the waters above the doleful mourn-
ing of the wind

  a lucky break for me that you chose
this lonely spot to write your novel
in vans voice came muffled he was
busy with the rope lashing the steering
wheel fast why did you build this
pier so long

  i didnt build it the former owner
did to accommodate a yacht

  bless his plutocratic heart van
said feelingly its length and width
come in damned handy now

  as if hypnotized alan watched van
put the hearse in gear saw it leap for-
ward heard the loose boards of the
pier clatter under its weight in a gar-
gantuan tap-dance the car gathered
speed as it vanished into the curtain
of fog the purr of the motor rose to a
whine alan could feel the whole pier
shaking under his feet there was an
angry roar from the racing motor a
gigantic splash then silence

  the silence came as an actual phys-
ical impact after the racket and suc-
ceeded in jerking alan from the curious
lethargy that held him

  he started to run toward the end of
the pier van van

an answering hail checked his
terror halfway down the pier the
tall angular figure of van druten
loomed up out of the surrounding fog

  hold everything alan i jumped
im okay

  the hearse

  where theyll never trace it now
but fll send the undertaker money
anonymously to replace its loss

  alan felt belated anger surge through
him he caught van by the arm jerked
him around what the helps the mean-

ing of this hocus-pocus i want an ex-
planation-and i mean now

  van shrugged youll get it i tell
you but at least wait till we get back
to the house im chilled through

  in silence they climbed the long ramp
leading from the dock to the house the
hand-rails were dripping wet under
their touch though the ramps slope
was gradual alans leg-muscles ached
with the effort to keep upright on the
slippery concrete

  back in the hall he indicated the
oaken casket whose body is in that
frederic robles

  the scientist good god van he
was famous alan stared appalled
youll have the whole country search-
ing for the man who snatched his
corpse

  again vans narrow shoulders
shrugged he said quietly it was
necessary and if im successful-
he broke off but first that crate i
shipped you from china it came
thats another thing alan cried
hotly that damned crate gives me the
creeps i could swear a knocking has
come from it at intervals

  a knocking ah  a light glowed
at the back of vans gray eyes every
four hours eh

  alan stared how did you know
then his voice went heavy with sar-
casm i suppose theres another corpse
in that

  yes

  wkat alans jaw dropped to
think hed been sitting chummily every
day for a week with a cadaver

  van glanced at his watch began
pacing the hall feverishly another
hour to go he muttered theres
just time to tell you come on lets see
the crate and bring a couple of ham-
mers will you

  dazed alan got the hammers and led
the way into his library which was in


fantastic adventures

an ell jutting out from the back of the
house windows heavily draped in
dark velvet broke the walls on three
sides back of this desk on wooden
horses was the crate he remembered
how often hed leaned back in his swivel
chair and rested his head against it
despite himself he shuddered

  sit down youre looking rocky
van said as alan sank into a chair
he went on i suppose you think im
going crazy

  or that i am alan answered
grimly

  van nodded when you hear the
story i have to tell you will think im
mad but i swear its true and for-
tunately i have the means to prove
it

  yes

tan absent-mindedly stroked the
hammer he held a year ago in
manchuria he began i heard of a
village remote in the hills which was
populated entirely by people who were
dead

  deadi alan sat upright

  had been dead i should say and
given re-birth when their corpses were
placed in what was known as the
manchu coffin van broke off to laugh
harshly at the expression on alans face
i know how you feel my mind in-
stantly rejecteduch an absurdity too
but later i had proof that due to some
occult power inherent in itself this
coffin could restore life to any body
placed within it

  alan sat quietly for the first time
he became aware of the change in van
since hed last seen him two yeans be-
fore the man was haggard his eyes
looked haunted sunken deep in their
sockets and now his mind-

  alan shook his head imperceptibly
poor van

  he watched as van turned abruptly

in his jerky erratic fashion and went to
the crate his teeth ached sympathet-
ically at the sharp skreel-skreel-skreel
of nails being drawn protestingly from
wood he leaned forward didnt even
realize he was holding his breath as
van lifted the top from the crate and
the sides fell away to reveal its contents
-a coffin

  a coffin ornately carved its original
bright red lacquer faded now to a dark
maroon the heavy gilding on the
whorls of the carvings was rubbed off
in places and dimmed with age but it
still gleamed richly

  alan rose and came nearer in time to
hear vans whisper legend has it that
it first held the body of kung fu-tse
the philosopher

  through three circular holes cut in
the coffins long side the faint odor of
sandalwood came to alans nostrils
his ears strained for a sound but in
the deathly stillness there was only the
slight rasp of vans labored breathing
then from somewhere far out on the
shrouded lake came the dismal wail of
a fog-horn-like a soul howling in hell

  alan shivered

  van looked at his watch  we
havent long to wait

 for what alan wondered he
watched vans long bony forefinger
test one of the hand-made wooden pegs
that held shut the lid of the coffin it
moved easily but as if it were a signal
at that instant every light in the library
went out

  alan felt van jump a foot he him-
self after an awful moment breathed
again

  power failure he explained to van
in relief its happened before this
time of year the dampness gets into
the dynamo

  candles-quick van hissed

  alan groped his way to the mantel
felt for the twin sevenbranched candel-
the manchu coffin



abra at either end with fingers sud-
denly gone stiff he lighted the candles
in each gave one to van

  van whispered sweat
beaded his forehead alan leaned for-
ward his heart thudding against his
chest his eyes riveted to the coffin-lid

  they stood in a pool of golden light
the walls of the room lost in shadows
again they heard the banshee-cry of the
distant fog-horn and then-

 thump thump thump

ht wax spattered alans hand as
he took the candelabrum van
thrust at him vans fingers were work-
ing frenziedly at the wooden pegs of
the lid he was twisting them in fran-
tic haste    lifting off the heavy lid
   leaning it against the wall-

  alan pressed forward stopped ut-
tered an exclamation the candles gut-
tered in his shaking hands as he stared

  within the coffin lay the lissome body
of a girl clad in robes of nile-green satin
robes wondrously embroidered in
many colors with the figures of bees
and birds and flowers a spiked head-
dress glittering with jade in various
hues was on the raven hair slippers
to match the gown encased her tiny
lily feet

  alans eyes went to vans unbeliev-
ingly van drew himself up looked at
him from under half-hooded lids not
bothering to hide his triumph

  she he announced quietly is the
manchu princess tanni fah lo

  even as they watched the girls vo-
luptuous breasts-half-hidden half-
revealed by her robes-fluttered with
returning life a sigh came through
the parted scarlet lips

  the waxen lids lifted slowly and
alan found himself gazing deep into
fathomless dark eyes-long slanted
incredibly lustrous

  a long moment she returned his

stare and then she smiled the smile
tore at his heart something seemed
to pass between them-mysterious
magnetic he saw a faint hint of color
flush the ivory cheeks before her lids
again closed wearily

 wine vans voice rang out
sharply jerked alan from his spell

  he set the candlesticks down
grabbed a decanter splashed most of
its contents over his shaking hand as
he hastily filled a crystal goblet he
turned to see that van had slipped
his arms under the girls slender body
and lifted her from the coffin

  a curious stab pierced alans vitals
with a shock he realized this swift
emotion was jealousy-hot unreason-
ing

  then van set the girl down in a
throne-like chair and alan brushed
him aside unceremoniously to hold the
goblet to the painted sensuous mouth
of his incredible guest his arm cir-
cled her narrow back his hand tight-
ened on her shoulder his heart was
pounding

  the wine seemed to revive her mi-
raculously she leaned back in the
chair its high carved back outlined
her slender elegant figure her long
scarlet-nailed hands rested on its arms
and her gaze meeting alans seemed
to smolder

  he realized with a start that he was
staring what was the matter with
him he wondered he was gaping
like a fool or-or a man in love this
last thought nearly made him smile
love hed be babbling next that he
believed in love at first sight

   radually he became aware that
van had been talking for some
time tanni fah lo at least had evi-
dently been listening

  let me see if i have understood
you correctly she said transferring


fantastic adventures

her inscrutable gaze to the spare figure
of the dutch adventurer she spoke
english with only a slight accent you
learned of my suicide to avoid the
unwelcome attentions of a barbaric
japanese general learned that cer-
tain of my faithful retainers sent for
the manchu coffin and placed my life-
less body within it before their ef-
forts could be rewarded you seized the
coffin by trickery and succeeded in
smuggling it out of china

  alan saw van nod and tanni fah
los eyes narrow

  why she asked softly was it
your intention to exhibit me in this
country as a freak

  no no van protested hurriedly
to tell you the truth i hardly con-
sidered you at all my main pur-
pose-

  his eyes went to the hall where the
body of robles lay

  yes tanni prompted and alan
could sense that instinctively she dis-
liked and distrusted van

  van left the desk hed been leaning
against and started to pace the room
rubbing his hands nervously he
talked rapidly the staccato words rat-
tling like hail in the silent room

  war he began between japan
and this country is inevitable i know
its coming    perhaps before this
year of  is out and in time of
war as everyone knows our scientists
our statesmen our military officers of
experience are invaluable to us we
have them fortunately we have their
genius their loyalty their integrity
but there is one fifth columnist we
have to fear and he is one against
whom we are utterly helpless

  strangely moved by the fanatical
glow in vans eyes alan asked mysti-
fied and he is-

  he is-death

  as if it were death himself mock-

ing the fog-horn wailed again alan
saw tanni fah lo shiver almost im-
perceptibly as she stroked a long golden
nail-guard on one of her fingers

  van stopped pacing stood regarding
the other two in the dim candlelight

  when i heard of the fabulous man-
chu coffin the conclusion i reached
was obvious  to bring it here and
use it to revive the bodies of those
men so necessary to us who were al-
ready dead

  but why send it to me alan pro-
tested i should think youd have sent
it directly to washington-

  and earn myself commitment to
an insane asylum before it could be
demonstrated dont be absurd
van snapped my story would be
dismissed as the raving of a lunatic
thats why i couldnt wait for an ex-
humation order in the case of robles
i knew it would be denied me but
robles-dead why here was one of
the very men most indispensable to us
in the event of war when i read of
his death i knew i must act immedi-
ately there was only one thing to
do-

  steal his body before he was bur-
ied alan said

  yes because we must not lose
his genius furthermore once revived
he would be irrefutable evidence of the
manchu coffins power

  who is this robles tanni fah
lo asked and where

  come van said he picked up
a candelabrum indicated that alan
was to take the other silently they
filed out to the hall

hpogether the two men knelt and
started to unseal the casket while
tanni fah lo stood by her hands
thrust in the loose sleeves of her robe
they removed the lid the thin as-
cetic face of frederic robles gleamed
the manchu coffin



waxily in the light of the candles

  you knew of robles latest experi-
ments van asked

  alan shook his head tanni fah lo
stood gazing down thoughtfully at the
body

  van explained he had succeeded
in isolating certain high-decibeled
sounds inaudible to human ears-
sounds so shrill that with them he had
been able to destroy the brain cells of
rats resulting in madness and death
all during his lingering illness he was
engaged in magnifying these tones so
as to make them audible to human
beings

  and if hed succeeded alan asked

  with the additional aid of a pow-
erful broadcasting transmitter hed
have a weapon of warfare whose re-
sults would be appalling swift an-
nihilation would come to those it would
be used against

  but what of our own men surely
theyd hear-

  no robles had already perfected
soundproof helmets he had to pro-
tect himself you know during his ex-
periments

  then he did succeed alan asked

  no-just as success was within his
grasp he died however- van
paused looked significantly toward the
other room where the manchu coffin
rested help me alan he bent to
robles casket

  caught in the spell of vans story
alan moved forward but tanni fah
lo stretched out an ivory hand

  stop she hissed sibilantly the
jade ornaments of her headdress quiv-
ered with her intensity i should have
spoken before you cant do this

  why van asked suspiciously

  because it always fails with those
whove died natural deaths youll un-
leash something horrible- she
choked in her agitation was unable

to go on

  alan asked what do you mean by
something horrible

  i dont know those unsuccessful
attempts have been shrouded in se-
crecy spoken of in whispers i only
know that something terrible happens
its legendary

  van looked up skeptically from
where he was squatting by robles cas-
ket then he shrugged pointedly

  no wait tanni fah lo cried at
his obvious disbelief you must lis-
ten the manchu coffin is only suc-
cessful with someone like me-someone
who didnt relinquish life willingly who
didnt entirely loose his hold on his
soul his animus-call it what you will
but with those others who die natural
deaths the soul freely released in-
stantly leaves the body and nothing
remains nothing but the clay

  van said are you trying to tell us
robles cant be revived

  she hesitated no she said slowly
i cant say that so far as i know
its possible

  then what are we waiting for
van said briskly he rose to his feet
and went to the library to prepare the
coffin

alan hesitated tanni fah lo came
and put her hands on his shoul-
ders he could hear the rustle of her
silken garments smell the heady odor
of musk from her perfume

  you must stop him she said and
swayed toward him

  he put his arms around her but
he objected mildly nothing terrible
happened when we revived you and
arent you glad-

  her long almond-shaped eyes blazed
momentarily ah do you think then
that death is to be feared willingly
would i go back

  i wouldnt let you his arms


fantastic adventures

tightened around her her mouth was
a crimson butterfly beckoning him on-
ward he bent his lips seeking hers

  but she held him off you forget-
that i am of another race

  what do you think that matters to
me alan asked hotly from the
moment you awakened i sensed some
bond between us    something that
cant be denied

  oh no she said and the light in
her eyes was tragic no

  her opposition only served to con-
vince him of his feelings after all
hed known other women but hed
never felt like this before

  i love you tanni he said

  east and west cannot meet alan
you know that as well as i youve
only brought me back to unhappiness
she half-turned cried despairingly
oh i wish the manchu coffin had
never been its wrong its against
every natural law but i cant make
that fanatic understand alan cant
you- she broke off suddenly stif-
fened

  van was standing in the door of the
library watching them he came for-
ward slowly and alan saw he held a
revolver in his hand

  the lady might convince you
alan he said softly he waved the
revolver i have no wish to be melo-
dramatic but im taking no chances
understand this both of you   
robles is to be placed in the manchu
coffvnl

  alan said wearily put the gun
away van

  tanni fah lo met defeat with true
oriental fatalism i have done what i
could she said quietly

  van smiled and put the gun in his
pocket ill keep it handy neverthe-
less he announced now alan if
you please-

  alan shrugged this time they lifted

the oaken casket and bore it into the
library tanni fah lo followed from
the throne-like chair she watched them
transfer robles body to the lacquered
coffin and seal the lid   

at eight oclock nothing hap-
   pened

  van was obviously first uneasy
then alarmed perhaps there hasnt
been enough time he muttered half
to himself surely at twelve-

  it was as if theyd divided into two
camps alan thought he and tanni
fah lo on one side of the room van
and the manchu coffin on the other

  once alan went to the window
cupping his hands on either side of
his eyes he tried to pierce the thick
fog it was useless but the darkened
window acted as a mirror reflecting
the room behind him and in it he saw
that vans hand had stolen to the pocket
where hed placed the gun it was plain
that he was suspicious of some trickery
on alans part

  the minutes until twelve dragged by
like hours alan had to struggle to
stifle his rising excitement but tanni
fah lo sat like an idol at his side
their glances always seemed to be
meeting vibrantly and alan thought
he detected a new softness in her eyes

  van stood up abruptly one minute
to twelve he had to moisten his
thin lips before the words could come
his hands tensed into fists

  his eyes were on his watch when
he raised his right hand they knew it
was twelve oclock

  alans heart was hammering even
tanni fah lo leaned forward in her
chair but for all her expression re-
vealed her face might have been carved
from ivory vans eyes were glued
now on the coffin

  but nothing happened

  seconds ticked by then van turned
the manchu coffin



with a stricken face something is
wrong his words came in a sepul-
chral whisper it isnt going to-

 thump thump thump

  there was a sharp hissing intake of
breath from tanni fah lo van leaped
for the coffin alan right behind him
furiously they worked at the wooden
pegs had the lid off in a twinkling

  and again as they watched the mir-
acle happened

  but with an appalling difference
where tanni fah los revival had been
almost effortless robles literally fought
his way back to consciousness his
arms flailed the air his face purpled
his pale blue-gray eyes glared

  as he struggled upright alan and
van hesitated they had to force them-
selves to help him from the coffin

  robles stood there supporting him-
self by one hand his whole body shak-
ing violently at last the tremors
passed and the ugly purple tint faded
from his skin leaving it the white of a
dead fishs belly his eyes gleamed
with a cold awful intelligence but
there was such a total lack of expres-
sion of emotion of something-

  alan shivered there was suddenly
a supercharged atmosphere of evil in
the silent room

  van too was looking shaken he
seemed afraid of the man he had given
new life youll want an explana-
tion- he faltered

  the cold eyes flicked him before the
scientist said tonelessly no i under-
stand everything i- he broke off
went to the desk lifting the lid of a
crystal box he delved within found
nothing

  impassively he thrust the box from
the desk it crashed in a brittle spill
of sound

 lan and van looked at each other
startled the strange act seemed

so pointless behind it there had been
no fury no petulance nothing the
man was entirely master of himself
recovery seemed complete

  a cigarette robles said it was
neither a demand nor a request just
an uninflected statement

  van hesitated then offered his silver
case robles took a cigarette dropped
the case to the floor ignoring the
lighter van extended he took a packet
of matches from the desk applied the
light to his cigarette

  while van was still standing there
his hand outstretched the incredible
happened

  with absolutely no expression what-
ever robles held the lighted match to
vans hand

 ouch dammit van leaped
back from the flame the lighter fell
from his burned hand he held it to
his mouth stared over it at robles in
amazement

  is he crazy alan gasped there
seemed no other explanation t for such
a dispassionate act of sadism

  the scientists cold eyes didnt
blink

  behind them they heard tannis
stifled cry robles head turned she
was sitting almost lost in shadow
slowly he started for her

  before this inexplicable menace
alan backed to tannis side van too
retreated as though from some foul
thing sheer terror was a living thing
in the silent room

  alan held himself in readiness the
scientist came on without faltering
when his hands stretched out toward
the cowering girl alan leaped

  he hardly realized what happened
next the seemingly frail arm of
robles swept out it possessed a ter-
rible unsuspected strength the sheer
power behind the apparently aimless
blow sent alan crashing against the


fantastic adventures

wall he struck his head slumped to
the floor

  dazed he heard a low growl come
from vans throat van was drawing
the revolver from his pocket before
he could get it out robles was upon
him van was caught in a grip that
forced his arm backward and up-up-
up-

  robles face was not distorted he
might have been idly scanning the ad-
vertisements in a street car

  the revolver fell from vans nerve-
less hand a shrill animal-like scream
of pain was torn from him

  my arm    hes breaking it

   alan quick    the gun

  alan shook his head to clear it
crawled forward on hands and knees
he was kicked by the struggling men
his hand was stepped on twice before
he got hold of the gun he tottered
to his feet swayed there gripped in
an unbearable dizziness

  through a haze he saw that robles
hands were now on vans neck the
thumbs relentlessly pressing the help-
less mans windpipe

  alans shaking arm wavered as he
held the gun at full-length

  he fired blindly

  someone dropped he didnt know
which one he was sick he was fall-
ing   

successive waves of nausea
flooded over alan he opened his
eyes a slit a butterfly seemed to dance
before them dimly he heard tanni
fah los soft voice

  no he wasnt insane

  so you felt that too it was van
speaking i sensed a marvelous in-
telligence-

  but no soul tannis soft voice
stressed the words nothing to direct
the wonderful brain nothing to move
him to emotion i see it all now my

people feared and didnt understand
these seeming monsters they occasion-
ally resurrected and i-

  the butterfly swimming before
alans eyes resolved itself into a bit of
embroidery on tanni fah los robe
he was lying on a sofa he struggled
upward felt her cool hand on his fore-
head

  im all right he said thickly he
closed his eyes when he opened them
again the dizziness gradually faded

  vans hand tightened on his shoul-
der ive got you in to an awful mess
old man how were ever going to
dispose of the casket and-and that-
alan looked down at the floor a
still figure lay there covered with a
brown drapery evidently torn from one
of the windows by van

  ive been blind van went on
and stupid id forgotten the one
important thing-that new men will
come forward he looked down at the
sheeted figure these others have
served their time and won our grati-
tude theyve earned their rest   
and the new men will carry on though
the manchu coffin is a failure i know
now that we never really needed it
and youll destroy it tanni fah
lo queried eagerly

  van nodded but how weight
it and drop it in the lake

  no tanni said i have a plan
alan smiled up at her how beau-
tiful she was he reached out for her
hand she let it lie in his lifelessly
puzzled he tried to decipher the
strange look in her clouded eyes

  a plan she went on quietly that
will also dispose of robles body and
casket

  her sadness cut through alan like a
knife he felt something else too-
ominous foreboding but as if she
sensed his alarm she smiled and her
hand stroked his forehead
the manchu coffin



  reassured he asked and the plan
once long ago she said i read
of a viking funeral

  ah  a soft exclamation from van
who seemed to understand

   viking fimeral  alan repeated
uncomprehendingly

  when a viking died tanni fah
lo explained his body was placed in
his ship    the ship was set afire
and cast off from its moorings to sail
out into the sea bearing the viking
to-eternity

  i see alans eyes went to the
dark windows out there lay the lake
the waiting launch and the fog to serve
as a screen and in just a little while
there would be no trace i see he
said again and added theres a can
of kerosene in the basement will you
get it van

  van left the room and alan got up
from the sofa

  tanni alan said

  a long moment her almond eyes re-
garded him no mistaking their soft
expression now slowly she came to
stand before him submissively she
bent her head yes-my lord

tte understood she the proud
manchu princess was telling him
she was wholly his exultantly he
bent and pressed his mouth to hers
and this time she didnt draw back

  tanni youve forgotten that east
is east nonsense he asked when
this is over-

  he raised her head her eyes were
filled with tears

  when this is over alan-

  she broke off at a cough from van
standing in the doorway a strong
odor of kerosene came to alans nos-
trils erasing the subtle scent of tannis
perfume   

  the pier was a finger thrusting
through smoky fog the thick gray

haze walled them in tanni fah lo
insisted upon coming with them to
witness with her own eyes the destruc-
tion of the manchu coffin

  one at a time they bore their bur-
dens down the slippery ramp to where
the launch was moored again that
night van lashed a steering wheel fast
tanni fah lo almost lost in fog stood
on the dock and watched as they placed
the somber oblongs side by side in the
stem

  they brought no lanterns only a
large box of matches and a torch-
hastily fashioned and still unlighted

  alan seated himself behind the wheel
all right van the kerosene

  he could see the darker shadow that
was van moving around the stern his
ears caught the soft gurgle of the jug
as van emptied it

  okay alan

  alan started the motor put it in low
gear the launch moved forward
slowly then halted straining against
the ropes which still held it to the
dock

  the two men leaped out van lighted
the torch and threw it into the launch
just as alan cast off the mooring lines
and the craft putt-putted slowly away

  flame leaped upward bit a jagged
orange hole in the gloom the launch
was slipping safely past the end of the
pier gathering headway the noise of
its engine seemed louder than ever un-
der the low-pressing fog

  there it goes alan said softly
tanni look

  no answer

  tanni

   still no answer swift horrified sus-
picion sent his heart plummeting down-
ward her sadness    her resigna-
tion there at the end had she
planned-

  he raced forward van caught him
just at the end of the dock


fantastic adventures

  she knew it was hopeless alan
and that this was the only way
tanni
desperately alans eyes strained
through the fog to the burning rapidly-
vanishing ship was that a figure
standing there between the caskets
was that the gleam of embroidered
robes and a jeweled headdress

 tannii he cried once again
through an aching throat scarcely con-
scious of vans restraining hands
and then it came    tanni fah
los voice through the fog  a soft
call hed always remember

  farewell

vignettes of famous scientists

eby alexander blapee

sin aac fludosi

        he was one of the greatest of all mathematicians scientists
        and natural philosophers one of historys mental giants

isaac newton the famous english mathe-
matician scientist and natural philosopher
was born december   in woolsthorpe
in lancashire england the son of a small free-
hold farmer he received his early education at
the grammar school at grantham near by be
is said to have made little progress with his books
until a successful fight with another boy aroused
a spirit of emulation and led to his becoming htead
of the school

  at die age of  he entered cambridge uni-
versity he immediately applied himself to math-
ematical studies and within a few years not only
made himself master of most of the works of
value then existing but had also begun to make
some progress in original methods for extending
the science in the early part of  he dis-
covered what is now known as the binomial the-
orem and a lhlle later came the elements of the
differential calculus which he called fluxions he
also extended the application and usefulness of
the method of tangents it was also in the year
-according to the legend for which there
is much foundation of authority-as newton sat
in his garden at woolsthorpe the fall of an apple
suggested the most magnificent of his subsequent
discoveries-the law of universal gravitation
ever since the publication of the theories of co-
pernicus as to the movements of the heavenly
bodies the existence of a force of some kind had
been postulated to account for the movements of
the planets in space but it was left to newton to
state the laws under which it worked

  on his first attempt however to apply the law
to explain the lunar and planetary motions he

employed an estimate then in use of the radius
of the earth which based on the value of a degree
of latitude then prevalent was so erroneous as
to produce a discrepancy between the value of the
real force of gravity and that required by theory
to explain the motions and indicated only an ap-
proximate verification of his theory after going
over his calculations with the greatest care and
finding no material mistake in them he aban-
doned the quest temporarily and turned his at-
tention to other matters investigating the nature
of light and the details of the construction of
telescopes

  in  he had acquired a glass prism of good
quality and in  completed his first reflecting
telescope with which he observed jupiters satel-
lites in a variety of ingenious and interesting
experiments where a spectrum was produced by
sunlight refracted through a prism in a darkened
room he was led to the conclusion that rays of
light which differ in color differ also in refrangi-
bility and that in consequence the production of
a perfect image of a distant object was an im-
possibility with that kind of an instrument the
indistinctness of the image formed by the object
glass was not necessarily due to any imperfection
of its form but to the fact of the different col-
ored rays of light being brought to focus at dif-
ferent distances therefore it was natural that
he abandon the refracting telescope and turn his
attention to the reflecting variety which was then
unknown the instrument he constructed proved
serviceable and proved useful in astronomical re-
searches sixty years later the first achromatic
lens was successfully perfected by chester more

hall

  it was on january   that newton was
elected a member of the royal society of london
having become known to that body from his
reflecting telescopes and a month later his fa-
mous paper on a new theory of light and
color was read on the occasion of his installa-
tion in his paper he states that light consists
of rays differently refrangible and that colors
are not qualifications of light derived from re-
fractions or natural bodies as is generally be-
lieved but original and connate properties which
in divers rays are divers in  he brought
another paper to the societys attention on thfe
same subject stressing the phenomenon known
as the newton rings in connection with this
he formulated the emission theory of light on
the foundation of calculations made some years
before by descartes at the basis of this was
the hypothesis that light consisted of material
corpuscles emitted by the luminous body hence
it is known as the corpuscular theory it was
universally accepted as a correct explanation un-
til superseded by the undulatory theory about


  in  a new and much more accurate deter-
mination of the earths diameter became avail-
able and it is believed that shortly thereafter
newton resumed his studies on gravitation in
 his conclusions were confidentially given to
hailey the astronomer it was on the urgent
solicitation of hailey that he was induced to com-
mit to a systematic treatise these principles and
their demonstrations hailey undertaking to print
it at his own expense the principal results of
his discoveries were set down in a treatise called
de motu corporum but advised by hailey
he substituted it for a much more elaborate pa-
per which was entitled philosophiae naturalis
principia mathematic translated the mathe-
matical principles of natural philosophy now
universally referred to as the principia and
gave it to the world in 

  this work perhaps the most notable scientific
production which the mind of man had so far
brought forth was in three parts two of which
were devoted to the subject of motion in general
and its laws while the third is devoted to the
movements of members of the solar system in
the principia newton formally introduced the
ideas of mass and force and established the sci-
ence of theoretical mechanics as it exists today
in the entire history of science no single contribu-
tion of any man has been as important as this

  since  newton had occupied the leucanian
chair at cambridge and had taken an active part
in defending the rights of the university against
the encroachments of king james  who being
a catholic was not in sympathy with the liberal
atmosphere of the great institution the con-
spicuous part which he had taken on this oc-
casion procured him a seat in the convention
parliament in which he sat from january 
to its dissolution in  in  he was ap-

pointed warden of the mint and in  was
promoted to the office of master of the mint an
office which he held till the end of his life in
 he was again the chosen representative of
the university in parliament and in  was
elected president of the royal society a position
which he also held until his death being re-
elected ftr twenty-four consecutive terms of a
year each during this nearly quarter of a cen-
tury of political and scientific activities he made
it an invariable rule to subordinate his studies
to his public duties and yet found time to do
much work towards the advance of science one
of his most important works during this time
was the superintendence of the compilation and
publication of the greenwich observations

  queen anne visited cambridge in  as the
guest at trinity lodge of the master dr bent-
ley and on this occasion newton was knighted
about the same time the controversy with leib-
nitz as to the invention of tlp differential cal-
culus began in a review published anonymously
of newtons tract on quadrature leibniu in
 implied that newton had borrowed from
him the idea of fluxions

  the controversy lasted many years leibnitz
died in  but it continued to affect english
mathematics for more than a century

  newtops death occurred on march  
at the ripe age of  his remains were interred
in westminster abbey where a handsome monu-
ment was erected to bis memory in  at
his death a cast was taken of his face and from
this a magnificent full-length statue was made
by roubiliac which stands in the ante-chapel of
trinity college at cambridge it was given to
the college in  by the master dr smith

  tn person newton was of medium height and
of robust build inclining towards corpulency in
his later years though a light eater in his prime
his countenance which was finely and symmet-
rically cut expressed thoughtfulness and mental
repose he was affable and modest rather re-
served and dignified but without the least impli-
cation of hauteur

  newton never married from early manhood
he was always in comfortable financial circum-
stances and left an estate estimated at about
 which meant great affluence for his day

  at the age of sixty to sixty-five his health be-
gan to fail and while he did not allow the cir-
cumstance to interfere with his public duties he
began to abandon science as a field of thought
and turned his mind to speculations regarding the
future having a profound reverence for the
scriptures these took the form of endeavoring
to fathom the mysterious sayings of the books of
daniel and of the revelations of st john about
which he wrote rather voluminously but ap-
parently with no intent of publication in 
six years after his death hi scriptural studies
were published under the title of observations
of the prophesies of daniel and of the book of
revelations

by leroy yerxa

t ouie sam wallaces voice
cracked out like a whip from
-- the city desk louie ap-
proached slowly

 want me chief the question
was unnecessary he knew damned
well what was coming louies five
feet of skin and bones were never cut
out for a press photographer hed
been waiting a long time for wallace
to find it out

  sam looked up again from under the
green eye shade squinted and growled

  youre fired

  louie gulped he sidled around be-
hind wallace forgetting the momen-
tarily silenced typewriters and side
grins that greeted his downfall

  sam was studying page one of the
competitive city journal it carried
a three column blowup of the tony
rezzcheck funeral it was a nice shot
of a big-time gangster making his last
trip to the cemetery at wallaces
elbow a glossy photo spelled louies
last stand he had been on the rezz-
check job-had one camera smashed by
tonys playboys and finally come home
with a nice print of a mans shoulder
it was a clear well defined shoulder
perfect for reproduction purposes but
sam didnt like it

  louie gulped and departed

  the boys down stairs were very quiet
when louie came in he stopped at the
door lips twisted into a wry grin

  exit one lousy photographer he
said louie needed a beer he took a
few things from the locker pat mul-

lens stopped him at the outer door
looking sheepish

  heard you busted your box on that
last job he muttered heres an old
one i dont use much take it
thanks pat i can get along
louie choked and pushed past him
he couldnt see well in the sunlight
outside the light brought tears into
his eyes the post gang were swell
to a guy too darn swell he fumbled
in the baggy tweed coat and drew out
the last ten spot kissing it tenderly
louie headed for rays beer hall

  whatevers on tap he requested
and ray slid a foamy one across the
polished mahogany

  whats the matter ray looked
him over carefully you look lower
than a busted kite

  i am louie answered and slid
down off the stool the telephone
jangled loudly in the darkness at the
other end of the bar

  yeah ray answered it hey
brock he said its your girl she
says she expected youd be here

t ouie came on the double clutching
    the receiver to his ear

  kitty he questioned eagerly
hello honey where the devil are
you

  a pleasant tinkle of laughter came
over the wire

  hello napoleon it was kitty
wallace all right fresit and vibrant as
a lake shore breeze im in california
ive got such grand news i had to call


cat eye

       louie sot fired-and all he knew was takins
       pictures well hed show the boss so he
       bousht a junky camera with a cats eye for a
       lens-and took a pic of the end of the world

in a flash louie was down
the bank and lashing out
with both fists at his enemy




fantastic adventures

you at once-

  california louies voice was in-
credulously startled but he was singing
inside at the sound of her voice when
are you coming home

  kitty laughed again

  lonely

  im plenty low

  louie told her about the job kitty
was deeply concerned

  but ill be home tomorrow cave
man she had a way of saying it that
wasnt hard to take what ive got
to tell you will make everything all
right again

  yeah louie was worried what
do we furnish the bungalow with
love kitty answered and you
know what else-

  your three minutes are up the
harsh metallic voice of the long-dis-
tance operator cut in

  bye bye kitty said- lots of
kisses and im taking the plane to-
night

  the receiver clicked louie stood
very still for a minute listening then
he turned away toward state street

  caifornia he groaned a plane
   what a girl and what was all
this surprise business

  down the street he hesitated in front
of joes payn shop ten bucks less
one beer he went in feeling more
comfortable in the half-lighted shabby
room joe came from the back room
hunched forward with a critical eye

  mr brock he said with suspicion
in his voice i aint buying today

  i am louie said shortly he
started to paw over the collection of
battered cameras on the end of the
counter joe leaned over his stubble-
covered chin close to louies

  its a camera you want

  you aint got one in the joint
louie was disgusted but i might
take one of these boxes

  i got good cameras joe was rising
to the battle he pushed the best of
the lot forward a hundred-dollar
speed graphic this is and in fine
shape

  he turned it in his hairy fingers

  without a lens louie reminded
him

  so joe was unruffled im selling
you a hundred-buck camera for ten
ones without lens

  aint you got an old one i can use
louie was beginning to get ideas that
dead eye wont help any

  joe rummaged around in a grimy
box there was glass of all types in
it at last he drew something out and
screwed it quickly into the camera

  thats a good one he held it up
for louies approval

jphe box was tight enough-no pin
holes but the lens stared at him
like a cats eye it was pale green with
a deeper pupil-like circle in the center

  this is a glass eye he sputtered
drawing back what in hell you try-
ing to sell me

  now listen mr brock joe clouded
suddenly im selling you a hundred-
buck camera not the lens do you
buy or do i turn you around and throw
you out

  brock hesitated

  ill take it he said for five
bucks

  joe seemed about to disintegrate
then realizing he still had the upper
edge of the deal he held out his hand
for the cash

  give

  louie handed him the money and
turned his eye caught the twelve-
inch figure of a cat sitting on a shelf
above the door it was of metal and
black with age one green eye winked
from the head as though begging for its
mate
louies cat eye



  a very valuable number joe was
on the trail of the other five a gen-
uine egyptian cat dug from ancient
ruins price five bucks

  what the hell would i do with a
one-eyed cat louie shot back he
left the shop and headed up state to-
ward madison there was a plate left
in the camera an intriguing idea en-
tered his mind why not take a shot
and see how the world looked through
a cats eye in front of the first na-
tional he spotted an old begger lifting
the camera he aimed carelessly and
released the shutter

in the dark room under mrs sher-
rigans hall stairs he went to work
with fresh chemicals mixed louie
turned out the light and started mak-
ing prints of his best work some of
these were bound to sell the syndicates
cash was hash right now and he needed
food badly

  an hour later he stopped then re-
membered the plate in joes bargain
camera drawing it out he doused
it in the developer to louies surprise
dark spots began to appear on the face
of the negative the crazy lens had
worked sweat oozed on his forehead
and he bent over tensely the black-
ness was spreading and figures stood
out plainly he nursed the plate into
the hypo working carefully now he
washed the negative and placed it on
the drying rack it was too dark to
make out the image

  later out in the brightness of the
hall he looked at what the cat-eye lens
had captured louie almost passed out
there wasnt any beggar at all this
was a perfect shot of two coppers fight-
ing a death battle with what seemed
to be three bank robbers he sat down
on the stairs wiping his face with a
chemical-stained sleeve it was an on-
the-scene shot if hed ever dreamed of

one and what staff photographer
hadnt

  dashing back to the dark room
louie pulled down the enlarger and
went to work common sense told him
there hadnt been a robbery at the
first national in ten years he tried
to convince himself as he stared at the
finished prints that he louie brock
had seen this with his own eyes it
was no use hed seen one seedy look-
ing bum and that was all mumbling
he slipped the print into an envelope
put it carefully inside his coat and
headed for rays

jope pat mullens shook his
head i havent heard about it
and if the first national had been
busted open sam woulda had me down
there in twenty minutes

  thats funny louie had to lie
i heard a couple of guys talking
must have been listening backward
he gulped another tall one and thumped
the glass down with a note of finality

  next ones on the house ray of-
fered

  thanks fella louie climbed down
me-i need sleep and very bad

  pat looked after him as he went out
the door he turned to ray

  funny what losing a job will do to
a guy he offered louies acting
wilder than a tire salesman

yrhen louie brock woke up it was
raining the clock told him night
was gone by five hours and kitty
would have long since arrived by the
morning plane his clogged nostrils
smelled news it whipped up through
the smoky air of west madison and
brought his bare feet out on the damp
floor then he realized what had called
him from his dream of a thousand cats
eyes all staring at once

  a newsie was howling from the street


fantastic adventures

  hi-ya read all about it cops
fight gun battle at first national bank
three crooks killed hi-ya read-
louie was half way down in his
pajamas back up again he flung the
robe over his shoulders and amost fell
down to the front door

  hey kid he shouted bring
me a paper

  his heart was pounding safe in the
room again he read the first paragraph

  the first national bank was held up
early today by three unidentified men
who attempted to escape through the
front entrance with ten thousand dol-
lars only the speedy work of two of-
ficers on the beat prevented their-
he read on by jerks-gun battle-two
men killed-companion wounded
badly

  this was it this was the rob-
bery he had a picture of-but how

  louies mind was whirling he sat
a moment on the bed nursing a head
that wouldnt stop pounding page
one of the paper carried a single column
shot of the bank sam must have dug
it from the morgue at the last minute
he got determinedly to his feet

tvtadison street was a dirty spat-
tering mess of mud and rain
louies slippers squished through it
his pajamas were wet to the knee the
topcoat might have been some protec-
tion if hed remembered to button it

  in five minutes louie was standing
before sam wallaces desk the pre-
cious envelope was clutched firmly in
one hand he passed it to sam

  well well wallaces grin was car-
icatured by an ink-stain if it isnt
little tom thumb brock back again
what can we do for you sonny
nothing louie flared just take
a look at what youre missing

  sam opened the envelope carelessly
the print flopped out on the desk top

he stared at it a second then galvan-
ized into life

  how in- he started my god
man do you realize what youve got
here

  a gold mine louie grinned and
all for the journal

  sams expression softened

  no employee of the post will sell
his stuff to that crackpot outfit youre
hired again with twenty-five a month
as your first raise

  he rturned in his chair and shouted
like a bull moose

  ed call the press room and tell
them to hold everything junk page
one and get the engraver up here i
want a cut of this print that will leave
just room enough for the head and
caption he relaxed again louie
a hundred bucks for the sole rights to
this shot

  i oughta put in a clause where
youd have to take off your hat every
time we meet louie said bitterly but
maybe i wont

  thank you mr brock sam said
and left louie twiddling his thumbs

  louie sat down on the desk top
listening to the pleasant humming of
a city room in action his stuff was
opening their eyes and promptly in
the back of louies head that cats eye
glowed brightly he blessed it if
the breaks held louie brock would
buy a house full of cats

tt was a constant source of wonder
to pat mullens how louie ever man-
aged to get kitty wallace from the
grab bag shed spent the better part
of six months loving the half-pint
brock and pat was trying harder all
the time to see with his thick rimmed
glasses just what kitty could see and
admire today pat was more worried
than ever over the way louie had called
his shots on the first national job he
louies cat eye



looked up at least figuratively to louie
as some small image of a great man

  kitty trim and with hair of warmest
brown came tripping into the beanery
and sat down beside louie

  how-great chief her nose
wrinkled a little at louies seedy ap-
pearance you could stand a bath and
some fresh linen laddie

  louie groaned

  dont i know it he tried to hide
as much as possible under the edge of
the table i-ive been a busy guy
these last two days gee kitty im
sorry about this morning

  it was lonely at the air field she
squeezed his arm but i guess you
did pretty well from what dad tells
me

   her toe crept out and he felt its pres-
sure against his everything was all
right again

  my midget does have trouble
doesnt he pat

  pat chuckled id like to hear one
of the boys call him that he stood
up this is where i came in

  kitty grabbed his arm

  so she said sternly youd walk
out on us after ive been gone for two
weeks

  joe sat down again sheepishly

  me im always in the way he
muttered

  and a darned good place to be
louie included when we get that
want to be alone feeling well let you
know

  kittys toe pressed a little tighter
against his shoe he blushed in spite
of himself something about her com-
plete disregard for his physical short-
comings made a big warm spot in
louies heart

  you wont even ask if i had a nice
trip she pouted a very little her
amazing light green eyes twinkling with
mystery well anyhow im home

i have a big surprise for you in just
a few days and now lets have some
spaghetti

  listen honey dont you think i
oughta know about this secret louie
was wearing down its been two
weeks-

  you will cave man when i get good
and ready to tell you

  the spaghetti came dripping with
meat sauce and the incident was closed
kitty was like that

gome hours later pleasantly smeared
with lipstick and smelling pleas-
antly of kittys perfume louie brock
sat on a bench behind the park central
hotel it had been a long time since
his nose had met on even terms with
kitty wallaces the experience had
been an old thrill renewed with excit-
ing promises for days to come louie
felt fine a swell girl kitty and a
swell job with a cats eye camera he
had everything

  louie thought about the camera
something and that was all he could
call it was making that camera register
a scene just twenty-four hours before
it actually happened that something
was making an actual prediction and
backing it up in black and white some-
thing that had to do with egypt and
history back at the time mummies were
going around under their own power
black magic and right under louie
brocks arm

  hed have to be careful if the
gang found out he wasnt playing fair
with them 

  a new camera that was the thing
buy a new camera for everyday shots
and keep the cats-eye model out of
sight no good taking a picture of a
visiting celebrity only to find he had a
print of the empty railroad station
twenty-four hours after said celeb had
vanished


fantastic adventures

tvforning and with the sun in his
face louie felt better he drove
the chevrolet along slowly the state
highway passed under him with the
smooth click of tar strips against his
tires the cry of the newsboys still
rang pleasantly in his ears pic of the
century they called his shot of the
first national robbery life look
black star all wanted him on the staff
kitty was the one thing that held him
on the post staff a mighty firm an-
chor at that kitty surprise or no
was about all one man could ask

  louie enjoyed the assignment this
morning

  theres an old screwball about eight
miles west of town just off the main
drag sam had told him he thinks
the world is going to end this week
after that pic you brought in im
not so sure but what hes right at
least it will make good sunday supple-
ment stuff go out and bring him back
alive

  louie turned off the highway at state-
ville and followed his nose down be-
yond the railroad tracks here in a
secluded gully washed out by a muddy
creek the prophet had built his ark
noah had nothing on this boy louie
thought as he climbed out of the car
the ark was made from what was left
of an old life boat it had been decked
over with old timber and sheet metal
top-side it groaned under a small tar-
paper shack this was the prophets
living quarters which he shared with
an unholy assortment of goats pigs
dogs and cats

  louie stood on the bank for a min-
ute looked at the smooth soft yellow
clay below and wondered how hed get
down the prophet came out and
brocks camera mind saw some nice
shots immediately the old gent was
good material any day in the week he
had a gunny sack wrapped and tied

around his center overlapped by about
three feet of whiskers that was all

  he propped one skinny shank against
the side of the boat and surveyed
louies slight form

  welcome son his washed out blue
eyes kindled with interest and the high
quaver of a voice was friendly wel-
come to salvation

  louie unlimbered the new speed
graphic hed purchased that morning
and gathering up the cats-eye model
started down the bank he slipped
and riding on his back hit the bottom
with a muddy thump he came up
sputtering the prophet was properly
shocked

  tut tut my son he admonished
such language is in vain

it wasnt louie said it did me
a lot of good say im out here to get
some pictures of you how about it
the prophets chin slipped a notch
and his eyes clouded

  verily he muttered i had hoped
some poor sinner had seen the light i
felt that you were sent to join my heav-
enly caravan

hphen he saw the press card that
louie was presenting for impres-
sions sake his face brightened

  if the world would have one more
look at my humble body before its
peoples are plunged into the whirlpool
you may take your tin-types as my last
gesture of love

  he hoisted himself upright and stood
tense and dignified at the end of the
ark louie judged to be the prow a
couple of cats nosed about his legs and
he picked one of them up louie
scrambled back up the clay bank he
snapped two or three shots of the gulch
and the ark then with his precious
cat-eye he took another of the entire
scene this time twenty-four hours
wouldnt bring any change not even
louies cat eye



the end of the world louie was as-
sured of that as he headed the chevy
toward town

  still that cats-eye lens was too much
to pass over lightly just a chance
that something might happen louie
brock had a healthy respect for broken
mirrors black cats and superstitions
in general the old world was anchored
pretty firmly for a complete washout in
one day he thanked the old duck and
promised to look him up in heaven

jgack at the post he turned the plates
over to the engraver and headed
for the boarding house no good try-
ing to find kitty shed said shed be
gone all day that might mean weeks
with nothing better to do louie headed
for the darkroom and his end of the
world picture without looking at
the drying negative he made a double
deck sandwich in mrs sherrigans
kitchen and sat on the metal table top
to digest it

  the negative dry he went after
it still chewing on the cold bacon and
lettuce back in the kitchen he plopped
it down on the table and started munch-
ing again the sharp outline of the
negative flashed up from the table top
and his jaw dropped louie swallowed
the last mouthful of sandwich and
stared the prophet had been right
tomorrow was the end of the world

  here under his twitching nose was
a picture of a great raging torrent
people were being flung about under
its force small heads drifting above the
mass of dirty water some of them had
reached the very bank hed stood on
this afternoon and were hanging to
the roots and underbrush mouths open
in despair

  feeling very weak in the knees he
dragged himsef into the darkroom
working feverishly he made an eight
by ten print of the thing and tried to

make out more of the details in the dim
light no good the ark was there
he was sure of that and the bewhisk-
ered figure at its prow was familiar
out into the hall he ran the print still
dripping the door was open and he
ran to it letting the sun pour over his
shoulder then louie brock saw some-
thing that ended his own private world
at a glance

  stretched full length on the slippery
river bank was kitty wallace he
tried to convince himself that it was a
dream no she was there her slip-
pers gone hair soaked and clinging
against white shoulders the dress or
what was left of it lingered against
her smooth body accenting every curve
there was a mole too a little brown
spot that branded her clearly the
mole louie thought with a blush was
right where it should be and where no
one but he should ever know

  that wasnt the worst of it a tall
dark fellow bent over kitty arms about
her slim waist held in close embrace
kittys lips were pressed against his
cheek

  the world turned a dirty collection
of terrible pinks and mangy greens
he started to tear the print in his
shaking hands thought better of it
folding it carelessly he started blindly
for rays place minus hat and coat

jouie drank the clock around he
went into an uncomfortable stupor
on the bar at eight in the morning
ray brought him gently to his feet

  better go home laddy he said
kindly youve had enough to sink
the axis

  louie emerged into the sunlight
hiding it from his eyes his hat was
four sizes too small

  wish there wasnt any sun he
muttered who started the idea any-
how


fantastic adventures

  the sidewalk lurched up under him
he dodged it saving himself a treach-
erous blow in the face traffic on state
was all moving backward horns
blasted at his eardrums in a continual
scream trying to undermine his last bit
of morale a man at least ten feet
tall emerged from the post building and
came toward him it was pat mullens
his height shocked louie

  hlo pat ol boy he murmured
my how youve grown

  from your looks pat suggested
id say your head was the biggest part
of you

  louie sighed looking very sad the
minute he closed his eyes a dozen kit-
tys all with big green eyes danced
around him teasing wickedly his
stomach twisted savagely louie was
going to die

  im going on the ark he said
when you and the rest of em are
drowning ill sit with the prophet and
float away from it all

  pat took him firmly by the arm

  youre going home pronto

  louie was deeply hurt pat couldnt
understand him besides pat was a
traitor finding he couldnt fool him
with the tall man disguise pat was
getting short again very short and
spreading out all over the sidewalk
he looked like something under a steam
roller

  louie chuckled

  pat he said you get around
dont you he leaned on a fire hy-
drant to steady himself and it lurched
from under him pat steered him into
the car

  jeebies pat muttered you are
lit

  nope louie was growing insistent
and i aint going home the world
is gonna end kittys two-timing me
and tm gonna get saved 

  there was some grain of sense be-

hind all this pat decided when a
man gets this bad humor him

  okay he agreed where are we
going

  louie told him-with gestures

t ouie brocks magic lens had
scored a direct shot the little
gully beyond stateville was a bedlam
water rising by the minute had filled
its banks to the brim the ark had
swung into midstream with the prophet
and his horde of wild stock on board
it hesitated there about to break loose
from the mud bottom

  people struggled in the water sink-
ing to rise again their heads floating
on the surface some of them had
crawled free of the rising water and
were clinging to debris along the bank

  kitty wallace and her lover were
among them her clothes were nearly
torn from her the soaked green dress
left more in sight than to the imagina-
tion her arms were about the man
with her their lips were pressed
tightly together kitty was putting
everything into that kiss

  help me darling she whispered
im so helpless but now-

  im glad i came he answered
simply without you life wasnt
worth living

  a motor roared above them on the
road then stopped  there was the
slam of a door and kitty sat upright
her companion was deeply concerned
a small projectile of hate plummeted
down the bank slipping and howling
bloody murder he landed smack
against the man at kittys side sending
him into a backward spin toward the
water

  you slimy lousy woman-baiting
son of a spinach eater louie screamed
the spinach eaters offspring sank out
of sight in the mud and water came up
spitting
louies cat eye



    oh mister slinkvitch he shouted
 in a high tenor s-save me

   coming a high voice sang out
  from the bushes behind louie a stout
 figure emerged and knickered legs bore
 it down upon louie with three gal-
 lons of rays beer in him louie let go
 again mr slinkvitch sank out of sight
 beside louies first victim louie
 started up the bank for more of them
 slipped fell flat on his face in the
 mud kitty was by his side helping
 him up tears coursed down her dirt-
 streaked face

    oh louie she wailed mournfully
 look what youve done yohve ruined
 everything

 jphere were more of them now one
 fellow carrying a box on a tripod
 blinded louie ignored kittys cry and
 tore into the fray he had all the gusto
 of a landing marine louie took the
 big boy first and went into the drink
 with him box tripod and all he
 came up shouting

   goodbye kitty always remem-
 ber i loved- there was a horrible
 gurgle as slinkvitch clutched at his
 shoulder and drew him under water
 again

   he swallowed a gallon of water
 mixed with three pounds of wet clay
 something solid clutched his wrist and
 louie felt the bank slide under him
 pat was drawing him to safety he
 stretched out very still and white beside
 kitty for a moment something akin
 to discouragement was in her eyes
 then she smiled tenderly down at him

   youve made an awful mess of
 things cave man

   louie tried to speak but no sound
 came

    leave him there to die  the voice
 shook with rage it was sam wallace
 standing well in the background in a
 spray of mist louie shook his head

and rubbed the water from his eyes
the rest of them were there the guy
who had kissed kitty slinkvitch pat
sam and some others who had murder
in their eyes

  i should kick him slinkvitch
screamed already hes ruined a
camera and a hundred feet of film five
hours lost and all because of this dum-
mox

  listen honey louie groaned i
was tight i saw that guy making love
to you and blotto he sank back
again found her knees cushioned under
his head a cool hand stroked his face

  pat hunched down beside him

  listen sap he said i didnt
know this was where you were headed
for this is the surprise kitty was
saving for you

  louie looked sad

  it was a surprise all right he an-
swered the biggest one ive ever
had

  not that kind kitty reassured
him mr slinkvitch is a movie di-
rector i got permission in hollywood
for a short feature test he was di-
recting the picture she hesitated
smiling oddly that-that jar of cold
cream you saw me making love to is
the lead man

  yeah sam wallace offered she
was doing a good job until you flashed
on the scene

  slinkvitch entered the conversation
abruptly

  its all off my camera ruined that
coffer dam built for nothing extras
paid and all because i want to make
an actress out of this cheap little-

  slinkvitch had said the wrong thing
louie tottered upright trying to break
the hold pat had on his shoulder

  let me go he howled did you
hear-

  youve done enough mullens an-
swered stay put- he pushed


fantastic adventures

louie down again and held him there

  ill sue slinjkvitch shouted its
an attempted murder its sabotage
assault- as he wound up with a dozen
very fitting adjectives

the cameraman leaned over and
picked up a bit of folded paper
that had dropped from louies pocket
his eyes feasted on it for a second
then he ran toward the disappearing
figure of mr slinkvitch beside the
truck they had all come in he stopped
the director went into conference wav-
ing his arms aloft bitterly then he
took the paper and studied it closely
waiting for more action louie saw
slinkvitch turn and retrace his foot-
steps a broad grin was on his face

  thats mine louie shouted recog-
nizing the print give it to me

  it was the print of the flood hed
taken the day before sam wallace
would see it and then thered be tall
explaining to do

  slinkvitch ignored him going straight
to kitty wallace

  you are a natural his thick lips
working with pleasure this-this pic-
ture i dont know where it came from
but its got more on it than a thousand
feet of film

  kitty looked at it and blushed pret-
tily

  who took this shot sam asked
looking over slinkvitchs shoulder

  no one spoke pat looked at louie
oddly you said it was yours

  im saying a lot of screwy things
he wriggled uncomfortably never
saw it before

  such-such a-a-face slinkvitch was
growing very red around the collar
such-

  louie thought of the mole

  such a figure he said why dont

you admit it

  slinkvitch ignored him turning to
his men he said

  pack up whats left im going down
town and write that contract he
turned to kitty young lady you got
a job better yet you got a position
with money-folding money

  the prophet had climbed over his
craft and waded toward them through
the slowly sinking pond

  when are you going to break the
dam and let this water out his eyes
were pleading its awful wet around
here

  he carried a big black cat under
his arm and it scrambled to safety
purring and rubbing on louies leg

  looks like you got a friend pat
told him

  guess hes got a lot of them sam
wallace started after slinkvitch
youre a screwball brock but with
enough rope you seem to hang on the
right end every time

  kitty put her arms around him
are you going to kiss me or would
you rather have that cat

  louie picked it up stroking its fur
gently

  could i have both he asked mild-
ly im-im very fond of cats
youre crazy kitty said and stood
on tiptoe her bare feet buried in the
mud puckering her lips she asked
softly now

  pat studied them quizzically started
to turn away then hesitated

  your love of cats is mighty strong
mr brock he said you must have
developed it in a hurry

  louie looked at him wondering how
much he knew

  you dont know the half of it he
grinned turning his attention to the
pleasant task at hand

  both my husband and i are avid fans of fan-
tastic adventures we never miss an issue

  the story the leopard girl in your octo-
ber issue was just grand we enjoyed it very
much we were wondering if it would be possi-
ble to get a reproduction of the illustration at the
beginning of the story it was so beautiful that
we would like to have a copy for framing

  also we are very fond of lefty feep hes
one of the first things we read

                  mrs helena yocum

                   w margaret way
                  seattle washington

  many readers have asked us for reproductions
suitable for framing this hasnt been possible be-
cause of metal priorities and the need for the
metal used in these plates for the defense effort
however beginning next issue we will offer re-
productions simply as a one month trial for the
first issue to determine whether or not the read-
ers really want them of the illustrations in the
issue reproduced on glossy paper suitable for
framing watch for the announcement next month
as to prices-ed

his debut

sirs

  ive never written to any magazine so i guess
this is my debut fa just entered my files in
january so that makes me a new reader your

mag is among the first three if not first fantasy
mags in the country

  your best author by all means is don wilcox
his last eight stories for fa have all made hits
with me dons now headed straight for the top

  tell paul to keep up the good work with his
back covers it is interesting to note that on the
september back cover paul depicts the god per-
seus together with atlas the world bearer i was
very interested in the snake-haired feminine head
perseus was holding i was at a loss when gade
said nothing about it in his story of atlas then
on the october back cover paul gives us perseus
himself the stories for these covers by h gade
are making your back cover department more than
it really is bravo paul and gade how many
paintings has paul on the firing line

  in the april issue you promised to give us some
finlay pictures where are they

                          greenfield ave
                         pittsburgh pa

  not counting the painting on this months
cover we have three more paintings by paul on
hand artist finlay is present in this issue and
we have a half-dozen excellent illustrations wait-
ing future issues they will appear as soon as
suitable stories are written around them-ed

 guns to the right of us  i

sirs

  after seeing your books listed as fantastic ad-
ventures ive reached the conclusion only a fa-
natic person could even write such trash as is
contained in the books you publish i do not
think you can be such good americans when you
waste paper ink etc which could be used for
the war effort anyone that dares to print such
trash lives unreasonably you should be taken
out and shot   if ever i can get enough back-
ing i am going to see all trashy literature de-
stroyed i am an american soldier i will always
boycott your magazine until you wake up real-
ize how much you are hindering the war effort

october line-up

 sirs

 your october issue of fa is the best issue you
 have put out in a long time the line-up

 	the leopard girl by don wilcox the
 idea of having a real leopard instead of a girl gave
 the story a twist

 	the devils lady by dwight v swain
 at the end it had me wondering until i found out
 they were married

 	mystery of the lost race by e k jarvis

 	corporal webbers last stand by leroy
 yerxa none of yerxas stories that i have read
 have been a flop

 	union in gehenna by nelson s bond
 lets have more stories like that

 	double trouble for oscar by james nor-
 man how about another oscar of mars story
 soon dont forget oscarette

 	mr throops incredible hand by russell
 storm

 	jerk the giant killer by robert bloch
 although in last place it is still a good story i
 dont see how bloch writes so many feep stories
 without making them all seem alike

 as for the fantastic classic empress of mare
 by ross rocklynne i didnt rate it with the
 others though it was excellent

 who did the illustration for empress of
 mars

 julian s krupa now a marine did the illustra-
 tion for empress of mars your observation
 on that particular story leads us to ask again
 for comments from readers in reference to future
 fantastic classics which of those stories of a
 decade or so ago do you want reprinted in this

hit parade

 sirs

   i am not going to waste valuable time pouring
 superlatives on the story i consider to be no 
 for the month of october it is one of those
 things upon which no adjectives can be success-
 fully lavished so i will simply name it first
 story of the month is-the leopard girl by
 don wilcox the authors name is enough rec-
 ommendation rest assured dear editor that this
 tale is going to be placed on the hit parade
 immediately

   second place to the empress of mars
 sorry dear ed its a fine story but wilcox has
 it beat a mile if you really want to reprint a
 classic try the first burroughs yarn you ever ran
 -the scientists revolt july 

   third place to that consistent winner of third
 place robert bloch and his latest lefty feep
 yarn

fourth union in gehenna nice crazy yam

   fifth mr throops incredible hand

   sixth the devils lady that much for the
 above-average yarns now for the less notable
 ones

   seventh mystery of the lost race nicely
 written but it shares your usual cover-jinx
 which so far this year has only been broken by
 two stories doorway to hell and the eagle
 man

   eighth corporal webbers last stand end-
 ing dear editor was much too obscure ah if
 some favorite author were to rewrite that tale
 and make it nationally famous

   ninth last least lowest double trouble for
 oscar

   well thats the way it goes either you go
 over an issue and delete all stinkeroos leaving a
 mere fair-to-middling mag or else you print
 what you feel like wind up with a couple of
 duds-and in the same issue things like wil-
 coxs and rocklynnes classics which deserve
 academy awards

  wheel another mac girl this one being very
much all right even if she isnt quite human
and im not being catty either the story said
the same thing nelson s bond certainly gets
around last night i heard a one-man dramatic
reading of his baseball story the in-chute
on the radio and the fellow who did it unfor-
tunately i didnt catch his name said that nels
had written some of the wackiest stories hed
ever read which is true all right but one of the
neatest novels in a long time was his when
freemen shall stand maybe he didnt mean
to be funny but i giggled every time i read one
of his name contractions of cities pretty well-
known right now

  the golden opportunity of lefty feep was
also a golden opportunity for the lefty feep fans

i like that mug

  and man alive two such wonderful stories of
the same variety in one issue is very much in
the order of an advanced christmas present i
mean magarians illustration of talus fan as
well as the story itself and f magarians pic-
turization of shaylas garden-and that story
tool wow those two artists are super special
and should be no  on your hit parade every
time

  i like that john york cabot hes one fellow
who keeps em turning out right every time
dont ever misplace him

  the picture of death reminded me of do-
rian grey but mcgivern twisted it nicely into
a surprise ending hes good at that

  i got a bang out of clee is that all of his
first name or is it cletus garsons startling

 ished the current issue of fantastic amazing
 stories bit the dust a week ago and now
 heres a heart-rending plea from the very hub
 of the wheel of national defense

   the boys in the lab are running short of
 reading material especially science fiction thus
 far as and fa have been the best innoculant
 against that dreaded malady the graveyard
 shift nods were all prolific readers and the
 lag between issues is terrific in fact the short-
 age is so acute that some of the boys are threat-
 ening to start reading chemistry texts-but only
 as a last resort of course why dont you guys
 get in the groove and speed up production

  i am shocked i am dumbfounded i am
 devastated after reading all those terrific
 stories in your october issue of fantastic ad-
 ventures i take back everything ive ever said
 about your books of course it wasnt all per-
 fect but it was the closest thing to science fiction
 classics that ive seen in a long time

   i take back all the nasty things i said about
 your stories i love you like a bosom compan-
 ion in fact i am going to subscribe to both
 fantastic and amazing at the earliest possible
 date

   here is how i rate the stories in the october
 issue of fantastic

   	the leopard girl wilcox my favorite
 author at his best

   	union in gehenna nelson s bond or-
 chids to mr bond he outdid himself on this
 one better than any of his biggs stories

   	the devils lady dwight v swain its
 got that certain something

   	the empress of mars rocklynne its
 very good but his big man was his master-
 piece

   	corporal webbers last stand jerk the
 giant killer mr throops incredible hand
 all rate about the same a little under the
 average for a good short story

   	mystery of the lost race jarvis a
 new name a new type of story the reason
 i saved this for last is because mr jarvis also
 deserves orchids about twice as many as mr
 bond

sneered down all of them if you get what i mean

   mr throops incredible hand-b a little
 different ending wasnt so hot

   so it goes rap old boy nothing a but
 everything ok now dont bother me while
 i get back to the cover

                    john schomburg jr
                    no address

   everybody seems to have liked that cover and
 wed like to indulge in a quiet laugh at the art
 department which frowned mightily on the
 soft colors in this cover  ha ha i-ed

doubtless

 sirs

   doubtless you will receive so many letters in
 praise of nelson s bonds when freemen shall
 stand that one more or less will not make much
 difference however i cannot resist the urge
 to write in and tell you that it was the second
 best story fa has ever printed first place
 is tie between wilcoxs the eagle man and
 pragnells war of human cats it was so
 good that i wont say a word about it being
 science fiction and having no place in a fantasy
 magazine

   i wonder how many of your readers appre-
 ciate the careful work of robert fuqua both
 his carew tower and the cincinnati skyline were
 extremely well drawn and more important ac-
 curate by the way its nice to see a story laid
 somewhere other than new york lets have
 more of the same

   though the other yams in the november issue
 were not as good as bonds they were excellent
 too second place seems to be a tie between
 talus fan and shaylas garden both of
 which were well-written fantasies

   the interior pix were both good and bad this
 time fuqua and magarian were good and
 the rest were quite definitely bad

   pauls back cover was somewhat better than
 the front cover but mccauley did a good job
 too youre overworking h w give him
 more time and hell produce better work

   wanted-paul on the inside and not just
 occasionally either at least twice an issue
 ditto amazing stories a much larger readers
 page a cover by fuqua trimmed edges virgil
 finlay edgar rice burroughs

                          chad oliver
                           ledgewood
                          cincinnati ohio

   if our readers do not appreciate how accurate
 robert fuqua is we do i and when we want
 an especially good job done one that requires
 a little research we call on good old bob i

   paul is coming on the inside virgil finlay is
 here fuqua will paint many more covers be-
 fore our career ends in the misty future bur-
 roughs will very certainly be back and that very
 soon trimmed edges well now we still
 havent any proof theyd be what most of us
 wait-ed

from scott field barracks

 sirs

   i was always a dose follower of your maga-
 zines in civilian life anil you can imagine what
 a kick it gives a fan to browse through these
 dog-eared copies that pass around our barracks

   your septenjer fa had some excellent stuff-
 but one suggestion give us more cartoons only
 three in that issue the one by miller was
 good a little sa wont hurt heres hoping to
 see as many more cartoons in fa as you give us
 in your new one mammoth detective

                       pvt john mathers
                       scott field illinois

   only one bad thing about your suggestion
 pal we have a heck of a job getting enough
 cartoons on the science and fantasy angle and
 to tell you the truth we always just barely
 manage to scrap together enough to make the
 deadline without going to press minus any at
 all i any cartoonists in the army -ed

best writers

sirs	

   you are now gazing upon the hitherto unpub-
 lished work of one of the many normally silent
 readers we consist of many types races and
 colors mostly red in the face when we read
 the readers page our names are tom
 dick but not harry harrys the jerk whos
 always writing those stupid letters in to you-
 you know those make ya wanna fight mas-
 terpieces

   so i will now proceed to vary a bit from
 the beaten track and divulge a little hot steam
 in your general direction this has been com-
 ing on for the last year or so

   i will rate your authors ahem first of
 course comes burroughs he takes the prize
 for being able to hold your interest through the
 story his pellucidar series was magnificent
 but of course you have to consider the fact
 hes one if not the of the best fiction authors
 of today at least to me he is

   for an average easily taken but not in large
 doses author i would take wilcox your
 standard his works are sometimes a little
 rusty but can be imbibed usually with a
 chaser preferably coca-cola

   cabot is the best run-of-the-mill short story
 writer although he fools us once in a while with
 stories like the tenant on the th floor or
 the fantastic twins he turned in one of
 his most hacky crummy and otherwise disgust-
 ing stories in his latest about a haunted house
 it had no actual plan so the hero got scared
 so what we want to hear about fantastic
 things not a polished up ghost story

obrien costello swain and lawlor are okay

   mcgivern williams and farnsworth are a
 little better than okay okay

apollo-god of hygiene

 by henry gade

        apollo is celebrated in legend as the god who
        drove away disease and filth and evil things

   see back cover

a pollo came of good stock since his father
was none other than zeus himself his
mother was leto who pursued by the jealous
hera found shelter in delos where she bore her
godly son under a palm tree at the foot of mt
cynthus previous to this event delos had been
a barren floating rock but now it was chained
to the bottom of the sea so that it remained to
mark the birthplace of the son of zeus

  while he was yet a youngster apollo performed
the first of the acts that made him famed in
legend he slew the python with his silver bow
apparently this was not a heroic dead since he
was forced to wander for a term of years and
expiate his crime by servitude and purification
perhaps it was because the snake was considered
the symbol of the oracle delphos

  apollo seems to have been a jack of all trades
and has accumulated a series of titles that are
rather staggering in their variation and even in
their contradictions of his basic traits

  etymologically his name signifies one who
drives away disease roschers derivation
names him as a sun god but with little sub-
stantiation homer calls him the god of proph-
ecy but homer probably got a garbled ac-
count of his association with the oracle and the
killfng of the oracles pet pythios which name
apollo acquired in some localities as a result of
his deed another title assumed because of the
python was god of the silver bow

  he has been depicted as the sender of plagues
as the warrior as the god of agriculture as
the destroyer of mice and as the ruler of the
seasons

  at one time he must have been a herdsman
because he is known as the keeper of flocks
and especially as one who keep wolves away from
flocks

  later in life he became known as the rearer
of boys and a sponsor of gymnastics he was
the first victor at the olympic games overcoming
hermes in the foot race and ares in boxing it
is probably this that leads to his warlike aspect

  he is known also as the helper and god of
the war-cry that he was quite a marksman
with the bow is evidenced by his title of shooter
from afar his fighting ability might have been
the reason for his reputation as the destroyer

  when apollo began to capitalize on his knowl-
edge of oracles he went into the business himself
and as a result earned the title of ambiguous

crook to translate literally which indicates that
he wasnt very successful in this racket

  because of his association with the oracle who
was also supposed to have healing powers apollo
became known as the healer and seer and no
doubt earned many a gold piece as a quack doctor
who killed oftener than he cured the title of
averter of evil probably is synonomous with
this title

  apollo liked music and by reason of some
enamoured goings on with the muses became
known as the god of song and music and
leader of the muses he was proud of his
ability to play the lyre and when marsyas
boasted of superior skill at playing the flute
apollo had him flayed alive he was less drastic
with midas causing his ears to grow long because
he had declared himself in favor of pan insofar
as flutists went

  he must have traveled the seas to a great
extent because he became known as the dolphin
god offshoots of his seafaring came in the form
of the titles of embarker and disembarker
probably he served as a longshoreman and as
the islander

  that he did a lot of traveling afoot is obvious
from his title of god of streets and ways this
led also to his adoption as the one who stands
before the house probably in the guise of a pro-
tector or a symbol of protection both from vio-
lence and from disease

  lastly he became known as the originator and
protector of civil order and the founder of
cities and of legislation from this we may infer
that he also put his hand into politics and govern-
ment

  a great many things and animals were made
sacred to him the lyre and the bow the tripod
as the god of prophecy the bay a plant used
in sacrifices  the crown of victory of the olympic
games the palm the wolf the roe the swan the
hawk the raven the crow the snake the mouse
the grasshopper the griffin a mixture of eagle
and lion

  apollo was a favorite with sculptors because
of his great beauty and his physical perfection
that he was also a great favorite with the people
is evidenced by the many festivals celebrated in
his honor

  perhaps the greatest truth that can be said
about this god is that he certainly had been
around
