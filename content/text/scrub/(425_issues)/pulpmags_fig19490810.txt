thons you know where to win all you gotta do
is you should just stay on your feet and keep
moving they look punchy but they cant be
punchy here he looked around having his little
joke no they cant be punchy unless the ref
has been hitting em

one fist was irish

by larry holden

the fighting blood of a thousand irish warriors coursed through the spirited
frame of rugged barney nolan sprung him to the fistic heights then lung
him back onto the canvas    into oblivion  as a ring battler whose
fiery temper outweighed the power of his gnarled fists

barney uas a madman the referee
had to tvretle him back to his
corner

sammy sloan grumbled its
about time you decided to fight
again barney he laid his foun-
tain pen across the top of the papers and
pushed them across the desk

  goldie goldstein stood at the window
looking down into the dark steep tacoma
street you should have fought right
away after that canuck died it wasnt
your fault his brains was floating before
he climbed into the ring with you
barney nolan said shut up about the
canuck he bent over the desk and his
pen scratched on the paper

  he did not want to be reminded of
that fight with the canuck dupre maybe
he hadnt killed him the doctor said
one punch would never have done it a
fighter can take only so many punches in
his career and when hes soaked up his

quota hes finished dupre had gone be-
yond his quota goldie was right dupres
brains had been floating before he stepped
into the ring that night

   barney grimaced and kept his head down
as if reading the agreement to fight sailor
molloy it wasnt the actual death that
bothered him though heaven knows that
was bad enough it was that dupre had
looked so much like vince-tall black-
haired lean-faced-except that dupre had
two eyes and vince had only one and a
black patch where the other had been he
had looked just like vince as he came out of
his corner grinning a little crookedly as
if tickled by some derisive secret what
tormented barney was the gust of rage
that shook him when dupres long ex-

with excitement fifty-three seconds
what a battle three hours later dupre
was dead

sammy and goldie exchanged a quick

perimental left speared his cheek his tem-
per had exploded and he had hurtled into
the canuck ripping with both hands

  he remembered nothing about the brief
fight except that when the red mist had
lifted dupre lay twitching on the canvas
and some hysterical woman at ringside was
shrieking ohgodohgodohgod over and
over again and barneys second was
pounding him on the shoulder and yelling

  

significant glance and sammy said quietly
i suppose youre fighting because you
need something for that raspberry farm of
yours again what is it this time
truck needs a new motor

  sammy shook his head

  i dont get it he complained i dont
get it at all youre maybe the best light-
heavy in the whole state of washington
but you only fight when you need some-




fight stories

thing for the raspberries the last time
it was a roof for the barn three months
before that it was a mower why dont
ya get smart barney let your brother
manage the ranch vince knows as much
about it as you do you could make
enough in the ring in two years to buy all
the raspberries in the world

  barney said shortly the ranch needs
two of us

  but that wasnt all there was to it and
the three of them knew it left to him-
self at the ranch vince wouldnt have
raised a sweat much less raspberries
vince was the older of the nolan boys
but without barney he was no good for
anything half the time he was no good
for anything anyway and doggedly bar-
ney kept things going

  that had started when they were kids
vince was ten barney was eight old
man nolan was a tough irishman and
the two boys had to do their chores every
day or else the or else hung behind
the kitchen door and stung like blazes
when it snapped across your backside
vince had been as little fond of chores
then as he was now and the minute
the two kids were out behind the barn
vince would light into barney and beat
the bejayses out of him until the younger
boy stubbornly fighting back the tears
did the chores for both of them that
was just fine for vince but there was
only one thing he forgot and that was
barneys red-irish temper barney fought
back until he was bloody but vince was
bigger and stronger and it always ended
the same way with barney lying flat on
his face with vince astride his shoulders
grinding his face into the ground

       ow will ya chop that wood now

       will ya fetch up the water now
will ya pitch down the hay

  and vince always gave him a final cuff
across the ear even after barney nod-
ded grinding his teeth

  the end of it came abruptly with vio-
lence and blood that wasnt barneys
vince was supposed to go down to the
river pasture and bring up the nolans
three cows but the minute they were
behind the barn he slapped barney across

the back of the neck and grinned

  get gawn half-pint and no backtalk

  for emphasis he planted the broad of
his foot against the seam of barneys
pants and sent him sprawling to his hands
and knees across the stony ground it was
the indignity of that contemptuous kick
that blew the lid off barneys temper he
grabbed up a handful of stones and flung
them into vinces jeering face for a mo-
ment there was an awful silence then
when the blood spurted vince let out a
shriek that could be heard the entire length
of the puyallup valley clear to the base
of mt rainier in the chilly distance

  vince clapped his hand to his face ran
in howling circles then lit out for the
farmhouse yelling at the top of his lungs
he had reason to yell a sharp stone had
split his right eyeball as if it were a grape
there was never even a prayer that the
sight of that eye could be saved

  old man nolan wasnt fooled for a
minute he knew what had been going on
between them but he had the idea it would
toughen barney to fight his own battles
but with barneys mother it was different
vince was her first born her favorite and
she never let barney forget for as long as
an hour what he had done to his brother
and neither did vince that was vinces
way that was the cross he nailed barney
to

  barneys red hair and fierce blue eyes
gave the clue to the hot temper that burned
inside him but from that day on he kept
the lid clamped so tightly on it that some-
times you could see him shake from the
force of it but he never let go one
glance at his hard leathery face would
tell you that here wasnt a man you could
take liberties with

  and no one except vince had seen the
safety blow off that temper until barneys
fight with the canuck dupre even bar-
ney could not explain that to himself ev-
erything had let go at once that night

  only goldie goldstein would have been
brash enough to mention that fight to bar-
ney but goldie was notorious for step-
ping on peoples toes and he was the
only one in tacoma who didnt know why
barney took care of vince the way he did
he wouldnt have understood it anyway
one fist

his reaction would have been a disgusted
aw nuts that was the way goldie was

  he said cheerfully tell you what
barney i know an honest guy wholl
manage you right let your crummy broth-
er take care of the raspberries   
sammy cried wait a minute wait a
minute and hurriedly flapped his hands
as barney jumped to his feet only a dope
would have talked that way about vince
in front of barney hold it barney he
pleaded then as his quick ear caught the
scurry of footsteps on the stairs he add-
ed warningly theres somebody com-
ing

barney stopped at the corner of the
desk his face tight the door flew open
and little maxie mahler darted into the
room he looked at barney and panted
the henrouilles are after vince
barney whirled where

  maxie gasped the gin mill near the
blue mouse theatre theres four of
them

  he jumped back out of the way as bar-
ney plunged through the doorway and
clattered down the steps sammy sloan
looked bitterly at the empty doorway then
reached out and slowly tore up the papers
barney had just signed he swore monoto-
nously and wearily

  another good fight up the rainpipe
he scowled barney wont be good for
nothing till he gets vince in the clear ive
seen it happen before

  he sighed and let the paper scraps flut-
ter into the wastebasket

barney strode into the gin mill and
the barkeep gave him a frightened
glance the customers were huddled down
at the end of the bar

  barney snapped whered they go
the barkeep shook his head and said
quickly i dunno barney vince lit out
through the back when they come in i
didnt hear no fight outside maybe he got
clear

  barney turned and ran out he ran the
full six blocks to where the model a was
parked he didnt hesitate vince would
head for home he always did when there
was trouble and four henrouilles on the
prod meant plenty of trouble they were

was irish	

french canucks fiery and reckless and
there were a million of them in tacoma
barney wondered angrily which four of
them vince had tangled with or why as
far as that went the model a roared
east out of the city along the ditch-like
puyallup river the moon was bright on
the snowy crest of ranier in the high dis-
tance but barney saw grimly under the
dusty ribbon on unwinding road

  he bounced into the yard behind the
house and cut the lights there was a
snort in the fields behind the raspberries
and a wild clattering crash of underbrush
a bony white shape madly galloping bar-
ney swore one of these nights theyd have
to get together and hunt down that damn
horse it was running wild and starving
ripping down fences some damn fool in-
stead of shooting it had turpentined it and
now it was worse than ever it scared the
pants off the women

  but the horse was forgotten in a mo-
ment as barney ran into the dark farm-
house calling vince vince its me
barney but the rooms were silent he
bit his lip and lighted the lamp in the kit-
chen someday when they had enough mon-
ey ahead theyd have electricity he
glanced toward the corner beside the sink
the guns were still there-the rifle the
shotgun the  hanging from the nail
with its belt and holster that alone told
him vince wasnt in yet vince would
have grabbed for one of those right away
he lit a cigarette and flipped the match
into the coal scuttle then went out and
leaned against the side of the house in the
dark of the porch

  he was there only about five minutes
when ft heard the muffled roar of the
truck and saw the headlights stabbing the
night it swung in at the end of the fence
bounced over the hump and slid to a stop
in a spray of flying gravel four men
spilled from both sides of the cab bar-
ney caught the glint of a gun barrel he
flipped his cigarette over the rail and
pushed himself away from the side of the
house he stood at the head of the steps
his thumbs hooked in his belt

  someone yelled there he is and the
four of them surged across the yard

  that was leon henrouille so it was
fight stories



that gang with him would be pierre art
and maybe paul-the gang that worked
up in the lumber camp the tough ones

  yelling they ran to the foot of the steps
-and stopped they stopped so suddenly
that the two behind tramped on the feet of
the two ahead in the shadows barney had
looked like vince they didnt want any
part of barney they stood scowling as he
stepped to the edge of the porch and looked
down at them

  whats going on he asked evenly
whats that gun for

  leon glowered we want to talk to
vince

  go on home and take your gun with
you

  never mind about the gun we wanna
talk to vince

  the door opened behind barney and
he heard vinces heavy breathing as if
vince had been running alone vince
would never had faced the henrouilles but
with barney there he stepped boldly out
and said in that cocky voice of his

  go ahead and talk to me he laughed

 a growl rose from the four men
grouped at the foot of the steps leon
took a step forward and said

  dont you try to stop us now barney
were taking vince back with us hes
been fooling around my sister long
enough

  your sister vince laughed again i
wouldnt be seen dead with your sister

  barney took one step downyou heard
him he said harshly now get out of
here

  leon said stubbornly everyday my
sister comes out here to pick ra berries
for you she dont get home till mdnight
shes out with vince   

  me and a dozen other guys vince
jeered dont blame nothing on me

  barney said get in the house vince
without turning without taking his eyes
from leons angry face now you guys
get out of here and get fast go ahead
beat it

  leon hunched his shoulders then with a
snarl swung a wild looping right at bar-
neys head barney chopped his chin with
a short left and leaped down the steps as
leon fell back into the arms of his broth-

ers pierre swore and stooped for the gun
barney kicked it into the darkness and
straightened pierre up with a hard right
to the chin he stepped in chopping vi-
ciously with his fists as the other two
swung heavily crowding him back against
the porch

  vince yelled hold em barney hold
em a minute and the front door
slammed vince had gone in after a gun

  barney yelled no vince and ducked
as paul henrouille sprang at him he
brought up his fist and felt the jaw go
loose like a bag of marbles under his
knuckles leon grabbed him around the
waist but barney clubbed himself loose
with raking blows across the side of leons
head he flung leon into pierre and leaped
at art henrouille he caught him full in
the mouth with a straight left and buried
his right in his stomach as the canuck
went back on his heels pierre grabbed at
his legs he kicked himself free and sprang
back up the steps he flipped the blood
from his eyes with the back of his hand
and hooked twice into leons dark lung-
ing face paul had run around to the side
and was climbing the rail of the porch
with the crank of the truck clubbed in
his right hand

  barney scooped up the doormat flung
it into his face and drove a hooking left
to the side of his face paul moaned and
dropped to the ground barney whirled as
pierre dived at him arms outstretched
he knocked him down slapping him on
the back of the neck with the flat of his
hand he took him by the belt and collar
and flung him off the porch he rolled in
the gravel walk and lay still

  art was sitting on the grass with both
hands to his ruined mouth leon was
crawling toward the truck on his hands
and knees and off in the shadows to the
side of the porch paul henrouille was
whimpering softly

  the door opened and vince stood there
with the shotgun cradled in his arms

  beat it he said arrogantly come up
here with me barney

  barney looked at him and reached in
his pocket for his handkerchief he
swabbed the cut over his eye wiped the
blood from his nose and mouth he took
one fist was irish



three stiff steps off the porch stooped for
the henrouilles gun and flung it across
the road into the underbrush

  as he mounted the steps again he said
bitterly to vince dont you know better
than to fool around with our own pickers
go inside and put that gun away

  a half hour later they heard the hen-
rouilles truck cough to life and clatter
back down the road toward tacoma

ii

barney was at the side of the barn
nailing together some raspberry crates
the next morning when sammy sloans
packard swept into the yard vince was
down at the berry shed making sure the
pickers hadnt lined their boxes with twigs
or leaves

  barney was proud of his berries they
were the biggest in the puyallup valley
and he got top rates for them at the can-
nery packers they were packed in little
boxes for the luxury and hotel trade the
smaller berries were called canners and
went into jams or jellies

  sammy climbed out of the car as bar-
ney straightened up and wheezed across
the yard shooing off a belligerent gander

  i dont know why im doing this for
you barney he complained dont ask
you never do nothing for me but come
down to the arena whenever you need a
little dough to fix the farm he waved his
hand at the blond-faced swede who had
followed him from the car this is lars
yvidlund hell take care of the farm
while youre gone

  barneys eyes narrowed and he scratched
the side of his jaw with the claw of the
hammer while im gone he said
gone where

  away said sammy succintly away
on account of youre in trouble just what
the hell he demanded did you hit them
henrouilles with last night two of
thems in the hospital and the other two
dont care if they never get out of bed
theres a warrant out for you

  barney said so what they came here
looking for trouble and they got it
sammy wagged his head theres no
so what about it barney please believe

me im your friend look im here-
im talking to you like a father you
have to go away for awhile barney till
it blows over

  thanks for coming out sammy
but  

  now its buts i get sammy sighed
look in tacoma there are more hen-
rouilles than smiths thats votes thats
influence they want to put you in jail
is it reasonable that one man cant beat
four men without using an ax ask me

  barney picked up his half-finished crate
and stood it on the saw-horse he took
two nails from his pocket theyre bluff-
ing he said theyd be laughed out of
tacoma

  if they took it to court sammy
agreed but maybe they wont take it to
court you see maybe they just put you
in jail while they get vince they dont
want you barney they want vince
theyre pretty sore with vince right now
sore enough to kill him maybe dont
be mad with me barney but vince is not
a nice boy he was not nice to that
pretty little henrouille girl if they get
vince there will be trouble for everybody
vince will be hurt when you come out
of jail you will say can i let them
henrouilles get away with that you
have a bad temper barney you would
be in worse trouble and the henrouilles
would be in trouble i like the henrouilles
i like little jeanne henrouille it would
be much better all around if you took
vince and went away for awhile lars
here is a good man he will grow good
raspberries for you while you are gone
wont you lars

  lars said stolidlyi am goot farmer
you bet

  barney clutched the hammer until his
knuckles showed yellow-white across the
back of his hand sammy saw the red
temper raging behind his eyes but barney
fought it down as he always did when
there was something concerning vince he
threw down the hammer and nodded

  all right he said between clenched
teeth he took a breath and held it the
flaming words died sputtering in his throat
only his glance toward the berry shed
where vince was joking with the pickers


fight stories

showed that the ancient guilt still burned
inside like radium

  sammy threw his plump arm across
barneys big shoulders and urged him to-
ward the house saying eagerly you go
to aberdeen where a friend of mine has
a shingle mill you take your truck people
will think you go to yakima for the
apple picking or maybe even to seattle for
the boats my friend will give you jobs
the mill is working twenty-four hours a
day they need men you have an en-
gineers license you will be paid well
that part you leave to sammy i call
him on the telephone you will not lose a
penny you will see no one will think
you go to aberdeen you leave every-
thing to sammy barney

  barney roared vince and ran into
the house unbutoning his shirt as he ran
there was no mistaking the urgency in
his voice and vince came bounding across
the yard at sammys order widlund
plodded stolidly toward the berry shed
where the pickers were waiting to have
their crates tallied

  fifteen minutes later sammy stood in
the middle of the road and waved as the
truck swirled away in rolling clouds of
dust he took out his handkerchief and
mopped his face muttering a klulas that
belied the sloan part of his name sammy
could swear in eloquent jewish

the mountain rose at the head of the
aberdeen street like a tree-clad wall
the fresh odor of cut lumber was like per-
fume in the air to the north the cone-
shaped furnace with the spark-trap at
its top burned the everlasting sawdust
with fragrant smoke a freighter from
newark new jersey was loading lumber
at the dock at the opposite end of the
street from the mountain

  three ordinary seamen all so young
that they had not yet tasted the first edge
of their first razor scrambled out to the
street and hailed the truck their thumbs
out-thrust in the ever-hopeful sign of
hitch-hikers

  barney said mildly were coming
kids not going their faces fell and he
said shrewdly whatd you do jump
ship

  they grinned and looked embarrassed
and the tallest said we want to see the
country before we go back to newark
he said it a little defiantly as if expecting
the usual adult rebuke we heard there
were jobs in the lumber camps around
tacoma

  barney grinned they stood as much
chance of getting a job in a lumber camp
as they did of growing a beard overnight
less

  tell you what he said they need
pickers up in the puyallup valley you
go to the nolan ranch and tell lars
widlund i said to put you on im barney
nolan youll see a lot of country up
there every morning youll look out the
window of the bunkhouse and therell be
mt rainier thatll be something to tell
your folks when you get home get a
hitch to tacoma anybodyll direct you
from there

  the kids grinned their thanks vince
didnt say anything until barney started
the truck again

that was a dumb trick he growled
take it easy vince we were on the
road and broke ourselves when we were
their age remember and we sure ap-
preciated a hand out

  sure sure but now everybody in ta-
coma will know the nolans went to aber-
deen that was using your head all right
barneys mouth tightened that was
vince all over-but hewas right sooner
or later the kids would blab that theyd
seen barney nolan in aberdeen and even
in aberdeen they had law and order-law
and order that would snatch vince back
to tacoma and the vengeful henrouilles
where you going now demanded
vince sullenly as barney passed the turn-
off to the shingle mill

  barneys temper rose to get you out
of your mess thats where he snapped

  vince laughed bitterly out of my
mess he said maybe im the one
who beat up the henrouilles maybe im
the one who put them in the hospital im
the one theyre after is that it if youd
left it to me theyd of run like ants when
i came out with the shotgun but not
you hell no youre not happy unless
youve got your fist in somebodys puss
oise fist was irish



thats you you had to beat them up
first i dont know why i stick with you
anyway a thin edge of a whine crept
into his voice and his fingers lightly
touched the black patch over the empty
socket of his right eye if it hadnt been
for this i could of got a good job in the
city and the hell with the ranch they
take one look at me and   

  barney said desperately all right
vince

  sure all right for you you got two
eyes but look at me who wants a
guy with a black patch in the middle of
his face i cant even get a job in a gas
station

  barney said again all right vince
vince knew when to shut up he had
made his point and he was satisfied he
had reminded barney whose fault it was
he could see barney writhing under the
sense of guilt he leaned back against the
seat he was satisfied he lit a cigarette

  he stayed in the truck when barney
stopped it at the end of the dock and
walked toward the freighter

but when barney was out of sight
over the end of the gangplank amid-
ships he jumped lightly out of the truck
and walked back up the street that lop-
sided grin of his dug secretively into his
cheek and his eyes danced he was away
from that lousy raspberry ranch at last
and he was going to stay away he was
tired of barney trying to make a hard-
working citizen out of him barney wasnt
smart-that was the trouble with barney
he could make a million in the ring a
million-and the dumb thing about the
whole business was what barney actually
wanted to do well-his grin spread-
hed take care of that too

  he called sammy sloan from the drug
store

  those canucks dead yet sammy he
asked cheerfully this is vince nolan
sammys voice went as cold as january
ice tell barney they aint as bad off
like they thought at first he said why
dont you come back and marry the girl
you lousy schmoe you

 vince laughed you marry her
sammy shes okay take my word

  your word said sammy heavily i
take like i take arsenic he hung up with
a jarring clatter

  whistling vince mounted a stool at the
counter beside a fat man with a red
dyspeptic face and ordered a cup of coffee
and a jelly doughnut

  where can i buy two pair of boxing
gloves around here joe he asked the
counterman

  the fat mans head jerked up and he
grabbed vinces arm before the counter-
man could answer me he said eagerly
me i got boxing gloves good calks i
got too you go to the lumber camp no
vince saw barney coming into the
lunchroom and he shook his head violently
and waved him away barney looked
puzzled but went outside and lit a cigarette
vince turned to the fat man

  just boxing gloves uncle he said
easily if theyre any good ill give you
ten bucks for the set

  the fat man hopped off his stool i
come right back he said he went
through the side entrance

  whos he vince asked the counter-
man

  him hes got a second-hand shop
next door sell you anything you could
of had them gloves for a fin hes had
em two years

  vince winked what makes you think
he was going to get more than that any-
way 

  when he rejoined barney outside he
had a thick paper-wrapped package under
his arm he gave a quick backward
glance at the door of the lunchroom and
hustled barney down the street

  that was the police chief that fat guy
he whispered and you almost walked in
on him theyre looking for us but he
was too dumb to realize he had me they
think leon henrouilles gonna poop out
did you get us berths on that freighter
barneys shoulders slumped yeah
he said dully were shipping as ordinary
seamen to replace those kids that jumped
ship he clenched his fists im going
back to tacoma vince im not running
away  

  vince took his arm and dropped his
voice persuasively thats just what i


fight stories

told sammy sloan i called him on the
phone right away barneyll be back to
face the rap i said you should have
heard him the air was thick with mat-
zoths

  im going back vince

  sure sure you are barney but
not right now right now theyd
crucify you sammy said tell barney to
wait till after the election the henrouilles
are on the wrong side of the fence this
time with the henrouilles out youll
get a fair shake in court and anyway
leon aint dead yet theyre gonna do
an operation on him if he pulls through
youre in the clear see sammy says hell
write to you general delivery in newark
now lets get aboard and stay there till
we sail

  barney said hopefully sammy said
that

  dont worry barney sammyll keep
things under control just wait till you
hear from him thats all he patted
barneys shoulder and his grin ran lightly
up his right cheek

  barney got the - watch with the
third mate vince was with the second
mate on the - and the third ordinary
seaman a kid of seventeen hired at dock-
side was given the -

  the decks were piled high with stacked
and lashed lumber but vince got per-
mission from the chief mate to rig a
small ring on the poop deck there was
hardly room to spar but when the weather
became warmer and the seas smoother as
they sailed southward barney and vince
put on the gloves everyday vince was
hard to spar with because of his dead eye
for barney had always to work to his
left but in no time at all barney found
himself with more sparring partners than
he knew what to do with there was a
new one every day when the deck work
was done

  despite the situation in tacoma with
the henrouilles barney was at peace with
himself he didnt have to worry about
vince he had always looked after vince
and now there was nothing to worry about
nothing could happen until they got to
newark

  at first the third mate had been very

friendly but his manner toward barney
had cooled rapidly until at last they
scarcely exchanged a word through the
dark hours as barney stood at the wheel
staring fixedly at the yellow light of the
compass in the binnacle while the mate
paced the bridge from port to starboard
watching for lights ahead the mate spoke
only on the half hour when barney had
to reach up and sound the bells there
was a break at four bells and barney was
given ten minutes off to go down to the
galley for a cup of coffee that tasted as
if it had been brewed from dried liver
and in the beginning the mate had always
said in a friendly voice

  time for the smorgesbord nolan ill
take over the mates name was an-
dresson

  but now he merely grunted and shoul-
dered barney away from the wheel after
he had struck the four bells his hostility
was unmistakable but barney was feeling
too good to think much about it he en-
joyed the long silent hours on the bridge
lifting his eyes occasionally to watch the
long blue pacific ground swell or to watch
the play of dolphin at the bow or the
swift cutting fin of a following shark
waiting for spilled garbage or just to
stand there and look up at the velvet
bowl of jewelled sky and feel the life of
the freighter under his feet as the heart of
the engines beat against the soles of his
feet in fact he did not even realize that
the mates attitude toward him was
charged with the electricity of hostility

  the blowoff between them came the
night before they anchored on the pacific
side of the panama canal the old tub
was ploughing peaceably along through the
long swells listing just a little to starboard
-not enough to count-and the air was
as smooth and caressing as a blondes arm
around your neck

until darkness fell-the sun went
down like a fried egg in the skillet
of the sea-the mate paced the bridge with
angry staccato steps he was young no
more than twenty-five if that and he had
a stern scandanavian sense of right and
wrong he felt very strongly about every-
thing
oise fist was irish



  he stopped stiff-legged outside the egg-
yolk light of the binnacle and thrust his
square hands deep into his pockets and
said harshly

  see here nolan i want to ask you
something youre a professional aint
you 

  his voice had a cutting edge and it
knifed through barneys reverie barney
looked up with a start

  whats that he said im sorry i
didnt hear you swede

  in the beginning in friendly comraderie
he had called the mate swede and the
mate had called him shanty irish

  the mate barked you say sir when
you talk to me

  barney grinned the hell i do this
isnt the navy he still thought the
mate was joking

  the mate asked nastily do you want
to be logged for insubordination you
call me mr andresson not swede
barney blinked but still grinned yes
sir he said with amused emphasis
answer my question

  im sorry sirrrrr but i didnt hear
your question

  are you a professional thats what
i want to know

  a professional what

  fighter nolan fighter you know
what im talking about

  barney didnt know what he was talking
about he glanced at the compass and
turned the wheel slightly to hold the
course steady

  i fought some in the ring he said
but im not what youd call a profes-
sional

  i thought so the mate said with satis-
faction thats just what i thought
thats the explanation

  barney wras no longer amused the
mates edgy voice had aroused his in-
flamable temper explanation of what
he demanded his hands tightened on the
spokes of the wheel temper that was
what had always gotten him in trouble
temper his fingers relaxed

 pm sorry swede he said more
quietly whats bothering you
andressons square hard face moved
into the feeble light of the binnacle can

you lick me he demanded i been in the
ring too or maybe you wont take a
chance on somebody that aint a push-
over

 the swede weighed a hundred and
ninety barney was one-seventy-two he
shrugged good-naturedly as the flood tide
of his temper receded

  probably not he said amiably you
got weight and reach and that i fought
in a ring dont mean nothing

  scared

  no im not scared his temper bub-
bled again whats on your mind any-
way a hot spot deep inside deep where
he lived began to glow he felt the
heat of it rising behind his eyes dam-
mit he said hotly stop hinting around
and get it off your chest

  the mate stood squarely before the bin-
nacle so barney could see him andressons
young face was as hard as saddle leather

  you and your brother he said harshly
have been taking the crew over long
enough you hear me long enough ive
been watching you back there on the poop
deck every night sixteen ounce gloves
pillows they might just as well expect
to knock you down with a feather duster
so

  you and your brother have been clean-
ing up ten bucks to get in the ring
with you they have to pay fifty bucks
theyd get if they can knock you down
not out-just down sounds easy but its
a laugh aint it nolan a big laugh
that bunch of clowns couldnt knock a
good professional down if they hit him
with capstan spokes you and your
brother havent left a dime in the deck
crew or the whole damn black gang

  the chill that prickled down barneys
back told him that the mate was telling
the truth-that vince had been to work
on the crew that all those willing sparring
partners had just been suckers-suckers
at ten bucks a throw you could trust
vince to have an eye out for the easy
buck knock him down those free-
swinging comedians couldnt have knocked
down a wooden indian

  but there was still that soft rotting
spot in barney-no matter what vince
did it was barneys fault vince wouldnt
	fight

have been like that if hed had two eyes
like everybody else if he didnt have that
damning black patch over his right eye
socket if he could but have faced the
world squarely instead of having to turn
his port side to it continually a thing
like that could gnaw at a mans soul as
it had gnawed at vinces who had a
deformity through no fault of his own
who had a deformity because of his
brother his brother his own brother-
barney

  barney said dully realizing that he was
merely defending vince nobody made
them box with me they took their
chances the odds should have told them
that there was damn little chance of their
winning we didnt pick their pockets

  the mate said sarcastically the hell
you say then grimly i talked to the
captain about it he wanted to stop those
little boxing bouts on the poop deck but
i talked him out of it i talked him into
letting me put on the gloves with you
tomorrow night just a friendly exhibition
nolan he thought it would be good for
morale for the crew to see you flat on
your back for a change what do you
say nolan-or do you have to ask your
shyster brother first

  barney said dont worry about me
ill be there

  andresson nodded and without another
word walked to the end of the bridge
at seven bells barney went aft to the
focsle to ready vince for his watch three
seamen were playing rummy on one of
the lower bunks but barney noticed that
there wasnt any money up they watched
him silently as he reached up and shook
vinces shoulder vince sat up imme-
diately he hadnt been sleeping he had
been lying there pretending because the
crew was giving him the same silent
treatment they had given barney he
turned at the door thumbed his nose at
the three penniless card players and fol-
lowed barney out to the deck

  crummy bunch he grumbled ill be
glad when we get to newark

  me too barney said nothing about
the way vince had taken over the crew
or about the scrap he was going to have
with the third mate the following night

stories

  he left vince in the galley with a cu
of steaming coffee and when he climbed
back to the bridge the second mate was
already there in earnest conversation with
the third as barney took the wheel the
second mate said abruptly

  its off there isnt going to be any
bout

  the third mate growled the hell it
is

  the second mate swung around what
do you want to do-lose your ticket he
demanded fiercely the old manll break
you if he finds you getting beat up by a
focsle bum

  i wont get beat up

  thats a chance youre taking this
monkeys a professional pug and the only
place you ever fought was the ymca
look bud he turned back to barney
be a good guy just dont show up with
gloves on the poop deck tomorrow night
he he jerked his thumb at the glowering
third mate didnt say a word to the
captain about this the old mand never
let him go through with it dont fight
him

  youd better be there nolan andre-
sson said angrily over the seconds shoul-
der or ill turn your brother in to the
captain for gambling and hell see that he
gets thirty days or more in clink when we
dock thats one thing the old man wont
stand for and you stay out of this
he said to the second

  the second snapped okay okay
turned his back and stamped to the end
of the bridge

ill

they were too late to go through the
panama canal the next day and
they dropped anchor just outside on the
pacific end barney and vince went up
to the poop deck as usual after chow
the crew lounged around the tiny im-
provised ring and jeered there was a
savage gloating not in their voices as
vince put on the gloves with barney

  it wont be long now nolan

  tonight you get yours

  see how long youll stand up when you
get a few smart gloves in your kisser
one fist was irish



  barney clinched with vince and whis-
pered do they know im scrapping with
the third mate tonight

  vince grinned its all over the ship
look down there

  down on the afterdeck leaning comfort-
ably against the stacked lumber was the
chief mate the chief engineer and his
two assistants and perched on top of the
lumber was sparks the young radio opera-
tor the only officer not there was the
captain by rights the chief mate
shouldn t have been there either but he
was a little irishman who dearly loved a
scrap and he was not missing this one
even at the risk of a reprimand from the
captain

  ten minutes later andresson climbed
up to the pop deck with the second mate
he nodded shortly at barney and barked
at vince take off those gloves he
peeled off his shirt and gave it to the
second mate he wore only a pair of
thick-soled sneakers and pants he had
long heavy arms and a deep muscle-padded
chest

  barney eyed him as andresson held
out his hands to the second mate who
laced on the gloves- andresson had twenty
on him and maybe an inch or two in
reach but he looked slow-though speed
wasnt going to mean so much in that
little pint-sized ring not much chance
for foot work there

  the bosun a chubby stolid dutchman
was timekeeper there wasnt room for a
referee in the ring

  vince had been shrewdly sizing up the
third mate and just before the bosun
struck the steel bar that was to serve
as a bell he whispered gleefully to barney

  you got nothing to worry about kid
hes muscle-bound look at the way he
moves his arms its a pushover take
him fast our whole bankrolls riding on
this one

  barneys mouth tightened so thats
how the news got all over the ship-vince
the second mate must have shot off his
mouth some more after barney left the
bridge-but vince had spread the word
unless the captain was deaf dumb and
blind he must have heard it too

  the bosun struck the steel bar with a

chipping hammer and cried go bar-
ney moved easily from his corner he had
to take only two steps to meet andressons
lumbering rush he parried a swinging
right and stabbed a light left into the
mates earnest face andresson missed
with a short clubbing left hammered a
right home to barneys ribs and used his
weight to bull him across the ring to
the ropes barney stayed inside and close
and pumped rights and lefts into that
heavy midriff the mate cuffed him across
the top of the head but barney had his
face against his chest and andresson did
not know how to pry him loose

  barney brought up another short right
and the mate grunted barney pushed him
away and danced out into the middle of
the ring keeping his flickering left in that
grim scandanavian face andresson
plodded after him they traded long-range
swings there was a snap and speed in
barneys that the mate would never get
and he was beating andresson to every
punch-and still the mate kept plodding
in and plodding in

  barney felt a stab of pity as he lanced
out that straight left again and rocked
the bulky mate just enough to keep him
off-balance this wasnt just a boxing
bout to andresson it was something much
more important it was another skirmish
in the everlasting struggle between right
and wrong andresson in his bleak craggy
scandanavian soul firmly believed that he
personified right and that the flame-
haired cold-eyed barney was the epitome
of wrong right must triumph

that was the way andresson thought
that was what kept him plodding
straight into that light barrage of long
rights and lefts all he wanted to do was
get close enough to send in a smashing
right that would end the battle-but he
couldnt get set he just couldnt seem
to get his feet in position so he could
get the full weight of righteous wrath
behind his heavy right arm he blamed it
on lack of training he blamed it on the
failing light he blamed it on the uneven-
ness of the iron-plated deck-he blamed
it on everything but the flickering skill in
barneys gloves he took a right to the
	fight stories

jaw and a left jab on his nose but kept
going forward

  if barney had put any real sting in
that left his nose would have been smeared
from cheekbone to cheekbone but andre-
sson did not know this he felt only con-
tempt for the lightness of the blow and
kept his wide right cocked but when his
chance came it was so unexpected that
he was caught flat-footed

  barney jabbed with his left jabbed and
jabbed again and circled to the right and
as he went around his foot slipped on a
smear of crude oil he floundered and
grabbed at andresson for support the
mate stood open-mouthed then with a
grunt slammed in that waiting right it
caught barney high on the cheekbone his
leg slid completely from under him and he
went down on the flat of his pants with an
almost visible thud

  the crew screamed with delight and
even the phlegmatic dutch bosun became
excited and began to count almost as fast
as he could sputter the numbers

  vun two tree faw fife zix zeben 

  vince was on his feet snarling take
it easy take it easy give him time

  the crew booed

 up on the boat deck the captain
frowned how did they expect him to
ignore the fight when they howled like
that but he gripped the rail and watched
tensely as barney gathered his legs under
him and leaped to his feet as the bosun
sputtered    nine und   the crew
settled back with a disappointed sigh as
barney his temper high lashed into the
bulky mate and drove him back to the
ropes with all the sting he could put into
his pumping gloves andresson pawed at
him but furiously he swept the clumsy
defense aside and drove a right and left
to that square heavy jaw andressons
legs began to cave at the knees

  with a start the bosun realized he was
supposed to be keeping time and he beat
on the steel bar with his hammer yelled
gutterally hey hey dots the end of
the roundt hey stop idt

  as barney sat down on the crate vince
pushed under the ropes vince com-
plained what kind of round was that-
ten minutes long then just when you  

  barney said shut up

  vince shut up

  the wait between rounds was almost
five minutes long when the bosun ham-
mered his steel bar andresson got up
heavily and lumbered toward barney his
hands held a little higher protecting his
head he had been getting advice between
rounds he looked cautious and slower
than ever barney stung him with three
lightning left jabs and moved in close
barneys face was white and his mouth
drawn down at the ends he was leaving
openings for the swede-but nothing hap-
pened he didnt want to drop his hands
and have his head torn off there was
power in that awkward right of andre-
ssons

  the mate shot in a left that caught him
on the ribs it jarred him a pale smile
flickered for an instant across his lips he
jabbed for andressons face and the mate
shot in that left again barney gasped and
dropped his guard the mate swung that
looping right barney rolled with the punch
taking the weight off it but he went to his
knees hoping desperately he was making it
look like an honest knockdown andresson
would not be satisfied with less

  the poop deck was a pandemonium
every member of the crew was on his
feet and even the chief mate had jumped
to the stack of lumber to see better grab-
bing the pipe from between his clenched
teeth before he bit through the stem
andresson smiled sternly as barney rolled
to his side

  the bosun yelled   nine und ten
youre oudt youre oudt

  vince bent over barney okay wise
guy so you took a dive so were broke
nuts to you he jumped up and walked
away without seeing if barney needed any
help without lifting him to his feet with-
out even taking off his gloves but barney
had seen the hatred in his face

  up on the boat deck the captains
hands relaxed on the rail he flicked the
perspiration from his upper lip well
thank god that was over it was all right
now that third mate was all right he
was a good boy it would have been a
shame to break him-but a mate whos
been licked by a deck hand isnt a mate
oise fist was irish



a mate has to enforce discipline if nolan
had beaten him that story would have
followed andresson around the whole mer-
chant marine from one job to another
driving from bad berths to worse the
captain shook his shoulders and strode
hurriedly for his cabin before anyone
caught sight of him there praise be that
andresson had won he liked andresson

barney and vince landed in newark
with only five dollars between them
for vince had bet even their pay on that
fight with the mate subtlely vinces
attitude toward barney had changed he
was friendly but faintly patronizing as
one scoundrel might be toward a worse
scoundrel he had figured it all out bar-
ney had thrown the fight that was one
thing you couldnt fool vince on he
knew prize fighting and he knew a tank
job when he saw one he had seen barney
go down from a punch that shouldnt even
have shaken his hair barney had thrown
the fight that was obvious and what
was equally obvious to vince was that the
mate had slipped barney a couple hundred
or so to lay down and vince didnt
blame barney a bit he would have done
the same it was good business but he
was sore that barney didnt share the
two hundred or whatever it was well-
he kept his grin up there-that was okay
that was chicken feed in fact it was
money in the bank he had barneys
number now and that was going to pay
off and in bigger numbers than a measly
two hundred too

  they took the bus from port newark
to penn station

  i think wed better wire sammy sloan
to have lars widlund send us some dough
to tide us over till i find a job barney
said we cant go far on five bucks

  sure said vince sarcastically thatd
be smart why not go out there and ask
widlund yourself-then the cops wouldnt
have to come across country to grab you
suppose leon henrouilles dead the
tacoma copsll be watching sammys mail
like hawks and widlunds too the hell
with that well go to a hotel then ill
go down to the post office and see if

-fight-fall

sammys sent us a letter like he said he
would you dont want to take chances
barney hell he said virtously i wont
let you

  barney believed him because he wanted
to believe-he wanted to believe in vince
and also he knew he could trust sammy
sloan out in tacoma whatever sammys
advice was it would be good

  he gripped vinces arm and said quietly
okay vince

  they registered in a fleabag on market
street not far from the station but the
sheets were clean if the lobby was not
vince left barney there and went straight
to the western union office and sent a
wire to lars widlund asking for five
hundred dollars then he went to the post
office and to his amazement found a letter
there from sammy sloan he had thought-
fully lifted barneys wallet so he had no
trouble claiming it the letter was type-
written 

  dear friend barney

   leon henrouille is okay now and you
  can come home but you will be doing
  everybody a favor if you leave vince in
  newark or even hoboken lars widlund
  is making raspberries for you like crazy

  it is a good crop come back soon i
  have a good fight for you all lined up

                       sammy sloan

  it was signed with sammys round
painstaking but unformed signature

  vince put the letter thoughtfully into
his pocket and walked slowly out of the
post office the hell with that if barney
went back to washington state the whole
grind of working on the raspberry ranch
would begin all over again nuts

  scowling with concentration vince
walked back to market street he stopped
in at grants lunch and bought himself
two hot dogs and a glass of beer as
he finished his beer he kept nodding to
himself and grinning he had it all figured
out now

  at the drug store on the corner of
broad and market he bought a box of
stationery and a ball point pen then sat
down with sammys letter before him and
copying the careful almost childish form
of sammys handwriting wrote
fight stories



  dear friend barney-

   leon henrouiile aint dead yet but he
  is awful bad so ray advise is to stay in
  nwrk till you hear from me get your-
  self some fights and keep in trim you
  can fight under the name barney ryan
  and nobody will be the wiser let vince
  manage you he is a louse but he noes
  the fite game backwards and fourwits
  and will give you good advise beings he
  is your brother and all even if he is a
  louse but keep punching friend barney
  and do like vince says as you will need
  mfonney when you return as lars wid-
  lund dont no beans about razberies i
  am working on an angle to get you free
  from under a murder rap so keep your
  chin covered as ever yrs affectly

                        sammy sloan

 vince regarded his masterpiece with
pride and put it into the envelope from
which he had taken sammys authentic
letter he sealed it so the small tear on
the flap showed hardly at all and put it
in his inside pocket he rubbed his hands
together and let that lopsided grin of his
run deep into his cheek now for the
real object of his journey into the city

 he went to the clerk at the tobacco
counter and asked say bud where do
the fighters and managers hang out in this
burg

iv

barney was asleep when vince clam-
ored into their hotel room boisterous-
ly waving sammys spurious letter over his
head he sat on the edge of barneys
bed

  read it first kid he grinned then
ill tell you the good news whats he
say 

  barney bit his lips as he read rapidly
his eyes fell to what he thought was
sammys signature then read the letter
again he folded it slowly and put it
back into the envelope

 leon henrouilles worse he said
shortly

  dont worry about it kid sammyll
take care of that end

 yeah thats what he says barney
took a breath i hope i sure hope i

 didnt murder him he broke out the
 four of them   

   sure sure vince soothed him all
 we gotta do is wait see in the meantime
 we do just like sammy says

   how do you know what sammy says 
he says sit tight doesnt he said
vince innocently

   barneys suspicion evaporated yeah
 keep my chin covered he said

   vince took the letter from barneys
 hand and pretended to read it he put it
 back in the envelope and tossed it on
 barneys lap

   there you are he exclaimed its
 just a coincidence but i got a fight for
 you

   barneys eyes gleamed a fight
what do you think i was doing all
this time-running out on you hell i
was busy kid and i got a fight for you
the guys waiting downstairs in the lobby
him and his wife hes taking us out for
chow whattya think of that now
barney sprang eagerly from the bed
and standing before the cracked mirror
over the rickety chest of drawers beside
the window hastily slid his tie back into
his collar he swung into his jacket

   vince he grinned id rather fight
 than eat lets get the fight end of it over
 before we eat

   i think the guys hungry let him
 eat and well talk to him while he puts
 it away he smiled slowly like a cat
 with a canary under its paw

   the man waiting in the lobby was short
 and slight he wore a soiled trench coat
 belted at the waist and further pulled it
 out of shape with both hands sunk into
 the pockets he had a thin tired cynical
 face sallow and darkly sagging beneath
 both eyes the most striking thing about
 the woman beside him was the fullness of
 her wide discontented mouth the volup-
 tuous promise in her lazy eyes she was
 small but deep-breasted and her glance
 sharpened with sensuous interest when the
 two tall brothers came from the dusty
 hallway and strode across the lobby to-
 ward them

    he man looked sideways at her and
 said wearily ah for gosh sake lily
 meet them before you start making them
one fist

  she put on a full-lipped smile and said
through it shut up you little rat

  vince came forward with his hand out
stretched and the man took it limply

  this is alec frazer barney vince
said heartily alecs got a fight he wants
to talk over with you while we have dinner
where we going alec you better take
it easy on yourself because were broke

  so you said lets go down the nov-
elty grill for a slice of fish that wont
bust me

  the woman pinched his arm may i
come too darling she said

  uh yeah sure this is my wife
helen these are the nolan boys vince
and barney

  barney is ryan smiled vince thats
his ring name helen barney ryan the
best light-heavy this side of the rockies
and the other side too ill tell you all
about it while these two talk business

  he took helens arm and led her out
of the lobby talking eagerly while barney
and alec followed

  alec didnt say a word during the three
block walk to the novelty grill but his
hard gray eyes darted from helen and
vince in front to barney at his side after
the initial clinical glance his eyes dis-
carded helen and vince and watched
barney-watched the way he walked the
way he held his head swung his arms
from the intentness in his gaze you might
almost have thought him a doctor and
in a way that was true he was watching
for something and what he saw satisfied
him at the corner of mulberry and mar-
ket a cab blared a sudden horn and alecs
eyes stabbed at barney who merely waited
at the curb then crossed when the taxi
had passed alecs thin lips show a brief
tight smile

  they took a rear booth at the novelty
both barney and vince ate avidly ship-
board food corroded the palate and if
you were lucky copper-plated your stom-
ach

  they ate as if they had never seen
a piece of broiled halibut before in their
lives alec stabbed disinterestedly at his
swordfish and helen was watching vince
too closely to enjoy anything that was
set before her

was irish	

  that patch over your eye  she said
suddenly it gives you quite a look vince
piratical strong dashing

  vince touched the patch with his right
hand and looked quickly at barney it
makes me feel like a heel he said shortly
well aint you demanded alec
vince grinned me im just a farm
boy then quickly switching what do
you think of the kid brother alec

  alec said no

 no why not aint he good
enough 

  too good said alec maliciously too
good pal

  all the better

  not for my money punk he swung
his cynical eyes on barney whats your
price for a dive he asked

vince gripped the table edge and turned
white he said hastily wait a minute
nuts alec did not even look at him
whats your price for a dive barney
barney looked from alec to vince
back again a dive he stammered

  yeah a dive a tank job you got a
price aint you your brother here said
you did well what is it

  barney felt suddenly ashamed he
stared straight down into his plate there
isnt any price he mumbled i dont
work that way

  vince said ha ha ha and drew up
his mouth he looked at alec okay
wise guy you handle it you stuck your
big foot in it now get it out

 alec jerked his chin contemptuously at
vince and said to barney this punk
your manager

  barney shook his head vince flushed
howd you like me to manage you
alec asked the boys will tell you im
as crooked as they come you can believe
it or not maybe i am maybe not but
ill tell you this much-abe salinski wants
a boy for a tank job and your brother
here said you were it i dont think so
salinski wants a shot at the champ hes
building a rep hell pay five cs what
do you say barney

  vince slapped the table i thought i
was to handle that end of it he said
angrily

  alec shrugged it makes a difference 


fight stories

  youre damn right it makes a diff-
erence 

  but he says youre not handling him
if youre not his manager how can you
handle it

  without lifting his head barney said
get back to the hotel vince go on beat
it

  vince never disputed when barney used
that tone of voice he laughed uneasily
and stood tipping over his chair he flung
down his napkin on the table

  okay jailbird he jeered at barney
see how far you get without me his
face twisted with the same frustrated
hatred he had shown barney that night
barney had thrown the fight to the mate
andresson

  he started for the door helen frazer
jumped to her feet

  this partys getting too noble for me
her eyes contemptuously raked alecs
brooding face i think you two boy
scouts want to be alone call me up some-
time alec when youre in the money
again

  she turned and walked defiantly toward
vince who was waiting near the door
with an expectant grin

  alec said bitterly theres a boy whos
had woman trouble before

  barney started to rise from his chair
guess  be    

  alec put out his hand and stopped him
nix kid nix youre looking for some
bouts aint you honest fights not like
this salinski deal give me a shot at hand-
ling it for you i wont cross you none
of my own boys ever took a dive for any-
body he was pleading a little i dont
handle bums but if some guy wants a
tramp for a tank job i usually know where
to find one you dont have to sign a
contract with me just give me a chance

  barney looked hard at him and alec
met his eyes squarely barney nodded
okay he said

he was in miehles gym at nine
the next morning alec had a pair
of ring shoes and trunks for him and he
went back to the locker room to change
alec had looked at the worried frown
between his eyes had started to say some-

thing had thought the better of it and
let it drop

  when barney came back from the locker
room alec was talking to a stocky heavy
who was pulling the weights at the side
of the big room

  here he comes now alec said
theres an extra fin in it for you if you
can put him down and keep him there
the heavy looked at barney with re-
newed interest to him barney was just
another tall lean scrapper flaring wide
from the upper chest into powerful shoul-
ders barney moved with a lazy deceptive
stride the heavy wasnt impressed

  you can pay mo now he yawned
them tall skinny ones cant take it in the
middle ill cut him in half he took
one of the two pairs of practice gloves
alec had under his arm and slid his hands
into them with accustomed ease

  barney came up looking around with
curiosity i never trained in a gym be-
fore he said smoky in here

the heavy looked at alec in disgust
alec said woodenly barney this is
clapper wells hes gonna go a few
rounds with you make it good i want
to see what you can do

  barney said sure and grinned at
wells who nodded disinterestedly and
crawled under the ropes into the practice
ring barney followed him after alec
laced up his gloves wells lounged out of
the cjrner where he had been leaning
bored against the ropes

  barney sparred lightly the way he al-
ways did with vince losening up with
those fast little left jabs dancing around
the slow-moving wells to warm up his
legs without blinking clapper took four
lefts to the jaw and side of the face he
languidly raised his guard a little higher
and gave alec a dry pitying glance bar-
ney peppered him with a shower of
featherweight rights and lefts moving
around a little faster now wells waited
until he was sure he wasnt going to run
into anything solid then stepped in taking
a light left to the jaw and hooked a
savage right to barneys ribs he brought
up his left and sank the right again bar-
ney gasped and went back against the
ropes on his heels
oise fist was irish



  wells lunged after him grunting as he
threw in a hard left and a harder right
a mist swam before barneys eyes and he
clutched at wells arms but the heavy
pushed him away took a short step back-
ward and drove a straight right flush to
barneys jaw he hit him twice more
with short hooks as he went down barney
sagged to his hands and knees and swayed
his head hanging wells gave him a short
glance then turned on his heel and walked
across the ring to the corner where alec
frazer was biting at his nails

  ill take it now alec he yawned
what a creampuff he ought to be up
by sunday

  yeah take a look behind you
wells turned his eyes widened in
surprise barney was not only up but
his dancing blue eyes said that he was
ready for a fight wells grinned

  well well he said if the little rubber
ball aint bounced up again i hate to do
it but lets go

  he put up his hands and let barney
come to him he saw the left coming and
he moved his head a little intending to
roll with it then bore in with savage
hands for the midsection it caught him
on the cheekbone there was an explosion
of sparks before his eyes a right flushed
his jaw from the other side and he grabbed
desperately for a clinch something ripped
into his body and he clung tighter he
threw his weight forward and locked to-
gether they staggered across the ring

  wells gasped take it easy bud
theres only a fin in this for me

  a glove crashed against his chin and
he sat down he stayed there until his
head cleared

  alec kept saying impatiently come on
come on i could have counted you out
twice

  wells turned his head and thumbed his
nose hed get up when he was good and
ready his temper began to prickle what
a lousy trick leading him on like that
so hed run into that powerhouse wide
open

  he climbed slowly to his feet and
crouched holding a tight guard barney
came at him weaving lithely wells didnt
throw a punch he carried and ducked

waiting just waiting for a chance to get
in close where he could do the most dam-
age

  barney didnt like it in the middle well
that was just where he was going to
get it barneys left flickered time and
again over his guard and they were
punches that stung but it was the right
that wells kept his eye on he didnt like
the left but he could take it

  barney was grinning he was warmed
up now and his gloves flickered in and
out so effortlessly that there didnt look
to be any real snap in them they seemed
to lick out lightly touch wells head and
snap back into position for the next blow
when the heavy swung barney reached
out and touched this thick biceps just
touched them it seemed and the sting
evaporated from the punch but wells
could tell you what was behind those light
touches so could alec frazer and so
could the tall thin man wearing a rakish
derby who stood behind him

  barney went in with his hands a little
higher and was just what wells had been
waiting for-a clearer shot at that mid-
section he lunged in pumping with both
hands and felt them land

  but almost simultaneously his head
rocked from twin explosions that crashed
at his chin darkness fell with a thunder-
ous rush when he opened his eyes alec
frazer was mopping his face with a wet
towel

  you might of told me he said bitterly
who is he anyway billy conns
brother 

  just a mick from the west i never
saw him fight in my life clapper

  wells looked at barney who was pulling
off his big gloves

  you got quite a wallop kid

  barney grinned sorry i got sore
clapper i didnt expect you to tear into
me right away

  wells said ruefully yeah its tough
i know just how you feel he climbed
to his feet and as he turned to slip under
the ropes alec slipped him a ten

alec threw a shapless robe over bar-
neys shoulders and whispered
theres a guy over here i want you to


fight stories

meet fran willis he runs the fights
over at st mikes arena

  alec introduced them and willis smiled
nice workout ryan then lightly to
alec how much did you have to slip
wells

  alec snorted since when did clapper
play fish for anybody

  htn thats a fact he smiled at
barney again no offense ryan i just
think of all the angles i got a spot for
you tomorrow night in the prelims on my
card if you want it one of the boys is
down with a broken hand and i need a
substitute

  alec laughed bit off the end of his
cigar and spat it on the floor since
when do you expect to get class like bar-
ney in the prelims he jeered

 and who ever heard of ryan not
me

  out west he was the boy who brought
in the customers you just saw what he
can do they loved him

  as far as i know hes just another
gym-wonder what can he do when its
for keeps ill give fifty just to see how
he shapes up

 fifty why pay him at all make
it a hundred

  for a prelim-boy alec talk sense
tell you what ill do-if he shows up to-
morrow night the way he did this morning
and if the crowd likes him ill think
about him for a semi-final

  alec threw up his hands in despair
grumbled but finally said grudgingly
wholl he be fighting

  a moore a harrison boy

that meatball it wont go a round
willis smiled from alec to barney who
grinned back i dont go for one-round
knockouts he said ive seen too many
good boys put away trying it

  willis winked at alec and hes smart
too he said see you tomorrow night
guys he walked away

  when he was out of earshot alec said
gleefully sold him by heck believe it
or not lies one of the toughest onions
in the racket

  how tough is this a moore barney
asked

  alec grimaced hes got two hands

and one of enis a right and so far he
dont seem to care who punches him in
the snoot the kid who was supposed to
have fought him didnt come down with a
broken hand he came down with a
broken nerve i happen to know youll
earn your fifty

  barney nodded nobody looks good
against a palooka i dont like push overs
talking of push overs alec pulled a
newspaper from his pocket take a look
at this and thank your lucky stars he
pointed at a paragraph in a sport column
called inside stuff with jimmy duff

  it said mentioning no names but
theres a light-heavy contender around
town looking for a push over and offering
five hundred providing that he wont have
to push too hard this department is
investigating and if a fish has nibbled
therell be two of them telling the com-
mission how come

  he means that too alec said seri-
ously duffs a tough baby am i glad
we didnt nibble salinski wont dare
fight a set up now duffs the boy who
can put the fear of god in them well
he stuffed the paper back into his pocket
put on your clothes and do a little road
work in the park i dont think youll
need anything more in here today
barney hesitated alec he said
look if youre going to handle me tank
jobs are out from now on all tank jobs
alecs eyes lighted kid all my life i
been looking for a fighter-a clean guy i
wouldnt be ashamed of handling even
if he never got to be champ i think
youre it know what i mean

  okay thats the answer

  thats the answer you wont have
nothing to worry about now his voice
took on a note of authority again now
get dressed and get out there and run a
little you shouldnt of let clapper move
in on you the way you did that first time
were gonna get a little more spring in
those legs now get going

  but as barney turned away he stam-
mered say   uh    did   did your
brother    get back to the hotel all
right last night

  barney stopped vince had not been at
the hotel when he awakened that morn-
one fist was irish



ing and his bed had not been slept in

 but he said yeah sure he was
waiting for me

  alec looked visibly relieved i just
wondered he  he seemed kind of
sore he mumbled get dressed get
dressed waiting for me to dress you
barney grinned and walked toward the
locker room but his grin disappeared the
moment his back was turned poor guy
he thought poor guy he knew what
was behind that question helen frazer
had not been home last night either

v

while barney was taking his
roadwork in branch brook park
alec dropped in to see jimmy duff the
sport writer

  the kids got everything jimmy he
said he can box and he can hit sure
there are a thousand guys with the same
stuff but hes got something else you
should of seen what he did to clapper
wells this morning after the clapper
knocked him down for a good count he
finished the clapper off like it was a per-
sonal grudge he never let up

  duff riffled through the papers on his
desk he had a round pink face and a
little rosebud mouth but his eyes were
gray and intent like those of a hungry
shark

  i hear he was approached to take a
fall for salinski he said bluntly

  this was one of the reasons alec had
visited duff ordinarily he would have
stayed away until barneyd had at least
one fight sure he was approached he
said promptly but he turned it down
he should have reported it to the
commission

  now jimmy alec said reproachfully
you know better than that you know
how these things are done-theres nothing
to put the finger on suppose some hot-
shot youd never seen before and youll
never see again comes up to a fighter and
says out of the side of his mouth-theres
a spot for you on the st mike card next
month i aint saying a certain guyll be
in the same ring with you but if you took
the count in the fifth and when you got

back to your dressing room and there was
an envelope for you wouldnt you be sur-
prised to find five cs in it thats a
typical approach around here what can
you do with it

  duff tapped his teeth with the tip of
his shears whos this barney ryan
fighting tomorrow night he asked

  that tough harrison egg a moore
then grinning maybe you think theres
a fix on that too

  could be duff said casually to
build ryan up i think ill drop in and
look it over i can tell when moores try-
ing or not he put down the shears and
looked alec full in the face i dont
trust you from here to there alec this
wouldnt be the first fix youve been errand
boy for god help you and this ryan
if i as much as smell fish personally
i like you but i dont like your habits i
dont like the way your hands shake when
you see a chance to make a buck go down
and have a beer and think it over i got
my eye on you

  the enthusiasm went dead in alec he
couldnt deny anything duff had said he
could explain he could tell duff about
helen that he loved her that she had
only stuck to him as long as he was in
the chips and in the fight game you were
either lucky or crooked-but duff would
only laugh at him duff was tougher than
the steel in a bank safe

  he stopped at the door and faltered
i suppose you wouldnt tell me who
tipped you off that ryan was approached
for a fix

  duff said derisively dont be silly
alec went slowly down the stairs to
the street he glanced mechanically at
his watch then with dragging steps
walked up to broad street and took the
bus

  he didnt really expect helen would be
in the apartment when he walked in but
the smoldering ache burst into tongues of
pain when he found the rooms actually
empty the way he had left them that
morning then he saw the closet and the
empty bureau drawers hanging out her
clothes were gone even her handkerchiefs
and bathing suit he stared dumbly he
looked for a note but of course there
	fight

wasnt any helen would never have
bothered to leave a note would never
have bothered to ease the pain his mouth
twisted and he strode for the kitchen he
snatched up the bottle on the table but
even while he was drinking the tears were
spilling down his face

vince did not come back to the hotel
that night either in fact he didnt
turn up until barney was getting ready to
leave for st mikes arena barneys eyes
jumped wide when he walked in

  it was a different vince he was wearing
a yellow sport jacket a coffee brown shirt
and brown sharkskin slacks

  look me over he said with a grin
whered you get the money for that
take it easy i didnt hold up any-
body i cleaned up in a crap game he
lied he didnt intend telling barney that
he had sent to widlund for five hundred
dollars from the sale of their raspberries

  barney shook his head aw vince
youre not going to start that again are
you you know what it was like out in
tacoma you were in hock half the time
why dont you  

  it was just for the stake barney
vince interrupted swiftly im off the
dice from now on i got a job this guy
willis over at the st mikes arena needed
a publicity man and i talked myself into
it not bad eh

  on the level

  on the level kid you know me i
can talk myself into anything say bar-
ney   he affected embarrassment
theres   no hard feelings about the
other night is there

  barney looked down at his hands it
was a crummy thing to try vince you
know i wouldnt throw a fight

  sure i dont know what got into me
vince said glibly i guess maybe it looked
like an easy way to make five hundred
and no oned blame you for getting beat
by salinski but just like you say it
was a crummy thing to try im strictly
legit from now on honest barney
okay vince im glad to hear it
vince threw his arm around barneys
shoulder as they walked toward the door
gonna beat this punk tonight kid hes

stories

three-to-one and i got a hundred riding on
you

  why dont you lay off the easy money
vince how do i know if im going to
beat him

  vince laughed this isnt gambling
kid ive seen you fight when you get
sore youll take him apart well he
slapped barney on the arm see you at
the arena

  barney was faintly surprised when
vince turned and walked down the street
leaving him standing there he saw vince
turn the corner and a moment later he
heard the grind of a car starting off in
low gear and then he understood helen
frazer had been waiting there for him
vince was heading for trouble again

  alec was not at the arena when he got
there he went to the general dressing
room and slowly changed into the trunks
and shoes alec had gotten for him fran
willis came in leaned against the door and
watched him

  barney said hello mr willis seen
alec

  willis shook his head heard hes hav-
ing trouble ill give you a boy for your
corner but youll have to slip him a five
going to give us a good fight tonight

  barney grinned then thanks for
giving my brother that job mr willis
vince is smart you wont be sorry

  willis said drily i hope see you later
ryan

  barney stood in the runway the shape-
less old robe thrown over his shoulders
and watched two young inexperienced
middleweights trying to tear each others
heads off they were both bloody and the
crowd was screaming the bell rang and
both staggered to their corners the ref-
eree raised the arm of one and the crowd
laughed but cheered good-naturedly who
cares who wins a brawl like that

 the crowd was silent when barney
jumped lightly into the ring but it burst
into a roar when a moore strutted down
the aisle cocky and tough he was shorter
than barney but heavier through the body

  the referee an ex-heavy gave them
the instructions in a hoarse rumble he
was a tough referee and you had to keep
punching when he was in the ring he
one fist was irish



didnt seem to believe such a thing as a
foul existed

  moore tried to act just as tough lie
had a reputation for being a scrapper
in and out of the ring and he was trying
to live up to it he grabbed barney by
the arms and snarled at the referee

  this guys got a habit of doin this
he jabbed his thumb at barneys eye he
put his own brothers eye out if he tries
that on me ill give him everything from
the boots up

  the referee growled get back to your
corners and quit the clowning he gave
each of them a shove

  barneys face was white his lips were
a thin line and his eyes were blue flames
as that old fury welled up inside him al-
ways to be reminded of what he had done
to vince

  moore bounded across the ring at the
bell coming in low and hard mauling with
both hands he grabbed barney and
butted and wrestled him back to the ropes
working with everything he had he
fouled barney twice before the referee
parted them he always did that and it
usually worked he put the fear of god
into his opponents he even tried to reach
barney over the referees arms as they
were parted knowing he could get away
with it knowing the crowd was eating it
up it was all part of the reputation he
was building he came sweeping in again
and barney nailed him on the bridge of
the nose with that straight left

  moores head flew back and he flailed
backward across the ring barney stalked
him moore crouched blood dripped
from his face he held up his hands but
he seemed unable to move his legs the
terror in his eyes was so wild that a
sudden hush washed back from ringside
into the deeps of the auditorium barney
went in swiftly and moore suddenly find-
ing his legs went skittering down the
ropes fleeing he had never been hit so
hard with a left before

darneys face tight and frozen his
eyes icy and flat he didnt let moore
get three steps before he was on him like
a great cat lie speared him with another
left and the mouthpiece flew from be-

tween moores teeth barney straightened
him up with a lifting right and drove him
into the corner he stood wide-legged and
flat-footed and lashed a savage two-
handed attack swaying from leg to leg
moores head bobbed and his hair danced
as the gloves beat soddenly at his face
but he couldnt fall for barney had him
wedged in the corner and the blazing fury
kept barneys hands beating in a frenzy
of punishment

  a towel went flying through the air
from moores corners and at ringside even
the reporters were on their feet screaming
and a shrieking woman in the second row
was beating at them with her handbag
the burly referee hurled himself at bar-
ney wound his heavy anns around him
and as he dragged him back moore fell
straight forward on his face someone
was yelling forty-two seconds forty-
two seconds as if his life depended on
it

  barney stood dazed in his corner as the
anger ebbed out of him his hands hung
limply at his sides and dully he watched
moore being helped to his feet the
harrison boy was coming around he
looked over his shoulder saw barney
standing there and his eyes spread with
fear

  as the referee raised barneys hand he
growled what dumb yak matched you
two willis should know better

  the crowd was still screaming when
barney walked alone up the aisle and
down the runway to the dressing room
willis was there but no alec

  willis said tightly alecs home sick
take your shower i want to talk to you
when barney came out from the
shower towelling himself he saw a short
fat pink-faced man talking to willis it
was jimmy duff the sports writer they
stopped talking and looked up when bar-
ney walked in

  duff said with peculiar emphasis so
youre alec frazers boy howd he hap-
pen to pick you up

barney grinned one of those things
if youre smart youll get from under
willis protested alecs okay jimmy
give him a chance dont try to tell me
you thought tonights go was fixed
	fight stories

  hell no moore or nobody would take
a lacing like that for any money whens
he fighting again he jerked his head at
barney

  next week in the final willis said
so promptly that both of them laughed
ill see if i can get that kraut-heinie
pfaff

  that sounds more like it duff looked
appraisingly at barney come up to the
news office tomorrow morning as early
as you can i want some pictures he
started toward the door turned and
get loose from alec frazer

  he nodded to vince in the doorway
and crowded past him willis watched
barney dress and said slowly why didnt
you take it easy on moore when you found
out he was a punk

  barneys answer was short he got me
sore

  i could see that but ive seen guys
get sore in the ring before and they usually
got their ears torn off

  vince grinned barney dont get sore
that way he gets like ice

  willis ignored him can you go ten
rounds he asked barney this heine
pfaff is a tough boy nobodys put him
out yet

  barneys gone fifteen rounds vince
said

 where

  out in   in chicago and knocked
the guy out in the fifteenth too

  willis looked sharply at him it was
obvious that he didnt believe vince but
when barney said nothing willis dropped
it

  he said see you next friday and
walked out

  vince took barneys arm and walked
him down the deserted corridor inside
the auditorium they could hear the crowd
yelling

  vince whispered although there was no
need for whispering dont let duff get
your picture in the papers kid you dont
wanna take any chances till sammy sloan
gets that mess with the henrouilles
straightened up out in tacoma youre
going places and you dont want to spoil
it by having the cops on your neck

  barney closed his eyes in the flush

of victory he had forgotten that leon
henrouille was according to vince lying
in a tacoma hospital hovering between
life and death his spirits slumped

  i guess youre right he mumbled
  sure im right

  vince opened the street door see you
tomorrow kid sorry i cant go out and
celebrate with you but i got other things
to do

  things like helen frazer asked bar-
ney slowly you dont have to run
around with her vince there are other
girls

  sure vince sneered pointedly touch-
ing the black patch over his empty eye
socket i can get any dame i want i
suppose

i  i  it isnt as bad   
no no its nothing nothing at all
maybe youd like to go around the rest
of your life with one eye why not its
fun he said viciously

 but why helen alecs nuts about
her    

  if she dont want no part of him why
should i worry stop preaching will you
im getting sick of it if you want to
worry about something take a look at
this he shoved a letter into barneys
hand i wasnt going to give it to you
but you kept asking for it he slammed
the door and left barney standing on the
sidewalk

  barney turned the letter in his hand
it was from sammy sloan in tacoma
vince had extracted the original and in-
serted his own forgery it said

  dear friend barney

  leon henrouille has a fractured skull
  and they operated it is life and death

  if he dies youll have to dome back be-
  fore election stay where you are till
  you hear from me on account of i dont
  want you railroaded to the caboose he
  has a - chance dont write me on
  account they watch my mail

sammy sloan

  barney put the letter in his pocket and
plodded heave down the street toward the
bus stop on the corner
oise fist

vi

the next morning he went to see
alec frazer alec was in bed he
looked terrible there were two empty
bottles lying on their sides next to the bed

  barney sat on the edge of the bed and
said casually i won last night alec

  knew you would alec coughed as
if his throat were dry he didnt show
much interest

  willis wants me to fight heinie pfaff
next week

  alecs eyes stirred

  barney went on they say hes a hard
rock heinie pfaff

  alec muttered yeah too good for
everybody but the top-bracket boys and
they dont want no part of him a lousy
match for you how much you gettin

  willis didnt say

  interest began to gleam in alecs blood-
shot eyes he pushed himself shakily up-
right and leaned against the headboard of
the bed you leave that to me he said
with more life in his voice that louse
willis hell kick in if he wants you
more guys have busted their hands on that
knucklehead and got no place he swung
his feet over the edge of the bed and
felt for his slippers you go down the
gym and work on the big bag he ordered
ill see you later

  barney went out grinning

  they werent exactly hanging from the
rafters of the arena but there was a good
crowd better than the friday before and
they were yelling for blood

  heinie pfaff was everything alec had
said he was he was short and slow but
as thick-bodied as a wrestler and his small
round head looked like a real knuckle-
breaker he liked to get in close and
methodically rip the middle out of you

  barney went out fast and was three
times around the stolid german stabbing
him with that long left before pfaff could
get set to throw a punch he threw a
long right and pfaff blinked as it smacked
against the side of his jaw barney
lanced a left to pfaff nose and a trickle
of blood showed on his upper lip

  the crowd was on its feet instantly
yelling

was irish	

  kill im ryan

  kill the kraut

  pfaff was the local villain who had
stopped many a favorite son they hated
him for doing it so stolidly in such a busi-
ness-like manner with no emotion pfaff
took another to the side of the head then
suddenly lunged inside working both short
powerful arms barneys middle glowed
an angry red

  pfaff grunted contemptuously ja kill
the lousy kraut like you kill dot feller
out west hey nolan

  barney felt himself go cold who told
you that

  come on fight

  the color drained out of barneys face
he took two more stiff jolts to the ribs
before he tied up the german for a mo-
ment his legs felt rubbery pfaff knew
about the canuck and pfaff had called
him nolan not ryan but before the
referee could come to part them he
pushed pfaff away with a surge of his
shoulders and sent in a straight left that
crashed between pfaffs nose and cheek-
bone pfaffs head went back as if on a
hinge and barney hit him again while his
chin was still tilted pfaff dropped lead-
enly to his hands and knees barney stood
over him hands ready until the referee
pushed him away and indicated the neutral
corner

  the crowd counted joyously and in
unison with the referee

  pfaff was up at nine but he was no
longer the stolid heavy fighter he had been
he looked around and he backed away as
barney stalked across the ring at him he
tried to cover his head as barney came
in savagely in a moment he had lost all
his ringcraft and he backed into his own
corner barney nailed him there with an-
other left then weaving from side to side
threw everything he had beating down
pfaffs guard bouncing his round head
from side to side with the fury of his
attack

  pfaff clutched at him but his hands
feebly slid down barneys arms and he
went to his knees clinging to the second
strand of ropes his head bowed

  alec was into the ring and had the
robe around his shoulders before the
	fight

referee had crossed to raise barneys hand
alecs face was pale and his hands were
trembling he rushed barney up the aisle
through the yelling cheering grabbing
crowd

  this time barney had a dressing room
to himself

  willis came in smiling and rubbing his
hands together and with him the plump
cold-eyed duff duff was also smiling
he even nodded in a friendly way at alec

  nice fight ryan he said to barney
how come you didnt come down to the
office i dont have a picture of you
dont you want the publicity

  hell be down tomorrow said alec
quickly his hands were trembling as he
massaged barneys legs

  the door opened and the silence was
suddenly so thick you could almost taste
it stewie leonard abe salinskis man-
ager walked in and took his cigar from
his mouth duff stared at him with hos-
tility and looked quickly at alec whose
face had turned deathly pale

  leonard said in a hearty commercial
voice glad to see you here mr duff
i think we got a story for you if mr
frazer here is as smart as i think he
is he hooked his left thumb in the
armhole of his vest and smiled benevo-
lently i been thinking we could get a
good gate if we matched my boy abe
with ryan here whattya say mr
frazer

  alec opened his mouth but the words
seemed frozen in his throat duffs quick
eyes darted between him and flashy stewie
leonard in the doorway

  but ryans had only two fights here
he purred how do you know hell draw
leonard 

  leonard waved his cigar and chuckled
itll be all over town tomorrow what he
did to heinie pfaff tonight now the
crowdll wanna see what he can do against
a good boy like abe salinski draw
hell draw like flies

  duff shot a sharp slantwise glance at
the frozen alec do you think ryans
ready for salinski he asked significantly

  alec gulped and said s-sure hes ready
aint you barney

  barney said ill fight him but there

stories

was something going on here that he didnt
catch the air crackled with it

  willis broke into a false cackling laugh
hell jimmy he said you saw what he
did to heinie pfaff tonight heinie is an-
other boy you cant fix and you know it
sure i know it duff dug his hands
in his pockets and teetered up on his toes
and heres something else i know a
week ago there was talk of ryan here
being a set-up for abe salinski and
now just by coincidence in walks leonard
here and offers the same match out of
the clear blue how come salinski sud-
denly decided to fight a rugged scrap after
all he shot at leonard

  leonard shook his head these news-
paper boys he said forgivingly all
the time theyre smelling rats i think
they got rats up their nose mr duff
he said his voice sharpening youre a
real tough feller but lets put up or shut
up you lay it on the table or ill slap
you with a libel suit you think this match
between abe and ryan is a fix okay
say so in your paper tomorrow but you
get ready to go to court because thats
where ill be seeing you

  duff looked around at the ring of set
faces then nodded once and walked out
without another word willis licked his
lips he looked at alec

this isnt another fast one is it
he asked harshly because if it is   
its on the level fran i swear would
we be such a dope im sending barney
in to murder the guy

  leonard said ha ha he should live
through the third round in two weeks
fran he said to willis and rest your
mind when ryan goes down itll be a
poke in the jaw not a poke in the pocket
lets go down your office we talk it
up

  willis bit his lip glanced at alec and
quickly followed the big flashy man out
of the dressing room alec closed the
room

  you aint hardly said a word he said
uneasily to barney dont you like the
match 

  barneys eyes gleamed for a moment
alec he said i only live when im
in the ring
one fist was irish



  alec looked lip sharply at the intensity
in his voice then stooped to pick up the
towel he had dropped

  barney went on when fm in there
swinging something happens to me im
   im getting rid of something i
dunno he finished lamely maybe i got
a grudge against the world and thats my
way of getting rid of it all i know is
that id rather fight than eat most of
the time it was the same way out on
the west coast he rambled on for-
getting that he was supposed to keep
that part of his past hidden i could
work just so long on the ranch but it
would keep building up and building up
until i had to go down to tacoma to see
sammy sloan and have him fix me up
with a fight so i could get it out of my
system know what i mean alec

 sure dempsey was the same way
ever see his fight pictures around the
time of carpenter and willard looked
like he was mad at everybody me i
call it the champeens grudge you got

  they turned vince leaned against the
wall beside the door his hands in the
pockets of the yellow sport jacket alecs
face turned yellow he walked across the
room into the sower and slammed the door
a moment later another door slammed
and they knew he was gone out through
the connecting dressing room

 whys he blame me vince com-
plained i didnt ask his wife to leave
him i aint keeping her away it aint
my fault

  when barney spoke it was as if he
hadnt heard these words at all did you
win on the fight tonight vince he asked
tightly

  win vince grinned took a sheaf
of bills from his inside pocket and riffled
them with his thumb i cleaned up you
were on the short end of -

barney was off the table in a swoop-
ing stride he gathered vinces yel-
low jacket in his big fist and shoved him
against the wall holding him there

  you told pfaff i killed leon hen-
rouille 

  vince gaped ceasing to struggle
youre crazy

  he said   

  i dont care what he said i didnt
tell him nothing barney honest i didnt
wait a minute he said eagerly if he
said anything about a killing maybe he
meant that canuck dupre that died after
his bout with you in tacoma but i didnt
tell him barney honest i didnt
youre lying and who told a moore
that i put your eye out

  not me barney i swear i never
opened mby mouth to moore

  youre lying dammit you cleaned up
on both fights you know i go crazy when
somebody throws that in my face you
knew id crucify moore the minute he
opened my mouth to moore
ately 

  vince detected a note of uncertainty in
barneys voice his eye gleamed and he
said arrogantly take your hands off me
who do you think you are anyway
barney tightened his grip fighting the
temper inside him vinee swore and swung
at him barney saw the fist coming he
jerked his head to one side and vinces
knuckles split the skin on his cheekbone
the compressed fury exploded in his head
and he lunged at vince with both hands
vince cried out in terror barneys fist
caught him on the left cheekbone and
shelving cartilage over his eye he crashed
over the chair beside the door and fell
to the floor he rolled on his back and
lay still

  the black patch had come off and the
sightless socket stared emptily and redly
a small trickle of blood curtained his
left eye and ran down his cheek

  barney crouched rigid with horror the
blood moved down vinces cheek like a
searching accusing finger he felt sick
vince he cried in anguish vince
he picked vince up and gently laid
him on the rubbing table frantically he
rushed into the shower for a wet towel
when he came out vince was sitting up
on the table his hand to the cut over
his left eye his fingers came away
greasy with blood and for a moment his
face was half mad with fear-the fear
of total blindness but in the next instant
	fight

his face changed he was seeing-he was
seeing the blood on his fingers he was
seeing barney standing there ashen-
cheeked he hadnt been blinded-but it
wasnt relief that showed in his face it
was rage hatred cruelty with a hoarse
growl he leaped from the table and flung
himself at barney

  he knew that barney wouldnt defend
himself wouldnt strike back he set
himself and threw a hard roundhouse
right that crashed on the side of barneys
face deliberately he swung his left and
cut open the opposite side barney
groaned bowed behind his hands and fell
back a step vince followed him he
hooked his fist heavily into barneys
unprotected stomach then rocked him with
a right and left to the sides of the head
again as barneys hands dropped bar-
ney was just standing there leaning weakly
against the wall another groan was
wrenched from him as vinces cutting
fists smashed into his face first the right
eye then the left vinces knuckles ham-
mered his lips against his teeth and his
whole mouth went numb he was hit
several times after that but he was falling
and he was out when he hit the floor

  vince stood panting for a moment then
straightened up and shrugged his sport
jacket back in place he blew on his
knuckles

  you crumb he said contemptuously

  he picked up his patch from the floor
and swaggered out

vii

barney did not go down to the gym
for a workout the next day on
the second day alec came to him barney
was lying in bed fully dressed his face
turned to the wall he did not stir even
when he heard the door close even when
alec sat on the edge of the bed alec lit
a cigarette

  this is a heluva way to train for salin-
ski he said mildly

  barney did not answer

  alec said sick kid

  still there was no answer alec took
a few more puffs from the cigarette he
himself was gaunt and there were shadows

stories

of corroding tragedy under his eyes his
hand trembled each time he lifted the
cigarette to his mouth

  when he spoke again it was with effort
i heard that scrap between you and your
brother the other night he said jerkily
i was out in the corridor vince wasnt
the one who put a moore up to taunting
you about putting his eye out and he
wasnt the one who tipped off heinie
pfaff he took a breath i was the guy
barney i tipped them off vince told me
about it that night i braced you to take
a fall for salinski vince said he had you
in the palm of his hand thats what
he told me before we met you he said
all he had to do to drive you crazy was
to mention his eye or just bring up the
name of that canuck dupre i had moore
and pfaff tipped off because i hoped youd
rip them apart when they opened their
yaps they thought youd fall apart i
wanted you to be sure to win barney
thats why i did it dont blame he
spoke with difficulty again dont blame
vince for it

  though alec did not realize it this con-
fession only ground salt into barneys
wounds made things worse now barney
realized that he had attacked vince with
no provocation had come close to blinding
him entirely and for what for some-
thing alec had done

  he said in a dead muffled voice get
out of here

  aw come on barney this aint no
way you go a fight with salinski a week
from friday

  im not going to fight him

  sure you are kid you feel bad now
because you bounced vince around a little
but he had it coming to him whats he
ever done for you ruined your life so
far thats what made you feel responsi-
ble for every crooked deal he got himself
into hes got you all mixed up inside
he aint worth it

  get out of here alec im telling you
get out of here

  alec threw down his cigarette and
jumped up okay he said angrily but
youre pulling all of us down with you
you know what duffs gonna say when
he hears the fights off that he scared
one fist was irish	

you out of it that there was something
crooked and hell make a stink even the
commissionll smell i was counting on
this fight for a stake for myself he said
shrilly i want lielen back see i want
her hack if i have the dough shell
come back im not gonna let your lousy
brother take her away from me i want
her back and youre not gonna stop me
you hear youre not gonna stop me
he fairly glittered with the brittle rage
that wasnt entirely sane he swore as he
wrenched open the door he slammed it
and barney could hear the trickle of
plaster dust behind the loose wallpaper
he closed his eyes and turned his battered
face into the pillow a sense of guilt
and doom flooded over him

  alec was back on thursday and with
him was vince jaunty in a green sport
jacket there was a small bruise on his
left cheekbone but his eye sparkled more
brightly than ever barney sat hunched
in the tattered club chair beside the win-
dow

  alec said coldly this    vince wants
to talk to you ill wait outside it was
obvious that even being in the same room
with vince was agony to him

  vince sat on the edge of the bed and
chided aw snap out of it barney by-
gones are bygones i had it coming to
me he laughed im the guy that
should be taking it hard not you

 barney looked up he stammered
vince

  yeah i been kind of a louse aint
i always standing in your way always
making you get me out of one mess
after another doublecrossing you vince
shook his head and looked down at his
his hands he clenched them im sorry
barney he said in a low voice i was
a heel and im sorry he put his hands
over his face but watched barney between
his fingers

  barney jumped up he sat on the bed
beside vince and put his arm around his
shoulder vince grinned behind his hands
it was wonderful that gift of gab was
worth money

  barney faltered vince his hand
tightened on vinces shoulder it said
more than he could articulate

  vince dropped his hands into his lap
and slowly turned his head his mouth
was a crescent of contrition

  i been a louse to you barney he
said lugubriously

  something bubbled up inside barney
and he shook vinces shoulder forget
it he said happily forget it vince
no i wont forget it but im going
to try to make up for it im not gonna
stand in your way again barney

  barney jumped up grinning from ear
to ear

  buttons popped from his shirt as his
eager hands impatiently tugged at them
this calls for a celebration vince ill
buy you the biggest   

  vince gave him a small wistful smile
youre a great guy barney but if
theres any celebrating to do im paying
for it he could scarcely keep the corners
of his mouth still as the laugh struggled
for release this is on me barney you
get shaved and dressed he patted barney
onthe back im gonna show you a real
time well go to the gilt edge for
dinner then to the burlesque and take
it up from there

  when barney went lightly into the bath-
room he opened the hall door

  you can take off your rubber panties
he sneered at alec its all fixed give
me the fifty

  alecs hands shook violently as he took
a fifty dollar bill from his pocket and put
it into vinces outstretched hand

  now beat it said vince he closed
the door

  he was sitting on the bed again when
barney came from the bathroom shaved
and combed

  this week aint done you much good
kid he said watching barney narrowly
maybe youd better call off that bout with
salinski

  nothing could keep me out of that ring
now barney grinned knotting his tie
before the mirror over the chest of
drawers

  vince let out a breath of relief salin-
skis tough he warned hes tougher
than anybody youve fought kid

  barney turned swinging into his coat
like john paul jones said he grinned


fight stories

ive just begun to fight

  a week aint much time to train
its enough i had a good rest this
week maybe thats what i needed i feel
all tuned up like a concert piano lets
go im hungry enough to eat a wolf
meaning me

  they laughed and went out arm n arm
vince had a cab waiting before the hotel
barney got in first as vince was closing
the door a petite black-haired girl darted
across the sidewalk crying

  vince vince

  vince snapped at the driver get go-
ing

  the cab leaped from the curb barney
twisted to look back at the girl standing
forlornly on the side walk

  thats    thats   he snapped his
fingers trying to remember

  thats a little tart named vera some-
thing thats been chasing me for a week
vince said quickly

  barney took a last glance at the small
receding figure i could have sworn it
was little jeanne henrouille he said

  vince laughed you got the henrou-
illes on the mind he scoffed jeanne was
never as skinny as that youre not wor-
ried about leon henrouille are you kid
what do you think asked barney
somberly

  well forget it i got good news for
you i got a letter from sammy sloan and
he says leons out of the hospital and
hes okay what do you think of that
from the tail of his eye vince watched
the mute thankfulness flood into barneys
face then quickly added

  but sammy says stay under cover
the warrants still out and leon aint
quite right in the head they expect hell
get over that though hell barney he
shook his brothers arm dont forget
there was four of them that jumped you
and theyd be crying out of the other isde
of their mouth if you was the one that was
walking on his heels

  yeah i guess so vince i just dont
like it hanging over me thats all

 trust sammy hell take care of
everything but for the time being he
said with a satisfied smirk lets enjoy
ourself

barney was at the gym early the
next morning he had a week just
one week to get in shape for salinski in
spite of what he had said to vince those
days of brooding lassitude had made him
a little soft had dulled his eyes a little
had taken the edge from his timing

  he ran ten miles a day most fighters
ran five but barney had the legs and wind
of a marathoner he worked on the light
bag to develop speed on the heavy bag
for power he skipped rope to sharpen his
foot work

  but mostly alec worked to fashion his
left into a killing weapon in a back room
he had barney go against two lightweights
with his right arm strapped to his side

  youre a right-hander he told barney
and thats where salinskill expect rock-
a-bye-baby to come from i want you to
forget for a couple days you even have a
right your lefts a killer but you havent
used it enough

  through all that hard week of training
alecs expression never changed his eye
never kindled with enthusiasm and his
voiae always had the same leaden timbre
his narrow face was still and bleak

  barneys speed returned his timing the
fire in his fists reporters who came to
watch his public work-outs left the gym
with a knowing glint in their eyes by the
night of the fight salinski was only a
- favorite of all the sports writers
jimmy duff alone remained cynically aloof
duff was just waiting to pounce

  barney and alec had to fight their way
from the cab to the back entrance as the
fans thronged the sidewalk they all
wanted to touch barney and they kept
shouting to him as familiarly as if they
had known him all their lives

  knock him bow-legged barney

  kill the bum

  barney grinned mitted them and fol-
lowed the two husky cops through the
path they made for him one character
in a dirty tweed cap boldly tried to walk
in with them but the cop at the door
collared him and he was forcibly pranced
across the sidewalk despite his protests

  hey cut it out im wit barney
lemme go hell make it tough for yiz
lemme go
one fist was irish	

  the cops laughed and left him standing
at the curb shaking his fists

  alec was pallid and shaking as barney
stretched out on the table and relaxed he
had warmed up with ten minutes of
shadow boxing and now he was just lying
there breathing deeply and evenly salin-
skis chief second came in and growled
lets get it over

  and barneys second began to tape his
hands alec ducked out to go to salinskis
dressing room to watch the same formality
there wasnt much chance of either using
plaster of paris on the tape or slipping an
iron in the gloves not with both knowing
duff was watching this bout with cynical
eyes

  salinskis second left after the job was
done and barney lay back on the table
closing his eyes he heard the door open
a strange voice said beat it you

  he sat up his own second wide-
eyed was slipping through the doorway be-
hind a burly man in a dusty derby beside
the man stood vince white-lipped they
were linked together with handcuffs the
man showed a badge

  get on your clothes nolan he said
shortly were taking a little trip
vince quavered barney    

  the mans hand came up from his side
he was holding a gun

  just get dressed nolan he advised
i got a warrant here and i got the extra-
dition papers assault with intent to kill
they want to see you back in tacoma
this monkey here he gave the handcuff
a jerk hes a material witness or some-
thing come on get your clothes on
barneys hands tightened so here it
was okay he said evenly

  vince wailed barney dont let him
take me back they dont want me as a
witness those henrouilles just want to
get their hands on me theyll kill me
barney

the detective said stolidly stop blub-
bering you get whats coming to you
snap it up nolan i aint got all night
he stepped back as barney slid from the
table barneys mind coiled sickenly

  does he have to come too he fal-
tered nodding at vince

-fight-fall

  hes a witness aint he

  i know but    what he says is the
truth the henrouilles just want to get
their hands on him

  cut the stalling

  listen just listen to me for a minute
im the one you got the warrant for let
him go and i wont give you any trouble
the detective laughed harshly dont
worry about that bud you aint gonna
give me no trouble anyway

  how much barney pleaded

  how much what

  how much to let him go he isnt
really needed as a witness there were
three other henrouilles there that night
that should be witness enough how much
to let him go

  the detectives eyes licked quickly
around the room how much you got
he asked in a business like voice

  five hundred that was all barney
did have

  the detective laughed again and waved
his gun get dressed he said go on
get dressed and stop talking baby talk
vince broke in wheedling look he
said take the money and put it on bar-
ney to win youll clean up

  just like that the detective jeered
i heard this guy salinski is pretty good
theyre betting - on him and this
punks gonna win just like that nuts
theyll kill him if you take him back
barney said

  thats not my business when i get
him back there my jobs ended

  look barneys hands were sweating
s-suppose i said you couldnt lose if you
bet on salinski would you let him go
then 

  the detective pursed his mouth well
he said slowly like that eh

  like that

  well now thats a little different
thats kind of a sure thing you might say
i got a couple thousand of my own id
put down on a bet like that but his
voice rasped im keeping this punk
cuffed to me till i see you flat on the
canvas see you later nolan youre
going back no matter what come on
he gave the handcuff a tug and vince
shambled out of the dressing room

viii

salinski came out fast at the bell
warily watching barneys long left he
worked to barneys right and slapped in
two left jabs of his own barneys head
jerked twice and he covered automatically
hunching his shoulders a little higher he
flat-footedly retreated before salinskis ad-
vance salinski kept always to his right
peppering away with that left

  he stabbed with his left but salinski
bobbed sideways and hammered him on
the ribs with a left barney winced salin-
ski could hit he could hit harder than any-
one hed ever met he covered and re-
treated slowly all of a sudden salinski
ducked his head went in under barneys
right and dug into his body with both
hands barney automatically tied him up

  youre going great alec whispered
as he sponged him off just take it easy
hell have to come to your left when he
wants to get in with that right of his
then let him have it

  but salinski seemed to have forgotten
he had a right he kept going in under
barneys right and slamming him with
those jolting lefts he rolled away from
every left barney threw

  he moved a little faster in round two
the crowd was yelling for blood and he
wanted to give it to them he picked
barneys left off in mid-air and slipped
in with a right that caught barney flush on
the nose a razor of pain sliced into
barneys brain and the blood was a shawl
over his mouth an chin salinski grinned
as he ducked under barneys left and
raged at his stomach with ripping hands
barney doubled under the tornado of pain
and salinski stepped back and calmly cut
his face to pieces with slicing hooks this
was the kind of work salinski liked chop
them up then cut them down-but chop
them up first

  barney reeled to his corner and lay
gasping on his stool while alec stopped the
flow of blood over his eyes with astringent
alec was hissing advice but barney did
not hear him his body was a torment
of pain and his broken nose throbbed
stabbing deep into his head with each
throb

  looking down into the press row he
saw duffs plump jeering face and he
knew that he wasnt putting up a battle
hed have to do better to save vince

  salinski came out confidently in the
third he had nothing to worry about
now he had solved barneys left and he
wasnt afraid of the right he came in
weaving and bobbing swinging hard for
the body barney shuffled his left foot
forward and nailed him on the side of the
face with a straight right the right salinski
thought no longer counted

  he went back on his heels and his hands
flew up barney stepped in sank a left to
the solar plexus and swung a right over
the dropping guard salinskis eyes went
glassy and he dropped to his knees bar-
ney stared at him with horror and the
referee had to thrust him forcibly to the
neutral corner barneys heart thudded
sickeningly as the referees inexorable arm
rose and fell salinski was on one knee
at seven and up at nine the referee
siezed his arms wiped off his gloves
against his shirt and stepped back

  salinski crouched as barney walked to-
ward him there was caution in salinskis
eyes and though barney boxed weakly he
kept the fight at arms length for the re-
mainder of the round

  alec wasnt in the corner when barney
went back to his stool

  the second sponged him briskly and
said he seen his wife up there and he
went back to have a word with her hell
be right back he says to keep after abe
with that left youll get broke in half
he says if abe finds out you got a right
but jeez it seems to me   

  barney said wearily resting his head
against the ropes okay okay give me
a little water

  he went out in the fourth determined
to take no chances of repetition of that
almost-disastrous knockdown but salinski
was not the kind of fighter you could
merely block you had to punch with him
he was too fast for purely defensive
tactics too smart the moment he found
barney holding back he rocked him with
a volley of rights and lefts blood-smeared
lips puffed one eye half closed from a
vicious left hook barney went down be-
one fist was irish



fore one minute of the round had passed
he took eight but salinski was raging
at him the moment he was up

  the crowd was on its feet baying as
he drove barney back into the ropes with
a ferocious body attack and pinned him
there rattling his jaw with one-twos
working down to the stomach again bar-
ney clutched holding himself together by
sheer nerve keeping himself on his feet
only because he knew he had to make it
look good weakly he fought back
through the haze of pain he saw salin-
skis face before him and he hooked a
right into it

  the face bobbed and he stabbed at it
with a left salinski crowded closer bury-
ing his head against barneys chest bar-
ney was numbly surprised salinski
shouldnt have done that he was throw-
ing away his advantage because now bar-
new was able to tie him up and they stood
locked until the referee parted them

  he did not know the bell had rung
until the referee grabbed him roughly by
the shoulder and growled break it up
break it up get back to your corner
he stumbled across the ring alec stood
on the apron waiting for him barneys
face was bad but alecs was ghastly the
yellow skin was so tight against his skull
that his bones stood out in sharp prom-
inence and his eyes burned deep in their
sockets

  alecs fluttering hands shoved him down
on the stool and alec sobbed this
slaughters gotta stop

  barney mumbled dont let them stop
it alec dont let them stop it not yet
listen alec bent over him his breath
hissing between his clenched teeth its a
frame there aint no detective from
tacoma that was just a mug your
brother rung in to make sure youd lose
vinces got five grand down on the fight
that detective is just a hot-shot who
hangs around the arena here tell him
he snapped at the second

  the seconds eyes followed his pointing
arm vince was sitting three rows back
smirking beside the dusty-derbied man
the second nodded

  his names harry fox he works the
numbers

ffoee kid alec snarled it was a

  o	frame and i framed you too i
had you work on that left i promised
salinski id keep your right dead thats
the reason he aint afraid of your right
i got dough down on the fight too-on
salinski but his mouth twisted it
dont make no difference no more i just
saw helen and she says she wont have
nothing to do with me if i had a million
but i fixed her he ground his teeth
and his eyes rolled wildly shes dead
out in the corridor with a bullet in her
head he swept over this as if it was
no longer of any consequence and heres
something else look down here recog-
nize that girl a black-haired girl stood
beside the ring and stared up with wide
frightened eyes thats jeanne henrou-
ille barney the little girl from the west
coast shes got something to tell you
tell him jeanne

  leons fine barney her voice trem-
bled hes ashamed they tried to beat you
up theres no warrant out for you and
he dont want me to marry vince anymore
i ran away sammy sloan told me you
were here i saw vince but    but   
tears welled up in her eyes h-he had
some men he wanted to do business with
and he wanted me to   he wanted me   
to be nice to them   

  she seemed to disappear before barneys
sodden eyes and vaguely he heard someone
cry catch her alec was snarling at
him again

  go out and kill salinski this round
kid tear him apart the way hes been
tearing you apart cut his heart out

 barney mumbled too late too
late  

  the hell it is he had you against
the ropes that last round and you snagged
him with a right and left and had him
holding on go out and kill him

 barney heard the bell he was no
longer pain-racked but he felt sodden and
numb he saw salinskis snakey left com-
ing over he moved his head and was
surprised when the glove missed him he
jabbed his own left into salinskis face
and was surprised when it landed it
wasnt a hard blow but it shouldnt have
landed it couldnt go on it was just luck


fight stories

   as if to confirm it salinski bobbed and
came in hard with a punishing attack to the
midsection barneys body arched away
from those stinging gloves but instead of
clinching he hooked a right and left to
salinskis ribs then brought up his right
and hooked to salinskis ear-and salinski
was moving away his beady eyes watched
the two red blobs that were barneys fists
so there was still thunder in them well
he could wait hed cut him up a little
more take some of the sap of him then
chop him down the fight was young he
moved to barneys right on those spindly
legs of his barney turned slowly

  something was building up inside him
something exploded blowing all the dust
out of the corners the long years had made
now he knew why hed had to go to
sammy sloan every so often for a fight
vince he remembered the storming fury
that rode his gloves and now he knew
why it was he had always seen vince
there in the ring with him vinces jeering
face that canuck dupre had looked
like vince

  he had known right from the beginning
that vince was something evil that had to
-be destroyed but he had never faced it
he had tried to take the blame himself
to tell himself that he was the evil but
vince had always dirtied everything he
touched he felt suddenly clean and re-
freshed he didnt have to worry about
vince anymore

  for the first time he seemed to see
salinski there in the ring with him-a
tall man with thin legs and a chest that
was too heavy for him a man with cruelty
in his little eyes a man with a knowing
twist on his slitted mouth barney went
toward him up on his toes weaving he
jabbed with his left and salinski bobbed
as he knew he would-bobbed straight into
a driving right salinski staggered and
rushed for a clinch but barney nailed him
with a short right and drove him back
with a left

   salinski stood straddle-legged and tried
to slug it out thinking this a short-lived
flurry but barney was waiting for him
he slipped a right and his left went up in

a short arc salinskis legs went watery
and he half stumbled and was half ham-
mered back to the ropes his eyes were
unfocussed but he fought automatically
barney got him into the corner and stand-
ing flat-footed wove from side to side as
he drove in a savage right and left

  salinski was out on his feet his guard
was as loose as a torn pocket barney
could have hit him with anything but that
festering fury no longer drove him in-
stead of tearing into him as he had into
a moore as he had into heinie pfaff
he stepped back and mercifully let salinski
fall to the floor he helped them drag
salinski to his stool

  as he walked to his own corner he
heard a shout and three loud claps as if
someone had slapped two boards together
a woman screamed and there was the
thunder of frantic feet as the crowd at
the left side of the ring rushed for the
exits

  a blue-coated policeman ran across the
ring tugging at his hip and leaped over
the ropes barneys second was standing
on his stool staring over the bobbing
heads his hand trembled at his slack
mouth he looked down at barney

  your brother he gibbered alec just
shot him then shot himself theyre lay-
ing on the floor

 barney turned the crowd bubbled
around the spot where vince had been
sitting and three policemen were fighting
their way through it barney turned away
stooped and picked up his robe he tried
to feel sorry for vince but all the others
crowded into his mind helen frazer dead
from her husbands bullet alec jeanne
henrouille leon henrouille how many
others had there been

  jeanne henrouille sat frozen in the seat
at ringside where kindly hands had placed
her after her faint around her was
turmoil as men leaped  their chairs
craning their necks to see better but she
just sat staring straight ahead

  barney jumped down from the apron
come on jeanne he said theres
nothing for us here he led her up the
aisle
leather
larceny

by larry sternig

this kid they practically dragged into
the ring    made him fight    made
him yellow    made him tough   
made him champ

there was no one watching now
the jeweler was busy at the other
end of the counter and the few cus-
tomers in the store were engaged in busi-
ness of their own

  my hand went toward the watch and
then stopped my heart was beating fast and
my entire body trembled but the urge was
there again like some demon possessing me
and my hand went on it went on and closed
around the watch

  i was aware then of a movement at my
side

  but i kept my hand closed and put it in
my pocket

  a voice murmured i thought you were
on parole jimmy arent you being
foolish 

  i turned it was tim dolan

  i said what the hell are you talking
about 

  about the watch you just stole about
a top welterweight going in for petty lar-
ceny

  i tried to bluff it out but tim merely
said i could have you searched a man on
parole isnt above suspicion at any time
you know

  i thought of the time id spent in that
place of the iron doors and my mouth
turned dry there wasnt anything i could
say

  come along with me tim suggested
my office is just a few doors from here

   i followed him dumbly fearfully hate for
tim dolan stirring in me a hate that was
to grow from that moment on

  we walked down a half block and turned
into a small office building we went up two

floors to a door marked t dolan man-
ager-promoter

  he waved me to a chair next to his desk
he wasted no words he said i havent
had a champ for a long time jimmy not
for over a year

  i looked at him suspiciously tim dolan
had a very good name in the fight game
tim dolan wasnt the kind to interest him-
self in a washed-up fighter nor would he
stoop to blackmail i hoped

  ill take forty per cent tim went on
calmly thats what i always take you
can move out to the farm youll be away
from temptation there

  ive got a manager i reminded him
and i cant fight anyway the commis-
sion wont let me

  you had a manager tim said a
manager who tore up your contract the day
you got into trouble ill take care of the
commission

  is this blackmail

  tims eyes were blank this is black-
mail

  you could go to jail for that i re-
minded him




fight stories

  he nodded we could go together we
could be cell-mates

  okay i said you win this round
but if i ever get the chance- i choked
back the threat that rose in my throat

  i was a pretty fair middle myself once
tim said he held out his hand ill take
the watch be back here in an hour with
your clothes

the farm was neat and green and sur-
rounded with fresh air under any
other circumstances it would have been
ideal for me i stood there on the porch
that afternoon taking it all in and some of
the distraction left my mind

  i was city born and city bred and id
known nothing but its clamor and its smoke
all my life i took a deep breath and my
dislike for tim dolan dimmed for a mo-
ment

  a voice said nice view isnt it 

  i turned a girl stood there a plain girl
but one who created the illusion of beauty
because of superb health a girl with clear
eyes and a complexion there are no words
for and a smile that went straight to my
heart

  it is i agreed i was staring at her
and realizing it i blushed and looked awk-
wardly at my hands

  i think youll like it here she said
smiling dad and i will try to see that
you do she held out a hand im tims
daughter ellen

  oh i said and there was a tinge of
bitterness in my voice i barely touched
the hand

  i went inside and up to the room tim
had assigned me i sat there on the bed
and my mind passed over the days events
i felt annoyed

  tim put me on a routine the next day
a routine of road work and bag punching
and swimming tim intended to build up
the body that prison life had softened

  i went through it obediently i went
through it like a bad child who was being
disciplined and though i knew the situa-
tion was ridiculous i also knew there
wasnt a thing i could do about it because
tim dolan had connections and tims
word could put me back to that place that
gave me nightmares

  i saw little of ellen and i was thankful
for that the few times id seen her some-
thing strange and new had happened to
my heart and id felt a sharp regret over
the first days rudeness

  all that was needed to make this set-up
tougher was for me to fall in love with her

  then a couple of other boys from tims
stable came up to train and i had a chance
to mix it with them one of the boys vic
grant was a welter and a good one

  i mixed with vic for two short rounds
and took the pasting of my life tim saw it
all and a wrinkle deepened between his
eyes and he called a halt

  he told me this vic is good but not
that good havent lost your heart have
you boy

  my timing is off i said and my wind
isnt all back but this vic could probably
take me anyway i was never a champ you
know

  you never had the title tim corrected
me he paused dont think all the wrong
things about me jimmy theres a chance
you may be wrong

  you can tell me what to do i said
but i can think what i please i turned
on that and went to the showers

  vic grant was unlacing his shoes when
i came in he was a short man even for a
yvelter with a sluggers build he said to
me tim figuring on building you up or
just till lie can peddle you

  i wouldnt know i said

  vic shook his square head well its a
screwy set-up here i figured im really
going to get some promotion and he picks
a has-been from the clink

  i looked him over slowly while the bit-
terness in me boiled i looked him over
slowly-and said nothing

  when i came out again after my shower
vic was talking to tim and by the tone of
his voice he wasnt pleased

  i went up to my room

  tim came in a few minutes later he
said i fixed you up for a prelitn spot for
next week its not much but its the best
i could do you arent ready for any big
guns yet anyway

  i asked what did vic have to say

  a muscle ridged in tims jaw he said
that if he didnt get a crack at the title in
leather

larceny



six months i wouldnt be his manager

  i shook my head i mean what did he
say about me 

  tim looked at me for a moment then
he said you were yellow

  i smiled maybe i am

  i dont think so tim said and left

  i thought back to the night of my crime
for the first time since the trial id be
facing a crowd of people people who knew
my story it had been news big news a
year ago and they wouldnt have forgotten
i knew enough about fight crowds to fear
that

  i didnt mix with vic in the days that
followed tim imported a couple of boys
and i began to get the range again but i
was a long way from my best

  ellen drove me in the afternoon of the
fight shed been civil since that first day
but only civil today she seemed to be
going out of her way to be friendly

  she said dad told me-about-about
your trouble and he told me- she
faltered

  about blackmailing me

  she kept her eyes on the road ahead if
thats the way you put it she paused
that night that night it happened did
you need the money

  my laugh was short i didnt even know
there was money in the purse

  she nodded as though suddenly under-
standing it was at a party wasnt it you
were excited nervous

  it was at a party i repeated as
though talking from some grim dream
one of those fancy parties where the elite
invite a fighter for the atmosphere or some-
thing i walked into a room and there were
some womens coats on the bed and some
purses i dont know what happened after
that i simply couldnt help what i did and
the purse i took happened to have a lot
more money in it than any purse should
i was looking down at my hands and the
shame in me brought a flush to my face

  ellens voice was soft you mustnt
think of yourself as a criminal youve got
to forget that you-you were sick theres
a word for it and i think you know it its
a sickness

  you think your dad would take advan-
tage of a sick man you admit that

  she didnt say anything for a minute
and when she did talk she evaded my ques-
tion she said dad isnt very often wrong
about people i hope he wasnt wrong about
you

in the dressing room that night the
tenseness that had grown in me the past
weeks reached its peak i could feel it
physically in the tightening of my muscles
in the hammering of my heart tim was
with me every second and tims eyes were
off of me for very few of those seconds

  the call came finally and i went out
with tim and a handler out and up the
aisle

  i could feel tims presence could
sense that he was walking very closely be-
side me the handler flanked my other side

  one of the boys was coming down the
winner and getting a hand then the crowd
spotted me and i held my breath and
prayed there was a silence a sort of sub-
dued murmur then someone yelled
lookit the man of steal

  a laugh went up a short laugh that dis-
solved in a bedlam of talk i kept my eyes
on the glare ahead and the bitterness
surged in my taut body

  we went up and through the ropes and
a part of the tautness melted for this was
the old glare the old smell the old noise
this was home

  i looked over in the opposite corner at
my opponent of the evening a hairy bulky
lad named stover a lad who looked like
hed been to the wars once too often

  the ref was introducing us and i dread-
ed the reception i expected but the only
sign of the crowds sentiment was the weak-
ness of applause

  id had a crazy notion during the past
few days of throwing this fight just as a
way of getting back at tim dolan but i
knew now that i couldnt do it

  maybe i wouldnt have to

  stover came out with a rush at the bell
crouching and trying his best to look mur-
derous i put a jab in his face and stood
my ground stover stopped and began to
circle

   i circled with him kept pushing that left
hand in his face vexing him into a lead
stover came in under the left and put a
	fight stories

heavy hook into my middle i tied him up

  we broke and i was short with a left i
missed a right and stover closed again
this time stovers hook really shook me
i back-pedaled jabbing my chin was
buried

 but stover came in again and he
brought a right to my throat that gagged
me

the lights began to waver as i hung on

stover was pummelling my midriff
viciously slamming away with both hands

  then the lights went out

  i heard a great buzzing in my ears and
the pinwheel overhead seemed to be de-
scending on me somebody was calling out
numbers i heard 

  i rose groggily to one knee at  at 
i was up

  stover rushed in for the finisher and i
put the remnants of my strength into a
whistling right it landed with a splat on
stovers nose

  the bell

  tim said this guy is strictly a mixer
keep him clear he shouldnt be able to get
within shouting distance of you

  stover came out for the second with a
very red nose and a little more caution he
moved around in a shell and i took the of-
fensive

  i was short with a straight left and then
threw a right that wasnt short i connccted
to stovers eyes with another straight left
and then my right whistled to the button

  stover went back into the ropes and i
followed him in but stover tied me up

  the ref parted us and we moved to the
center of the ring stover circling my left
keeping him clear again stover rushed
and this time i was ready

  i put my weight into a straight left and
then crossed a hard right stover went back
-and crashed

  i walked to a neutral corner and the
thunder of the crowd was sweet music to
my ears

  my timing was back this round and even
if stover should get up i knew i could take
him now

  stover did get up

  i moved in and feinted him into a lead
i was set and really put my weight into a
right smash

his time stover didnt get up

  he was a club fighter this stover
and hed been licked a lot of times but
victory is always sweet i almost felt normal
back in the dressing room

  tim said you looked like your old self
for about a minute there when you are
well get you some good boys

  i nodded my eyes averted

  the next days papers gave the bout
more ink than it was worth it had what
newspapermen call human interest and
the whole account of my crime and subse-
quent imprisonment went with it i winced
as i read it and the hate i had for tim
dolan was fired anew

  later that morning when i came in from
a two mile jog tim introduced me to a tall
expensively dressed man

  dr barton is a psychiatrist tim ex-
plained and he wants to ask you some
questions

  i didnt like the sound of that but i sub-
mitted grudgingly for almost an hour i
answered questions as honestly as i could

  later i heard dr barton talking to tim
i heard the phrase compulsion neurosis
and unstable emotional condition  i felt
like a human guinea pig

  despite my poor mental condition how-
ever my physical health was coming back
to its former peak my timing was still bad
but my speed and wind were nearly what
they were i mixed with a better than aver-
age lightweight that afternoon and scored
often on that fleet target

  ellen was watching me from the ringside
and she smiled as we finished the round in
a flurry of leather you looked like a
champ for that last round she told me

  i managed a grin i feel like an insect
on a slide who was that doctor that gave
me the third degree this morning

  hes one of the best psychiatrists in the
country ellen said and he agreed with
tim about you

  and what was their verdict 

  she was silent for a moment then she
said with a smile they think youre one of
the best welterweight prospects theyve
seen

  all right i said im a little ooy and
i cant take the truth whatever it is it
cant be worse than a purse snatcher
leather

  she made a face whatever it is youll
know when theyre sure

  suddenly i blurted i was thinking-
theres a good movie in the village tonight
-and-nh-i-

  id love it she said

  it was a good movie and there was a
great big musical comedy moon hanging
in the sky as we drove home we stood on
the porch for a minute before turning in
and the moon combined with ellens fra-
grance was a little too much for me

  my lips came down to hers and her lips
answered

  i said shakily i-ive had a girl or
two but not like-i mean for me this is it
i knew it since that first day

  she nodded me too

  i didnt get much sleep that night the
one thing that could happen to make the
situation unbearable had happened id have
to talk it over with tim in the morning

  but in the morning ellen told me
youd better not say anything to dad about
us right now he and vic had a quarrel
this morning and he gave vic his contract
back

  i figured that was coming i said and
i think tim lost a gold mine that vic will
be champ soon

  ellen nodded thats what started the
quarrel vics been promised a chance at
the title by another manager if he could buy
his contract back

  ill bet tim got plenty for it i said
ellen looked at me queerly sometimes
i wonder why i love you he didnt get a
dime for it

  i smiled but said nothing loyalty was a
virtue i particularly admired and i loved
ellen all the more for it

tim arranged another bout for me the
next week it was a wind-up this time
in a small club and my opponent was a trial
horse whod crashed many a hopeful to the
canvas

  i sent him to slumberland in the fourth
round

  and the next morning i had my talk
with tim about ellen

  tim said ellens old enough to know
her own mind but itll be kind of tough on
her dont you think married to a man who

larceny	

hates her dad

  i had no answer for that

  in the next three weeks i had three more
bouts and won them all

  and the night i won my last bout vic
grant won the welterweight title

  i told ellen tim never had a real line
on that boy but i knew i mixed with a lot
of them and i can tell a champ when i see
one

  maybe dad was blind ellen said
slowly when it came to welterweights
maybe he could only see one boy

  i grinned maybe-and maybe not
that afternoon tim dolan asked me
would you like a shot at the title would
you like a crack at your old friend
youre the boss i said

  they want you now-in a couple of
weeks tim said in six months youd be
too hot to handle but by then we might not
get the chance he paused think you
can take him

  i dont think i ever saw the day i could
take him i said modestly but i can
try

  tim shook his head that isnt enough
ill turn them down his eyes were on the
ground it might be your last chance at the
crown jimmy

  i wont lose any sleep over that

  the afternoon papers carried the story
of a manager whod refused a title fight
it was comparable to a man biting a dog
and good for a column

  i realized then that id put tim on the
spot for it was he whod refused the fight
i didnt feel too good about that

  i went to him i said accept the fight
tim i dont know whether i can lick him
or not but i promise that ill fight the best
fight of my life

  whether you can lick him or not youve
got to think you can tim said but thatll
be my job to make you think that way
as it turned out however it wasnt
tims job for that evening ellen told me
something that made my blood boil

  that night she said when we went
to the movie i stayed downstairs after you
went to bed to do some bookwork for dad
and vic came in her eyes left my face
he-well he got a little fresh and i
slapped him dad happened to walk in just


fight stories

then she paused thats why he gave
vic his contract back

  i reached over to hold her head in my two
hands i kissed her gently that guy will
know hes been in a fight honey i promise
you

  the next two weeks were a grind the
toughest training grind of my career for
i had a lot to regain in those two weeks
and id need all the moxie i ever had for
this one

  two days before the bout i began to
taper off to prevent going stale i saw a lot
of tim during those two days and tim
said to me one afternoon id like to think
you thought enough of me to know im hon-
est id like to think you wouldnt need
an explanation from me

  i was silent studying him finally i
said i do think youre honest tim i
guess the whole town knows that i shook
my head ive been well-rattled even
before that happened that thing that sent
me up id been unsettled nervous

  tim nodded this urge this desire to
steal had you had it before that night
my thoughts raced only in my mind
if you get what i mean i mean id see
things in stores and the thought of taking
them would come to me but i didnt think
it was serious i mean a fellow gets a lot
of thoughts he doesnt follow through with
that was one of them until that night
you should have explained that to the
judge tim said he paused you know
what kleptomania is jimmy

  i nodded uh-huh and i think id
rather be tagged a criminal than a nut

  it isnt insanity tim said your un-
settled condition had something to do with
it maybe we all have a touch of it-some-
thing for nothing thats a pretty common
fault thats why i-blackmailed you i
wanted to keep your mind occupied on the
one thing you knew best and i wanted to
get you up here where its quiet i wanted
to cure you if i could

  i realized then that all this should have
been clear to me from the first day i said
humbly thanks tim i think you have
cured me but why why go to all this
trouble for a guy you only knew slightly
because tim said i think youre the
best welterweight in the world and be-

cause-i always want to see the best man
at the top in this game

the three of us drove in together the
morning of the fight and i felt more
physically and mentally fit than i had at
any time within my memory id need to
be for this one tonight for i had a lot more
respect for vic grant than tim did ellen
had been right about her dad tim dolan
was blind in the welterweight field he
could only see one man and that was his
man-jimmy powers

  the manager had released the psy-
chiatrists opinion of my malady and the
papers had given it a play i wasnt sure
whether to feel vindicated or further con-
demned one thing was certain i was the
most publicized welter in the game

  there seemed to be a hundred reporters
at the weighing in and another hundred
waiting for us at the hotel i kept my mouth
tightly shut and let tim do all the talking
tim dolan was a master at it

  in the dressing room that night tim
shooed them all out he told me keep
clear for two rounds at least even if they
start to boo for two rounds vic is better
than you are that much ill admit after
that hes not in your league

  grinning i shook my head if i could
only fight like you think i can

  ellen was there then for a final word
and i told her if i win tonight its be-
cause of you this brawl i now dedicate to
you

  she kissed me lightly knock him into
the cheap seats jimmy

  then the call came and we went out to-
ward the lights the house was a sell-out
jam packed the biggest crowd id ever
faced but there was no tenseness in me
beyond the normal tenseness expected for
a title bout

  i went up the aisle with tim and two
handlers and the crowds reception was
hearteiling i had a glimpse of ellen as i
climbed between the ropes and she held her
small clenched hands aloft

  on my stool as i relaxed while vics
new manager came over to inspect my
hands my eyes were on the man across the
ring a good man broad and husky with
those muscle bunches in his back that
leather

labeled the hitter a champion tim dolan
had brought him up to this tim had
brought us both this far and tim thought
i was the better man i certainly hoped so

  we went out for the introductions for
the instructions we went back to our cor-
ners to flex the bell and we turned

  vic came in like a tornado he came in
like dempsey used to in his prime and he
landed two fists to my midriff that actually
hurtled me back into the ropes

  the crowd gasped and then rose with
a hoarse cry it was the fastest opening any
of them had ever seen-or i for that mat-
ter and i was on the receiving end

  vic came in with his left hooking vi-
ciously and took about three-quarters of
my starch in the first ten seconds i wilted
got my hands inside and hung on

  the ref broke us and i got on my bi-
cycle

  for two minutes i kept clear of the
charging vic kept my left pumping weakly
while my stomach settled while the crowd
howled

 then i braced up snapped home a
straight left and was short with a right
vic tried to close but i had the range with
my left now and my timing was flawless
i managed to stay clear for the rest of the
round and scored twice with the right

  in my corner tim said whirlwind
stuff and he didnt do it he shot his
bolt

  we hope i said

  we hoped in vain vic stormed out for
the second in a flurry of flying leather that
sent me into a backward march it was
armstrong stuff i rode it out landing that
stinging jab enough to keep the champ cau-
tious bringing home a short right that
stopped him in his tracks for a second

  i moved in lightly circling a little look-
ing for a hole for my right vic turned with
me contempt in his eyes and a smile on his
heavy lips

i feinted twice and landed a left tried
a right that missed i moved around
him using the left like a riveting machine
and vic took it all with a grin

  angered i moved in to mix-and vic
brought up a killer from his knees

larceny	

  i fell forward and hung on while my
head cleared vic went to work below i
broke stepped clear and tried to paste him
with a left but vic had smelled blood
again and no jab was going to slow him

  he chased me for the remainder of the
round

  the fans were booing at the bell

  tim said i could have been wrong
about that guy but i wasnt wrong about
you youve taken his best punch you can
open up a little now

  i almost laughed in his face at that one
i said did you bring some spinach  what
ive got doesnt seem to be enough

  what youve got will be too much tim
said

  the third was slower vic seemed to
think he could win this one when the time
came but there was no hurry he countered
and parried circling always moving in a
semi-crouch

  i did open up a little my right was mov-
ing in now short and swift but vic was
pretty much in a shell and few of them
landed heavily

  i began to set up things with the left
feinting looking for openings but vic
wasnt champ for nothing vic didnt bite
vic taunted me smiling and vic moved in
toward the end of the round and brought
the hook with him it was a good hook

  i was weary at the bell id taken a lot
during those first two rounds more than
i could have taken a month ago and i re-
alized how far along tims conditioning
had brought me

  the fourth was faster vic began to mix
again but i had his rhythm now and i beat
him to the punch vic stepped up the pace
and i stepped with him for twenty seconds
we traded then i broke stepped back-
and stopped

  vic rushed and i met him with a straight
right that landed squarely on the button

  vic went back a half step and toppled

  vic was up at  i didnt rush i came in
cautiously and brought the left in sharply
twice before trying another right vic was
still alert the right was shorthand vic
tried to close

  i tied him up at the bell

  tim said thats the jimmy powers we
used to know thats the powers whos
	fight

going to be champ like loughran like
tunney like silk

  the fifth was slow vic wouldnt lead
and i couldnt quite penetrate the armor
in the fifth i could sense a change of crowd
sympathy id stood up well those first two
rounds and lived to hand it out they liked
that

  toward the end of the round i moved in
swiftly trying a desperate right it never
landed

  vic put his weight into a right hand
blow that landed flush on my jaw the
lights went out and the canvas came up
and hit me

  i didnt even hear the count until it
reached  and then i rose too soon vic
came in like a cannonball and landed again

  i stumbled into the ropes at the bell

  tim and the handlers worked like beav-
ers tim was muttering something inco-
herent massaging the back of my neck
then i felt the chill of a cold towel

  vic came out with a rush for the sixth
he landed heavily with the hook and tried
that right again i moved in desperately
and the right went around my neck but
vic was beating a sickening tattoo on my
stomach then the champ stepped clear
and threw his sunday punch

  again i managed to step away from it
vic came in carelessly and i threw a right
at the blob that should have been his jaw
it was vic stumbled back three steps and
went into his crouch

  i moved in slowly my head a buzzsaw
my footwork ragged i kept the left pump-
ing automatically and the right cocked

stories

  i got through that round on all the finesse
id picked up through the years and i
needed it all

  in my corner tim said this is the
round this is the one they wont expect
you to mix how are you feeling jimmy
are you up to it

  i think so i said and i hope youre
right

  so i went out slowly and waited to see
the attack vic would launch but vic had
the same idea in mind we stalled for a
full minute while the fans grew restless

  then vic moved in and i answered the
challenge for seconds wc exchanged for
seconds i slugged it out with the best
slugger in the field and the slugger came
out second best

  vic was weary when we broke vic was
wilting and my left lanced out sharply
vic tried a wild right and i crossed over it

  it landed and for a fraction of a second
vic seemed to hesitate it was all i needed
i put my hundred and forty-seven pounds
into a sunday punch i put all my weight
and all my hate into it and sent it over with
a prayer

  it was the one

  they carried vic to his corner and the
ref came over to raise my right arm aloft
then the crowd poured into the ring

  i saw them all through a mist because
the one that mattered most was coming to-
ward me a smile on her face and arms out-
stretched one more theft and then no
more id have to steal tims daughter but

i	knew tim dolan wouldnt mind this

by francis k allan

 in a strange city things are different for a fighter a fighter like joe corey
 anyway you take the big hive collect the moola tlrink and forget but
 tonight joe was home    and the marbles were on the table for everyone

to see

the loneliness and the reality
trapped him finally the train was
gone and the song of the rails
could no longer lull his thoughts

  here the sharp june sunlight glistened
on the sticky asphalt streets a sucking
whine was left in the wake of speeding
cars the tall buildings shimmered in the
heat waves his shirt clung limply to his
broad shoulders there was not a single
familiar face no band was here no may-
or with a gilded key this was a home-
coming for you and joe corey laughed-
a rough laugh that ended abruptly

  sure this was the way to come home

or maybe it was he thought slowly in
thirty-six hours it would be over the
train would take him back to new york
between now and then it could be like a
hall-like a long silent hall that you
walked through you didnt open the
doors you made no noise you passed
through and were gone yes that was the
best way

  it seemed to simplify something in joes
mind he lifted his worn suitcase from
the curb and moved toward the line of
waiting cabs the sun glistened in his
brown sandy hair and deepened the color
of his broad rough face he carried his


	fight stories

coat under his arm he walked with a
stalking grace his shoulders leading his
heels scarcely meeting the pavement there
was a heavy rhythm and power in his
motion

  he sat forward in the cab rubbing his
knuckles with the great palm of his left
hand he saw the new post office the
trackless trolleys and he kept searching
among the strange faces

  how many of them would be there to-
morrow night twenty thousand per-
haps thirty thousand rising out beyond
the glare of the ring they would know
him then here and there someone would
say corey came from here remember
 sam krebble this same guy thats got
dulaney he used to manage him he was
at the top there was nobody    that
was five years ago then something hap-
pened in pittsburgh i dont know i dont
think they ever proved anything   

  the fingers of his great hands were
twisted tightly together

  the marsden hotel was a fat brown
structure-a shabby old lady resting com-
placently on the outskirts of the business
district joe put on his hat and coat before
he went in the lobby was shadowy and
cooler he saw the poster thumb-tacked
to the bulletin board the name flamed
across the top in crimson letters-baron
dulaney

  joe looked at the curly blond hair in
the picture at the smooth unbattered face
the level eyes below in smaller letters
was joes name he was glad they hadnt
used a picture

  ah joe the shrill greeting turned
him around little sam krebble came
panting across the lobby his tie askew his
suit wrinkled it might have been the
same cigar of five years ago to see you
and looking so good sam gasped his
black eyes sparkled as he grasped joes
hand

  hello sam joe smiled and held the
smile as the little guys eyes darted over
his frame

  inever have i seen you looking better
sam pronounced

  im allright for thirty-two anyway

  that is but childhood when you have
lived as long as sam    he wagged his

head mournfully and steered joe toward
the elevator he explained why he hadnt
met the train he mopped his damp jowls
he assured joe that his indigestion was
definitely worse

  joe was grateful for the rush of words

he followed sam into the room that
had been reserved for him it was
large and slightly shabby the windows
faced west beneath the glare of the sink-
ing sun the city rolled gently out into a
bluish haze sam turned on the overhead
fan and the blades generated a monoto-
nous drone the air remained thick and
sticky

  dorsey will come in later sam was
explaining dorsey was the man who
would handle him tomorrow night joe
remembered it is all arranged at the
downtown club if you want anything
and about dorsey-as soon would i trust
myself that is right joe

  well get along there wont be much
to do

  a silence formed deepened by the drone
of the fan sam fretted his cigar joe
massaged his knuckles until they were wet
and he rubbed them against his coat sam
cleared his throat you have seen du-
laney 

  once about three years ago his last
light before he went into the army

  he is faster now heavier a left like
never before sam blinked at him for
you it will not be so easy tomorrow night
joe

  what the hell sam i know what i
came for me tomorrow maybe dorati
next month then the championship in the
fall im glad its your show anyway
he said more quietly twenty-five hun-
dred dollars can buy a lot of rounds from
me now and instantly joe felt the im-
pact of the unplanned words his eyes
locked with sams between them leaped
up the recollection of that night in pitts-
burgh the paski fight sams eyes elec-
tric with outrage his round face apoplec-
tic his voice quivering carried him
you carried him that money should
ever mean so much to you that you should
turn    turn crook for you and me it
is quits
homecoming



  there were countless times thereafter
when joe had tried to understand to re-
trace and ask himself his reason for ten
thousand dollars why    no it wasnt
just the money he could make that had
he wanted to please silvestri  perhaps 
it was all part of the swift new intoxica-
tion new friends new places the sud-
den fame it had come so swiftly that
rich thick wine

  why did you give me this fight sam
the inevitable question slipped from joes
lips sam looked at him straight

  you are smart dulaney will learn
from you and for you-

  for me the twenty-five hundred joe
supplied evenly thats okay i need it
you knew that when you wired me itll
be a good fight for a while

  not just the money for you    sam
began he stopped and rubbed his chin
he sighed and held out his hand but it
is time for me to go he held out his
hand after he had opened the door he
paused yesterday i saw letty she was
asking   he glanced at joe

  joe tightened his fingers walk softly
down the hall he was thinking leave the
door closed it will soon be over

  sam frowned slowly he closed the door
and was gone

  dorsey dropped in just after five oclock
he was a stoop-shouldered man of about
fifty with faded wise eyes and a melan-
choly voice after they shook hands dor-
sey seemed ill-at-ease he sat there creas-
ing a newspaper between his bony hands
and blinking at the window joe was glad
when he left

  he took off his coat loosened his tie
and stretched out on the bed he unfolded
the crumpled newspaper dorsey had left
it was the sports section of the herald
at the left was a box-column looking
them over with levlitt joe remembered
ben levlitt from high school-a thin hay-
haired boy with a touch of wry humor
the column discussed the fight devoting
three-quarters of its space to an examina-
tion of dulaneys maturing skill and pow-
er the final paragraph looked at joe

  few fights it said have held the irony
of this one scarcely five years ago joe
coreys star was in its ascendancy the

championship twinkled just ahead then
on a july night in pittsburgh there was
exhibited one of the most intriguing fits
of chivalry since the era of king arthur
this ten-round waltz marked both the
turning point of coreys career and the
end of his association with sam krebble
his manager and today the manager of
baron dulaney mr corey began to take
an intense interest in the full life doing
his fighting from the west corner of man-
hattans high top club it is rumored he
chose a liquid diet tomorrow night will
be something of a homecoming-

  joe hurled the paper to the floor a
wounded cry broke from his jaws why
did they have to keep riding hifn why
wouldnt they forget

  he covered his eyes with his arm
something kept squeezing in his stomach
making him hot and breathless this was a
crazy thing why hadnt he realized a
beating like this for twenty-five hundred
it wasnt the thing that would happen to-
morrow night in the ring that was easy
it was this-this ripping at his pride
this    and joe stopped and laughed
acidly that was a word pride

  he hurled himself from the bed and
stalked around the room shaking his head
like a stunned animal he looked at him-
self in the mirror his eyes burned dark
and tormented the skin of his cheeks felt
drawn and old he felt desperately tired
and lonely

pride    this time joe did not
laugh it was true he couldnt ex-
plain it but he knew it was true and it
was such a fragile thing like a scrap of
lace salvaged and laboriously cleaned
mended with clumsy fingers until a pat-
tern was formed again but it was still
so frail this pride and they wouldnt let
it alone if only--

  the gentle knock came at the door joe
turned his chest rising and falling heavily
angrily he jerked the door open what
do you- the raw words evaporated he
stepped back his arms sagged to his sides

  she woreno hat just a summer dress
white and soft from the look in her eyes
now he knew she had been smiling be-
fore she saw him slowly she smiled again
	fight

sam told me you would be here

  sam  oh he fumbled with his hands
her smile was ebbing again joe gestured
vaguely yeah sam he made the reserv-
ation her quiet blue eyes searched his
her fingers rested on the door her smile
had faded im sorry if  do you want
me to go joe

  i dont    no please i was just
thinking when you knocked i wasnt ex-
pecting  he stumbled back and
pushed out a chair sit here letty its a
little cooler under the fan

  she closed the door softly he could not
take his eyes away from her had she al-
ways been so small so slender her hair
seemed so much darker her eyes so much
more blue she sat down tucking her legs
under shed always done that joe found
himself waiting for the plop-plop of her
shoes as she pushed them off

  he sat down her job    she didnt
work for the oil company shes been with
her father at the store since he fell and
hurt his hip her mother was fine shed
wondered if joe would come to supper

  they talked while the fan droned in the
ceiling and the sunlight drained from the
windows they talked carefully of little
things she was living in crestview now
it was a new addition built on the old
municipal golf course

  he listened to the gentle lilt of her
words her face seemed to grow more
lovely more delicate in the shadows then
he scarcely listened he thought of the last
time he had seen her two years after that
thing in pittsburgh a month after hed lost
the cadillac to silvestri it hadnt been a
walk-out joe knew that now it had been
the christmas songs the toys in the win-
dows and the bitter emptiness she had
come home now thinking back joe was
so grateful that she hadnt been there the
next year

  it was dark now nests of lights twin-
kled on the horizon of the city lets go
back to dundees joe said remember
those lobsters

  theyd eaten there a lot the first year
theyd been married but it was gone now
it was called the crescent grill now
now the walls were white a nickelodeon
wailed loudly old dundee was gone there

stories

was a lean sleek-haired man behind the
cash register

  all the little things were said they
looked at each other they were silent
and then letty touched his hand tell
me really joe tell me how things are

  he wanted to tell her his throat ached
with a yearning if only he could make
her believe i tried to think i spent a
long time thinking he began i didnt
take a drink i havent    he stopped
it took a long time-

  sure its him like on the poster you
dope

  joe glanced around there were four
of them-the oldest not more than twelve
they stood at the side of the booth star-
ing at him boldly aint you joe corey
the one with the freckles challenged

  sure thats me joe grinned and held
out his hand

  like i said the kid said triumphant-
ly my uncle was there he seen it the
words rang through the room the sleek
man was watching the waitresses were
staring said it was a fix and a bunch of
gamblers sure cleaned up

  joe was frozen something horribly hot
exploded in his chest

  my uncle he told me- the kid was
saying again

  the terrible thing seared into joes
brain and blinded him a cry of rage
broke from his lips he leaped from the
booth the kids scattered yelling with
fear joe dont let- letty cried

  he stopped and swayed like someone
jerked from a nightmare the room was
filled with eyes and faces the kids were
gone he stood there alone in the shame
and silence he couldnt stand it he
lunged toward the door

  hey were not running a soup line
pal pay your check the sleek man
snapped

  its all right joe letty said huskily
ill meet you he didnt wait he want-
ed to run-to run so fast that the wind
would cool the flame of his face to run
so far that the voices would be lost for-
ever he kept going stalking deeper and
deeper into the old section of the city his
teeth were clenched his fists knotted

  the scent of beer came to him it was
homecoming



a little hole-in-the-wall bar he stopped
his chest rising and falling like a bellows
it had been so long    suddenly he didnt
care it made no difference they wouldnt
let you forget no matter what you did
he walked into the place and sat down at
the first stool he ordered a rye and
water it burned going down he ordered
another

  getting in your last training licks
corey the question was careless ironic
joe twisted around and there stood ben
levlitt the sports-writer he was grin-
ning and his lean face seemed to twitch

 get out get away from me joe
whispered

  how does it feel to be home joe
levlitt asked dreamily

all the pent-up rage went into joes
blow it caught levlitts chin and
reeled him into the wall he went down to
his knees the bartender yelled angrily
levlitt stared with stony contempt joe
looked at his fist he rubbed his hand
across his eyes suddenly he felt sick a
feeling of desolation went through him
dazedly he turned fumbled with the door
and went out he felt heavy and old and
terribly tired his eyes burned and blurred
damn them but the words too were
tired and empty

  it was nearly midnight when joe re-
turned to the marsden the street was
empty and still just within the darkened
entrance a man moved slightly seemed to
lean forward and peer at joes face

  corey he asked

  yeah the word was hostile so
what 

  if you can spare a minute

  for what

  lets take a walk in the park the
man kept his voice muted as his head
moved a reflection of light gleamed on
his thick glasses he was a short man
rather plump with an oval flat face you
wont be wasting your time he assured

  joe bent forward trying to recognize
him whats your name

  charlie come on corey i think youll
be interested

  joe hesitated there was something cu-

-fight-fall

riously compelling in the muted words
slowly he turned they walked together
across the street and into the darkness of
a patch of park

  ill talk you can stop me when youve
had enough the man named charlie said
first would it break your heart to win
that fight tomorrow night would you
mind having a few grand riding on your-
self at maybe five-to-one he paused and
sidled a sharp look at joe it could be
arranged it all depends on you corey
is dulaney for sale joe whispered
its a lot easier than that charlie
chuckled deeply itll take just about
three solid rights while youve got him
blindfolded

  i think youre a little crazy

  over a period of years i have dis-
proved that theory suppose you listen
his tongue moved over his lips with a
moist sucking sound my information
comes from one of dulaneys sparring
partners first he heard the story the
badkground later just by accident he
saw how this thing would work he tried
it again it worked again itll work to-
morrow night krebbles spotted it now
but its something that cant be smoothed
out in a few days see its like this   
his voice softened deliciously you let
dulaney come across with a left then-
straight up in the air with your left hand
see like this wild like-like you were
about to drive a knife down in his face
see it    then he does it covers up
like a kid about to get slapped he throws
his right arm over his eyes youve got
the whole lunch-hour to bust him thats
all there is see

  joe stared intently at the shadowy face
before him now i know youre crazy
the story the background giarlie
continued serenely it happened in
france dulaneys outfit was pinched off
in the battle of the bulge he was in this
hole by himself when a kraut climbed into
him with a bayonet hed been half-sleep-
ing for just a second dulaney saw this
blade coming down he tried to cover it
caught him just under the eye somehow
he nailed the guy then he passed out it
was cold he stayed there a long time he
thinks before they found him then he
fight stories



had fever nightmares when he kept see-
ing that arm upraised that blade coming
down you get it    he hasnt whipped
it he will sure but not by tomorrow
night something like that takes a long
time so   charlie cocked his head
alertly it takes somebody smart enough
to handle him a while then use this open-
ing you can do it and i can get five-
to-one on you

  joe swallowed his throat was dry he
flexed his fingers they were stiff the
whole thing its crazy he said thickly

  youll never know until you try it
charlie tilted his head again ive got
two thousand to bet for you itll bring
you ten all im waiting for is your word
i dont know the whole thing  i
want to think joe stammered

  thats okay tomorrow morning will
be soon enough you can call me at this
number    he handed joe a slip of
paper you know corey he said confi-
dentially you dont owe anybody a damn
thing they brought you in here to take
a beating they were looking for a soft

touch why should you-

  ill make up my mind without the sob
story charlie joe said abruptly i need
to think ill call you he turned and
walked back to the marsden

he tried to lie down to think about
it calmly a tense restlessness surged
through his veins he got up and paced
around the room

  now if it was like that just a flaw
like charlie said    sure if you spotted
an opening you worked it you always
did that that was okay sure so what
were you thinking about

  toe tried to understand there was
something tauntingly familiar about this
moment-as though he had lived it all at
some other time it was that time in pitts-
burgh but its not the same he said
aloud this is something different this
is his weakness its nothing ive done
what if things were turned around why

wouldnt he-

  his eyes found the crumpled newspaper
on the floor there was levlitts column
he could hear the taunting words again
how does it feel to be home joe

  he stood very still his fingers closing
into fists he felt the slow surge of fire
reach his cheeks and he heard the shrill
voice of the kid again

  they would be there tomorrow night
their hungry eyes upon him they hadnt
let him forget what did they care about
his pride

  if things were turned around  joe
thought of it again and his fingers cut
into his palms they wouldnt give a
damn he cried his heart pounded his
hands were wet he reached for the
telephone

  ten thousand dollars  it would be
the start a store a piece of land a
chance to get away no need for this again

  he gave the number one minute later
he replaced the receiver he turned and
stared around the room he felt cold he
had the strangest feeling-as if letty had
passed through this room and listened
the door was locked it was only a feel-
ing slowly he rubbed his head

  the lights were hot on joes bare
shoulders noise kept flooding down
from the crowded darkness of the stands
he shuffled around his corner flexing his
shoulders filling his lungs deeply his
stomach felt light and airy and a deep
richness of finality filled him this time
tonight    this was the last time

  the bell jerked at his nerves then ev-
erything seemed to slide into a measured
pattern he went out slowly to meet bar-
on dulaney dulaneys face was calm his
gold hair glistened his eyes were cool
and appraising there was a long pale
scar under his right eye

  he stung joe with a left crossed with
a right moved off and threw another left
joe drew a deep breath the physical con-
tact was strangely reassuring he went in
his massive shoulders bent his head
tucked in dulaney fed a left joe smashed
his lips with a looping right dulaney
backed away joe breathed hungrily this
was it this was everything his muscles
seemed to sing

  the round had been at least a draw
joe knew he breathed easily his arms
felt long and tough he saw charlie and
the little man winked then joe saw let-
ty she was three rows back and to his
homecoming



right she smiled and her lips formed
some silent word a momentary quiet
strayed through his brain the bell rang
again

  he followed dulaney found him with
lefts rocked him backward with long
rights he stalked him constantly as the
round wore away a growing exhilaration
filled his throat he could take this kid

  with half a minute left dulaney trapped
him the right seemed to explode between
joes teeth the ring rose and tilted in his
vision he went down and a great roar
swelled in his ears his legs felt numb
and flabby as he struggled up the bell
rang

  dorsey worked on him frantically joe
sucked fresh water as it ran down his lips
the stands pulsated with a hungry chant
get him get him joe stared at dula-
ney coldly the false exhilaration was
shattered his arms felt like wet pillows
he dragged in a deep breath as the bell
rang this time this round it would
have to be now he thought fixedly

  dulaney worked him along the ropes
with cruel jabs the blows were penetrat-
ing now joes lungs began to burn his
ribs ached he backed away licking his
lips watching waiting remembering
mid-way through the round the chance
came

  dulaney tossed over a left joe hesitated
an instant then hurled his left arm high
above his head with the motion he was
taunted by a sensation of utter folly then
it happened-so instantly and so incredibly
joe could scarcely realize an expression
of stark dismay splashed over dulaneys
face he jerked he stumbled clumsily
his right arm went over his eyes for
what seemed like an eternity to joe dula-
ney huddled before him joes muscles
coiled and kicked loose his right smashed
into dulaneys jaw and dulaney went
down

  a stunned roar broke from the crowd
dulaney huddled on the canvas staring at
joe with tortured eyes eyes that were
glazed with dull accusation the referee
was counting dulaney started up the
poise and calm had left his face

  between the rounds joes eyes met
sams their impact stung him the cold

third man out

     abe attell king of the little men some
   forty years ago once kayoed the referee of
   a bout in which he xvas participating then
   stood by while his opponent counted out
   the ref

     the year was  it was a hot july
  night and abe was battling willie beecher
  at arverne n y for two rounds the
  referee kept pestering abe for more action
  abe an obliging fellow stepped up the
  pace then in a flurry of infighting
  beecher moved his head and the ref re-
  ceived one of abes rights squarely on
  the nose he hit the canvas and beecher
  counted him out

fury of five years ago was rekindled in
sams face he knows joe thought queerly

  charlie was smiling softly joe looked at
letty she sat perfectly still her eyes
fixed on him with the strangest look of
wonder then so very slowly her eyes
moved toward charlie finally she looked
at sam she seemed to be searching for
some interpretation

  midway through the fourth round joe
caught dulaney again he threw up his
left grotesquely he hurled his right into
dulaneys mouth as dulaney huddled be-
fore him dulaney fell on his side and his
lips began to bleed joe walked away

  he saw charlie the fat face was radi-
ant charlie winked and nodded compla-
cently then joe saw letty her eyes
were fixed on charlie slowly they re-
solved themselves in his her face was
ashen her lips seemed to tremble abrupt-
ly she rose her eyes had found their an-
swer she stumbled toward the aisle
something tightened and snapped inside
joe his throat went dry her name tried
to reach his lips

  fight the referee commanded du-
laney was on his feet again letty van-
ished beyond the outskirts of light joe
turned to fight all his heart and urge
seemed to have walked away

  he sat in his corner and stared at her
empty seat all around was the ghosty sea
of faces a strange silence cloaked the
crowd something hard and ugly was
dawning into realization out there

it made joe cold and he looked at the
empty seat again the anguish of loneli-


fight stories

ness strangled him they hated him
and suddenly he hated himself this wasnt
the thing hed come back for suddenly in
those moments joe let himself think
clearly

  he hadnt wanted to walk unknown
down the hall he had hoped thered be
someone to meet him at the station in
some unspoken way he had hoped to find
something here he was so very tired
and hed wanted to come home this was
jhe last fight and he didnt want it this
way

  dorsey was pushing him yes the bell
had rung he went out his arms felt
like sacks of concrete his lungs burned
the mechanical part of his mind kept
prompting now this round this
round

  dulaney hit him again again joe
waited he hurled up his left a momen-
tary struggled stained dulaneys face as
he fought to control himself he lost he
stumbled and covered up there he wait-
ed there was his chin this was it

  the sob of anguished decision broke
from joes lips his right arm sagged to
his side he closed his eyes and shook his
head noise like the sharp rustle of leaves
swept through the crowd then joe looked
at dulaney the younger mans eyes were
wide incredulous joe hit him with a left
and the eternal instant was past dulaney
came in he slammed joe back he
worked him along the ropes he ham-
mered at joes ribs

  in the fifth joe was down he was
down twice in the sixth his lungs felt
like furnaces his knees shook each jab
seemed to grind his ribs deeper into raw
flesh the salt of blood coated his lips
the sixth    four more left four
more it was forever the end of forever
it was where he had to go

  the seventh down again the eighth
harder to make his knees carry him up
hard to see dulaney through the mist
no this was the referee joe shook his
head doggedly he was all right

  sams face swam through his vision
or was it sam    something had
happened to the eyes the face was gray
and sick was he smiling joe thought he

was smiling at him lettys seat was emp-
ty dulaney kept hitting him this was
the ninth round wasnt it the bell rang
in an instant it seemed it rang again

  you can make it dorsey had said
that joe went out to meet the white wraith
that was dulaney he threw his tired
fists out dulaney slugged him joe start-
ed down dragged himself up and bowed
his legs apart he ceased moving and
planted himself to stay

  the blows ceased to sting nothing
could hurt he was going to last the
terrible sweetness of the realization filled
his throat he wanted to laugh his lips
wouldnt move he did not hear the bell
he was alone in the center of the ring
he was still swinging when sam and the
referee pulled him back and there was an
endless thunder pouring out of the stands

  dorsey got him through the ropes his
eyes began to clear as they started up the
long aisle it was then and only then
that he realized they were shouting for
him too they reached out when he
passed this had not happened in a long
long time

  dorsey was tying joes shoelaces when
levlitt came into the silent dressing room
he walked over to joe and held out his
hand

  if you want to know he said it
was the biggest fight you ever won

  joe looked at him and understood what
he meant sam came in with dulaney
they shook hands and sam began to chew
his cigar ferociously

  i am glad joe he said he left it at
that i am wondering we will be need-
ing somebody with what you can
teach   

  joe did not hear the last words letty
had come in she was standing there with
a light shining in her eyes-a light so long
ago lost that joe could scarcely remember
it as pride she came toward him

  i waited on the ramp joe i had to
know this time she said softly

  joe looked at her without speaking he
thought of the things he needed to tell
her and yet as he kept looking at her
he realized there was no need at all they
both knew he had come home to stay
anhonestfight every night

by tom oneil

pugs knuckles was the diet of center city from hahes in diapers to
bearded giants rough and tumble was the order of the day but the greatest
show of all was still to come    staged by those impresarios of swat
roarin mike mcbride and little rinky sneed

center city was a fight town	crew partly irish partly welch the

on the south side beyond the bar-	north side was the exclusive property of

rier of the railroad tracks were	the steel workers from the mills hard-

the coal miners a brawling boisterous	jawed hunkies and harder-headed swedes




fight

stories

caught between these two in a kind of
squeeze were truck drivers railroad men
freight handlers factory hands eager to
fight to defend their right to live peace-
ably no holds barred every night was
fight night every street corner an arena
every cop a referee

  the professionals of course were the
elite

 a good lightweight was held in
higher esteem than a councilman and the
mayor wasnt in the same class with the
local heavyweight champ but-a success-
ful manager was king of them all

  but center city did not have a king
the town was divided into two armed
camps

  roaring mike mcbride full of bois-
terous hospitality and irish whiskey
with his st patricks arena was crown
prince of the south side graven in the
marble arch over his ticket window were
the words-an honest fight every night
and if you doubted it roaring mike
would fight you himself and that would
be an honest fight roaring mike sat-
isfied his customers

  and on the north side his rival was
little rinky sneed where mike impress-
ed you with the force of his personality
and muscle rinky sneed held office be-
cause he was smart he was smart from
the end of his pointed nose to the tips of
his pointed yellow shoes before rinky
had opened his emporium of swat he
called it that he had looked around him
and everywhere he had looked there was
another fight arena

  center city had arenas the way most
people had mice and that was where
rinky sneed showed his smartness his
emporium was not just another arena-
it was a lure for the jaded appetite a
feast for the blood-thirsty on alternate
days it was true you could see a straight
fight card but ah the other three days
rinky sneed had the kind of imagina-
tion that must have actuated such roman
spectacles as elephant versus rhinocerous
trident and net versus shield and sword
christian versus lion or even the burning
of rome itself rinky sneed was am-
bitious he wanted to be fight king of
center city

  pie did not have lions or elephants but
he did have the twelve man melee the
blind mans battle six gladiators blind-
folded the gory one-arm massacre in
which five men entered the- ring with one
arm tied behind their backs he insti-
tuted the novelty of two little men fight-
ing one big man he inaugurated the kan-
sas duel in which the fighters held either
end of a four-foot strip of innertube be-
tween their teeth the object being quite
obvious

  ah yes on such nights gore and teeth
rained on the canvas like tears from a
poets pen and none enjoyed it more than
rinky sneed himself rinky had the
tastes of a nero or a caligula imperial
tastes

  his first step toward the imperial
throne was the advent of young tom
cribb the classic clouter an immediately
popular innovation an innovation for this
day and age that is for young tom
fought under the old london prize-ring
rules of  under which anything was
permissible except the use of an axe
there was no time limit on rounds for
they ended only with a knockdown oh
it was really classic the gore-gluttons
loved it

  and to make it more interesting there
was a thousand dollars waiting for the
man who could beat the bejiminy out of
young tom all comers welcome that
was rinky sneeds first bid for the throne
of center city

ii

without fanfare of trumpet a
tall wavering figure lurched from
the rear entrance of the emporium he
staggered across the sidewalk caught at a
tree to steady himself then straightened
with visible effort and aimed himself at
the next tree head out-thrust legs wide
white patches of plaster criss-crossed his
lean face his eyes were all-but-sightless
slits in puffy flesh his lips a pair of blub-
bery doughnuts

  a small roadster leaped across the
street like a kangaroo with a hot-foot
screeched to a stop two feet over the curb
and a girl with a flaming mane of hair
an honest fight every night



like a crest of fire jumped from the door
and gathered the battered walker in her
young and tender arms

  dinny dinny she sobbed why did
you do it dinny why did you do it
she cupped his swollen face in trembling
hands

  he tilted back his head to see her be-
tween the slits of his swollen eyes and
the grimace that moved his lips was
meant for a grin

  it was a tough fight mom he said
as lightly as he could but i lost ill bet
i look it too

  oh dinny but why why dinny
for the thousand dollars my little
passion flower for the rest of the pay-
ment on that gas station or your old man
would never let me marry you and you
know it bless his heart of course he
added quickly for he knew how deep was
the love between nora mcbride and roar-
ing mike bless his homy heart

  oh dinny your poor face she
touched it with soft fingertips heres
my car

  it was the blind leading the blind for
her eyes were veiled with spilling tears
he sank into the seat beside her with an
ah-h-h of grateful muscles

  dad wont le home from the arena
until after midnight she told him im
taking you there to put something on your
lips  

  if you put on them what im thinking
theyd be well in a minute dinpy grin-
ned

  a cold compress she said severely
and stop your thinking thinking you
could fight that awful tom cribb got you
nothing but trouble

  i still think i can beat him nora
nobody can beat him she said with
conviction hes beaten hundreds of
men how many did he beat tonight
six he admitted reluctantly i was
the fourth but i blacked his eye for him
and gave him a cabbage ear that he can
cook with the corned beef i made of his
nose with the knowledge i gained to-
night ill stand a good chance the next
time 

  i cant see nora said primly that
youve gained anything but a face like

mulligan stew i dont want to hear any
more fight talk

across the city roaring mike mc-
bride was getting an earful of fight
talk and his guffaws rattled the loose
glass in the windows of his office in st
patricks arena and popped a button from
his vest just where the white piping came
to a v over his generous paunch across
the desk from him sat white-haired tim-
othy lord sports editor of the center
city news

  fight talk mike said lord smiling
as he tapped the proof of the advertise-
ment spread on the desk between them
what are you going to do about it
mike

  it was a full page ad mostly in bold-
face type

 for the classic champion-
ship of center city
come one-come all
i young tom cribb hereby challenge
all the bluffers and loud-mouths who have
been poking cowardly fun and otherwise
maliciously maligning my claim to the
classic crown to a

    fight to the finish
in the ring of rinky sneeds emporium
of szvat particularly i address this chal-
lenge to any fighter in the stable of roar-
ing mike mcbride the noisiest braggart
in seven wards

  john l sullivan once issued a chal-
lenge like that lord said reminiscently
and gentleman jim corbett beat the tar
out of him what are you going to do
about it mike

  me mike leaned back and roared
with laughter nothin timmy nothin
its beneath me thats what it is i
wouldnt send any of my boys against
thim clowns of rinky sneed twouldnt
be an honest fight like i pride meself on
giving twould be a massacree

  this young tom cribb is supposed to
be pretty good mike

  roaring make disposed of young tom
cribb with a flip of his massive hand an
acrobat he said contemptuously a ras-
sier still he thoughtfully stroked his


fight stories

rocky chin the taxpayers might start to
wonder a little if i let this challenge go
unnoticed now wouldnt they in fact
he said with decision i think ill send
sailor mcguire against the prancin ape
the next time he fights

  lord said calmly under an assumed
name sailor maguire fought young toni
three weeks ago and had his cauliflower
ears pinned back

  whisht ye say the avaricious bum
out after the thousand dollars no doubt
and me paying him a isteady living wage
and cribb beat him ye say no wonder
he suddenly up and wint to his grand-
mithers funeral he didnt have a face
to face me with this is serious the
sailor was a good fair-to-middlin fighter
maybe ill make it jimmy flannery a
very promising heavy

 timothy lord yawned oh promise
me he scoffed flannery looked like a
wilted orange blossom when young tom
got finished with him two weeks ago
wasnt it flannery who up and went to
his uncles wake in weehawken

  it was indade said roaring mike
grimly and i suppose yell be tellin
me next that me prime heavy larry
osullivan was took by this galloping
wonder ye wont be telling me that will
ye timmy he pleaded

  under the alias of battling sullivan
lord yawned last week in seven rounds
where is larry osullivan by the way
visitin his grandmithers aunt thats
got a pain in me fut said roaring mike
heavily

  he pushed himself up from his chair
and strode ponderously toward the door
he paused with his hand on the knob
and said im goin home to kiss me
shamrock tim and that aint for publi-
cation 

din ny keogh was lying on his
back on the living room sofa with
a cold compress on his ear when roar-
ing mike shambled in mumbling to him-
self nora sprang up from the sofa-side
and attempted to shield dinny from roar-
ing mikes gaze with her skirts but her
fathers glance was wandering and lack-
lustre

  from force of habit he muttered and
what did the cat drag in this time nora-
lass but his interest was faint his
eyes roved the room wheres me bot-
tle of auld bushmills coleen yer auld
man needs a drink

  nora sprang for the kitchen cupboard
while roaring mike sank into the hearth-
side lounge chair with a sigh ignoring
entirely the presence of dinny keogh he
cupped his heavy chin in his hands and
stared into space he scratched the back
of his neck pulled at his ear and his
eyes again encountered the supine figure
of dinny

  and who the livin hell are you he
demanded

  dinny said belligerently im dinny
keogh im going to marry your daugh-
ter and you might as well get used to the
idea

  mike stared at him awed whisht
young- feller-me-lad and what happened
to yer face he whispered

  a difference of opinion dinny grin-
ned a difference of opinion with tom
cribb he had the last word

  roaring mike continued to stare as if
hypnotized surely he faltered his
gloves were made of barbed wire with an
anvil concealed in either fist

  it was a fair fight and i lost

  he kicked ye whin ye were down didnt
he mike pleaded he kneed yer poor
weedin face and fouled ye in the clinches
surely 

  it was a fair fight dinny maintained
i made a mistake but   

  that ye did mike said gloomily
the mistake of fightin him in the first
place young tom cribb he mumbled
clenching his fists me very life is
haunted with young tom cribb twould
be better to call him young tom creep
im thinkin and the worst of it is i
niver clapped eyes on the blasted come-
dian how does he fight hey young fel-
ler  come on speak up speak up whats
that ye got in yer mouth anyways
theres nothing in my mouth dinny
mumbled thats my lips sticking out
how does he fight well its half wres-
tling and half boxing but i cant say i
remember a lot about it for after that
an honest fight every night	

  body slam he crashed me with in the first
round tilings became a little hazy i sort
of remember that he boxes like tunney
hits like louis and wrestles like jim lon-
dos kicks like a mule and dances like fred
astaire and as for the rest of it you
can liken him to the invisible man espe-
cially when youre trying to hang a right
hook on his jaw

  nora came in with a tray bearing a
bottle of irish whiskey and a beer glass
mike filled the glass and drained it at a
gulp

  he filled it again sawllowed twice
and the glass was empty he waved nora
and the tray away

  i know me capacity he said hmmm
thank ye young feller ye guv me a lead
on this young tom cribb sink his soul
also an idea and if its works out now
he cocked an eye made sunnier by the
irish whiskey ill look favorably on yer
suit for me daughters hand perviding ye
can support her in the style id like her to
become accustomed to now if yell ex-
cuse me and get the hell out of here   
dinny said quickly mr mcbride  
the word is scram if ye dont un-
derstand english

  but i  

  ah now have pity on me gray hairs
and spare me the pother of throwing you
out on yer ear i want to communicate
with meself and i can do it best alone
at a nod from nora dinny rose from
the sofa put the cold compress in roar-
ing mikes lap and departed but leaving
behind him the admonition youll wish
youd listened thats all i have to say
roaring mike said irritably wurra
wurra and communicated with himself

  the next day he took up rinky sneeds
challenge but obliquely anonymously for
he wasnt really ready yet all he wanted
to do now was prove that young tom
cribb could be beaten and for that pur-
pose he imported a wrestler from new
york called him the masked murderer
and the following friday sent him to chal-
lenge cribb in his own ring and in the
sight of all

  roaring mike was at ringside when the
murderer climbed into the ring he re-
laxed in his seat with a complacent grin

and smoothed his vest over his paunch

ill

in the grappling dens of nocturnal
new york the murderer was known
as klutski the clutch for his specialty
was to fasten himself around his oppon-
ents waist and tighten up notch by notch
no one had ever found out if his arms
would eventually have met in the middle
for the bout always ended when his op-
ponents innards met his tonsils

  but things began to go wrong immedi-
ately and rapidly became a mess the
masked murderer just wasnt bright-he
had forgotten to put on his mask for one
thing and for another he had forgotten
his lines and had to take a piece of paper
from his pocket and recite from it in a
hesitant and stilted voice and in the
third place roaring mike was just 
good as a showman at all he could give
the public an honest fight but he didnt
know enough about skullduggery to make
it palatable with nosegays and vaudeville

  rinky sneed on the other hand was a
past-master all dressed up like a beau
of the gay nineties in a flowered vest a
high crowned derby a fat cigar and a
pair of handlebar moustaches donned for
the occasion he held a short whispered
conversation with the murderer then led
the lumbering behemoth to the mike

  ladies and gentlemen he cried in a
high sarcastic voice i want you to lie very
hospitable to this little boy here because
hes a foreigner hes come all the way
from new york all by himself next
year he plans to vote give him a big
hand folks

  mike groaned the murderer was not
supposed to have mentioned new york
the crowd did not like imports and if it
became apparent that he had been hired
to come that would be a debacle an
outside manager could bring in a for-
eigner to fight a local boy but for a local
resident to do the same was treason

  the boos rolled down from the gal-
leries with thunderous volume and sud-
denly mike found himself on his feet
booing with the best of them

rinky sneed grinned thinly he knew
	fight

who had imported the murderer and he
gave mike a jeering foreboding glance

   now tell me he said putting his hand
on the murderers arm who brought
you here to fight young tom cribb a
local citizen

  mike held his breath theyd mob him
if it came out but stolidly the murderer
held up his paper to the light

   i-was-just-passing-through-on-the rail-

road-train he read jerkily like a sixth-
grader reciting the gettysburg address
i-like-center-city i-want-to-marry-and
and-settle-down-here i need-a-thousand-
dojlars to rent-an-apartment-and-buy-my-
girl-a-ring

   the crowd roared derisively any girl
whod have the murderer wouldnt be
wearing a ring a halter would be more
appropriate

  rut the murderer had sense enough to
stop there-or perhaps it was because he
had come to the end of his paper and
couldnt think of anything to say de-
spite rinky sneeds sly prodding to elicit
the name of roaring mike from his lips
all he did was stand an occasionally buq
onions onions always made him burp
in defeat rinky waved him to his corner
darting mike a venomous glance

  young tom cribb was ugly and hairy
-but the murderer was uglier and hair-
ier  pounds of it he sat squatly on
his stool scratched his belly and burped
again impervious to the hostility of the
crowd

   cribb sprang quickly from his stool at
the bell but the murderer came out slowly
shaking his hands a little as if the light
gloves bothered him he came out in the
wide-legged spread-armed crouch of a
professional wrestler

   cribb evaded his initial pawing grasp
and his hands licked out like striking
snakes the spat-spat was audible all over
the arena as the gloves landed meatily on
either side of the murderers jaw

   the murderers eyes flew wide in sur-
prise but he just pulled in his head a
little more deeply into his shoulders and
plodded forward weaving his pincer-like
arms cribb danced around the ends
of his gloves and hooked a hard right to
his ear sent in a straight left the

stories

murderer turned stolidly and followed
him across the ring hunching his shoul-
ders higher until his shaven bullet head
was almost buried in mountains of
muscle cribb was being careful very
careful staying out of range of those
clutching arms depending on his longer
reach to soften up the murderer for the
decisive later rounds

  the murderer gathered himself and
made a rush it was like the plunging
charge of a rhinoceros but cribb ducked
under his reaching arms and swung a
full-bodied left to the pit of the wres-
tlers stomach it was like beating a bass
drum he smashed a right to the jaw
a left to the mouth a right to the side of
his head and threw in three lightning left
jabs as he danced back and around to the
middle of the ring

   but it was as if he had been assaulting
a tank with a bean flipper for the blows
lost themselves in those layers of muscle
and the murderer plodded inexorably for-
ward ever forward

  cribb was sweating now it glistened
on every hair and ran down his ribs it
dripped from the ledges over his eyes and
pebbled his upper lip he was worried
his sunday punch had buried itself in
blubber and nothing had happened his
sharp cutting punches had no target in the
hard turret of that round shaven head

  cribb was not imaginative but he did
not like the jolts that jarred his shoulder
blades every time he conected solidly
he wanted to sit down and talk it over
with rinky sneed and get some advice
but there was no time limit on these
rounds one man or the other had to go
down before he could get back to his
corner

a  ringside roaring mike yell-
ed imploringly stay away from
him tommy-me-bhoy stay away from
him

  cribb showed his teeth in a wordless
snarl what the hell did pudgy think he
was trying to do sit in the murderers
lap and croon lullabies  he shot in a long
left and as he circled his foot slipped
for a frantic moment he floundered and
he felt the murderers arm slide asound
an honest fight every night



his waist he twisted found a hold and
with surging desperation threw the mur-
derer with a cross-buttock the judges
whistle screamed shrilly and the round
was over for the murderer had touched
knee and hand to the floor

  cribb sneered at the cheers that show-
ered him he had taken the round but
he knew how hollow had been that small
victory he was arm weary from punch-
ing and he had gotten no place the
murderer just sat phlegmatically on his
stool and burped onions and with
garlic it was the same always burps
the very thought of it made him burp he
shook his head irritably

  the thirty seconds ran out and the
fighters went to scratch for the second
round cribbs warning jab spat viciously
against the murderers head but too high
too high it was almost impossible to
find his buried chin from that range tak-
ing a chance he stepped in hooking with
rights and lefts he danced back be-
fore the murderers seeking hands could
circle him he grinned a little this
was better there could be more of this

  but rinky sneed his pointed face
pinched with worry gnawed at his cigar
and glanced malevolently across the ring
-but roaring mikes seat was empty he
had fled rinky grinned thinly tomor-
row hed fix mike tomorrow

  more confident now cribb circled the
ponderous murderer then darted in
shooting a right-but the murderer had
been lying in wait and as cribb came in
he brought up his linked hands and caught
him under the chin with a terrific sweeping
blow cribb had expected him to grapple
not strike cribbs legs flew up and he
crashed head and shoulders into the can-
vas the audience shuddered under a pro-
longed groan

  the murderer stared around disgusted
ly burped and tramped back to his stool
this was a hell of a way to rassle no
jumpings-on no kicks in the pusses no
grunts no groans he belched and the
stool creaked beneath him the next
round was the end he was tired of this
sissy stuff and he wanted to go home and
take a bicarbonate of soda

  as the dazed cribb was dragged to his

corner by his seconds roaring mike
came pounding down the aisle his collar
open his face purple his paunch heav-
ing from the exertion he galloped to
cribbs corner uncorking a small bottle
he thrust rinky sneed roughly aside
snarling

  ye want yer tramp to win doncha ye
under-sized dose of arsenic git outta
me way dabbling liquid from the bot-
tle on cribbs gloves he whispered
let him grapple with ye next round me
bhoy and whin he does shove yer gloves
under his fat snoot thats all ye gotta
do mind me words now

  sneed watched with beady eyes not at-
tempting to interfere if cribb lost now
he had his rival in a box a box filled
with the barbs and poison of scandal for
mike had no right in cribbs corner

  he said loudly leave the boy alone
mike and noted with satisfaction that
the reporters in the press row had heard
and were staring curiously that did it

  cribb went groggily to scratch at the
whistle groggily but grimly grapple
eh he eyed the murderers flat im-
passive features thered be some changes
made there before they got to grips he
chopped a stinging right and left to the
murderers nose and arched his back as
the wrestlers arms went around him the
murderer braced his legs and settled his
face against cribbs chest with a satis-
fied grunt he cross-locked his hands
and constricted for a terrifying mo-
ment cribb fought against that awful
pressure his ribs sprang and his eyes
stood out on stalks he beat against the
side of the murderers head with impo-
tent gloves

  mike roared under his snoot ye stu-
pid ape under his snoot

  the voice came faintly through the
sound of jagged cymbals that crashed in
cribbs brain and weakly he pushed his
gloves under the murderers nose the
response was instantaneous the murderer
jerked up his chin and sharply drew back
his head he strained away from the
gloves but cribb kept them glued to his
upper lip the murderers expression
changed from that of distaste to one of
horror and agony he turned green and


fight stories

finally releasing his lethal grasp stag-
gered back wiping furiousy at his nose
with his fore arm thunderous rum-
bling sounds came from his lips cribb
pursued him as fast as his shaking legs
would go the murderer covered his face
with crossed arms and retreated round
and round the ring he stumbled rum-
bling like a train in a tunnel cribb boxed
him into a corner and hammered pile-
driving rights and lefts into that agon-
ized face to the tilted shelf of the un-
protected chin the murderer looked
almost grateful as his knees crumbled and
he sank into unconsciousness signalled by
a monumental burp

  rinky sneed snatched the little bottle
from roaring mikes hand and snarled
what did you rub on cribbs gloves
his pointed nose dipped to the lip of the
bottle his features convulsed and he
thrust out the bottle at arms length
peeyoo he gasped garlic

  essence of garlic corrected mike
complacently poison for a bilious stom-
ach like the murderers poor lad

the next day rinky sneed brought
out another innovation in ballyhoo a
paid advertisement in the form of a two-
column sports gossip feature in the cen-
ter city news

at ringside
with
rinky sneed

  what prominent manager-promoter
he wrote sprang a ringer on young
tom cribb classic champion of center
city and got his comeuppance  five
dollars for each correct answer

  that was pure inspiration that five
dollar prize offer it was not so little
that folks wouldnt try for it and not so
much that sneed would go broke paying
it and pay it he did cheerfully for the
answers came rolling in it cost him
-but the name of roaring mike
was on every tongue and the name was
mud

  sneed let this situation ferment for
three days then put over the crusher in
his column

  are you all washed up roaring mike
mcbride he inquired isnt there one
real fighter in your stable of bums
your st patricks arena must be in a
bad way if you dont have even one boy
you can send against young tom you
must be cheating the public mike if
youre putting on a show without fighters
this is a challenge

  if i dont hear from you within one
week from date mike mcbride i will
proclaim young tom cribb undisputed
classic champion of center city

  how will it feel mike going back
to bricklaying 

that evening roaring mike held a
council of war in his office the
genial bloom had left his cheeks and
even his prosperous paunch had a dis-
couraged droop with him were sailor
maguire jimmy flannery and larry
osullivan his top-bracket heavies mike
leaned heavily on his desk and looked at
each of them in turn

  the sailor rasped dont look at me
mike i cant take the guy

  larry osullivan nodded and i aint
trained to fight his way he admitted
he gets me all mixed up why doncha
challenge him to fight our way

  mike spread his hands in a weary ges-
ture bhoys he said sadly i jist waited
too long i been out-witted theyd
laugh at me if i come out wit a challenge
now how about you jimmy flannery
ill take another shot at him if you
say so mike

  but ye dont have much hope is that
it

  flannery grimaced i cant get the
hang of trying to break a guys arms the
same time im punching him in the jsnoot
it dont come natural

  big mike slumped he raised his hand
and let it fall go home me bhoys he
said go home and water yer lawns and
if ye have money in the bank pay off
yer mortgages it looks like roaring
mike mcbrides going out of business
after they had gone he locked the office
and trudged out into the soft darkness of
the summer night the arena was closed
for the first week-night in its history but
an honest fight every night	

across town on the north side rinky
sneeds emporium of swat was jammed
to the eaves and the customers were fight-
ing on the sidewalk for the last few tick-
ets remaining it was tom cribbs last
come-one-come-all night for next week
he would be the crowned king of center
city

  mike trudged his lonely way homeward
his chin sunk on his breast his hands
sunk in his pockets this was the bitter
way of defeat this lonely road he had
never thought it would come like this
fighting-that was his way it hurt hav-
ing to slink off like this

  as he neared the flowering rhododen-
dron that bordered his modest cape cod
cottage a burly figure stepped from be-
hind the bushes and growled

  that you mike mcbride

  mike stopped he wasnt afraid but
his heart was hammering  tis meseif
he snapped pugnaciously

  but before he could draw his hands
from his pockets his assailant was upon
him a heavy fist crashed against his jaw
and he sagged to the sidewalk the thug
stood over him as he feebly tried to rise

  thatll teach you to bring in furri-
ners mike mcbride

  though the words were snarled they
were curiously empty of rancor and with
an intuitive flash of understanding mike
knew that this attack had been planned
by rinky sneed as a blow to his pride

  the screen door slammed and a lean
figure hurtled down the walk in a fly-
ing dive he plunged into the thug and
they rolled on the grass but only one
rose and the other lay jack-knifed and
writhing comforting hands helped mike
to his feet and noras young voice panted
did he hurt you dad

  mike ruefully rubbed his jaw
whisht he grumbled a mcbride
niver gits hurt with a sock in the snoot
but who is this cock o the world that
came lepping to me rescue now 

   thats dinny keogh the boy who   
aye said mike gloomily the bhoy
who made a mistake fighting young tom
cribb me curses on his hairy hide help
me in the house me bhoy these she-
nanigans kind of shook me up like

  between them nora and dinny helped
him into the living room and when nora
went for the whiskey bottle mike looked
critically at dinnys lean tanned face and
said politely

  im glad to see yer face is back to its
normal ugliness me bhoy but twas a
good lesson to keep yer nose out of other
peoples gloves

  dinny grinned it was a good lesson
he agreed but ill take him the next
time

  mike chuckled ye cant beat the
irish he said especially the thick irish
so theres goin to be a next time hey

  you bet there is

  well well now and what makes
ye such a fightin cock and all 

  because im going to marry your
daughter and i need the money to buy a
gas station i have fifteen hundred dol-
lars but i need another thousand

  mike listened thoughtfully its a
wonder bhoy ye are he observed yer
the only one that fut this cribb that wants
another dose ye think ye can beat him
surely 

  well dinnys chin went up he
wont take me by surprise this time im
in good condition i played football and
i can take care of myself ive got a
chance

  and a fightin heart too im thinkin
mike muttered its a good build ye got
-broad in the shoulder and lean in the
shanks and the courage to take on a man
bigger than yerself as ye just did out there
on the sidewalk he hooked his thumbs
in the armholes of his vest and said in a
suddenly business-like voice see here
young-feller-me-lad ill make ye a
proposition   

iv

the next day all center city was
electrified by the full page ad in the
news surmounted by the smiling picture
of jovial roaring mike mcbride himself

im calling your bluff
rinky sneed

  im taking up the challenge against
your grasshopper champion tom cribb


fight stories

and against him ill match the wonder
boy of the fistic world none other than
center citys own

dinny keogh
and though gamblings against the
law whos to know if i bet my st pat-
ricks arena against your run-down em-
porium of swat

put up or shut up rinky
sneed

  rinkey sneed sat in his office the pa-
per spread before him his ferret-bright
eyes darted from the bold print to tom
cribb who lay on the couch across the
room interested in pulling hairs from his
ears rinkys glance was calculating and
cold and there were dollar signs behind
it

  you didnt look so good last night
cribb he said sharply whats the mat-
ter getting old

 me boss i took on eight guys
didnt i

  in three and a half hours slipping
cribb looked abashed rinkys thin
metallic voice could do that to him aw
boss he mumbled i was juss kind of
showing off it was me lass night and
i was clowning it up

  if thats all okay but from now on
i dont want any monkey business did
you see this he tapped the spread of
mikes ad

  yeah lousy picture of mike aint
it a baboon haw haw

  shut up didnt you read it

  i was kind of busy at the time and-
aw hell who wants to read what that guy
says anyway

  rinky knew cribb couldnt read but he
liked to rub it in somehow though
this game didnt seem to have much
flavor

  keogh he said dinny keogh you
beat a guy by that name

  thats a fact boss four-five weeks
ago a young guy

  rinkys eyes narrowed the way they
always did when his sharp little mind
was searching for the joker in what
looked like an honest deal rinky had
plenty of experience with those jokers
suspiciously he reread the ad

  i dont get it he admitted sourly
hes putting up a monkey you already
beat and betting his arena against
mine

  cribb whistled and sat up say boss
he said brightly whatll my cut be

roaring mike mcbride was feeling
a lot less jovial than he looked as he
marched down the aisle before dinny
keogh and the honor guard of seconds
and handlers behind beneath his white
sweater his heart had butterflies and his
feet were quaking in their number fifteen
prisons

  hairy and slightly simian cribb was
already in the ring swapping jokes with
his admiring partizans and when dinny
climbed between the ropes he roared
boisterously

  well well if it aint me old punch-
ing bag dinny keogh i got a pair of
horseshoes you can put in your gloves if
you want

  dinny flushed but he showed a flash-
ing grin and waved his hand getting
old and flabby tom you offered me
anvils the last time

  he got a laugh for that and even cribb
grinned

  roaring mikes eyes were watchful and
appraising cribb was a half inch -shorter
than dinny but he was bulky and in com-
parison the boy was a peeled stripling six
feet one and lean as a bull whip he
didnt have the weight for a fight like this

  sneed called derisively across the ring
make it another five thousand mike
or are you a piker

  mike snarled make it ten and im-
mediately regretted his quick irish
tongue but it was done and he turned
to dinny showing a smiling confident
face

  the referee called the fighters to the
middle of the ring and gave them the
slightly bewildering instructions for these
were not the national sporting club rules
he patted them on the shoulders and sent
them back to their corners for the gong
this was all done in the fine old classic
style the referee was a deputy sheriff
and wore his star on his suspenders and
on his hip hung an ivory-handled six
an honest fight every night	

shooter hollywood could have used
rinky sneed for this bout he had in-
stalled a gong with a funereal knell

  it tolled and both fighters left their
stools fluidly and quickly dinny held his
hands as a boxer would-the left crooked
and out-thrust the right close to his jaw
and ready but scowling cribb came out
with a pantherish leap crouched low both
arms extended he looked wide open-a
delusion for cribb could move with light-
ning speed

  he feinted with his body to draw a
lead but dinny merely circled standing
straight-up watchful his hands bobbing a
little but poised and close offering no
handle for a flying mare or a body slam
he had been there before cribb grin-
ned narrowly and prowled around his
wary opponent feinting with both hands
now but dinnys eyes were on cribbs
feet he pivoted slowly refusing to be
drawn into a lead

  cribb straightened suddenly and threw
a long straight left dinnys right spat
out beating the punch and drew a trickle
of red from cribbs nose cribb bobbed
shot another left crouched and pointed
with a right that purposely missed and
offered his body for a left but dinny
grinned and winked for cribbs right
would have locked on dinnys wrist if he
tried for it and a fall would have fol-
lowed

  cribb scowled he had to force this
fight or lose the popular acclaim but this
monkey wouldnt be drawn cribb count-
ed on that first crushing fall he circled
lithely watching for that opening the
opening that would send his opponent to
the canvas with a bone wrenching crash
dinny keogh could hit that he knew
his cabbage ear was still a witness to the
fact he didnt want another

  he circled tigerishly waiting watch-
ing he was expert at this keogh
would make a mistake they always did
they werent trained to this kind of fight-
ing it took years-years and a blood-
thirsty louse like rjnky sneed to promote
it cribb had no illusions about rinky
sneed

  he padded patiently around dinny
shooting an occasional punch but waiting

always waiting he offered his chin for
dinnys right but dinny just waggled his
glove derisively he too was waiting

  the crowd was getting impatient and
as far as that goes so was cribb usu-
ally by this time he had the fight in his
pockct this wasnt running on schedule
a body slam he remembered a body slam
had done for keogh the last time hed
be watching for that give him the mare
with an arm-wrenching twist that was
the one the mare he circled until he
had dinny pivoting in the middle of the
ring then sprang   

  the breath went out of him with a
whoooosh and he went back across the
ring on his shoulder blades it was the
first time he had encountered the smash-
ing block of a hard-running fullback
dinny had caught him mid-stride with
shoulder and side the full weight of his
thrusting leg behind it cribb had never
played football that was obvious

  the judges whistle screamed as cribb
skidded into the ringpost his back look-
ed like what happens to your hip after a
reckless slide into third base

  rinky sneed hissed into his ear i
thought you took this tramp once before
snap it up ya bum or ill pin your ears
back

  cribbs isides heaved painfully next
round he panted hes got somethin
new

  white-faced nora sat at ringside
dinny had not wanted her to come but
there was too much riding on their fight
she fluttered her handkerchief and man-
aged a pallid grin when he winked down
at her as he walked to his corner

  roaring mike worked over him saying
joyfully ye got him dinny-bhoy ye
stopped him cold ye got him

  dinny shook his head he didnt have
him not yet and that block wouldnt
work a second time cribb was too smart
for that

the bell tolled at the end of the thir-
ty-second respite and the fighters
went to scratch the referee stepped back
and cribb jabbed with a snaky left fol-
lowed by a hard right to the side of the
head tried for the midsection but dinny


fight stories

countered with a right to the jaw and cir-
cled cribb bobbed and weaved and came
in hard hooking like a wounded bull
dinny stepped back and nailed him be-
tween nose and cheekbone with a driving
left

  cribb bled and shook his head and
dinny rocked him with a right and left
cribb grabbed for his wrist and turned to
throw him with a cross-buttock but din-
ny slammed into him with his full body
and chopped his face with sharp hooks
as he went back to the ropes

  roaring mike tore his sponge to bits
and rinky sneed shredded his cigar be-
tween his teeth

  the referee parted the fighters when
cribb clinched and held on cribb cir-
cled and fell back he dropped his
hands hitched up his trunks turned his
back on dinny took two steps away from
him then whirled and dived at him in a
hard-thrusting flying tackle this had
taken many a man by surprise but dinny
leaped toward him swaying his hips just
a fraction evading the grasp and shot out
a straight-arm as they crossed dinny
laughed as cribb pancaked face-down on
the canvas the whistle shrilled and
cribb dazed lurched to his feet

  roaring mike kneaded dinnys heaving
stomach and whispered and jist exactly
was that one dinny-bhoy i niver saw
the like of it in the whole o me life

  dinny said football and grinned
he relaxed his muscles under mikes
skillful hands

  it was cribb who came out slowly and
warily at the gong cast aside were his
wrestling tactics and he looked more like
a true fighting man as he shuffled from
his corner weaving and bobbing his
hands poised for a blow rather than a
grab he grinned this was what he
really liked that other stuff was okay
against the clowns rinky sneed had
matched him with but against a boy like
dinny a real stand-up fight was the thing

  he bobbed under dinnys reaching jab
and lanced in a straight left that took
dinny high on the forehead snapping his
head back drove in a right to the body
but took in return a slashing right and
left that rocked him to his heels this

monkey could punch he moved more
warily he bobbed feinting and grin-
ned as he sank a left to the heart but in
the next instant his grin was nailed to his
teeth by a crashing left he back-ped-
elled and the grin stayed where it was he
offered his chin and drove in under din-
nys right pumping short vicious hooks
to the stomach the heart the belly

  he had a chance then to throw dinny
with a cross-buttock but he just
crouched tighter and hammered away at
the midsection this was a fight now
dinny let himself be driven back to the
ropes then chopped twice for the side of
cribbs head and turned as cribb went
into the ropes from the force of his own
momentum dinny straightened him up
with a short right that had bone muscle
and sinew behind it it took cribb on the
side of the neck and sent him lurching
into the corner dinny followed relent-
lessly stabbing over the feeble defense
of cribbs raised arms

  he drove a left to the heart and as
cribbs arms came down he shot a
straight ramming right to the jaw cribb
toppled into him and he stepped back
raising his arms and cribb went to the
floor the judges whistle shrieked into
the pandemonium-there was no count
in this scrap-and dinny trotted to his
corner

  the seconds dragged cribb to his cor-
ner and rinky sneed his cigar cast aside
worked frantically over him

  cribb was able to stand at the bell
gamely but blindly he wavered to iscratch
and when the referee stepped back he
lurched at dinny still punching still try-
ing dinny caught him under the arm-
pits held him up and turned his head in
appeal to the referee cribb was still try-
ing to fight himself clear when his sec-
onds bore him to his stool

  roaring mike was dancing a come-all-
ye in the middle of the ring bellowing
he grabbed dinny hustled him out of the
clutch of the hysterical crowd and ran him
up the aisle to the dressing room where
nora was waiting grinning mike step-
ped back into the corridor and closed the
door he stood for a minute with his
tongue in his cheek then rubbed his
an honest fight every night	

horny hands together and went hunting
for rinky sneeds office

  rinky was huddled behind his fancy
desk when mike burst in with a roar

  rinky me bhoy he cried ill take it
kindly if yell git the hell outa me chair
and away from behind me desk

  rinky gave him a venomous glance but
slunk out of the chair roaring mike
dropped into it patted the padded arms
and looked around with an air of satis-
faction his nose wrinkled but there
was a twinkle in his eye he waved a
thick hand at the garish furnishings

  take a look at it will ye he mar-
velled its as fancy as a ladys front
parlor what we need in here rinky
me lad is more spitoons and fewer nakit
women on the walls therell be a few
changes made now that im sole owner
and proprietor

  rinky snarled wordlessly he dug into
his pocket for the keys to the emporium
of swat and furiously threw them across
the desk

  the interest on the mortgage he
said in a mean voice is due on the th
of every month

  roaring mikes eyes opened a little
ah a mortgage is it and just what is
the amount of this famous mortgage
thirty thousand dollars

  ye dont say said mike soberly ye
   dont    say

  and the contractor who put in the new
balcony last fall holds a corporation note
for fifteen thousand dollars

  the thievin robber mike gasped i
could of done the job meself for ten
and theres still seven thousand due
on the new air conditioning unit rinky
said derisively

  we- we- is there now it seems
to me that air comes a lot cheaper over
at me own st pats arena

  rinky hooked his thumbs in the arm-
holes of his vest im a little in arrears
with the taxes he purred but its noth-
ing that five thousand dollars wont clear
up

  roaring mike scratched his chin he
stole a quick glance at the gaudy office

-fight-fall

and winced he took a deep breath and
put on his most persuasive smile

  rinky me bhoy he said genially i
been thinkin it over if i went and took
this arena away from ye now why id be
in competition with meself and thats silly
on the face of it tell ye what ill  

  just a minute rinky jeered theres
something else i forgot to tell you the
mayor owns ten percent of the stock in the
emporium the police commissioner owns
another ten and the chief of police took
fifteen theyre your partners now

  not mine me bhoy yours

  not on your life bud this is your
arena

  oho is it now and did we sign pa-
pers 

  whatre you trying to do-welsh on
the bet mike this is your arena and
dont you forget it im taking the first
train out of town before the chief of
police the mayor and the police commis-
sioner crack down on me for non-payment
of taxes and other debts they were
threatening to throw me in jail but if you
put up the five thousand for the taxes i
guess theyll leave you alone for awhile
so long mike

  grinning he tipped his hand from his
forehead and strutted out of the office

  mike groaned wurra wurra and

poor jake

 by harold heljer

you can look up and down the annals of
the ring and you wont find a pugilist that
youll feel any more sorry for than one
jake kilrain following his -rounder with
jem smith the english champ

  if ever there was a guy who seemed to get the
hack of the hand despite the most commendable
determination and valor it was jake kilrain in
this fight to begin with he was outnumbered
originally there had been something like eight
americans in his party but four of them in wind-
ing their surreptitious way to a swampy island
in a marshy part of the seine river in france
where the illegal match was to be held got lost
thus of the  or so spectators who did get
there virtually all were englishmen deeply parti-
san in their sentiments and in their financial
wagers to the britisher jem smith

  the year was  when the boxing glove was
first beginning to be used in fact back in
america what fighting jake kilrain had done
always had been with gloves this was to be his
first bare knuckle encounter and also as a matter
of fact his first appearance in a professional
prize ring

  the englishmen consisting pretty much of the
nobility were quite certain that their man highly
touted the world over would waste little time and
experience no difficulty in finishing off the raw
lummox from across the waters

  but although smith landed a blow at the out-
set that closed one of kilrains eyes it became
evident quickly that the game american was going
to be far from a pushover and indeed that smith
was going to need all his ring lore and stamina to
survive

  as one of the chroniclers of the event reported
when kilrain came up for the next round there
was something in the expression of his good eye
that caused smiths seconds to warn him in
every round from the fourth through the th
kilrain knocked smith down at least once and
by the th round he had knocked him down more
than  times the last portion of the fight
seemed to follow just about the same pattern

  but while kilrain was doing plenty all right
against his ring opponent that is against one
specific one namely jem smith he was having
discomforting moments with smiths seconds in
particular a chappie named baldoch

  it seems that in those days if the two pugilistic
opponents got into a clinch they would wrestle
each other trying to break out of it and if both
men went down which frequently happened then
the seconds ran into the ring and brought their
man back to his corner well it seems that
smiths second baldoch would use his oppor-
tunity in the ring to do nefariously mischevious
things to kilrain

  at the end of the nd round went an ac-
count of the fight kilrain staggered to his feet
half blinded mr atkinson he addressed the
referee that man baldoch rammed his finger
into my eye as i lay there and tried to gouge it

out you can see for yourself

  his left eye was streaming with blood the
right eye had been closed for an hour the
wound in the eye was on the lower lid where
the nails of smith apparently not a paragon of
gentlemanly attributes either had dug into it
fortunately he had not succeeded in piercing the
eyeball atkinson reproved baldoch

  but reproof or not it appeared baldoch could
not be contained from his rather underhanded
practices at one juncture charley mitchell
kilrains handler leaped into the ring and cried
out you dare not maltreat my man  blush
to acknowledge that you are englishmen heres
a lad who has come three thousand miles over-
seas to fight your champion he never even saw
a prize fight before he has no friends here
while theres one hundred against him hes
going to have his right or ive got to get licked
as well as he

  even this stirring declaration did not deter the
determined baldoch and at the end of the th
round while in the ring supposedly to pick up
his gladiator was seen trying to break a finger
of kilrain this was too much for mitchell and
he jumped into the ring and took a swing at
baldoch knocking him out of the ropes baldoch
got back in and the two seconds went at it ham-
mer and tong threatening to eclipse in fierceness
the main event but ringsiders finally brought it
to a halt

  as the fight passed the -round mark there
was no doubt that from one quarter and another
the american had absorbed quite a bit of punish-
ment kilrains right eye was puffed like a
miniature balloon a journalist wrote his
left eye could open itself only partially his jaw
looked like a piece of raw beefsteak and there
were bumps on his forehead the size of eggs
a continual stream of blood flowed from his
right car where it was torn there were blood
smears all over his body although it was kept
continually sponged

  but although smith only had one opponent in
the ring to contend with the journalist went on to
say that the englishmans appearance was even
worse indicating very strongly that kilrain had
got much the better of the embroglio in the
th round kilrain knocked smith down again
and the britisher seemed to have trouble getting
up but the fight was stopped and called a draw
because of darkness

  a heartbreaking denouement for jake kilrain
it goes without saying and a rather strange fight
all the way around but perhaps the most curious
part of it was the presence at the ring of a
rather small englishman with patches of hair
at his cheekbones he was the marquis of qucens-
bury the man who was to set down our modern
civilized rules for pugilistic ring behavior and
what was the marquis reaction to all this skull-
duggery and mayhem on behalf of his compatriot
prizefighter he wandered socially about it

 murder the bum mason yelled at adele
mcnear fumed

the title was the least these two men
were fighting for there was a brown-
haired honey who had em both sizzling
before the bell ever rang

old tom johnson looked up
at the man standing in the door-
way the man was a fighter tom
could tell that by looking at his face it
had been a good-looking face once but
now it was marked too much the man
was still youthful but something had aged
him

  old tom grunted it was his way of
greeting

 tom johnson

 old tom grunted again looking up
 sourly at the man

 fin jimmy mcnear

 old tom grunted the third time the
 name didnt mean anything to him too
 many men came to his gym office every
 day

manager the man seemed undaunted
by old toms cold attitude he stood in
the doorway easily steadily regarding the
well known manager

  whodjaeverfight it almost sounded
like a fourth grunt

  solly mason seventy-three times

  old toms head snapped up and his
eyes came open he didnt say anything
and his face held a question

 jimmy mcnear smiled faintly we
did a series of exhibitions overseas right

after the european war closed-a long

series

  old toms head slowly sank again and
his eyes lidded he was unimpressed

  i learned a lot in those fights said
the man a little grimly

   whereyabeensince 

  out on the west coast i met some
pretty good boys out there and beat them
havent lost a fight since my discharge
howdjahappentopickme 

  had an old trainer and sort of manager
on the coast he told me to look you up
if i ever came east name is ziggy
peters

  ziggy old toms feet came off the
desk and his face turned up alert and
smiling how is the old fathead he
forgot his role and the words were under-
standable

 fine said jimmy getting old
though figured he was too old to keep
climbing in and out of rings and getting
all excited

  old why ill say he must be old
he was old when i first started in this
racket old tom shook his head slowly
thinking back ill say he must be old
he told you to look me up

  thats right

  old tom remembered his role again
and subsided a little he hooked his
thumbs in his vest and looked the fighter
up and down so you want some fights
well i can get them for you if youre
any good ziggy probably wouldnt fool
with you unless you were

  im good-now said jimmy grim-
ness returning to his voice

  old tom squinted at him middle-
weight 

  right

  solly masons still champ you know
  i know

  okay come with me

  old tom took jimmy back to the locker
room and scooped out the bottom of a
locker throwing aside an old towel sweat-
shirt and one shoe take this one he
said you got duds

  jimmy nodded at the bag he was carry-
ing

  okay get dressed and come out to the
ring ill line something up

  jimmy slipped into the ring a few min-
utes later he was dressed in a pair of
old trunks and tom noticed the ripple to
his muscled back and the good slope to
his shoulders while tom was putting a
pair of heavy gloves on him jim looked
across at his opponent he was only about
twenty and danced in his corner sticking
his mouthpiece in and out and blowing
through his nose the way he thought a
fighter should jimmy grinned to himself

  okay tom shouted go to it he
stepped aside and let the two fighters come
together

  jimmy fought upright moved in on his
toes but didnt dance and waste energy
he watched his opponent closely

  the kid came dancing in with a great
deal of flourish he lashed out with a
long left and jimmy picked it off easily
jimmy stepped in close to draw a punch
and the kid swung a savage right-hand
haymaker jimmy rolled and leaned back
just a little the right flashed past in
front of his nose and jimmy was immedi-
ately alert for the left-hand follow but
it didnt come the kid having missed
was far off balance and wide open jimmy
grinned and crossed with a left pulling the
punch as he tapped the kid on the chin

  the kid straightened up and drove at
jimmy furiously hitting with left and
right and pounding with everything he
had jimmy had a rough time for a mo-
ment but managed to tie the kid up with
both of them unscathed

the kid bounced back energetically
swarming in and jimmy saw that
the kid had orders to kill his opponent if
he could he didnt want to cut the kid
up and hated to hurt him but a good
the lady likes blood	

clean knockout was the only solution un-
less he wanted to fool around until the
kid tagged him with one of those wild
swings

  jimmy blocked a right and drove his
own right hard to the pit of the stomach
then he crossed his left expertly to the
jaw and hooked his right to the other
side of the jaw the kid sprawled out
across the canvas

  jimmy spit his mouthpiece into his glove
and looked at old tom that was a
mighty poor piece of try-out you gave me
he said

 old tom shrugged why should i
throw one of my good boys at you and
ruin his confidence as a matter of fact
i dont have anything very good right now
besides how did i know you were gonna
pull your punches and tap around you
said youd been trained by solly mason
jimmys face froze i said i had some

exhibitions with him in the army-

didnt say he trained me

  uh-huh said old tom did solly
ever pull a punch

  sure said jimmy when he wanted
to cut me up

  old tom wisely refrained from any
more questions okay he said ill get
you some fights you can use that locker
and train here a lot of the good boys

train here at times-even solly mason

  old tom got jimmy fights all right and
jimmy took them on in business-like
fashion jimmy always gave the customers
a good show he had a knockout wallop
in either hand and he bowled over the men
he met within a year jimmys name be-
came known in the east

  old tom stopped him at the gym one
day say he said solly masons going
to train here for the jenkins fight hes
looking for good sparring partners you
interested 

  no said jimmy

  he pays pretty good money to his
sparring partners said tom

  he should said jimmy shortly and
he walked away

  solly mason came in to train every
afternoon belting kids around the ring
punching them silly even with the heavy
gloves to solly fighting was a joy he

was a born killer and liked to punch a
man around to jimmy it was a business
and he set about to win a fight in the
easiest possible manner for both him and
his opponent he didnt have the color
of solly mason but old tom recognized
in him already a possible challenger for
masons crown

  jimmy deliberately avoided the loud-
mouthed champion he fooled with the
bags in the morning and did a little spar-
ring trying to teach old toms kids some-
thing then quit about the time solly was
due he hid in the showers under a
cascade of water while solly dressed and
came out when the champion had gone into
the gym then jimmy dressed and left

  about a week after solly went into
training jimmy was leaving and stopped
in a corner a moment to watch solly
across the gym pummel a sparring part-
ner even with the heavy gloves solly
was giving the kid a bad time and had
him a little groggy jimmy turned away
a little sick with the remembrance of
seventy-three times he had gone through
the same thing with solly but with fight-
ing gloves exhibitions exhibitions of
how solly mason could knock a man out
or cut him up or beat him groggy but
jimmy had been in the army and his orders
were to climb in the ring and fight solly
mason whenever an exhibition was sched-
uled

  jimmy opened the door and almost ran
down a girl standing there she must have
been peeking in the window and jimmy
preoccupied had bumped her head knock-
ing her silly hat askew

  im sorry he said grabbing her by
the elbows to keep her from falling i
didnt see you

  thats all right she gave him a smile
and jimmys heart did three quick nip-ups
she was peaches and cream jimmy
couldnt tear himself away

  can i help you with anything he
asked eagerly

  possibly you can she said straighten-
ing the hat on her rich brown hair her
face was classic except for a nose that
was just a little too snubbed and to jimmy
she was the prettiest thing hed ever seen
im looking for solly mason


fight stories

  jimmys heart did a quick dive into the
pit of his stomach oh no he said

  she looked surprised oh yes i am
whats so surprising about that

  well said jimmy still not believing

it just- mean you dont look-

he stumbled thinking of the type of girl

solly usually dated-and he still didnt

believe it the girl was nice she was-

nice

  then a sudden thought came to him
what did you want to see him about
his voice was hopeful looking for ail
easy explanation

  her surprise deepened dont you
think thats my business

  well sure i just meant- mean

i thought maybe i could help you
you can if youll tell mr mason im
here i shall be grateful my business with
him is personal

  oh jimmys face hardened thank
you ill tell him he turned away and
strode across the gym to where solly was
resting until another partner was ready
for him jimmys mind was so busy and
he was so angry that he was halfway
across the gym before he remembered that
he was going to talk to solly mason his
stride faltered and he almost stopped

  solly mason a hard cold lump formed
in his throat at the thought of sollys ugly
face leering at him across a pair of gloves
he was tired so tired and his face was
bleeding from cuts that didnt have time
to heal between bouts the doughboys
were hollering and he tried to get his
guard in the right place but solly kept
smashing it aside and flicking those gloves
into his bloody face jimmy couldnt lay
down and quit in front of all these gis
but his legs were rubbery and his arms
heavy and solly just danced around
flicking and cutting and making himself
look good instead of delivering the coup
de grace and ending it all

jimmy shook his head to clear it and
found that he was at ringside he
heard sollys hoarse rough voice and
looked up

  jimmy solly yelled he threw his
head back and guffawed well ill be a
wooden saw-horse if it isnt old jimmy

  hi sol said jimmy

  say said solly youre just the man
im looking for i need a good sparring
partner come on ill fix you up in some
togs and you can show these bums how
to take it

  no thanks said jimmy coldly im
not in the army now i dont have to get
in there and let you show off

  solly allowed surprise in exaggerated
proportion to cross his face let me
he guffawed again dont take it to
heart jimmy besides it seems to me
you used to fight back now and then and

i	had to give you a lesson solly let his
raucous laugh peal out again

  sure he had fought back before he got
too tired before the tricks and pounding
of solly wore him down he had been
no match for the experience and ability
of the older man

  you gotta admit jimmy you learned
when you were fighting the champion

  sure said jimmy i learned a lot of
things he had at that the last eight
or nine exhibitions he had been giving the
champion a rough time he tagged the
champ every now and then and once he
had nearly put the great solly mason on
the ropes but solly had what it took and
he always came back to lace jimmy un-
mercifully in the later rounds it never
paid to fight back although jimmy always
did

  watcha doing jimmy still fighting
solly was curious about this fighter who
had never quit during seventy-three beat-
ings

  yeah said jimmy im still fighting
then he remembered why he had come
over just came to tell you that theres a
girl at the door waiting for you he
indicated the girl and watched solly
closely solly looked over and his chest
puffed up he had always been proud of
his women this one he could afford to
be proud of a leer came to sollys face

  she the current rage jimmy was
goaded into the question by something he
couldnt understand

  solly looked down at him and guffawed
sure jimmy you know how i was with
the women he waved his glove and
shouted across the gym hiya honey
the lady likes blood



come on over

  that was enough for jimmy he turned
away and started back across the gym
he met the girl halfway and she didnt
look as though she were advancing eagerly
to meet a lover

  thank you she said coldly to jimmy

  jimmy stopped doggedly and regarded
her she stopped too uncertain jimmy
looked at her well-dressed figure looked
into her clear hazel eyes and shook his
head no sir he said

  i beg your pardon

  no sir you dont look like the kind
of girl that would fall for a lout like solly
mason jimmys eyes were cold and
hostile

  her eyes widened in surprise for a
moment and then anger swept across her
face she turned on her heel and walked
toward solly mason

  about two days before the jenkins fight
jimmy found out who the girl was the
papers were full of pictures of her pic-
tures of solly mason the middleweight
champion and of the two together she
was adele lemuir an actress who seemed
to be a champion in her own field al-
though jimmy didnt care much for the
name and she announced her engagement
to solly she was opening a new show
on broadway the night after the jenkins
fight

  solly announced to the world that
he would be there win lose or draw
against jenkins she would be at ringside
to cheer mason on

  jimmy attended the fight she was not
only there but climbed into the ring and
was introduced to the cheering crowd as
the champions fiancee who is opening a
new show on the great white way tomor-
row night

  jimmy prayed fervently that jenkins
would knock sollys head off but he
didnt jenkins was a rough tough slugger
made to order for solly solly was a
stand-up fighter who cut jenkins to pieces
as the hitter tried to get in close jimmy
had to admire the way sollys feet were
always in position to hit a solid blow with
either hand the lightning way sollys
hands moved to block and hit the ring
generalship of the man he knocked

jenkins out in the sixth he was a cham-
pion all right

  the next week old torn called jimmy
into the office jimmy he said we got
a chance for a big fight

  so

  we can take jenkins on in the main
event at the garden two months from
now

  jimmy was surprised how come
old tom shrugged youve built a
good reputation since youve been here
your record from the coast is good they
want to build jenkins back up for another
shot at masons title

  it was jimmys turn to shrug okay
ill take him on

  old toms eyes narrowed you realize
dont you that they figure jenkins can
beat you or they wouldnt make the
match 

  jimmy stood up that goes two ways
i think i can beat him too

  so do i said old tom

  this surprised jimmy why

  well said tom did you notice how
he was kind of made to order for solly
yes

  did you ever figure out that you fight
a great deal like solly mason you dont
fight a man seventy-three times while
youre learning without picking up some-
thing

jimmy looked down at his closed fist
i dont force a fight the way solly does
no you counter-punch more thats
why i figure youll beat him when you
meet

 when we meet

  old tom shook his head wisely its
going to happen jimmy

  jimmy snorted not unless its an ex-
hibition he said he walked out on old
tom that cold lump of lead back in his
stomach

ii

jimmy stood in his corner waiting for
the bell he looked across the ring at
the husky gnarled figure of jenkins and
a million thoughts raced through his mind
this man was fighting for another shot
at solly mason if jimmy let him win
	fight

jimmy would never have to fight mason
again

  then the bell rang and jimmy was out
with the crowd yelling he moved warily
keeping his feet in position watching the
older man come in alert for the opening
blow

  jenkins just plodded in and started
swinging jimmy picked off and countered
then retreated picked off countered and
retreated he moved out of a corner and
stopped to beat jenkins in the head taking
a few blows to the body that didnt carry
too much sting with surprise jimmy real-
ized that jenkins was no longer a fighter

he was too old washed up-he shouldnt

even be in the ring jimmy could hit him
at will

  so thats the kind of stuff solly was
holding his title against jimmy thought
jimmy had met several promising young
middleweights that could do better than
jenkins and had beat them

  at the end of the first round jimmy
came back to his corner breathing easily
and unmarked

  youre doing fine said tom as they
sponged him off just keep moving and
picking off youre way ahead of him
dont let him get in close and youve got
nothing to worry about

  sure jimmy thought stay away and cut
him up just like solly mason wear him
down and then knock him out make it
look good

  tom said jimmy how many rounds
did it take mason to knock out this pa-
looka 

  six

  well im going to do it in two

  jimmy was out at the bell and walked
across the ring to meet jenkins instead
of moving away jimmy closed in and
beat the older man to the punch he
blasted a right hand to the face and hooked
a left deep in jenkins stomach jenkins
countered to the body and jimmy hooked
a savage right that caught jenkins right
on the button jenkins eyes glazed over
and he reached for a clinch jimmy stepped
outside the arms and threw a long left
over the top of them to the head the
crowd was sensing the kill and were on
their feet screaming

stories

  jimmy moved inside again put the left
to the body and hooked the right to the
jaw jenkins knees buckled and he held
on the referee separated them jimmy
went right back in and hooked the left
to the head then he brought a right
hand up that had behind it every bit of
timing and every ounce of weight that
jimmy owned jimmy twisted his body
into it and it snapped jenkins head back
savagely

  jenkins went back into the ropes and
then slowly dropped to his knees he
reached automatically behind him for the
ropes missed and fell forward on his
face he lay still while the referee counted
him out

jimmy stretched out on the davenport
in his small bachelors diggings and
read the papers usually his wins were
just in with the fight results sometimes
he got a write-up but this time he had
headlines on the sports pages his knock-
out of jenkins was described variously as
unexpected thrilling savage and
an upset jenkins said after the fight
that it was the hardest he had ever been
hit the papers named him as the next
man to meet solly mason

  jimmy frowned if there was one man
his knockout wouldnt fool it was mason
mason had just fought jenkins he knew
how impotent that older mans blows had
become how slow he was how easy it was
to knock out jenkins it wouldnt fool
solly

  apparently it didnt fool solly and the
champion still considered jimmy a set-up
seventy-three times he had his way with
jimmy thats a habit hard to break sollys
manager announced the next day that he
was willing to meet jimmy old tom
called jimmy to his office

  well said old tom indicating a
sheaf of newspapers on his desk mason
wasnt kidding the press i had a call
from his manager

  jimmy was silent

  what do you think tom asked

  jimmy shifted his weight jenkins was
washed up he said solly knew that
im not as good as i looked against
jenkins-solly knows that
the lady likes blood	

  maybe not but neither is solly then

  solly sees a good gate and an easy
win said jimmy bitterly

  it wont be so easy if he does win
said old tom

 do you think im ready it was
jimmy who was uncertain this time

  how old are you now

  twenty-six

  if youre not ready now you never

will be you should be at your peak-

and maybe four more years then you
start slipping down

  masons twenty-nine said jimmy
hes still a good fighter

  sure agreed old tom

  maybe i better not fight him said
jimmy

  tom looked jimmy up and down slowly
jimmy was ashamed of his cowardice but
driven by it nevertheless he could feel
the blood stinging seventy-three different
cuts on his face now

  no guts old toms two distinct
words dropped into the stillness of the
office like gun shots on a quiet fall morn-
ing

  jimmys face jerked up and anger anger
to hide the shame convulsed it jimmy
helped to his feet no guts thats right
i got no guts to fight mason but go
ahead sign me up ill fight him jimmy
leaned across the desk and pounded it
go ahead ill fight him sign me up
jimmy turned and left the office the quiet
accusing eyes of old tom following him
down the stairs and into the street jimmy
jammed his hands into his trouser pockets
and walked

  he walked without direction or aim
his mind a tumult the hurrying crowds
around him unheeded until suddenly he
was face to face with a life-sized picture
of adele lemuir he looked around and
saw that he was standing in front of the
theatre where her show was playing

  the girl had often been in jimmys
thoughts since that day he met her at the
gym now almost without thinking he
pulled a bill out of his pocket and went
to the ticket window there was a matinee
and he purchased a seat in the front row

  jimmy sat among the scattered patrons
at the afternoon performance and watched

her slim beauty and grace as she performed
her part it was a comedy and the people
about jimmy laughed heartily at different
times but jimmy glowered through the
entire show hearing none of the words
his eyes fastened on each movement of
her face remembering the clean cut lines
and hazel eyes of the girl jimmy drank
his fill and when it was over he rose to
leave

to his surprise an usher stopped him
as he reached the aisle the usher
handed jimmy a small folded and deli-
cately perfumed piece of paper jimmy
opened the paper and there was a note
penned hurriedly

  please see me after the show the
usher will lead you backstage it was
signed adele

  jimmy was more than surprised he was
amazed he would have bet money that
if he had met adele lemuir in the street
she wouldnt recognize him and he hadnt
noticed that she had paid any attention to
the audience yet she had apparently seen
him there and had written him that note
jimmy meekly followed the usher

  he was led through the confusion back-
stage to a door with the traditional star
on it the usher knocked and jimmy
heard adele call out the usher opened
the door and jimmy went in

  it was a very lovely room obviously a
dressing room adele sat in front of a
huge mirrored dressing table she was
wearing a fluffy dressing robe that covered
her from throat to ankles

  hello she said to jimmy sit down

  he sat and she smiled at him with great
enjoyment

  whats so funny he asked sourly

  you she said i dont think i ever
saw anyone get as little enjoyment from
a performance i dont think you smiled
once

  you were watching me he was in-
credulous

  intently she said if everybodys
reaction was like yours the show would
have closed its first day

  i was getting my enjoyment another
way said jimmy thawing a little and
giving in to the joke on him


fight stories

indeed what way was that
watching you he said and then
wished he hadnt

she dropped her eyes but then returned
her gaze to his with the same mocking
smile even though im engaged to
solly mason

jimmy shook his head slowly the frown
returning to his face thats something
ill never understand

thats why i asked you to come here
she said the smile leaving her face to
explain

to explain to me the surprises
since jimmy had entered this theatre were
piling up on him why

she hesitated before answering and her
eyes were steadily on his i dont know

-do you

he held her eyes a long moment yes
maybe i do maybe the same reason i
came here this afternoon

 there was a silence as they both digested
 this then she laughed quickly and turned
 away to her mirror picking up a brush
 and smoothing her hair

it was a publicity stunt the engage-
ment our press agents cooked it up our
show was opening the next night and they
figured it would help the box office for
both the fight and the show

did it

 it did for the show it isnt a particu-
 larly good show yet weve had a decent
 rim i think well close sometime next
 month

do you think it was worth it

she stopped combing her hair arent
there some things necessary to your pro-
fession that you dont care for

yes

well then

okay jimmy shrugged his shoulders
i guess youre right i just couldnt
figure it out then youre not going to
marry him

she shuddered perish the thought

hes-hes very coarse i had to go out

with him a few times with plenty of
photographers around

im glad you agree with me

she turned to face him again i do
however i probably wouldnt have
minded it so much if you a complete

stranger hadnt been so outspoken it

kept worrying me-and when i saw you

in the audience today i had to tell you
once again their gazes locked in a long
moment of silence

  where are you eating tonight jimmy
asked suddenly

  wherever you are she answered gaily
its a deal jimmy said and solly
mason was forgotten

  the next morning jimmy called tom
on the phone have you signed that
solly mason fight yet

  no

  do it this morning

 what

  do it this morning

  old toms voice became joyous thats
the boy jimmy i knew youd do it boy
i knew youd fight him ill call right
away jimmy boy

  the fight was scheduled for january
st in the garden mason had insisted
upon waiting until january for income tax
reasons by that time adele was rehears-
ing a new play and jimmy saw her as fre-
quently as training allowed him

  one night a gossip columnist saw them
together the next day he ran a query
as to why solly masons fiancee was going
out with his next opponent

  solly called adele and complained she
told him they should publicly call off their
engagement and that was the next story
to hit the papers the sports writers be-
gan to bill it as a grudge fight because
of the pretty actress the stories made
liberal mention of her next show and
called her the fighters lady

  jimmy didnt care for any of this it
seemed to him that her whole life was a
sham just like a role in one of her

plays even her name was false-adele

lemuir was something her press agent
had dreamed up but adele was genuine
and when he was with her jimmy forgot
the other things

  january st approached and jimmys
training became intense he was worried
he was worried not because of the fight
or because he might lose he was worried
bccause he knew that he had a physical
fear of mason he knew it was unreason-
able that he was a much better fighter
the lady likes blood



than when he was in the army but he
couldnt control the reaction he had had
night after night when he climbed into the
ring against the champion it was too
much for him

  on new years morning jimmy was up
early after a restless night he had risen
at midnight to lean out the window and
watch new york welcome the new year
he had slept little after that the nights
fight revolving in his mind

  he picked up the morning papers and
turned nervously to the sports page there
was a huge picture of adele standing on
a night club table a glass of champagne
in her hand new years eve revelers all
around her announcing that solly mason
and jimmy mcnear were fighting for her
hand that night that she went to the
winner the caption said fighters
lady says winner take all of me
then there was a mention of her new
show opening the next night

  jimmy went to the phone and snatched
it up gripping the receiver until his
knuckles were white then he slammed it
back down without calling her he had
been on a merry-go-round ever since he
met her she always protested her inno-
cence but that stuff wouldnt come out
without her consent and look at the
picture she must have been at the
night club

  he picked up another paper and there
was the same picture from a different
angle her skirts were raised high to
show her beautiful legs

  later in the morning the phone rang
but jimmy ignored it jamming on his
hat and leaving the apartment she would
say she had nothing to do with it

  he was at the gym when one of the
trainers yelled at him that some dame
wanted him on the phone

  tell her i never talk to anyone on a
fight day said jimmy tightly tell her
my press agent doesnt like it

  huh

  jimmy waved a hand at the trainer
tell her the trainer shrugged his
shoulders and went back to the phone a
little later he reported

  this dame says to tell you shes sorry

  thats tough said jimmy closing his

mind to the thought of hurting adele

ill

jimmy climbed woodenly into the ring
that night he could already feel the
rapier fists of solly mason cutting him
down and he didnt much care whether
he won or lost he knew from long ex-
perience how fast mason could feint and

hit-how hard mason could hit and how

it felt when things suddenly blanked out
and you came to a few seconds later in
an awkward position on the floor with no
idea of how you got there

then suddenly adele was on the ring
steps and had hold of jimmys arm
jimmy she said jimmy youve got
to listen to me

jimmy looked at her and saw she was
close to tears

he didnt say anything

jimmy that picture was faked

a photographer had seen them and a
flashbulb burst

that one wasnt said jimmy theres
another thousand dollars worth of publicity
and another week for your show

jimmy dont they have hundreds of
pictures of me in different poses they

dubbed in that background-dont you

understand i was home all last night
more pictures were being taken and
jimmys face froze into a mask

jimmy i fired my press agent itll
never happen again i promise

then jimmy heard loud laughter and
solly mason was at his back solly had
come over to get in the pictures

dont worry honey solly yelled
well be married as soon as i polish off
this bum solly waved at adele and
more pictures were taken while the crowd
stood on the seats rubber-necking to take
in the scene

jimmy looked down at adele and her face
was white frightened as she looked up at
mason

the look broke through jimmys guard
and he knew that regardless of what
had happened or who was to blame there
was one thing more important than the

past-that was the future

okay jimmy said quickly your turn
	fight

to meet me in my dressing room

  then jimmy turned around and placed
his glove in sollys chest shoving hard
get back to your own corner show-off
he grated

  solly stumbled backward and almost fell
ill murder you he yelled and came at
jimmy jimmy stepped forward to meet
him

  suddenly there were trainers policemen
and the referee in between the two solly
allowed himself to be led back to his cor-
ner the coarse grin back on his face
but jimmy struggled to get loose the
crowd screamed its approval of the before-
fight fracas

  jimmy strained in his corner all the
pent-up hate and emotion spilling out of
him as he waited to get at solly mason

  listen said tom dont be a fool

now stay away and counter-punch-

hell force the fight if you dont rush thats
the way he works

  but jimmy didnt hear anything except
the pounding in his ears and when the
bell rang he leaped across the ring to get
at sollys ugly face

  solly backed and blocked as jimmy made
his first vicious attack then solly saw
an opening and slammed home a left
jimmy drove back in throwing solid
smashes at sollys head and face with
everything he had he backed solly into
a corner but didnt land a blow and the
champ tied him up again

  jimmy drove solly back across the ring
with maniacal fury throwing punch after
punch expending energy he was going to
need before fifteen long rounds had gone
their way and solly just retreated before
the outburst picking off and waiting for
his chance

  jimmy thought he had the champ on the
ropes and drew back his right hand to
swing a haymaker but solly saw the
opening and hooked a fast left to jimmys
head

  jimmy threw the right and missed
going off balance and solly racked him
with left right and left before jimmy went
into a clinch

  the challenger made one more attempt
to smother the champion under a flurry of
blows and again he met with no success

stories

as the cool-headed solly covered once
again jimmy drove him to the ropes
solly seeing that jimmy was tiring came
off the ropes slugging

solly caught jimmy with a right that
staggered the younger man then he
exploded a right and left to the body that
hurt and took away some more wind be-
fore blasting at the jaw with both hands

  jimmy saw the flash of stars and pin-
wheels as he tried to clinch but then he
felt another jolt and everything went black
he came to on the floor of the ring with
the lights glaring into his eyes

  four said the referee and jimmy
tried to focus his mind

  five said the referee and jimmy re-
membered where he was

  six and jimmy turned over on his
stomach

 seven he was on his hands and
knees

  eight he was crouched

  nine he got up

  his arms were leaden and his legs
tired as the referee wiped the resin off
his gloves he tried to bring up his guard
as solly came in but his reactions were
too slow and solly whipped home a left
and a right

  solly could have finished the fight but
he was still the supreme egotist and sadist
killer he decided to have a little sport
first he slashed in some cutting blows
that opened wounds on jimmys face and
then let jimmy clinch

  ill teach you to take a girl away from
me he rasped

  he slipped away and laughed as jimmy
tried to renew his attack solly again cut
with his left hand and then drove a hard
right to the body to keep jimmy slowed
down they clinched and solly whispered
in jimmys ear

  she sure gave you a run-around didnt
she

  jimmy tried again and the bell rang
ending round one

  what are you trying to do commit
suicide old tom raged at him between
rounds tom used an antiseptic on his
cuts and then got to work with the collo-
dion jimmy tensed himself against the
the lady likes blood	

stinging pain and it helped to clear his
brain

  listen son said tom you want to
win this fight dont you

  jimmy nodded affirmatively

  then stay away understand stay
away

  ill kill him jimmy grated

  not the way youre fighting you
wont said tom and he stuffed the
mouthpiece in jimmys mouth as the bell
rang

  solly waited for jimmy to come in close
but jimmy stayed out moving around
following toms instructions after his
close call in the first round solly began
to press a little and moved in with left
and right jimmy blocked and tied solly
up still getting his second wind and not
ready to fight

  she aint no saint take it from me
kid solly whispered in the clinch then
they were separated and jimmy had a
sudden desire to drive in and smash that
leering face but he held fast to his self-
control and circled warily

  solly came in and again jimmy tied him
up before any damage could be done that
davenport of mine could tell some tall
stories said solly that time

  when the referee separated them jimmy
lashed out with a hard left but solly
picked it off and moved away laughing
the crowd saw him laugh and responded
jimmy went back into his shell

  it was a slow round compared to the
furious first but jimmy refused to open
up

  the second round went to solly also
but jimmy was in much better shape when
it was over than he had been after the
first

  good boy said tom between rounds
inspecting the cuts which hadnt been re-
opened youve got him coming to you
now start hitting back instead of clinching
but watch out hes got dynamite in those
fists

  jimmy nodded the bell rang and he was
back out they sparred for a moment and
then solly moved quickly stabbing with
a left jimmy rolled away and circled
solly followed and jimmy moved into a
corner letting solly trap him solly

stepped in expecting jimmy to slip away
down the ropes but jimmy set himself
and threw a straight overhand left to the
bridge of sollys nose solly snorted and
jimmy followed in with a right to the pit
of the stomach before solly could recover
he heard the champ grunt

  he tied solly up before the champ could
retaliate and slipped out of the corner
after the clinch solly had been too busy
getting breath back to say anything

  solly followed jimmy his eyes narrow
ancf mean the way jimmy remembered
them and for a moment the knot returned
to his stomach as it used to do when he
was going to take a beating then he re-
membered where he was and shook his
shoulders to loosen the tension he waited
for sollys attack

  it came with lightning swiftness solly
suddenly stepped forward cocking the left
then shifted his feet quickly and slammed
a hard right at jimmys head

that manuever had worked many
times for solly but jimmy had seen
it many times during his seventy-three
beatings and he was inside the right just
as quickly as solly had moved he went
inside and blasted a savage left hook to
sollys face and sank the right in sollys
stomach again

  a warm feeling spread through him as
he heard the air whoosh out of solly he
had found a weak spot solly wasnt in
top condition he was soft around the
middle

  solly hunched a little protecting his
stomach as he followed jimmy jimmy
stopped and met solly head on in the
center of the ring they traded hard
lefts and rights and then jimmy took an-
other left and right to the head as solly
forgot his middle jimmy drove home the
right like a pile driver and solly stopped
in mid-stride jimmy saw his face go
white and drove in smashing blasting and
belting the champion back across the ring
as the bell sounded the end of round three
jimmys round as the tide of battle was
swinging

  but solly mason was a champion and
a fighter and whatever his faults he in-
tended to go down fighting he knew that
fight stories



jimmy had found a weak spot and he knew
he didnt dare box the challenger he
had to score a knockout in the next round
or two before jimmy could continue to
smash the mid-section he rushed across
the ring to unleash his years of boxing
experience and skill upon jimmy

  jimmy blocked the opening blows of the
rush and tried to tie solly up but solly
was ring-wise and kept a hand free slam-
ming home three damaging blows to
jimmys face before jimmy could get in-
side his shoulder jimmy was bleeding
again

 they broke and jimmy found solly
right on top of him catching him in a
corner and rocking him with hard blows
to the head that sent the stars flashing
again jimmy got his chin down and
blasted back hitting and slugging as he
tried to batter his way out of the corner
but the champ nailed him against the
ropes and rocked him again

  jimmy clinched and realized shakily that
old tom and he had counted their chickens
a little too early the referee broke them
and solly was back again throwing ring-
craft aside and matching raw muscle and
hitting power against whatever jimmy
could muster

  jimmy had to fight back and he couldnt
set and drive that blow to the mid-section
that he knew would stop solly they stood
toe-to-toe while the frenzied thousands had
their blood lust stirred and put themselves
in the ring with the fighters giving and
taking

  it was jimmy that gave ground he knew
he was fighting a losing battle the first
round had taken too much of his stamina
he felt his strength ebbing again and he
gave ground suddenly drawing solly with
him solly thought he was hurt and
charged but jimmy set himself and met
the charge with a straight left solly
had his right cocked as he got inside the
left but jimmy beat him to the punch
smashing a right hand into sollys middle
he felt the champion give and drew it back
blasting it home again a third time he
belted it in before solly tied him up hang-

ing on he saw sollys mouthpiece bounce
away across the ring as the champ fought
for breath

  now you can talk better he said into
the champs ear as the referee pulled them
apart

  solly was hurt and covering as jimmy
moved in warily he exploded two left
hands into sollys face but the champ
refused to open up jimmy drove him into
a corner and hit both hands to the head
as the round ended

both fighters were bloody and both
were breathing hard from their sav-
age fight but solly was visibly hurt and
the crowd was yelling for a knockout

  jimmy was as the hunter when he sees
wild game falter he rushed in for the
kill banging away with both hands belting
to the head blasting to the face and
finally sending a crushing right to the
helpless mans mid-section that doubled
him up until the champion fell to the can-
vas like a broken straw he writhed on
the floor but at the count of ten had made
no motion to rise jimmy was the new
worlds champion

  jimmy posed for the pictures and spoke
to the radio audience he received con-
gratulations and shook hands and finally
got out of the ring old tom clearing a
way to the dressing room tom held
everybody out of the dressing room and
finally closed the door against the press of
bodies

  well he said turning around so

now youre- his voice trailed off

and his eyes bugged his new champion
was back in a clinch

  hey old tom was uncertain as to
whether to break the clinch or not

  the new champion worked a hand free
and waved old tom away tom shrugged
his shoulders and opened the door push-
ing out into the press of bodies and closing
the door behind him

  the champion got his hand back into the
clinch and pulled his opponent with the
rich brown hair close the infighting was
delicious

by don shea

his dirty record was behind him tonight hed fight a good clean battle
hed go out on a note of triumph he went out all right    but the not

was terribly sour

    arsh gravel ground into the
i i palms of perry walshs hands and
grated against his cheek searing
pains chased each other through his neck
and down into his chest three bullet holes
can cause a lot of pain it was deathlike
still in the alley after the thundering of
the guns and the metallic patter of run-
ning feet the three thugs had fled leaving
him to die

  the first trickling of a crowd was be-
ginning to gather their feet scraping on
the gravel their azved voices low

  hes unconsciousa vaice from the
crowd came to him dimly look at his

lips move he thinks hes fightm a fight i
guess

  thinks hes fightin a fight huh that
was a laugh just like a fight fan this
was the toughest fight hed ever had hed
better get to work before the kid stabbed
him to death with that left

  what round was this the fourth six
more rounds about twenty-five more
minutes to go

  the cocky youngster glided toward him
behind that razor-sharp left hand darting
in and out and circling to his left jarring
his left and effortlessly backed by a
smooth fighting machine mike travis was


	fight

plenty good lean a hard young battler
a fancypants with an unmarked face a
tanned glistening body bouncing another
step toward the championship

  perry walsh trailed him closely pa-
tiently rationing his strength until the kid
committed a technical mistake delayed a
fraction of a step in sliding out of a cor-
ner perry looped a whistling left hook in-
to his body that should have dulled some
of his spark but didnt the youngster
drove needle-point lefts into his face
stinging sneered as he spun to the left out
of range away from the ropes back to
the middle of the ring

  perry walsh grinned at travis tight
mental checkrein on his temper he must
hold his temper this time hed promised
florence his wife

  the throbbing in the back of his head
had quieted note only the sharp knives in
his throat and chest were left it was chilly

  mike travis moved toward him again
the slight sneer still on his smooth face
confident behind that sniping left hand he
isnt punching at me perry realized hes
walloping at my temper perry half-
crouched shuffled forward let a hail of
jabs rattle high across his forehead and
bulled his man into the ropes pie ground
a half-dozen murderous lefts and rights
into travis belly before they clinched
and as the referee worried them out of it
a backhand flick slapped sweat into his
eyes a deliberate foul perry grinned

  with the bell travis dropped his gloves
and headed toward his corner a swagger
in his walk because the championship was
one round nearer perry turned to his cor-
ner more slowly economizing on strength
and sat down buzz his second sloshed
water into his mouth hard hands lifted his
chest to make room for deep gulps of air
perry casually gazed out into the smoky
dimness a full house his cut would be
a good one and he needed it lotsa shoes
for baby he thought and pictured his wife
listening to the radio alone anxious   
pulling for him not to go crazy again
little katy would be asleep in her crib

  it was still early in the evening when he
and dick had sat down at one of the tables
in his little restaurant to count the days
receipts dick ran the place for him it was

stories

deserted when the three robbers had
walked in guns gripped tight in their
hands coat collars turned up

  he felt good strong as he sat in his
corner buzz was working over him hard
kneading his legs his eyes wandered out
over the crowd again the dirtiest man in
the ring they called him    the bum
well what the hell why not hed thought
for so many years hed been born into
dirt the filth of the east side when he
was nine life had taught him how to fight
life-with every weapon on hand fists feet-
brains and even clawing fingernails-after
a gang of street toughs broke his nose
with a blackjack stole his clothes and left
him naked in the gutter at eleven he had
discovered he had an ally an ungovern-
able temper which shot dynamite into his
hard fists and coated pain with a dulling
redness the magnet of money had lured
him into the ring and fans such as these
had poured more into his pockets they
booed him they hated him but they came
to see him fight because when he got mad
he forgot the rules forgot he was fighting
a foe with padded gloves and was battling
in the streets again for his life sure hed
been kicked out of rings plenty in cali-
fornia he was barred for life but he was
a good fighter almost a great fighter for
the past year he had stood as the insur-
mountable obstacle between all comers and
the title the champion of the champion
always the challenger but never the champ

  but now he was through as a dirty
fighter

  he smacked his wine red gloves together
in grim determination glared at the crowd
just this one last good clean fight against
mike travis tonight hed prove he could
fight clean

  he and dick had half risen in surprise
when the three thieves walked in one of
them had grated all right you guys up
against that wall and no monkey business
dick old and cautious had backed against
the wall hands raised over his head perry
moved slowly fighting the temper which
choked him youll never get azvay with
this hed growled one of the robbers
had made a menacing gesture with his gun

  travis moved into him cautiously
he would be cautious his midriff
the bum



glowed red from the pounding hed been
sucked into during the last round but it
hadnt slowed his blinding speed that ra-
pier left just made him doubly cautious
even sharper

  walsh didnt like travis this guy
would fight dirty given the chance and a
dirty fighter had no place in the ring he
should know he thought of florence
promise me shed pleaded a couple days
ago promise me youll keep your temper
in the ring and out and hed promised

  travis left jabs were small charges of
dynamite exploding in perry walshs face
and he worked in close but travis locked
his elbows and butted him sharply with his
head starting blood flowing from a small
cut under the eye the referee didnt see
the foul perry ignored it and clipped
travis alongside the chin drawing from
his deep reservoir of hard-earned experi-
ence to shake one hand free but he didnt
hurt travis the kid went on his bicycle
again circling to the left and pecking open
that cut beneath perrys eye slowly the
cut grew and blood flowed more freely
suddenly a left hook swished into perrys
groin low it didnt hurt him or slow him
and the referee warned travis but perry
knew that wouldnt stop these tactics

  a film as red as the blood smeared
across his cheek slowly rose in perry he
was getting the business the old crimson
tide of ungovernable anger welled within
him his eyes narrowed to twin slits then
he suddenly stopped his forward rush as
he remembered florence

  he halted for a moment shaken then
moved into travis more confidently he
had beaten the thing and could have hit
travis out of sheer joy after the bell if the
youngster hadnt suddenly sat down perry
realized travis had cleverly worked him
into his own corner just as the bell rang
but he didnt care he was inwardly glow-
ing proudly as he strode across the ring
to his corner

  he lay back buzz leaned close to his
ear better get goin this guys givin
you the works perry nodded grinned at
him then smiled and waved at travis
across the ring buzz mouth fell open in
astonishment a surprised murmur ran

-fight-fall

through the crowd perry chuckled flor-
ence would appreciate that

  the three thieves had him covered cold
he knew that well let them have the
money which was little enough hed
thought then dick in his confusion had
allowed his hands to drop one of the
thugs had half-whirled and crashed his
pistol barrel alongside the old mans head
crumpling kirn to the floor then perry
knew what he had to do and he was proud
that he did it coldly and not in anger one
quick step had carried him to the nearest
man a hard right knocked him across a
table perry spun around toward the others

  guns roared one slug had smashed into
his neck hed staggered back as another
had blasted into his chest

  perry kept his eyes on the timekeper
and was out of his corner with the bell
buzz was yelling at his back for him to
bore in to infight the kid tossed some
rights hard and sharp perry worked over
his stomach with both hands before switch-
ing to a clean uppercut he was feeling
good now and getting stronger the sweat
rolled freely lubricated his big muscles
travis took a lesson from what had hap-
pened before when he tried to swap
punches and went back to his educated
left hand unstitching the cut under perrys
eye perry grinned at these tactics travis
circled always back and away to his left
and walsh deliberately stopped in the
middle of the ring and waved him in
but travis merely spat out a foul word
which perry couldnt identify then the
kid moved in swiftly to bounce two knife-
like lefts off the cut again

  the youngster was working even faster
now swift like a collie in and out what
round was it  eighth round  perry wasnt
sure it was a good hard fight

  he went after travis blocking him into
a corner while his eye sopped up a dozen
of those snake-like left hands blood
flowed freely now and travis was trying
to out-maneuver him to stagger him with
a right cross and dance free perry knew
the punch was coming flexed his knees
slightly to let it slide past his jaw over his
left shoulder and then curved a looping
left hook against travis ribs travis
grunted and scowled smashed a hard right
	fight stories

below the belt it hurt but perry only
grinned at him he had that temper situa-
tion well in hand now the kid finally
worked out of the trap back into the
middle of the ring

  perry had remained standing his legs
spread far apart weaving slightly a dazed
look in his eyes from the floor the third
bandit had propped himself on an elbow
to pump another bullet just below perrys
heart then the bandits had fled racing
into the street perry had staggered to the
open door after them they were running
up the alley alongside the building perry
had follmoed a feiv weak steps then had
collapsed in the gravel

  travis was there in front of him always
stabbing moving away from perrys right
hand his chin hidden behind a raised left
shoulder he was tough and fast all right
the blood ran into perrys eye again and
he cocked his head to see travis roughed
him in the clinches and he was proud of
his ability to curb the instinct to reply with
similar tactics to refrain from grating the
laces across travis face or to clip him
with an elbow perry ducked his head and
bored in

  that round was even maybe a shade on
his side he was breathing hard but the
pace was telling on travis too a hard
red lump was raised on one cheek one eye
was dark and his ribs would ache but ev-
ery wallop still had plenty of sting

  between the rounds perry sat and
chuckled at the fight he was making what
a field day the sportswriters would have
he could see the headlines dirty fighter
gives technique a bath he chuckled
again

  buzz worked on the bad eye so he could
see and perry asked himself if he could
somewhere find something deep down
within himself this last round to score a
knockout wind up his career with a big
noise

  with the bell he rose slowly cold cal-
culated untouched by the drug of anger
which had won him previous battles he
accepted travis straight left jabs with
disdain crowded beneath the flurry of
whiplike blows to rip home a short right

another one and a left the crowd rose
with a roar

  perry moved into the kid forced him
across the ring ripped across his middle
with piston-like precision switching to his
face travis fought back hard his breath
whistling jabbing crossing

  perry took a faceful of punishment to
get travis where he couldnt circle and he
rocked him with a right hook to the jaw
and dropped his left fist half-way to the
wrist into his body travis staggered
quickly recovered and fought back with
dogged ferocity

  both were battling now their hardest
travis forgot his jabs as they squared
away in the center of the ring and head
burrowed between his thick shoulders
perry answered him with flying fists

  dimly through the great pain he could
hear the screaming of an ambulance siren
in the distance

  travis folded quickly perry ripped a
short left into his solar plexus and left
him gasping the kids hands dropped
perry splashed rights and lefts into his
face drove him across the ring a crisp
left hook straightened travis up and a
whistling right uppercut dropped him for
a nine count he struggled to his knees
raised one foot under him then sprawled
forward on his face

 perry was exultant as he slipped
through the ropes bathrobe thrown over
his shoulders the tumult of the mob roar-
ing in his ears he couldnt wait to phone
florence to hear her happy congratula-
tions over not losing his temper he was
going to retire after a good clean fight

  the gravel was still harsh against his
palms but strangely his throat and chest
no longer hurt then his hands clawed at
the alleyway one last time a dull voice in
the crowd spoke but he didnt hear the
words

  cripes what a tough break and over
such a little bit of dough too he woiridd
made a hundred times that much fightin

by nathan broch

a short story

 the dying prizefighter scooped up the hills with his good hand and held them against
 the dimmed light so they looked like a round green glove with fancy pictures on it

they had put a screen around his
bed and now he was looking up at
them through his one good eye the
left eye the one that wasnt busted

  the interne had a pad in his hand and
a pencil and tried a smile the nurse
wasnt doing anything not even smiling
she just stood there looking down at the
dying prizefighter

  just a formality purred the interne
how you spell that name again

  c-l-e-m his breath rattled low with
the spelling z-e-l-l-o

  right the interne crossed something
out on his pad and wrote down the cor-
rect name married

  clem shook his head a little only my
mother he whispered and my kid sis-
ter over in lakewood it hurt to speak
and the good eye closed for a moment
then opened again slowly dragging the lid
with the words its all white in lake-
wood now he muttered my kid sisters

mured trouble with his stomach ulcers

fered

interne

  he was shaking his head his eyebrows
way up

clem said carolli always goes to cleve-
land when he gets those ulcers

  the interne gave a short laugh the

land just get my cut hundred and thirty

and slipped out and the interne closed it
after her and came back to the bed

  carollis a good guy the good eye
smiled again only about money some-
times he forgets about money account of
those ulcers

  then he goes to cleveland irony
flickered in the internes voice but it got
lost against the white screen against the
battered body of the dying man

  the interne nodded clem wasnt look-
ing at him i hope shell find him on that

  for a while they didnt speak some-
times they were watching each other
sometimes the interne got a hold of clems
good hand the one that wasnt broken
and felt the pulse and shook his head
without really shaking it

  after a long time clem said maybe
she didnt find him

  im sure she will the interne stole a
glance at his watch

  then the nurse slipped back through
the screen here she leaned across the
bed a hundred and thirty dollars
clems good hand felt over the bills

thanks for finding him hes a good sick
guy carolli

  yes said the nurse a good man

  those ulcers he scooped the bills
with his good hand holding them against
the dimmed light so they looked like a
round green glove with fancy pictures on
it

  suddenly the good hand wasnt good
any more it dropped heavily by the side
of the bed and the green glove with pic-
tures fluttered limply to the floor

  the interne stooped for the bills and
gave them to the nurse then they cov-
ered the dead fighter and walked out to-
gether through the screen

  never thought youd find that man-
ager the interne sounded hoarse

  the nurse nodded i had him paged
and he came to the information booth we
talked

  and he gave you the money

  she shook her head that managers
horrible maybe insane or something
once they kiss the mat he told me
theyre through and theres no cut and
with that he ran for his train

  but you showed that boy the money
the nurse smiled my own money
she whispered i never knew it could buy
that much
tony zale - his ring story

by robt r richards

  he never caught the fancy of the fight mob nor the wild acclaim of press
  row a thorough workman a clean-liver an uncolorful precisionist with
  a wide knowledge of the ring game seldom does tony zales road to the
  middleweight title was long and tough    and his record speaks for itself

cold pale eyes raked the ringside
for a friendly face tony zale saw
few of them it was a long way
from gary to seattle not many steel
workers could make the coast trip but those
who did made up for their lack of numbers
by loud cheering for tony zale their
faith had never wavered zale was their
idol they had been with tony when he
was beaten so often in the past that he
had to quit the ring even when he quit
they knew he would come back tony was
as tough as garys steel

  the steel city slugger sat calmly in his
corner typical of tony unworried un-
hurried and here he was facing the most
terrific left hook artist among the middle-
weights zale never could stop a left hook
in his early days and now six years after
his pro debut his only defense for a
snaking left was hitting the other man
quicker and harder

  tony grinned at the few familiar faces
beyond the blazing ringlights as long as
there was one gary steel worker in the
house that was enough to spur him on
that and the terrible anger he felt as he
stared at a hostak it had taken tony
ten long hard years to fight his way up
from the amateurs to a big name bout a
dozen setbacks had marred his climb to-
wards the top but always tony fought
to get away from the steel mills not that
tony felt higher than the work it was
just that he knew he was made for some-
thing else he knew it when he was still
an amateur he knew it when he climbed
through the ropes for the first time

  the prize-ring was a rainbow and the
championship was the pot of gold at the
end of it tony was rugged he could
sock he had endless courage he fought
like the blond tiger that he was throwing

his all into every punch but the ring
had its paradoxes there were times when
a man won and it was just as though he
had lost seven months before he
had fought this same a hostak in
chicago tony had come off the deck
to thrash him after being dropped by a
whizzing left hook

  afterwards it was learned that hostak
had broken his hand after dropping tony
they called zales victory a fluke it hurt
when you licked a man and then every-
body went around saying you were just
plumb lucky and hadnt really beaten him
at all tonight tony was getting his sec-
ond chance perhaps the only chance hed
ever have to make good again

  hostak was the national boxing asso-
ciation middleweight champion the
honor was worth more than half of the
disputed world title

  hostak and his manager decided to
make the zale camp pay if they wanted
a return match and a shot at hostaks
title although hostak had lost seven
months ago he still retained his title as
both men had come in over the official
weight tonys managers were glum when
they told him hostaks terms you see
that doesnt even leave us enough for
training expenses sam pian said tony
snapped the heck with the expenses
ill fight him for nothing ive just got
to have that title sam i know i can beat
hostak and you know it sam smiled
okay tony then well travel to seattle

  zale faced hostak beneath the blaze of
lights as the referee issued instructions
he saw the cool confidence the quiet
superiority in hostaks face and it an-
noyed him

  maybe you dont think i belong in here
with you al and maybe you can show




fight stories

me that i dont but i dont think so
ive come two thousand miles to meet you
hostak without a cent coming to me a
man doesnt travel that way for nothing

  the fighters shook hands it was
written all over tony zales cold pale eyes
and the grim line of his lips

  im going to lick you hostak youll
never send me back to gary in defeat
never send me back to the steel mills ill
show you that first win was no fluke

the bell tense prayer-like silence
envelopes the crowd the two hard-
est hitters among the middle weights crowd
each other beneath the lights no room
to breathe barely room to punch whack
whack they smash at each other and the
echo of scorching leather can be heard in
the back rows hostak rushes his punches
for one of his famous one round knock-
outs zale slams with gusto

  one round melts into another like a
roaring flame not even a simple jab is
thrown without murderous intentions the
bell between rounds is a mere punctuation

mark separating the fighters for a brief
minute until they tear at each other again

  round four sam pian is happy youre
ahead tony stay out in front zale nods
the roar of the crowd is in his ears as
hostak rushes him in the fifth the
champions pride is badly wounded hes
willing to gamble everything on a knockout
and he does left hooks buck from his
shoulder in an endless stream rights
windmill into tony zales face but the
gary fighter stays with the rangy semi-
bald hostak

  mid-way in the fifth tony slams back
with an offensive of his own he spikes
hostaks big guns and opens a cut over
the champions eye zale will not be
denied his jaw aches from the shock of
hostaks lefts his body is sore from the
terrific infighting but theres no qut in
tony zale no signs of let up the steel
city slugger is a hurricane in the tenth
hostak reels and rolls beneath his shatter-
ing blows hostak has never been on the
canvas never been knocked out tony
zale grits his teeth he must drive him
tony zale-his ring story



to the deck knock him cold -- the
th round zales dynamite-laden fists ex-
plode on hostaks granite jaw the gran-
ite is blasted hostak takes the count while
the crowd cheers the thrilling fight with
delight and the handful of gary steel-
workers go absolutely mad

  tony zale is a fighting champion he
draws the line against nobody big billy
soose six feet tall rangy long armed
long legged a crafty thinned out light
heavyweight wants an over-the-weight
match with zale tony might have ducked
it but he took the match soose kangaroos
all over tony and grabs the decision once
again they start calling zale a second rater
even when hes on the top they try and
drag him down soose moves into the
light-heavyweight division where he be-
longs and leaves tony looking foolish

  the world middleweight championship is
still in a muddle one half is owned by tony
the other half is claimed by ken overlin
had mike jacobs been willing to take a
chance a few months back things might

have been different shortly before tonys
spectacular knockout of hostak zales
managers had begged jacobs to give tony
a shot at ceferino garcia for the new
york version of the title mike chose
ken overlin instead zale had no follow-
ing in the east and besides his past
record was studded with defeats tonys
pilots pian and winch talked their
charges ability up to the skies

  jacobs was insistent i want overlin
not zale pian argued that tony would
turn in a terrific performance against
garcia as compared to the dull slapper-
dapper affair one could expect from over-
lin there was no use arguing with the
big promoter

  like many of zales opponents who had
once dropped tony to the canvas a
hostak was hard to convince in their first
encounter he had broken his hand in
their second clash als eyes were cut up
badly besides he had tony in a bad
way during the fifth round of their seattle
clash chicago was the scene of their third

graziano teas furious his murderous right came screeching at zales jaw


fight stories

tangle tony ripped at hostak from the
opening gong the terrific socking semi-
bald seattle boxer was slugged into obliv-
ion before the second round ended it was
a tremendous victory for tony before
the home town folks sam pian knew
that benny rays fighter was on top to
stay

  the meeting of sam tony and benny
ray is a story in itself it marked a
turning point in zales ring career tony
often felt that afternoon in traftons gym
made his rise to the peak possible benny
ray was a local gary promoter he was
an exceptionally shrewd judge of boxers
having predicted the rise of barney ross
and joe louis

  tony came smiling into traf tons gym
one day benny rays eyes narrowed
zale had quit the ring in  and here it
was two years later with tony showing
up with a boxers handbag zale stepped
gingerly toward ray his pale blue eyes
eager and alive ive been looking for
you benny the fighter said

  benny glanced at the handbag i dont
get it last i heard you were back in the
steel mills

  but not for keeps tony smiled ive
just got to take another crack at fighting
again im ready to hit the comeback trail
if youll manage me benny

  the gary promoter thought it over
this zale kid was made of tough fibre
he had known tony since way back when
the gary slugger had been pushed too
fast over-matched rushed in against top
notchers without having mastered the rudi-
ments of pro fighting benny grinned
when he saw sam pian barney rosss
famous manager

 sam pian was the answer to tony
zale it would give benny a chance to
settle a debt that could not be repaid in
money many years back benny ray was
down on his heels sam pian had staked
him without blinking an eye benny would
never forget it as long as he lived the
promoter glanced at zale given a top
notch manager who could nurse him along
this kid was set for ring stardom sam
pian was that manager

  how about it am benny said hes
a grand kid with a barrel load of guts

remember i picked out ross and joe
louis well tony zale is going to be
right up there with them some day

  zale was thrilled he hoped sam pian
would take him into tow okay benny
ive seen this boy in action ill bring him
to the top for you anytime you want him
back hes yours for years pian handled
benny rays fighter benny never asked
for him back each year he predicted
great things for tony pian and zale
were satisfied and benny ray died happily
some time later he never did see tony
rise to stardom but he had squared his
debt with pian

  tony followed pians instructions to
the last letter the desire to make good
burned in zale like a flame zale was the
strangest tough guy pian had ever run
across

 he never drank never swore he
trained for each match as though it
was the last and greatest fight of his
career when he threw a punch even a
simple jab he tossed everything he had
behind it he didnt just train he was
fanatically devoted to training other
fighters might balk at the grind but not
tony other fighters might take it easy
between bouts but tony went right on
with some part of his training regime

  zale drove himself relentlessly he
wanted as much perfection as he was cap-
able of when he finished one bout he
was already thinking of another sam
pian was pleased by his hard driving pro-
tege others were puzzled by this total
devotion to ring warfare what was tony
zale seeking did he want to become the
greatest fighter of all time what made
him lash back ten times as hard when the
chips were stacked against him what
made him stand up under beatings that
most fighters would have quit

  tony zale was a two fisted tough guy
between the ropes who hated to fight
outside the ring he was a physical man
who loved to read a kid who insisted upon
obtaining a high school education while
laboring in the steel mills tony zale in
his own quiet way was an engine but
there was no answer to tony zales fierce
drive his tremendous will to succeed the
answer was in the tony zale who faced
tony zale-his ring story



hostak abrams conn and graziano yes
the answer was there but the key to
the question what drove tony zale -
was forged a long time ago when he was
a boy in gary

ii

anthony florian zaleski

was born in the fiery reflection of
the gary steel mills ever since he was
a child he could remember the reddish
glow in the night sky the soot-covered
smoke-ridden city at the lake bottom the
laborers going to work with green lunch
pails the mournful cry of the factory
whistles announcing the end of one dreary
shift and the start of another

  the mills of gary claimed everyone
sooner or later tonys polish born
parents settled in gary in  his
father was a moulder in the blazing
foundry of the illinois steel corporation
automobiles were new fangled reckless
and expensive things joseph zaleski was
fond of using a bicycle one day papa
zaleski was found dead on the streets of
gary his bicycle a twisted wreck after
having been struck by an automobile

  his widow was left with seven children
five boys and two girls the road ahead
was a hard one for the family mary
the eldest daughter went to work one
by one the zaleski boys followed each
other into the roaring infernos of the
steel mills as each lad reached fifteen
he took up his lunch pail and headed for
the mills young tonys turn came soon
enough

  he neither hated nor liked the mills at
first it was work and the family needed
money tony was never one to runaway
from a fact it was a fact that if he
worked in the mills and didnt get himself
an education he might not get anywhere
either his mother encouraged him along
those lines and he graduated from high
school he was a fine student and read
a great deal along with indulging in sports
his older brothers both amateur boxers
donned the gloves with him when tony
was only ten

  he got used to the feel of padded
leather it wasnt strange that he entered

the golden gloves at the age of sixteen
nor was it odd that he won the gary
welterweight and middleweight titles four
times in a row tony rolled up fifty knock-
outs in ninety-five contests in the winter
of  lie travelled to new york in order
to represent chicago in the inter-city finals

  tony was a middleweight he was sure
to hold his own in that division a big
sleepy-eyed colored boy with a shy pleas-
ant smile was representing chicago in
the light-heavy weight division he was
a terrific socker for an amateur this joe
louis

  his new york opponent stocky melio
bettina was far above average for an
amateur likewise in a few years he went
on to win the worlds light-heavyweight
championship at the last minute joe
louis was disqualified from the team as
his official residence was detroit and not
chicago somebody had to fill the brown
bombers place against a rugged mauler
like bettina

  tony zale the middleweight from sub-
urban gary was the windy citys answer
to bettina tony was tough dead game
he could hit like a mule and take a
punch without backing up of course zale
only weighed  to bettinas well stacked
 pounds but for a kid who managed
to graduate from high school and work in
the steel mills at the same time it shouldnt
have been too great a handicap provided
you werent in zales shoes facing husky
melio bettina

  madison sq garden was packed bull
bodied hairy chested melio bettina
scowled in his corner a chunky unortho-
dox southpaw with tremendous power in
his hefty frame melio certainly didnt
look like an amateur the mob waited
anxiously for his opponent they stared
in disbelief as tonv zale stepped through
the ropes the blond kid from the mid-
west appeared awfully fragile alongside
bettina so this was the substitute for
joe louis well chalk up a knockout for
new york

  tony could read it in their faces hear it
in their voices when he shed his robe he
stood nonchalantly in his corner broad
shouldered square jawed cucumber cool
nothing could ruffle tony zale once he
	fight

slipped through the ropes he waited
calmly for the opening bell zale rubbed
his gloves together and rushed at the
gongs hollow sound bettina sailed into
him they collided in mid-ring and a sizz-
ling fight was on

  zale was backed against the ropes by
the crushing weight advantage of bettina
he lashed furiously at his stocky foe
tony in trouble was ten times as danger-
ous even in these early simon pure days

  bettina sopped up a pulverizing right
to the body the crowd roared and rose
from their seats melio was grovelling on
the canvas goliath had been hit by
davids slingshot the bull-torsoed battler
came off the deck with murder in his eyes
he lunged at the comparatively fragile
zale his awkward southpaw stance threw
tony off his tweny-two pound weight
edge shoved zale back tony never quit
or yielded for a moment he slugged his
way to the final bell while the mob shouted
their approval bettina got the decision
zale got the glory tony had put up one
of the gamest toughest stands ever dis-
played in a handicap fight

  tony had gone as far as he could in
the amateurs his record of fifty knock-
out victories was sensational to say the
least he returned to gary and was
roundly congratulated by his family and
fellow steel workers tony walked along
the grimy streets he stared at the red-
dish glow in the night sky the mills just
as he had seen them since he was a child
the roaring open hearth furnace ready to
claim him again the long hours the
dreary nights the mechanical robot march
of men through an inferno suddenly
tony zale hated the mills

  his father his brothers his relatives
and his pals were all part of the mills
chained to rivers of molten metals for-
ever smelling the warm rusty odor of hot
steel in their nostrils steel was on their
clothes bits of metal in their skin they
washed and scrubbed only to take in more
steel again sure the mills had made him
strong and tough the mills had molded
him like an ingot of steel it was hard
work honest work tony didnt balk at
it but there was another door a door
to fame and fortune to a security he could

stories

never know in the mills if he could open
that door mom would never have to worry
about meeting bills again the possibility
of it lay within his fists the prize-ring
could free him from the mills and give
mom the family and himself a security
they had never known since father zaleski
had been killed on the smoke fogged
streets of gary

  therein lay the answer to what drove
tony zale the kid from gary fought to
stay away from the steel mills he drove
himself relentlessly in order to make a
better life for himself and others sure
tony wanted fortune but only enough to
buy himself security fame yes he would
take that too in his own shy modest way
as long as he was a hero to his hard
working mother and family that was
enough fame for tony zale mom had
pinned a great many hopes on him she
prayed that her boy would make good in
his newly chosen profession tony was
courageous bright ambitious he must
make good he must be happy he was
her son she had seen too many hard-
ships among the steel workers to deny
tony his gambling attempt at fame and
fortune

chicago wasnt like gary the
windy city was a huge indifferent
place for tony zale fighting for pay
was like beginning his career all over
again he had to start from the bottom
four rounders prelims that often bored
the customers as they waited for the main
event but tony zale was different right
from the start he tore from his corner
and fought with everything he had

  unknowns allen simpson millsap lis-
ton tony blasted them to the canvas he
never took a rest he was anxious to make
good over-anxious there were times
when no more than seventy-two hours
elapsed between bouts tony would fight
on a monday night and be back in the
ring on thursday his competition in-
creased by leaps and bounds in five
short months he had punched himself into
the main event class there was no smart
manager to pull strings for him no ins
with a promoter no organization behind
him nothing to back him up but a furious
tony zale-his ring story



courageous desire to make good he
lacked experience badly

 there was no master minding jack
blackburn to train and guide him a la
joe louis nor was there a shrewd and
patient manager devoted unhurried tak-
ing endless time to develop him like pop
foster had done for jimmy mclarnin
there was nothing but tony zale vs the
other fighters in the ring his older
brother johnny an ex-amateur boxer was
too busy making his own way in the steel
mills johnny knew training inside and
out just like he knew his kid brother but
the mills had claimed him long ago and
he belonged to them

  the hour glass of tony zales success
began to crack in less than half a year
skillful seasoned main event boxers like
jack gibbons took decisions over him
jack the nephew of two great boxers of
yesterday mike and tommy gibbons had
his uncles to teach him the subleties of
ring craft tony was tired he needed a
rest he went right on fighting from one
mis-match to another he began to slide
rapidly down to the preliminaries again
someone by the name of bazzione took a
decision over him a guy named phagan
knocked him out a ham and egger like
jack moran held him to a miserable six
round draw

  the hour glass of success had broken
two years after beginning his ring career
tony zale was back where he started
from tony came back to gary in de-
feat the steelworkers his family and
mom were still all for him gradually tony
drifted toward the dreaded mills he took
up his place before the open hearth furnace
again and was silent tonys ambition was
halted not crushed ted momot a friend
talked tony into a florida trip

  for the first time in his life the steel
city slugger took a long rest he basked
in the sun fished and loafed the roar
of the mills and the dim fight crowds were
far behind him lying on the sand staring
at the tropical blue sky gave tonys tired
body a chance to heal and his brain a
chance to think he was twenty-three
years old vibrant life and hope surged
back into his powerful physique again

  he decided to make a comeback no

rushing no over-matching this time he
didnt care if it took him ten years tony
zale was determined to master his trade
he refused to become discouraged despite
any set backs of the past or future tony
knew he had the stuff melio bettina was
a top rank pro fighter now and he had
dropped bettina on the deck just two short
years ago tony zale returned to chicago
determined to turn his back on the steel
mills of gary forever

  things werent easy at first not even
with sam pain at the helm tony was
rusty there was plenty to learn becoming
a four round prelim boy again wasnt very
inspiring either he climbed back very
slowly this time fighting several return
matches until he mastered his opponents
pie had his downs as well as ups once
again he was kayoed this time by jimmy
clark a shadow of a doubt blackened
tonys morale but he recalled a promise
that would keep him plugging towards the
championship even if everything else
failed

  tony loved his mother dearly despite
his rugged tough self-sufficient fibre he
was a mommas boy tony helped around
the kitchen washed dishes mopped floors
even baked cakes mom was always there
to encourage him when he was glum mom
was there to pray for him when he fought
to worry when he lost and feel hopeful
when her boy won tony knew how much
she worried about his career it wasnt
easy for a mother to see her son come
home with nicks and scars and stitches
but if it was what tony wanted if there
was a rainbow and a pot of gold at the
end of the trail it was alright with her
tony promised that he would make good
in a great big way he would drop the
middleweight championship of the world
in her lap someday she would see that
all her hopes were not in vain

  mother zaleski did live long enough to
see her tony crowned champion of the
world it was one of the happiest mo-
ments of tonys life when he returned
to their modest home with a title in his
belt

  the blackest day in tonys life was the
day he received a call from his brother
john while training at hot springs ar-


fight stories

kansas john said that mom was critically
ill tony took a plane to gary he arrived
just a few minutes before mom died tony
never fought thereafter without thinking
of his mother he never quite got over
the feeling that mom wasnt still at home
listening to him fight over the radio or
waiting to hear his own story of defeat or
victory

  zale faced his kayo conqueror jimmy
clark again this time tony handled him
with a vengeance clark collapsed before
the blazing fury of tonys attack clark
made the supreme mistake of tangling with
tony for a third time zale beat him to
the canvas with a thunderous onslaught
just a few minutes after the opening bell
the steel city slugger had more than
squared his account

  no other fighter in modern times with
the exception of joe louis had tonys
ability to score astonishing successes in
repeat performances it was true against
hostak clark graziano and a trouble-
some slugger steve mamakos steve was
cutting a wide swath among the middle-
weights shortly after zales series with
hostak

  mamakos was the kind of a fighter that
never wins a title but makes it hell for
those who try tony took on this brawler
in chicago one night mamakos nearly
raised the roof with his slugging tactics
tony skidded over the line with a decision
and signed for a return slug-fest the
n b a middleweight title was at stake
and steve was set to score the biggest
upset of the year

  mamakos could punch like blazes he
staggered tony early in the fight round
after round he slammed at the steel city
slugger mamakos long experience against
trial horses cagey veterans confusing
southpaws and unorthodox battlers was
paying off against zale mamakos tossed
the book at tony there wasnt a punch
or trick he forgot to employ

  tony stepped into steves wicked swings
and ended up on the canvas the stadium
was in an uproar amazingly cool but
groggy zale swung back into action
sooner or later he would catch up with
mamakos steve drove him from pillar
to post now that he had the upper hand

tony held down the lid of his dynamite
until he could get a clean shot at his
enemy he was in no mood to be trapped
out of his nba title by a reckless gam-
ble round after round he searched for
an opening in the weaving form of mama-
kos there were none

  it was the fourteenth round the fans
were hysterical with excitement steve
mamakos was beating tony zale for
once the gary slugger was failing to turn
in a terrific performance in a return go
the only cool head in the house was tony
zales he lit into mamakos unleashed
everything he was capable of throwing
and kept tossing it until he broke through
mamakos stared in disbelief from the
canvas as the referee tolled ten and out
steve was never much good after that
night tony zales furious outburst had
shattered something else besides his jaw-
bone

ill

the worlds middleweignt
championship still remained dis-
puted in  as it had been for ten
years following the retirement of mickey
walker in november of  it narrowed
down to tony zale and georgie abrams
mike jacobs could no longer deny zale
a garden title scrap the boxing com-
mission and the fans demanded seeing this
slugger from the mid-west

  georgie abrams was a weird looking
fighter bald with a thick mat of hair
curling over his torso loose armed loose
shanked somewhat flabby around the mid-
dle and yet he was on the trim side he
was an odd combination of cleverness and
rough house tactics his big forehead
loomed like a naked skull beneath the
bright ring lights

  neither abrams appearance nor tre-
mendous reputation ruffled zale he was
fully aware of the washingtonians ex-
ceptional glove talent

tried to shut his ears against the crowds

tony zale-his ring story



years of ups and downs in this very
ring he had slugged it out with melio
bettina for an amateur title and now he
had come back as a full fledged profes-
sional ring smart experienced wised
up in the art of punching for pay tony
was a long way from the steel mills and
he was happy

 sam pian had warned him about
abrams watch that left hook tony
georgie knows how to throw it with ven-
geance zales pale eyes narrowed no
matter how much he drilled tony still
hadnt found a fool proof defense for a
spinning left hook aside from hitting the
other man before he got his it was
perfectly alright with tony a fighters
job was taking it as well as dishing it
out the steel city slugger wasnt one
to seek a soft berth

  georgie abrams awaited the bell with
supreme confidence it was as simple as
the alphabet billy soose had outboxed
zale he had trimmed soose not once
but three times hostak had nearly torn
zales head off with a smashing left hook
georgie abrams had the best left hook in
the business since hostak zale was a
willing mixer all the better there wasnt
a sportswriter in the nation who thought
he wasnt capable of outboxing zale

  abrams snorted at the bell zale came
out characteristic pose tow head tipped
forward deep set pale eyes staring search-
ing lft extended curled for action right
drawn up against his chin abrams
slammed in so he wanted to make a
fight of it from the opening bell it was
double okay with tony zale the steel
city slugger felt his gloves drive hard
against abrams cross-webbed arms geor-
gie was a lanky spider with a fatal sting in
his left

  in his own way abrams was as awk-
ward as bettina leather sizzled against
flesh in a hot exchange georgie was
tough smart a crack infighter tony kept
pushing forward biff bang zale felt
his legs buckling he was on the canvas
the right side of his face fevered from
abrams left hook

  take it easy tony keep calm keep
cool the grey shirted arm of the referee
swung like a metronome before his pale

eyes the mob roar surged at him from
balcony and mezzanine one    two   
three    four zale made no attempt
to move five    six    seven he
brushed his gloves against satin trunks
eight zale picked up the count at nine
and bounced to his feet back in the cor-
ner sam pian was able to breath again

  tony waded into abrams it was gruel-
ling uphill fighting georgie had an iron
clad defense with his cross-webbed arms
each round the steel city slugger increased
his pace the bald head loomed before
him the long face seemed to mock his
efforts georgie abrams wras smarter and
faster and just as tough as the man from
the mills zale hammered relentlessly

  he felt abrams grab and hold in the
fourth move back in the fifth blood
trickled from georgies eyes in the sixth
zale was smashing punishing rights at the
heart and head it was in the bag abrams
was fading mid-way bang that vicious
left drove at tony in the eighth zale could
feel his teeth chatter the crowd faces
blurred abrams swarmed all over him
the bell was welcome relief

  tony let himself die for sixty seconds
arms hanging limply eyes closed he
heard nothing wanted to hear nothing but
the blood bubbling through his veins
feeding his muscles it was tony zales
way of getting three minutes rest out of
sixty seconds

  tony swept abrams across the ring in
the ninth his drive was too furious for
denial georgie was rocked by jolting jabs
shaken to his ankles by thunderous rights
desperately abrams worked himself in
and out of clinches he held for dear
life tony slammed him against the ropes
georgies instinct born of long experience
and a cast iron defensive network of arms
was the only thing that held him up

  zale blasted his way to an overwhelming
decision at the final bell abrams big
face was a red blood mask his eyes
hammered to a pulp nose cheeks lips
swollen georgie could barely make it to
his corner his arms were bruised and
stiff his body beaten into a pink flame
he had paid the price for refusing to yield
before tony zale

  the new undisputed middleweight


fight stories

champion of the world tony shivered
with joy at the words an official champ-
ion at last on top of the fistic world
seven years almost to a day since his
amateur scrap against bettina in this same
ring tony bounded across the ring
words of praise for his beaten foe the
microphone was shoved before him the
first words out of his mouth were for the
home folks in gary familiar faces
jammed his dressing room the steel city
boys would travel twice around the world
to see tony fight

  mike jacobs clamored for tony zale
now out of the smoke and din of the
dressing room tony heard billy conns
name mentioned billy conn mike
jacobs wants me to fight billy conn
sure ill fight him who cares if conns
a lightheavy or a heayweight who cares
if he almost licked joe louis ill fight
joe louis if mike wants me to that
was tony zale not boasting just willing
to trade leather with any man in the ring

  sam pian signed for the conn match
immediately the sports writers thought
he was crazy if believing implicity in
the ability of tony zale to stand up against
any man in the ring was insanity then
sam pian was crazy

tony zale didnt linger in new
york very long he never felt at
home outside of gary gary people were
his people the kind he had grown up
with and knew best tony shook hands
around the steel city until his fingers were
sore he visited his old haunts places
he had never gotten away from places
he never wanted to get away from st
hedwigs catholic grammar school in
gary father grothouse the priest who
knew him ever since he was a kid jack
gilroy physical director for gary schools
the fellows he had played handball and
baseball with the steel workers the name-
less numerous chums around the city who
no more felt at home in gary without
seeing tony zale then he did when he
was away from them

  yes  was a great year for tony
zale it was at this time that he met a
very striking brunette it was the best
st hedwigs party he had ever attended

adeline richwalskis presence had seen to
that she was a sweet girl a wonderful
girl she would make a good wife for
tony zale now that he could settle down
he kept running into her by accident in
gary in chicago on the street in a bus
in a train at a social gathering

  after his fight with billy conn zale
enlisted in the navy two days later he
married adeline nobody was surprised
adeline became part of the large zaleski
family with their happy gatherings things
were settling for tony zale the steel
city slugger couldnt forsee the future
he had no idea what would happen against
conn except that he would fight like a
tiger he had no idea how long the war
would last and like everyone else he had
never heard of rocky graziano

  february   the war is in full
swing uniforms can be spotted all over
the garden the crowd has turned out
for one of the biggest handicap matches
ever staged billy conn hard hitting pitts-
burgh heavyweight who eight short months
ago flattened joe louis is facing the 
pounder tony zale

  it doesnt make sense zale has no busi-
ness being in there with conn joe louis
is introduced in uniform he smiles
broadly at his rousing reception he shakes
hands with conn then zale there is
admiration in the brown bombers eyes
as he speaks with tony zale both of
them came up from the chicago amateurs
together zale went to bat for him against
bettina the night joe was disqualified
conn nearly took joes title people are
talking louis isnt what he was cracked
up to be who is conn can a small
guy like tony zale lick him

  joe sits tensely in his ringside seat the
outcome of conn vs zale is darned im-
portant for the brown bomber if zale
upsets billy conn then the public is right
joe louis has lost his grip and a million
dollar future gate will be swept away the
odds are heavy on conn but joe remem-
bers tony zale from those amateur days
the steel city sluggers gameness is a
factor to be reckoned with

  conn six feet tall towers over five feet
eight inch tony zale the pittsburgh
fighter has everything but stamina and
tony zale-his ring story

courage over tony zale its apparent from
the start conns superiority billy is fast
and shifty he had reach height weight
conn moves rapidly on the balls of his
feet blocks beautifully with his elbows
and shoulders zale blond pale eyed
pugnacious rips at the bigger man

  zale takes the third with a furious drive
to the body four more rounds pass with
conn in front theyre coming out for
the eighth six rounds for billy only one
for tony the steel city slugger shakes
conn with a smashing mid-section attack
joe louis stirs uncomfortably not that
he doesnt wish tony zale the best of
luck but if the shorter smaller man
the complete underdog turns the tide joes
performance against billy conn will be
written off the books as a failure for the
brown bomber

  conn is aware of the excited drone of
the crowd zale is making him look foolish
indeed the pittsburgh heavyweight is
grimly determined to end this farce in the
ninth if he can knock out a two hundred
pound heavyweight like gunnar barlund
drop joe louis on his panties surely he
can better this middleweight into sub-
mission

  zale reels beneath the fury of conns
attack dont go down tony dont go
down tony he keeps repeating between
locked lips he tried gamely to fight back
as conn drives him from one side of the
ring to the other its the bell the end of
the ninth zale is still on his feet

  conn continues banging away through
the tenth eleventh tony answers conns
fury the only way he knows how with a
merciless barrage of his own a faltering but
plucky counter-attack against the bigger
man before the finish of the fight in the
twelfth zale had been on the verge of
a knockout five times as he staggered on
the canvas billy conn could not put zale
on the deck

  sheer grit determination steel stamina
and the will to fight saved tony zale his
heart-rending stubborn stand against the
bigger man tore at the crowd there
were shouts of draw draw as the
referee collected the slips purely an emo-
tional response by the mob for tony had

fight stories

won no more than three of a dozen rounds
conn charged angrily up the aisle ill
never fight a little man again he snapped
as the mob cheered tony zale to the
rafters

  both men were in uniform shortly after
zale in the navy conn in the army
tony was a petty officer first class and
on active duty for three years he never
allowed himself a chance to get out of
shape in puerto rico he headed a physi-
cal conditioning program for many months

  tony certainly had no trouble making
the grade in the navy calm cool modest
methodical and friendly that was petty
officer zale he knew how to take orders
as well as give them although tony did
no boxing for four years he insisted on
continuing as much of his training pro-
gram as possible sans gloves tony knew
it was back to the ring for him as soon
as the war ended he had a wife and a
family of his own now to care for al-
though he was the middleweight champion
tony didnt make much money out of
his hard won laurels hostak had grabbed
the lions share of the profits in their
series as a matter of fact when tony
journeyed to seattle and lifted the title
it did nothing more than pay his expenses
hostaks manager felt if zale wanted the
crown he would have to pay for it

  the abrams match wasnt the big at-
traction it should have been the conn
camp had received far more than tony
zale as billy was the big name on the
card then not tony the steel city slugger
knew he would be over thirty years of age
by the time he received his discharge that
didnt leave much time for title defenses
a boxer was definitely past his peak by
the time he hit thirty strangely enough
it was tonys post-war scraps that brought
him undying fame and fortune

in  when tony donned the gloves
again he was the forgotten champion
nobody had heard of him since the night
of the conn fight four years back in
the time zale had spent in the service
another middleweight had become promi-
nent and thats putting it mildly rocky
graziano the tousled haired gum chew-
ing swaggering fighter from the brawling

streets of new yorks tough east side
was a sensation

  graziano was everything that zale was
not one would have to search far for
two more opposite types this they had in
common both had come up the hard way
both of them terrific fighters the resem-
blance ended there had a promoter tried
to dream up a pair of opposites like zale
and graziano his product would have
borne only a pale resemblance to the real
thing

  rocky was a street corner tough ju-
venile delinquent a reform school gradu-
ate a specialist in sidewalk fist fighting and
back alley brawling if zale was made of
steel rocky was hewn from the concrete
sidewalks of new york thrown out of
school for refusing to learn and assault-
ing his teachers rocky roamed the streets
with marauding corner gangs

  while tony zale was plugging away
in the steel mills graziano was brushing
shoulders with mobsters tony fought to
get an education rocky fought just as
hard not to get one the street was where
young rocky learned the street was where
he lived graziano believed in only one
law that which his ten knuckles could
either defend or break method order
not for rocky grazianos war record was
completely the opposite of zales the
rock spent ten months in an army
prison for disobedience while tony
sweated beneath the puerto rican sun
drilling men in a physical conditioning pro-
gram

  zale was a polished boxer compared to
graziano rockys early managers were
discouraged by his right hand crazy crude-
ness and his inability to fight in any
other style but a cavemans graziano was
finally picked up by irving cohen who
managed him and taught him a few essen-
tial fine points the rock quickly dis-
carded most of them and went right back
to his primitive manner of slugging that
smashing right hand of his brought him
victory when everything else failed

  smart boxers harold green freddie
cochrane stabbed the ears off the rock
until the moment grazianos right landed
there was no arguing with that furious
right no recovering from its lethal sting
tony zale-his ring story



two welterweight champions cochrane
and servo bit the dust in rapid order when
they faced graziano terrific hitting billy
arnold crumbled before the rocks attack
these men werent beaten in the ordinary
sense they were electrocuted by grazianos
right

  in the spring of  tony zale was
the champion but one would never know
it unless he scanned the record books or
remembered the prewar hostak and
abrams clashes rocky graziano was on
everyones tongue the most talked of
fighter in the middleweight division

  tony zale was truly the forgotten man
of boxing when he signed for the graziano
fight he was an old champion thirty-two
grown rusty in the navy fans with short
memories began to ask who did he ever
beat graziano was hot copy scribes and
fans flocked to his camp graziano kayoed
his sparmates while zale trained in his
methodical unspectacular manner

  promoter mike jacobs talked of a sen-
sational  gate the fans spoke
of rocky the papers carried column after
column on the new fistic star tony zale
who was he the guy who is going to
fight graziano say zales the champ
aint he these conversations were typi-
cal wherever sportsmen gathered

  tony trained doggedly unmindful of
the huge buildup for his opponent graz-
iano was just another fighter to him tony
was aware of grazianos crashing right
but not afraid of it the fight was sched-
uled for july but destined not to come of
until september zale complained of pierc-
ing pains in his ribs trainer and mana-
gers rushed him to a doctor the medico
called it neuritis but he was only half
right the bout was cancelled and tony
returned to chicago where the neuritis at-
tack developed into pnuemonia

  the postponement only served to wet
the appetites of the fans the champion
recovered and september found both con-
testants training in stillmans gym at
different hours as zale would leave his
future opponent would come hopping up
the stairs wearing a polo shirt and trailed
by a mob of dead end looking kids tony

fight stories

glanced at the well built dark-eyed gum
chewing fighter with the tousled hair he
heard the hoarse tough voice of the chal-
lenger

  there was no sign of recognition be-
tween champion and challenger zales
cold pale eyes stared straight ahead in-
stinctively both knew they would get to
know each other soon enough it was al-
most as though they could already feel
the impending violence of their struggle

iv

september   the yankee
stadium a clear bracing autumn
night two men one blond the other
black haired stand beneath the warm glare
of lights barely listening to the warning
undertone of the referees instructions
rocky grazianos dark eyes gaze at the
canvas once in awhile he raises his head
and glances briefly at the cold steady stare
of tony zale

  alright back to your corners and come
out fighting ex-fighter and now referee
ruby goldstein says thickly never was
that phrase more unnecessary than tonight
zale watches the lights fade like twilight
around the stadium his brothers are sit-
ting out in the mob darkness johnny
wally and joe the zaleski boys from the
steel mills of gary rooting for tony
from the bottom of their hearts the steel
workers who have taken a week end off
are lost in the vast expanse of the arena
aside from his brothers and the workers
very few people believe in tony zale
very few have come to see the champion

  the talk is all graziano the odds three
to one are all graziano the big name
sportswriters crowding the ringside have
their eyes on graziano tony zale is aware
of the crowds fascination for his oppon-
ent the champion is a complete under-
dog the champion is pimply a guy stand-
ing temporarily in the way of grazianos
spectacular and certain quest for the title

  its that way at the bell when graziano
shoves out of his corner while the crowd
roar follows him into tony zale who
waits rocky graziano smashes contempt-
uously at zale no attempt at defense on
rockys part not one ounce of caution

  the punches hiss from the coiled mus-
cles of the challengers powerful sloping
shoulders they break like all the furies
on zales head and torso the champion
moves around he steps aside never back
and then all at once he matches blow for
blow with grazianos deadly power zale
is shaken his body breaks out into great
pink splotches from the challengers blows

  the crowd screams to their feet a
frenzy of excitement grips the stadium
rocky graziano head is flung back his
torso arches as the champ rockets an un-
expected right uppercut to his jaw graz-
ciano bewildered is taking the count
one    two    three    four mur-
derous anger clouds the dark eyes of the
challenger five graziano springs to his
feet with the savage speed of a jaguar
landing on a jungle path

   voices funnel into a frenzied
roar the mob is swept on the wave of
grazianos furious attack rocky would
bash zales head in with a hammer if he
had one instead his wine colored gloves
churn like leather mallets while the champ
stands his ground unflinching returning
as much as he can get through the storm
that beats his flesh against his bones

  the wild dark eyes flash before his
face leather cracks against zales head
shoulders arms even his wrists theres
no escape from the clubbing cyclone of
punches zale stands up and trades but
its a losing exchange for the champion

  the bell rings numbly in his ears

  trainer joe neidwick rubs something
cold around his neck sam pian and art
winch are talking tony zale lays his
head back against the ropes he gulps the
cool night air his legs are planted wearily
on the canvas his arms hang loosely at
his sides he usually feels this way at
the end of a long hard tough contest and
its only the second round coming up

  graziano shoots from his stool at the
bell the wild dark eyes flash before
tonys face again bludgeoning leather
booms at zale and drives him back the
champion draws deep breaths he must
stand right up to graziano he must face
up to him and trade blow for blow res-
olute grim lipped zale fires back the
fans sit at the edge of their seats the
tony zale-his ring story



smack of leather on hard muscles echoes
along the outer rows of the stadium

  tony rolls beneath the crash of graz-
ianos right the champ snorts and gulps
he can feel the tremendous animal energy
of graziano as they bump gloves and
shoulders the unceasing weighty beat of
rocks fists on his body zale squints be-
neath the lights shifting weaving tear-
ing at him thats graziano without a
vulnerable spot on his tough frame that
right uppercut in the first round was
enough to daze a horse but it only served
to pour fresh vitality into graziano

  the steel city slugger is trying desper-
ately to keep up with the challenger
boom grazianos right rams into his head
like a crow bar tony sees the lights
shiver and lurch overhead hes on the
canvas and the crowd faces begin to whirl
like a merry go round graziano is a blur
moving along the ropes the referee
counts to three tony is shaking his head
he draws his right glove in a vague ges-
ture across his blood stained mouth graz-
iano is coiled on the ropes waiting for the
champ to stagger to his feet before he
bulls in for the kill the sharp clang of
the bell stops the officials count rocky
swears and spits on the canvas

  tony flops on the green stool sam
pian speaks with a kind of rapid calm
hes excited but confident that his man
will weather the storm zales corner has
implicit faith in their man theyve seen
tony come off the deck many times in the
past hostak mamakos almost had him
but neither of them could hit like this
graziano tonys face has never been
so cut up before

  whitey bimstein taps grazianos power-
ful shoulders as the warning buzzer makes
the crowd tense this is it whitey
whispers hoarsely rocky nods zale is
scheduled to go out in this the third
round the champion is met with a two
fisted barrage he staggers and rolls be-
neath the punches graziano is turning
the knockout current on with fierce heat

  zale tells himself to fight back but his
weary arms are ridiculous weapons against
his enemys rapid-fire dynamite tony rolls
beneath crude swings and he crouches and

takes those he cant get away from he
refuses to step back or go down graziano
is punching at a shifting weary target
held up by stamina and courage alone
the zaleski boys turn away from the
ring and theyre not squeamish the crowd
is yelling stop it at referee ruby
goldstein

  the champions face is an inhuman
blood stained mask the crowd squirms
before the sickening unending chain of
grazianos punches they gaze in silent
awe as zale throws his shoulders back and
marches proudly to his corner at the bell
his battered face is held high a coldly
confident stare still in his eyes sam pian
and art winch throw their arms around
him win or lose theyve got a fighter in
their corner tonight a man any manager
can be proud of

graziano shakes his head in dis-
belief as he stares across the ring at
zale his arms are beginning to feel
weary from the hundreds of punches hes
tossed at the champion surely zale wih
not be able to weather the fourth rocky
tears out to renew the onslaught and the
plucky champion is there to pick up the
challenge some of the flame has been
taken from grazianos blows some of the
shock of his power removed through sheer
tiredness

  zale can feel the strength flow into his
body again long years of clean living
and arduous training is paying him back
in a pinch like he always knew it would

  tony brings the crowd to their feet
again with a savage rally head and body
head and body zale drives at his enemy
with short steel packed punches the
blood trickles from grazianos startled face
as the gary slugger moves in with a
vicious swinging attack the steel workers
shout themselves hoarse in the shadows of
the stadium

  the old timers are reminded of harry
greb and stanley ketchell what a match
that would have been had these two great
middleweights clashed and now the argu-
ment as to the superiority of each is being
settled in replica tonight zale is greb
graziano is ketchell for the old timers

  at the ringside damon runyon says

ill take ten to one on zale just three
short minutes later the dean of sports-
writers reverses his opinion as graziano
turns the tide again in the fifth see-saw
betting around the ringside makes the place
look like a panic on the stock exchange
one moment someone holding a fist full of
greenbacks is shouting himself hoarse for
zale only to place his money on graziano
a second later nobody knows the out-
come of this fight not even the experts
for there are no experts everybody is a
fan tonight from the gate crashers to the
silk hats

  the tide has turned completely against
zale again his fourth round rally is just
a memory he wobbles without being hit
he staggers from the breeze of grazianos
wild swings he barely makes it to his
corner and falls exhausted on his stool
only a miracle will carry his blood-flecked
body through another session

  tony is given the last rites his aching
head doused with a bucket of cold water
an ice pack placed at the base of his
brain smelling salts waved beneath his
battered nose joe neidwick kneeds his
leg muscles art winch works on his
arms sam pian pulls the elastic band of
his trunks out and makes it easier for him
to breath despite his beaten condition
a coldly frozen look of determination is
riveted in zales eyes tony isnt through
yet

  sam pian can see that maybe he can
take one more solid punch or two or
three maybe hell just go out there and
hang on to graziano until the referee stops
the fight but go out there he must sam
knows his fighter tony isnt licked until
theyve counted ten over him sam knows
it doesnt make sense but not even graz-
iano can shatter his faith in tony zale at
the bell he keeps telling the others that
tony will win youll see youll see hell
win sam repeats blindly nothing can
diminish his faith in tony zale

  the champion has barely moved from
his corner when graziano is in on him
again zale is a pitiful spectacle wobbly
legged punching back feebly with nothing
but instinct and heart to back him up the
betting is over the see-saw is coming
down at one end with graziano on top
tony zale-his ring story



tonys pale eyes narrow he stares at the
vicious curl of his enemys mouth the
square battered face of zale is impassive
suddenly with terrible energy tony zale
drives a crushing right against rockys
heart

  graziano reels hes concrete tough and
doubly dangerous when wounded zale
clips him on the head with a neat sharp
shattering left hook the challenger
bounces to a sitting position with one leg
curled beneath the other one-two-
three   

  graziano is resting  one knee his
wild dark eyes are dazed and out of focus
his bloodied lower lip hangs loosely his
arm loops through the lower rope and then
his glove reaches up uncertainly for the
top strand zale is gasping in a neutral
corner rocky clings to the topmost rope
nine-ten he pulls himself up as the
referee completes the count the ring is
thick with seconds officials and police-
men pian and winch run to zale and
hug him with delirious joy

  referee ruby goldsteins arms are
locked around graziano for a different
reason the former dead end kid is a
snarling madman he curses and beats the
air wildly with his gloves

  he fights to free himself from the offi-
cials grasp in order to get at zale again
cordon of policemen close in on him
goldstein is shouting that the fight is
over hes been counted out there is no
reasoning with the rough tough caveman
from the slums graziano has to be forc-
ibly removed from the ring

  he swaggers up the aisle red faced
angry feeling cheated and smarting under
the raw wound of his defeat  faces
stare at him and graziano is like an en-
raged bull looking for some object to vent
his fury on someone nearby cups his
hands over his mouth and shouts yellow
bum instantly graziano is ablaze he
breaks through his guard of burly police-
men while his tormentor flees towards the
bleachers the slugger from the sidewalks
calms down in his dressing room he looks
amazingly fresh as the scribes close in
on him and fire questions

fight started wasnt nothin he waves
a bandaged hand for emphasis sure it
hurt that zale can hit but this last
one   rocky tapped his hand over his
solar plexus    it took my wind he
hops from the rubbing table and grabs a
towel do i wanna fight him again
damn right i do

  the champion zale was unable to speak
with the reporters the excitement in his
dressing room reached everyone but tony
the titleholder lay stretched on a rubbing
table his swollen right hand soaking in
a bucket of ice water his eyes closed
his face nicked with cuts the doctor
kneeled over him and carefully cleaned
his mouth wounds the mob had almost
torn him apart as the police fought their
way back to his dressing room in the
space of an hour tony zale had risen
from an unpublicized champion to the
status of hero his name spoken of as often
as grazianos now no longer would they
ask who the middleweight champion was
true tony had taken a worse beating
than graziano but he had delivered the
payoff punch and won tony could re-
turn to gary now with a heart full of
pride while his wounds healed there
was a long winter of rest ahead of the
champion before he faced rocky graziano
again in the spring the zaleski family
adeline his wife and his two cute daugh-
ters mary and terry would always be
at his side the champion would forget
about his brutal struggle with graziano
the stitches in his mouth the ache in hi
swollen right hand until the spring when
he would have to remember rocky graz-
iano again

v

rocicy graziano the bad boy of

boxing bounced back into the head-
lines again shortly before his re-match with
tony zale big black ugly headlines that
half told the story of a bribe the rock
had withdrawn from a scheduled garden
clash with cowboy reuben shank the
commission approved of his withdrawal
at the time and let it go at that a month
later the headlines screamed from the
stands

grand jury probes graziano
bribe offer

  confused almost completely bewildered
by the courtroom proceedings graziano
sat between his manager and lawyer while
his case was reviewed he was placed on
the witness stand and admitted a bribe
offer to lay down for shank had been
proposed in the dressing room of a gym
some time back graziano said he didnt
know who the man was and certainly
didnt take the bribe for the fight that
never came off previously rocky had
blurted quite honestly that he might have
accepted a bribe in his earlier fighting
days had one been offered him he said
he was broke when he started out and
probably would have engaged in a fixed
fight had he been approached with enough
money

  the dark light of suspicion was cast on
rocky his brutally frank testimony didnt
help him any in a cleanup drive by the
boxing commission graziano was selected
as a number one example his dishonor-
able discharge record from the army was
given wide play

  although rocky graziano had never en-
gaged in a phony fight in his career never
taken a bribe and didnt know who the
thugs were who had propositioned him
he was banned for life by the new york
commission and its affiliates the charges
leveled against him were failure to report
a bribe at the time it happened and his
poor army record which was considered
a bad example for youthful followers of
boxing

  the proposed march st clash with
zale was driven out of the garden and
new york state the twentieth century
sporting club sought frantically for a new
site many states joined new yorks out-
lawing of graziano and for awhile it
looked as though the re-match of the
decade might never come off chicago
finally approved of the match and the
windy city was an ideal spot the champ-
ion had a huge following in chicago with
gary being right next door

  zale entered the ring as a favorite for
the only time in his series with graziano
it was a scorching summer night and the
tony zale-his ring story



fight was held indoors at the chicago
stadium the coffers of the promoters
were swelled by an enormous gate of
nearly half a million dollars fans trav-
elled from both coasts to witness the
great middleweight title battle grazianos
bad publicity had only served to increase
the publics curiosity over the second bid
of the lawless caveman from the sidewalks
of new york

  the champion stepped into the familiar
chicago ring he was instantly aware of
the terrific heat from the new suped up
lighting system the ring was like an
oven over one hundred degrees beneath
those blazing lights tony zale sat quietly
and confidently in his corner pian spoke
briefly of their ring strategy rush him
body head dont give graziano a chance
to open up and watch that right zale
nodded he winked at a friend along the
ringside mopped the perspiration from his
brow and stepped gingerly across the ring
at the bell

  tonys cold pale eyes concentrated on
the dark savage leer that twisted graz-
ianos face the challenger was dying to
get at him but he had gathered some
respect for zales hitting power since their
first clash tony hammered at his enemys
weaving body sharp short jolting
smashes that made graziano gasp the
champion rolled expertly beneath the crude
sluggers attempts to bash his blond head
in with a single crack of his right

  zale had the situation under control
the rock constantly missed fire and was
beaten off each time he tore at tony
zale was certainly a master boxer tonight
he switched to the head with ease and cut
rocky over the left eye with needling
rights tony drilled rights at the eye
until the blood flowed freely graziano
bounced energetically and awkwardly
around the ring and wiped the gore from
his eye

  as they slammed at each other during
the third stanza tony felt the unmistakable
power of grazianos blows he must dam-
age rocky cut down on that terrific power
zale hunched in with his left working
like a tigers paw silent and fast graziano
caught a shattering hook and his right

eye became discolored and swelled instant-
ly once more he plugged at zale the
savage leer still on his face

  the crowd was hypnotized by the grim
gory struggle the sweating backs of
the fighters glistened beneath the blazing
lights desperate rib aching punches echoed
around the ringside no matter who had
the edge the mob knew either one could
hit the deck at any moment zale flung a
lot of weight behind a wicked curling
right graziano buckled and struck the
canvas the fans were delirious with ex-
citement the thunder had burst

  rocky swept up from the floor at the
count of one a strange nasty gleam
clouded his wild dark eyes he grinned
at tony zale with contempt is that all
you can do chump  the words were
written on his face

  it was tony zale all the way now
hooking lefts to the head and body bear-
ing his curling right hand down on graz-
ianos battered eyes the champions torso
was drenched with sweat beneath the burn-
ing blaze of lights the heat was well
over one hundred degrees in the smoke
choked arena graziano nine years
younger than the thirty-three year old
steel city slugger seemed little affected by
it

  as the bell ended the fifth zale walked
slowly and confidently towards his corner
he lay back against the ropes and breathed
heavily he had been forcing the fight
and the pace was beginning to tell but
never for a moment did he doubt his ability
to keep pushing the match his cold pale
eyes were calm with assurance the steel
workers shouted at him to keep up the good
work from various parts of the hot arena
zale grinned inwardly the bets of the
mikes joes tonys steves and als from
the open hearth furnaces were safe gary
indiana could pull in the sidewalks to-
night and celebrate

  graziano sneered at tony as they came
out for the sixth a smoldering savage
gleam in his bruised eyes sam pian
nodded with approval as tony pumped a
steady stream of lefts at his opponents
body once again zale felt grazianos raw
strength in close and realized the chal-
lenger was far from beaten the champion

trained his fire on the battered eyes of
his enemy the tough chunky muscled
challenger rammed back with vicious lefts

  zale felt a right crash against his face
with sudden fury grazianos thumping
punches splattered him against the ropes
graziano was all over him ripping leather
through the air like a madman zales head
bounced back like a rubber ball from the
fierce jolt of grazianos rights

  the champions legs began to give
wherever he turned garziano was there
pouring a roaring niagara of leather in
his face tony began to lose consciousness
his arms dangled loosely he wobbled
along the ropes refusing to go down

  he barely heard the roar of the crowd
as graziano drove him against the ropes
the blazing lights whirled before his eyes
the canvas rocked beneath his feet the
mid-rope dug into his waist as he bent
double over it graziano slashed at him
until the referee removed the fury of the
former dead end kid

  pian and winch led tony back to his
corner the beaten champion shook his
head and mumbled something about con-
tinuing the fight rocky graziano the
conqueror was paraded around the ring
with his right hand help up the crowd
roared their approval and the beaten tony
zale was cheered as he passed along the
aisle it was hard for tony to accept de-
feat almost impossible for him to be-
lieve that graziano had licked him he
complained of the sweltering heat of the
referees hastiness in stopping the match
the scribes shrugged their shoulders at
tonys alibi graziano had broken him
with his thunder the champion was
thirty-three he was old decrepit tough
yes game to the core but unable to stand
against the youthful fury of graziano it
would be a great match another thrilling
contest if he was thrown in with graziano
again but inevitable that tony zale had
passed his peak and graziano was his
master

the defeated champion returned to
gary the steel workers his family
and his pals ever loyal welcomed him
warmly he was still their tony the kid
from the mills who had made good maybe
tony zale-his

 the rest of the country didnt believe zale
 could lick graziano in a pay-off match but
 gary was behind him perhaps more out
 of loyalty than knowledge

   tony didnt have to fight graziano
 again at last he had made enough money
 to retire on the steels mills were safely
 behind him he could buy a house in
 gary for his wife and children and live
 peacefully without ever having to go
 through the grind of gruelling ring war-
 fare again he was thirty-four now old
 for a fighter including his amateur days
 tony had been pushing leather for nearly
 eighteen years

   he had beaten several champions stood
 up to billy conn and knocked out rocky
 graziano for six years he had been the
 undisputed middleweight champion of the
 world add this to years of active service
 in the navy and you have a fighter who
 can retire on his laurels nobody would
 have called tony zale a quitter if he hadnt
 faced graziano for a third time that is
 nobody except tony zale himself

   the steel city slugger not only thought
 he could trim graziano he was positive of
 it sam pian and art winch were al-
 ways there to back his confidence some
 quarters criticized pian and winch for
 signing for a third bout anybody could
 see that tony was an aging fighter his
 nose was spread in the center the flesh
 above his eyes permanently hammered into
 twin swellings his ears were thickening
 the boyish look had long since vanished
 from his face tony zale had the marked
 features of a veteran who had been to the
 wars often and long

   when pian and winch signed for the
 rubber match with graziano they remem-
 bered what a lot of people had forgotten

 a younger cruder hitting tony zale quite
 ferocious beneath the deceptive calm of
 those cold pale eyes a tony zale who
 never quit who was dead game a fighter
 to the core of his knuckles a man who
 was always better after he had been licked

   maybe zales face had changed maybe
 he was a little older but his fierce courage
 burned as brightly as ever his skill and
 power was greater than it was even though
 his stamina might lag in a long contest

but there never could be a lengthy contest
with graziano his managers recalled
those early days with tony and remem-
bering them made them sure they were
right in sending zale in against the dreaded
power of graziano once more

  sam pian recalled those early chicago
days benny ray turning tony over to
him

  young zale quietly tough eager to
learn right hand crazy in those days
burning with an ambition to make good
as few fighters pian and winch had ever
seen hes a great kid benny had said
even if he gets licked you can be sure
hell lick the pants off his opponent in a
return go

  pian remembered that trip to youngs-
town ohio with tony the zale kid had
picked up a lot since they had taken him
over

  he had learned to put punches to-
gether in combinations and dropped his
right hand crazy stance youngstown and
a wardlow were to be the acid test for
tony wardlow was a good boxer a
puncher and a southpaw to boot pian said
nothing to tony just go in there and see
what you can do the kid from gary did
plenty he knocked out wardlow in three
rounds pian and winch were sold for
life

  the series with hostak clinched every-
thing tony coming off the canvas to
breeze through by a close decision the first
time flattening hostak in  rounds the
second time out kayoing him in  rounds
during their third clash tony zale always
improved in a series and graziano was
no exception pian and winch were sure
of that besides tony carried a memory
of grazianos savage boastful leer around
with him he hadnt forgotten the con-
tempt in the wild dark eyes either and
then there was all of gary one hundred
thirty thousand strong praying that their
boy from the steel mills would regain his
title

  they showed up in ruppert stadium
jersey city on the cool june night mark-
ing the third and final clash of the middle-
weight feudists they came in droves in
trains buses cars by planes the citizens
and steelworkers of gary

stories

vi

ten p m the ring is cleared the
announcer bellows the names of the
contestants the tournament of champ-
ions is staging the show instead of mike
jacobs if pian and winch ever wanted
to get back at uncle mike for snubbing
tony in the past this was the night to
do it

  rocky graziano bounces through the
ropes a cocky sneer on his face he
glares at zale rocky is the champion now
and he lets tony know it pian winch
ray arcel and tony zale huddle beneath
the lights as the referee speaks graziano
slices the air with anxious gloves tony
zale tenses in his corner this is the
crowning fight of his career and he knows
it he drinks deeply of the cool night
air no blazing heat to sap his strength
tonight

  he bites hard on his mouthpiece and
grinds his toes into the resin cold mur-
derous blue fire sparkles in zales eyes
the casually calm phlegmatic tony is
on edge tonight he hammers his gloves
together and waits anxiously for the bell

  the warning buzzer zale is on his
feet graziano cocksure supremely con-
fident turns his back on the gary slugger
and waves his glove at a friend the
gong zale and graziano crash head on
tony jars his enemy with a cracking left
slips beneath grazianos flailing arms and
drives him against the ropes with a relent-
less two-fisted attack rocky sneers and
slugs back zales punches are sharply
accurate grazianos somewhat wild

  zale tries for a quick kill right left to
the jaw stunning blows graziano is
dumped on the canvas he stares wild
eyed at the howling mob one minute of
the fight gone and hes taking the count
the sneer comes slowly back again tony
zale works his gloves against his trunks
and waits for rocky to come off the deck

  graziano is up at three tony zale is
the unrestrained mad puncher tonight he
hammers at rocky with a rolling shifting
overwhelming attack

  rocky graziano the king-puncher of
the middleweights cant stand up to zale
the steel city slugger drives mercilessly
tony zale-his ring story

 

for a one round kayo rocky reels and
staggers beneath the leather storm lefts
jar him to his ankles rights punch his
head back baffled hurt shocked out of
his confidence graziano strikes back
blindly agai-nst the cyclone socking zale

  the mob roar drowns out the bell nei-
ther fighters nor referee are aware that
the round had ended zale anchors a loop-
ing right beneath his opponents heart
beats him back on his heels with a rushing
attack before the referee prys them apart
and shouts the round is over

  rocky comes out smoldering for re-
venge in the next round a dark flame
burns in his eyes his teeth are bared as
he rushed zale tony beats off one at-
tack counter-punches another but the
fury of grazianos revenge cannot be de-
nied the steel city sluggers legs wobble
beneath the shattering unending wave of
gloves grimly defiantly tony sticks with
him pimch for punch shoulder to shoul-
der zale stands up to the champion and
bends but does not break

  the men in zales corner glance at each
other with assurance if tony can take
this he can take anything the sneers the
snarls the murderous assault of graziano
will be swallowed by the challenger and
hurled back at rocky in the end tony
zale is out to win or die rocky graziano
must be beaten along with the steel mills
the early set-backs the hard tough road
to the top that tony managed to master
graziano is as much a part of his past as
the present fighter rocky represents all
the obstacles that tony had to overcome
and tony zale must win or die

  back in his corner tony snaps through
parched lips ill get him in this round
the third ive got to get him arcel tells
him to take it easy be careful rocky is
always dangerous even when hes on the
canvas because he gets up twice as mad
and hits three times as hard

  the third round the session in which
tony made one of his rare boasts to
sportswriters while training the rock
will never get past the third the mob
seems to remember it as they edge for-
ward its one round apiece and one fight
apiece betting is as feverish as it was i-n

	fight stories

their first clash theres no telling which
way the tide will turn and who will beat
whom

  zale comes out with the straightest left
seen since gene tunneys day it javelins
into grazianos face and shoves him off
balance once again with the amazing
precision of a tunney tony follows quick-
ly with a bitterly sharp left hook the
kind of blow that stuns and cuts and makes
you feel that your opponent is wielding a
knife

  tony bucks his shoulders behind some
of the most vicious punches ever tossed
by a fighter each one is calculated to end
the fight each one carried enough lead to
sink a ship rocky graziano is no ordi-
nary mauler hes hurt very badly hurt
but the rugged veteran of a thousand
street brawls cannot be brought down so
easily

  zale switches to the body the crowd
spills into the aisles the partisans of
both fighters shout frantic advice at them
graziano is dazed he goes through the
motions of fighting instinctively he seeks
the ropes for protection he can hang on
the ropes he can recover on the ropes he
can come back from the ropes

  only tony zale wont let him the
gary slugger tosses everything into a
double barreled drive at the head and
body rocky is broken by the drive and
collapses on the canvas one leg rises dis-
jointedly in the air one arm is crushed
beneath his torso his eyes half closed his
mouth wide open he takes the count
five-six-seven rocky is up on his feet
again

tony pounces at the stricken cham-
pion graziano whips over a left and
leaves himself open for retaliation zale
misses nothing tonight he rockets half a
dozen beautifully timed punches at the
champion the mob howls as grazianos
legs spread wide his knees jerk and he
bounces on the canvas his arms curl
around his head the wild dark eyes are
dazed and silent

  zale moves to a neutral corner his face
impassive his eyes coldly regarding his
fallen enemy the referee sweeps his hand
over the prostrate figure of graziano with

a mournful cry of-ten and out tony
zale has succeeded in doing what only the
great stanley ketchell has ever accom-
plished the winning of the middleweight
championship from the same fighter he
lost it to

  zale is mobbed as he leaves the ring a
broad grin creases his face but there is
no gloating in the cold pale eyes as he
glances back at graziano the former
dead end kid is a real fighter to the core
and tony has respect for a guy like him-
self who came up the hard way the rock
shakes his head bitterly as he passes along
the aisle and tony knows just how he feels

  the steelworkers pour all their winning
bets into a basket one of them is elected
custodian of the pooled money and they
head for the night spots to celebrate in the
name of tony zale a huge parade was
staged in the re-crowned champions hon-
or when he returned to gary tony was
back again amongst his wife kids and
family he came home with the title and
he was happy the zaleski boys welcomed
him with iron handshakes and backslaps
the steel city slugger had earned ring im-
mortality and brought fame to gary

  nobody noticed a small item in the pa-
per that day a sports note from a euro-
pean ring a frenchman by the name of
cerdan had fought a belgium by the name
of delannoit cerdan the champion of
europe had lost an unfair decision and
was going to fight delannoit again

  cerdan licked him subsequently and not
many people noticed that either marcel
was well known in american rings he had
fought in the garden out of town he was
popular a stocky powerfully built mid-
dleweight with gold capped teeth and an
odd perpetual style of fighting coupled
with an expert left hook but how good
could this cerdan be if this delannoit had
given him trouble

  georges carpenter the old time french
light-heavyweight champ arrived with
cerdan and said zale had better watch out
chunky marcel was an exceptionally good
fighter the best france had to offer in
years the tournament of champions
wanted to know if winch and pian would
let their world champion defend his title
against cerdan winch and pian knew

tony zale-his ring story

of marcels ability and they knew tony
zales likewise still it was a risky fight
cerdan was faster hard to figure he could
make trouble tony had just completed a
gruelling series with graziano

  sure ill fight him tony said im
the champ ive got to defend iny title
he figured a champion like himself
couldnt have too many fights left in him
at the age of thirty-four the sooner he
took on this new challenger the better
winch and pian got tony  for
the match just in case tony lost he would
be well paid for the effort not that they
expected him to lose zale was a better
ringman than cerdan he liad proved him-
self against graziano while proving him-
self he had burnt a lot of energy taken a
lot of punches and he was thirty-four with
eighteen long years of glove slinging be-
hind him

  in september  tony was back in
ruppert stadium again the same ring in
which he had humbled graziano just a
few months before paul cavalier the
same referee cerdan even looked like
graziano a bit but the resemblance ended
there the frenchman was a far cleverer
boxer and certainly as rugged

 it was a cold night and sam pian
wrapped a towel around tonys blond
head to keep him warm the french boxer
and his managers had difficulty under-
standing the referees instructions cava-
lier crossed his hand impatiently along
cerdans waist to indicate the foul line
neither fighter glanced at the other

  tony shadow boxed in his corner he
was the champion the favorite he ap-
pered to be in magnificent shape although
his face showed clearly the battlemarks of
the ring the hammered flesh above the
eyes stitches webbed through his blond
brows scars around his mouth both ears
thickened tony certainly looked like the
aging tough fighter that he was

  cerdan moved deftly at the bell gloves
close to each other his body was heavy-
set brutally powerful and yet he moved
with the speed of a thin fast terribly fast
boxer in a sense there was something un-
natural about all that bulk moving with the
lithe and grace of a sleek animal zale

fight

stories

paid no attention to cerdans shifting
speed he was fighting the frenchman
not a spectator watching him cerdan let
tony do all the leading most of the fight-
ing in the early rounds

  every so often the frenchman would
break into a flurry of fast hitting vicious
counter punching curling his right strik-
ing his left with deft deadly fury tony
blinked his eyes and covered up as the
fight progresed he continued covering up
more and more he still sought the
frenchman with a jab a hook sometimes
he would risk a swinging right but mar-
cel cerdan was incredibly fast and clever
he let tony push the fight he laid back
and countered without wasting a motion
his sense of pace was constant cerdans
corner had plotted a brilliant strategy zale
would be made to -force things it had
been several years since the champion had
gone more than six rounds zale would
punch himself out while marcel waited

  the strategy of the frenchman was
precisely the opposite of grazianos he
blocked patiently led tony into false leads
countered with sparkling skill and landed
several lefts to the head

tony began breathing heavily the
fast shifting pace was beginning to
tell after a few rounds the blond bat-
tered champion wore a worried frown
marcel cerdan was damned elusive his
gloves were glued beneath his chin he
never led never indicated any move he
might make if it hadnt been for tony
zale there might not have been any fight
to speak of it was tony who forced the
openings pushed the action sought at
first with confidence now with desperation
a clean shot at cerdans jaw

  the sixth seventh eighth the fight
wore on the champion stalked and was
clouted with short heavy breath-taking
punches zale gasped and hitched up his
trunks he lunged several times and
missed always cerdan caught him with
shattering left hooks when he missed the
frenchman punched with frightening
speed not that tony was afraid but
there was just no way to get at this man
and fatigue was stabbing at his legs

  as the bout pushed into the ninth and

tenth rounds tony was too tired to try
a savage rally as he had done against
graziano besides cerdan was remark-
ably crafty he blocked skillfully with his
arms and shoulders while his poised gloves
were ready to strike at a split seconds
notice tony was very tired as the bell
sounded for the eleventh the left hooks
the hooks he never really learned to stop
were piling up against his face and made
his eyes tear and his ears ring cerdan
was a hard puncher not a one punch hitter
like graziano but a man who kept adding
one blow to another until his opponent was
subtracted

  tonys head ached he had been stag-
gered several times the breath was
knocked out of him from rattling snaking
blows to the pit of his stomach his legs
dragged over the canvas and his arms were
leaden then cerdan opened up with
everything he had the cagey frenchman
dropped depth bombs on tonys jaw in
the form of snapping left hooks and club-
bing rights that stunned the senses tony
wavered near the ropes then all the lights
went out in his brain and he was pitched
into darkness

  smelling salts ice packs and the champ-
ion came around again only to learn that
he was an ex-champion tony had col-
lapsed at the bell from sheer exhaustion
and the compilation of marcel cerdans
steady pounding the crowd gave the steel
city slugger a rousing hand for his game
stand tony took the loss of his champion-
ship philosophically he was thirty-four
battle scarred with eighteen years of ring
warfare behind him the graziano fights
had seen him at his peak the cerdan loss
had seen him sliding down that peak a
man couldnt stay on top forever

  win or lose his old pals mobbed him
when he returned to gary as tony gazed
at the reddish glow of the night sky he
knew he had won his greatest fight the
battle to stay out of the steel mills the
fight to make a better life for himself and
those who would come after him he lis-
tened to the mournful cry of the factory
whistles and he saw the steel laborers
going to work with their green lunch
pails the end of one dreary shift the
beginning of another nothing had
tony zale-his ring story



changed in gary since he was a kid and
first saw the reddish glow in the night
sky nothing had changed except tony
zale who had gone far beyond gary to
win fame and fortune in the prize-ring

  tony acting on the advice of his man-
ager his friends and many sports writers
throughout the country decided to hang up
his gloves for good the early part of this
year good luck tony

wheres the clock

    jimmy ogatty former new york
  welterweight was compelled to knock out
  his foe five times in the same round before
  being declared the victor    and his
  opponent was a light-heavy weight at that

     ogatty accomplished this amazing feat
   against young packy mcfarland at glens
   falls n y on sept   ogattys
   hard punches floored mcfarland on five
   different occasions and each time mcfar-
   land remained on the canvas for from one
   to two minutes while jack mcauliffe the
   referee paced the ring until mcfarland
   got up eventually after the fifth knock-
   down ogatty was awarded the bout but
   it was a ten minute round the longest in
   boxing history

sucker

    packey ogatty classy bantamweight
   contender of the first world zvar tells this
   story about battling levinsky

     it zvas early in  zvhen dumb dan
   morgan took battling levinsky zvorld
   light-heavyweight champion to canton
   ohio to fight a ten rounder on the train
   i asked levinsky who his opponent zvas
   the battler nonchalantly put his hand on
   my knee and grinned its some mugg
   named greb ill take him in a round or
   two packey

    on the morning of the fight while
   levinsky morgan and i were having
   breakfast in walked a chap who resembled
   a harvard freshman he was accompanied
   by his zvife a nifty looking number and
   his manager reddy mason we were then
   introduced to the sucker harry greb

     he zvas such a nice fellow i really felt
   sorry for him after my own fight on the
   same card i rushed from my dressing
   room to watch the poor kid get stiffened
   instead battling levinsky took an un-
   merciful mauling say before that fight
   zvas over i was weeping for the battler
   from that day on harry greb was in a
   class by himself
