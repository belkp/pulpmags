now millions prevent colds by twice-
a-day listerine gargle  	reduction

shoivn in tests

now people are beginning to realize that if they have
a cold they have only themselves to blame

  they are learning that ordinary colds can frequently
be prevented  their number often reduced  and
sometimes  one cold a year instead of three

           twice-a-day gargle does it
wise eating moderate exercise ample rest are half the
battle in warding off colds the other half is the system-
atic twice-a-day gargle with listerine the safe antiseptic

  for listerine by scientific tests is revealed as a
splendid aid in preventing colds and reducing their
severity and duration never have its swift germ-killing
power and safe healing action been so clearly dis-
closed below is a brief outline of one of the many
tests and its results

              one-hdlf as many colds
 persons in normal health were under medical obser-
vation for a period of one month to four and a half
months one-third of them did not gargle with lister-

ine one-third gargled twice a day one-third gargled

five times a day

  now note these results

  those who gargled with listerine twice a day had
from  to  fewer colds than those who did not
gargle with listerine

                  colds a as severe
when listerine users did contract colds they were one-
fourth as severe and lasted only one-third as lon as
the colds contracted by those who did not use listerine

  those who gargled five times a day showed even
greater resistance to infection

                 safety is answer
only a mouth wash combining the factors of swift
germicidal effect and safe healing action could accom-
plish such results physicians tell us that mouthwashes
so harsh they must be diluted before they dare be used
may and often do cause irritation through which
germs usually enter the body lambert pharmacal co

pygmy planet

by jack wiiliamson

down into rise infinitely small goes
larry on bit mission to the pygmy

puiwt

       -t-othing ever happens to
    me larry manahan
   i	grumbled under his

            breath sitting behind his
 desk at the advertising agencyi
 which employed his services in re-
 turn for the consideration of fifty
 a week all the adventure i know

it paused seeming to regard them
with malevolent eyes

 is what i see in the movies or read
 about in magazines what wouldnt
 i give for a slice of real life

   unconsciously he tensed the mus-
 cles of his six feet of lean hard
 body his crisp flame-colored hair
 seemed to bristle his blue eyes
 blazed he clenched a brown ham-
 mer of a fist

   larry felt himself an energetic
 red-blooded square peg badly af-
 flicted with the urge for adventure
 miserably wedged in a round hole
 it is one of the misfortunes of our


astounding stories

civilisation that a young man who
for example might have been an
excellent pirate a couple of cen-
turies ago must be kept chained to
a desk and that seemed to be
larrys fate

  things happen to other people
he muttered why couldnt an ad-
venture come to me

  he sat staring wistfully at a pic-
ture of a majestic mountain land-
scape soon to be used in the adver-
tising of a railway company whose
publicity was handled by his agency
when the jangle of the telephone
roused him with a start

  oh larry- came a breathless
quivering voice

  then with a click the connection
was broken

  the voice had been feminine and
had carried a familiar ring larry
tried to place it as he listened at
the receiver and attempted to get
the broken connection restored

  your party hung up and wont
answer the operator informed him

  he replaced the receiver on the
hook still seeking to follow the
thin thread of memory given him
by the familiar note in that eager
excited voice if only the girl had
spoken a few more words

then it came to him

agnes sterling he ex-
claimed aloud

  agnes sterling was a slender
elfish dark-haired girl-lovely he
had thought her on the occasions
of their few brief meetings larry
knew her as the secretary and lab-
oratory assistant of dr travis
whiting a retired college professor
known for his work on the structure
of the atom larry had called at the
home-laboratory of the savant
months before to check certain sta-
tistics to be used for advertising
purposes and had met the girl there
only a few times since had he
seen her

 now she had called him in a

voice that fairly trembled with ex-
citement-and he thought dread 
and she had been interrupted be-
fore she had time to give him any
message

  for a few seconds larry stared
at the telephone then he rose
abruptly to his feet crammed his
hat on his head and started foe
the door

  the way to find adventure is to
go after it he murmured and
this is the invitation

  it was not many minutes later
that he sprang out of a taxi at the
front of the building in which dr
travis whiting made his home and
maintained a private experimental
laboratory it was a two-story
stucco house rather out of date set
well back from the sidewalk with a
scrap of lawn and a few straggling
shrubs before it the door was
closed the windows curtained
blankly the place seemed deserted
and forbidding

  larry ran up the uneven brick
walk to the door and rang the bell
impatiently he waited a few mo-
ments no sound came from within
he felt something ominous fate-
ful about the silent mystery that
seemed to shroud the old house
for the first time it occurred to
him that agnes might be in physi-
cal danger as a result of some in-
cautious experiment on the part of
dr whiting

instinctively his hand
sought the door knob to his
surprise the door was unlocked it
swung open before him for a mo-
ment he stared hesitating into the
dark hall revealed beyond then
driven by the thought that agnes
might be in danger he advanced
impulsively

  the several doors opening into
the hall were closed the one at
the back he knew gave admittance
to the laboratory impelled by some
vague premonition he hastened to-
the pygmy planet



 ward it down the long hall and
threw it open

  as he stepped inside the room
 his foot slipped on a spot of some-
 thing red recovering his balance
 with difficulty he peered about

  bending down larry briefly ex-
 amined the red spot on which he
 had slipped it was a pool of fresh
 blood which had not yet darkened
 lying beside it crimson-splashed
 was a revolver as he picked up
 the weapon he cried out in aston-
 ishment

  something had happened to the
 gun the trigger guard was torn
 from it and the cylinder crushed
 as if in some resistless grasp the
 stock was twisted and the barrel
 bent almost into a circle the re-
 volver had been crumpled by some
 terrific force-as a soft clay model
 of it might have been broken by the
 pressure of a mans hand

  crimson shades of caesar he
 muttered and dropped the crushed
 weapon to the floor again

   his eyes swept the silent labora-
 tory

  it was a huge room taking up
 all the rear part of the house from
 the first floor to the roof gray
 daylight streamed through a sky-
 light twenty feet overhead the
 ends of the vast room were clut-
 tered with electrical and chemical
 apparatus but larrys eye was
 caught at once by a strange and
 complex device which loomed
 across from him in the center of
 the floor

 two pillars of intense light a
 ray of crimson flame and another
 of deeply violet radiance beat
 straight down from a complicated
 array of enormous oddly shaped
 electron tubes of mirrors and lenses
 and prisms of coils and whirling
 disks which reached almost to the
 roof upright a yard in diameter
 and almost a yard apart the strange
 columns of light were sharp-edged

as two transparent cylinders filled
with liquid light of ruby and of
amethyst each ray poured down
upon a circular platform of glass or
polished crystal

  hanging between those motion-
less cylinders of red and violet
light was a strange-looking green-
ish globe a round ball nearly a
yard in diameter hung between the
rays almost touching them its sur-
face was oddly splotched with
darker and lighter areas it was
spinning steadily at a low rate of
speed larry did not see what held
it up it seemed hanging free sev-
eral feet above the crystal plat-
forms

  reluctantly he withdrew his eyes
from the mysterious sphere and
looked about the room once more
no the laboratory was vacant of
human occupants no one was
hidden among the benches that were
cluttered with beakers and test
tubes and stills or among the
dynamos and transformers in the
other end of the room

  a confusion of questions beat
through larrys brain

  what danger could be haunting
this quiet laboratory was this the
blood of agnes sterling or the
scientist who employed her that was
now clotting on the floor what
terrific force had crumpled up the
revolver what had become of
agnes and dr whiting and of
whatever had attacked them had
agnes called him after the attack
or before

despite himself his attention
was drawn back to the little
globe spinning so regularly float-
ing in the air between the pillars
of red and violet flame floating
alone like a little world in space
without a visible support it might
be held up by magnetic attraction
he thought

  a tiny planet

  his mind quickened at the idea


astounding stories

and he half forgot the weird mys-
tery gathering about him he
stepped nearer the sphere it was
curiously like a miniature world
the irregular bluish areas would
be seas the green and the brown
spaces land in some parts the sur-
face appeared mistily obscured-
perhaps by masses of cloud

 larry saw an odd-looking lamp
set perhaps ten feet behind the
slowly spinning floating ball
throwing upon it a bright ray of
vividly blue light half the strange
sphere was brilliantly illuminated
by it the rest was in comparative
darkness that blue lamp it came
to larry lit the sphere as the sun
lights the earth

 nonsense he muttered its
impossible

 aroused by the seeming wonder
of it he was drawn nearer the ball
it spun rather slowly larry noted
and each rotation consumed several
seconds he could distinguish green
patches that might be forests and
thin silvery lines that looked like
rivers and broad red-brown areas
that must be deserts and the broad
blue stretches that suggested oceans

  a toy world he cried a lab-
oratory planet what an experi-
ment-

  then his eyes looking up caught
the glistening polished lens of a
powerful magnifying glass which
hung by a black ribbon from a hook
on one of the heavy steel beams
which supported the huge mass of
silently whirring apparatus

eagerly he unfastened the
magnifier holding it before
his eyes he bent toward the strange
sphere spinning steadily in the air

  suffering shades of caesar he
ejaculated

 beneath the lens a world was
racing he could see masses of viv-
idly green forest vast expanses of
bare cracked ocherous desert
wastes of smooth blue ocean

  then he was gazing at-a city
larry could not be sure that he
had seen correctly it had slipped
very swiftly beneath his lens but
he had a momentary impression of
tiny fantastic buildings clustered
in an elflike city

  a pygmy planet spinning in the
laboratory like a world in the gulf
of space what could it mean
could it be connected with the
strange call from agnes with the
blood on the floor with the strange
and ominous silence that shrouded
the deserted room

  oh larry a clear familiar
voice rang suddenly from the door
you came

  startled larry leaped back from
the tiny whirling globe and turned
to the door a girl had come si-
lently into the room it was agnes
sterling her dark hair was tangled
her small face was flushed and her
brown eyes were wide with fear
in a white hand which shook a
little she carried a small gold-
plated automatic pistol

  she ran nervously across the wide
floor to larry with relief dawning
in her eyes

 im so glad you came she
gasped panting with excitement i
started to call you on the phone
but then i was afraid it would kill
you if you came please be careful
it may come back any minute
youd better go away it just took
dr whiting

  wait a minute larry put in
just one thing at a time lets get
this straight to begin with what is
it that might kill me and that got
the doctor

  its terrible she gasped trem-
bling a monster you must go
away before it comes back

larry drew a tall stool from
beside one of the crowded
tables and placed it beside her

  dont get excited he urged
im sure everything will be all
the pygmy planet



right just sit down and tell me
about it the whole story just what
is going on here and what hap-
pened to dr whiting

  he helped her upon the stool she
looked up at him gratefully and
began to speak in a rapid voice

  you see that little planet the
monster came from that and carried
the doctor back there and i know
it will soon be back for another
victim-for sacrifice

  she had pointed across the great
room toward the strange little
globe which hung between the pil-
lars of red and violet light

  please go slow larry broke
in youre too fast for me are you
trying to tell me that that spinning
ball is really a planet

  agnes seemed a little more com-
posed though she was still flushed
and breathing rapidly her small
hand still gripped the bright auto-
matic

  yes it is a planet the pygmy
planet dr whiting called it he
said it was the great experiment of
the century you see he was testing
evolution we began with the
planet young and hot and watched
it until it is now almost as old as
mars we watched the change and
development of life upon it and
the rise and decay of a strange
civilization until now its people
are strange things with human
brains in mechanical bodies wor-
shiping a rusty machine like a
god-

  go slow larry pleaded again
i dont see- did the doctor build
-create-that planet himself
yes it began with his work on
atomic structure he discovered
that certain frequencies of the x-
ray-so powerful that they are
almost akin to the cosmic ray-have
the power of altering electronic
orbits every atom you know is a
sort of solar system with electrons
revolving about a proton

  and these rays would cause the

electrons to fall into incredibly

smaller orbits causing vast reduc-
tion in the size of the atoms and
in the size of any object which the
atoms formed they would cause
anythingliving or dead to shrink
to inconceivably microscopic di-
mensions-or restore it to its former
size depending upon the exact
wave-length used

 and time passes far more
swiftly for the tiny objects-prob-
ably because the electrons move
faster in their smaller orbits that
is what suggested to dr whiting
that he would be able to watch the
entire life of a planet in the lab-
oratory and so at first we ex-
perimented merely with solitary
specimens or colonies of animals

 but on the pygmy planet we
have watched the life of a world-
the whole panorama of evolution-

tt seems too wonderful larry
x muttered could dr whiting
actually decrease his size and be-
come a dwarf

  no trick at all agnes assured
him all you have to do is stand
in the violet beam to shrink and
move over in the red one when
you want to grow i have been sev-
eral times with dr whiting to the
pygmy planet

  been- larry stopped breath-
less with astonishment

  see the little airplane agnes
said pointing under the table

  larry gasped

  beneath the table stood a toy
airplane the spread of its glisten-
ing perfect wings was hardly thrfee
feet a wonderful delicate toy ac-
curate in every detail of propeller
motor and landing gear of brace
and rudder and aileron then he re-
alized that it was no toy at all
but a faithful miniature of a com-
mercial plane a complete tiny
copy of one of the latest single-
motor cabin monoplane models

  it looks like it would fly he
astounding stories

said a friend of mine has a big
one just like it taught me to fly
it last summer vacation this is
the very image of it

  it will fly agnes assured him
now composed enough to smile at
his amazement i have been with
the doctor to the pygmy planet in it

 you stand in the violet ray
until youre about three inches high
she explained and then get into
the plane then you fly up and into
the violet ray at the point where it
touches the planet and remain there
while you grow smaller when you
are the right size all you have to do
is drop to the surface and land to
come away you rise into the red ray
and stay in it till you grow to proper
size when you come down and land
you-youve actually done that
he gasped it sounds like a fairy
story

es ive done it she assured
him then she shuddered ap-
prehensively and the things-the
machine-monsters dr whiting
called them-have learned to do it
too one of them came down the
red ray and attacked him the doc-
tor had a gun-but what could he
do against one of those she
shivered

  it carried him back up the violet
beam just a few minutes ago i
started to phone you then i was
afraid you would be hurt-

 me hurt larry burst out
what about you here alone

  it was my business dr whiting
told me there might be danger
when he hired me

 and now what can we do
larry demanded

  i dont know she said slowly
im afraid one of the monsters
will be back after a new victim we
could smash the apparatus but it is
too wonderful to be destroyed and
besides dr whiting may have
escaped he may be alive there in
the deserts

  we might fly up in the little
plane larry proposed doubtfully
i think i could pilot it if you
want-

 the girls body stiffened her
brown eyes widened with sudden
dread and her small face went pale
she slipped quickly from the stool
drawing in her breath with a sort of
gasp the hand that gripped the
automatic trembled a little

  whats the matter larry cried

  i thought- she gasped i think
i see something in the ray the
machine-monster is coming back

  her lips tightened she lifted the
little automatic and began to shoot
into the pillar of crimson fire beside
the tiny spinning globe

 larry watching tensely saw a
curious bird-like something flut-
tering about in the red ray swiftly
growing larger

  deliberately and pausing to aim
carefully for each shot the girl
emptied the little gun at the figure
her body was rigid her small face
was firmly set though she was
breathing very fast

a curious numbness had
come over larry his only
physical sensations were the quick
hammering of his heart and a
parching dryness in his throat
terror stiffened him though he
would not have admitted it he was
paralyzed with fear

  the glittering thing that fluttered
about in the crimson ray was not
an easy target when the gun was
empty it seemed still unharmed
and its wings had increased to a
span of a foot

 too late agnes gasped why
didnt we do something

  trembling horror-stricken she
shrank toward larry

 he was staring at the thing in
the pillar of scarlet light

 it had dropped to the crystal
disk upon which the red ray fell
from the huge glowing tube above
the pygmy planet



it stood there motionless except
for the swift increase of its size

  larry gazed at it lost in fear
and wonder it was like nothing he
had ever seen what was it that
agnes had said of machine-mon-
sters of human brains in mechanical
bodies his brain reeled he
strained his eyes to distinguish the
monstrosity more clearly it was
veiled in crimson flame he could
not see it distinctly

  but suddenly when it was as tall
as himself it sprang out into the
room toward larry and the shud-
dering girl just off the crystal
disk beyond the scarlet pillar of
fire it paused for long seconds
seeming to regard them with
malevolent eyes

  for the first time larry could
see it plainly

  its body or its central part was
a tube of transparent crystal an
upright cylinder rounded at upper
and lower ends it was nearly a foot
in diameter and four feet long it
seemed filled with a luminous pur-
ple liquid

 about the cylinder were three
bands of greenish glistening metal
attached to the lower band were
four jointed legs of the same bright
green metal upon which the strange
thing stood

  set in the middle band were two
glittering polished lenses which
seemed to serve as eyes and larry
felt that they were gazing at him
with malevolent menace behind the
eyes two wings sprang from the
green band ingenious folding
wings of thin plates and bars of
green metal

 and from the upper band sprang
four slender glistening whip-like
tentacles metallic and brilliantly
green two yards in length they
writhed with strange life

it seemed a long time to larry
that the thing stood motionless
seeming to stare evilly at them with

eye-like lenses then lurching for-
ward a little it moved toward them
upon legs of green metal and now
larry saw another amazing thing
about it

  floating in the brilliant violet
liquid that filled the crystal tube
was a gray mass wrinkled and cor-
rugated this was divided by deep
clefts into right and left hemi-
spheres which in turn were sep-
arated into larger upper and smaller
lower segments white filaments
ran through the violet liquid from
its base toward the three rings or
bands of green metal that encircled
the cylinder

  in an instant larry realized that
the gray mass was a human brain
the larger upper part the cerebrum
the smaller mass at the back the
cerebellum and the white filaments
were nerves by means of which this
brain controlled its astounding
mechanical body

  a brain in a machine

 the violet liquid it came to
larry in his trance of wonder must
take the place of blood feeding the
brain-cells absorbing waste

 an eternal mind within a
machine free from the ills and
weaknesses of the body and de-
void too of any pity of any tender
feelings a cold and selfish mind
without emotion-unless it might
worship itself or its mechanical
body

 it was this monster that had
spilt the pool of blood drying on
the floor near the door and it
was these glistening green snake-
like tentacles that had crumpled
the revolver into a broken mass of
steel

 abruptly the machine-monster
darted forward running swiftly
upon its four legs of green metal
slender tentacles reached out to-
ward the shuddering girl at larrys
shoulder

 run agnes gasped to him
quickly it will kill you


astounding stories

  the girl tried to push him back

  as she touched him larry re-
covered from his daze of wonder-
ing fear agnes was in frightful
danger and facing it with quiet
courage he must find a weapon

ildly he looked about
him his eyes fell upon the
tall heavy wooden stool upon
which agnes had been sitting

  get back he shouted to her

  he snatched up the stool and
swinging it over his head sprang
toward the machine of violet-filled
crystal and glittering green metal

  stop agnes screamed in a ter-
rified voice you cant-

 she had run before him he
seized her arm and swung her back
behind him then he advanced
warily toward the machine-mon-
ster which had paused and seemed
to be regarding him with sinister in-
tentness through its glistening
crystal eye-lenses

 with all his strength larry
struck at the crystal cylinder
swinging the stool like an ax a
slender metallic green tentacle
whipped out tore the stool from
his hands and sent it crashing
across the room to splinter into
fragments on the opposite wall

  larry sent off his balance stag-
gered toward the glittering
machine as he stumbled against
the transparent tube that contained
the brain he clenched his fist to
strike futilely at it

 a snake-like metal tentacle
wrapped itself about him he was
hurled to the floor to sprawl gro-
tesquely among broken apparatus

  his head came against the leg of
a bench for a few moments he was
dazed but it seemed only a few
seconds to him before he had stag-
gered to his feet rubbing his
bruised head anxiously he peered
about the room

  the machine-monster and agnes
were gone

  he stumbled back to the mass o
apparatus in the center of the huge
laboratory intently he gazed into
the upright pillar of crimson flame
nothing was visible there

  no the other he gasped the
violet is the way they went

he turned to the companion
ray of violet radiance that
beat straight down on the opposite
side of the tiny whirling planet
and in that motionless torrent of
chill violet flame he saw them

 tiny already and swiftly
dwindling

  with green wings outspread the
machine-monster was beating swiftly
upward through the pillar of pur-
ple-blue flame and close against
the crystal tube that contained its
brain was agnes held fast by the
whip-like tentacles of glistening
green metal

  larry moved to spring after them
into the torrent of violet light but
sudden caution restrained him

  id shrink too he muttered
and then where would i be id
be standing on the glass platform
i guess and the thing flying off
over my head

 he gazed at the rapidly
dwindling forms of agnes sterling
and her amazing abductor as it
grew smaller the machine-monster
flew higher in the violet beam until
it was opposite the tiny spinning
planet

  the distance between the red and
the violet rays was just slightly
more than the diameter of the
pygmy world the sphere hung be-
tween them one side of it a frac-
tion of an inch from the red the
other as near the violet

 opposite the elfin planet the
monster ceased to climb it hung
there in the violet ray an inch from
the surface of the little world

  and still it swiftly dwindled it
was no larger than a fly and larry
could barely distinguish the form
the pygmy planet

of the girl helpless in the green
tentacles

  soon she and the monster became
a mere greenish speck    sud-
denly they were gone

for a little time he stood
watching the point where they
haxl vanished watching the red and
the violet rays that poured straight
down upon the crystal disks watch-
ing the tiny green-blue planet
spinning so steadily between the
bright rays

  abruptly he recovered from his
fascination of wonder

  what did she say he muttered
something about the monsters car-
rying off people to sacrifice to a
rusty machine that they worship
as a god it took her-for that

  he clenched his fists his lips be-
came a straight line of determina-
tion

  then i guess we try a voyage
in the little plane a slim chance
maybe- but decidedly better than
none

  he returned to the table dropped
on his knees inspected the tiny
airplane a perfect miniature deli-
cately beautiful its slim small
wings were bright as silver foil
carefully he opened the door and
peered into the diminutive cabin
two minute rifles several lilli-
putian pistols and boxes of ammu-
nition to match lay on the rear
seat of the plane

  so we are prepared for war
he remarked grinning in satisfac-
tion and the next trick i sup-
pose is to get shrunk to fit the
plane about three inches she said
lord its a queer thing to think
about

  he got to his feet walked back
to the machine in the center of the
room with its twin pillars of red
and violet flame and the tiny world
floating between them he started
to step into the violet ray then
hesitated shivering involuntarily

like a swimmer about to dive into
icy cold water

  turning back to one of tlie
benches he picked up a woodea
funnel-rack and tossed it to the
crystal disk beneath the violet ray
slowly it decreased in size until
it had vanished from sight

  safe i suppose he muttered
but how do i know when im
small enough

after a moment he picked up
a glass bottle which measured
about three inches in height set it on
the floor beside the crystal disk

  i dive out when i get to be the
size of the bottle he murmured

  with that he leaped into the violet
beam

  he felt no unusual sensation ex-
cept one of pleasant tingling
warmth as if the direct rays of the
sun were beating down upon him
for a moment he feared that his
size was not being affected then
he noticed not that he appeared
to become smaller but that the lab-
oratory seemed to be growing im-
mensely larger

  the walls seemed to race away
from him the green-blue sphere of
the tiny planet which he proposed
to visit expanded and drew away
above his head

  abruptly fearful alarmed at the
hugeness of the room he turned
to look at the bottle he had placed
to serve as a standard of size it
had grown with everything else
until it seemed to be about three
feet high

  and it was swiftly expanding it
reached to the level of his shoul-
der and higher

  he ran to the edge of the crystal
disk which now seemed a floor
many yards across and leaped from
its edge it was a dozen steps to
where he had left the bottle and
it was as tall as himself

  he started across the floor of the
laboratory toward the table under


astounding stories

which the toy plane stood the in-
credible immensity of his sur-
roundings awed him strangely the
walls of the room seemed distant
cyclopean cliffs the roof was like
a sky table legs towered up like
enormous columns

  it seemed a hundred yards across
the strangely rough floor to the
plane as he drew near it it gave
him huge satisfaction to see that it
was of normal size correctly pro-
portioned to his own dimensions

  great luck he muttered that
i can fly

he paused as- he reached the
cabins open door to wonder at
the astounding fact that a little
while ago he had opened that door
with a hand larger than his entire
body now was

  i guess this is my day of won-
ders he muttered allah knows
i had to wait long enough for it

  first he examined the weapons in
the cabin there were two heavy
sporting rifles and two  auto-
matics there were also two smaller
automatics which he supposed had
been intended for agnes use and
there was abundant ammunition

  then he inspected the plane it
looked to be in excellent condition
in every way the gasoline and oil
tanks were full

  he set about starting the motor
using the planes inertia starter
which was driven by an electric
motor soon the engine coughed
sputtered and gave rise to a roar-
ing rhythmic note that larry found
musical

 when the motor was warm he
opened the throttle and taxied out
from beneath the colossal table and
across the laboratory floor toward
the titanic mechanism in the cen-
ter of the room the disk of crystal
was set almost flush with the floor
its edge beveled the plane rolled
easily upon it and out into the
cyclopean pillar of violet flame

  once more larry felt the sen
sation that everything about him
except the plane itself was expand-
ing inconceivably in size soon the
laboratorys walls and roof were
lost in hazy blue distance he could
distinguish only the broad bright
field formed by the surface of the
crystal disk with the floor strefsft-
ing away beyond it like a vast
plain and above the green-blue
sphere of the tiny planet bright
on one side and dark on the other
so that it looked like a half-moon
immensely far-off

as he waited he noticed a
curious little dial in a lower
corner of the instrument board
which he had not seen at first one
end of its graduated scale was
marked earth normal the other
pygmy planet normal a tiny
black needle was creeping slowly
across the scale toward pygmy
planet normal

  thats how we tell what size we
are without having to look at a
botfrle he muttered

  when the area of the crystal
platform appeared to be about half
a square mile he decided that he
would now have sufficient space to
spiral up the violet ray toward the
planet if he waited too long to
start the distance would become
impossibly great

  he gave the little plane the gun
the motor thundered a throbbing
song the ship rolled smoothly for-
ward over the polished surface
gained flying speed and took the air
without a shock

  feels good to hold the stick
again larry murmured

  making small circles to keep
within the upright pillar of violet
radiance he climbed steadily and
as rapidly as possible keeping his
eyes upon the brilliant half-moon
of the pygmy planet

  the strangest flight in the an-
nals of aviation he was flying
the pygmy planet



toward a goal that a few minutes
before he could have touched to-
ward a goal that at the beginning
of his flight was only a few lengths
of his plane away and his size
dwindled so rapidly as he flew that
the planet seemed to swell and draw
away from him

 as larry and the plane grew
smaller the relative size of the
violet ray increased so there was
no longer much danger of flying
out of it it seemed that he flew
through a world of violet flame

 he met a curious problem in
time it is evident that time passes
faster for a small animal than for
a large one because nerve currents
require a shorter time in transit and
all thought and action is conse-
quently speeded up it took a hun-
dred-foot dinosaur nearly a sec-
ond to know that his tail had been
pinched a fly can get under way
in time to escape a descending
swatter the pygmy planet rotated
in a few seconds of earth time
one of its inhabitants might have
lived aged and died in the dura-
tion of a single day in our larger
world

so larry found that time seemed
to pass more rapidly or rather
that the time of the world he had
left appeared to move more slowly
as he adventured into smallness
he had been flying it seemed to
him nearly an hour when he
reached the level of the planets
equator

  now it seemed a vast world fill-
ing half the visible universe he
flew toward it steadily until he
knew by the fading before him of
the violet flame which now seemed
to fill all space that he was near
the edge of the ray and as he flew
be watched the little scale upon
which the black needle was now
caring the line marked pygmy
planet normal

 circling slowly keeping always

on the level of the planets equator
and near the edge of the violet ry
so as to be as close as possible to
his landing place when he reached
the proper size he watched the
creeping black needle

 too he scanned with eager eyes
the planet floating before him bare
red deserts narrow strips of green
vegetation shrunken blue oceans
silvery lines of rivers passed in
fascinating panorama beneath his
eyes the rate of the planets
spinning seemed continually to
lessen with the changing of his
own sense of time

  agnes larry thought of her with
a curious eager pain in his heart
she was somewhere on that strange
ancient world a prisoner of weird
machine-monsters intended victim
of a grotesque sacrificial ceremony

 could he find her in the vast-
ness of an unfamiliar world and
having found her would there be
a chance to rescue her from her
hideous captors the project
seemed insane but larry felt a
queer unfamiliar urge which he
knew would drive him on until he
had discovered and saved her-or
until he was dead

at last when it seemed to
larry nearly three hours
since he had begun this amazing
flight the crawling ebon needle
reached the mark pygmy planet
normal

  he flew out of the wall of violet
flame toward the planets surface
before the distance between the
planet and the rays edge had
seemed only the fraction of an inch
now it appeared to be many miles

 abruptly the pygmy planet
which had seemed to be beside him
appeared to swing about so that
it was beneath him he knew that
it was a change merely in his sen-
sations he was feeling the gravi-
tation of the new world it was
pulling him toward it
astounding stories

  he cat the throttle and settled
the plane into a long glide a glide
that was to end upon the surface of
a new planet

  in what seemed half an hour
more larry had made a safe land-
ing upon the pygmy planet he
had come down upon a stretch of
fairly smooth red sandy desert
which seemed to stretch inimitably
toward the rising sun which direc-
tion larry instinctively termed
east

  to the west was a line of dull
green-evidently the vegetation
along a stream the ocher desert
was scattered with sparse clumps
of reddish spiky scrub larry
taxied the plane into one of those
thickets finding canvas and rope
in the cabin he staked down the
machine and muffled the motor

  then selecting a rifle and a heavy
automatic from the weapons in the
cabin and filling his pockets with
extra ammunition he left the plane
and set out with brisk steps toward
the green line of vegetation

  ill follow along the river he
reasoned it may lead me some-
where and it will show the way
back to the plane i may come
across something in the way of a
clue cant go exploring by air or
ill burn up all the gas and be
stranded here

to his surprise the water course
proved to be an ancient canal
walled with crumbling masonry its
channel was choked with mud and
thorny thick-leaved desert shrubs
of unfamiliar variety but a feeble
current still flowed along it

  after some reflection larry set
out along the banks of the canal

  he followed it for two days

  curious straight bars of light
were visible across the sky-a band
of violet in the morning one of
crimson at evening their apparent
motion was in the same direction
as that of the sun the bars of light

puzzled him considerably before it
occurred to him that they must be
the red and violet rays

  so you wait till evening and
then fly up into the red ray to go
home he muttered but i may
not need that information he add-
ed grimly seems to be a pretty
big job to search a planet on foot
for one person and im not ging
back without agnes

  in the afternoon of the second
day he came within view of a city
he could discern vast imposing
walls and towers of dark stone it
stood in the barren red desert far
back from the green line of the old
canal larry left the canal and
started wearily across toward it he
had covered several miles of the
distance before he saw that the
lofty towers were falling the mag-
nificent walls crumbling the city
was ruined dead deserted

  the realization brought him a
great flood of despair he had hoped
to find people-friends from whom
he might get food and information
about this unfamiliar planet but
the city was dead

  larry was standing there in the
midst of the vast red plain be-
tween ruined city and ruined canal
tired hungry lonely and hopeless
he was looking up at the white
sun trying to comfort himself
with the thought that the brilliant
luminary was merely a queer blue
lamp that he was upon a tiny ex-
perimental world in a laboratory
but the thought brought him no
relief only confusion and a sense
of incredulity

then he saw the machine-mon-
ster

  a glittering winged thing of
crystal and green metal identical
with the one he had encountered
in the laboratory it must already
have seen him for it was dropping
swiftly toward him

  larry started to run took a few
the pygmy planet



staggering steps then he recalled
the heavy rifle slung over his
shoulder moving with desperate
haste he got it into his hands and
raised it just as the monster
dropped to the red sand a dozen
yards away from him

  steadily he covered the crystal
cylinder within which the things
brain floated in luminous violet
liquid his finger tightened on the
trigger ready to send a heavy bullet
crashing into it then he paused
swore softly lowered the gun

  if i kill it he murmured i
may never find agnes and if i
let it carry me off it may take
me where she is

  he walked toward the monster
across the red sand

  it stood uncertainly upon green
metal legs seeming to stare at him
strangely with eye-like lenses its
wings of thin green metal plates
were folded its four green ten-
tacles were twitching oddly

  abruptly it sprang upon him

  a green tentacle seized the rifle
and snatched it from his hands he
felt the automatic pistol and the
ammunition being removed from his
pockets

  then firmly held in the flexible
arms of green metal he was lifted
against the cylinder of violet liquid
the monster spread its broad
emerald wings and larry was
swiftly borne into the air

  in a few moments the wide ruins
of the ancient city were spread be-
low with the green line of the
choked canal cutting the infinite
red waste of the desert beyond it

  the monster flew westward

for a considerable time noth-
ing save barren ocherous
desert was in view then larrys
weird captor flew near a strange
city a city of green metal the
buildings were most fantastic-
pyramids of green crowned with
enormous glistening spheres of

emerald metal an impassable wall
surrounding the city

  larry had expected the monster
to drop into the city but it carried
him on and finally settled to the
ground several miles beyond the
green tentacles released him as the
thing landed and he sprawled be-
side it dizzy after his strange flight

  as larry staggered uncertainly
to his feet he saw that the mon-
ster had released him in an open
pen it was a square area nearly
fifty yards on each side and fenced
with thin posts or rods of green
metal perhaps twenty feet high set
very close together and sharply
pointed at the top they formed
a barrier apparently insurmountable

  in the center of the pen was a
huge and strange machine built of
green metal it looked very worn
and ancient it was covered with
patches of bluish rust or corrosion
at first it looked quite strange to
larry then he was struck by a
vaguely familiar quality about it
looking closer he realized that it
was a colossal steam hammer

  its design of course was unfa-
miliar but in the vast corroded
frame he quickly picked out a steam
chest cylinder and the great ham-
mer weighing many tons

  he gasped when his eyes went to
the anvil

  a man was chained across it

  a man in torn grimy clothing
fastened with fetters of green metal
upon wrists and ankles so that his
body was stretched beneath the
massive hammer he seemed to be
unconscious upon his head which
was turned toward larry was a red
and swollen bruise

  the monster which had dropped
larry within the pen rose again
into the air and larry started for-
ward trying to remember just what
agnes had told him of a machine to
which the monsters sacrificed

  this must be the machine-this
ancient steam hammer


astounding stories

 as he moved forward agnes
came into view

she walked around the massive
base of the great machine
carrying a bowl filled with a fra-
grant brown liquid she stopped at
sight of larry and uttered a little
cry the bowl fell from her hands
and the fragrant liquid splashed
out on the ground her brown eyes
went wide with delighted surprise
then a look of pain came into them

  larry larry she cried why
did you come

  to get you he answered try-
ing to speak as lightly as he could
and the best way i knew to find
you was to let one of the monsters
bring me cheer up but even to
himself his voice had a tone of
discouragement

  she smiled wanly i dont see
anything to be cheerful about her
small face was set and a little white
dr whiting is going to be
smashed under the hammer of this
dreadful machine whenever the
steam is up then it is my turn
and yours thats nothing to laugh
about

 but we arent smashed yet
larry insisted

 by the way what was that
in the bowl he went on glancing
down i forgot to bring lunch
he grinned

  she looked down startled

  oh dr whitings soup poor
fellow im afraid hell never awake
to eat it theres plenty more come
around here

  she picked up the bowl and led
him around the base of the
machine then she filled the bowl
again with the fragrant red-brown
liquid from a tall urn of green
metal larry took the dish eagerly
and gulped down the rather insipid
and tasteless food

  and the monsters worship this
old steam hammer he inquired
when his hunger was appeased

  yes i think the thing is worked
by steam generated by volcanic heat
anyhow there isnt any boiler and
the steam pipe comes up out of
the ground you can see that so
it runs on without any attention-
though i guess the heat is dying
down since it is several days be-
tween blows of the hammer

 and i guess the monsters have
forgotten how they used  rule
machines they seem to have de-
pended upon machines even giving
up their own bodies for mechanical
ones until the machine rules them

 and when this old hammer kept
pounding on through the ages
using volcanic steam i guess they
got to considering it alive they
began to regard it as a sort of god-
and when they got the idea of
giving it sacrifices it was natural
enough to place the victims under
the hammer

they went back to dr whiting
who was chained across the
anvil he was still breathing but
unconscious he had been injured in
a struggle with the monsters and
his body was much emaciated
agnes explained that he had been
a prisoner in the pen for many
months of the time of this world
waiting his turn to die she said
that the monsters had just com-
pleted the extermination of another
race upon the pygmy planet and
were just turning to the greater
world for victims

  larry noticed that the great ham-
mer was slowly rising in its guides
as the pressure of the steam from
the planets interior increased in
a few hours-just at sunset-it
reached the top of its stroke

 the air above the pen was sud-
denly filled with glittering swarms
of the green-winged monsters
sweeping slowly about in meas-
ured hight with strange order in
their masses they had come to wit-
ness the sacrifice
the pygmy planet



  with an explosive rush of steam
the hammer came down

  the ground trembled beneath the
terrific blow the roaring of
escaping steam and the crash of the
impact were almost deafening a
heavy white cloud shrouded the cor-
roded green machine

  when the hammer slowly lifted
only a red smear was left   

  agnes had shrunk trembling
against larrys shoulder he had
put his arms about her and was
holding her almost fiercely

  my turn next she whispered
and dont try to fight them it
will only make them hurt you

  i cant let them take you agnes
larry cried in an agonized tone
and the words seemed to leap out
of themselves because i love
you

  you do agnes cried in a thin
choking voice pressing herself
against him ever since the first
time you came to the laboratory-

  a score of the monster forms of
violet-filled crystal and gleaming
green metal had dropped into the
pen they tore agnes from larrys
arms hurling him roughly to the
froand at the bottom of the green
weal fence for some time he was

txthen he had staggered pain-
vv fully to his feet it was
night the monsters were gone the
starless sky was black and empty

calling out weakly and stumbling
about the pen he found agnes she
was gained where dr whiting had
been

  she was conscious unharmed for
a time they talked a little ex-
changing broken incoherent
phrases then they went to sleep
lying on the anvil beneath that
mighty hammer that was slowly
lifting to strike another fearful
blow

  when the sun had risen again
larry brought agnes some of the

brown soup from the metal urn
which had been filled again then
when he had satisfied himself he
started clambering up the massive
frame of the hammer

  if he could put it out of com-
mission 

  it was a difficult task he slipped
back many times and finally had
to choose another place to make the
ascent twice he slipped and almost
fell from a considerable height but
finally he reached the massive wheel
of the valve which seemed to con-
trol the admission of steam into the
cylinder above the hammer

  if he could but close that the
steam would be confined in the
chest below and when the pressure
reached a certain point something
should happen

  the valve was not easy to turn
it seemed fixed with the corrosion
of ages for hours larry wrestled
with it then he left it realizing
that he must find something to use
for a hammer a vigorous search
of the pens hard earth floor failed
to reveal any stone that would do
he turned his  attention to the
machine and presently saw a
slender projecting lever high up
on the side of the vast frame which
looked as if it had been weakened
by corrosion after a perilous climb
be reached the bar of green metal
and swung his weight upon it it
broke and he plunged to the gtound
with the har in his hands

clambering up once more to
the great valve he hammered
it until the rust that stiffened it
was loosened then he struggled
with the valve until it was closed

 well see what happens he
muttered

  returning to the ground he set
to work to break the green metal
fetters upon agnes wrists and
ankles using the broken lever as
hammer and file

  for the greater part of six days


astounding stories

he toiled at that task while the
great hammer rose slowly but the
green metal seemed very hard one
arm was free at the end of the sec-
ond day the other on the fourth
he had one ankle loose on the
morning of the sixth day but as
evening came on and the great
hammer reached the top of its
stroke the fourth chain still defied
him

  before sunset a swarm of the
monsters appeared wheeling on
green wings he was forced to leave
the work hiding his improvised
file

  agnes still lay across the anvil
to conceal from the monsters the
fact that the chains were broken
larry sat close beside her nursing
hands that were blistered and sore
from his days of filing at the chains

  a sudden clatter came from the
huge mechanism above them and
a sharp hiss of steam which became
louder

  it works larry whispered to
agnes the old valve held and
the steam cant get into the cylinder
to smash us but allah knows what
will happen when the pressure rises
in that old steam chest

  darkness came dusk swallowed
the wheeling machine-monsters all
night larry and agnes waited si-
lently together on the great anvil
listening to the hissing of steam
from above which was slowly be-
coming a shrill monotonous scream
monotonous always higher shriller

  the sun rose again still the
green-winged monsters wheeled
about they came in glittering
swarms thousands of them they
came nearer the machine now and
flew about more swiftly as if ex-
cited

hen it happened

  there was a roar like thun-
der and a colossal bellowing ex-
plosion the air was filled suddenly
with scalding steam and with

screaming fragments of the burst-
ing steam chest in the midst of it
all larry felt a crushing blow upon
the head and a blanket of darkness
fell upon him   

  the monstersare all gone dar-
ling agnes ice reached him
as though they were very much
frightened and a piece of the old
hammer hit the fence and knocked
a hole in it you must go leave
me-

  leave you larry groaned
struggling to sit up not a bit of
it he touched his head gingerly
felt a swollen bruise

  collecting a few fragments of the
wrecked machine to serve as tools
he fell to work again upon agnes
remaining chain already he had cut
a deep groove in it two hours
later it was broken

  carrying the metal urn of brown-
ish liquid they crept out through
the hole in the fence which had
been torn by the flying fragment
of a broken casting of green metal
they left the wreck of the machine
which a strange race had wor-
shiped as a bloody god and hurried
furtively into the desert of red sand

  making a wide circuit about the
fantastic city of green metal which
larry had seen from the air they
struck out eastward across the des-
olate ocherous waste the food in i
the urn eaten sparingly lasted until
the end of the eighth day	t

  on the morning of the ninth they 
came in view of the green line of 
the ancient canal it was hours 
later that they staggered weakly 
over its wall of crumbling masonry j
clambered down into the muddy 
weed-grown channel and drank j
thirstily of green tepid water

  larry found his old trail beyond
the canal they followed it back

in the middle of the afternoon they
stumbled up to the thicket of spiky
desert growth in which larry had
hidden the plane	j

  the machine was undamaged
u - - -

jd moved the stake ropes slipped
the canvas cover from the motor
turned the plane around inspected
it and examined the strip of
anaooth hard red sand upon which
be had landed

   agnes pointed out the dim band
of crimson across the sky from
north to south slowly rising to-
ward the zenith

   thats the red ray she said
j we fly into it

  and a happy moment when we
do larry rejoined

   he roused the motor to life

 as the bar of crimson light
 neared the zenith the plane rolled
j forward across the sand and took
 off climbing steeply larry anx-
 iously watched the approach of
the red band the gravitation of the
pygmy planet seemed to diminish
as he gained altitude until pres-
ently he could fly vertically from
it without circling at all he set
i the bow toward the scarlet bar

  across the sky before him

and suddenly he was flying
through ruby flame

   his eyes went to the little scale
 at the corner of the instrument
 board he saw the little ebon
 needle waver leave the mark desig-
 nated pygmy planet normal and
 start toward earth normal

   for what seemed a long time he
was wheeling down the crimson ray
a few times he looked back at
agnes in the rear seat she had
gone to sleep

   then a vast circular field was
below-the crystal platform

   larry landed the plane upon it
taxied to the center and stopped
there with the motor idling the
laboratory taking shape in the blue
abyss about him seemed tocontract
swiftly

presently the plane covered
most of the crystal disk he
jtaxied quickly off stopped on the



 floor nearby and cut the ignition
 agnes woke together they clam-
 bered from the planes cabin and
 walked back into the crimson ray

  once more the vast spaces of the
room seemed to shrink until it
looked familiar once more the
pygmy planet and the huge
machine looming over them
dwindled to natural size

  agnes watching a scale on the
frame of the mechanism which
larry had not noticed leaped sud-
denly from the red ray drawing
him with her

  we dont want to be giants
she laughed

  larry drew a deep breath and
looked about him once more he
was in his own world and survey-
ing it in his normal size he be-
came aware of agnes standing close
against him he suddenly took her
in his arms and kissed her

  wait a minute she objected
slipping quickly from his arms
what are we going to do about
the pygmy planet those monsters
might come again even if you did
wreck their god and dr whiting
poor fellow- but we mustnt let
those monsters come back

  larry doubled up a brown fist and
drove it with all his strength
against the little globe that spun so
steadily between the twin upright
cylinders of crimson and of violet
flame his hand went deep into it
and it swung from its position
hung unsteadily a moment and then
crashed to the laboratory floor it
was crushed like a ball of soft
brown mud it spattered

  now i guess they wont come
back agnes said a pity to spoil
all dr whitings work though
larry was standing motionless
holding up his fist and looking at it
oddly i smashed a planet think
of it i smashed a planet just the
other--why it was just this eve-
ning at the office i was wishing for
something to happen

you can take what
they tell you

once more gregg anita snap and

venza are united in high peril-

this time in the van of earths de-

about any danger or trouble and
cut it in half and even then youll
be on the gloomy side see here
gregg haljan-

  im not giving you newscasters
blare i retorted venzas extrava-
gant vehemence was always refresh-
ing the venus girl as different
from anita as venus is from the
earth sat and glared at me i
added anita mentioned news-
casters i didnt

 anita was i
no mood for
smiling tell us
gregg she sat
upright and tense
in the big metal-

framed upholstered chair with her
knees drawn up under a dark
red skirt and her chin cupped in
her hands tell us

 for a fact they dont know
much about it yet i resumed a
placet-you can call it that a
wanderer-

  i should say it was a wanderer
venza exclaimed coming from
heaven knows where beyond the
stars-swimming in here like a
comet

  they calculated its distance yes-
terday at some sixty-five million
miles from earth i said it isnt
so far beyond the orbit of mars
coming diagonally and heading
very nearly for the sun but its
not a comet its not rational

the thing was indeed inex-
plicable for many weeks now
astronomers had been studying it
this was early summer of the year
 ad we had all of us only
recently returned from those ex-
traordinary incidents which i have
already recounted when very near-
ly we lost the radium treasure of
johnny grantline on the moon
and very nearly lost our lives as
well my ship the planetara which
in the astronomical seasons when
the earth mars and venus were
within comfortable traveling dis-
tances of each other carried mail
and passengers from great-new
york to ferrok-shahn of the mar-
tian union and to grebbar of the
venus free state-that ship was

here it is gentlemen and this time if we can make it speak-
 

astounding stories

wrecked now upon the moon

  i had been an under navigating
officer o the planetara upon her
i had met anita prince whose
brother and only relative now was
dead and anita and i were soon to
marry

  i was waiting now in great-
new york upon the decision of
the line officials regarding another
space-flyer perhaps i would have
command of it since captain car-
ter of the planetara had been
killed certainly anita and i hoped
so

   and then in april of  this
mysterious visitor from interstellar
space appeared upon our astro-
nomical horizon a little thing at
first-a mere unusual dot a pin-
point on a photo-electric star-
diagram which should not have
ibeen there it occasioned no com-
ment at first save that the astrono-
mers thought it might be another
lost outpost beyond pluto belong-
ing to our solar system

  then presently they saw it was
not that for it was coming in
with the great curve of an elon-
gated elipse coming at tremen-
dous speed it daily changed its
aspect gathering velocity until
soon it was not a dot but a streak
on every diagram-plate

   in a week or so the thing passed
from a mere technical astronomical
curiosity to an item of public news
and now early in june when it
had cut through the orbit of jupi-
ter and was approaching that of
mars the people of all our three
inhabited worlds were in a fever
of curiosity and fear was grow-
ing the visitor was a menace
no astronomical body with a mass
as great as a fifth of the moon
could come among us without caus-
ing trouble-or disaster perhaps
the newscasters with a ready skill
for lurid possibilities were blar-

ing all sorts of horrible events
impending

yet for once the newscasters
were short of a horrible ac-
tuality this wanderer as they
called the oncoming little planet
was destined to plunge the earth
venus and mars into a turmoil un-
precedented in the recorded his-
tory of any of the three worlds
we could not guess it but we
were upon the brink of a new war-
fare interplanetary no longer this
was interstellar from realms so
remote that our mail-ships from
venus and mars were like chil-
drens toys flying over a grassy
country -lawn this wanderer was
coming with a new and almost in-
conceivably terrible menace well
for us that the martian union the
venus free state and the usw
were in an alliance of friendly
amiability with all our interplane-
tary differences adjusted we had
need of that alliance now for
standing alone any one of our
worlds would have been destroyed

  but this evening in early june
as anita venza and i were seated
in anitas home in the northern
residential area of great-new york
beyond the terraced confines of
the roaming metal city we had no
more than a premonition of these
dire events

  i told the girls all i knew of
the approaching wanderer  the
density was similar to that of our
earth the oncoming velocity and
the calculated elements of its orbit
now were such that within a few
weeks more the new planet would
round our sun and presumably
head outward again it would pass
within a few million miles of us
causing perhaps a disturbance to
our own orbit possibly even a
change of the inclination of our
axis affecting our tides our cli-

   an account of these incidents was given by gregg haljan in brigands of the
moon which appeared in the march  issue of astounding stories
wandl the invader



t-bringing abnormality and
disturbance in a thousand -ways

  all this was understandable but
there were many things which were
not

qto ive heard venza inter-
im rupted me they say that
and then they stop why cant a
newscaster tell you what is so mys-
terious

 for a very good reason venza
because the government holds it
back you cant throw people into
a panic this whole thing up to
to-day has been withheld from
the earth and the venus publics
the martian union tried to with-
hold it but could not every helio-
giram between the worlds is cen-
sored

 and still said venza sarcas-
tically you dont tell us what is
so mysterious about this wanderer
for one thing i said it
changes its direction no rational
heavenly body does tttiat they cal-
culated the elements of its orbit
way back last april theyve done
it twenty times since and every
time the projected orbit is dif-
ferent just a little at first so
that it could have been the mathe-
maticians error but last week the
accursed thing actually took a sud-
den turn as though it were a space-
ship

 the girls stared at me what
does that mean anita asked fi-
nally

 i shrugged theyre beginning
to make wild guesses-we wont go
into that

 it was far from me to frighten
these two girls i had that feeling
now but within a few hours i was
forced to abandon it

 what else mysterious venza
demanded

 the thing isnt normally vis-
ible

  venza shifted her silik-sheathed
legs don t talk in code

  not normally visible i repeat-
ed a world one-fifth as large as
the moon could be seen plainly
by our electrotelescopes when well
beyond piluto its now between
jupiter and mars invisible to the
naked eye of course but still its
not very far away-ive been out
there myself with instruments we
ought to be able to see its sur-
face see whether it has land and
water-inhabitants perhaps you
should be able to distinguish an
object on its surface as large as a
city-but you cant

  why not asked anita be-
cause there are clouds it has an
atmosphere

hey dont even know that
i retorted there is some-
thing abnormal about the light-
waves coming from it not exactly
blurred but a distortion a fading
its obviously some aberration
some abnormality of the light-
waves so that our telescopes can
almost but not quite distinguish
the details even the spectrohelio-
graph operates abnormally hydro-
gen photo-diagrams with stereo-
scopic lenses and wave-length se-
lection should give a surface depth
of vision

  cannot you say it in anglo-
saxon gregg venza frowned

  i mean the thing should not
look like a flat disc you ought to
be able to tell a mountain height
from a valley but you cant noth-
ing works normally everything is
weird-

  a swift rapping on our door-grid
interrupted me and snap dean
burst in upon us

  hola-lo everybody is it a con-
ference you look so solemn

 he dashed across the room
kissed venza pretended that he
was about to kiss anita and winked
at me as always snap lunged
upon us with an energy liike a
battery supercharged he warn

dynamic litle fellow small wiry
ted-headed and freckle-faced and
had been the radio-helio operator
of the ill-fated planetaia under
almost every adverse circumstance
-and heaven knows he and i had
seen enough of them together-he
could muster a quick ready laugh
and the kind of wit that made
everyone like him certainly he
was a perfect match for venza
for all the millions of miles which
separated their native lands venza
too was small and slim her man-
ner as readily jocular as his and
she had a feminine irony with
which even snap could not cope

 and where have you been
venza demanded

  me my private life is my own
-so far were not married yet
since you insist on us going to
grebbar for the ceremony

  stop it protested anita weve
been talking of-

 i know very well what youve
ibeen talking about everybody is
ive got news for you gregg he
went abruptly solemn and lowered
his voice halsey wants to see us
right away-this evening

i regarded him blankly and
my mind swept back no more
than a few short weeks ago de-
tective-colonel halsey of division-
al headquarters here in great-new
yorik had sent for us and we had
been precipitated into many dire
events was this a meaningless co-
incidence or an omen

  halsey i burst out

  easy gregg snap cast a vague
look around anitas draped apart-
ment an open window was beside
us leading to a tiny catwalk bal-
cony it was moonlit now and two
hundred feet above the pedestrian
viaduct

  but snap frowned at it easy
i tell you why shout about hal-
sey the air can have ears upon
occasion

  venza moved and closed the win-
dow

  what is it i asked more
softly

  but snap was not satisfied
anita have you got an isolation
barrage for this room

  of course i havent snap

  well you never can tell it
seems to me that anyone who even
speaks to halsey is cursed with
eavesdroppers and ive just had
his office on the audiphone gregg
have you got a detector with you
mine is out of order

  i had none snap produced his
little coil and indicator dial

 shove me over that chair
gregg

  he was resourceful he discon-
nected one of the rooms tube-
lights and contacted with the
cathode it was a makeshift method
at best but as he dropped to the
floor uncoiling a little length of
his wire for an external pick-up
we saw that the thing worked
the pointer on the dial-face was
swaying

  gregg look at that didnt i
tell you

the pointer quivered prised
with a positive reaction an
eavesdropping ray of some sort
was upon us

  anita gasped good lord i had
no idea

  no you didnt but i did snap
drew the balcony sheath curtains
closer together they were metallic
dyed but it helped little with this
crude equipment we could not tell
if it were eavesdropping for au-
dibility or visibility or even if
someone with a magnetic non-re-
flecting invisible cloak were near
us

  no one very close snap said
softly he and i carried the de-
tector to the length of its wire out
into the arcade  the indicator
went nearer normal
wandi the invader



  its the other way i whis-
pered

  we went to the moonlit balcony
i searched its little length with my
hands no one-nothing here

  way down there on the pedes-
trian arcade i said

  to hell with it snap mur-
mured ill fix that

  inside the room we made con-
nection with a newscasters blaring
voice under cover of it we could
talk

  snap gathered us close around
him halsey has something impor-
tant-by the gods of the airways
he has and whats more-his
voice was a furtive whisper-its
about this damned interstellar in-
vader would you think that could
be connected in any way with hu-
mans here in the city so that they
would bother to eavesdrop us

  no i murmured i wouldnt

  well evidently its true hal-
seys office paged me on a public
mirror i happened to see it at
park-circle  when i answered
it halseys man wanted me to talk
in code i cant talk in code i
have enough to worry over with
the interplanetary helios then
they sent me to an official booth
where i got examined for positive
legal identification and then they
put me on the official split-wave
length after all of which precau-
tions i was told to be at halseys
office to-night at midnight and
told a few other things

  what demanded venza breath-
lessly

  only hints whats the use of
taking a chance by repeating them
now

  you said he wants me also i
pm in

  yes you and venza weve got
  get into his office secretly by
  vacuum cylinders were to

    	a man from his office at the
bighth postal switch-station
venza anita said sharply

  what in the universe can he want
with venza

  dont ask me because i dont
know

  well if he wants venza im
going

  snap gazed at her and grinned
that sounds like a logical de-
duction naturally he must want
you-thats why he said venza
im going anita insisted may
i gregg

it ended by her going venza
thought it a good idea and
snap and i had crossed these two
girls before and been defeated at
it we left about half an hour be-
fore midnight the girls were both
in gray with long dark capes we
took the public monorail down into
the mid-manhattan section under
the city roof of the business dis-
trict and into the eighth postal
switch-station where the sleek
bronze cylinders came tumbling out
of the vacuum portes to be re-
routed and dispatched again

  a man was on the lookout for
us

  daniel dean and party

  yes said snap we were or-
dered here

  the detective gazed at the girls
and at me it was three alto-
gether dean

  and now its four said snap
cheerfully the extra one is miss
anita prince ever heard of her

  he had indeed all right he
said if you and haljan say so
we were put into one of the
oversize mail cylinders routed
through the tubes like sacks of
recorded letters and in ten min-
utes with a thump that knocked
the breath from all of us we were
in the switch-rack of halseys outer
office

  we climbed from the cylinder
our guide led us down one of th
gloomy metal corridors it echoed
with our tread


astounding stories

  a door lifted

  daniel dean and party

  the guard stood aside come
in

  the door slid down behind us
we advanced into the small blue-
lit apartment steel-lined like a
vault and were in the presence of
detective-colonel halsey who
matched wits with the criminals of
three worlds and now seemed con-
cerned with another

chapter ii

the brain in the box

colonel halsey sat at his
desk with a few papers before
him and a bank of instrument con-
trols at his elbow he pushed his
audiphone and mirror-grid to one
side

  sit down please he gave us
each the benefit of welcoming
miles and his gaze finished upon
anita

  i came because you sent for
venza anita said quickly please
colonel halsey let me stay i
thought whatever you wanted her
for you might need me

  quite so miss prince perhaps
i shall it seemed that in his mind
were many of the thoughts throng-
ing my own for he added

  haljan i recall i sent for you
like this once before i hope this
may be a more auspicious occa-
sion

  so do i sir

  snap said weve been afraid
hardly to do more than whisper
but youre insulated here and
were mighty curious-

  halsey nodded i can talk free-
ly to you and yet-well even so
i cannot his gaze went to venza
it is you in whom at the moment
i am most interested

  me you flatter me colonel
halsey she sat gracefully reclin-
ing in the metal chair before his
desk seeming small as a child be-

tween its big broad arms but her
posture was anything but child-
like her long gray skirt had part-
ed to display her shapely gray-
satined legs she had thrown off
the hood of her cloak her thick
black hair was coiled in a knot
low at the back of her neok her
carmined lips bore an alluring
smile it was all instinctive to this
girl from venus it came as nat-
urally as she breathed

halseys gray eyes twinkled
do not look at me quite like
that miss venza or i shall forget
what i have to say you would get
the better of me im glad youre
not a criminal

so am i she declared what
can i do for you colonel halsey
his admiring amused smile faded
at once his glance included us all

  just this there is a man here
in great-new york-a martian
whom they call set molo he has a
younger sister setta meka have
any of you heard of them

  we had not halsey went on
slowly now apparently choosing his
words with the greatest care

  there are things that i can tell
you and things that i cannot
why not asked venza

  my dear for one thing if you
are going to help me you can do it
best by not knowing too much for
another i have my orders i am
only supreme in this department
you know and this thing concerns
the very highest authorities not
only of the usw but in ferrofc-
shahn and grebbar too

  he paused but none of us spoke
it seemed to me that here in the
dim muffled seclusion of this vault-
like room we were dabbling with
things gigantic sinister diabolical
perhaps things about which one
dared not talk openly and to me
there came a presage of infinite
evil the life or death of a few
people-what is that the capture
wandl the invader



of this criminal or that one the
recovery of stolen money a little
treasure which one might put into
a bank and find a few extra ciphers
on his deposit balance all that
seemed so trivial

but this which was now upon
us i could envisage was a
thing very different nations
worlds involved the life or death
perhaps of millions of people it
swept me with a breathless feeling
of awe and yet how far short of
the diabolical truth i really was

  halsey was saying quietly well
this martian and his sister are
here now in great-new york they
have some secret-they are en-
gaged in some activity-and i want
to find out what it is little parts
of it i have picked up-

  he stopped and out of the si-
lence snap said if you dont
mind colonel halsey it seems to
me you are mostly talking in code
im not but im trying to tell
you as little as possible you miss
venza-well you need only un-
derstand this the martian set
molo must be tricked into giving
you some idea of what he is doing
here in great-new york

  and i am to trick him venza
mid calmly

 that is my idea by what
aethod- the faint shadow of a
mile swept halseys thin intent
face my dear you are a girl of
venus more than that you are
traveled sophisticated and you
have far more than your normal
share of wits and brains

 it did not make venza smile
she sat tense now with her dark-
eyed gaze fastened on halseys
face anita equally breathless
reached over and gripped her hand

  then venza said slowly i re-
alize colonel halsey that this is
something vital

  as vital my child as it well
could be he drew a long breath

i want you to understand i am
doing my duty doing what seems
the best thing-not for you per-
haps but for the world

i seem ed to see into his mind
at that moment he might have
been a father sending a daughter
into danger

  he added abruptly i need not
disguise the danger i have lost a
dozen men he lighted a cigarette
i dont seem to be able to frighten
you

  no she said and i heard anita
murmur oh venza

  but you frighten me said snap
colonel halsey look here you
know im going to marry this girl
very soon	y

  if you live to marry her he
said quickly and he added but
i think were needlessly pessimis-
tic you can call it a sacrifice a
voluntary going into danger great
danger for a great cause in a great
crisis thats rather a usual thing
its been done many times you
four-you have just come out of
a very considerable danger we
know of what stuff you are made
-all of you

  he smiled again perhaps that
prominence is unfortunate for you
but let me settle it now is there
any one of you who will not
take my orders and trust my judg-
ment of what is best and do it
if need be blindly will you offer
yourselves to me

 we gazed at each other both
the girls instantly murmured
yes the feminine mind needs
no slow process of thought

  yes i said at last and it
came not too hard for me for i
thought i was yielding him venza
not anita

  snap was very pale he stared
from one to the other of us

 yes he said finally but
colonel halsey surely you can tell


astounding stories

halsey tossed his cigarette
away i will tell you as
much as i think best these mar-
tians this set molo and his sister
do not know of venza or at
least i think they do not they
apparently have not been here
very long how they got here we
dont know there was no passen-
ger or freight ship they have
in ferrok-shahn a dubious repu-
tation at best i wont go into that

  venza i will show you these
martians-and the rest depends
upon you there is a mystery you
will find out what it is get me
even a hint of it

  he reached for his inter-office au-
diphone i want to locate the
martian set molo francis staff
x has it in charge

  the audible connection came in
a moment

  francis

 we could hear the answering
microphonic voice

  yes colonel

  is the fellow in a public place
by any chance 

  in the red spark cafe colonel
with his sister and a party
good enough the red spark
has an image-finder have you
visual connection

yes the whole damn room they
got a dozen finders any time the
red spark passes up publicity-
use a magnifier get me the
closest viewpoint you can

  its done colonel i did it just
in case you called

  connect it

 in a moment our mirror-grid
was glowing with the two-foot
square image of the interior of
the red spark cafe i knew the
place by reputation a fashionable
more or less disreputable eating
drinking and dancing restaurant
where money and alcholite flowed
freely and the patrons were drawn
from all the most successful crim-
inals of the three worlds inter-

mingled with thrilled respectable
tourists who hoped they would see
something really evil-and gener-
ally were disappointed

  the red spark was not far from
halseys office it was perched high
in a break of the city roof almost
directly over park-circle 

  there he is said halsey

e crowded around this desk
the image showed the in-
terior of a large oval room bal-
conied and terraced a dais dance-
floor raised high in the center with
three professional couples gyrating
there and beneath them the pub-
lic dance-grid slowly rotating on
its central axis a hundred or so
couples were dancing the lower
floor was crowded with dining
tables others were upon the little
catwalk balconies and still others
in the terraced nooks and side
niches half enshrouded half re-
vealed by colored draperies

  the image now was silent for
halsay was not bothering with au-
dible connection but it was a riot
of color-flashing colored flood-
lights bathing the dancers in vivid
tints and there were twinkling
spots of colored tube-lights on all
the tables i saw too the blank
rectangles of darkness against the
walls which marked the private
dining rooms insulated against
sight and sound where one might
go for frivolous indiscretion-or
for dire plotting perhaps-and be
as secure from interruption as we
were here in halseys office

  venza asked eagerly which is
he

  over there on the third ter-
race to the left that table there
seem to be six of them in the

party

  we heard francis voice he was
in halseys lower manhattan of-
fice with this same image before
him

  well get a closer viewpoint
	-s- -y	-	  - 

wandl the invader -

me



the table in question was no
more than a square inch on our
image we could see an apparent-
ly gay party of men and women
one of the couples was gigantic
a martian man and woman ob-
viously the others seemed to be
earth or venus people

  francis voice added

  ive got a sound-wave magnifier
on them foleys been listening for
an hour nice clear english-much
good it does you this fellow is
as cautious as a director of the
lower air-lane    heres your
near-look

  our image shifted to another
viewpoint the lens-eye with which
we were connected now was mount-
ed over the draperies behind the
martians table we were looking
down diagonally upon the table
at a distance of no more than ten
or fifteen feet so that its image
filled all our grid

  there were three earth-women
in the party there was nothing
peculiar about them rather hand-
some dissolute in appearance all
of them obviously befuddled by
alcholite there was a man who
could have been anglo-saxon
about him too there appeared noth-
ing unusual-a wastrel probably
with more money than wit he
wore a black dinner suit edged
with white

  our attention focussed upon the
other two they were tall as are
all martians the young woman-
setta meka-seemed perhaps twen-
ty or twenty-five years of age by
earth clocking and in stature per-
haps very nearly my own height
which is six feet two it is difficult
to tell a martians age but she
was i saw a very handsome young
woman even by earth standards
in ferrok-shahn she would
considered a beauty her gray-
k hair was parted and tied at
back with a plaited metal rope
short dark cloak-so luminous

a fabric that it caught and reflect-
ed the sheen of all the gaudy res-
 taurant lights-was parted its ends
thrown iback over her shoulders
beneath it she wore the charac-
teristic martian leathern jacket
and short wide leather trousers or-
namented with spun metal fringes
and tassels most martian women
have a very war-like aspect more
masculine than feminine but i saw
now that setta meka was an ex-
ception

her brother who sat beside
her was a full seven feet or
more a hulking sort of fellow
far less spindly than most of his
race so that i judged he might
have come from the polar outposts
beyond the martian union he was
bare-headed his gray-black  hair
clipped close upon a round bullet
head with the familiar martian
round eyes

  i gazed from the viewpoint of
ten feet or so into the face of this
set molo as momentarily he turned
toward the concealed lens-eye it
was a rough-hewn strongly mas-
culine face of high-bridged hawk-
like nose bushy black brows
frowning above deep-set round
eyes the face of a keen-brained
villain i could not doubt though
the smooth-plucked gray skin was
flushed now with alcholite and
the wide thin-lipped mouth was
leering at the woman across the
table from him

  like his sister he too had thrown
 back his cloak disclosing a ibrawny
 powerful figure leather-clad with
 a wide belt of dangling ornaments
 some of which probably were
 weapons

  how long we gazed at this silent
colored image of the restaurant
table i do not know i was aware
of halseys quiet voice

  look him over miss venza it
depends upon you

  another interval passed it
  - - 	v

	astounding stories

seemed as we watched that molos
interest in his drunken party was
very slight i got the impression
too that though he seemed intoxi-
cated he was not nor was his
sister an anxiety seemed upon
her the smile she had for the
drunken jests seemed forced and
at intervals she would cast a swift
furtive glance across the gay res-
taurant scene

  more drink arrived the earth
people at the table here seemed
upon the verge of stupor and
suddenly it appeared that molo
had completely lost interest in
them with a gesture to his sister
he abruptly rose from his seat she
joined him they left the table
and a red-clad floor manager of
the restaurant came at their call
then in a moment they were mov-
ing across the room

  halsey called sharply into his
audiphone francis hold us to
them if you can

our image blurred then fo-
ley in the restaurant picked
them up from another viewpoint
they were standing now by the
opened door of one of the red
sparks private insulated rooms we
caught a glimpse of its interior-
a gaily set table with a bank of
colored lights over it

 the figure of a man was in
there he was on his feet as
though he had just arrived to meet
the martians here and a hooded
long cloak wholly enveloped him
it may have been a magnetic in-
visible cloak with the current
now off i think perhaps that it
was

  we caught only the fleetest of
impressions before the insulated
door closed and barred our vision
the glimpse was an accident molo
taken by surprise at this appear-
ance of his visitor could hardly
have guarded against it the wait-
ing figure was very tall-i thought

some ten feet-and very thin the
hood shrouded his face and head
in his hand he held a large cir-
cular box of black shiny leather
of the sort in which women carry
wide-brimmed festive hats as molo
joined him he put the box gently
upon the floor he handled it a
though it were extraordinarily
heavy and as he took a step or
two he seemed weighted down
just as the room door was hastily
closing-meka sliding it from the
inside-we caught a fleeting
glimpse of horror

  the lid of the hat box on the
floor had lifted up inside the box
was a great round thing of gray-
white-a living thing a distended
ball of membrane with a network
of veins and blood-vessels showing
beneath the transparent skin

 for that instant we gazed
stricken the ball was palpitating
breathing i saw convolutions of
inner tissue under the transparent
skin of membrane a little tentacle
like an arm with a flat-webbed
hand was holding up the lid o
the box the lid rose a trifle
higher the colored lights overhead
gleamed down and gave us a brief
but clear view of it

  the thing in the box was a huge
living brain i saw goggling pro-
truding eyes an orifice that could
have been a nose and a gash up-
ended for a vertical mouth it
was a face and the little ten-
tacle arm holding up the box-id
was joined to where the ear should
have been

 was this something human a
huge distended human brain with
the body withered to that tiny
arm 

  the palpitating thing sank down
in the box and the lid dropped
and upon our horrified gaze the
insulated door of the room slid
closed-a blank rectangle of dark-
ness with the silence and invisi-
bility of the barrage upon it

diabolical mystery

y the gods exclaimed hal-
 sey one of them dares
 come to the red spark here al-
 most in public

   so halsey knew what this meant
 but he would not tell us his eyes
 were blazing now his face was
 white and with an intensity of
 emotion which transfigured it

   francis did you see that no
 i dont want you to do anything
 let them alone in there tell foley
 ill be in the managers office in
 five minutes im coming

   he snapped off our image con-
 nection with the red spark went
 dead

   were going to the red spark
 i demanded

  yes you can come and i want
 you venza this changes every-
 thing-yet i dont know i may
 need you more than ever now
 no protested snap

  but halsey was herding us to
 the office door and he did not an-
 swer from his desk he had
 snatched up a few portable instru-
 ments and he flung on a cloak

   it was a brief trip to the red
 spark on foot through the sub-
 cellar arcade to where under park-
 circle  we went up in a ver-
 tical lift to the roof we were in
 the side entrance oval of the res-
 taurant in under five minutes

   i had tried to question halsey
 that thing in the box- but he
 silenced me in the dim metal room
 of orentino the red sparks man-
 ager where foley was waiting for
 us a barrage was up we could
 hear it faintly humming and see
 the little line of blue-yellow sparks
 snapping along the angles of the
 walls now we could talk

halsey slammed the door
down he said swiftly my
men caught one of those things

this morning they have it now
and i think molo does not yet
know we captured it a human
brain were convinced that it un-
derstands english and can talk-
but no one has been able to make it
talk yet foley order that damned
orentino to de-insulate the room
molo is in now by the gods we
may see and hear something
the frightened italian manager
of the red spark was in the res-
taurants control room halsey
killed our barrage to let the out-
side connections get through to
us we all crowded around the
mirror-grid which stood here on
orentinos desk foley gave us con-
nection with the control room we
saw orentinos fat swarthy face
with his eyes nearly popping from
fright

  but yet colonel halsey i will
do whatever you tell me

  what room is that martian oc-
cupying

  insulated 

  break off the insulation do it
slowly and he may not notice
then give us connection-audible
and visible

  but i have no image-finders in
the insulated rooms for why
should i have installed-

  cut off the barrage-ill get
connection there

  foley was already setting up his
eavesdropper on the desk the mir-
ror blurred a little then it clari-
fied we had the interior of the
secret room and voices were com-
ing out of foleys tiny receiver

the image showed the box on
the floor with its lid down
the tall hooded shape of the stran-
ger stood with molo and his sister
by the table they were talking in
swift vehement undertones the
language was martian a dialect
principally used in ferrok-shahn
our equipment brought it in
blurred and scratched but clear
  

enough to be distinguishable i
could understand it

molo was saying but you are
the fool to have dared come here

 the master is confused he
knows that there is danger some-
thing is wrong the hooded stran-
ger spoke like a foreigner not a
martian not an earthman-and
not like any person of venus i
had ever heard a strange weird-
ly indescribable intonation it was
a queerly flat hollow voice

  i am saying the master is con-
fused-

  well let him be

  and he demanded i bring him
here to find you he is displeased
that you are here

  what gruesome thing was this
their glances seemed to go to the
box on the floor at their feet as
though the master were in there
but the lid of the box did not
rise

  well you have found me molo
declared impatiently when you
know me better always you will
find i have my wits the thing is
for to-morrow night-not to-
night

  but that my master is not sure
the hollow voice was deferential
but insistent he fears danger
he swears that something has gone
wrong he is working on it now
striving to receive the message
there is a message he knows
that much perhaps from our world
wandl itself

for a moment molo had no
answer his sister had not
spoken i noticed suddenly that her
gaze seemed to be roving the room

  what is it i should do molo
asked at last

 come with us to your home-
room

  but i have everything ready
there the contact is ready for to-
morrow night your world will con-
trol earth to-morrow night-

stories	j

  but if it be to-night

 again molo was silent my
breath stopped on our mirror i
saw the strangers hood part just
a little there seemed to be no
face just the blur of something
brownish

  but if it be to-night insisted
the voice

  i will go molo agreed abrupt-
ly but that your coming here was
dangerous suppose we cannot get
out undetected you know i will
never go to where all our instru-
ments are set up and have some
damnable spy follow me is all go-
ing well on venus and mars

 yes my master feels so he
seems to get messages the con-
tacts will be made simultaneously

a gruesome chuckle the capture
of these three worlds-we shall
have all three enchained at once
helpless

  the lid of the black box seemed 
again about to rise when there
came a sharp cry from meka this
room is not insulated the hum is
gone-the sparks

 our eavesdropping was discov- i
ered beside me i heard halsey 
give a low curse on our mirror 
we saw sudden action the ten-
foot cloaked figure laboriously lift-
ed the black box and swung with
it toward the outer wall of the
room i saw now clearly with what
a dragging heavy tread that giant
shape moved-as though it weighed
here on earth far more than the
normal weight to which it was ac-
customed

  over there molo gasped the
escape-porte this room has one
meka go with him i will join
you-you know where

  foley cried colonel i may be
able to stop them

 but halsey saw on our image
that molo was staying wait let 
them go if we have the martian j
here well do better	i

 i saw the rooms escape-porte
wandl the invader	

       open as meka and the hood-
 ed shape carrying the box moved
 for it how many indiscreet wives
 upon frivolous occasions had done
 just that the moonlit darkness of
 the outer catwalk enveloped the
 disappearing figures

molo -was left alone he
closed the porte swiftly his
detector was now in his hand but
halsey anticipated him by a second
or two our listener went dead
our mirror darkened doubtless
molo was never sure whether he
had been spied upon or not

  halsey was on his feet foley
i get out into the main room stay
 with him

 but there was no need to fol-
low molo evidently ihe had stayed
to allay suspicion sent his visitor
and sister out by the escape-porte
which was usual enough and now
 he was back in the main room as
 though nothing important had hap-
 pened an appearance of intoxica-
j tion had again come to him he
wavered jovially across the room
threading his way through the gay
diners and reached the table where
his drunken party still sat carous-
ing

 	we saw all this from orentinos
 mirror-grid here in the managers
 office and then we saw that sur-
 reptitiously molo was using his
 aetector trying to verify if ray-
 ribrations were upon him we saw
 turn and gaze toward the lens-
 e in the curtains behind him
 again halsey shut us off he
 t make a move with any ray
 him thats evident

  you want him to leave i mur-

  of course i do i want him to
  unsuspecting if we had
  him-and that thing in the
  t would have told us noth-
  hes got a base somewhere in
  city-something damnable-

        you heard what they said

 about it weve got to trick him
 into going there unsuspecting

halsey seized the audiphone
his gaze went to venza
your chance its the only way
foley keep away from that mar-
tian shut off every ray every
lens in the place ill meet you out
there in a moment im sending a
girl shell go after him

  you-you want me to go now
murmured venza

  yes its the only way hell
think presently that no one is in-
terested in him perhaps you can
get him drinking oh venza if
you have any wiles to beguile men
use them now

  no gasped snap no i tell
you

  anita was clinging to venza
she cried abruptly colonel hal-
sey im going two of us

  halsey stared upon many dire
occasions he had been forced to
swift decision he made one now

  you may go that is still bet-
ter my girls-do your best all
your wits

  i jumped to my feet anita going
into this

  colonel halsey i should think
you could do something better
than-

  he gripped me by the shoulders
gregg haljan i take no sugges-
tions from you his blazing eyes
bored into me dont you realize
this means destruction of our three
inhabited planets ill sacrifice any-
thing-myself or you or these
girls venza take anita outside
ill join you in a moment-give
you last instructions you must
take with you a portable audi-
phone

  i wont let her go protested
snap this is diabolical

  halseys face softened a little
i can understand how you feel
but its necessary you cant force
this molo nor that thing in e


astounding stories

cloak nor the brain in the box
but if these girls can trick molo
find the course of this thing-
the girls were moving toward
tne door of the room i met snaps
anguished gaze

  gregg dont let them go
  no no i wont

  i made a lunge past halsey with
snap after me halsey did not
move from his place but one of his
rays struck us with all my senses
numbed i felt myself falling
gregg-dont-let them-

  snap had tumbled half upon me
my senses did not quite fade i
was aware of anitas and venzas
horrified cries but halsey forcibly
pushed them to the door it slid
up i vaguely saw the two girls
going out with halsey after them
and the door coming down leav-
ing snap and me lying stricken on
the floor

chapter iv

death of the brain

i have no clear idea how long
it was before halsey came back
ten minutes or half an hour snap
and i were seated on a low metal
bench against the wall the effect
of the accursed paralyzing ray was
wearing off we were tingling all
over clinging to each other on the
bench with our senses still con-
fused and within me-and i know
that snap felt the same-was a
feeling of terror that the girls had
gone upon such a mission queerly
mingled with a sense of shame at
our actions in trying to stop them
a sacrifice a danger for the good
of many others whose lives are as
important to them as ours to us
of course we would risk such a
sacrifice and that halsey had had
to force us was humiliating yet
the human mind individualizes
the terror menacing the worlds
was a vague generality our love
for those two girls was very real

  halsey stahcedin upon us so
you are recovered

 snap stammered we-i say
were sorry as hell we acted like j
that

 i know you are his voice
softened if i could have done
anything else believe me i would
but i hope-i dont think harm
will come to them they are
clever

  are they outside i asked did
they find a way of meeting the
martian how long have you been
gone

halsey merely stared at me
as though he had no inten-
tion of answering and then the
audi phone on the desk buzzed

  this is halsey he said yes

i have them here bring them-
did you say bring them

 we could not hear the answer-i
ing voice for halsey had the muf-
fler in contact

  no i would prefer not to come
im watching something im at th
red spark cafe well im going
back to my office presently to wait
there

  he turned suddenly into talking
code like snap i had never hac
occasion to learn it the word
were a strangely sounding staccato 
gibberish he ended i will sent
them grantline very well i wil 
tell them to locate him at once



yes

  halsey closed off the audiplionj
and swung on us	

 youre all right now	

  yes i said i stood up draw
ing snap up with me i was dej
termined now at least that w
would have the stomach to act like
men and not like frightened moon
struck lovers i added what a
wanted of us colonel halsey r
thats better gregg h
smiled the flashing anger
gone from him now but he
still grim i wanted you here
 wandl the invader	

   t for this call from the con-
clave of public safety it met at
midnight they have ordered you
there-you two

  where asked snap thats a
secret meeting isnt it there was
no report of it over the air to-
night

  yes secret i dont know the lo-
cation myself they wanted me
also he smiled his faint smile
again but i begged off as you
heard

  he was leading us to the door
they wont need you for more
than half an hour when they fin-
ish -come back to my office you
can come openly he stood with
his finger on the door lever good-
by lads from the service room
here-foley will lead you to it-
you are to take a mail cylinder for
postal switch-station  theyll re-
route you from there to the con-
clave auditorium-whichever one
has been selected

the door slid up when you
disembark he added ask for
johnny grantline you are to sit
with him

  good-by sir i said

  he showed us out and the door
slid down upon him we trudged
the corridor and snap gripped me

  for myself he whispered swift-
ly ill go to the damnable con-
clave because im ordered but i
wont stay there long half an
hour didnt he say once we get
out of it if i dont route myself
back here to the red spark im a
motor-oiler

  i agreed with him it did not
seem so utterly terrifying now we
had a mental picture of anita and
venza in the red sparks public
room doubtless orentino had cre-
ated a way for them to meet molo
they would sit here in the red
spark with that drunken party
and in less than an hour we would
be back

  but as we passed diagonally
across an end of the main room
with foley leading us we caught
a glimpse of molos table the
drunken party was still there but
molo anita and venza were gone

  we had no time to get any in-
formation foley abruptly left us
and another man took his place
in the service room a passenger
cylinder was waiting our guide
entered it with us at the switch-
station we had our breath knocked
out with the bumping but the
cylinder remained sealed and after
another ten minutes in the vacuum
tube we reached our unknown des-
tination

  the cylinder-slide opened we
found ourselves with a lone guard
and through a gloomy arcade open-
ing johnny grantline was advanc-
ing to greet us

  well so here you are gregg
hell to pay heaven going on here
come on in ill tell you

  we were sent for snap said
yes they told me to contact
with you but they dont want you
yet come on in

he waved away the guard and
led us through a padded ar-
cade into a low vaulted audience
room windowless and gloomy
across it a doorway panel stood
ajar grantline peered through it
there was the glow of light from
the adjoining room and the distant
blended murmur of many voices

  grantline closed the door they
dont want you yet theyll buzz
us sit down and ill tell you-
where are we i asked that
damned cylinder routed us un-
known

  the ninth conclave hall

  i knew its location lower man-
hattan high under the city roof

  grantline produced little cigarette
cylinders

  steady your nerves lads youll
need it
astounding stories

  he grinned at us the hand witih
which he lighted my cylinder was
steady as a tower-base but he was
excited nevertheless i could see
it by the glint in his eyes and hear
it in his voice

  whats going on snap de-
manded

  its about this invading planet
by the gods when you hear whats
really been learned about it-

  well what i asked

he sketched what ihe had heard
this night at the conclave
the mysterious invader was in-
habited

  how do they know that snap
put in

  dont be a nit-wit wait till you
hear the rest of it the accursed
thing changes its orbit it banks
and turns like a space-ship it
stopped out in space its poised
out there now between mars and
jupiter a world a fifth or sixth
as big as our moon and it swims
of its own volition its inhabited
and the beings on it can control its
movements theyve brought it in
from interstellar space into our
solar system evidently the point
theyve reached now is as far as
they want to come theyve poised
out there getting ready to attack
not only us but mars and venus
simultaneously

  grantline gazed at us through
the smoke of his cigarette he was
much like snap this johnny grant-
line small wiry brisk of move-
ment and manner but he was much
older than snap his hair was grey-
ing at the temples his voice always
carried the authority of one accus-
tomed to commanding men

  dont ask me for the technicali-
ties of how they reached these
conclusions im no super-astrono-
mer im only telling you what the
discussion has been here for the
past hour

  heaven knows we had no incli-

nation to dispute them what we
had seen and heard at the red
spark during this hour tallied very
well with his words

  he went on swiftly the attack
of whatever nature it may be they
seem to feel is impending at once
not next month or next week but
now lord gregg i dont blame
you for staring like that you
dont know whats been going on
for the past two days-on earth
and venus and mars of course
you dont its all been suppressed
neither did i until i heard it here
to-night the usw-the martian
union-the venus free state-all
of us are preparing for war cali
it governmental panic if you like
you didnt know did you that
every government space-fly er on
the earth is being commissioned
were not going to sit around and
wait for invaders to land the war
-if there is to be one-wont be
fought on earth if we can help it

e stared snap said

  what makes them think-

  that a war is coming grant-
line finished for him plenty this
new planet has sent out space-
ships the planet itself is hovering
sixty million miles away from us
about forty million miles from
mars and close to ninety million
from venus perhaps its leaders
think thats the most strategic spot
at any rate there it is and its
poised there

  then it sent out space-ships
three of them one-right now to-
night-is hovering close to venus
another is near mars and the third
is some  miles off earth
several of our interplanetary
freighters are overdue it seems
now that they must have encoun-
tered these invading ships and been
destroyed

  an enemy ship hovering now
within  miles of earth
closer even than our nearby moon
     -< * > -  -

wandl the invader

  grantline was continuing vehe-
mently

  still more and worse these
three hovering ships have already
landed the enemy on mars and
venus the ihelio-reports mention
mysterious encounters in ferrok-
shahn and grebbar for three or
four days mars has been in a panic
of apprehension venus almost as
bad and here on earth the enemy
has landed here not many per-
haps but one has been captured
a thing-god its almost beyond
description

  we could well agree with that
since snap and i had just seen one

  theyve got it here grantline
was saying theyve tried to make
it talk they cant but theyre
going to try again force it this
time it seems to understand our
language the light in its eyes
when they speak to it-

  a shudder was in his voice he
jumped to his feet and went to
the door of the room probed it
open a trifle and came back to us

  theyre bringing it in upon
his face was a look of awed horror
the look which everyone bears when
fronted with the gruesome mystery
of the unknown come on lets
watch

 we stood crowding the small
door-oval it gave onto a darkened
little balcony of the conclave hall
the girders of the city roof were
over us there were a few official
spectators sitting up here in the
dark on the balcony but none
noticed us

the lower floor of the hall was
lighted around the polished
oblong tables perhaps a hundred
scientists and high governmental
officials of the three worlds were
seated near the center of the hail
was a small dais-platform on a
table there someone had just placed
circular black box similar to the
we had seen previously

 

  the hall was hushed and tense
on the dais stood a group of earth
officials one of them spoke

  here it is gentlemen and this
time by god if we can make it-
speak-r-

  the war secretary from great-
london grantline whispered

  i recognized him-brayley com-
mander in chief of the land air
water and space armies of the
united states of the world he
was gigantic in stature with a great
shock of gray-white hair a com-
manding figure if there ever was
one

  beside him the little japanese
representative in great-new york-
one nippor-seemed a pigmy the
acoustics of the silent hall carried
his soft voice up to us

  will we use force torture now
-it is vital necessary

  yes by god anything

  it seemed that everyone in the
hall must have been shuddering i
could feel it like an aura pound-
ing up at me brayley lifted the
box-did and with his naked hands
reached in and raised the horrible
thing held it up a two-foot ball
of palpitating gray-white mem-
brane another living brain a
human thing

  now damn you youre going
to talk to us understand that
were going to make you talk get
that box out of the way

  they flung the box to the floor
and brayley placed the brain on
the table the glare of light from
an overhead dome came down full
upon it beneath the stretched taut
membrane the convolutions of the
brain showed like tangled purple
worms the blood-vessels seemed
distended almost to bursting now
for the thing was terrified the
gruesome face with popping eyes
and that gaping mouth showed a
horrible travesty of terror from
where its ears should have been a
crooked little arm of flabby gray-


astounding stories

white flesh oame down one on each
side and braced the table and i
saw now that it had a shriveled
body or at least little legs bent
almost crushed under it by its
weight

  now damn you-brayley stood
rubbing off his hands against his
coat-for the last time will you
talk

the goggling eyes held with
terrified but baleful gaze upon
brayleys face did it understand
the eyes were fronted our way
and suddenly their glance swung
up so that i seemed for an instant
to see dovn into them and it
swept me then this was a thing of
greater intelligence-greater knowl-
edge perhaps-than our own a
human with brain so developed
that through myriad generations
the body was shriveled almost
gone and only this distended brain
was left a mind was housed here
an intelligence-housed in this
monstrous brain which itself was
unhampered by any bony container
of skull

  were these the beings of the new
planet which had come to attack
us but how could this helpless
thing-incapable of almost every-
thing obviously save thought-do
the work of its world how could
this enemy space-ship hovering
now only  miles away be
built and launched and guided with
only things like this to command
it

  then i recalled again that in-
sulated room of the red spark
cafe the thin ten-foot hooded
shape which was carrying the black
box was that perhaps an opposite
type of being a human with the
brain submerged dwarfed and the
body paramount it had called one
of these brains master were
there on this mysterious planet
two co-existing types of humans
each a specialist one for the

physical work and skill and the
other for the mental

  it was an instant rush of thoughts
as i stood with snap and grant-
line in that dark balcony doorway
gazing down to where the giant
brain stood braced upon its shriv-
eled arms and legs terrified and
yet glaring defiance of these men
of earth mars and venus who
were here under its gaze and i
realized then why we of earth and
venus and mars are all cast in the
same mould we call human it is a
little family of planets here in our
solar system for countless eons
we have been close neighbors the
same sunlight the same general
conditions of life the same seed
were strewn here by a wise crea-
tor a man from the orient is
different from an anglo-saxon a
man of mars differs a little more
but basically they are the same

yet here confronting us now
was a new type from realms
of interstellar space far beyond our
solar system this new human had
come what knowledge what new
methods of thought conceptions of
human relations it might hold who
could guess but that it came as
an enemy intent upon destroying
us unless we destroyed it-that
much seemed obvious

  for the dast time will you talk
cried brayley

 there was another interval of
silence the eyes of the brain were
very watchful its gaze roved the
hall as though it were seeking for
help it shifted its little arms on
the table seemingly exhausted al-
ready from the physical effort of
supporting itself

 brayleys voice came again
doubtless you can feel pain
well see

  with what effort of will to over-
come his revulsion we may only
guess he reached forward and
pinched the little arm the result
wandl the invader

was electrifying from the up-ended
iit of mouth in that goggling face
came a scream it pierced the heavy
tense silence of the hall a scream
ghastly in its timbre weird un-
earthly like nothing that any of us
had ever heard before and in it
was conveyed an agony of physical
suffering as though brayley had
inflicted not a little pinch of that
flabby arm but had thrust a red-
hot knife into its vitals

  the brain could feel pain indeed
it crouched with stiffened arms
and legs the membrane of its great
head seemed to bulge with greater
distension the knotted blood-
vessels were gorged with purple
blood the eyes rolled then it
closed its mouth its gaze steadied
upon brayleys face so baleful a
gaze that as i caught the reflection
of its luminous purple glow a shud-
der of fear and revulsion swept me

  so you did not like that bray-
ley steadied his voice if you
dont want more you had better

	peak how did you get here on
earth what are you trying to do
here

there seemed an interminable
interval of silence then nip-
por the little japanese took a
menacing step forward

  speak we will force it from
you he spread his lean brown
fingers before the brains face
shall i stab into you

 and then it spoke do-not-
touch-me-again

  indescribable voice human ani-
mal or monster no one could say
but the words were clear precise
and for all their terror they seemed
to hold an infinite command

  a wave of excitement swept the
hall but brayleys gesture silenced
it he leaped forward and bent
low over the palpitating brain

  so you can talk you come as
an enemy we have given you
every -chance to-day for friendship

and you have refused you come
allied with martian criminals you
have a ship quite near us out in
space what are you trying to do
to us

  it only glared

  speak

  i will not tell you anything
  oh yes you will

  no

 all the men on the platform
were crowding close to it now

  speak ordered brayley again
here in great-new york the mar-
tian molo has a hiding place
where is it

  no answer

here is it you are per-
haps a leader of your
world i lead ours-and im going
to master you now where is this
hiding place

 the thing suddenly laughed a
gruesome eerie cackle you will
know when it is too late i think
it is too late already

  too late for what

 to save your world doomed
your three worlds dont-touch-
me

 it ended with a scream of ap-
prehension the exasperated hot-
tempered japanese had reached for
it his fingers closed on the crooked
little arm he rasped

  tell us what to do to save our-
selves

 no let-me-go

  tell us you damnable-

  no it screamed again let-
me-go

 tell us by the lord if you
dont-

  nippor strengthened his squeez-
ing grip the thing was writhing
the thin ball of membrane palpi-
tating heaving and suddenly it
burst over all its purpled surface
blood came with a gush

 nippor and brayley staggered
backward the scream of the brain
ended in a choking gurgle the
 

astounding stories

little legs and tiny body wilted
under it the round ball of mem-
brane sank to the table it rolled
sidewise upon one arm and ear and
in a moment its palpitations ceased
a purple-red mass of blood it lay
deflated and flabby

  it was dead

chapter v

the star-streak

ut see here i said did
they mention the martian
molo at all brayley told that ac-
cursed thing out there-

  they were discussing molo be-
fore you arrived grantline told
us

 we had drawn back from the
doorway the conference with the
dead thing on the table removed
was proceeding snap and i had mo-
mentarily forgotten anita and
venza but now we were in a
panic to get back to the red spark

  but you cant go said grant-
line brayley ordered you here
hell want to see you -in a mo-
ment

  well why dont he see us now
snap protested im not going to
cool myself off sitting here

  oh yes you are

  grantline sent word to brayley
that we were here in a moment
the answer came we were to wait
a short time and then he would
want to see us

  we swiftly told grantline what
had happened ait the red spark and
found that already he knew most
of it francis had relayed it to the
conference and halsey now was in
constant communication with the
officials here

 then what is happening i
demanded where are the girls
has halsey heard from them

  again grantline went to a nearby
room

  anita sent a message he said
when he returned they are with

molo an indefinite message but
halsey is ordering a squad of men
to be ready

  grantline swiftly sketched for
us what had happened in the red
spark anita and venza flaunting a
simulated drunkenness with a skill
for acting which i knew both of
them possessed had joined that
drunken party perhaps if meka
had been there she would have seen
through them

but molo did not and they
have since told me that the
martian was himself far from sober
although he was probably not aware
that the drink was affecting him
whatever his emotions-and in the
light of what subsequently occurred
i can guess at how he felt toward
venza-he yielded to their demands
to leave the restaurant with him
he wanted as we know most des-
perately to leave unobtrusively and
venza threatened a drunken scene
unless she could go

  he took them leaving openly
in a public far e-car doubtless he
at first intended to de-rail them
somewhere and proceed secretly to
his lair but they convinced him
that he was not followed twice he
used his detector and anita and
halsey were clever enough to throw
off their rays in time to avoid it

  then halsey lost connection with
the fleeing car and after that molo
doubtless changed his mind his as-
sociation with these two supposedly
drunken and wholly attractive
young women amounted to an
abduction

  these we can only guess were
his motives for acting as he did
and we know that his sister
showed immediate disapproval of
tois rashness

 but where are they now i
demanded of grantline good god
we cant let them-

  you said grantline sternly
are out of it do you think that
wandl the invader	

thing may hang and you and snap

j halsey-under brayleys orders
 i now-will neglect any chance to
  find out where molo is hiding he
 and these brains-you saw one of
 them die just now rather than tell
 the secret-theyre planning some-
 thing you heard from the in-
 sulated room of the red spark that
 shrouded figure say that liis master
 thought it would be to-night
 something is about to happen this
 conference is wrestling with it in
 grebbar and ferrok-shahn theyre
  striving to find out what it is
 something impending now the
 martians and venus people like us
 realize that the helios are pouring
 in here from venus and mars
 theyre mobilizing their space-
 flyers just as we are

 grantline at last was letting
 out all his apprehension upon
 us with this burst something
 nameless hideous youve only been
 touching the surface like the gen-
 eral public which must be pro-
 tected from panic halsey didnt
 tell you that the entire resources
 of his organization are out upon
 this thing to-night here at the con-
 clave theres a room of information-
 sorters thats just where i came
 from a moment ago every country
 on our earth is making ready-for
 what nobody knows halsey and
 all his force are on the alert-for
 what its ghastly not knowing
 what youre fighting halsey let
 that martian woman and the hooded
 stranger get away he thought he
 could pick them up again but he
 hasnt

   hes had two fragmentary calls
  from anita he has a hundred men
 ready to rush to their aid and to
 capture molos lair he expects an-
 other message from anita any mo-
 ment this conference here knows
 every movement that is being made
 witmn ten or twenty seconds of
 its making perhaps upon anita and
 venza the whole outcome of this

rail because you love them and
they are in danger

  we had no answer to that we
could only stare at him

  but see here i stammered
who is this molo halsey didnt
tell us

  he told us nothing said snap
nothing that he could avoid
youd think we were damn
children

  youve been acting like it molo
is an interplanetary pirate the
star-streak-

  good lord

e had heard of him indeed
for five years past a mys-
terious gray space-flyer with a base
supposedly hidden in the polar
deserts of mars had been terror-
izing interplanetary shipping many
of the smaller freighters between
the worlds had mysteriously van-
ished captured and destroyed by
the star-stretdk as the pirate chip
was called

  they think grantline went oo
that molo was cruising with his
pirate ship he has as you know
a band of criminals drawn from all
the three worlds supposedly about
fifty of them commanded by him-
self and his sister we think that
molo and his pirate flyer-last
month probably-encountered the
three flyers which this new planet
sent out the star-streak was cap-
tured perhaps destroyed and molo
and his band themselves outlaws
enemies to our three worlds joined
with this new enemy to save them-
selves-and because they have been
promised greater rewards

  but why would these brains want
them want their help snap de-
manded

  this is all theory probabilities
only wouldnt you say it was be-
cause in ferrok-shahn grebbar
and here in great-new york simul-
taneously to-night something has
astounding stories

  be accomplished something the
themselves could not do
and bis band know all three
how they landed here in
-new york nobody knows
e enemy space-ship is 
miles out obviously they came
from it-landed secretly with some
smaller vehicle somewhere on
earth and made their way here
and when whatever it is theyre
expecting to do is accomplished
theyll try to escape by the same
method but by the gods if we
have our way-

  a buzzer hissed beside us a mi-
croscopic voice commanded

  grantline bring gregg haljan
and daniel dean to room six at
once mr brayley wants them
now

  in room six we stood before the
war secretary who had arrived
there a moment ahead of us

  ah haljan-and dean im glad
to see you

he was still white and shaken
beads of perspiration stood
upon his forehead he mopped them
off

  ive just had a-rather terrible
experience he did not suggest
that we ait down he went on
crisply

  grantline has no doubt told you
some of the things which are upon
us to-night

  i have said grantline

  quite so disturbing terrifying
things    haljan in a word there
is an enemy ship out in space god
knows of what character we dont
it is at this moment seemingly
poised visually not over twelve de-
grees from the moon the observa-
tory at tokyohama reports that
they can see it plainly with the
solarscope we have a ship haljan
being rushed into commission to-
night you know her-the com-
etara

  i know her i said

  quite so she is taking flight
as soon after dawn as we can make
her ready she will carry about
fifty men the armament and men
are in charge of grantline you
dean we want to handle her radio-
helio

  thank you said snap

  and you haljan-we can think
of no one better fitted to navigate
her

  he waved away my words of ap-
preciation within another day we
shall have thirty such ships in
space mars and venus also are
mobilizing god know we hope it
will prove unnecessary this first
ship may perhaps meet the enemy
conquer it

but there was no conviction in
his voice he stood up we
feel haljan that if anyone can
handle the cometara with skill
enough to combat this lurking
enemy it will be you

  i will do my best sir

 we know that the ship is
leaving from the tappan inter-
planetary stage as soon after dawn
as possible when have you ant
dean last slept

  snap and i gazed at each other
last night we both said

  quite so then you need sleep
now i want you to go at once t
the tappan interplanetary field
house the commander there wil
give you a room supper and mak
you comfortable eat and sleep i-
you can we want you to keej
out of this nights activities here ir 
the city you understand

  yes sir i agreed

  we want you refreshed for wha
may come upon the cometara that
more than anything is vital ai
orderly was approaching behin
brayley im coming back in 
moment rollins brayley smile
wanly so much at once-it leave

not see you again until its over
good luck lads grantline they
need you for a moment in the hall
something about electronic space-
gun equipment for the cometara
then youd better go to tappan
house also and get some sleep
we were dismissed snap and i
regarded each other hesitantly i
said impulsively

  mr brayley detective-colonel
halsey is using two girls to-
night-

  yes were watching that hal-
jan

 they are the girls we are to
marry i added may we com-
municate with colonel halsey
yes call him from here he
smiled his tired smile but keep
out of it you lads remember we
need you at dawn

  yes sir thank you

  he took grantline with him and
left us alone in the little room

  well burst out snap thats
that if i go up to tappan before
venza and anita are safe im a
motor-oiler

  same here but snap weve got
to be there by dawn or soon after

the tappan departure-stage was
only a few miles up the hud-
son across the tappan-zee from
the westchester residential dis-
trict we could get there in half
an hour

  it was now nearly trinight or
halfway between midnight and
dawn there was no audiphone
connection in this small room we
did not want to leave it and talk
from an audiophone in some other
room

 not me saiid snap when i
o out of here i go with a rush
f we poke our heads out there
now somebodyll grab us route us
up to tappan with a guard set up
your speaker gregg you can get
him

  i had my portable audiphone to

use sound connection only for lo-
cal distances about the city it vas
dependable in a minute or two
halsey accepted my call

  you gregg

  yes were at the conclave
theyre through with us where is
anita oh colonel halsey
please-

  weve heard from her twice
some time ago gregg just frag-
ments its all i can tell you tm
expecting-

  we could hear someone inter-
rupting him then he came back
gregg i was saying molo took
them somewhere he had his detec-
tor commissioned i didnt dare fling
after them-anita warned me not to
try it she had to stop connection
herself god knows how she has
been able to whisper to me at all

is voice like brayleys had
the ring of a man almost con-
fused mentally strained to the
breaking point i could appreciate
how halsey must feel in his youth
a man of physical action forced now
almost always to remain at his cen-
tral desk with his encircling banks
of instruments holding all the net-
work of his far-flung activities cen-
tralized his voice his decisions and
commands in a hundred places
almost simultaneously-while his
body sat there inactive at his desk

  gregg its all i can tell you i
have men strewn about the city
when the clue comes ill send them
in force the girls must have ar-
rived at molos place by now
watching their chance to communi-
cate if only they know where they
are so that they can tell me   
gregg i must disconnect-
colonel halsey-anitas fre-
quency - the wave-combination -
give me that maybe snap and i
can pick up the message when it
comes and not disturb you any
more

  he named the oscillating fre


astounding stories

quency of the instrument anita was
using then he disconnected

  but can you pick up that fre-
quency snap demanded anx-
iously

  yes i think so

  then come on well try it as
we go

  go where

  it faced us down we were long-
ing for action there was no place
to go nothing we could think of
to do

  the hell sit here then said
snap try that frequency weve
got to do something if shell
only send us a hint

  the rooms door-slide suddenly
opened and an orderly appeared be-
fore us

  haljan

  get the hell away roared snap
weve had our orders we dont
want any from you

  gregg haljan and daniel dean
are paged on the mirrors the or-
derly said mildly

  someone in the city wanted us
our names were appearing on the
various mirror-grids publicly dis-
played throughout the city in the
hope that we would answer

  thats different said snap an-
swer it for us thats a good fellow
say were too damn busy

  it must be important the or-
derly insisted the caller reg-
istered a fee at the search bureau
thats how they located you here
he paid the highest fee to search
you an impending danger emer-
gency call-

  that is different i exclaimed
it was against the law to invoke
the services of the search bureau
unless based upon actual impending
danger such a call at once enlisted
the services of halseys organiza-
tion

  well take it i told the or-
derly

  come with me sir he turned
and left swiftly

e hastened with him to a
corridor cubby upon the 
audiphone there i was at once con-
nected with a voice and an anx-
ious mans face with a two-day
growth upon it

  haljan thank god you answer
this is dud ardley me and shac
are here listen this is the lower
cellar corridor lateral  under
broadway street for gods sake j
dont get it mixed me and shac
just have seen your girls down
here	j

 news of anita and venza i
could see in the mirror-image be-
hind duds head the outlines of the
little public cubby from which he
was calling he and his brother had
been traversing this deserted lowest
cellar corridor of east side lower
manhattan upon some illicit er-
rand of their own they had seen
figures alighting from a fare-car
by instinct the brothers ardley
were always furtive they had
crouched and watched and had
caught a glimpse of the faces of
venza and anita the girls were
hooded and cloaked a hooded man
was with them the fare-car quickly
rolled away and the hooded fig-
ures suddenly becoming invisible
within their magnetic cloaks had
vanished

  selp me we couldnt do nothin
we aint armed gregg-you know
we take no chances with the police
by carryin cylinders so i paged
you in a hurry

  dud thats damn nice of you
where are you now tell me again
the ardleys knowing nothing of
the events of this night supposed
that the girls were being abducted
or were perhaps upon some esca-
pade about which snap and i should
be informed

  damn right dud well come
at once you two wait for us

sure if you got instruments i
maybe we can track em it wasnt i
a quarter of a mile from here- i
wandl the invader



over toward the river plenty of
rotten dumps down there

  the cellar tenements of the city
where all the scum of its popula-
tion gathered i knew that many
criminal martians and venus people
lived in that disreputable shambles

 wait for us dud well come
in a rush

 i slammed up the audiphone
snap beside me had heard it all
he shoved the astonished orderly
out of our way

 whats the nearest exit-route
out of here hurry up you

 to the city roof sir up this
incline and-

 we dashed up the spiral incline
through a low exit-porte and were
in the starlight of the city roof

chapter vi
the screaming light-beam

u

 connect it gregg you
cant tell-her message might
come over any minute

 i	tuned the receiving coils of
the little portable audiphone to the
seldom used oscillation frequency
which halsey had told us anitas
transmitter was sending

 anything gregg

 no dead channel

 the air in anitas channel was
so baffiingly silent

 snap was rushing us in a small
official tram-car along one of the
south-bound roof-tracks we had
been almost immediately challenged
by a roof-guard when we appeared
from the upper porte of the con-
clave hall the city roof was not
open to public traffic but our well-
known names and a glib half-true
story of the recent interview with
brayley calmed the guards ire he
let us pass he even found us a
single-seat hand-tram and started
us southward on the deserted shin-
ing rails

 it was a cloudless night with
stars like thickly strewn diamonds

on purple velvet the city roof lay
glistening in the starlight in my
great-grandfathers time there had
been almost no roof here an opei
city exposed to all the inclement
weather but gradually the arcades
and overhead viaducts cross bal-
conies and catwalks which spanned
the canyon street between the
giant buildings became a roof it
spread now terraced and sloped to
top the lofty buildings like a great
rumpled sheet propped by the knees
of sleeping giants some of the
roof was of opaque alumite-dark
patches alternating with the great
glassite panes which in places ad-
mitted the daylight

our little single-moitor tram
sped southward upon the nar-
row paralleled rails which wound
their way over the terraces save
for the guards and lookouts in their
occasional cubbies and the air-traf-
fic directors in their towers we
were alone up here the roof was
tangled with air-pipes line-wire
conduits ether-wave aerials - arte-
rial systems of the ventilating and
lighting devices as far as one
could see the ventilators stood
fronting the night breeze like little
listening ears there were water
tanks great cross-bulkheads and
flumes to handle the rain and snow
a few traffic towers maintained or-
der in the overhead air-lanes their
beacons stood up like swords into
the sky when the passing lights
marked the thinly-strewn trinight
traffic

  we were stopped at intervals but
in each case were passed promptly

  nothing yet gregg

  no

  anitas channel remained so hor-
ribly silent it was i suppose no
more than ten minutes during
which we sped south along the gro-
tesque maze of the roof but to us
it was an eternity of horrible imag-
inings the girls were down in the
astounding stories

shambles of the east side city
cellar if only some message would
come   

  ill pull up here

  yes i said

  i gathered up my lifctle audi-
phone thrust it under my dark flow-
ing cloak if only our cloaks were
magnetic but they were not

  we leaped from our car aban-
doned it on a siding

  in a ruslh haljan said the
guard

 thats us orders from mr
brayley

  we left him and plunged into a
descending automatic lift a drop
of a thousand feet we shot down-
ward past all the deserted levels
past the ground-level the under-
surface tramways the sub-river
tubes the sub-cellar-down to the
very bottom of the city

 come on gregg two segments
from here

e advanced almost at a run
at this hour of the night
hardly a pedestrian was in evidence
it was an arched vaulted corridor
almost a tunnel dimly blue-lit with
short lengths of fluorescent tubes at
intervals on the ceiling for all the
vaunted mechanisms of our time
the air here was heavy and fetid
moisture dripped from the concrete
roof it lay on the metal pavement
of the ground the smell of it was
dank tomb-like

  there were frequent cross-tun-
nels we turned eastward into one
of them for a segment there were
the lower entrances to the cellars
of the giant buildings overhead
we passed a place where the tun-
nel-corridor widened into a great
underground plaza the sewerage
and wire-pipes lay like tangled py-
thons on its floor half across it by
the glow of temporary lights strung
on a cable a group of repairmen
were working we passed them
headed in to where the tunnel nar-

rowed again and there were now
occasional cubby entrances to un-
derground dwellings

  it was a rabbit warren from here
to the river a disreputable sham-
bles haunted by criminals and by
miserable families many of whom
never saw the daylight for weeks at
a time the very air was sodden
the giant voice of the city hardly
carried down here so that an op-
pressive silence hung upon every-
thing-as though death were si-
lently stalking here with only our
hastening footfalls on the mettal
grid of the pavement echoing
through the stillness the few pe-
destrians whom we passed were
furtive as ourselves

  that next crossing gregg-they
said theyd wait for us but i dont
see them

  occasional escalators led up-
ward the overhead traffic-most of
it at this hour concerned with the
citys incoming food and milk sup
ply-sounded as a vague rumble
in advance of us was a narrow in-
tersection a giant pipe one of the
main arteries of the vacuum-tube
postal-transit system hung above
the corridor intersection there
were a few lights in the bullseyes
of the subterranean dwelling rooms
but most of them were dark

  easy snap not so fast

a premonition of evil of
something wrong here sud-
denly swept me i pulled snap to
a walk we edged over against the
tunnel side we had passed a small
lighted audiphone cubby-evidently
the one from which shac and dud
had paged us they should have
been here waiting but there was
nothing save the empty gloomy
tunnels 

 something is coming snap
clutched at me we drew our cloaks
around us and waited in a shad-
owed recess down a side incline
a segment behind us a small auto-
wandl the invader



matiic food truck came lurching
it pulled up at an arcade entrance
-doubtless some food-shop serving
the dwellings of this area its driver
slid the portals deposited his
cases of food locked the panel
after him and in a moment he and
his truck were gone back up the
incline

  we heard in the ensuing silence
a low groan someone moaning near
at hand it sent a chill over me it
seemed quite close to us then
abruptly it stopped we saw with-
in twenty feet of us two dark fig-
ures lying on the pavement grid
in a black patch of shadow where
the mail-tube came down in a
curve and disappeared into the
tunnel wall

 we bent over the figures of two
men they lay together one half
upon the oither-black-garbed fig-
ures wtith white staring faces one
twitched a little and then lay still
they were shac and dud ardley
murdered gregg good lord

both were dead but we could
see no marks upon either of
them something had killed them
as they waited here for us

 i found my wits snap we cant
stand like this-wholly visible

 it seemed suddenly that there
must be invisible enemies lurking
here things strange beings watch-
ing us preparing to strike with
hidden death as they had struck
at shac and dud

 i pulled snap away we darted
a few feet the light of the tunnel
intersection was directly over us
not here snap run

 a panic was on us like animals
terrified at the light we plunged
away seeking darkness

 under the curving vacuum tube
a little further along we found
shelter snap murmured

 the girls were past here but
which way gregg which way
as though i knew

  i felt at that moment under my
shirt against the skin of my chest
the annode of my audiphone re-
ceiver tingling a receiving signal
anitas channel was not dead in
the gloom i could see snaps white
face as he watched me hastily bring-
ing it out

  a call gregg

  yes i think so

  hurry oh hurry

 we heard a tiny microphonic
voice-anitas voice

  colonel halsey yes i have the
location lafayette -east corridor
lowest level there was a descend-
ing entrance i dont know the num-
ber dont you speak again ive
only a minute venza safe-but
send help something we dont un-
derstand-a strange mechanism
here molo is-

  then halseys interrupting voice
anita escape you and venza
we cant theyve got us

 im sending men-theyll be
there in ten minutes if you-
ten minutes oh that will be
too late molo is-

 it seemed that we heard her
scream the waves blurred and died
but in my horrified ears her mi-
crophonic scream was ringing

the channel was dead had
molo discovered her lafayette
a-east corridor lowest level a
descending entrance   

  snap thats here as near here
as we could place it a descending
entrance i

  we stood backed against tlhe
great curving side of the postal
vacuum tube within it i heard the
hiss and clank as a mail cylinder
flashed past grinding around the
curve halseys orders must be
going out now his men nearest
this place would come in a rush
ten minutes and they would be
here but anita said that would
be too late

 snap and i were frantically

astounding stories

searching somewhere here was a
hidden descending entrance leading
to molos lair it seemed in the si-
lence that anitas scream over that
audiphone was still ringing in my
head had it been entirely from the
instrument or were we so close
that in actuality we had heard its
distant echoes

 gregg help me

  snap was tugging at what seemed
a horizontal door-slide like a trap
in the tunnel floor partly under the
vacuum-tube

  the damn thing-stuck

  no it yielded with our efforts
it slid aside steps led downward
into blackness we plunged in
caution was gone from us the
teps went down twenty or thirty
feet we were in another smaller
corridor it was vaguely lighted by
a glow from somewhere then as
my pupils expanded further i could
see this was a shabby alley street
opening ahead into a winding pas-
sage with the slide-porte above us
like its back gate a shambling
warren of cubbies was here a little
sequestered segment of disreputable
dwellings

  we stood peering listening
shall i try the eavesdropper
gregg take only a minute to con-
nect

  yes no wait

  i thought i heard distant sounds
  voices snap listen

  more than voices a thud foot-
steps running a commotion back
in this metal shambles within a
hundred feet of us

  this way i murmured

we plunged into a black gash
there was a glow of light-
a glassite pane in a house wall
nearby the commotion was louder
and under it now we heard a vague
humming something electrical it
was an indescribably weird sound
like nothing i had ever heard be-
fore

- snap clutched at me in here-
but where is the accursed door
there was a glassite pane but
we could find at first no door in
our hands we held small electronic
bolt-cylinders-short-range weapons
-but they were all we had

  the hum and hissing was louder
it seemed to throb within us as
though its tiny ultra-rapid vibra-
tion were communicating to every
fiber of our bodies

  no door then we rushed to the
glassite pane snap drew back his
fist as though he would smash his
weapon into the glassite

  you cant break it too thick
light was streaming through it
now we glimpsed the interior of
a room the place a few moments
before must have been dark the
light now came from a strange
mechanism set in the center of the
metal cubby i caught only an in-
stants glimpse of it-a round thing
of coils and wires the metal floor
of the room was cut away exposing
the gray rock of manhattan island
and against the rock in a ten-foot
circle a series of discs were con-
tacted with wires leading from
them to the central coils

  the whole was humming hissing
and glowing with a weird opales-
cent light it was dazzling blinding
within it the goggled figure of
molo was moving adjusting the
contacts he stooped he straight-
ened drew back from the light

  only an instants glimpse but we
saw the girls crouching with black
bandages on their eyes meka gog-
gled like her brother was holding
them a tall shape carrying a round
black box darted through the light
and ran molo leaped for the girls
perhaps he shouted the hum had
mounted to a wild electrical scream
molo flung his sister and the girls
back out of the light

 they all vanished there was
nothing but the light and the
mounting dynamic scream
wandl the invader



beside me snap was pounding
on the glassite panel i joined
him we raged baffled but it was
all only a moment i was suddenly
aware that my senses were reeling
i was pounding mechanically in a
vague mechanical hopeless frenzy
everything was dream-like blurring
as though unconsciousness were
upon me

  where was snap gone then i
saw him nearby he had found a
door but it wouldnt yield per-
haps he thought he saw another
door his shout was lost in that
screaming din but i saw his arm
go up in a gesture to me he ran

  i found myself running after him
but i stumbled and fell then over
me the scream burst into a great
roar of sound it seemed so intense
so gigantic a sound that it must
ring around the world

  and the light burst with an ex-
ploding puff the black metal cubby
walls seemed to melt like phantoms
in a dream a titans blow torch
the opalescent light shot upward
a circular ten-foot beam eating its
way through all the city levels as
though they were paper up through
the city roof

 molos cubby was gone his
mechanism was eaten by the light
and destroyed there was only this
motionless upstanding beam con-
tacted here with the earth stream-
ing like an opalescent sword into
the starry sky

chapter vii
three swords crossing in the sky

i must paint now upon a broader
canvas to depict the utter chaos
of this most memorable night in the
history of the earth venus and
mars

  from that point in the bowels of
great-new york near the southern
tip of manhattan island the mys-
terious light-beam shot up it
screamed with its weird electrical

voice for an hour so penetrating a
sound that it was heard with the
unaided ears as far away as phila-
delphia a screaming titan voice
it was shrill as if with triumph
there were millions of people awak-
ened by it this night awakened
and struck witih a chill of fear at
this nameless siren shrilling its
note of danger the sound grad-
ually subsided it seemed to reach
its peak within a few minutes of
the appearance of the light and
within an hour it had ceased

  but the light-beam remained
those who inspected it closely have
given a clear description of its
aspect but to this day its real na-
ture has never been determined

  it was a circular beam of about
a ten-foot diameter in color it was
vaguely opalescent rather more
brilliant at night than in the day-
time though with the coming of
the sun strangely it did not fade
but remained clearly visible with a
spectrum sheen when the sunlight
hit it so that it had somewhat the
appearance of a titanic straightened
rainbow

  from that contact point with our
earth the inexplicable beam stood
vertically upward it ate a vertical
hole like a chimney up through all
the city levels through the roof
and above that it streamed unim-
peded into the sky it had a tre-
mendous heat communicable by con-
tact so that it melted the city above
it with a clean round hole but
the heat was non-radiant

  i was found lying within fifty
feet of the base of the beam there
had been an explosion so that
molos metal room was gone but
i had fallen beyond its destructive
area and from where i lay there
was only a warmth to be felt from
the light

  halseys men found me within
half an hour i was unconscious but
not injured i think now that the
sound and not the light overcame


astounding stories

me i presently recovered conscious-
ness for another hour i was blind
and deaf but that quickly wore off
they rushed me through the chaos
of the city to the tappan inter-
planetary headquarters grantline
was there but not snap i sent
them back when once i was fully
conscious they searched all the
vicinity at the base of the light
snap alive or dead was not to be
found

anita and venza were gone
not dead-i could not think
that for i had seen molo and
meka plunge away with them as the
light-beam burst forth they were
gone and snap was gone my emo-
tion at the loss and my own in-
ability now to do anything about it
was distracted by the rush of
events

  there was by now a turmoil un-
precedented throughout all the met-
ropolitan area the motionless light-
beam itself had done little damage
there was the ten-foot burned hole
of its upward passage but of ma-
terial damage nothing more

  but its appearance brought in-
stant chaos within a radius of five
miles of its base the city was
plunged into darkness all power
was cut off lights were out every
vehicle tram tube-train-the aeros
passing overhead-the city ven-
tilating systems-all ceased audi-
phones were wrecked every coil
and fuse-wire the ignition systems
of all the myriad devices were ren-
dered inoperative why no scientist
even now can clearly say it was
not they claim any unknown ray-
aura from the light they think now
it was the vibrations from the
sound whatever its physical na-
ture that sound was like nothing
ever heard before on earth it sub-
sided within an hour and after
that lights and motors brought into
the darkened area were not affected

  but during that hour within the

stricken area there must fcave been
scenes most horrible grantline and
i up the hudson in the distant
suburban section sat and listened
to the incoming reports of what
was transpiring south manhattan
was in a black panic of death a
multitude of terrified people awak-
ened in the night to find blackness
and that screaming sound the black
streets and corridors and traffic
levels were jammed with panic-
stricken throngs trying to escape
trampling and killing each other in
their terror

this was in the stricken area
but everywhere elsel the panic
was spreading transportation sys-
tems were almost all out of commis-
sion the panic spread until by
dawn there was a wild exodus of
refugees jamming the bridges and
viaducts streaming from all the
city exits into the suburban districts

  this was great-new york but
it was only one of three cities
grantline and i that dawn in tap-
pan got only a confused summary
of the interplanetary helios from
venus and mars came reports of
similar chaos in grebbar and in
ferrok-shahn-doubtless almost si-
multaneously with great-new york
-similar light-beams appeared

 but what can it be i de-
manded of grantline something
molo contacted there he did it-
that was what he was working for
-and he accomplished his purpose
but what will the beam do to us

  its doing plenty said grant-
line grimly

  but he didnt intend that some-
thing else-

  but what as yet no one knew
i had already told the authorities
what i had seen of molos mech-
anism snap venza and anita were
vanished i was the only eye-wit-
ness to molos activities and heav-
en knows i had had but a brief con-
fused glimpse
wandl the invader

 obviously molo had come tc
earth with these weird beings from
the new planet had come to great-
new york to establish a contact
with the earth and create this light-
beam the mechanism he had
planted down there on the naked
rock of manhattan island brought
the beam into being-and de-
stroyed the mechanism

the beam remained it streamed
upward from the rock they
thought this night that the rock
atoms might be disintegrating that
molos strange current had set up
a disintegration of the atoms and
tihat electronic particles from them
were streaming into space

  the light-beam seemed impervious
to attack within a few hours the
authorities were attacking its base
with various vibrations but without
apparent success

  from where grantline and i sat
in an upper balcony doorway of
the tappan headquarters we could
see the giant beam standing over
the city far to the south it was now
just before dawn a clear starry
moonless night the eastern stars
were paling to the south above
the metal ramparts of the giant city
the now silent beam mounted into
space very strangely even at this
distance it was as clear as though
we were close to it i tried to fol-
low it with my gaze into the sky
how far did it extend it seemed
up there like a narrow radiance of
glowing star-dust the straightened
tail of a comet a million miles or
a hundred million no one could
do more than guess

 the dawn was coming but the
beam-radiance remained unaffected

  gregg look there at venus

  to the east of us there was a dis-
tant line of metal structures sur-
mounting the mid-westchester hills
to us they formed the horizon-
line and above them in the bright-
ening sky of dawn venus was just

rising mars had already set at our
longitude venus fairly close to the
earth now was the morning star
visually at a narrow angle from the
sun and rising just before dawn
telescopically it was a giant nar-
row crescent but with the naked
eye it was a brilliant blue-white
star it mounted now above that line
of metal stages in the distance

  and as grantline gestured i saw
from venus the same sword-like
beam streaming off almost to cross
our own

  grantline and i with a mutual
thought ran around the balcony
and gazed toward where mars had
set a narrow radiance was stream-
ing up among the stars off there

three swinging swords of
light in the sky with the ro-
tation of the planets they swept
the firmament the mysterious
enemy had planted them-but why
what was to happen next within
grantline and me-and countless
millions on earth mars and venus
felt the same-there came an in-
finite dread a horror unnamable

  what was coming next

  and as though to answer us from
far to the south over mid-jersey
came a new manifestation we saw
a speck rising a distant mounting
speck of something dark with
streamers of tiny radiance flowing
from it

  a space-vehicle gregg

  it seemed so it came slowly frbm
above the maze of distant struc-
tures gathered speed and in a mo-
ment was in the upper air-then
through it like a rocket and gone
to our sight

  but others better equipped had
observed it it was a cylindrical
projectile with stream-fluorescence
propelling it upward it was some
unusual form of space-vehicle tele-
scopically it was seen until well
after dawn speeding out in the
direction of the moon


astounding stories

  molo and his weird allies es-
caping grantline and i had that
thought and afterward it was
proven the truth with their work
done here on earth they were es-
caping into space to rejoin the
hovering enemy ship  miles
out

  i stood gripping grantline on
that little balcony and gazed with
sinking heart were anita and
venza prisoners on that mounting
enemy vehicle would i ever see
them again and snap-had molo
perhaps dashed out from his metal
cubby just as tihe light was burst-
ing and come upon snap was
snap on this rising projectile-cyl-
inder with all my heart i could
only hope that he might be there
uninjured with the girls so that he
might lend them the protection i
had failed to give

  haljan and grantline wanted be-
low

  the voice of a mechanic on the
balcony behind us roused us from
our thoughts we went down
through the busy building grant-
line steadying me for i was still
shaken from my experience

the workshops of the tappan
interplanetary headquarters had
for hours been ringing with busy
activity which grantline and i had
ignored the cometara rested upon
her departure stage outside with
a score of workmen conditioning
her grantline and i were to com- 
mand her but the efficiency of the
organization kept us out of all
activity until the start so that we
might rest

   rest indeed

  we were plunged now into the
actual departure the cometaras
newly installed armament was
aboard ready to be assembled after
the start the men to handle it
were embarked my half-dozen of-
ficers and the ten members of the
crew i had already briefly met

they were aboard now waiting for
me

  on we go gregg lets wish our-
selves luck

  from grim silent abstraction
johnny grantline had now sprung
into his familiar dynamic self-so
lrke snap

  there was a solemn group of of-
ficials and a hundred or so work-
men here gathered to speed us off
and wish us luck no gaily ap-
plauded departure this rising of
the cometara the faces around me
were white and haggard

  they stopped their fevered labors
now for a moment to see the
cometara get away first of earths
ships speeding into space to con-
front this nameless enemy no one
was in the mood for applause
grantline and i went past them si-
lently with silent handshakes and
murmured good-byes i saw the
towering figure of brayley he
raised an arm for a farewell ges-
ture to us and turned away as
though overcome by emotion

e mounted the incline to
the cometara she rested
upon her stage a great sleek bronze
ship low and rakish with pointed
ends and a flattened arched turtle-
back dome of glassite covering the
superstructure and the decks from
bow to stern she lay quiescent
gleaming in the glow of the de-
parture beacons but there was an
aspect of latent power upon her
an eagerness to get away as though
impatiently she waited here for me
to come and speed her into action

 my ship my first command
upon such a mission i was destined
now to take my first command as
we went through the opened porte
of the dome-side and i touched foot
upon the deck i prayed that i might
justify the faith reposed in me

  men crowded the narrow covered
deck i saw the electronic space-
guns at the deck pressure-portes
wandl the invader



partly assembled my chief officer-
a young fellow named drac david-
son who with his twin brother had
been in the interplanetary freight
service-rushed up to me

  we are ready sir

  very good drac

  he hurried me to the turret con-
trol room grantline instantly had
plunged into details of assembling
the weapons

  her portes are all closed said
drac he spoke calmly but his
thin face was pale and his dark eyes
glowed with excitement the in-
terior pressure is set at  pounds
you can ring us up at once

  no formalities to this departure
with pounding heart i entered
the small circular turret and
mounted its tiny spiral stairs to the
upper control room but as i
touched the levers all the excite-
ment droppedaway

 a calmness came to me-an ab-
sorption with these familiar tasks
at which i was skilled

  i slid a central-hull gravity-plate
it went smoothly perfectly op-
erated by the magnets the vessel
trembled lifted outside the en-
closing dome i could see the dawn-
light of the sky and the paling
floodlights of the stage figures of
men out there with silent gestures
of farewell dropping slowly be-
neath our hull as we lifted

the bow gravity-plates slid into
the repulsive-force positions
the bow lifted the cometara re-
sponded very smoothly to my will
we went up poised at a forty-five
degree angle i saw the outer bea-
cons on the stage swing upward
with their warning to passing traf-
fic in the lower lanes

  light our bow-beacon drac
we lifted through the lower
thousand and two thousand-foot
lanes the lights of tappan were
dwindling beneath us the interior
of the cometara was humming with

the whirr of its circulators and air-
receivers mingled with the throb
of the interior-air pressure pumps
at three thousand feet i started the
air-rocket engines they came on
with a gentle purring the fluor-
escence from them streamed along
our hull and down past the stern
like twin rocket tails

 with gathering speed we slid
smoothly upward through all the
highest traffic lanes out of the at-
mosphere through the stratosphere
and into space

  leaving the stratosphere i cut
off the air-rocket engines slid the
stern gravity-plates for the earths
repulsion and the bow plates for
the attraction of the moon and son
the firmament swung in a slow arc
and steadied with the earth be-
hind us and the sun and moon in

our course plunging through space
with accelerating velocity toward
the unknown enemy ship hoverktg
two hundred thousand miles ahead
of us my orders were to find the
ship and maneuver us close to it
and grantlines orders were to
assail it if only we could have seen
ahead a few hours to what awaited

 i gazed down at the convex
north atlantic with the reddening
coastline of north america spread
like a map great-new york was
down there in the chaos of panic
the safety of three world per-

of our encounter

  but what was the nature of this
strange enemy that opalescent
beam from great-new york was
now so horribly apparent mount-
ing with its radiance into the dome-
like starfield and the one from
venus and the other from mars
seemed crossing overhead amid the
stars

  three swords crossing in the sky

by h g winter

sleepily the lookout stared
at the scope-screen before
him wishing for something
that would break the monot-
ony of the scene it pictured the
schools of ghostly fish fleeting by
the occasional shafts of pale sunlight
filtering down through breaks in the
ice-floes above the long snaky ropes
of underwater growth none of this
was conducive to wakefulness nor
did the half-
speed drone of
the electric en-
gines aft and the
snores of some
distant sleeper

killer whales and seal-creatures
tangle ken torrance in an amaz-
ing adventure under the ice-roofed
arctic sea

help him the four other men on
duty in the submarine-the helms-
man the second mate whose watch
it was the quartermaster and the
second engineer-might not have
been present so motionless and si-
lent were they

  the lookout man stifled-another
yawn and glanced at a clock to see
how much more time remained of his
trick then suddenly something on
the screen
brought him to
alert attention
he blinked at it
stared hard-and
thrilled


thirty feet of berserk killer came curving towards the lotte man

  far ahead caught for an instant
by the submarine narwhals iight-
beams a number of sleek bodies
moved through the foggy murk
with a flash of white bellies and an
easy graceful thrust of flukes

 the watchers hands cupped his
mouth he turned and sang out
k-i-i-ll-ers i see killers

  the cry rang in every corner and
immediately there was a feverish re-
sponse rubbing their eyes men ap-



peared as if from nowhere and
jumped to posts with a clang the
telegraph under the second mates
hand went over to full speed cap-
tain streight rolled heavily out of
his bunk flipped his feet mechani-
cally into sea-boots and came stamp-
ing forward first torpooner ken-
neth torrance as he sat up and
stretched heard the usual crisp
question

 where away


astounding stories

  five points off stabd bow sir
quarter-mile away swimming slow
how large a school

  coulcbyt say sir looks around
a dozen

  whew whistled ken torrance
thats a strike he pulled on a
sweater and strode forward to the
scope-screen to see for himself even
as captain streight all at once testy
with eagerness bawled

  stabd five torpoon ready mis-
ter torrance mister torr- oh here
you are take a look

never in the two years of ex-
perience which had brought
him to the important post of first
torpooner had ken failed to thrill at
the sight which now met his eyes
directly ahead now that the nar-
whals bow was turned in pursuit
but veering slowly to port swam a
pack of the twenty to thirty-foot
dolphins which are called killer
whales their bodies so close-
pressed that they seemed to be an
undulating wave of black occasion-
ally sliced with white as the fluke-
thrusts brought their bellies into
iew their speed through the shad-
owed gloomy water was equal to
the submarines when alarmed it
would almost double

  three more of em will fill our
tanks grunted streight his chunky
face almost glowing he bit on a
plug of tobacco his eyes never mov-
ing from the screen now if only
we hadnt lost beddoes    y
think you can bag three mister tor-
rance

  well if threell fill our tanks-
sure grinned ken

  the others eyebrows twitched
suddenly theyre speeding up he
shouted and then that torpoon
ready there good his voice low-
ered again as ken pulled his belt a
notch tighter and snatched a last
glimpse of the fish before leaving i
want you to try for three son he
said soberly but-be careful dont

take fool chances and keep alert
remember beddoes

  ken nodded and walked to the tor-
poon catapult hearing streights fa-
miliar send-off echoed by the men of
the crew who were nearby

  good hunting

the idea of an underwater craft
for the pursuit of killer whales
-tremendously valuable since the
discovery of valuable medicinal
qualities in their oil-had been
scoffed at by the majority of the
alaska whaling companys officials
at the time of its suggestion but the
narwhal after her first two months
of service had decisively proved her
worth she was not restricted to the
open seas now swept almost clean
of the highly prized killers she
could follow them to their last
refuge right beneath the floe-edges
of the arctic circle and as a result
she could bring back more oil than
any four surface whalers

  with a cruising radius of twenty-
five hundred miles she stayed out
from the base until her torpoons had
accounted for anywhere from sixty
to eighty killers one by one these
sea-animals would be taken to the
surface and there cut up and boiled
down until her tanks were full of
the precious blubber oil ever far-
ther she pressed in her quest for the
fish schools dipping for leagues into
a silent sea that for ages had been
known only to the whale and the
seal and their kindred a sea always
dark and mysterious beneath its
sheath of ice

  the inner catapult door closed be-
hind kenneth torrance and he slid
into his torpoon twelve feet long
and resembling in miniature a dirigi-
ble was this weapon that made prac-
tical an underwater whaling craft
the tapered stern bore long direc-
tional rudders which curved round
the squat high-speed propeller its
smooth flanks of burnished steel
were marked only by the lines of the
seed of the arctic ice



entrance port which the torpooner
now drew tight and locked twin
eyes of light-beam projectors were
set in the bow which was cut also
by a vision-plate of fused quartz and
the nitro-shell guns tube successor
to the gun-cast harpoon

  ken lay full-length in the padded
body compartment his feet resting
on the controlling bars of the direc-
tional planes hands on the torpoons
engine levers a harness was buckled
all around him to keep him in place
his gray eyes level and sober
peered through the vision-plate at
the outer catapult door

 suddenly a spot of red light
glowed in it the door quivered
swung out a black tide swirled
into the chamber there came the
hiss of released air-pressure and the
slim undersea steed rocketed out
into the exterior gloom her light-
beams flashing on and propeller set-
tling into a blur of speed as she was
flung

ken turned on her full twenty-
four knots zoomed above the
dark bulk of the slower mother ship
whose light-beams flashed across him
for a second and then straightened
out in a long slight-angled dive
after the great black bodies ahead

  aware that some strange enemy
was on their track the killers had be-
come panicky and were darting away
at their full speed which was only
slightly under that of the torpoons
humming motors and which at times
even surpassed it ken saw that it
looked like a long chase and settled
his lean body as comfortably as he
could

  his mind was not concentrated on
the task ahead for the first part was
mere routine and he could follow his
quarry almost mechanically and so
as his steel shell drove through the
ever-shadowed icy sea he began to
think about the disappearance of
chan beddoes the narwhals second
torpooner

  dead now beddoes it was a week
since he had set out on the chase
from which he had never returned
ken could only conjecture as to
what had stricken him down there
were countless possibilities perhaps
a blow from a dying killer whales
flukes bursting his torpoons seams
perhaps a crash into underwater ice
whatever it was it had been sud-
den for not even a faint radioed
sos had trembled into the ear-
phones of the narwhals radio-man
for two days they had held hopes
that the second torpooner still lived
as the sea-suit stored in each torp
contained air-units sufficient for
thirty-six hours but a whole weeks
passing told them that that vast
stretch of glacial sea was now chan
beddoes grave

  kens reflections brought an urge
to get the present job over with as
quickly as possible he squeezed an-
other ounce of speed from the tor-
poon taxing it to the limit and set-
ting up a slight vibration then he
fondled the nitro-shell guns trigger
and studied the huge fish bodies
ahead

  seems as if theyre going to run
forever he muttered indignantly
well be to the pole if they keep it
up

already the narwhal was
miles behind through the
torps vision-plate a scene of ever in-
creasing mystery and gloom met his
gaze the killers course had brought
them beneath a wide sheet of ice ap-
parently for there were no more
columns of pale sunlight piercing
through the quarter-light mono-
tone was unbroken save by deeper
drifts of shadow and as he drummed
through it the torpooner wondered
at its lifelessness he discerned no
more of the ghostly fish-schos that
usually abounded some enemy pos-
sibly had driven them from the re-
gion  but not the whale he was pur-
suing for they scorned such fare


astounding stories

  he was scanning the surrounding
murk apprehensively when of a
sudden his brain and body tensed

  off to one side far to the right he
thought he had glimpsed a figure it
was hanging motionless level with
him and at first it looked like a seal
but the flippers seemed longer than
a seals moreover no seal would be
anywhere near a pack of killer
whales nor did they poise in an up-
right position it couldnt be a seal
he told himself what then was
it only imagination that made it ap-
pear faintly human-shaped

  he strove to catch it again with
staring eyes but it was gone leav-
ing only a jumbled impression of
something fantastic in his mind and
the next instant the whole thing was
forgotten in the movements of the
killer school now only a few hun-
dred yards ahead

 they suddenly began a great
sweeping curve to the right a typi-
cal maneuver before standing for at-
tack or breaking up at once ken
swerved to starboard and drove the
torpoons nose for an advance point
on the circle the fish were describ-
ing his move swallowed the dis-
tance between them the sleek
thick-blubbered bodies swept close
by his vision-plate their rush tossing
the torp slightly twelve of them
went past in a blur and then came
the thirteenth the invariable strag-
gler of a school the thin light-
beams pencilled through the dark-
ness outlining the rushing black
shape ken gripped the guns trig-
ger and jockeyed the torp up a trifle
in the seconds remaining always
keeping the sights dead set on the
vital spot twelve inches behind the
whales little eye

hen only fifteen feet sepa-
rated them he squeezed the
trigger and at once zoomed up and
away to get clear of the killers start
of pain and if the shot were true its
following death flurry

  the shell slid deep into the rich
outer blubber and wheeling ken
watched the mighty mammal quiver
in its forward rush this was merely
the reaction from the pain of the
shells entrance the nitro had not as
yet exploded

  now it did the projectiles car-
ried but a small charge in order not
to rip too much the buoyant lungs
and so cause the body to sink but
the killer trembled like a jelly from
the shock the heart was reached
its razor-sharp flukes thrashing and
tooth-lined jaws clicking the killer
wheeled with incredible speed in its
death flurry a minute later the body
shuddered a last time then drifted
slowly over showing the white bel-
ly it began a gentle rise up toward
the ceiling of ice

  one grinned ken torrance he
noted his position on the torpoons
dials and gave it to the narwhal by
radio they would then follow and
pick up the whale

  ill have the second in ten min-
utes he promised confidently
signing off

  again the torp darted after its
prey

  he found it easy this time to
overhaul them not many minutes
had elapsed before he again caught
sight of their rhythmically thrusting
flukes and the flash of white under-
sides unaware that one of their fel-
lows had been left a lifeless carcass
by the steel fish again nearing them
they had reduced their speed some-
what

  ken angled down a hundred feet
into the deeper shadows not want-
ing to apprise them of his presence
he continued at that level until the
belly of the rearmost whale polled
white above him then he veered off
to the left rising as he did so in
order to bring his assault to bear di-
rectly on the killers flanks

  he swung back and streaked in for
the kill it looked like an easy one

  but he was never more mistaken
seed of the arctic ice



in his life for as luck had it he
had chosen a tartar a fighting fish-
literally the killer which its kind
had been named

the torpooner knew what he
was in for as soon as he fired his
first shell its aim was bad and in-
stead of sinking into the flesh it
merely ripped across the whales
back leaving a ragged ugly scar

 an ordinary whale would have
been scared into panic by the wound
and doubled its speed in an effort to
get away but ken torrance saw this
one wheel its six-foot snout around
viciously until its beady little eyes
settled on the torpoon

  ill be damned he muttered
hes turning to fight all right
come ahead

  he veered about and fired another
shot that missed its mark by feet
but creased the whales flukes at
once this terrible weapon lashed ti-
tanically up and down and thirty
feet of berserk killer came curving
towards the lone man inside his shell
of steel ken tensed himself for com-
bat he would have to keep a good
distance from the fish and fire until
he got it as a square smash from its
flukes might crumple the torp like
an egg-shell

  but his foe gave him no chance
crazy with pain and anger it swept
p and nipped his dive for the bot-
tom with a fluke-blow that tumbled
tbe torpoon over and dazed its pilot
before he could get straightened out
at was on him again catching him up
into a wild whirlpool butting the
shell and flashing round to get its
flukes into position with a wrench
ken jammed the rudder over shoved
his accelerator flat and got free just
as the tail thrashed down he was
thing hard and sweating as he
ked around-to see once more
whale its wicked jaws wide
n charging directly at him

 for a moment he was unable to
 ve such a mode of attack was

totally unexpected and the sight
held him fascinated he could see
the very wrinkles of the monsters
skin as it rushed in with shadowy
flukes thrusting behind could see
the lines of dagger-like teeth the
cavernous maw and gullet and then
all vision was blotted out as the jaws
closed around the torpoons nose

  ken did not wait for those jaws
to crunch shut he gripped the ni-
tro-shell guns trigger and squeezed
it back

  the weapon hissed flung its shell
he reversed his engines to try and
tear free seconds dragged by with
no result then he felt a mighty jolt
his harness broke and he was
pitched into the torps engine con-
trols

  that was all he knew save for a
vague feeling of falling falling over
and over which was ended when a
second bone-shaking shock brought
complete oblivion   

it was darkness that met his eyes
when they opened the eery dark-
ness of the floor of the polar sea

  darkness half-conscious as he
was he started in surprise he
looked for the torps shaded control
board-lights but could not find
them bewildered he wondered what
had happened and then remembered
the whale in its flurry it had
smashed him down

  pain was thumping his forehead
where he had struck the control
levers with a groan he twisted his
body around and felt for his hand-
flash at any rate there was no water
inside the body compartment the
seams had resisted the blow but
why were there no lights

  he found his hand-flash and its
beam showed him the reason play-
ing it on the small water-tight door
which separated the main compart-
ment from that in which the ma-
chinery was contained he looked
through its fused quartz peep-hole
he gaped in consternation


astounding stories

  there was after all a leak in the
torpoons shell and a bad one the
machinery compartment was full of
water

  gosh he muttered that means
no light no radio-no power guess
im stranded

  he considered the situation it
was not serious for he had been in
touch with the narwhal after bag-
ging the first whale and had given
his position the submarine would
proceed to the kill immediately
then after a while not hearing from
him they would scour the neighbor-
hood just as they had hunted for
chan beddoes when he did not re-
turn

  but theyd find him ken told him-
self-and soon he had no idea how
long he had lain unconscious but
probably by now the mother ship
had already hooked onto the first
whale maybe she was already hunt-
ing for him

  well id better get out and be
ready to signal to em with the
flash he reflected they may miss
me here in the mud

taking his sea-suit from a long
narrow locker he drew the stiff-
woven fabric over his body turned
the air-units on clamped the face-
shield shut and then gripping his
hand-flash slowly opened the port
in the shells side

  a weird figure he was fit for the
mysterious gloom into which he
came with casque of steel and lead-
weighted feet staring face-shield
and metal belt and equipped with a
knife and two or three emergency
tools the sea-suit transformed him
into a clumsy grotesque giant he
sloshed into the muddy sea bottom
stumbling at first from the heavy
water resistance and hardly able to
see anything the torpoon itself was
a hazy blur at a short distance but
up above the light was better being
almost bright next to the ice ceiling
he adjusted the air pressure inside

his suit floating his feet off the bot-
tom a few clumsy armstrokes and
he went drifting gently upward

 knowing that the bends-
bubbles of air in a divers veins-
come from too rapidly changing
pressures when rising he made his
ascent carefully up twenty feet
then a pause twenty feet more and
another pause so he rose some
ninety feet and finally arrived at
the underside of the ice floe

  here he found the water a pale
blue-green increasing at the limit
of his vision to impenetrable black
nearby was a great dark blur which
he recognized as tg killer whale that
had struck him down it bobbed life-
lessly against the smooth light ceil-
ing of ice slowly he swam over
towards it

  there was no mark of the havoc
his last shot must have wreaked in-
side he examined the body with
interest fingering the two inch-long
teeth which even the mighty sperm
whale fears and flees from

  pretty wicked he said aloud
just for the companionship of his
voice and theres a lot of oil in
this brute streightll be glad to get
him maybe he wont need a third
to fill the tanks

  thought of his captain made him
look up and around hoping to see
the narwhals light-beams come
threading through the distant murk
he did not see them but what he
did see caused his mouth to drop
open and his veins to chill with a
cold that was not that of the sea nor
the ice above

  good lord he whispered that
thing-again

  like a specter from the deep some
hundred feet away was a form seal-
like in appearance yet not wholly
seal it poised there motionless ap-
parently looking straight at him

fear came over ken as he
studied it its body was perhaps
ten feet long and sleek and fat under
seed of the arctic ice



a brown-colored hide but its flippers
were not those of a seal they were
too long and slender especially the
hind ones they unquestionably
bore a remote resemblance to human
arms and legs

  yet it cant be anything but some
kind of seal ken whispered to him-
self it must be

  but then too it did not have the
ordinary seals bullet head set squat
between smoothly tapering shoul-
ders but rather something bulbous
half like that of a man in spite of
the layers of fat that stream-lined
from it to the broad shoulders it did
have however two large staring
eyes and slitted holes inches below
them for nostrils-which showed
that it breathed air and was there-
fore warm-blooded

  quite motionless each stared at
the other while minutes passed
then the creature moved slowly up
and forward impelled by a grace-
ful and hardly perceptible roll of
its queer flippers very gradually it
came towards kenneth torrance
and he peering with fear-tinged cu-
riosity at the animals bold advance
saw two creases of fat that must
have been lips slide open in the
smooth brown face baring strong
pointed teeth

 not knowing whether it was an
attack okmerely inquisitiveness he
unsheathed his knife at this the fig-
ure stopped and poised motionless
again perhaps fifty feet away and
after a moment turned its sleek head
first to the left and then to the
right automatically ken gazed
around likewise he drew in his
breath with a sharp hiss

  like shadows additional figures
had appeared in the distant murk
silently they had come he could see
eleven-twelve-even more he was
surrounded no longer doubting
their purpose he gripped his knife
firmly he knew he could never get
down to the torpoon in time

  and then the circle began to close

there was little he could do to
resist them he realized for what
he had seen of their movements told
him that they were swift effortless
swimmers but he braced himself as
best he could against the dead
whale to protect his back he would
at least go down fighting

  as their spectral shapes slid slow-
ly closer he noted something that
had escaped his eyes before four or
five of them were holding dim ob-
jects in their arm-like flippers
spears he made them out to be
rudely fashioned from bone and
others held dark-colored loops
which they were slowly forming into
nooses

  theyre intelligent all right
ken muttered spears-of whale-
bone i guess and ropes-probably
seaweed weapons good lord
what kind of seals are these

  easily gracefully the silent circle
drew in to perhaps twenty feet of
him where they paused again hang-
ing motionless at regular intervals
in the eery wavering half-light ken
licked his lips nervously then the
one whom he had seen first moved
its head slightly in what was appar-
ently a signal and in a concerted
movement so bewilderingly rapid
that his eyes could not hold them
they rushed him

 he had expected speed but not
speed such as this he had barely
swung his kr if e-arm up when the
wave engulfed him

  doubling curving shapes looped
around him blubbery bodies pressed
against him eyes flashed by in
streaks of brown he knew that he
was being tumbled and tossed and
that his knife and hand-flash had
fallen under the shock of the attack
and then there was a sharper sensa-
tion as he struggled to break free
taut cords trussed hij legs and arms
like any captive animals

 the stream of moving bodies
slowed in movement and fell back
from a breathless dazed kenneth


astounding stories

torrance he then got his first clear
view-since the assault was unleashed

  he was upright many feet away
from the killer whales carcass his
arms bound strongly to his sides with
seaweed-rope his legs locked close
together to one side he glimpsed
several of the creatures fastening
other rope strands to the whales
flukes when they had finished with
smoothly thrusting flippers they be-
gan to haul the carcass forward and
he felt himself move feet first in the
same direction

  he forced a wry smile to his lipb
a swell fight i put up he grunted
hold em off yeah-i bet i held
em for a full tenth of a second

he still could hardly believe
what had so rapidly befallen
him it was difficult to credit eyes
that showed him creatures whose
bodies were mainly seal-like and yet
whose weapons and coordinated
movements spoke for human intelli-
gence but they were certainly real
at his feet he could feel the pressure
of a guards flippers against him

  he was towed in this fashion for
some distance when the pressure of
the flippers suddenly tightened and
he was pulled into a deep-angled
swoop toward the sea-bottom below
previously he had seen his captors
amazing speed but now he felt it
down and down he went and at last
when it seemed he must crash into
the sea floor his momentum was
quickly checked and he found him-
self standing in the mud from which
position lacking support from his
guard he drifted to a horizontal one
face up and there lying helpless
on the bottom he saw the reason for
the sudden dive far to the right
piercing faintly through the murk
were two faint interweaving beams
of white that preceded a slowly mov-
ing dark bulk

  the narwhal wild hopes of res-
cue coursed through him

  dimly as he watched the beams

he was aware of the rest of the crea-
tures dropping down guiding be-
tween them the whales carcass then
a firm pressure was applied to his
side and he was rolled over face
down in the mud unable any longer
to see his ship his momentary vision
of rescue vanished

  hopeless i guess he muttered
despairingly the darkness on the
sea-floor was too thick the waver-
ing shadows too deceptive and his
hand-flash and knife were gone-
probably knocked from his grasp
during the struggle i thought

  he realized that the seal-like ani-
mals were lying low until the sub-
marine passed its size having awed
them the color of the bodies
blended perfectly with the gloom as
did that of his own sea-suit his
bonds prevented him from making
even the slightest movement to at-
tract attention

  torturing thoughts raced through
the torpooners brain he saw in his
minds eye straight above a hazy
bulk with shimmering columns of
white angling from its nose his
imagination pictured for him the
warm well-lit interior and the bunks
-the coffee steaming on the fire the
men at their posts and streights
anxious beefy face he saw it all as
plainly as if he were inside crack-
ing jokes with one of the engineers

the minutes passed the nar-
whal must now be gone kens
cheek muscles stood out as he
pressed his teeth together well go
on he exploded in impotent rage
what are you waiting for kill me
eat me if youre going to and he
cursed the silent forms around him
till his ears hurt from the reverbera-
tion

  after the narwhal had vanished in
the gloom the torpooners captors
lifted him from the bottom and pro-
pelled him leisurely forward again
the slight graceful roll of their flip-
pers slipping them along smoothly
seed of the arctic ice



  a dull hopelessness came over him
ho longer could he hope that his
submarine would find him only one
thing was certain and that was that
death would soon come for even if
his captors did not kill him at once
he had but thirty-six hours before
his air-units would be exhausted
certainly having captured him the
seal-creatures would not release him
and it was too much to expect them
to realize that his sea-unit was only
an artificial covering which enabled
him to live underwater and not his
own flesh and blood

  and as for the chance of break-
ing loose-the idea was laughable
his speed was snail-like in compari-
son with theirs even if he did man-
age somehow to get away what good
would it do how could he a puny
helpless mite ever hope to locate
the narwhal in this vast sweep of
arctic sea his torpoon was
wrecked and he had no means of
communication

  his situation was quite hopeless

far ahead a dark shape grew in
the foggy murk and as they
neared spread upwards and out-
wards they angled up and up the
sea-floor was higher there ken
peering as best he could made out
that the mountainous looming bulk
was the face of a giant underwater
mound whose uneven formation in-
dicated that it was the result of some
long-past upheaval it was the first
of a rolling series of sh hillocks
six or seven in all strlhrng back
into the gloom their rounded peaks
reached to within a few feet of the
waters ice-sheathed surface surely
the creatures home was among these
mounds

  he was skirted round the base of
the first hillock and caught a glimpse
of something in its face which was
apparently of his captors construc-
tion it was a hole dark mysterious
perhaps fifteen feet in diameter and
barring it were three great gray

stakes reaching from top to bottom
behind the stakes ken got a
jumbled impression of a body large
and sleek of black streaked with
white that moved restlessly back
and forth in the hole and occasion-
ally seemed to lash out in anger he
wondered what it was before long
he knew

  the party of seal-creatures stopped
before the second of the row of hil-
locks in its face too was a hole-
a well of blackness-but with no
stakes across it he twisted his head
back and saw the carcass of the
killer whale he had slain being
guided up to the entrance and shoved
through then from the upper rim
of the hole three stakes similar to
the others he had seen slid down
and barred it

 storehouses he muttered
storehouses ill bet anything and
killer whales are their food they
keep em in the holes until theyre
needed but ill swear it was a live
whale i saw in the first one-and
how in the dickens could they cap-
ture a mighty killer with their dinky
spears and ropes

  there he had to leave the ques-
tion for its answer implied greater
intelligence in the creatures than he
would admit

  intelligence-in seals

  and now he was guided smoothly
forward to the third hillock where
the leaders of the group glided
through a v-shaped cleft in its face
his guards brought him along be-
hind

  a wry smile twisted kenneth tor-
rances lips to him the cleft was
more than an entranceway to him
it signified the beginning of the
hopeless lonely end of his life   

the cleft led into a corridor and
the corridor was softly illumi-
nated with a peculiar light whose
source he could not discover it
served to show him a passageway
that was wide rather than tall and


astounding stories

gouged from the firm clayey soil by
blunt tools that had left uneven
marks straight ahead it led and as
they continued the mysterious illu-
mination brightened until suddenly
rounding a turn its source appeared

  like will-o-the-wisps a score of
arrows of light flashed softly into
view down the corridor they were
of delicate green and orange and
yellow glowing and luminous and
hovering like humming birds be-
tween floor and ceiling ken looked
at them in some alarm until his
nearer approach showed him what
they were and then he exclaimed in
amazement

  why-theyre fish living elec-
tric bulbs

  a school of slender ten-inch fish
they were each one a radiant shim-
mering lacey-finned gem of orange
or green or yellow in concert they
shot to the ceiling over the party of
seal-creatures who still swam im-
passively ahead paying no attention
to them and from there scattered in
quick darts in all directions shower-
ing the cortege with washes of spec-
tral luminosity then the corridor
crooked again and with one simul-
taneous movement they were gone
and the scene that lay revealed be-
fore kenneth torrance took his
breath from him

  in the passageway he had seen a
score of the living jewels now he
beheld hundreds he peered up at
a shimmering sheet of brilliance
composed of hundreds of the slen-
der refulgent fish all swimming in
slow rotation below them was a
large cavern which he guessed had
been created by hollowing out one of
the underwater hillocks the sides
were rounded and pitted with holes
that represented other passageways
showing dark against the luminosity
from above and streaming out from
these dark holes of corridors came
dozens of the seal-creatures gather-
ing in response to some unheard un-
seen signal that had called them to

witness the strange captive their fel-
lows had brought in   

kens guards gripped him more
firmly and he was guided for-
ward and downward to the smooth
black floor of soil

  scores of large placid eyes stared
at hiqrfrom the slowly undulating
brown skinned bodies packed close
about him the sight was so weird
so beyond his imagination that he
laughed a little hysterically

  dreaming he said dreaming
but what a dream

  silently a space cleared in the cen-
ter of the horde his bonds were
taken away the guards released his
arms and he righted himself and
stood there on braced legs the ob-
ject of a concerted gaze

  this the torpooner felt was the
crucial period something was about
to be decided if it looked bad he
would make a wild-and of course
futile-break for freedom and die
quickly when they punctured his
suit but meanwhile he would stick
things out anything might happen
in that fantastic convocation

  there came a stir in the tiers of
brown bodies an aisle cleared and
down it a single seal-creature glided
slowly towards ken torrance-un-
doubtedly the leader of the herd
ruler of the underwater labyrinth

  gracefully the creature glided up
to the lone human and when only a
foot away extended one of its long
upper flippers so that its webbed edge
rested on his sea-suits casque and
its placid brown eyes hung close to
the face-shield and gazed through
inquisitively intelligently intelli-
gently no longer did kenneth tor-
rance doubt that as he held abso-
lutely motionless under the close-
searching scrutiny his brain rang
with the conviction that this crea-
ture this thing of blubbery body and
long webbed flipper-arms and legs
-this brown-skinned denizen of the
arctic underseas was with all its
seed of the arctic ice



fellows related to him a man of the
upper world

  men they were or rather blubber-
men

previously he had marveled
at something suggestively hu-
man-like in their appearance now
he recognized human intelligence in
his observers peering brown eyes
and questing movements of the flip-
per over his head casque and suit
warm red blood flowed in its blub-
ber-sheathed body an intelligent
brain lay in the fat round head and
why not

  whales ages ago were land mam-
mals animals that walked on the soil
of the dim early world they had
taken to the seas in quest of food
had stayed there and never returned
and nature had guarded their
bodies against the cold and great
depths by giving them layer upon
layer of oily blubber the ancestors
of these creatures before him might
well have lived on the soil walked
and run as he did then when the
ice came taken to the sea and made
a new home for themselves

  they had enticed the splendent
light-fish into their caverns to give
illumination intelligence almost
human a brain not as highly devel-
oped as mans but a human brain

 ken torrance had been almost
apathetic toward his eventual fate
but suddenly now a great hope
came to him-and twin with it on
its heels came fear if or since this
creature inspecting him had an in-
telligent human brain in some way
he might be able to correspond with
it he might be able to show that his
real body was inside the sea-suit
that he had to have air that he would
die if he were kept underwater that
he could not survive as a prisoner
these creatures appeared to be
friendly seemed to wish him no
harm if he could show them that he
was a man of the upper world they
might let him go

  if he could do it he had to make
known to the herd leader that he
breathed air and that hed die if
they didnt release him at once on
that depended life and death

  ken trembled as he cast about for
some way of putting over his idea
and then the plan came smiling
through his face-shield at the brown
eyes so close he drew back slowly
and took out a short steel crowbar
from the belt at his waist he bent
over and made a line on the soft
floor

all eyes watched him every
creature held motionless ap-
parently interested eager to under-
stand under his suit-clad figure the
crowbar traced a rude outline of a
man in a sea-suit the torpooner
pointed to the drawing and then
fingered his suit repeating the ges-
ture several times then he drew an-
other figure in the soil this one in-
tended to represent him without the
sea-suit it was not as bulky the
features were sharper and thinner
ken pointed to the twin dots stand-
ing for eyes then tapped his face-
shield he did this again and again

  for a moment the leader did not
move but then he slid forward and
stared through the shield rapidly
ken opened and closed his eyes and
pointed again to the dots on the
drawings faces-

  eyes eyes he said excitedly
voicing the thought his brain was
making eyes-inside the suit the
suits not me im inside eyes he
waited for a reaction tense and
strained the blubber-man reached
out one flipper-arm and took the steel
bar from his hand

  a thrill ran through him as the
creature dipped its body down and
began to draw in the soil labori-
ously crudely he outlined another
sea-suit and on the circle represent-
ing the face-shield marked two dots
-eyes

  hes getting it ken cried


astounding stories

  the blubber-man went on drawing
he sketched a second suit similar
in all respects and looked up at the
torpooner inquiringly it seemed

  ken nodded rapidly he tapped
the drawings then his suit nodded
again the ideas over he told
himself now ill make a move to-
wards that corridor to show them
that i want to go and if-

  but before he could stir the leader
of the blubber-men with one quick
gesture summoned two creatures
from the innermost circle swiftly
they placed themselves alongside
kenneth torrance lifted him and
bore him forward right across the
cavern to another of the passageway-
entrances

  it was so sudden that for a mo-
ment ken could not think clearly
what had happened were they re-
leasing him or was he still to be
kept a prisoner no doubt the lat-
ter and he had been so sure that
he was communicating with the
blubber-mans brain

  his lips pressed tight in a hard
white line it was a tough blow to
take

  well thats that he said it
was all imagination

  he did not know that his drawings
had signified something to the leader
of the herd-that each had mistaken
the meaning of the other nor did
he have any inkling of the greatest
surprise of all that now lay just be-
fore him

the surprise lay in another
cavern

  a quick turn through a cleft-like
entrance brought them into it the
room was only a fraction of the size
of the central meeting place and its
light from but several of the light-
fish was dim and vague barely en-
abling ken to see what looked like
a pile of rocks in the chamber heap-
ing upwards the ceiling was flat
and strangely blurred a rippling
veil as he wondered what caused

this his guards lifted him rapidly

towards it up alongside the rocks

  not only towards it but through
it his head-casque pierced through
rivulets of water gurgled off it-and
he realized that the blurred veil he
had seen was the top plane of the
water which only filled three-quar-
ters of the cavern

  surprise left him breathless at
first he could see nothing could only
feel that his shoulders were above
water then he was pushed slowly
upward until he rested almost com-
pletely above the surface how did
the cavern come to be but part-filled
with water he wondered and was
this dim emptiness around him air
could he breathe it

  then he was vaguely aware of a
presence on the top of the rock heap
he sensed rather than heard a stir
of movement then suddenly a ray
of light stabbed through the dark-
ness and impinged on his head-
casque--white electric man-made
light

  and there came to his ears muffled
by the suit and distorted by echoes
a call that sounded like his own
name

  ken is it you ken

  bewildered he motioned the
blinding light to one side it turned
upward and backward and in its
glare a face suddenly appeared out
of the darkness

  good god kenneth torrance
cried

it was a pale drawn face stubbled
with beard and its eyes were wild

  it was the face of chanley bed-
does the lost second torpooner of
the narwhal

ken stared his body rigid chan
beddoes the dead brought
back so it at first seemed and
here in a cavern of the blubber-men

  he pulled himself further up on
the rock pile unfastened the clasps
on his helmet and took it off-for
beddoes wore none and that meant
seed of the arctic ice



the space was filled with breathable
air

  chan he said and we were
sure you were dead

  a high-pitched hysterical voice
cried in answer

  its you ken they got you too
oh but its good to see you its
been so lonely so dark  you are
there ken im not just dreaming
again

  ken realized that the others
nerves were shot and he replied
gently

  youre not dreaming chan im
here with you now steady take it
easy lord this air-its pretty foul
but it smells good to me and itll
save our units how ever do they get
it down here he asked the ques-
tion in hope of steadying beddoes
giving his mind something definite
to occupy it

  a soft ripple sounded just then
looking round ken saw that his two
guards had slipped back beneath the
water leaving them alone

  chan beddoes helmet was off but
the rest of his body was still clad in
a sea-suit he half squatted on the
rocks his face raised and peering at
the first torpooner fearfully as if
afraid he would disappear as sud-
denly as he had come the beam of
light came from a hand-flash held in
his hand scattered around were
pieces of whitish meat-fish-and the
air was sickening with its smell ten
feet above was the chambers domed
ceiling from which water kept drip-
ping to the slimy rocks below

  air repeated beddoes stupid-
ly his mind was obviously affected
they fetch it from the surface with
eal-hide bags and release it they
change it often all over the caverns
they have to breathe too i think
they sleep in rooms like this his
voice rose with hysteria ken
theyre seals and yet theyre human
human down here they have arms
and legs and they breathe air like
whales-and theyve kept me here

for weeks years-i dont know
theyre devils its been so dark and
cold and-and- he began to cough
painfully

  i know ken told him sympa-
thetically steady man how did
you get here how did they catch
you

beddoes eyes wandered he
sucked his lips

  i cant remember he said no
yes we left the narwhal both of
us chasing those killers they broke
up and we went after different ones
and i lost sight of you

  i chased mine for a long time
and when i fired i only wounded
him he went like hell and i after
him after half an hour i was ready
to give up i couldnt get close
enough god ready to return to
the submarine to life

  his voice broke and he paused un-
til he was able to go on

  then i saw another shape ahead
of the whale a queer looking thing
-one of these human seals though
i didnt know it then it seemed to
be fleeing from the killer just as the
killer was from me there was some-
thing big and dark ahead-a shadow
i thought and kept my eyes on the
whale and the next second my tor-
poon crashed and i was knocked
cold

  its a deliberate scheme he went
on at a tangent the seal things
get a killer chasing them and lead
it towards the traps theyve got in
the sides of these hillocks they dart
in and the whale follows then bars
drop over the entrance and theyve
got the killer trapped they eat
them

  but how does the blubber-man
get out ken asked

  beddoes scowled oh theyre
clever enough a passage runs off
the trap big enough for the seal
thing but not for a killer    well
my torp had gone into the trap and
was stuck in one of the walls when


astounding stories

i came to i reversed my engines full
but i couldnt get free the impact
had ruined my radio

  through the after peep-holes i
could make out the killer in the trap
with me lashing around like mad
the bars over the entrance were
wide-spaced enough to let the torp
squeeze through-but i couldnt get
loose

 a s i lay there wondering what
jcjlto do i saw some more of
those blubber-men in the corridor
raising the bars they had long
spears and knives-and in ten min-
utes that killer was dead and the
place black with its blood

  well i thought i saw my chance
i got into my sea-suit thinking i
maybe could dig the torp free and
escape before the damned fish caught
me i climbed out the port and was
hacking at the mud bank with my
crowbar when a rope slipped over
my head and they had me

  ken nodded they got me in the
same way he said

  and gave you the once-over in
the big room chan declared
youll get plenty more of that
for most of the mans narrative
his tone and manner had been sane
enough but now again he broke out
wildly

  and ive been here for days
weeks and nothing but fish to eat
and whale meat and pieces of ice
brought for me to drink and the
darkness and the fish smell god
its driven me crazy i cant stand it
any longer ken and i wont ive
got to get out right away or kill my-
self ive got to

  ken gripped his shoulders and
shook steady he said sharply
get control over yourself

  steady beddoes gasped you
dont know how long ive kept con-
trol waiting and hoping for a
chance one little chance to escape
why havent you tried before
dont they leave you alone here

  chanley beddoes laughed harsh-
ly just because you cant see them
you think that hell no put on
your helmet look down-down
under the water-and youll see a
guard at the entrance theres al-
ways one there-with a spear and
every now and then he comes up to
see what im doing but no matter
now that youre here we can make a
break youve still got your crow-
bar  they took mine away ive only
had my flash to work with

  in spite of his awful experience
and intolerable predicament ken
was getting drowsy he had been
through much he had been short on
sleep when he had started out never-
theless he forced himself to consider
their situation since the blubber--
men had kept chan beddoes a pris-
oner they would no doubt keep him
one likewise it did not mean imme-
diate death from suffocation for
there was air of a kind here and
food was brought but-imprison-
ment

all around him was damp dark-
ness the rocks they lay on
were jagged and slime coated them
all over and there were little pools
of water here and there gloom aw-
ful water beneath slimy rocks to lie
on raw whale meat to eat stench
of rotting fish imprisonment
weeks of this suddenly he felt deep
admiration for beddoes in having
clung to sanity so long

  yes he said slowly weve got
to get out but with that guard on
duty    whats your plan

  the other coughed long then be-
gan

  it all depends on whether theyve
moved my torpoon from the trap
where it stuck you didnt see it any-
where well its got to be still hi
the trap and weve got to get to it
itll carry both of us the whale that
led me into the trap is dead and we
can finish prying the torp loose with
your crowbar
seed of the arctic ice



  kea nodded but the guard
chanley beddoes said harshly
im going to kill it

  ken looked at him his pale drawn
face was contorted his hands
clenched and unclenched he re-
peated 

  yes kill it ive a score to settle
with these devils anyway ill take
him unawares one blowll do it i
its placed right then down the cor-
ridor and to the trap i think i re-
member the way

  ken thought it out and shook his
head

  whats the matter beddoes
asked

  wed better not he said not
yet and never if we can help it
why not beddoes cried in
great surprise

  dont you see they havent
really harmed us theyre friendly
yes theyve kept you prisoner and
theyll keep me too-but probably
they dont think thats any terrible
hardship for us and they dont real-
ize how much we want to get free
what will we do then beddoes
broke in impatiently

  when i see the leader again ive
got to get it over that we want to
be released its a better risk than
killing this guard anyway theyre
disposed to be friendly but if you
killed one thered be the devil to
pay ken paused and his eyes
closed he said wearily

  but im dog tired no sleep for
twenty hours let me sleep an hour
or two my headll be much clearer
and well talk it over

  chanley beddoes said nothing
ken yawned and stretched his body
as comfortably as he conld on the
slime-coated rocks daized from the
rush of amazing events his eyelids
closed at once and soon his breath-
ing settled into a regular beat

perhaps half an hour later a
shape moved in the dank gloom
of the underwater cavern the top

plane of water rippled softly little
wavelets eddied against the rocks
and whispered as the shape slipped
down underneath then there was
silence no movement and the water
again calmed into a black sheet
smooth as glass for minutes it
stayed so while kens deep regular
breathing stirred the air

 thea suddenly the waters calm
was broken through its rippling
waves the shape reappeared rivulets
streaming from it quickly hauling
itself up on the rocks it clambered
towards the sleeper for a moment it
paused then its helmet swung back
revealing chans tense pale face a
hand reached out and gripped the
sleepers arm a voice called

 ken wake up hurry

  even as the words reverberated in
the close bowl the black mirror of
water stirred once more something
pierced through and drifted idly on
the surface it was a large brown-
skinned shape apparently lifeless

 ken called chan anxiously
again

  the first torpooner stirred out of
the depths of slumber he mumbled
whats the matter

  weve got to shove off right now
quick put on your helmet

 kenneth torrance sat up and
peered through half-open eyes he
saw before him the face of chanley
beddoes wild and excited in one
hand he held the steel crowbar and
behind on the surface of the water
floated the motionless body of a
blubber-man its head beaten in
streamers of red trailing from it
ken said sharply

 you killed him after what i
told you you fool

  yes i killed him beddoes an-
swered brazenly what of it

 ken said nothing for a moment
bitter reproach trembled on his
tongue but he did not speak the
words for chans mind was all too
clearly on the thin line this side of
insanity he only said


astounding stories

  well youve forced the issue
and weve got to leave immediately
it may mean our death but lets for-
get it now-how much of your air-
units is left

  about two hours i lost a lot
through a leak

ken took half of his own store
of the little cells from his hel-
met ill share mine thatll give
us both sixteen hours all told-in
case we dont find your torpoon
youre sure they killed the whale in
that trap and you know the way
i think so said beddoes excited-
ly you follow me

  all right on helmets then
the clasps were fastened down
cutting them off from spoken com-
munication with each other ken
took the hand-flash and crowbar and
stuck them in his own belt and both
clumsy grotesque figures splashed
into the water vanished beneath its
surface and ducked under the
shadowy body of the dead blubber-
tnan

  below in the dim quarter-light
ken peered out of the entrance to
the cell chamber the corridor
seemed safe there being only the
distant colored streaks of light-fish
and occasionally even these disap-
peared leaving heaped shadows in
the darkened water he nodded to
beddoes and boldly they began their
flight

  their progress was nerve-racking-
ly slow in spite of their utmost exer-
tions the water that retarded them
at times contained unsuspected cur-
rents that destroyed their equilibri-
um and sent them stroking madly
with both hands to regain it far
different this than the swift effort-
less swimming of the blubber-men
their weighted feet stumbled often
on the floor of the passage and sev-
eral times they lost balance and fell
towards the sides each time that
this happened ken was struck with
the fear of ripping the fabric of his

sea-suit and all the time there was
the apprehension of imminent dis-
covery

  at last he saw beddoes wave an
arm and enter a dim cleft a few feet
ahead in the left side of the wall in
turn he floundered through-and
just in time from around a bend in
the corridor shortly ahead there
came two blubber-men in only a few
seconds they would pass the niche
the two humans had entered crow-
bar ready ken flattened himself
against the sidewall pulling his com-
panion back with him they waited

the seal-men passed by-two
sleek blubbery shapes flipper-
arms and legs weaving gracefully
bodies rolling slightly eyes appar-
ently directed ahead close

  they had escaped that time but
there was a disturbing thought in
kens mind-and in beddoes too
perhaps-as they resumed their slow-
motion flight down the second corri-
dor what if those two were going
to visit us in the cell-chamber once
they see the dead guard hell sure
will start to pop

  for a period that seemed to be
measured in hours they fought their
way forward through the retarding
pressure of the water the corridor
described a long curve they were
on the last stretch-and still no pur-
suit 

  if only the torps there ken
kept exclaiming in his thoughts
just that

  if only the torps there had
they come the right way he had to
trust that to the memory of bed-
does beddoes whose mind had
clearly been affected by his seven-
day nightmare    he shook his
head he dared not doubt

  they increased their pace a lit-
tle imagination stimulated their
weary muscles the narwhal men
of their own kind sun and air life
again ken could have shouted when
he saw his partner stop and gesture
seed of the arctic ice



excitedly before a dark spot in the
wall it could be nothing but the en-
trance to a trap

  he pressed forward flicking on
his flash and making sure by the
water-waved beam it threw but
beddoes was attending to some sight
down the corridor and suddenly he
pointed in fright the first tor-
pooner looked in the indicated di-
rection and saw what was meant

  approaching was a wave of men-
acing brown-skinned bodies stream-
ing swiftly through the passage
several abreast their escape had
been discovered the blubber-men
were coming

at once ken acted pushing chan
into the narrow opening and
scrambling after himself they
wormed along for several feet till
they emerged in a large dark cham-
ber at the far end of which was a
big circular entrance barred by three
great pale stakes they were cer-
tainly in a whale trap

 rapidly ken played his flash
around looking for the torp but it
was nowhere visible to one side was
an out-jutting rock with a niche be-
neath it it was a promising place
and he stumbled his way there fol-
lowed by the other

  it was then that a most peculiar
feeling came over him a feeling that
was instantly a surge of panic some-
thing else was in the trap his flash
arced around and up and what lay
revealed in its ray caused cold shiv-
ers to run down the backs of the two
men

  above them just over the three-
toothed outer entrance hung a black
sleek body white-striped head-on
it was and motionless eyeing them
a killer whale-alive-poised
for a lunge

  it barred the way to the outer en-
trance they could not retrace their
steps already the round brown head
of a bubber-man showed in the inner
entrance they were trapped front

and rear and confronted by the
deadliest animal in the sea

  a second they watched it frozen
immobile then the whales great
body curved and its flukes went up
and by purest instinct the men dove
for the niche at their feet head to
head they arrived in it and just in
time for the great jaws of the killer
barely missed their snap

  as the monster curved past the
swirling water of its passage nearly
dislodged the torpooners and they
made haste to jam themselves into
the crevice as tightly as they dared
for the safety of their suits

  the whale whipped around in a
narrow circle and returned its
pointed teeth gleamed as it snapped
shut its jaws and muzzled its hard
wicked snout into kens ribs again
it circled and streaked for the niche
and helpless kenneth torrance lay
there as the beast tried to slide its
head into it he felt more of the
terrifying nuzzling of the snout but
the creature could not dislodge him

  cant bring his teeth to bear he
muttered with a certain relief
niche isnt high enough were
safe i guess for a couple of min-
utes unless the blubber-men come
in and kill him like they did the one
chan followed last week

for several minutes- the sea-
beast continued its frantic at-
tempt to reach the two humans and
then its attacks became desultory
during one respite ken managed to
get up his flashlight and send its
beam out over the floor-and what
he discovered was the essence of
irony directly opposite on the floor
by the wall lay a familiar long slim
shape its stem tipped by rudder-
planes and propeller its metal flanks
gleaming in white ray the torpoon
and utterly useless-a heartbreak-
ing jest-unless they could reach it

  but a slight hope grew in the men
at its discovery they had come to
the right trap after all probably the


astounding stories

whale had dislodged the hell from
the wall with fluke-blows-possibly
too the blows had sprung its seams
and opened the engine-compartment
to water   

  ken occupied himself with the
problem of how to get to it it held
their only hope but with all his
racking his brains he could think of
no way but to make a rush for it if
he could get inside the torp lying
flat on the ground would be reason-
ably safe from the killer until he
could get it running

  through the face-shields he met
his companions eyes the same deci-
sion had come to both

  there was a tiny space of muddy
floor between them kent doused it
with light from the flash in the mud
with a forefinger he slowly traced
these words one at a time rubbing
each one out to make room for the
next

  i get torp kill whale with gun
only way i go i senior if fail you
try

  he looked at the other inquir-
ingly vigorously chanley beddoes
shook his head

  he smoothed over the last word
ken had marked and in its place in
the same fashion began

  no draw lots only fair

  yes it was fair and ken knew it
he wrote

 how

  the second torpooner scrabbled
around with his fingers presently
he unearthed something and appar-
ently satisfied showed them to ken
they were two pebbles of different
sizes beddoes pointed to the larger
he wrote

  large makes attempt

  again ken nodded he marked
other try keep killers attention
from time to time a long sleek
body slid down to them and edged
back and forth striving its best to
dislodge them with its blunt snout
after each failure it would return
to a position just over the outer en-

trance at the proper moment chan-
ley beddoes jumbled the pebbles in
his cupped hands and laid two fists
down on the mud

  unhesitatingly ken placed a fin-
ger on the left one

  beddoes turned and opened it it
was the smaller pebble

close as was his face-shield to
beddoes ken could not see
what his reaction was ken stretched
forth his hand and clumsily touched
his companions shoulder

  good hunting he said but
chan never heard that  

  the marked man peered out into
the trap the killer was circling
slowly in the escape hole the faces
of three or four blubber-men were
dimly visible they seemed to be
watching with interest

  there came a good moment when
the killer paused at the three bars of
its cell its head turned in exactly
the opposite direction from the two
torpooners beddoes seized the op-
portunity at once almost before
ken knew it he had rolled out of
the niche

  quickly he worked to his feet and
started pushing for his goal the
whale had not seen him arms and
legs straining he floundered slowly
ahead he nearly made it

  but the killer restlessly turning
saw him-and kenneth torrance
winced and cried out

  the black monster struck with
horrible beautiful grace it curved
down its snout caught chanley bed-
does square in the side and butted
him up and around and both disap-
peared in a swirl of water into the
inky shadows of the traps ceiling

  ken closgd his eyes he knew what
was hapfsning he could not move
but it came to him as he lay there
sick with horror that be would never
have a better chance than now while
the killer was occupied

  recklessly he forced himself out
of the niche up above there was
seed of the arctic ice



commotion a whirlpool of churning
water the current helped him he
got caught in it and was swept
sprawling right over to the tor-
poons side

he clutched at the port expect-
ing each instant the tear of
monster fangs but he made the in-
terior and clicked shut the port no
matter the water that had come into
the main compartment with his en-
trance he pulled the starter over
and heard the familiar drone of elec-
tric engines safe inside their water-
tight division he felt no relief at
this there was only the same sick
horror

  he raised the torpoon a little
there was one thing to do perhaps
it was mad to try to destroy that
killer whale in so narrow a space
but he was going to attempt it it
would not be so bad to join chan if
he failed   

  a terrific blow struck the stem
of the torpoon and spun it around
dizzily ken made out the killer lift-
ing its flukes for a second blow
quickly he sped the torp ahead and
turned as best he could flashing on
his powerful bow-beam he found the
killer to his left slightly above
carefully he maneuvered into firing
position then coldly with deadly
accuracy he centered the sights of
his nitro-shell gun on the vital spot
behind the eyes he pressed the trig-
ger again and yet again the pro-
jectiles hurtled out

 the monster started its beady
eyes settled on the torpoon with a
lunge it darted forward jaws gaping
wide and as it came another shell

sped true into the tooth-rimmed
mouth

  it halted then and doubled in the
water shook after shock shook the
torpoon as the shells exploded in the
whale for a little while the sea-
beast flurried and once or twice the
torp shivered from chance fluke-
blows but then at last came peace
the body rolled over showing its
white belly and drifted towards the
traps ceiling   

  the brown-skinned heads had dis-
appeared from the inner entrance
kenneth torrance glanced in that
direction for a last time ttfen looked
sadly around

  so long chan he murmured
so long

  the torpoon squeezed through the
bars of the outer entrance and sped
forth into the open sea

so it was that perhaps an hour
later the light-beams of the
whaling submarine narwhal dog-
gedly scouring the region where last
her first torpooner had been heard
from fell across a slim shape of
steel that was beating its way at full
speed through the foggy murk of the
arctic sea

  right up to the narwhal she came
swerving at the last moment and hov-
ering outside the starboard torpoon
catapult while aboard the subma-
rine an officer whose voice quivered
with excitement roused captain
henry streight from his bunk and
the men off duty gathered around
the inner catapult entrance-port

  quickly the outer port swung
open and the lone torpoon slid in-
slid home

the space rover

by edwin kc sloat

evan winford leaned
wearily against the controls
of the little space sphere
and stared out of the win-
dow at the planet mercury which
lay a million miles sunward fail
now he gritted his teeth no
he would wrench
victory from fate
after all even
though at this
moment mine
guards must be

young w inford heads a desperate
escape from the prison mines of
mercury

searching the nearby mountains for
him and his companions and a
warning was being broadcast to all
the planets and space ships to watch
rison tender ship the one
jjsed to transfer prisoners
s out in space to mercury
and its inter-
planetary council
prison mines to
which all who
were sentenced
came on one-way


the space rover

 

tickets only this was the first time
winford reflected grimly that the
sphere had ever carried outbound
passengers

  a long quavering wail sounded
from the hold below winford
scowled that fellow agar again
too bad for he was unquestionably
an engineering genius and thorough-
ly dependable when he didnt get one
of his spells and imagine he was a
godo-dog on the red steppes of his
native mars a little rest and gentle
treatment would unquestionably
work wonders again the wail fol-
lowed this time by a series of growls

  winford slid open the door that
separated the control nest from the
hold of the little prison tender ship
the other five men had withdrawn
to the other side of the cabin and
were watching listlessly the big
ragged barrel-chested martian
crouching on all fours against the
side of the cabin and ferociously
baring his teeth

  whats the matter down there
called winford sharply

six pairs of eyes looked up at
him agar forgot he was a dog
and stared with the rest they were
an unkempt ragged lot with un-
shaven faces and the dirty white
canvas uniforms of mine prisoners
the group was composed of four
martians and two venusians

  lets go back growled nizzo
whose squat powerful body and long
arms bespoke his venus ancestry
its death out here no food no
water excepting the emergency ra-
tion you have up there in the box
that will scarcely last till
reach mercury again
us that the fuel is
lets go back i say
to swing about the sun
our tomb for all eternity
we eat and drink at the mines even
though the whips of the drivers
hurry us on to an early death

  youre crazy nizzo harshly re-

torted winford you know what
they do when escaped prisoners are
brought back or come of their own
free will the universe knows noth-
ing of the caged saurians in the
wardens gardens nor of the incor-
rigible prisoners that go to feed
them but i know-we all of us
know far better to remain out here
and die whole than to be devoured
alive by a slobbering horror

  a heated argument ensued among
the men below presently nizzo
looked up again

  but you have no plan he
shouted at the earthman we have
followed you blindly so far and here
we are off the traffic lanes our only
hope of being picked up now is one
of space patrol ships and short
shrift may we expect from them
winford scowled impatiently
listen men he began this is
a desperate venture i know and i
picked every one of you carefully
you are not common scum of the
prison mines every man of you can
be depended upon to put throufca
daring escape of this nature
man of you is an innocent victim of
the rotten politicians and corrupt
officials that now hold sway in the
three planets take jarl there for
example he indicated a big pa-
tient resigned martian he is under
life sentence in the penal mines
simply because his brother-in-law
wanted his lands and wealth as for
myself i had a sister who suffered
the misfortune of being seen and
coveted by silas teutoberg a mem-
ber of the earth council   

he choked at the thought his
pale face rigid with emotion
those below saw the flash of his
lambent eyes he controlled himself
with an effort and continued

  i have said nothing of any plan
beyond that of making our escape in
this prison tender off mercury but
i had a plan behind that it is true
that we seem to be off the regular


astounding stories

traffic lanes but space liners between
venus and earth just now are cut-
ting in quite close to mercury due
to the position of the three planets
in their orbits this formed the basis
of the whole venture

  during the three interplanetary
days we have floated out here i have
repeatedly scanned the void think-
ing every minute we would sight a
craft we could reach but so far luck
has been against us all i ask is that
you do not allow yourselves to be
discouraged for sooner or later
well get a break

  a chorus of enthusiastic approval
answered him winford sighed with
relief then stared abruptly through
the window and gave a shout the
others below swarmed up the ladder
and crowded into the tiny control
nest winford pointed

  far off against the black depths of
space toward venus gleamed the
tiny elliptical silvery hull of a ship
bearing slightly toward them al-
though sharply outlined the craft
was hundreds of miles away as the
men realized winford checked it
swiftly through the telescope dis-
tance calculator determined its
speed and rapidly formed his plan

  there are plenty of space suits
in the lockers he said tersely get
into them stand by the air-lock
you jarl get into the lock and take
a cable with an electro-magnet an-
chor lash yourself to it when i
give the signal by blinking the
lights in the lock open the outer
door and leap across to the other
ship i know you risk death from
their rays but it is our only chance
clamp the anchor against the side of
the ship and locate the emergency
entrance lock

  suppose there is none inter-
rupted jarl stoically

  chances are there will be the
interplanetary treaties call for them
on most ships since those five hun-
dred passengers perished trying
vainly to enter a liner after their

own ship was smashed by a meteor
out near jupiter several years ago
anyway its our only chance you
nizzo and ragna enter the air-lock
with jarl so that if he misses you
can pull him back now hurry ill
have to maneuver this tub around so
that i can approach the ship if pos-
sible without being noticed

the others scuttled back down
the ladder leaving winford to
rapidly work out his final calcula-
tions the ship traveling at a rate
of six thousand miles an hour would
miss their little sphere by about a
hundred miles the ship was prob-
ably a slow speed freighter a guess
that was supported by the lack of
port-holes in the hull

  it was a ticklish task that winford
faced he could either approach the
freighter from against the sun trust-
ing that the navigation officer on
duty would fail to notice the dark
blot of the little tender against the
blinding glare or he could get on
the far side of the ship and approach
it concealed by its black shadow he
decided on the latter plan

  the freighter was coming up fast
winford eased the accelerator open
and moved off at right angles to its
line of progress to place it between
him and the sun if the officer in
charge of the freighter should see
the tiny dot go shooting presently
across his path he would doubtless
mistake it for a wandering meteor
as soon as he crossed the path of the
big ship winford slowly turned his
little craft toward the protecting
shadow of his prospective victim
aridlilcked up speed as quickly as
hftaieaifefcbntil the little tender was
traveffinfpsfe the same speed as the
frcfjjippteucky it was for him that
the tug craft was not a mail liner
for if it had been the little ball
could never have gained speed
enough to equal it

  the shadow of the freighter pres-
ently enveloped the little ship and
the space rover



the two hung side by side winford
eased the tender in toward the big
craft fully realizing that the meteor
warning dial in the control room of
the freighter would hint at his pres-
ence by its pronounced fluctuation
but there was no help for it he
could only take the chance that the
navigator in charge would not in-
vestigate winford peered up anx-
iously at the windows of the control
room apparently the little craft had
not yet been discovered

less than a hundred yards now
separated the two craft win-
ford flashed his signal to the air-
lock a moment later a dark blob
that shut off the light of the stars
in depths below floated across the
gap from the tender to the freighter
the electric meter on the control
board registered a sudden fluctua-
tion as the electro-magnet anchor at-
tached itself to the hull of the big
ship

  winford snapped off the propul-
sion beams seized two ray pistols
that lay on the chart table and
ducked down the ladder his com-
panions were standing before the
inner door of the air-lock in their
bulging space suits awaiting his or-
der to leave the tender he quickly
got into a suit clamped on the hel-
met and screwed tight the connec-
tions then he opened the door of
the air-lock and motioned the others
into it following the last man in

  nizzo and ragna were waiting
there and as the inner door closed
automatically opening the outer
door they pointed to the cable
stretching away across fogljgwfcrds
of empty space to the
freighter winford slpvphpbut
faintly the form of jhhjljfipppas
clambering cautiously ofiimboulg-
ing side of the ship on hands and
knees seeking the emergency air-
lock winford beckoned to the
others to follow and leaped out into
space along the cable

  it was a terrifying experience for
no matter how often a man made
such a trip there was always the
primitive fear of falling into those
millions upon millions of miles of
space below where the stars gleamed
red green white and blue in the
cold depths yet a man had no
weight he merely pulled himself
along the cable which kept him
from getting lost

  he reached the bulging side of the
hull and continued upward on hands
and knees now held to it by its own
attraction for his body the others
followed and scattered out seeking
the emergency entrance lock

at the end of an hour they were
in despair there was no emer-
gency entrance lock winford bit-
terly resigned himself to their fate
this was the end of their daring at-
tempt he must go forward now to
the control room windows and at-
tract the attention of the navigating
officer it meant surrender and sub-
sequent death in the teeth of the
caged saurians but if they remained
much longer where they were they
would freeze to death anyway for
the batteries that warmed their suits
were running down under the con-
tinued strain and when they ceaseds
to function the deadly cold of inter-
stellar space would claim them he
managed to make known his inten-
tions to the others and was starting
forward when fate took a hand

  the prison tender ship which was
still floating at the end of its cable
at the side of the freighter relin-
quished itself to the play of the
forces that rule the measureless void
and began to set up an orbit of its
own about the bigger ship it came
to the end of its tether and swung
gently against the hull of the
freighter sending a violent vibra-
tion through it then it rebounded
and struck with another crash which
was utterly soundless to the strand-
ed men on the outside of the hull


astounding stories

who nevertheless felt the vibration
plainly

 winford halted abruptly the
crew inside the ship would investi-
gate fate was offering the desperate
men on the outside another chance
he turned and beckoned to the others
and hurried aft toward the regular
air-lock which was operated only
from inside the ship hastily he
placed the men about the outer door
then they waited

  five minutes later it opened and
two men in space suits crawled out
jarl captured the first man single-
handed and nizzo and ragna with
perfect teamwork overpowered the
second before he realized what was
taking place within a minute the
men crowded into the air-lock and
shut the outer portal automatically
the inner door slid open

  winford stepped out into the pas-
sageway with his ray pistols cover-
ing the half dozen members of the
crew who gaped at the intrudersin
speechless astonishment one man
recovered his wits and started to run
winfords pistol stabbed a ray after
him and he collapsed the other
members of the crew silently raised
their hands in surrender and were
herded into a nearby stateroom and
locked in including the two in space
suits who had been captured on the
hull outside

  overpower and imprison the crew
at once winford ordered as he
emerged from his space suit jarl
you take charge and work through
the ship miss no one bind them
imprison them if you can and if
you must use sterner measures re-
member you are now pirates and if
we dont capture this ship the ship
will capture us ill go ahead alone
to the control room and introduce
myself to the officers there when
you have cleaned things up join me

captain robers was peer-
ing out through the window at
the dark blob of the space tender

near the rear of the big freighter
when the door of the control room
opened softly and winford slipped
inside with leveled ray pistols the
two navigation officers on duty
gasped in astonishment captain
robers whirled around his momen-
tary amazement gave way to wrath

  who the devil are you and what
do you want he bellowed

  winfords eyes blazed coldly the
ray pistols in his hands twitched
meaningly

  civility first captain hands off
those instruments gentlemen stand
up face the windows thank you
with catlike quickness winford
leaped behind the chart table a
glance showed that the ship was
holding to its course with unchecked
speed only the meteor detector fluc-
tuated from the presence of the little
space ship outside no worry there
distintegrator rays would soon dis-
solve it and with it the last visible
evidence of their presence on the
ship

 now captain you may turn
about facing me i want a little in-
formation

  youll sniff gas for this snarled
the officer this is piracy pure aftd
simple who are you anyway
winford smiled ironically cap-
tain robers eyes widened suddenly
and he paled slightly as he recog-
nized the dirty white uniform

  the mines of mercury he ejacu- 
lated we received a heliogram not
twenty-four hours ago warning us
of your escape youre evan win-
ford of earth

  winford bowed slightly

            service captain my six
ccbwfcare even now trussing
upybffhder of your crew down
choke captain you
are ftplimger unless you make it
yourselft i desire a little informa-
tion about the universe you see i
have been out of touch for the last
three years during my enforced so-
journ on mercury
the space- rover



  captain robers glared at winford

  tell me captain who are you
and what is this craft

  the officer thrust out his chin
stubbornly then glanced at the pis-
tol covering him and changed his
mind

  captain robers the freighter is
the golden fleece

  port

  new york i am homeward bound
with a cargo from ceres of the aster-
oids

  winfords eyes gleamed momen-
tarily

  iridium eh

captain robers declined to
answer the valuable metal
which was found mostly in abun-
dance among the asteroids and par-
ticularly on ceres had proved the
bait that lured pirates in flocks from
all parts of the universe to prey on
the freighters that carried it usu-
ally under heavy guard the golden
fleece had obviously been trying to
slip through under the camouflage
of an ordinary tramp freighter when
winford and his followers boarded
her robers saw no reason for trying
to lie about ceres since winford
would discover it later when he ex-
amined the log winford however
did not press the question about the
cargo

  who is the owner captain

  the interstellar transportation
company new york silas teuto-
berg president

  winford leaped to his feet

  repeat that name captain he
ordered harshly

  silas teutoberg suteeajjfeom-
plied the officer but djhhx-
cited he has

  a crafty light appearettjhskap-
tains eyes he sensed at ad-
vantage in retaining this knowledge
himself

  i decline to answer he stated

  the lambent flames leaped omi-

nously in winfords eyes he toyed
with the ray pistol expressively then
glanced up at a sudden interruption
the control room door had opened
admitting jarl and ragna

  the crew is all accounted for
announced jarl we imprisoned a
hundred men and have control
very good jarl replied win-
ford calmly ragna take these two
navigating officers down and lock
them up with the rest jarl you re-
main here i have a little task for
you

  awah replied jarl using the
martian term for very good sir
captain robers here is going to
strip off his clothing and pass out
through the air-lock into space
winford spoke each word with cold
precision

the officer jerked up his head in
sudden terror he had once wit-
nessed the modern equivalent for the
ancient piratical sentence of walking
the plank and the vivid memory rose
before him he saw again the nude
man cowering inside the air-lock as
the inner door shut the wafting out
into interstellar space of his strug-
gling body as the atmosphere inside
the lock rushed out of the outer
opening door and the fatal bloating
of the body from the sudden pres-
sure from within the horror of it
unlocked the officers tongue

   ill answer ill answer he cried
what do you want to know

  tell me why silas teutoberg is
resigning as president of the inter-
stellar transportation company

  in the momentary silence that fol-
lowed jarls eyes narrowed with
sudden intensity his interest es-
caped winford who was watching
robers closely the officer gulped
with relief

  teutoberg has been named gov-
ernor of the new emigration colonies
the united states is establishing on
ganymede he explained hurriedly
the earth council which recently


astounding stories

took over the most fertile provinces
on the third moon of jupiter with
the full approval of the interplane-
tary council has named him for the
post the position is nearly the same
as that of an absolute monarch but
he could not hold a government post
and retain his executive position
with the interstellar people so he

 	resigned

  winford eyed him skeptically
captain robers now greatly agi-
tated gestured frantically toward
the chart table

  i am telling you the truth he
assured winford fervently youll
find somewhere on the table a copy
of the heliogram news which tells
of his departure from new york less
than twelve hours ago in a specially
chartered liner with his staff and
friends for new chicago on gany-
mede it also tells of his approach-
ing marriage to princess irkeen
daughter of king donossus a politi-
cal marriage that will assure teuto-
bergs position with the natives

oor girl muttered winford
under his breath searching
among the loose papers on the chart
table for the copy of the news which
was received every twelve hours by
automatic helioprinter from new
york millions of miles away he
read the article about teutoberg
through and laid aside the paper
turning to the charts he jotted
down a few hasty calculations and
stepped to the controls where he set
a new course for the iron mike
of the space freighter to follow

  captain robers i have changed
my mind about having you go out
into space from the air-lock he an-
nounced turning again to the anx-
ious officer we will hold you pris-
oner with your men and later on will
set you down on one of jupiters
smaller satellites-callisto if pos-
sible since the living conditions
there are quite satisfactory word
will be sent to mars of where you

can be found all of your crew ex-
cepting those who wish to sign on
with me will be freed with you i
and my six companions are hardly
enough to operate such a craft as
this incidentally we are appropri-
ating the golden fleece and its
cargo if the interstellar people ob-
ject they may present the bill to
silas teutoberg and he can deduct
it from the income my property
yields him

  captain robers glanced up curi-
ously at the harsh bitterness that
crept into winfords voice then his
glance shifted to jarl and he was
amazed to see the malevolent expres-
sion that appeared on the martians
face as he listened to winfords
words the moment passed and jarl
silently escorted the officers below
to be locked up with the rest of his
crew

three weeks later earth time
the golden fleece slipped into
the atmosphere of callisto the
fourth satellite of mighty jupiter
which swung in its orbit a million
and a quarter miles from the great
planet far off to the west separated
by two million miles of empty space
floated ganymede the third satel-
lite on which the people of the
united states were now gaining a
foothold with their newly planted
colonies

  the big freighter under the engi-
neering genius of agar had made a
marvelously speedy journey from its
original position just outside the
orbit of mercury to this point nearly
four hundred and fifty million miles
awmjgmhe little planet winford
sttsgdground below he was
onljjpftfljacquainted with the
callisto and wanted
to bwbjmipick a spot where cap-
tain robers and his men could be
certain of surviving until help ar-
rived his eye picked out a satisfac-
tory spot close beside the gnan
river in one of the stunted conifer
the space rover



forfests of the planet swiftly he
dropped the big freighter until it
hovered but a few yards above the
ground

  a freight port-hole was opened
and captain robers accompanied by
half his crew prepared to descend
they were all bundled in heavy gar-
ments for the temperature of cal-
listo never high frequently drops
to subzero readings winford stood
at the port and watched the men
climb down the rope ladder to the
ground below

robers was last to go he
faced winford bitterly for
this escaped lifer from mercury had
stolen not only his ship but half his
crew as well and the prospect of a
liberal share of the rich iridium
cargo in the hold

  youll regret this day snarled
the captain ill be in the front row
of spectators when you sniff the
death gas in the glass execution
cage on mars hundreds have tried
this sort of thing before you and
every man of them has come finally
to the cage

  youre only delaying us captain
roberts replied winford coldly i
am in a hurry to be on my way
kindly move down the ladder and
join your men your hand weapons
and food supplies will be dropped
by parachute as we leave i might
add that in c short time i expect to
be in a position to broadcast an
sos message for you which should
bring rescue ships here to callisto
for you good-by

  he turned away leaving the offi-
cer to descend the ladder
fury to the ground bekwmherehis
men huddled togethesjflplpw-
miliar cold and stared fcalf fearful
at the far-away sun gttwffljf-like a
yellow arc-light in the depths of
space half a billion miles away

  when the rising ship reached the
thousand-foot level the weapons and
food were dropped by parachute and

the port-hole closed and locked
winford hurried forward to the con-
trol room where the two navigators
who had signed with him for a hun-
dred and twentieth share of the iri-
dium each were already pointing
the nose of the ship up through the
purple heavens toward ganymede

  open her up use the emergency
propulsion beams ordered win-
ford we are overdue now for my
tryst with this new governor at new
chicago

  the officers gazed at him in awe
wondering what desperate thing he
planned at the new colonial capital

inford was poring over
the maps of new chicago
six hours later in the chart room
when one of the navigation officers
touched him on the shoulder

  battle sphere rapidly overhaul-
ing us from sunward sir said the
man approaching us against the
glare of sunlight until it was so close
when we discovered it that escape is
now impossible id say it is one of
the new -q heavies of the inter-
planetary council patrol fleet
winford hurried tt the telescope
as his anxious eye took in the
spherical outline of the battle craft
showing as a silvery crescent to the
rear and starboard of them he recog-
nized it as one of the heavily armored
spheres of the interplanetary coun-
cils fleet with the new long range
k-ray disintegrator guns

  winford seized a telescope speed
calculator the sphere was coming
up far too rapidly to permit the
golden fleece to pick up speed soon
enough to escape-although he was
confident the freighter could do it
now since agar had changed its pro-
pulsion machinery

  perhaps the commander of the bat-
tle sphere was merely curious about
the golden fleece since it appeared
to be an ordinary tramp freighter
with no distinguishing emblems or
other identification and was coming
srr v vv v	   -  - -  	   - 



astounding stories

close to give her a better look or
perhaps he was hurrying to some
destination and his nearness to the
golden fleece was merely acciden-
tal

  whatever the cause there re-
mained but one thing to do and
that was to keep the freighter on its
course as though nothing out of the
ordinary was taking place winford
turned to the communication board
and cut in the universal radio wave
the instrument was silent he
sighed at least the commander of
the battle sphere was not trying to
communicate with him

  winford turned back to the win-
dow again the sphere was quite
close now and its speed was drop-
ping rapidly suddenly the radio
loud-speaker hummed to life

  ahoy there aboard the freight-
er sounded a stern determined
voice this is the interplanetary
council battle sphere eagle near-
ing you we are coming aboard you
to investigate make ready your air-
lock to receive us attempt nothing
hostile hundred-kilowatt ray guns
are trained on you

w

inford cut in the micro-
phone and answered with the
customary o k reply then he
turned to the two white-faced navi-
gators

  carry on as usual he said grim-
ly perhaps we can fool them once
they are aboard

  then he turned to the phone con-
necting with the crews quarters he
hurriedly explained the situation to
jarl and instructed him to receive
the boarding party at the air-lock

  the big battle sphere was drawing
close alongside magnet grapnels
shot across the narrow space be-
tween the two craft and gripped the
side of the freighter followed by
the cable bridge along which the
hoarding party presently came
vavering their way to the air-lock
f the freighter

   winford counted fifty men then
 turned away dejectedly this was no
 ordinary inspection party but a
 prize crew coming aboard he sat
 down wearily just as victory seemed
 almost within his grasp-had been
 actually in his hand when he had
 started to ganymede-this battle
 sphere popped up out of nowhere
 like an inescapable doom to strike
 him and his companions down he
 gritted his teeth some way some-
 how he would still win out he and
 his fellows had come too far to be
 cheated of liberty now

  the door of the control room
opened and a smart young officer in
gold and gray of the interplanetary
council marine service entered ac-
companied by three privates with
drawn pistols who took their posi-
tions near the door winford noted
the clean-cut lines and fresh features
of the officer and felt that under dif-
ferent circumstances he would like
to know him

  i am lieutenant commander
-a the officer introduced him-
self using the designation the in-
terplanetary council required of all
their fighting men you are evan
winford are you not

  winford nodded

  you nearly got away with it
winford complimented the officer
with a boyish grin i almost admire
you for it but you made at least
one fatal error

  what was that asked winford
curiously

  when you put captain robers
and his men off this ship they smug-
gled out with them a hand-operated
heliot each man carried a part
withufcj hour after you left they
had rkpsftffted and were cranking
our s o signals we happened to
be but ftfiiffllion miles off callisto
and picked up their message at once
our commander decided to start out
and rope in the golden fleece be-
fore you did any further damage

  and here we are
the space rover



inford cursed himself un-
der his breath fool that he
had- been not to have had the men
and their baggage searched more
carefully before he allowed them to
leave the freighter nizzo was re-
sponsible for that he should be-
but it was too late now no use cry-
ing over spilled milk he forced a
grin and shrugged

   the best laid plans of mice and
men-  he quoted philosophically
i hope the entire blame for this
wild venture is put on my shoulders
where it belongs when we are
brought to trial these two naviga-
tors here and the rest of the men
are in no way responsible i forced
every man of them under pain of
death to join me

  the young officer shook his head
and smiled

  not a chance of that winford
voull all stand trial alike and you
know it you are rather a strange
sort of pirate it seems to me to offer
yourself as a sacrifice for your men
id say you are too tender-hearted
for buccaneering in the void

  if i had succeeded in reaching
new chicago you might have
gained a different impression of
me retorted winford his lambent
eyes flaming at the thought i have
sworn to kill silas teutoberg the
new governor of ganymede because
he sent me to die in the mines of
mercury for a crime i never com-
mitted

  the young officer laughed

  you can set your mind at rest
about him winford he was due at
new chicago five days ago in his
specially chartered space liner from
new york nothing was hearjl from
his ship ten days after ihjfwnew
york with his guests aboard his
last reported position was near the
mars orbit and since then nothing
has come out of the void theyll
just chalk him under the lost in
space column on the admiralty
boards of the universe and give the

credit for his disappearance to some
hurtling meteor we were on our
way to search for the remains of his
liner when we intercepted the mes-
sages from captain robers and his
men on callisto

infords face was bleak
fate has prevented me from
achieving my greatest desire he
said harshly to rid the universe
of that scourge to humanity would
have been one of the sweetest mo-
ments of my life ive dreamed of it
for years

  the officer lighted a cigarette

  perhaps you are right but id
say the chance is gone in more ways
than one teutoberg is undoubtedly
dead and you are on your way to the
gas execution cage on mars inci-
dentally you are now my prisoner
ill not lock you in the hold with
the rest of your crew but will con-
fine you to your stateroom

  winford surveyed him curiously

  i warn you that ill take advan-
tage of any opportunity to escape
he said

  the officer grinned

  thats to be expected so would
any other man doomed to die but
the coronium doors locks and walls
of the golden fleeces staterooms
are practically escape proof and
with two of my marines on guard
outside your door with orders to kill
if you break out i feel reasonably
safe

  imprisoned in his stateroom win-
ford threw himself on his bunk too
early to attempt anything yet he
considered it would be better to
wait a few days-at least until eagle
had departed besides he would
have to work out a plan for escape

  he glanced up at the port-hole
the sunlight was shifting he arose
and peered out twenty-five miles
away he could see the battle sphere
standing out across the void on a
sunward course the golden fleece
was turning her nose toward distant


astounding stories

mars a long journey since the red
planet was on the opposite side of
the sun seven hundred million miles
away

 winford knew what was taking
place the commander of the battle
sphere was again resuming his mis-
sion of searching for the missing
liner while the young officer and his
crew were taking the golden fleece
with its iridium cargo and pirate
crew directly to mars

 meantime the radio and audio-
vision announcers on all the planets
were broadcasting the sensational
news of the capture of the escaped
convict-pirates and their forthcom-
ing trial and certain execution on
mars winford turned bitterly away
from the port-hole

one week had passed winford
started up out of a sound sleep
he listened tensely there was a
murmur through the big freighter
he recognized it as the clanging of
the great alarm gongs through the
hull of the big ship muffled by the
walls of his stateroom something
was afoot

  he threw off the covers sprang
out on the deck and pulled on his
clothes this might be a break
those gongs never sounded without
plenty of cause

 he pulled a chair to the door
mounted it and cautiously opening
the transom which he had previously
loosened thrust his head out into the
passage

 a marine was running down the
passage the guards before win-
fords door tried to stop him but the
man ran on presently another came
along the guard was more success-
ful

  say buddie whats all the ex-
citement he demanded

 weve found teutobergs liner
or rather it has found us ex-
claimed the marine they say old
teutoberg has trained his heaviest
guns on us and is demanding that

we surrender our skipper doesnt
know just what to make of it hes
arguing with teutoberg by radio
that this old tub is in the hands of
the law already and that he is taking
it to mars for the piracy court teu-
toberg says he wont be fooled by
any such bunk as that he knows we
are all pirates and he is going to
have this ship regardless of any-
thing since it belongs to his line
ive got to be hurrying along were
getting the big guns ready the few
that we have

  winford cautiously withdrew his
head his eyes were glowing the
whole scheme was as plain as day
now teutoberg knew as well as
every informed person in the uni-
verse did that the golden fleece
was in the hands of the interplane-
tary council marines that talk
about being entitled to the freighter
because it was owned by his ship-
ping line was so much rubbish he
was protected by insurance what
he wanted was the insurance and the
ten million dollars worth of irid-
ium in the hold as well

  furthermore he had intended to
have it all along it was part of his
diabolical scheme to put the ship-
ment on an unprotected freighter
then he had chartered a liner pri-
vately for his venture in piracy
when the liner was lost he was
out searching for the golden fleece
along the lanes where it should have
been had not he winford and his
companions captured the craft and
sent it hurtling out toward gany-
mede and now teutoberg had suc-
ceeded in trailing it down

t xinford surveyed the tran-
vvssnu pessimistically impos-
sible to get through it if only he
had a ray pistol to dissolve the door
lock    the air ventilator he
dropped down on hands and knees
and peered under the bunk the
opening seemed large enough to let
his shoulders through if he should
the space rover



become fast in one of the turns of
the tunnel it would be all up with
him theyd probably find his body
when the ship went into dock for
repairs but this was no time to
think of that

  he crawled under the bunk took
out the grating and set it beside the
opening then he wormed his way
into the tunnel it was a tight fit
but he could move the first turn
should bring him to the branch that
opened out on the passage not far
from his stateroom door

  never would he forget that strug-
gle when he forced his cramped tor-
tured body round the bend in the
blackness a fraction of an inch at a
time and crawled up the branch if
he was mistaken-but he wasnt
presently he was looking out of the
grating into the passage

 members of the crew raced back
and forth like disturbed ants from
the snatches of conversation that
reached him winford learned that
teutoberg had succeeded in getting
the range of the freighter and was
holding her helpless under the im-
posing muzzles of his heavy disinte-
grator-ray guns

 the door of the control opened
and the boyish commander his face
pale and drawn thrust out his head

  theyre coming aboard men he
shouted to the group in the passage
below i cant stop them our only
chance may come after they are
aboard

  why dont you free the pirates
and let them help us cried one of
the men

  never returned the young com-
mander firmly they are in our
care and by the gods we are going
to bring them and this ship tfarcugh
safe and sound

a moment later he descended
the stairs and led his men aft

 teutoberg displayed a flash of
generalship for his first ten men
who came in through the air-lock

 were pistol experts they rayed the
 marines in their tracks and cleared
 the passage leading to the lock be-
 fore the defenders could get organ-
 ized a few minutes later the in-
 vaders were spreading through the
 ship hunting down and ruthlessly
 slaying the marines whom they out-
 numbered three to one scattered
 fights to the death took place on all
 the decks winford snugly en-
 sconced in his air tunnel raged in-
 wardly as the crackling of the rays
 and the agonized screams of the
 wounded and dying came to his ears

   the fighting seemed to be draw-
 ing nearer he risked peeping out
 the young commander and half a
 dozen of his men covering them-
 selves as best they might with the
 inadequate protector shields of the
 service retreated to the foot of the
 stairs leading up to the control room
 as the invaders prepared to mow
 them down a sudden hush fell on the
 men and the invaders parted a huge
 man stepped out before them win-
 ford sucked in his breath sharply as
 he recognized teutoberg and saw
 him take a step forward in the direc-
 tion of the marines

   teutoberg raised his hand toward
 commander -a and spoke

	will you surrender or must my
 men obliterate you i would say that
 you pirates have your backs to the
 wall surely life is sweet why not
 surrender while you still have it

   were not pirates declared the
 young commander hotly

   teutoberg sneered

   it will take more than a gold and
 gray uniform of the interplanetary
 council military forces to convince
 me he retorted uniforms of any
 kind can be obtained anywhere in the
 universe where there happens to be
 a competent tailor

   the only pirates excepting your-
 selves aboard this ship are under
 lock and key said the commander
 thats where you will be before
 this matter is settled
astounding stories

fteutoberg laughed his man-
x ner changed suddenly

  what a line of talk for a pirate
he commented affably come
youngster there is no need to sacri-
fice lives uselessly surrender since
youre outnumbered anyway and
lets discuss this thing on a sane
basis

 commander g-a hesitated
winford could scarcely refrain from
shouting treachery then the ma-
rines lowered their shields and rays
next instant they went down under
the charge of the invaders

 the young commander was chalky
white when they dragged him bound
and helpless to his feet a trickle
of blood made a crimson line from
the corner of his mouth and his eyes
sparkled with helpless rage

 you dirty snake he gasped
youll sniff gas for this

  teutoberg laughed scornfully

  take them back to the air-lock
and shove them out naked one at a
time he ordered curtly thats the
way they would have treated us
save the young bantam for the last
now where is this evan winford
i have an old score to settle with
him

 up in his air tunnel winford
nodded grimly to himself teuto-
bergs words only added to the proof
that he knew all along that the
golden fleece was in the hands of
the interplanetary marines for his
request for winford revealed that
he had been following the helio re-
ports of the capture of the ship by
the marines and the stories being
broadcast throughout the universe
of how winford and jarl and their
pirate companions were being taken
with the ship to mars for piracy and
execution

 neither commander -a nor
his men deigned to answer teuto-
berg but one of his own men had al-
ready discovered that winford was
locked in his own stateroom and he
promptly indicated the door

  teutoberg scowled drew a pistol
in either hand and strode to the
door one of the men unlocked it
and he kicked it open he waited ex-
pectantly then advanced cautiously
into the room the sound of his baf-
fled curses filled the passage win-
ford grinned mirthlessly

  someone dies for this shouted
teutoberg storming out into the
passage where is he i say bring
me that martian jarl hell know
if anyone does bring him i say
and ill torture the truth out of his
big carcass

infords grin vanished
his eyes grew anxious as he
waited tense and breathless until
jarl with his big hands lashed to-
gether behind his back was brought
up from the hold

  so we meet again jarl jeered
teutoberg scowling blackly at him
where is this master of yours this
winford

  jarls eyes met teutobergs impas-
sively all too well he knew the in-
nate cruelty of this earthman some
explanation vould have to be made
to satisfy him never a flicker of an
feye-lash revealed what that expla-
nation would be but jarl glanced
stoically at the empty stateroom
he did it he said calmly

  did what you clod teutoberg
flung at him savagely

  ended his life as he swore he
would

  suicide impossible where is
the body

  he destroyed it together with his
life by drinking disintegrator con-
centrate he carried a capsule of it
when we escaped from mercury and
ive hard him swear time and again
that he would die before he would
permit himself to be taken back
teutoberg swallowed the story
there was nothing else to do ap-
parently he raved and cursed once
he raised his pistol to jarls heart
and lowered it again
the space rover



     youll take his place martian
   dog he snarled by proxy i shall
   treat him as he deserves and you
   shall be the proxy back to the hold
   with you for the present

    with that teutoberg whirled
  about strode up the stairs and van-
  ished in the control room

    commander -a and his men
  were dragged aft to the air-lock
  leaving the passage near winford
  temporarily empty he broke out the
  grating and wormed his way out of
  the air tunnel dropping on the floor
  hands first he sprang to his feet
  and started grimly up the steps to
  the control room inside that room
  was teutoberg a bigger man than
  himself and armed yet winford
  barehanded cautiously opened the
  door and stepped inside

  teutoberg was standing at

   one side of the room gazing in
   rapt attention at the slaughter of the
   helpless marines one by one he
   watched them emerge from the air-
   lock bloated and white in their
   nakedness with their convulsed
   limbs already growing rigid in the
   icy cold of space out in the open
   space between the two ships they
   hung motionless a few minutes then
   swiftly dissolved and vanished un-
   der the ray of a small disintegrator
   gun on the liner

     teutoberg smiled crookedly

     the door clicked behind him teu-
   toberg turned with a startled oath
   winford foul with grime and his
   clothing torn to rags stood there
   teutobergs eyes widened both
    hands leaped downward for the hol-
   stered pistols in his belt at that in-
   stant winford lunged for him

    one of teutobergs hands was
  now gripping a pistol winford
  struck frenziedly knocking it from
  teutobergs grasp the weapon slid
  under the chart table out of reach
  winford clutched teutobergs left
  hand which held the still holstered
  pistol

suddenly he saw  an advan-
tage and his heart leaped in ex-
ultation round behind teutoberg
he pivoted-a wrestling trick he had
learned as a boy for an instant they
stood back to back then with a
mighty effort winford heaved up-
ward relentlessly on his opponents
forearm

  teutoberg screamed in pain as
something snapped in his wrist the
pistol dropped from his nerveless
fingers winford flicked it out of
reach under the table with his toe
but had no chance to reach for it
because teutoberg had managed to
work himself free

  with a bellow of animal rage and
with arms flailing like wind-mills he
charged at winford again win-
ford met his rush with a rapid series
of blows and teutoberg went down
but up he came a wild light in his
eyes again he went down only to
struggle gamely to his feet once
more

  winford was gasping for breath
it amazed him that teutoberg could
endure so much punishment his
arm must be broken and he was ter-
ribly battered yet here he came stag-
gering back for more winford now
hunched down and like a crouching
animal advanced slowly toward his
enemy suddenly he started a right
almost from the deck straight for
teutobergs chin it connected teu-
toberg was lifted clear of the deck
and hurled unconscious against the
side of the control room six feet
away

  winford staggered to the commu-
nication board and his trembling fin-
gers clutched the air-lock phone

  hello hello he gasped teuto-
berg speaking send no more marines
out through the lock just now   
yes of course this is teutoberg

  he hung the instrument back on
its hook and clung dizzily to the
edge of the table at least the
slaughter was halted for the time
being


astounding stories

me would have to act fast he
caught up the big water pitch-
er from the holder on the wall where
it had miraculously escaped the
fight gulped deeply from it and
splattered water down his face and
chest then he picked up the two
pistols from the deck placed one in
his belt and gripped the other firmly
as he approached the unconscious
teutoberg

  at the first splash of water in his
face teutoberg groaned and rolled
over

  get up you winford ordered
harshly

  teutoberg sat up groggily the
sight of the pistol and winfords
eyes brought him out with a sudden
shock

  get over to that air-lock phone
and say just what i tell you to or-
dered winford grimly one false
word and ill ray you plenty

  teutoberg staggered to his feet
obediently and took the phone for
he had read death in winfords hard
eyes

  hello jarvis he asked his
body rigid under the prod of win-
fords pistol this is teutoberg
   yes i talked a minute ago ive
changed my plans jarvis weve got
to get the iridium out of the hold
and into the liner as soon as possible
or well be sighted by some other
craft take all the men but ten and
go back to the liner make ready
there for the cargo    youll have
to clear some cabins there is more
than i thought there isnt much
food aboard here anyway and it is
better to let the men go to mess right
away and start transferring the car-
go immediately afterward

  teutoberg hung up the phone

  is that satisfactory he asked
sullenly

  it will do was winfords terse
reply now when the men have
gone back to the liner order two of
the remainder to bring up jarl from
the hold to the control room here

jarl was as impassive as usual
when he entered the control room
and beheld winford in charge there
although his two captors stared in
amazement at teutoberg bloody and
battered seated against the side of
the room with his hands upraised
jarl calmly disarmed his two cap-
tors and closed the door

  only eight of teutobergs men
besides these remain on the golden
fleece winford explained to jarl
take care of them first then release
the rest of our men from the hold
tell agar to take charge of the ma-
chinery as soon as possible and have
the gunners stand by for further
orders

   awah replied jarl stoically and
left the control room

  he took care of the eight invaders
in his very efficient martian fashion
for he pistoled them with neatness
and dispatch where they stood be-
fore the air-lock with the young
commander and his remaining two
marines waiting to thrust them out
into space winford had not in-
structed jarl just how to take care
of the situation and the martian at-
tended to it in his own way com-
mander -a with his arms bound
behind his back stared in amazement
as jarl calmly stepped over the dead
bodies and went on his way to release
his fellow pirates from the hold

  up in the control room the radio
loud-speaker hummed to life

  teutoberg teutoberg are you
there cried an anxious voice
three interplanetary battle spheres
are approaching from the direction
of the earth they are still two
thousand miles away but they artf
coming on fast were going to cut
loose and run for it if youre not
back here in five minutes youll have
to stay where you are

  winford cut in then for teuto-
berg who gulped painfully before
speaking

  go right ahead he said in a
strained voice im staying here on
the space rover



  the golden fleece ill-ili see you
  later

    why didnt you say youd meet
  them in the hereafter suggested
  winford coldly as he cut out the
  microphone thats where you are
  going as soon as jarl returns hell
  be glad to help you on your way for

	he hasnt forgotten the aid you gave
  his brother-in-law in robbing him
  and sending him to mercury

    teutoberg made no answer

    things were happening swiftly
  already the liner was lurching for-
  ward frantically with every propul-
  sion ray flaming as she started her
  flight through space away from the
  avenging battle spheres red lights
  twinkled on the control board of the
  golden fleece agar at the gener-
  ators now threw in the power the
  big freighter leaped ahead like a gray-
  hound soon reaching a speed that
  even the swift battle spheres could
  not equal thanks to the engineering
  genius of the half-insane agar

    winford glanced around teuto-
  berg was already gone jarl had
  taken him down to the air-lock win-
  ford tried to forget him there were
  other things to think of there were
  the details of taking the golden
  fleece out to pluto near the fron-
  tiers of the suns domain-pluto
  that stronghold of the space pirates
  where a man could sell an entire
  planet or any part of it no questions
  asked if he could produce it for the
  buccaneer kings to bid on the
  freighter and its cargo were as good
  as sold already and the money they
  would bring would be more than
  enough to buy pardons and freedom
  for everyone in the crew

x	

 there were many details to
 consider carefully but instead
 winford found himself thinking of
 teutoberg down by the air-lock
 stripped of his clothing ready for
 his last adventure with life as much
 as winford hated the man he was
 forced into an unwilling admiration

for his dogged fight in the control
room a mere word in that telephone
would save him winford shook his
head irritably the man deserved
death yet again he saw the set fea-
tures the final walk into the air-lock
suddenly winford found himself at
the phone and heard himself giving
the order that would save teuto-
bergs life he sat down again sur-
prised at his own weakness he was
still musing when jarl entered

  you couldnt go-through with it
observed the big martian impassive-
ly i was afraid you couldnt it is
as i have always said of you earth-
lings you think you want revenge
good old ancient vengeance but
when the moment comes and you sit
in the high place and can have it you
weaken well you wont have to
execute teutoberg now

  what do you mean exclaimed
winford

  after i received your order and
told teutoberg he wasnt to go out
through the lock after all he
grinned it was an insult that grin
just as though he knew all along you
wouldnt have the nerve to kill him
and while i stood there asking my-
self if i should not go ahead and
shove him out anyway one of his
men-one of the two we captured up
here in this room-caught sight of
that grin he screamed something
about treachery and teutoberg be-
traying him to the pirates and be-
fore i could interfere he drew a
knife and stabbed teutoberg to
death right there before all of us
after that there was nothing to do
but to heave his body into the air-
lock and let it go on out into space

  far back across the void in a tiny
space sphere which winford had
given him and his two marines to re-
turn to the distant battle sphere
lieutenant commander -a saw
through his telescope the white
speck of teutobergs body leave the
side of the golden fleece and won-
dered what it was

conclusion

 what has gone before

lee bentley and ellen
estabrook have just returned
to america after
their horrible ad-

venture in the
african jungle
they still remem-
ber with dread

lee and ellen brave the horrors of
barter own laboratory in a rash
attempt to crush the omnipotent
scientist

and loathing how caleb barter a
mad scientist with his marvelous
surgery had removed the brain of
lee bentley and placed it in the
body of a giant
anthropoid ape
for many days
bentley had
roamed the jun-
gle as manape


until finally barter restored his
brain to his own body there was an
uprising among barters ape-herd
and lee and ellen had escaped be-
lieving the mad genius the victim of
the beasts

  now on their return to new york
they read of the machinations of one
who signs himself the mind master
and who threatens first to kill a well-
known financial figure and thereafter



steal the brains of twenty prominent
men whose names he mentions bent-
ley shudderingly recalls caleb
barter the brain wizard

  as they ride in their taxicab the
naked figure of a man staggers out of
the flatiron building he is scream-
ing madly and is bleeding from a
number of wounds which might have
been made by the fingernails of a
giant the man dies but not before
   	astounding stories

they hear him murmur something in-
coherent about the mind master

  bentley confers with thomas
tyler a famous detective and shows
him a tuft of hair he had taken from
the hand of the dead man there is a
telephone call from caleb barter
while they are at tylers office and
he boasts of being the mind master
and threatens lee and ellen

  barter in his fantastically equipped
and secret laboratory in the heart of
new york city is able to control his
living puppets by remote control he
now sends lecky a human being
with the brain of an ape to kidnap
harold hervey a great financier the
abduction is cleverly executed and
later the body of hervey its skull-
pan missing is delivered to his home

  tyler and bentley prepare to
thwart barters attempt to abduct
one saret balisle from his sixteenth-
story office the following morning
they make thorough preparations
and the corridor and the street be-
low are filled with police unexpect-
edly under their very noses a giant
ape captures balisle climbs out on
the window-sill and begins a slow
descent of the side of the building
as the police wait breathlessly un-
able to interfere a limousine shoots
up on the sidewalk and the ape only
two stories above the street throws
balisle through the roof of the car
which makes a hurried getaway

  bentley and the police trap the
ape in the building and wound it
mortally before it dies they learn
hat it houses the brain of hervey

  knowing that barter will need an-
other ape bentley determines to be
that ape

chapter viii

the mute plungers

it would be difficult to compre-
hend the nervous strain under
which manhattan had been
laboring during the past thirty-
six hours the story of the kidnap-

ing of harold hervey had not been
given to the newspapers for an ex-
cellent reason if herveys financial
enemies knew of his kidnaping and
death they would hammer away at
his stocks until they fell to nothing
and his family accustomed to fabu-
lous wealth would have been re-
duced to beggary

  the mind master himself up to a
late hour had given no word to the
newspapers in his manifestoes
the hervey family held its breath
fearing that he would-for the news-
papers would have played the story
for all the sensationalism it would
capy bentley when this matter was
called to his attention wondered
barter had kept his own counsel for
a purpose but what was it there
was no way of asking him

 the story of the mad race down
broadway in pursuit of the limousine
which had returned the lifeless body
of hervey to his residence had been a
sensational one and the tabloids had
given it their best treatment the
chauffeur who had crawled out like
a monkey atop his careening car to
lose his life when catapulted into the
entrance to the twenty-third street
subway station the three policemen
whose lives had been lost because the
chauffeur hadnt stopped as they had
expected him to the kidnaping of
saret balisle by a great ape hadnt
yet broken as a story nor the murder
of balisles chauffeur

  but everybody knew something of
the story of the naked man of the
day before many were the specula-
tions as to what had ripped and torn
his flesh from his body along with
his clothes what manner of claws
had it been which had sliced him in
scores of places as though with many
razors

  men and women walked the streets
apprehensively and many of them
turned at intervals to look behind
them no telling what they would do
when the story of balisles kidnap-
ing by an anthropoid ape and a queer
the mind master



mute chauffeur got abroad to top it
all the police pursuers lost the
balisle limousine and saret balisle
had taken his place among the lost

bentley knew as soon as the
disgruntled and rather fright-
ened police officers returned to the
clinton building with the news that
balisle had got away from them in
the stolen balisle car that already
the ill-fated young man was probably
under the anesthetic which caleb
barter used on his victims

  tyler do you know a surgeon
who can do any surgical job short of
brain transplantation

  yeah theres a chap has offices in
the fifth avenue building hes
probably the very best in the racket
maybe its because of his name its
tyler

  some relative of yours

  not much hes just my dad-and
one of the worlds finest and clever-
est

  will he listen to reason can he
perform delicate operations

  hes my dad bentley and hed
do almost anything i asked him so
long as it was honest    and he
could switch the noses of a mosquito
and a humming bird so skillfully
that the humming bird would go
looking for a sleeping cop anthe
mosquito would start building a nest
in a tree

  get him here no-has he an oper-
ating room where all sound can be
shut out ive got a hunch id like
somehow to try and drop a screen
around us as we work maybe your
dad would know what to do you see
im positive that barter sees every-
thing we do and if he sees me turn-
ing into an ape he would just chuckle
and pass up the trap

  hes got a lead armored room
where he keeps a bit of radium
thats it talk to him no not on
the phone youll have to figure out
some way to do it so that you can be
sure barter isnt listening

  ill manage ill send him a note
your messenger will be killed on
the way to him

  then ill go myself

  and barter will watch everybody
that goes into his office or comes out
and mark down each person as pos-
sibly being connected with the
police however you figure it out

hen tyler had gone and the
dead ape had been stretched
out in one corner of balisles office
and covered with something to cloak
its hideousness bentley telephoned
ellen estabrook

  have i been making any appoint-
ments with you this morning he
asked her cheerily

  please dont jest when things are
so terrible have you seen the latest
papers

  no what do they say

  theres a lot of the story im
thinking about youd better read it
right away its an extra anyhow
the newsies ought to be calling it
around you somewhere-and where
are you anyway

  bentley informed her and told
her too that he would be with her
as soon as he possibly could taking
the usual masculine advantage he de-
cided to tell her now what he
wouldnt have had the heart to tell
her to her face that he was planning
a rather desperate stunt to reach bar-
ter and would consequently be away
from her for an indefinite period

  but ill see you first she said
after a long hesitation bentley could
hear her voice tremble though he
knew she was fighting desperately to
keep him from noting the catch in
her voice

  yes nothing will happen until-
well not until ive seen you again
just as bentley hung up the re-
ceiver the extra was being cried
some two hours had now elapsed
since balisle had been taken away
and now the newsboys were shouting
the headlines


astounding stories

  extra extra all about the big
wall street crash hervey fortune
entirely swept away

bentley sent an office boy out
for the paper and spread it out
on the desk to digest it as quickly as
possible

  one million shares of hervey in-
corporated read the blacjwords in
a box on the first page-a story in
mourning were dumped on the mar-
ket at eleven oclock this morning
four men seem to have been behind
the queer coup one of them had a
power of attorney from harold her-
vey himself and he had the shares to
sell so many shares were dumped
that the bottom fell out of the stock
others holding the hervey shares
fearful that they would get nothing
at all also began to dump and every
share thus dumped was bought up
quickly by three other men about
whom nobody knew anything except
that they paid with cash the
strangest thing about it all was that
the three men who bought hervey
incorporated seemed to be dumb-
mutes for they didnt say anything
they acted through a broker and
indicated their purchases with their
fingers in the conventional manner
and tendered cards as identification
they were harry stanley clarence
morton and willard cleve-ad-
dresses unknown history unknown

  nothing in fact is known about
any of the three or the little white-
haired apple-cheeked man who sold
so heavily in hervey incorporated
that the three mutes did not buy the
shares sold by the little white-haired
man would seem to indicate that all
four of them worked together  but
it is only a supposition as they were
not seen together and apparently did
not know one another but the three
mutes constantly ate walnuts all
four men who among them knocked
the bottom out of wall street and
wiped away the hervey fortune
slipped out in the excitement in-

  spired by their rapid buying and sell-
ing and seemed to vanish into thin
air

  bentley didnt know much about
the stock market but it seemed to
him that barter had managed a theft
of mighty proportions with a power
of attorney which he had wrung
from hervey after his capture he
had managed to possess himself of
herveys shares in themselves they
were worth millions even at a frac-
tion of their price barter would real-
ize heavily on them selling quickly
he would force the price far down
then his puppets-and bentley had
no doubt that stanley morton and
cleve were his puppets-bought all
other shares offered by panicky in-
vestors in hervey incorporated at a
tiny fraction of their value far less
naturally than barter had made by
selling his loot

  the purchased shares barter could
hold for an increase hervey incor-
porated was good and its price would
go up again and barter would sell
and gain millions

that is how bentley saw it and
his lips drew into a firmer
straighter line as half an hour later
he explained it all to ellen

  its desperate dear he whis-
pered in her ear manhattans finan-
cial structure has been shaken to its
foundations but that isnt all by any
means barter has performed his hor-
rible operation on two of new yorks
most brilliant men it was a barter
gesture to send harold hervey to
capture balisle and the horror of it
staggered me

  lee said ellen understand
this that if i have no word from you
within seventy-two no forty-eight
hours after you get started on this
scheme you have in mind im going
to get through to barter somehow if

i	put an ad in the paper and tell him
where im to be found hell surely
make another attempt to take me in
if hes captured you or uncovered
the mind master



the trap youre laying then ill at
least be with you if he kills you he
kills me if we cant live together we
can die together

  bentley kissed her fervently try-
ing not to think what it would mean
to him now if she were in the hands
of caleb barter secretly he intended
having tyler keep her so closely
guarded that she couldnt possibly do
anything as foolish as she had sug-
gested

  the late evening papers carried
another manifesto of the mind mas-
ter to the effect that the remaining
eighteen men named on the original
list were to be taken before noon of
the next day

  oddly enough eighteen kidnapings
were reported from various places in
manhattan brooklyn and queens

  so thought bentley hes afraid
to send out normal apes to capture
his eighteen key men maybe his con-
trol over them is not perfect thats
it i suppose-he needs human brains
before he can exercise perfect con-
trol i suppose stanley morton and
cleve did the kidnapings

late that night bentley kissed
ellen good-by told her to keep
up her courage and repaired to the
rendezvous arranged for by thomas
tyler and his surgeon father in the
operating room was the cold boajr of
the anthropoid that had successfully
abducted saret balisle

  young man said dr tyler just
what is it you want me to do im not
asking for your reasons tommy tells
me you know what youre doing i
must say though i dont believe that
story of brain transplantation no
doctor would believe it for a minute
bentley looked at the dead ape
youll take tommys word for it
that that ape kidnaped saret balisle
to-day and took him down the face of
a building sixteen stories to the
ground

 of course tommy wouldnt
string his father

  well part of your surgical work
to-night will make it necessary for
you to look at that creatures brain
youll recognize a human brain in
that apes skull after youve made
that discovery heres what i want
you to do ill strip to the skin then
i want you to place the skin of that
ape on me so that from top to toes i
am an ape youll have to do the job
so perfectly that ill be an ape-as
soon as under your watchful eye
and toms i have mastered all the
ape mannerisms the three of us can
remember can you do it

  tyler senior shrugged

  he motioned his son and bentley
to help him lift the huge ape body to
the operating table and under the
glaring light above he set to work
with instruments which gleamed like
molten silver then became a sullen
red   

chapter ix

the furry mime

isten boys said dr tyler
after he had removed the skin
of the ape and for a few brief sec-
onds had examined the brain to
shake his head in astonishment ive
an idea that may help you it would
te impossible for you bentley to
play the ape well enough to fool this
mad mind master but a hitherto un-
known type of ape has just been dis-
covered in colombia i read the story
of it in a scientific journal to-day
the ape is more manlike than any
other known to science you shall be
that ape brought in during the nht
by a famous returned explorer there
will be great interest in you now that
the story of saret balisles kidnaping
has broken with the attention of
new york upon you certainly your
presence will interest caleb barter
tyler senior rummaged in a pile of
papers on his desk and brought forth
the story he referred to which also
carried a picture of the colombian
ape


astounding stories

  it would be impossible for me to
change your shape and add to your
size sufficiently to make you a real
giant anthropoid youd have to be
twice as deep through the chest
youd have to have bowed legs as big
as small tree trunks youd have to
have a sloping forehead no its im-
possible for id have to equip you by
padding to an impossible degree and
a scientist would only need touch
you to know you as an imitation ape
but if you are made up as the colom-
bian ape-

  bentley quickly interrupted

  the idea is excellent i was dubi-
ous before about my chances of suc-
cess but as an ape of a new species i
have a far better chance and my in-
evitable human behavior wont be so
noticeable

                                

dr tyler measured bentley as
carefully as a tailor proud of
his skill measures a particular
wealthy customer

  you will almost suffocate he
said keeping up a running monolog
as his inspired hands worked with
forceps and scalpels but i can make
plenty of air vents in the ape skin
which will allow the pores of your
skin to breathe if they are hidden
under the hair they will scarcely be
noticed unless of course barter sees
what we are doing here and suspects
from the beginning

  i can stand the discomfort for as
long as may prove necessary said
bentley grimly conquering a feeling
of terror as he already saw himself
in the role of an ape a role previous-
ly played in which he had suffered
the torments of the damned and
anything is preferable to the whole-
sale carnage which barter is doing
in seventy-two hours he has wrecked
the morale of manhattan i shall try
to get it back tyler will you make
every effort to guard the other eight-
een men named on the mind mas-
ters original list

 of course but tyler said it

dubiously barter had proved it al-
most impossible to outwit him in
their hearts both bentley and tyler
knew that barter would make good
his boast to take the eighteen men he
had named it seemed a grim price
manhattan must pay to be finally rid
of barters satanic machinations

 when bentley stripped naked
quietly announced his readiness to
take his place on the operating table
tyler senior took a deep breath like
a diver preparing to plunge into icy
water and looked questioningly at
bentley

 im ready sir said bentley
quietly lets get on with the task

  dr tyler set to work with amaz-
ing uncanny speed he had never
been more skilful in closing sutures
of the flesh in any of his myriad of
operations he was a man inspired as
he labored on the task of changing
lee bentley from a normal human
being to a colombian ape

hile the surgeon worked his
son telephoned to the co-
lombian explorer whose return from
latin-america had been mentioned
in the days news he couldnt ex-
plain anything over the telephone he
said but would doctor jackson come
at once to the private offices of james
tyler surgeon

  doctor jackson grumbled but the
urgency in the voice of tyler con-
vinced him that the thing was impor-
tant he promised to be on hand
within an hour it then lacked a few
minutes of three oclock in the morn-
ing

  next at bentleys suggestion-and
he talked quickly and eagerly to keep
his mind off the ordeal he knew he
was facing-tyler got the curator of
the bronx zoo out of bed and asked
him to wait upon doctor tyler im-
mediately

 at four oclock doctor jackson
and the curator entered the room
where surgeon tyler had performed
a miracle
the mind master

 doctor jackson stepped back in
amazement when he noted the man-
like ape which leaned with arms
folded against one wall of the oper-
ating room his eyes were big with
amazement

 he studied bentley for several
minutes while no one spoke a word

  it was the curator who broke the
strained silence

  so this is your colombian ape
he said i read the news story but i
understood that the ape you had
found had been killed in the attempt
to capture it

  surgeon tyler spoke easily

  that news story he said was
to prevent doctor jackson from
being annoyed by visitors eager to
see his find as a matter of sober fact
doctor jackson captured the colom-
bian ape alive and is now about to
turn it over to the zoo understand
me doctor jackson

still the explorer said nothing
for a moment longer he stared
at bentley then he walked over to
him

  the hair is different he said as
though talking to himself the co-
lombian apes hair is of a slightly
finer texture but that could be ex-
plained away as i allowed only the
merest bit of information to the re-
porters to-day i can add a supple-
mentary story in the next newspaper
which will explain that the coarse
fur of the colombian ape is the only
thing about it which makes it resem-
ble a giant anthropoid

 jackson had walked to bentley
without fear and ran his fingers
through the hair as he spoke

  i know its a man and some sur-
geon has performed a miracle he
said just what is it you wish me to
do

  youve read the stories relating to
the mind master doctor asked
bentley suddenly how strangely his
voice came from the body of an ape

 ive read some of them an-

swered jackson is this a scheme
whereby you hope to trap the mind
master

  yes

  then depend upon me for any
assistance i can render as a scientist
i understand fully the power for evil
of a mad genius of our class this
mind master should be ruthlessly de-
stroyed

  thank you said bentley step-
ping forward you know perhaps
how the colombian ape behaves
enough that you can coach me how
to walk how to gesture

   certainly it will take perhaps an
hour to prepare you to fill your role
creditably

                                                     

jacksons face flushed with en-
thusiasm he was launched on a
task which fired his interest he was
an authority on apes and anything
relating to them inspired him

  seat yourself on a chair said
jackson the colombian ape sits
upright like a man

  bentley seated himself as jackson
had bidden him

  now spread your legs apart awk-
wardly with the knees straight the
colombian ape doesnt exactly sit on
a chair or a rock or a tree he leans
against it in a half sitting position
bentley quickly assumed the awk-
ward strained position suggested by
jackson

  jackson stepped up to him and
placed bentleys arms unbent so
that his fists hung down outside his
wide-apart knees and cupped his
fingers so that they seemed perpetu-
ally in the act of closing on some-
thing

   you cant possibly take the proper
position with your toes went on
jackson for its beyond a mans
ability to curve his toes as he does
his hands the colombian apes toes
are prehensile

  cant you say in your next news
story doctorsuggested bentley
that the colombian ape the nearest
astounding stories

animal relative of man seems to be
in an advanced stage of evolution
can you not say that the colombian
ape is by way of losing the use of his
toes	

  many scientists know that to be
untrue said jackson but perhaps
we can help you through your
scheme before they begin denying
details in the newspapers too bad
we cant send secret suggestions to
all anthropologists that they remain
discreetly silent until the mantle of
horror is lifted from manhattan but
of course we cant sinc wed betray
ourselves our only hope then is to
work at top speed

  i am as eager as anyone to finish
a particularly horrible task said
bentley

under jacksons instructions
bentley walked up and down
the room his shaggy shadow on the
several walls as he turned marched
and countermarched at jacksons
commands filled bentley with self-
loathing he found himself repulsive
his body perspired freely impreg-
nating the ape skin with a harsh odor
that was biting and terrible in his
nostrils it was sickening he tried
to close his mind to the repulsive-
ness of what he was doing

  he walked with a swaying side-
to-side gait something like a sailors
rolling walk while his arms swung
free at his sides as though they mere-
ly hung from his body the colom-
bian ape walked like that jackson
said

  how about the intelligence of the
colombian ape asked eentley

  we shot the only specimen so far
seen by man before we could discover
any facts bearing on his intelli-
gence said jackson

  then you can safely say that he
possesses intelligence far beyond
that of known apes said bentley
quickly somewhere let us say be-
tween that of the lowest order of
mankind and civilized man

 jackson nodded his head dubi-
ously

  it seems he said unsmilingly
that i arrived in the united states
at exactly the right time you would
have failed signally to convince the
mind master in the role of an afri-
can great ape

 bentley managed a short laugh
how horribly it came from the lips
of an ape

  im not overly superstitious he
said but i regard this as a good
omen i feel were sure to succeed in
what we are planning i think barter
will surely wish to experiment with
me if he thinks i am in reality a great
ape from colombia hell welcome
the chance to examine any ape which
so nearly resembles man im an im-
portant link in his plan to create a
race of supermen at least thats how
we must hope that barter will esti-
mate the situation when my story is
told in to-morrows papers

an hour before dawn doctor
jackson weary from his ardu-
ous instruction of the equally ex-
hausted bentley pronounced lee a
satisfactory ape

  now heres where you come in
said bentley tiredly to the curator
im to be taken now to a cage in the
bronx during the rest of to-day you
will quietly instruct your attend-
ants that their guard to-night at the
zoo must not be too strict i must be
in position to be stolen by the min-
ions of the mind master

  now the full significance of the
desperate expedition upon which
bentley was embarking came home
to them all their faces were white
bentley shuddered under his ape
robe his mind went catapulting back
into the past to the time when he had
been manape this was much like it
save that all of him was now encased
in the accouterments of an ape and
he did not suffer the mental hazards
which had almost driven him insane
when he had been manape with the
the mind master	

perpetual necessity of keeping close
watch over his own human body
which had held the brain of an ape

  he stiffened im ready he said

  immediately upon arrival the
curator had been asked to have a
closed car quickly walled with a
mixture of lead and zinc-which
bentley and tyler hoped would
thwart the spying of caleb barter-
brought to tylers door

  three or four zoo attendants en-
tered with a cage when bentley
pronounced himself ready they
stared agape at bentley and their
faces went white when he strode
toward them upright like a man

  bentley would have spoken to re-
assure them but tyler signaled him
to keep silent the zoo attendants
might talk and entirely spoil their
scheme

two hours later long before the
first crowds began to arrive at
the bronx zoo lee bentley was
driven from his small cage in the car
into a huge cage at the zoo from a
dark corner in which he crouched
as though overcome with fear he
gazed affrightedly out across what
he could see of bronx park

  when i used to feed the animals
here he said to himself i never
expected that the time would come
when i myself would be caged-and
one of them

  the curator had ridden out with
the cage but save for making sure
of the fastening on the big cage he
paid no heed to bentley he treated
him of necessity as though he were
actually the colombian ape he pre-
tended to be from now on until he
succeeded or failed lee bentley was
an ape from the jungles of latin-
america

  just before the crowds could rea-
sonably be expected to begin arriv-
ing curious to see this strange thing
doctor jackson had brought from
colombia an attendant arrived with
a freshly painted sign

  colombian great ape it read
presented to bronx zoo by doctor
claude jackson

  it seemed to close entirely behind
lee bentley the vast door which sep-
arated the apes from civilization
miserably he crouched in his corner
and awaited the coming of the
curious

chapter x
grim anticipation

a numbing fear began to grow
upon lee bentley as the ordeal
of waiting began

  naturally he could not eat the food
given usually to apes and of course
he could not be seen calmly eating
bacon and eggs with knife and fork-
and because he couldnt eat he was
assailed by a dreadful hunger which
however he managed to fight down
partially he smiled inwardly as he
looked ahead and understood that
despite the warnings not to feed the
animals children of all ages from
four years to sixty would surrepti-
tiously toss peanuts and walnuts into
his cage

he felt a little hopeful about it
they would at least allay his hunger

  but no he could not do that
either nobody had thought to ask
doctor jackson how a colombian
ape manipulated his food even a
certain clumsiness in that respect
might start questions which would
cause the public to doubt the authen-
ticity of jacksons find

  bentley deckled to sulk the ape
he was supposed to be could reason-
ably he expected to resent captivity
and would probably go on a hunger
strike he would do likewise and be
in character if he starved

  he crouched in a far corner as the
first comers begar to arrive they
were fathers and mothers with their
children and-the older people car-
ried usually newspapers under their
arms bentley wished with all his
soul that he could see one of the


astounding stories

papers close enough to read the head-
lines

  however when the crowd was not
too thick bentley waddled nearer to
the wire mesh which separated hkn
from the curious crowd and through
lids which were half closed as
though he slept he managed to
glimpse a few excerpts from the
paper

 police department redoubling
their precautions to prevent mind
master from capturing eighteen in-
tended victims

  hideout of mind master still un-
discovered when will the public be
delivered from the stupidity of the
police

  doctor jackson returns from co-
lombia bringing a living specimen of
an ape hitherto unknown to civilized
man but more like him than any ape
hitherto known visitors may see the
creature to-day in the bronx zoo

that was the story which had
brought out the visitors who
were forming moment by moment a
bigger crowd before bentleys cage
bentley managed a glimpse of a
womans wrist-watch after what
seemed an age of trying to do so
without his intention becoming plain
to the too bright children who
crowded as close to the cage as at-
tendants would permit it was ten
oclock it would be at least twelve
more hours before bentley could
reasonably expect any action on the
part of barter barter would now be
concentrating on his plans to kidnap
the eighteen men he had first named

  bentley tried to make the time pass
faster by imagining what barter
would be doing by now his labors
must be titanic he must have sep-
arate controls for each of his min-
ions and there were many times
when he must control several at one
time thus making his task akin to
that of a man trying to look two
ways at once while he rolled a ciga-
rette with one hand and shined his

shoes with the other certainly the
concentration required was enor-
mous

  yet no matter how complicated
became his puzzle barter was its
master because he was its creator and
bentley hadnt the slightest doubt
that until someone actually pene-
trated barters stronghold he would
not be stopped

  bentley knew that at the very first
opportunity he would destroy caleb
barter as he would have destroyed a
mad dog or stamped to death a dead-
ly snake the life of one man would
rest lightly upon his conscience if
that man were caleb barter

  perhaps though he could learn
many of barters secrets before he
destroyed him properly used they
might prove boons to mankind it
was only the use barter was putting
them to that threatened to fill the
world with horror and bloodshed

am a why dont he eat
hush said a woman as
though afraid the colombian ape
would hear and become angry
dont annoy the creature he looks
fully capable of coming right out at
us

  but the child who had been admon-
ished began to juggle a bag of pea-
nuts which he managed to throw into
the cage bentley stooped forward
sniffing suspiciously at the sack
while a wave of hunger made him
feel weak and giddy for a moment
he just realized that he hadnt eaten
for almost twenty-four hours his
time had been so filled with action
and excitement that there hadnt
been opportunity

  i hope he said to himself in an
effort to drive away thoughts of
food that tyler will take every pre-
caution to prevent ellen from doing
something foolish

  knowing that he could no longer
communicate with her could no
longer be absolutely sure that she
was still out of barters clutches he
the mind master



suffered agonies of fear for her
safety

  if barter places a hand on her ill
tear his skin from his carcass bit by
bit he said unconsciously clench-
ing his fists

  oh look mama hes shuttin his
fists as though he wanted to fight
somebody ill bet he could whip
dempsey couldnt he mama

  perhaps he could son hush now
and watch him theres a good boy

  it brought bentley sharply back to
his surroundings and proved to him
that he must not allow his mind to go
wool-gathering if he did not wish to
give himself away what if in an ac-
cess of anger he happened to speak
his thoughts aloud he could imag-
ine the amazement of the crowd

he day wore on

 at noon a strange horror
seemed to travel over the bronx zoo
and within a short time every last
visitor had precipitately departed
bentley could now safely approach
the wire mesh and look out and
around over a wider radius

  right under the wire mesh was a
newspaper someone had thrown
away

  by pressing tightly against the
mesh bentley could see the head-
lines

  mind master successful on all
counts

  so thats what had turned the
crowd to stony silence with very
fear they had all fled wondering
who would be next bentley had
heard the shouting of the extra on
the distant streets but it had been so
far away he hadnt beard the words
one solitary newspaper had appeared
among the bronx crowd and the
story it carried under startling
scareheads had passed from brain to
brain as though by magic    and the
crowd had fled

  bentley stared down at the news-
paper in horror a horror that was in
no way mitigated by his having fully

expected barter to succeed mutual-
ly with no words having been spoken
to express the thought tyler and
bentley had conceded to barter the
eighteen victims he had named

  nothing could be done to stop him
his brains were greater than the
combined wisdom of the city of new
york

  what else was in that paper

  bentley stared at it for an hour
and finally a vagrant breeze for
which he bad hoped and prayed dur-
ing that hour whipped across the
park and stirred the paper he read
more headlines

  lee bentley disappears believed
kidnaped or slain by mind master

  how had that story got out sure-
ly tyler would have kept that from
the press following on the heels of
the colombian ape story barter
would almost surely put two and two
together to arrive at the proper total

entley read on

lee bentley disappears mysterious-
ly from her hotel room guarded by
a score of police not one has yet
been found who knows anything of
her disappearance or saw her leave
nobody seems to have seen anyone
go to her room or leave it our police
department must have fallen on evil
days indeed when twenty crack
plain-clothes men cannot keep one
woman under surveillance

  something was radically wrong
but bentley could not piece the
whole story together simply because
he had been out of touch for so many
hours that the thread of it had
slipped from his fingers

  suddenly bentley noticed that a
solitary man was watching him curi-
ously a dawning amazement in his
face bentley roused himself and
saw that he was standing against the
mesh fingers hooked into it above
his head his weight on his left leg
his right foot crossed over his left
his head thoughtfully bowed
	astounding stories

  to the amazed man yonder the
colombian ape must have looked
remarkably jike a condemned man
clutching the bars of his cell await-
ing the coming of the executioner

  bentley recovered himself and sat
down on the floor of the cage in the
loose easy manner an ape would have
used

  he forced himself to sit thus until
evening when the last curious one
vanished from the park and darkness
began to fall

  then excitement at the approach
of a hoped for denouement began to
rise in his heart like a rushing tide

  would barter fall for the ruse or
did he already know that the colom-
bian ape was lee bentley

  in either case bentley thought
the mind master would take action
during the first hours of darkness
bentley was gambling desperately
on what he knew to be characteristic
of caleb barter

chapter xi
in the dead of night

bentley knew that if ellen
were in the hands of caleb bar-
ter the mad professor would prob-
ably do her no harm but use her as a
club against bentley and through
bentley the manhattan police he
did not believe that the mind master
would consider performing the brain
operation on ellen caleb barters
scheme seemed to consider only men
and men of substance

  no ellen would not be harmed he
felt but that made him feel no easier
knowing that she might be in the
hands of barter

 how could he know of naka
machi and the refined vengeance of
the mind master

  the last visitors had left the park
and comparative quiet settled over
the zoo save for the sounds of ani-
mals feeding and the occasional curs-
ing voices of attendants there were
no sounds not since bentley had

taken his place in the cage had any-
one spoken to him he had never felt
so lonely and uncertain in his life

  now there was utter darkness and
silence

  and then before his cage appeared
a tiny spot of light if barters min-
ions expected to deal with a power-
ful ape they would come prepared to
subdue him by whatever means
seemed necessary bentley had no
wish to be injured and yet he must
make some show of resistance in or-
der to allay any possible suspicion
that he wished to be stolen

  there was a faint gnawing sound
at the wire outside the cage mice
might have made that sound sharp-
ening their teeth on the wire bent-
ley decided to feign sleep had bar-
ter come personally to supervise his
capture that didnt seem reason-
able as barter must realize that all
his effectiveness depended upon his
ability to retain control of whatever
organization he might have built up
-and his central control must be his
hideout

  then he would be sending some of
his puppets to get bentley

  would they be apes with mens
brains impossible apes could not
travel from place to place without
attracting attention especially if
they traveled unguarded and went
casually to a given destination as
men would go no if his puppets
were not men in the normal meaning
then they were apemen

the wire came softly down
bentley hoped that no attend-
ant might come blundering around
now to spoil everything his heart
pounded with excitement

  at last he was going to see caleb
barter again at close quarters

  i shall destroy him he told him-
self

  the shadowy outlines of two men
came through the severed wires
bentley still pretended to be asleep
he wondered if barters televisory
the mind master



equipment included any arrange-
ments permitting him to see in the
dark and knew instantly that it did
how else could these two puppets
have come so unerringly to the
proper cage in bronx park

  no bentley did not dare allow
himself to be taken easily in the hope
that his actions would pass un-
noticed

  but he waited until the ropes be-
gan to fall about him testing the
strength of his adversaries by mental
measurement by their uncertain
hesitating actions he knew that he
dealt only with the forms of men-
forms which were ruled by brains
which had not in themselves intelli-
gence enough to perform the acts
they were now performing ape
brains in the skull-pans of men the
brains in themselves were only im-
portant because they were living mat-
ter which was being used as a sensory
sounding board by which caleb bar-
ter the mind master transmitted his
commands to the arms and legs and
bodies of his puppets

  bentley sprang into action he
growled and snarled at the two men
who were trying to take him only
two men surely barter would have
sent more than two men to take a
great ape he knows im not a true
ape thought bentley hes giving me
a challenge he knows i wish to get
to his hideout and he is making sure
that i get there

  but bentley was only guessing
calmness descended upon him as he
realized that he was soon to face a
crucial test

just now however he struck out
at the two men who were btriving
to bind him they were husky chaps
and one of them packed the wallop
of a real fighter neither man said a
word to him and when his own hands
clawed at them-how would he dare
strike out with his fists-the men
made queer animal sounds in their
throats bentley could well remem-

ber how helpless hopeless and lost
he had felt when his brain had been
in the skull-pan of manape

  the brain of an ape could not be a
terribly intelligent instrument in the
first place what thoughts if apes
had thoughts at all coursed through
an ape brain which found itself in-
side a human skull

  the answer to that was simple
only such thoughts as barter orig-
inated and transmitted through the
mental sounding board after all the
material of the human brain and the
ape brain were perhaps very much
alike and barter was working on a
sound scientific principle in making
a sounding board of an apes brain

  bentley shuddered through the fur
that covered him knowing the sort
of creatures with which he had to
deal-men in all things save their in-
telligence-made him tremble with
nausea such grim ghastly hybrids
but he stopped shuddering when he
recalled that he still dealt with men
after all-at least with one man
caleb barter when he thought of
these two apemen as separate en-
tities of a human being of many per-
sonalities-caleb barter-he was
able to plan some method by which
to deal with them

  so now he fought seemingly with
the utmost savagery to keep them
from binding him with ropes even
as he fought however he fancied he
could hear the grim chuckling of
caleb barter what did barter know

  bentley knew that eventually he
would discover the truth

in struggling against the two
men his hands encountered the
knobs on their heads-the tiny metal
balls protruding from the top of the
skull at the point where in babies
the head remains soft during baby-
hood he could have broken connec-
tion with barter for these two by
jerking the controls ftfee and then
what he would never get through
to barter and would release in bronx
astounding stories

park two men whose strange type of
madness when they were discovered
would startle the countryside two
men with the savagery of anthropoid
apes he shuddered as he carefully
refrained from disturbing those balls

  at last bentley was quite securely
bound only his lower limbs remain-
ing free so that he could walk
though the length of his steps was
strictly limited his hands were en-
tirely and securely bound and the
significance of this fact did not
escape him barter knew that he did
not need his hands to aid him in
walking of course the newspaper
story released by doctor jackson had
reported the colombian ape as being
able to walk exactly like a man

  but that didnt prevent bentley
from nursing the suspicion that bar-
ter already knew even if he did it
could in no wise alter the determina-
tion of bentley his task was to
penetrate  the hideout of barter-
and he was on the way there now

ith little attempt at conceal-
ment the two men led bentley
to a long black closed car outside the
park they met no one the two men
avoided discovery with uncanny ease
bentley thrilled with excitement he
felt he knew approximately where
barters hideout was

  it was useless to speculate how-
ever time would show it to him

  bentley was tossed into the ton-
neau of the car his two captors
moving with the precision of men in
a trance took their places in the
front seat bentley struggled for a
time against his bonds he wanted to
sit up and peer out to see what way
they took so that he would know
where he was when he reached bar-
ters hideout but of course even if
he shook his bonds free he did not
dare rise to a sitting position for to
control the intricate handling of his
two puppets barters attention must
have been pretty carefully fixed upon
this car

  so bentley contented himself with
waiting

  lying on his back on the floor of
the car he tried to see what he could
through the car windows he knew
when he was carried under an ele-
vated system by the crashing roar of
trains over his head he knew he was
being carried downtown but he
wasnt sure that this was the sixth
avenue elevated

  how could he find out the road
they were traveling without sitting
up and looking at street signs

he felt he didnt dare do that
hed be as careful as possible
on the off-chance that barter really
believed him a colombian ape when
the benefit of surprise would be with
bentley

  the car progressed downtown at a
normal speed it stopped for red
lights and obeyed all other traffic
regulations barter was taking no
chance on losing more of his pup-
pets

  bentley suddenly gasped with hor-
ror as he remembered something
eighteen important men of manhat-
tan had been kidnaped that day by
caleb barter would bentley be
forced to watch the mad professor
perform the eighteen inevitable op-
erations

  perspiration poured from every
pore as he visualized the horror he
might be compelled to witness when
he was finally taken into barters
hideout the ape skin clung to him
as though it were actually his own
there were even moments when
bentley feared that it might grow to
him

  but he put the feeling of horror
from him with the thought that if
ellen were in barters power barter
might even be forcing her to anesthe-
tize for him while he performed his
grisly slaughter

  bentleys courage returned and
now it seemed to him that the jour-
ney would never end so eager was
the mind master

he to discover whether or not ellen
had eluded the hands of the mind
master

chapter xii
a woman of courage

caleb barter smiled warmly
at the woman who had come to
him almost as though in answer to a
prayer he admired her flashing eyes
and the lifted chin which spoke of
pride and courage

  i had thought of improving the
feminine strain of the race also he
told her but almost as though he
spoke to himself but i realized that
it mattered little the stature of the
mothers of the race so long as the
fathers were made virile but if all
women were like yourself miss
estabrook the race would not re-
quire the improvement it is now my
duty to bestow upon it

  ellen stared directly into the eyes
of the white-haired old man as she
looked at him she found it hard to
believe that one so gentle from out-
ward appearances had such a vast
grim power for evil in repose his
face was kindly though there was
something out of character in the
fact that it was so apple rosy and
his lips were far too red

  where she said quietly fearless-
ly is lee bentley

  barter raised his eyebrows as he
stared back at her so far she had not
looked around at this great room into
which he had had her conducted she
had seemed interested only in her
mission whatever that might be

you mean that delightfully rude
young man he asked sardonically

  you knoy well enough whom i
mean where is he

  then he is not to be found in his
usual haunts

  he has disappeared

  and you come out seeking pro-
fessor barter because bentley has
disappeared it is almost as though
you had previously arranged with

him to come seeking me if at a cer-
tain time he failed to return from
some mysterious rendezvous   

barters face was now a mask
of uncanny shrewdness in a
few words he had pierced through
ellens secret of why she had delib-
erately placed herself in the way of
barters minions in order to be taken
and now he had used the words of her
own questions to form a weapon
against her ellen gasped in terror

  had she made a hideous mistake
had she by failing to wait for word
from bentley ruined all his well laid
plans

  barter now stood before her his
eyes almost shooting fire

  tell me quickly he began and
for a second she thought he would
put his hands on her what sort of
plan is he making to betray me into
the hands of my enemies who are the
enemies of super-civilization because
they are my enemies

  i know of nothing said ellen
stoutly hoping that she had not
after all ietrayed the fact that she
knew bentley had started to work
out an unusual scheme the details
she didnt know for lee hadnt told
her but i do know what all the
world knows that he was helping the
police against you naturally then
when he vanished i thought of you
besides you had already warned him
that you would remove him in your
own good time he caused you the
loss of two of your puppets and i
thought naturally enough that you
would try to remove him to some
place where he could not operate so
successfully against you

  thats all  queried barter eager-
ly you dont know of some special
scheme that has been worked out to
trap me

  i know of no scheme now that i
am in your hands professor what do
you intend oing with me

  barter stared at ellen for several
minutes
esp

astounding stories

ssj

i llavent captured bentley   

      he said at last slowly but i
shall-no doubt about that it is in-
evitable-as inevitable as caleb bar-
ter i can use him in my labors for
humanity how i treat him after he
is taken depends somewhat on you
you may therefore consider yourself
a sort of hostage i have much med-
ical work to perform have you ever
been a nurse

ellen recoiled in horror

you dont mean you would
ask me to help you perform those
horrible- she stopped abruptly be-
fore her sudden tendency to hysterics
should make her say things to anger
barter too far

  so he said quickly you think
my brain operations are horrible eh
well you shall see that they are not
horrible that professor barter the
greatest scientist the world has ever
produced is really preparing to pre-
vent civilization from utterly decay-
ing 

  and afterward asked ellen i
know that eventually youwill be
taken and that the people will de-
stroy you tear you limb from limb
but you will never believe that tell
me then what you plan to do with
me

  for a brief time he considered the
matter

  i am an old man he said at last
musingly but i am young in spirit
and in body it would be amusing to
have a mate-but no no that would
not do the destiny of caleb barter
is not linked with a woman you
would simply hold me back how-
ever i have often been interested in
miscegenation and its effect on the
race if properly guided my assistant
naka machi is one of the finest
specimens of his race perhaps i
shall arrange for you to mate with
him under conditions which i shall
dictate in order to experiment with
your offspring  

  ellen swayed her face going dead

white she hadnt yet met naka
machi but his name told her enough
the thought of a japanese however
was far less repellent than the cold
calm way in which barter spoke of
using the offspring of such a union

  ill kill myself at the first oppor-
tunity said ellen suddenly

barter put his forefinger un-
der ellens chin in a paternal
fashion his eyes looked deeply into
hers she thought of what his fingers
had done in the past    those long
slender fingers his touch made her
shudder

  but his eyes held her they seemed
like deep wells then they were like
black coals advancing upon her out
of the darkness growing bigger and
bigger as they came with little
flames in their centers also growing
as they approached

  you will submit your will to
mine said the soft voice of caleb
barter

  his right hand was making swift
snakelike movements back of ellens
head his voice droned on but
already it seemed to ellen to come
from a vast distance

  your minjpfll be concerned only
with the welfare of caleb barter
droned on the voice you will think
only of caleb barter your greatest
desire will be to serve him there is
nothing you would not do for him
let your objective mind sleep until
caleb barter wakens it give your
subjective mind into my keeping

  beads of perspiration broke out on
the cheeks of caleb barter as he
worked quickly to place the girl en-
tirely under his skilled hypnosis at
last she stood like a statue her wide-
open eyes staring into space straight
ahead she did not move she
scarcely seemed to breathe

  you will know that my home is
your home ellen said barter softly
you will feel that you are welcome
here and that you love this place it
needs the attention of a loving wo-

i
the mind master



nran you will give it that attention
but you will be subservient always
to my will you will enter upon
your duties

  ellen estabrook sighed softly as
though with relief her hands went
up to remove her hat which she
placed on a chair in a corner of the
hellish laboratory she removed her
light coat and arranged her hair with
skilled fingers but even as she moved
around the room of thelong table her
eyes stared vacantly into space she
was as much a puppet of caleb bar-
ter as were stanley morton and
cleve but mercifully she did not
know it

barter studied her for several
nanents his eyes squinted he
was idfting sure that she was not
duping him with pretense satisfied
at last he turned his eyes away from
her he stepped to the porcelain slab
set in the bronze wall of his labora-
tory and looked at the push-buttons
marked c- and e- the red
lights were on indicating that the
two puppets controlled by these two
keys were returning toward their
master the lights had been green
when barter had begun his conversa-
tion with ellen estabrook indicat-
ing that the two puppets were still
going away with a tremendous
effort of will he had given them suf-
ficient mental stimulus to keep them
traveling without his direct will for
the few minutes he would require for
ellen

  now however he quickly donned
the metal cap and the little ball and
inserted into the orifice in his cap the
swinging key which connected by
chain with the key which fitted into
the slot under the button marked
c-

  he had returned to his puppets

just in time c- was cleve who
was driving the car sent out to bring
in the colombian ape as barter got
in touch with the car it narrowly
averted a crash with a police car   

and the perspiration broke forth
afresh on the body of barter as he
resumed control of his puppets

  the second creature in the front
seat of the car was morton and it
didnt matter particularly about him
as he was not driving but morton
was now becoming all ape barter did
not wish to use any more of his men-
tal energy than was necessary he
contented himself by sending his
will into cleve who began at once to
drive like a master whenever mor-
ton beside him showed an inclina-
tion to jump out of the car or other-
wise interfere with cleve in his
work barter had but to express the
thought and cleve either pulled him
back to his place beside him or gave
him a walnut from his pocket

barter could as easily have
had them change places since
he assumed control of either at will
or could have controlled a score
simultaneously but that would have
required additional thought stimu-
lus and he wished to conserve his
mental energies for the work which
yet faced him

 once he switched his attention
from the heliotube which controlled
cleve-and through which concur-
rently he saw everything that
transpired near cleve because his
televisory apparatus and his radio
control were co-workers on almost
identical vibratory waves-to the
area of manhattan immediately sur-
rounding his own neighborhood

  hmm he said to himself the
police are getting too close as soon
as i have completed my labors to-
night i shall destroy some of them
as a warning to others to keep their
distance

  morton and cleve drew up to the
curb while barter watched carefully
on all sides through the heliotube
to make sure that their arrival was
unmarked by the police

 they climbed out quickly and
raced across the sidewalk to the
               v-   -   w

astounding stories

grn gate which gave on a gloomy
old court inside which they were
swallowed by the shadows from all
eyes save those of caleb barter

  five minutes after the strange trio
had entered the place the great
chrome-steel door of barters lab-
oratory swung open

  morton and cleve my master
announced naka machi bowing low
and sucking in his breath with a hiss-
ing sound

  barters own puppets entered with
the ape between them

  barter walked fearlessly forward
he had slipped the key from the ori-
fice atop his head morton and cleve
now stood listlessly dumbly look-
ing with dead eyes at their master
barter tossed them several walnuts
each

  then he turned his attention to the
ape rubbing his hands together with
pleasure

  but the ape was behaving strange-
ly his eyes were staring past barter
his hands sought to lift as though he
would hold them out to someone but
the ropes prevented him barter
turned to look ellen estabrook
stood beyond him white of face mo-
tionless as a statue the ape was
straining toward her

  caleb barter chuckled with under-
standing

  good evening lee he said gent-
ly ive been expecting you

chapter xiii
where the bodies went

bentley had been bound care-
lessly who could expect ape
brains to devise clever bonds even
when controlled by caleb barter
and now it seemed that caleb barter
had known all along he said he had
been expecting bentley no that
wasnt it barter had seen him yearn-
ing toward ellen estabrook statu-
esque and wide-eyed on the other
side of the room if it hadnt been
for the presence of ellen he might

have been accepted as sn ape now it
made little difference

  but his bonds were not tightly
drawn he found himself fighting
them fiercely trying to get his hands
on caleb barter he could see the
scrawny adams apple of the mad
scientist and his fingers itched to
press themselves into the flesh

  caleb barter stood his ground
calmly naka machi he said softly

  suddenly bentley felt a dull para-
lyzing blow on his skull he knew it
had been intended to render him ut-
terly unconscious but naka machi
hadnt taken into consideration that
his skull was protected by the hide
of an ape he remembered as he
stumbled and fell forward that the
japanese were wizards with their
hands thats why naka machi could
knock him down render him help-
less yet leave his brain as clearly ac-
tive as before perhaps clearer even
for now his brain did not act on his
legs and arms which were helpless

  bentley felt as he imagined a pa-
tient on the operating table might
feel when not given sufficient anes-
thetic yet given enough to make him
incapable of speech or movement
such a patient would hear the soft
discussions of the surgeons see them
prepare their instruments yet be un-
able to tell them that he wasnt en-
tirely unconscious

barter stooped over bentley
and rolled back the lids of his

eyes

  good naka machi he said he
wont be in any position to do us an
injury remain powerless lee bent-
ley but retain your knowledge

  barter then was familiar with the
strange hypnosis which the blow of
naka machis hand had put upon
bentley barter had taken advantage
of it to add to it a sort of mental
paralysis so that the condition would
continue

  you are in my hands lee he
said in paternal fashion but you
can do me no harm since you were
associated with me in the first of my
great experiments you know much
about me i have never ceased to hope
that you would one day understand
and appreciate what i am doing for
humanity and be brought to aid me
perhaps if i force you to watch my
efforts you will understand them and
sympathize with my ambitions
bentley could say nothing bar-
ters eyes seemed to leap at him
growing large and glaring just as
the eyes of caricatured animals leap
at the camera in trick motion pic-
tures physically he was powerless
only his brain was active

  remove this covering from him
naka machi went on barter re-
move his bonds you are about his
size garb him in some of your own
clothing

  bentley had the odd feeling that
he didnt need to turn his head to see
things around him his head felt
huge ahfcost to bursting and his
eyes felt huge too so that he could
see in all directions as though his
eyeballs had been fish-eye lenses

he studied naka machi a nasty
opponent in a fight he decid-
ed he hadnt figured on any oppo-
nent other than barter this man was
almost as great the skill of his
fingers as he quickly removed the ape
skin from bentley using scalpels
taken from barters table amazed
bentley with their miraculous dex-
terity he cleaned bentleys body
with some solution in a sponge and
clothed him in some of his own cloth-
ing which fitted fairly well

  then he lifted bentley from the
floor and stood him against the wall

  bentley was unbound he tried to
lift his hands but they refused to
move his feet too seemed anchored
to the floor his knees were stiff and
straight he might as well have been
a wooden image for all his ability to
get about

  now barter spoke

  come here lee he said

  bentley was amazed at the kindli-
ness in barters attitude he dealt
with bentley as though he had been
his son he felt that barter genu-
inely liked him it was rather amaz-
ing barter liked him but would re-
move him without compunction if he
thought it necessary

  bentley found he could move his
feet or rather they seemed to move
of their own volition as he crossed
the room to stand before barter

  im rather proud of what i have
been able to do lee went on bar-
ter and i am now entirely safe from
the police ive issued another mani-
festo telling the public that for each
attempt made against me one of the
eighteen men captured by me to-
day will die manhattan is the abode
of terror here see for yourself

  he extended to bentley what
seemed to be a pair of binoculars but
with the ear-hooks common to or-
dinary spectacles he set them over
bentleys eyes and set them in place

  now you can survey new york
as you wish

bentley looked for a moment
or two sixth avenue was a
deserted highway on which red and
green lights blinked off and on in the
usual routine signaling to drivers
who were non-existent there were
vistas of deserted streets and ave-
nues there were some few living
things-policemen in uniform stand-
ing in pairs and larger groups all
concentrated in an area covering no
more than twenty acres which twen-
ty acres included the hideout of
caleb barter bentley knew that the
hideout was under millegan place
he had recognized it coming in a
secret panel in a brick wall had
opened to show a door where none
was apparent then a circular stair-
way leading down into darkness to
the room which barter had gouged
out of the earth and turned into a
laboratory of hell
           police asked barter
know now where i am but
are helpless because of my
hostages i shall now begin the op-
erations i believe to be necessary
then i shall issue another manifesto
telling the public that i am safe-
guarded by great apes whose ability
will prove the correctness of my
theory about the possibility of cre-
ating a race of supermen my mani-
festo shall say that my apes must not
be slain it shall say that for every
ape slain by the police one of my
eighteen hostages will die

  bentley would have gasped with
horror but he could not now he saw
thomas tyler his face a white mask
of despair in the midst of his help-
less men

  ill give you a hand somehow
tommy bentley whispered deep
down inside him

 now you shall see what i do
lee said caleb barter naka
machi bring the ape skin you took
from my friend bentley you will
follow us

barter removed the strange
glasses from bentleys eyes
blotting out the deserted streets and
avenues of manhattan naka machi
followed behind bentley carrying
the ape skin in which bentley had
penetrated the stronghold of caleb
barter

 the chrome-steel door swung
silently back and the three entered
another room filled with blazing
light without being able to look
back bentley knew that ellen white
of face and staring followed at their
heels

  there was a long white operating
table in this room and a smaller
chrome-steel door set some four feet
above the floor in one wall

 naka machi the incineration
tube said barter brusquely

  naka machi stepped to the operat-
ing table and dug into one of the
drawers he brought out a white

tube closed at one end about an inch
in diameter eight inches in length
and snowy white

  concentrated fire bentley said
barter watch

  barter had naka machi cast the
ape skin through the small steel door
beyond which bentley could see a
boxlike space large enough to ac-
commodate two or three grown men
lying side by side at full length it
seemed to be indirectly lighted the
ape skin dropped on the floor of this
compartment barter took the in-
cineration tube and directed it on
the skin bentley heard the clicking
of a button

 the ape skin charred quickly
folded up drew into itself disap-
peared-and a fine gray ash settled
on the floor of the compartment like
rain from the roof of the ghastly lit-
tle space

  now you understand that i have
solved the problem of disposing of
the cumbersome useless bodies of my
hostages lee said barter rubbing
his hands together as though he
washed them

  bentleys heart leaped as naka
machi placed the incineration tube
on the operating table it was close
enough that bentley could have
reached it had he not been utterly
powerless to move

  naka machi said barter bring
me ape d- and frank keller the
diplomat ellen clear the operating
table quickly now bentley stand
against the wall and do not move-
but miss nothing i do

chapter xiv
the straining prison

then began a grim series of ac-
tivities which combined to form
a nightmare bentley was never to
forget even as he prayed within him
that no slightest memory of it would
remain in the brain of ellen esta-
brook

  naka machi went back to the room
the mind master	   - 

  which bentley had first entered and
  returned almost at once with a tall
  thin man immaculately garbed in
  gray wearing a spade beard his
  eyes were flashing fires of anger and
  of pride

    he stared at barter

   what is all this quackery he
 demanded who is responsible for
 this unspeakable rigmarole

   your words are harsh mr kel-
 ler said barter suavely and you
 shall learn in good time what i in-
 tend had you followed my mani-
 festoes in the news columns you
 would have known what i intend i
 shall create a race of super-

   you will at once release myself
 and the others with me interrupted
 keller

   but at that moment naka machi
 returned leading a great ape which
 seemed as docile as though it had
 been drugged naka machi raised his
 right hand quickly so quickly bent-
 ley could scarce follow the move-
 ment and with the edge of his palm
 struck the tall gray man in back of
 the head kellers knees buckled as
 he started to fall naka machi stepped
 close to him gathered him in his
 arms and bore him to the table

   at barters swift instructions
 ellen estabrook all unknowing
 placed a cone indicated by barter
 over the mouth and nose of keller
 naka machi struck the ape as he had
 struck the man but he waited until
 he had persuaded the brute to take
 his place on the table near kellers
 head

 the ape sprawled naka machi
quickly twisted both keller
 and the ape around so that their
heads were toward ach other their
feet pointing in opposite directions

    is that close enough my master
  came the soft voice of naka machi

   quite said barter whose face
 was now a mask of concentration
 cleve and stanley and morton
 they have been locked in their

cages my master said naka machi
are you sure this man who came in
the guise of an ape is safe

  i shall make sure but do you re-
main close where you can render
him harmless in case i have mis-
judged him

  naka machi turned baleful eyes on
bentley the latter could see the
hatred in them and for a moment was
at loss to understand it

  i shall destroy him before he can
put his hands upon you my master
said naka machi

  i do not wish him destroyed naka
machi replied barter that is
enough of the anesthetic miss esta-
brook naka machi my instruments
quickly

  before he proceeded with his
labors barter stood in front of bent-
ley and stared at him for a moment
bentley felt the strength flow out of
him under the gaze of this man-a
gaze he could not avoid barter
smiled slightly

  you will eventually join me of
your own free will lee he said
softly

  i would rather die a thousand
deaths screamed bentley but the
sound of his scream echoed and re-
echoed through his soul without
coming out so that barter could hear
it

barters confidence in his abil-
ity to convert bentley was as-
suredly a mark of his twisted mind
for he must surely have realized that
bentley would be the most injured
by his schemes but he seemed to as-
sociate him with the days of manape
when barter had proved to himself
to bentley and ellen estabrook that
the operation he now planned in
wholesale proportions was possible
bentley could understand why bar-
ter regarded him as a friend and col-
league and his animosity temporary
-because as a subject of his first
great experiment bentley was a sym-
bol of barters success
astounding stories

y gwige how  easy it was to find
igic in the reasoning of madmen
and to understand that logic

  barter sprang back to his task
naka machi he said take heed
that you serve me well do you like
this woman

  yes my master

  if you continue in your loyalty to
me i shall give her to you

  bentleys mind recoiled with hor-
ror the shock of this cold statement
was like another blow on the head
he wanted to leap forward and set
strangling fingers about the neck of
naka machi ordinarily naka machi
could handle him with ease but now
that bentley had heard the plan o
barter he could have handled the
japanese with superhuman strength
but he could not move he strained
against the bodily lethargy which
held him prisoner if only he could
move forward and grasp the incinera-
tion tube he would turn it on naka
machi and barter   

  but he could not move could not
fight off the lethargy which was like
invincible prison walls around him

  he could move the tips of his
fingers he discovered  but no more
than that the shock of barters calm
statement had cast off that much of
his semi-hypnotic lethargy a minute
before he hadnt been able even to
move his fingers

give him time he told himself
while inwardly he bled as he
struggled desperately to throw off
the grim hypnosis and he would yet
manage to save the lives of at least
some of the eighteen see that ellen
won free and destroy this hell-hole
under millegan place

  now incredibly slender instru-
ments were busy near the heads of
the two on the operating table-the
ape and keller the doomed man as
the knives and scalpels leaped to
their work with startling dexterity
and amazing speed bentley strained
again against his horrid invisible

prison if only he could save this
man keller from this horror    but

it was useless

 the fingers of barter worked
swiftly over the skull of the ape
first naka machi stood on one side
of the long table ellen on the other
near barter bentley studied her face
as the skull of the ape fell open un-
der the hands of barter and he knew
she was unaware of what she was do-
ing bentley had expected a crimson
horror but nothing of the kind de-
veloped could barter read his
thoughts

  i am an adept at bloodless sur-
gery bentley he said while his
fingers never ceased their swift
manipulations

  now naka machi held the skull-
pan of the ape from which he had
removed the reddish substance which
was the apes brain this naka
machi had tossed into the aperture
where the ape skin had been de-
stroyed

 the empty skull-pan of the ape
awaited the brain of keller

  bentley could feel the sweat burst
forth on him in every pore as he tried
to throw off his awful inertia to go
to the aid of keller if barter should
see the perspiration on his cheeks 

  bentley thought of samson in the
midst of his enemies blind and
beaten of how he had prayed to be
given strength to pull down the pil-
lars of the temple   

  oh god said bentley to himself
only this once give me strength to
throw off these chains grant that i
do something to save the man from
this horror

but he could still move only the
tips of hisfingers when barter
had finally closed the sutures in the
skull-pan of the ape renewing again
the apes skull with the brain of
keller inside keller was finished he
had not moved on the table even his
chest stood still stark and lifeless
barter had not troubled to restore
                 the mind master



kellers skull-pan what was the
need

  naka machi gathered up the car-
cass of keller and bore it swiftly to
the boxlike hole in the wall of the
ghastly room   

  he thrust it in he stepped back
and caught up the incineration tube
of concentrated fire    and bentley
saw the body of the murdered man
shrivel up so quickly it seemed as
though it had dissolved before his
eyes down from the ceiling of the
hell-hole dropped the fine gray ash
all that remained-save the impris-
oned brain-of frank keller the
diplomat

 now bentley was cognizant of
something else with barters con-
centrated work on keller something
of the power went out of him ever
so slightly bentley could feel that
barter was lacking in strength some
of his will some of the essential
essence of his brain of his soul had
been expended in the operation-and
by so much was bentley enabled to
move for now he could move two
full fingers on each hand but how
carefully he kept watch to see that
neither naka machi nor barter
noticed that he was bursting from his
invisible prison

  if he could get that incineration
tube hed do the necessary things
first  then direct the ray of it
against the softer portions of the
hideout of barter the flame would
eat through somewhere it would
finally reach wood that was inflam-
mable

  there would be smoke and fire 
and in the end people would come
tyler would be watching for a sign
anyway barter had said that the
police knew approximately where he
barter was located

tt ow bentley said barter
an ill explain what i intend
doing while i rest a moment before
the next ordeal the whole world is
against me now because it regards

my experiments as horrible but if i
prove to the world that i am right
and that the men of my creation are
supermen in the end the world will
be on my side i can force it to obey
me in time but i prefer the world to
serve me willingly because it real-
izes that what i do for civilization
should really be done

  bentley said nothing because he
could not speak

  ill send keller to his office under
my instructions said barter of
course ill issue a manifesto first so
that the city will know that it is not
a wild ape that has escaped when
the new keller with the strong brain
of keller and the mighty body of an
ape appears at his office and proves
to his people that he has been vastly
improved by my experiment  

  bentley tried to shut hi mind to
the horrible picture barters words
drew before his eyes barter broke
off short while bentleys mind
seemed to rock with the shock of
barters last statement he saw a pic-
ture  a great office filled with
many desks occupied by white-faced
men and women  an ornate desk
where a manape sat  it was
ghastly beyond comprehension it
must never come to pass

  barter spoke again to naka machi

  bring me david fator and ape
s-

  yes my master replied naka
machi

again bentley went through
the horror from beginning to
end he could now move his toes if
only he could fall forward grasp
that incineration tube turn it on
barter with barter unable to con-
trol him he would regain his senses
in time he hoped to stave off the cer-
tain charge of naka machi whose
hatred for himself he now under-
stood too well

  he hoped if he were able to accom-
plish what he planned that horror
upon awakening would cause ellen
- as

to faint while she was out he could
destroy the horror with the cleans-
ing flame    and tell her she hadnt
seen it after all

  bentley could feel the strength
pour back into him barter was be-
coming moment by moment more in-
tent on his labors he was becoming
careless with bentley not because he
underestimated him but because he
was intensely absorbed in his work

 by the time two more men had
gone bodily into the incinerator and
mentally into a pair of apes the first
ape carelessly dumped on the floor
came out from under the effects of
the drug

  stand over there in the corner
keller barter said to the hybrid
carelessly and remember that no
matter how you may wish to escape
you can only do so if i will remain
quiet there and consider whether you
will oppose me or obey me oppose
me and your only escape is self-
destruction obey me and possess the
world

  bentley could imagine the horror
and despair of keller for he him-
self had known that horror and de-
spair

  now he could swing his wrists
slightly naka machi turned once
with a sudden movement and almost
caught him at it and perspiration
broke out on bentleys face again
thank god ellen realized none of
what she was experiencing

two other men gave their lives
at barters hands   yet bent-
ley had only regained sufficient pos-
session of himself to fall forward
on his face if he tried to walk but
even that was something

  five men were gone now could
he possibly regain muscular control
in time to save the lives of some of
the eighteen as he watched the five
go into the furnace one by one he
began to despair of saving any of the
eighteen but with each operation
barter lost mental strength if he

astounding storiss 

lost in arithmetical progression as be
had during the last five bentley esti-
mated that he bentley would be
able to move his arms enough to
grasp the incineration tube by the
time barter had finished his eighth
transplantation

 so the horror growing until
nausea ate at bentleys stomach like
voracious maggots he watched bar-
ter destroy three more men and cre-
ate godless monsters in their places
as each manape regained conscious-
ness barter told him what he had
told keller-and naka machi took
them out one by one and placed
them in their allotted cages

  naka machi placed the eighth man
in the furnace returned the incin-
eration tube to the table

 now oh god the father
moaned bentley

  he leaned forward striving with
all his will to force his hands to go
truly to their target as he fell he
had little or no control of his legs or
knees but let him once hold that
tube in his hands   

  he fell soundlessly his hands
clutching for the tube his fingers
touched it as he crashed to the floor
and it fell near him his fingers
fumbled for the tube and now
gripped it tightly

  from under the table writhing
and twisting striving to break his
mental bondage bentley saw the legs
of caleb barter he snapped the but-
ton on the tube and turned its open
end toward those legs

  i must not look into his eyes as
he falls thought bentley or all is
lost

a terrible scream rang
through the operating room
barter was falling crumpling as he
fell and as his body slid downward
past the table edge bentley held the
end of the tube toward it as the
bodies of the eight had shriveled so
shriveled the body of caleb barter

  ellen estabrook screamed horri-
the mind master

bly and sprawled on the floor with-
in a foot or two of bentley nature
had mercifully sent her into mo-
mentary oblivion when the will of
barter holding her in thrall had
snapped to show her the horror of
what she did

  naka machi was screaming bent-
ley was bentley again crawling
forth from under the table naka
machi met him in a rush and dis-
solved before the deadly ray as
though he had never existed its ef-
fect must have been a silent explo-
sion for a fine gray ash came down
from the ceiling as the residue which
falls when a soaring rocket has ex-
ploded and expended its power the
gray ash was naka machi forever
rendered harmless to ellen

  bentley walked over and stood
looking at the manapes in their
cages what could be done with
them there was no hope no possi-
ble way by which they could resume
their normal lives for of their human
bodies there remained but heaps of
fine powdery ashes

  suddenly the manape keller swept
his great hairy arm out between the
bars and snatched the tube from
bentleys hand with a cry of mortal
anguish bentley recoiled from the
cage god now all was lost if the
manape clicked on the deadly ray
and swept it over the room

  before he could formulate a plan
of action the manape pressed the
fatal button with a cry bentley
threw himself across the room to
where ellen lay unconscious his
only thought to somehow protect
her from the tube

but the manape keller swung
the ray upon the other apes
with the human minds and they dis-
solved into ashy nothingness with
bewildering rapidity the keen mind
of keller was doing what he knew
must be done for the good of every-
one concerned

  numbed with horror bentley saw
the ray directed on morton and
stanley they fell silently and with-
out protest   

  keller clicked off the button and
looked over at bentley he alone re-
mained of barters frightful experi-
ment he alone remained and it
seemed that he was trying to tell
bentley something    asking him
to now take the tube and turn it full
on the body which housed his human
brain

  while bentley hesitated the man-
ape bent down and placed the tube
on the floor of the cage the muzzle
pointing inward with a clumsy mo-
tion of a long hairy arm he reached
out and snicked on the button then
placed himself within its deadly
range keller vanished and the ray
bit into the wall back of the cage
began to eat through

  bentley leaped to his feet and tore
across the floor he plunged his
trembling hand through the bars of
the cage switched off the button and
lifted the tube

  there were the remaining normal
apes they could have been saved for
transportation to the zoo but horror
was on bentley and he used the tube
again and yet again   

  and there were the keys he pulled
them from their slots in the porcelain
slab in case there should be other
stanley-morton-cleves abroad of
whom he knew nothing   

  he turned the tube against the red
lights and the green lights

  then he turned the tube upward
and held it steadily he watched the
charred hole grow bigger and deeper
in the high ceiling   

  when at last he heard the ap-
proaching clang of the fire engine
bells and the screaming triumph of
police sirens he carefully snicked off
the button of the tube and returned
to lift the form of ellen in arms that
were strong to hold her

when the rolling thunder
of infra-bass first came
to their ears robert
blake and helen lawton

were standing on --

the platform of a

press to bear them to their homes

  they made a strikingly attractive
couple as they stood there new

     zehru of xollar

ure was still conspicuous for the
lithe strength that had made him an
all-western tackle less than two
years ago

  standing beside blakes husky fig-
ure helen lawton looked like a
tiny very perfect blonde doll with
an exquisitely molded face framed
in curly bobbed hair that was the
clear golden-amber hue of orange
honey there was a diamond spar-
kling on the ring finger of the girls
slim left hand placed there by blake

  it was well after midnight and the
only other passenger waiting on the
station was a burly chap leaning
against one of the white pillars on
the other side of the platform after
a casual glance at the fellow with
his derby hat shoved far back from a
low forehead his blatantly conspic-
uous clothing and the suspicious
bulge under one arm-pit blake had
mentally set him down as a minor
gangster probably a strong-arm man
for some beer mob

  blake and helen had been stand-
ing there but a few minutes when
the strange sound first became audi-
ble for a moment blake thought it
was merely the rumbling roar of an
express approaching far down the
tunnel then he realized that no
subway train could possibly produce
a sound effect so oddly disturbing
and strangely alien

  it was like no sound that blake
had ever heard before vibrant with
colossal power it suggested a sus-
tained note struck from a giant or-
gan a note so low in pitch that it
seemed a full octave below the low-
est bass note ever struck whatever
it was the thundering vibration of
infra-bass was coming nearer with
startling swiftness

it was impossible to locate the
source of the mighty pulsing
note it seemed to be coming simul-
taneously from all directions like a
great hollow sphere of invisible
sound waves closing in with the sta-

tion platform as its central focal

point

  helens face was white with dread
as she shrank closer into blakes em-
brace blake noted that the gangster
across the platform was standing
tensely at bay with his back against
the pillar and his right hand thrust
under his coat as he stared wildly
about him in an effort to discover the
cause of the disturbance

  the rolling thunder closed in
upon them with a final rush that
brought it so near that their very
bodies seemed to vibrate in harmony
with that mighty note of shuddering
bass then with startling abrupt-
ness the green net came

  out from the walls and down from
the roof spurted scores of quivering
ribbons of blinding green flame
swiftly the radiant tendrils rushed
in upon the shrinking three from
every side while the infra-bass
thundered in mighty crescendo

  blake instinctively swept helen
close within the shelter of his arms
in an effort to protect her with his
own body against the searing men-
ace of those onrushing green flames
the next moment the fiery ribbons
were upon them lashing about their
bodies crossing and crisscrossing in
the air above and around them in a
great tangled web of interlacing
lines of flame that filled the entire
platform

with a shock of relief blake
found that there was no heat
in those strange flames but his re-
lief was short-lived as the next sec-
ond brought him realization of the
real menace of the radiant ribbons
there was a solidity and strength in
those glowing streamers that held
them as helplessly captive as though
they were gripped in ribbons of
steel dazed and helpless the three
struggled for a moment in the
meshes of the weird net of flame like
fish caught in the strands of some
giant cosmic seine

astounding stories

ssf

r	trembling thunder of infra-

jibass abruptly changed to a thin
 whining note so high in pitch that it
 seemed the nearly soundless ghost
 of a metallic scream vith the
 change in sound blake became aware
 of a new and astounding change in
 his surroundings

 the walls and roof of the station
 seemed closing in upon him as
 though he were growing in size at
 an incredible rate the next moment
 he shot through the roof hurtling
 on and upward with the velocity of
 a rocket the sensation was one that
 his reeling brain could not even
 grasp his body seemed to be inside
 every stone iron bar and lump of
 earth yet at the same time every ex-
 terior object seemed within his body
 it was an eery chaos of a dozen dif-
 ferent dimensions blending to form
 a space in which there was no
 known dimension

   as they flashed on out to the sur-
 face blake had one hazy glimpse of
 manhattans glowing lights spread
 all about them then the speed of
 their progress leaped into a new and
 terrible acceleration that blotted out
 eveiy tangible sensation from
 blakes brain

  time and space alike seemed to
vanish as their hurtling flight sent
them rocketing on for distances in-
conceivably vast through a bleak and
appalling nothingness where neith-
er sight nor sound existed

   then abruptly the speed of their
 flight seemed to be lessening sen-
 sation returned to blake he again
 heard the thin high-pitched metallic
 wail now swiftly deepening to the
 familiar growl of rolling bass he
 again noted the presence of the glow-
 ing green ribbons of the net that
 still encircled them

a blindingly brilliant purple
mist was now closing in upon
them from every direction bringing
with it a nameless and agonizing
force that seemed to be shaking the

very atoms in blakes body asunder
then they dropped swiftly down out
of the purple mists and the strange
agony at once vanished blake felt
their downward progress come to an
end with the gentle arrival of his
feet upon firm ground

  the encircling net of green flame
glowed dazzlingly brighter for a
brief moment then swiftly vanished
into thin air while the mutter of
bass vibrations simultaneously died
away into silence blake staggered
and nearly fell as the sudden re-
lease from the nets strands again
left his body free

  he looked down at helen as she
stood huddled close beside him still
in the shelter of his arms the girls
face was white with terror as she
looked back up at him

 bob what happened-and where
on earth are we her voice trem-
bled a little in spite of her plucky
effort to keep it steady

  blakes bewildered gaze was al-
ready roving around them trying to
comprehend the incredible details of
their surroundings ive no idea
what happened dear he answered
slowly as to where we are now
im very much afraid its nowhere on
earth

 then where is this hopped-up
layout anyway fellah if it aint on
earth broke in a voice with a de-
cided east side twang blake quick-
ly turned and saw that the gangster
had remained with them in that eery
flight in the green net there was an
expression of dumfounded amaze-
ment upon the mans heavy face and
he was obviously anxious to be
friendly with the two who now rep-
resented the only link with the fa-
miliar world he had known

  gee for a minute i thought they
had me on the spot in some new way
sure he chattered excitedly as he
came quickly over to join helen and
blake theres plenty of guys
wantin to turn the heat on me there
in the big town im gil mapes
zehru of xollar



see but this aint no frame-up like
any i ever heard of what happened
anyway fellah

for the moment blake did not
answer the three of them were
silent as they stared about them with
eyes that were dazed by the star-
tlingly unfamiliar aspect of every
detail in their surroundings

 from the twin purple suns that
blazed down through the tenuous
mists overhead to the barren blue-
gray ground underfoot there was
not a single object familiar to earth-
ly eyes the huge enclosure in which
the three of them stood was obvi-
ously the work of intelligent beings
of some kind but its mechanical de-
tails were products of a science dif-
ferent from any known to blake

 the purpose of the enclosure
seemed to be to maintain an area of
clear air in the midst of the swirl-
ing purple vapors that pressed in
against it from the top and from
every side in shape it was a great
oblong cell some fifty feet high two
hundred yards long and about one
hundred yards wide the three cap-
tives stood near the center

  fencing in the enclosure at twen-
ty-yard intervals and reaching up-
ward to the ceiling were slender
posts of some lusterless black metal
between these posts streamed un-
broken nearly transparent sheets of
some unknown force the only visi-
ble sign of which was the presence
of countless millions of tiny shim-
mering golden flecks which danced
like dust motes in a ray of sunlight
it was obviously this thin sheet of
unknown force that was keeping the
purple mists at bay for fan-like an-
tennae at the top of each post spread
a similar shimmering sheet that
formed a ceiling for the dear-aired
area

the three earthlings were fac-
ing one of the sidewalls of the
big enclosures the purple mists

outside made it hard to see clearly
for any distance but blake had an
impression that the surrounding ter-
rain was featured by the same bar-
ren nearly desert bleakness that
characterized the interior of the en-
closure where scattered clumps of
dead spiky black branches of shrub-
like vegetation were the only sign of
plant life

  just within the distant end wall
at their right there was a low plat-
form surmounted by a wide arch
some ten feet in height both con-
structed of silver-colored metal
there was nothing between them
and the endwall to their left but
they could see that the ground
sloped sharply upward from the bar-
rier-sheet and on the crest of the
ridge a gigantic cone-shaped struc-
ture of solid black could be seen
dimly through the intervening mists

  the cone-building seemed to be
the source of the power that kept the
enclosure intact slender cables of
black metal ran down the slope from
it into the clear-aired space spread-
ing out over the dusty gray-blue
ground to the base of each of the
tall posts with a heavier copper-tol-
ored cable running on the silver
arch from within the windowless
interior of the cone there was audi-
ble a low hum as of tremendous
power being generated there

  gee what a rummy joint this
place is there was frank awe in
the gangsters voice as he at last
broke the silence that guy with
the green net sure took us for one
sweet ride mebbe were on the moon
now or on mar hub

  blake shook his bead no were
completely oat of our entire solar
system those twin purple suns up
there grove that we may even be in
anoth universe or another dimen-
sion from our own a piece of appa-
ratus that could whisk us up through
fifty feet of earth and masonry as
that green net did obviously works
in dimensions of which weve never

dreamed the only thing were sure
of is that we were brought to this
purple world deliberately and inten-
tionally by an intelligent being of
some kind scooped up like tadpoles
from a mud-puddle and dumped here
in this elaborate enclosure it had
already prepared for us

b

i lake nodded to where the
black cone-building loomed
through the purple mists outside the
end-wall whoever or whatever the
thing was that brought us here i
have a hunch its there in that
power-house watching us id sug-
gest that we walk down toward that
end of the enclosure for a closer
look we may at least find out
whether were guests or prisoners
listens good to me fellah
agreed mapes sliding a hand up to
his shoulder holster and bringing
out a squat black automatic pistol of
heavy caliber well do a prowl
over that way and if his nibs tries
any more funny business mebbe a
few slugs outta this rod will change
his mind for him

 better go easy with the gun
mapes advised blake as the three
of them started sloyyly toward the
cone-building from what weve al-
ready seen there must be weapons
in this world that would make your
pistol look like a kids pop-gun
wed better go easy till-wait
whats that

  the thin high-pitched whine fol-
lowed promptly by the familiar
growling thunder of infra-bass had
again become audible at the same
moment a long pencil-like beam of
green light glowed into visibility
extending from the tip of the cone
to a point high within the enclosure
just back of them as they halted
abruptly and watched they saw the
interlacing meshes of the green
flame-net materialize suddenly at the
end of the beam

  the beam curved into an arc that
dropped the net swiftly to the

ground some thirty yards from them
its meshes were packed nearly full
of dark writhing figures

  looks like some more tadpoles
arriving for our pond mapes ex-
claimed i wonder what part of
n yawk his nibs yanked these ba-
bies from

blakes answer died on his lips
as the net and beam glowed
blindingly brighter for a brief sec-
ond then disappeared leaving the
dark figures in full view helen
choked back a gasp of horror mapes
swore in consternation and hurried-
ly swung his pistol into line with
those writhing shapes

  the nets latest captives were not
from new york nor were they from
any other part of the planet earth
hideous spawn of some unknown
world out in the black void of space
they writhed for a moment in a
nightmare chaos of countless brown-
furred bodies then swiftly disentan-
gled themselves before the staring
eyes of the three earthlings

  the things were apparently too
low in the mental scale to have any
reaction to their situation other than
a blind instinct to attack any other
living being within reach for they
promptly headed for the three cap-
tives from earth

  as the creatures came shambling
rapidly forward on powerful bowed
legs and with the tips of their long
hairy arms brushing the ground they
looked like grotesquely distorted
apes the crowning horror of those
shambling figures however lay in
the fact that they were completely
headless

  even when the things approached
to a distance of less than ten feet
before halting in momentary indeci-
sion blake could detect no sign of
any normal skull in the blunt space
at the top of the powerful hairy
torso there was a furry-lipped
mouth opening of some kind in the
hollow between the bulging shoul-
zehru of xollar

m

ders but of eyes ears nose or brain
cavity there was no discernible trace

  for a long moment the headless
ape-things and the three human be-
ings stood silently facing each other
mapes pistol was leveled pointblank
at the nearest of the creatures but
their overwhelming numbers made
the gangster hold his fire

  there were two distinct groups of
the things at least twenty members
of each group were in the crowd fac-
ing the earthlings to the rear of
these attackers two oddly repulsive
objects were carried and carefully
shielded by picked guards of four
unusually large and powerful ape-
things

the nature of those two guarded
objects puzzled blake they
looked like large eggs of dirty-gray
jelly about a yard in length they
were obviously alive for their gela-
tinous masses quivered and trembled
in constant activity blake noted
that there seemed to be a curious
connection between the ebb and flow
of pulsations in the egg-masses and
the movements of the ape-things

  his attention was abruptly re-
called to the headless things in front
of him as they suddenly began sham-
bling forward again there was no
possible mistaking the intention of
those advancing horrors they were
moving to the attack

  they reached barely to blakes
shoulders but he realized that their
enormous numbers and hook-taloned
hands would make the result of the
battle almost a foregone conclusion
the fact that the headless things
were without eyes was no handicap
to them the swift certainty of their
movements proved that they had a
sense of sight of some kind that was
in every way as efficient as eyesight

  blake looked hurriedly around
him seeking a place where they
might be at the best possible advan-
tage in the impending battle there
was a small dense thicket of the

spiky dead branches half a dozen
yards to their right at blakes low
command the three made a dash for
the thicket arriving there they
ranged themselves against it with
their backs at least partially pro-
tected from attack

the maneuver seemed to puzzle
the ape-things for a moment
they stood passively watching the
retreat of the three until they had
reached the thicket then the crea-
tures again began slowly closing in
upon them blake snatched up a
dead branch from the ground near
the thicket and was delighted to
find that its weight and tough fiber
made it an excellent club

  he stripped off his topcoat and
passed it back to helen its tough
fabric heavily rubberized for proof
against rain might guard her head
and face at least momentarily from
those ripping talons if the headless
attackers came to close quarters
with helen safely behind them
blake and mapes turned grimly to
face the enemy

  the attack was prompt in coming
moving with the perfect synchroni-
zation of a single unit one of the
main groups came shambling in fol-
lowed an instant later by the other
group mapes pistol sent a bullet
crashing squarely into the nearest
attacker the creature staggered
momentarily then came lurching on
again apparently not even crippled
blake swung his heavy club in a
whistling arc that sent two of his ad-
versaries broken and writhing to the
ground

  he heard mapes pistol bark four
times more as the things closed in
then the gun was knocked from the
gangsters grip by a groping talon-
armed hand mapes tried to batter
back his assailants with his ntrrisd
fists but the flailing arms of the
horde knocked him from his feet
his limp body was promptly
tramped into unconsciousness by the
r  	astounding stories

trailing feet of the close-packed
group

  blake lashed the heavy club about
him with a burst of savage fury that
for ihe moment sent the furred hor-
rors reeling backward tieir re-
treat ended after a scant tvo yards
reforming their ranks they again
began cautiously shambling forward
in a new attack that blake realized
would probably mean the end

it was easy enough to batter the
things to ground but it seemed
impossible to seriously hurt them
their incredible vitality and their
overwhelming numbers made them
almost invincible grimly blake set
himself to battle as long as he could
in that last desperate effort to keep
the hordes at bay

  he noticed idly that the two
groups still kept their oddly sepa-
rated formation behind them the
two egg-masses of jelly were now
seething in new activity after a brief
lessening of their gruesome shiver-
ing blake now saw that there was a
direct and unmistakable connection
between the activity of the jelly and
the corresponding activity of the
ape-things

  realization of the fact sent a sud-
den flash of inspiration flaming
through blakes weary brain corre-
lating the real significance of a dozen
different things he had been subcon-
sciously noting ever since the first
appearance of the weird beasts

  those attacking things were not
hordes of individual animals they
were merely two complete organ-
isms with the members of each or-
ganism controlled by its nucleus
through invisibe lines of nervous
force as the various individual cells
of the human body are linked by
nerve fibers no wonder the crea-
tures themselves were blind the
egg-mass that was the nucleus of
each of the two groups was eyes
brain and seat of life for every ape-
thing in the group

  with a swift surge of hope blake
realized the way to conquer the
things if he could only shatter those
flaccid masses of jelly he would de-
stroy the swarming dozens of beasts
at the same time

  reaching the jelly ovoids seemed
at first consideration to be an impos-
sible task they were carefully
guarded far in the rear of the attack-
ing groups blake knew that he had
scarcely a chance in a hundred of
battering his way through the inter-
vening ape-things

then he remembered the gang-
sters pistol his searching eyes
found it immediately there on the
ground nearly under the feet of the
ape-things as they again shambled
forward to the attack

  blake staked everything upon a
last desperate sortie against the ad-
vancing things with his club whis-
tling around his head in crashing
blows that wrought murderous
havoc in the close-packed hordes he
drove them back for one breathless
moment that gave him time to leap
forward and snatch up the pistol

 the ape-things were already
springing back upon him as he
swung the pistol into line with one
of the jelly-masses he barely
pressed the trigger before the charg-
ing brutes knocked him from his
feet

  as he went down he flung his arms
over his head to protect his face
from the expected attack of those
hooked talons but none came a
body thudded down upon him then
slid limply off again without making
any move to attack blake scrambled
to his feet

  writhing upon the ground all
around him were ape-things in their
death agonies on the ground be-
yond them quivering and broken in
the midst of its dying guards was a
viscid mass of loathsome gray jelly
blakes shot had apparently struck
home squarely in the center of that
zehru of xollar



vulnerable blob even as he watched
the gelatinous mass shuddered in a
last convulsion then became quite
still at the same instant the last sign
of life vanished from the writhing
ape-things on the ground

  a good half of the attacking crea-
tures were included in the dead
bodies the other half blake now
saw had retreated to cluster in wild
panic about the remaining blob of
jelly realizing exultantly that his
single shot had slain one of the two
weirdly disassociated organisms
blake with pistol in hand advanced
toward the other trying to get a
clear shot at the jelly through the
furry bodies clustering around it

the group promptly turned and
fled in blind panic blake sent
the pistols last shot crashing into
the mass without any appreciable ef-
fect then the things stampede car-
ried them hurtling on through one
of the gold-flecked side walls out
into the swirling purple mists

  the gold-flecked sheet flowed to-
gether again so swiftly behind the
things that a fraction of a second
later there was not even the slight-
est indication in its shimmering un-
broken surface to show that it had
ever been pierced

  for thirty yards the fleeing ape-
things sped on into the purple va-
pors then disaster struck them
with bewildering swiftness they
stopped in full flight shuddered for
a moment then slumped to the
ground with their limbs writhing in
agony in their center the jelly
ovoid quivered madly in the same
strange torture

  tiny patches of vivid purple ap-
peared at a hundred different points
upon the dying creatures the
patches spread and merged with
lightning rapidity until a solid sheet
of livid purple covered the writhing
mass swiftly that mass lost both
movement and shape as it melted
down into a pool of turgid purple

slime then the slime vaporized into
purple mists that blended into the
surrounding vapors and all trace of
the ape-things and their jelly nu-
cleus had vanished

  stunned by the incredible speed of
this general dissolution blake real-
ized for the first time the real reason
for the presence of the gold-flecked
walls of force without those shim-
mering walls the captives would not
have lived for a minute in the deadly
purple atmosphere of this weird
world beneath the twin suns the
gold-flecked walls were both their
protection and their prison the
swirling purple mists outside those
walls held the earthlings as effec-
tively and hopelessly prisoners in
their enclosure as gold-fish in a bowl
of water

blake turned back to the
thicket to see how helen and
mapes had fared in that terrific bat-
tle with the headless things he was
relieved to see that the girl had ap-
parently escaped without even a
scratch she was kneeling beside
mapes prone figure doing what she
could to revive him the gangster
was badly battered but he seemed to
have no serious injuries he was al-
ready beginning to stir weakly and
show signs of returning life

  blake started to step over to the
two then he stopped abruptly as he
heard a sharp metallic clang from the
cone-building out in the purple
mists beyond the end wall he
looked quickly up and saw that an
oval window had opened in the
structure near its tip framed in the
opening was what seemed to be a
large concave mirror at one side of
the mirror was a living being of
some kind but the intervening mists
prevented blake from making out
any details beyond a hazy glimpse of
a cluster of what seemed to be long
slender snake-like black tentacles

  the next moment there spurted
from the mirror a broad and swiftly
astounding stories

spreading beam of red light so bril-
liant that it glowed clearly even in
the bright purple rays of the twin
suns before blake could shout a
warning to helen the racing flood of
ruddy radiance was upon them the
scene reeled in a blurred kaleido-
scope of flaming colors before
blakes eyes for a brief second t
complete oblivion swept over

                                      r-

after an interval that seemed
hours consciousness returned
to him as suddenly as it had left him
his first bewildered look around him
disclosed the fact that startling
changes had occurred in his sur-
roundings during the period while
he was under the anesthesia of the
red ray

  his first effort at movement
brought realization that he was in
the grip of a strange paralysis his
head and neck seemed quite normal
in every way but from the throat
downward his body was completely
dead as far as any power of volun-
tary movement was concerned

  he twisted his head stiffly to one
side and saw that helen was stand-
ing there beside him just beyond
her was the motionless figure of gil
mapes both the gangster and the
girl were in the grip of the same
strange paralysis like blake they
were standing there rigidly motion-
less facing the gold-flecked barrier
wall just in front of them

  a moments painful scrutiny of
their position showed blake that the
posts forming the wall of the en-
closure at the end toward the cone
had been brought in nearly a hun-
dred yards toward them while they
slept the shimmering barrier sheet
was now scarcely a yard from their
faces yet they still stood near the
thicket where they had battled the
headless horrors blake saw his coat
half-buried in the blue-gray dust
near his feet where helen had dis-
carded the garment to minister to
mapes

   their unseen captor had obvious-
 ly made definite preparations for
 whatever his next purpose with them
 was to be for a long wheeled plat-
 form had been brought to a position
 opposite them just outside the shim-
 mering gold-flecked sheet blake
 noted the shattered remains of
 mapes pistol on the ground at one
  side of the platform it had appar-
 ently been fished from the enclosure
  and rendered harmless after their
 captor had seen the weapons effi-
 cient use against the headless ape-
 things

   clustered upon the wheeled plat-
 form was an assemblage of intricate-
 ly winding coils glowing tubes and
 other apparatus that conveyed no
 more meaning to blakes bewildered
 gaze than a sight of the interior of a
 metropolitan power-house would to
 a congo savage

 there was only one piece of
 the apparatus regarding whose
 probable function blake could even
 guess this was a pair of long slen-
 der arms that projected through the
 shimmering walls into the enclosure
 supporting at their end a large thin
 metal plate located just over the
 heads of the three earthlings blake
 was willing to wager that it was this
 overhead plate that was responsible
 for the odd paralysis that held them
 helpless

   then a figure came slowly into
 view from where it had been con-
 cealed by the apparatus and blake
 forgot all thought of the strange
 mechanisms as he watched the mon-
 strous thing clamber stiffly from the
 platform and halt squarely in front
 of the captives to stare at them
 through the transparency of the in-
 tervening force sheet

   the thing was a curious blending
 of ihuman and bestial features it
 stood barely five feet in height yet
 its great scale-armored skull was at
 least three times as large as that of
 a grown man there was colossal
zehru of xollar



mental power and nameless evil
glowing in the dark depths of the
two abnormally large eyes that
stared fixedly out from under the
heavy forehead the thing had no
nose the mouth opening sur-
rounded by a rosette of flabby gray
skin was a mere slit the entire
skull and face were covered with
small closely overlapping scales of
lusterless gray

  the head merged directly into a
short black torso nearly as wide as
the skull itself from this trunk
there writhed a score of long black
snake-like tentacles each terminat-
ing in a flexible three-fingered
hand the trunk was supported
by two short thick legs armored
with gray scales and ending in
broad three-toed feet

 greetings earthlings the
voice that emanated from the gro-
tesque mouth was surprisingly reso-
nant in tone allow me to present
myself i am zehru imperial scien-
tist of xollar

the monstrosity seemed amused
at the expressions of blank sur-
prise upon the faces of his captives
i learned your crude language from
your brain cells while you slept un-
der the red ray he explained also
i learned many other things regard-
ing your planet earth i am glad to
find your world so well adapted to
my purpose within a few years
after my arrival there i shall be its
unquestioned ruler

  blake started to voice the many
questions that were surging through
his mind but an imperious gesture
of an outflung tentacle stopped him

  silence earthling there was
tolerant contempt in zehrus ring-
ing voice i will explain some of
the things that puzzle you there is
no reason why i should trouble my-
self to do so yet it may while away
the tedium of the short wait yet re-
maining before my apparatus be-
comes charged to the required point

listen carefully earthling for at
best you will find many of my
thoughts beyond the feeble limits of
the word forms with which you have
provided me

  the world of xollar where you
now are is a planet in the island uni-
verse known to your astronomers as
the great nebula of andromeda
until a short time ago i was one of
its ruling scientists then i sinned
and so grave was my sin according
to the laws of this planet that the
council of three decreed my death
that death sentence upon xollar is
irrevocable and no man has yet es-
caped it no matter where upon the
planet he may be when the appointed
time for his execution comes i was
given the usual period of grace in
which to put my affairs in order in-
stead i have labored unceasingly
here in my laboratory and my labors
have borne fruit i am the first man
in xollarian history to find a means
of escaping the dread death penalty

  briefly i discovered a way by
which i can flee to your far-distant
universe where not even the powers
of the council of three can follow
me that way lies through the door
of inter-dimensional space in space
as you know it the almost unthink-
able distance of a million light years
separates xollar from the dwarf star
you call your sun yet traveling
between space the two planets near-
ly touch each other the same situa-
tion of being near neighbors in inter-
dimensional space holds true with
xollar and at least seven other plan-
ets located in widely separated parts
of your universe

i et me try to illustrate what i

 b j mean by traveling between
space we will assume a nearly two-
dimensional universe in the form of
a circular piece of paper three feet
in diameter there is a dot in the
exact center of each side of this
paper to a two-dimensional crea-
ture forced to travel only on the


astounding stories

surface of the paper the distance be-
tween the two dots can never be less
than thirty-six inches yet by cut-
ting between the two surfaces and
going directly through the paper the
dots are less than one-hundredth of
an inch apart

  such is the case with xollar and
the planets in your universe which
are our immediate neighbors in in-
ter-dimensional space in order to
reach those planets i had only to de-
velop a method of using sufficient
force to cut between the three di-
mensions of intervening space in
solving this problem i developed
both an inter-dimensional net to
bring beings from your universe to
mine and an inter-dimensional gate
to permit beings to pass from here
back to worlds in your galaxy

  you have already seen the work-
ings of the net it was the device of
green fire that brought you here
the use of the net was a vital part
of my plans for without the use of a
physical body from some world in
your universe i could not hope to
live longer than a few minutes after
leaving xollar via the inter-dimen-
sional gate the inherent character-
istics and basic elements of your
galaxy and the andromedan uni-
verse are so different in every way
that an inhabitant of either star-
group cannot exist in the other
xollars purple atmosphere is char-
acteristic of andromedan worlds
your oxygen-saturated air is typical
of worlds in your galaxy just as
xollars purple mists would be im-
mediately fatal to you so would
your clear oxygen-tainted air be
quickly fatal to me

 a ccordingly my only
xx chance of surviving in one of
your worlds is to first transfer my
intelligence to the body of one of
the dwellers upon that planet of
the seven planets within reach of my
net i found only two that promised

to be at all suitable one was your
earth the other a minor planet cir-
cling the star you call vega i
brought both you and a net-load of
vegans here to this oxygen-filled en-
closure i had already prepared

  the vegans were the headless
things with the jelly nuclei i
watched your battle with them and
waited to choose as my vehicle the
planetary type that proved the
stronger you vanquished the ve-
gans so it is in the body of an
earthling that i shall leave xollar
and it is to the planet earth that i
shall be hurtled through the inter-
dimensional gate 

  aside from the slight difficulty
caused by having to keep my body
and yours each in its proper element
during the operation the matter of
transfer into one of your bodies is a
simple one it involves none of the
clumsy brain surgery of your earth-
ly science we of xollar have found
that the real intelligence of a being
is an invisible force not at all de-
pendent for existence upon the pro-
toplasm through which it manifests
my intelligence can function quite
as well in your brain cells as in my
own

  i require no assistant in the
transfer zehru indicated an intri-
cate piece of apparatus on the plat-
form behind him it was a massive
cylinder of fluorescent metal with
two long metallic cables running
from its center each cable ending in
a saucer-shaped disk

t have only to thrust one cable
x through the force-wall into
your enclosure and place its disk
upon one of your heads then place
the other disk upon my own head
the apparatus is entirely automatic
three seconds after both disks are
in place my intelligence will course
into the earthling brain driving out
his intelligence and destroying it as
mine enters
irwnr op xollar -r v -a

  i will of course remove the se-
lected body from under the paralyz-
ing plate before i attach the disks
then when i am safely transferred
to the earthling body i will have
only to walk on through the en-
closure to the silver arch at the far
end and leave xollar forever

  that silver arch is the inter-di-
mensional gate to your earth its
operation is slightly different from
that of the net where the net was
capable of reaching under the sur-
face of your planet a proceeding i
tried when two attempts upon the
surface proved fruitless the gate is
so adjusted that it will place its pas-
senger exactly upon the surface of
your world it requires no coopera-
tion from this end when i step un-
der the arch i merely close a black
lever there inter-dimensional force
immediately catapults me to your
earth then the automatic mecha-
nism of the gate will within half a
minute of my departure release an
explosion that will shatter every-
thing within a radius of a mile here
and so prevent the council of three
from even guessing the method of
my escape

  but what of the two of us whose
bodies you do not need blake pro-
tested can you not at least take
them through the arch-gate with you
back to their home world

 why should i do anything so
foolish as that zehru answered
callously they might easily be a
menace to my first attempts to es-
tablish myself upon your planet far
better to leave them here in their
present state of paralysis to be safe-
ly destroyed in the explosion of the
gate

zehru now thrust three of his
tentacles into a vat of milky
fluid and withdrew them coated
with a silver sheen on the black
flesh the silver glaze seemed to be
an insulation against both the oxy-
gen of the enclosure and the para-

lyzing force of the overhead disk
for the xollarian promptly thrust
the three silver-coated arms through
the wall and began handling the
bodies of mapes and blake in a
painstaking process of examination

  again blake noted that the shim-
mering gold-flecked wall closed
quickly in and kept its surface un-
broken no matter how often objects
were thrust through it

  completely ignoring helen zehru
lifted first mapes then blake his
tentacles probing fingering explor-
ing there was enormous power in
the xollarians grotesque body he
lifted the men as though they were
wooden dolls bringing them close to
the shimmering wall to peer at them
then setting them carefully down
again on their feet under the disk
blake wondered idly why their stiff
bodies did not topple over when
they were left unsupported then de-
cided that the paralyzing force of
the disk probably left the automatic
muscular balancing movements un-
impaired affecting only the powers
of voluntary movement

then as zehru set him down
after one of the periods of ex-
amination blake noticed a new and
startling change the moment his feet
touched the ground his right leg
and right arm were no longer dead

  he hurriedly glanced down at the
ground at his feet and promptly
found what seemed to be the reason
for his partial freedom from the
paralysis in setting his body down
the last time zehru had moved blake
slightly his right foot now rested
upon a corner of the discarded top-
coat lying half buried there in the
blue-gray dust

  the heavily rubberized cloth ap-
parently acted as an insulating sheet
that prevented the effective ground-
ing of the paralyzing force that
streamed down through blakes body
from the overhead disk consequent-
ly all portions of his body between
astounding stories

the coat and the disk were free from
the paralysis for a moment blake
wondered at zehrus carelessness
then he realized that the insulating
qualities of rubber would naturally
be unknown to a xollarian

  noting that zehru was busy at the
moment with his work upon mapes
blake quickly grasped at the faint
chance the presence of the rubber-
ized cloth offered him working
with infinite slowness and caution
he edged his right foot over an inch
at a time dragging the rest of his
body with it

  luck was with him zehru con-
tinued absorbed in his work upon
mapes the xollarians telepathic
powers apparently functioned only
with the aid of the red ray for he
remained oblivious of blakes ac-
tions one final cautious dragging
movement and blakes entire body
was upon the cloth with every mus-
cle again vibrantly alive

                        

blake stood there motionless
faking paralysis while his
brain raced in an effort to figure the
best use to make of his present ad-
vantage he was still trapped not
daring to reach even a hand beyond
the protection of the cloth under-
foot the first essential of any ef-
fort at escape would have to be a
lunge of sufficient power to take him
safely beyond the area of the disks
influence

  blakes first thought was to hurl
himself through the barrier wall
upon zehru trusting to sheer sur-
prise to overwhelm the xollarian
but he quickly dismissed that plan
it left too many elements in zehrus
favor there was a tube-like weapon
thrust in a belt around zehrus mid-
dle and there were probably a dozen
other different weapons lying hand
to his reach among the apparatus on
the platform the deadly purple
mists beyond the wall would alone in
all probability overcome blake be-
fore he could batter zehru down

  by far the best plan was to stage
the battle inside the enclosure where
blake would be in his own native
element if he could yank zehru in-
side the wall he would have him
away from contact with his mechani-
cal weapons and battling in an at-
mosphere inherently poisonous to
him under those circumstances
blake felt that he might have an
even chance in a hand-to-hand com-
bat with the powerful but slow-
footed xollarian

  once zehru was eliminated escape
back to earth should be a simple
matter the silver gate with its auto-
matic mechanism needing only the
closing of a lever was ready and
waiting there in the enclosure be-
hind them

for long tense minutes blake
forccd himself to remain rigidly
motionless while zehru labored over
mapes then finally the xollarian
turned his attention briefly back to
blake and thrust two tentacles in
to grip his body no sooner had the
tentacles crossed above the border of
the cloth than zehru realized that
something was wrong he tried to
whip his arms back again but too
late

  blake made a lightning snatch at
a tentacle with both hands and in
the same lithe movement turned
from the barrier wall and flung him-
self headlong toward the center of
the enclosure zehru had no time to
brace himself he was jerked bodily
through the shimmering wall and on
after blakes lunging body

  one of the xollarians waving ten-
tacles grasped wildly at the over-
head disk in an effort to stay his
flight the only result was to bring
the entire disk and its supports
crashing in ruins to the ground upon
the struggling figures of blake and
himself

  blake was upon his feet again in-
stantly snatching up a yard-long
scrap of metal from the wreckage of
zehru of xollar

the disk he flung himself upon
zehru the xollarian seemed for the
moment too dazed by his fall to fight
back with tentacles raised to guard
his head he staggered backward in
retreat every step taking him far-
ther away from the wall and the pur-
ple mists

  blake was vaguely aware that
helen and mapes freed by the
wrecking of the disk were scram-
bling to their feet mapes was al-
ready running toward the combat-
ants blake was glad at the prospect
of an ally zehrus dazed condition
was swiftly passing he had now
stopped his retreat and was already
fumbling a tentacle toward the tube-
jveapon in his belt

   blake flung himself upon zehru in
another effort to beat him down be-
fore he could draw that weapon but
his metal club glanced harmlessly
off the tentacles zehru raised to
shield his head then beyond zehru
blake saw something that made him
stop his assault

it was mapes sprinting toward
the silver arch-gate at the other
end of the enclosure blakes heart
sank as he realized the gangsters
treachery if he once reached that
arch he could send himself safely
hurtling back to earth while blake
iand helen would be left to perish
with zehru in the explosion that
would immediately follow it was
too late for blake to head the gang-
ster off he had already covered half
the distance to the arch

   zehru noted mapes fleeing figure
almost as quickly as did blake
swiftly the xollarian swung his
tube-weapon into line with the flee-
ing gangster a thin pencil of dull
yellow light of a peculiar density
spurted from the tube toward
mapes there was a flash of blinding
flame as the light beam met the gang-
sters body then mapes figure
seemed to literally explode as
though blasted by dynamite from

 tn

within so devastating was the foree
of that explosion that nothing re-
mained of mapes body beyond a few
scattered fragments of shoes and
clothing

  blake was still dazed at the cata-
clysmic suddenness of mapes death
as zehru swung the tube around to
train it upon him only a last-minute
desperate effort upon blakes part
saved him his wildly thrown metal
club made a lucky hit on the tube it-
self knocking it shattered and use-
less out of zehrus grasp

  unarmed zehru faced blake with
his face contorting in agony for a
moment the xollarian swayed there
apparently trying to gather his fail-
ing strength for the next move the
deadly air of the enclosure was al-
ready taking hideous toll the scaly
flesh of his head and face was dis-
solving like melting butter

  zehrus strength was ebbing too
swiftly for him to have any chance
of gaining safety through either of
the distant side walls his only hope
of fighting back to the purple mists
was to pass blake and go through
the nearby end wall through which
he had originally been drawn

  he came lunging forward in an at-
tack whose sheer fury made blake
give ground before the menace of
the lashing tentacles

blake took another backward
step then staggered as his foot
struck a rough spot in the ground
zehrus tentacles were upon him be-
fore he could recover himself his
club was jerked from his fingers and
sent hurtling far out of reach half
a dozen of the tentacle-arms lashed
around his throat in a strangling
grip

  he clawed wildly at the choking
coils but they failed to loosen even
a fraction of an inch desperately
blake sent his fists smashing into
the gray face the scale armor of
zehrus skull fast weakening in the
liquefying influence of the oxygen

astounding stories

gawe way beneath that battering at-
tack he staggered and his coiling
tentacles relaxed slightly

  blake tore himself free a final
smashing blow with every ounce of
his one hundred and ninety pounds
behind it sent zehru crashing to the
ground the xollarian tried to rise
then feebly slumped back his
strength spent blake leaped for-
ward to finish his opponent but
stopped as he saw that his efforts
were not needed

  the deadly air of the enclosure
was now overwhelming zehru with
swift and hideous death he was lit-
erally rotting before blakes horri-
fied eyes the gray-scaled skin
sloughing off in streaming rivulets
of pallid ooze and the entire body
contorting in what was obviously a
death agony

  sickened vblake stepped back a
pace or twoehrus tentacles feebly
beat the ground around him then
suddenly one of the writhing arms
blundered upon a thin cable run-
ning along the ground before blake
could spring forward to stop him
zehru with a last surge of power
ripped the fragile metal strand com-
pletely in two

  it was the xollarians dying effort
he slumped in a motionless nearly
liquescent heap but that last blind
blow at the earthlings threatened to
be a deadly one the severed cable
led to one of the black posts sur-
rounding the enclosure with the
cables parting an entire section of
one of the gold-flecked barrier walls
vanished xollars deadly purple
mists were already surging in

speed was the earthlings only
chance now helen was as quick
to realize the danger as was blake
side by side they started their mad
race toward where the silver arch-
gate loomed nearly a hundred yards
away

  they had covered barely half the
distance when the air around them

began to show a definite tinge of pur-
ple with the appearance of the pur-
ple hue there came a strange and
swiftly increasing agony a torturing
vibration that seemed to be tearing
every atom in their bodies asunder

  they were within ten yards of the
arch when helen fell blake grabbed
her up in his arms and stumbled on
there was no longer enough oxygen
in the air to even breathe blakes
lungs were on fire every cell in his
body seemed vibrating in unbearable
torment

  it was all that he could do to
struggle up on the low platform he
staggered across the space and un-
der the arch it took the last shred
of strength in his tortured body for
him to lift his hand and pull the
black lever down into place

  its action was instantaneous the
agony of the purple mists was blot-
ted out in a surging wave of mighty
force that swept blake and helen up
and away through a spaceless uni-
verse where black chaos reigned
awesomely supreme there was a
long terrible moment of hurtling
through distances inconceivably
vast blakes brain reeled in nausea

  then suddenly all motion ceased
and everything was normal again
there was firm grassy ground under
his feet and a cool breeze was blow-
ing in his face

  he opened his eyes and saw the
gray half-light of early dawn after
the first swift look around him he
sighed in mighty relief to his left
was the familiar skyline of fifth
avenue to his right was central
park west they were somewhere
in central park safe again in their
own world

  and somewhere in that other
world beneath the twin purple suns
the time mechanism of the silver
gate should even now be releasing
the explosive that would forever
blot out all trace of the evil handi-
work of zehru cosmic fisher of

dear editor

  heres a letter of general discussion of
the many good and few bad features of
astounding stories i am airing the views
and opinions of the small group of science
fiction enthusiasts who form an unorgan-
ized club in this city

  i always scan the readers corner
first and in the october issue i noticed
that several fellow members have upheld
my own ideas which i will heatedly ex-
pound here and now

  why do these horn-rimmed-spectacle-
wearing long-white-beard-stroking bald-
headed toothless examples of censored
let us have peace-ed insist upon tear-
ing every story apart and criticising the
science and possibility

  as one reader asked why do such
people read a s and why does anyone
read a s if you follow the example of
another science fiction mag and stick to
strict science with no human touch then
i will follow the threat of eugene benefiel
and reach for an automatic if we want
history we read such books as h g
wells outline of history if we want
strict science the market is flooded with
excellent text books but-if we want a
mixture of these added to a plot that

makes the reader gasp at its apparent im-
possibility a romance which after all is
the entire human touch and finally well
written thrilling action such as so-and-
so so haughtily trampled in his letter
then we turn to the one and only inimita-
ble astounding stories the true spirit of
a science fiction lover was expressed by
cam costa in your october issue he said
the story is too impossible to believe
but was interesting

  what is this guy wesso trying to do
drag the sacred name of a s down to the
level of the art model mags please be a
little more conservative in picturing
women on your cover not that i object
to practically nude pictures but a s is
just too good for that stuff otherwise i
admire wessos ability to draw lifelike
human forms which is more than paul
can do pauls illustrations are better from
the scientific standpoint but stick to
wesso

  leslie johnsons criticism was one of
the few just ones hereafter all fault
finders should explain why they dont like
such-and-such or keep their traps shut
traps being an ancient earth term for
typewriters as old john hanson would
say-ed

  as for the age-old argument of reprints
i say leave the dead buried dont clutter
 m  astounding stories

vvva   

mp yonr all too few pages with musty has-
beens

   agree with most headers that the mag
should be a semi-monthly and have smooth
edges dont above all alter the size of
a s its perfect one of the readers
cried that you should only allow famous
authors to contribute rot if you dont
give new ones a chance what will you do
when the old ones are gone

  s brights request for a sense of humor
among authors applies to most everyone
but capt s p meek if diffin doesnt
cease ending his brood of the dark
moon at such hair-raising places ill go
crazy the heads of apex was an un-
usual and interesting tale but above all
shines starzls in the orbit of saturn
which is my idea of a perfect science fic-
tion novel-sidney curtiss  argyle
rd la salle 

a voice from england
dear editor

  i feel i must congratulate you on the
success of your august number

  all the stories contain good ideas-
though some way be a trifle far-fetched-
and the scientific substratum underlying
the stories shows deep thought on the part
of the various authors and great selec-
tivity on your own part readers will
gladly excuse all else

  all things considered i like r f
starzls story li the sun died the best
of all

  this author has the gift of introspec-
tion and a crisp brevity and clarity in
expression unsurpassed anywhere he sees
right into the heart-of himself and of
his characters his scientific concepts are
uniformly great and appear very plausi-
ble the way he presents them i do not say
this latter is starzls greatest story for
it is not but it is one more brain-wave
from the scientific mind of a great author

  only this morning i received a letter
from mr n filmer the well-known or-
chestra conductor acclaiming the great
ideas of the american science fiction
magazines-and regretting that we had no
such books over here it may be of inter-
est to mention that he has learned that a
new society has been formed near lewis-
ham s e for the discussion of ideas em-
bodied in the whole field of american
science fiction-wm shore  cum-
berland rd acton w  london

echo-phooey

dear editor

  of course i consider your mag interest-
ing but i would just like one thing im-
proved upon that is the size of the
cover if you could see the curled edges
and the deep furrows in it after the first
three stories are read you would know
why

  why people should want reprints is
more than i can see if they enjoy a cer-

tain story so goeh dam much why dont -
they lay the mag away tip in the attic for
a couple-of months and then take it down
the book not the attic and reread it
why space that could contain a story with
a new plot and new action should be sac-
rificed for a story that we all have read is
beyond my comprehension

  also i would like to say to billy
stechmann that a semi-monthly and a
quarterly are both good things to have
around but that a daily is not necessary
nor is it plausible dont get the idea
that im taking this dumb daily idea seri-
ously and to tell c bessette that his
letter was most rancid and ungrounded
and gave me a pain similar to a neck-
aehe the price being a disgrace and the
covers a disgust phooey

  personally i like all the stories whether
they are based on science or not but when
a sea serpent that has lived in water all
his life can stay on land for two days
while he keeps himself wrapped around a
space ship or when an apes brain fits into
a humans brain cavity it is not so easy to
grasp

  but since i did not think of those things
when i read the respective stories i en-
joyed them immensely

  never mind the restructive criti-
cisms  a s is a good mag but we want a
semi-monthly-robert w blasberg 
centre st nutley n j

you takes your choice

dear editor

  the striking cover illustration of the
november astounding stories - that
macabre skeleton-promised an unusually
interesting issue which it was indeed i
enjoyed all of the stories in that number
a great deal but i wish to comment espe-
cially on the planetoid of peril by
paul ernst

  it seems to me that mr ernst wrote
that yarn with tongue in cheek while the
story was interesting enough on the sur-
face i found it quite amusing as a bur-
lesque on the usual run of science fic-
tion there was the stalwart hero daring
the wrath of the frightful monster single-
handed and finally disposing of it in an
absurdly simple-or simply absurd-man-
ner just as his would-be rescuers arrive
on the scene

  i know that mr ernst can write with
entertaining whimsicality when he chooses
to and i think he was pulling our legs in
the planetoid of peril i may be
wrong but i prefer to consider the story
as a humorous travesty and as such i
enjoyed it immensely-philip diquot

dear editor

  when i read mr carlyle bessettes
letter in the october issue of astounding
stories it led me to believe that mr
 -  r

y-v   - -	v

the readers corner

s

bessette should be publishing science
fiction magazines not criticizing them
in my opinion the text of mr bessettes
letter was very unfair to astounding
stories staff of authors as well as its
editor i am a reader of astounding
stories and i try to be a loyal one if i
did not like the stories published i most
certainly would not buy the magazine

  mr bessette contends that the science
in science fiction stories should be
authentic i wonder if he realizes the
handicap that an author would be working
under if he were to cling closely to scien-
tific fact as proven by experiment he
makes it appear in his letter that this is
what he believes an author should do and
i want to assure mr bessette right here
that if the authors did so i am very
much afraid that science fiction stories
would make rather dry reading

  mr bessette also seems to contend that
drugs which miraculously increase or di-
minish the human form do not so affect
the clothing of objects carried by the
persons being enlarged or diminished i
wonder how many times mr bessette has
experienced this wonderful transforma-
tion surely at least once to possess such
an accurate knowledge of the subject and
again i wonder how many time-cars as
set forth in the exile of time he has
built and found unsuccessful to his accu-
sation that manape the mighty was
trash i protest authors do not draw
good money for writing trash practically
all science fiction authors are persons
possessed of brilliant imaginations and
their work is intended for people with
imaginations

  i would also call the attention of mr
bessette to the fact that in the great
majority of stories published in astound-
ing stories the time of the story is clearly
stated to be hundreds of years hence and
when he shouts impossible in the face
of these dates he is taking in a lot of ter-
ritory-john gervais box  burns

this and that

dear editor

  have just finished the november issue
of astounding stories i think that this
issue is better than the last brood of the
deep moon turned out just as i suspect-
ed it would only i didnt expect doctor
dreiss to get killed hawk carse was
an excellent story and i hope a sequel to
it appears soon

  i was not much disappointed at not
finding a dr bird story in this issue if
saranoff really invented or did all of the
things he is credited with in these stories
he would be the master mind of the
world the planetoid of peril was in
my opinion an ideal story the terror
from the depths was a good commander
hanson story

  now as for reprints i dont think we
would like to have a new story taken out

of the magazine to put in one which we
have probably read many times at least
i read the stories in my magazine over a
couple of times some of these stories
need a couple of readings to enable one to
grasp the full meaning-dale griffith

dear editor

  have just received the november issue
and as i read the readers corner
first i just simply have to answer j b
burnholtz letter you see it happens that
harl vincent is my favorite writer of
science fiction and i want to say right
here that the copper clad world of
his was the best yarn youve ever pub-
lished

  ill agree that the moon weed was
not the best thing of harls that you have
used but judging from the other letters
in the november corner and from the
fact that you as mr burnholtz pointed
out thought enough of it to feature it on
the cover it surely couldnt have been as
bad as our chicago critic claims

  if mr burnholtz is the dyed-in-the-
wool science fiction reader that he
claims to be why does he have so many
pains over being able to trace the idea
back to h g wells had he so desired
he could have traced the idea of every
story in that particular issue of a s
back to h g wells and his remarks on
marvelous rays might apply equally as
well to  of all published science fic-
tion yarns

  there have been some stories in recent
issues that i didnt care for personally
such as the devil crystals of arret
ape-men of xlotli and the recent dr
bird stuff that captain meek has been
turning out but if the editor liked them
some fans will too and i dont have to
read them or yell boloney i dont have
to enjoy every story in the book to get my
moneys worth from a s and when i find
one i consider boloney i pass it up and
take the next one which probably is
boloney to some one else but delightful
relish to me

  if mr b has read so much science fic-
tion he probably wont get much satisfac-
tion out of cummings latest atom stories
for they are very much like his old ones
but new readers of science fiction will
get a great kick out of them-gayl whit-
man  engine house main  nd st

dear editor

  it is not my custom to write to maga-
zine editors should i capitalize that
yes i did it-ed but have always

freatly enjoyed the type of fiction that
ules verne and h g wells pioneered
and as i believe that the best stories of
      this character appear in astounding
stories i make free to heave a few brick-
  bats at some knockers and pat a few of
t  - our authors on the back

         now thats a long sentence but it says
       just what i mean i have read astounding
       stories quite consistently including the
        readers corner and cannot recollect
       ever having seen two such hardboiled
       comments as appeared in the corner of
       the november issue talk about destruc-
       tive criticism

         a communication from carlyle bessette
       states quite without qualification that
       ray cummings beyond the vanishing
       point is the worst ever on the basis that
       the science is impossible and ridiculous
       if i felt that way about it id switch to
       the engineering news record or u s
       meteorological survey reports for amuse-
       ment suppose it is impossible show me
       a science fiction story that hasnt got
       impossible elements and besides its the
       impossibility or seeming impossibility of
       science fiction that makes it fascinating
       especially when it is dressed up with the
       true atmosphere and absorbing story
       values of a master like cummings i liked
       the story

         and then theres a tirade by a jas b
       burnholz who for some obscure reason
       sees fit to jump al over one of our most
       proficient authoi i thought the moon
       weed was very interesting and worth-
       while reading

         then i saw his comments and sort of
       doubting the level of my own mentality
       i dug out the old issue and skimmed
       through the story again i still think its
       pretty good of course the alien weed
       idea is old but so are the ideas of inter-
       planetary travel invisibility robots
       fourth dimension time travel etc wells
       and verne used them long ago but i
       shouldnt say they are worn out by any
       means must we condemn all of our sci-
       ence fiction of to-day as unoriginal
       certainly not nothing under the sun is
       new but a clever author makes it seem
       new by using it in a different way and
       surrounding it with an entirely new set of

circumstances what about rays wells
used them arid about  of our modern
stories use similar devices but shall we
condemn all the modern stories on this
account of course not then why pick
on one particular instance

  i do not make these comments in the
spirit of carping criticism i rate the edi-
tor of a s as about the best in the field
and credit him with enough sabe to choose
only those stories that merit the minimum
classification of good my idea is rate
the authors good better best rather than
bad worse worst like some knockers do
all readers have their individual prefer-
ences all of which may be expected to
vary widely and if we must criticize let
it be in the way of helpful suggestions
rather than in the spirit of animosity-

                             cystex because it is proving a blessing
                             to  many of their customers for in-

naturally fresh

never pare lied never toasted

the cool flavorful freshness of camel ciga-
rettes is purely a natural product

it is attained not by any mysterious proc-
esses but simply by preserving the full natu-
ral goodness of fine sun-ripened tobaccos
these choice tobaccos of which camels are
blended-fine turkish and mild domestic
tobaccos-are never parched or toasted

on the contrary we exercise every care and
precaution to safeguard the natural mois-

ture which is infused with their mildness
and flavor

thats why the camel humidor pack is such
a boon to camel smokers-it could do little
or nothing except for the fact that the ciga-
rettes we put into it are fresh to start with

to see what that means in cool smooth
throat-friendly smoking pleasure switch to
fresh camels for just one day-then leave
them if you can

night except sunday n b c red network

see radio page of local newspaper jor time

dont remove the moisture-proof wrapping from your
package of camels after you open it the camel
humidor pack is protection against perfume and
powder odors dust and germs in offices and homes
even in the dry atmosphere of artificial heat the
camei humidor pack delivers fresh camels and
keeps them right until the last one has been smoked
