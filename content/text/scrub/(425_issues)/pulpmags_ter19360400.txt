no is arthur leo zagat

o	be in character i presume i
should be a weazened ancient
stooped and long-bearded and wild-
eyed robed in black i should pen weird
tales of terror and despair by the mid-
night luminance of a wick woven from a
murdered maidens hair molded in a
candle pressed from the fat of long-dead
cadavers a bat should soar on silent
wings about my head and an owl perched
on my shoulder should hoot each time i
lay down my quill to quaff a gory draught
from a grinning skull

  unfortunately i am not like that children
do not run shrieking from the sight of my grisly
visage of my eyes of evil dogs do not howl as
i prowl lightless graveyards on silent ghoulish
feet

  i am really quite human   

  my scribbhngs first saw print in new yorks
city college i was-of all things-the con-
ductor of a humorous column in the weekly
yes that humor was weird and horror crept
into my life there too horror i wrote verse
for the literary monthly i

  then the world war i became buck private
in a hush hush outfit in france i am not per-
mitted even now to tell the nature of what we
did but there are certain age-slimed subter-
ranean tunnels in that strife-torn land certain
groves ringed around by gloomy arborage-
no perhaps you may decipher in my tales like
kernels in thick nutshells of fiction the incred-
ible things i saw

  the captains and the kings departed but i
stayed on immersing myself in the lore of an-
cient mysteries at the university of bordeaux
home at last marriage a degree in law at
fordham university business drygoods drugs
the advent of a daughter

  and the depression

  came the grey dawn of a day when there
was exactly two dollars and forty-one cents
between the zagat family and starvation no
job nothing try something try anything
but what

  you used to write pretty well the wife
keeping a stiff upper lip  hear the magazines
pay for stories theres paper around and pen-
cils and i can borrow a typewriter

  the story sold and the next one and the
next   

  new york suddenly became a mine of ma-
terial a microcosmos of the world i heard
whispered hints of voodooism in harlem of
werewolves in the east side fifties of vam-
pires in german yorkville of fox-women in
oriental pell street they were all are still all
grist to my mill in brooding veiled eyes i read
the mysteries i bring to you from halting lips

continued from page 

 in uncouth accents the fotktajes of an elder
 world drip slowly one by one and eme by one i
 pass on to yon the chili prickles that scamper
 my spine as i hear them the bristling neck-hairs
 of ancestral fear

   how much of truth is there in these ancient
 myths  frankly i do not know but i do know
 that those who tell me of them believe in them
 utterly i know by the dread in their eyes by
 the grey film o fear that underlies the brown
 or yellow or swarthy tan of their alien counte-
 nances for the moment at least i share that
 dread that fear 

   once not long ago i saw death i taw him
stalk-a misty shimmer of grey half-seen dra-
peries--down a long dim hospital ward i
saw the deep dark sockets in his skull where
there were no eyes search the rows of white
moaning beds-for me i saw his bony hand
reach out to take me   

   but minutes before my bed had been ex-
changed for that of another across the aisle
and so it was another whom death took it was
anothers corpse about which the nurses drew
the white screens that have one meaning only
in a hospital ward

   i wonder if death has yet discovered his mis-
 take when he does will he come for me-to-
 night perhaps  is that scraping i hear really
 a mouse gnawing in the wall or the rasp 
 deaths skeleton fingers on my door panel   

or have i been stricken off deaths books

priestess of murder

  bij arthur leo zaat

author of death lives at our house etc

a thing of terror lurked in hiding-waiting to work
its ghastly evil upon beautiful leila monroy  was
lover in truth the monster who- sought herf was
it lovely eve her best friend or were leilas
darkest suspicions correct-could it be that she
herself changed periodically into the thing
of horror and death that haunted that stricken
countryside
the house was full of whispers
leila monroy pathetically small in
the huge wing-aided easy chair
fumbled at her throat a sob was trying
to rise there knotting her muscles with a
sort of physical pain

  the house was full of whispers the

ancient farmhouse that always had been
her home was an abode of brooding dread
a place of dark despair the groaning of
the old timbers drying fibers seemed ter-
ribly loud in the oppressive silence they
came from the very walls about leila
from the age-darkened rafters overhead
from the ominous gloom of the entrance
hallway that somehow repelled the living-
room light from the broad staircase

a daringly different long novel
of eerie mystery and weird
unholy passion




terror tales

twisting upward out of that foyer to ap-
pallingly empty obscurity above

  the house was full of whispers shred-
ding leilas frayed nerves with terrible
reminders of her days long agony just
such a place of muted ominous sounds
had the courtroom been unshed tears
through the anguished hours had blurred
its crowded benches and the only reality
had been the gaunt suffering figure of her
grey-faced father in the prisoners dock
but the whispers had been inescapable
all day they had hissed at her as they
were hissing now mutterings of horror
as witness after witness had damned jus-
tin monroy with husked tales of brutal
unutterably savage killing gasps of out-
rage when leila herself gave halting testi-
mony that she had been with her father
here in this room all the fatal hour be-
tween the time when shean rourke had
last been seen alive and the time when
foster corbett had found his hacked and
mangled corpse beneath the poplars divid-
ing the two farms

  whispers had met the exhausted girl-
whispers of tight-lipped condemnation-
when at last she had stumbled down from
the witness chair and the farmer-womens
sunday silks had rustled self-righteously
drawing away from the defiling touch of
the girl who hostile eyes said had lied
desperately to save a blood-guilty slayer

  whispers whispers whispers-seething
out of the pulsating silence as the stony-
faced jury marched back into their box

  and then the whispers had become a
soundless scream searing leilas breast
as the dreadful verdict soughed from the
foremans tight throat

  murder while insane

  insane the recollection flung leila
monroy up out of her chair held her
rigid in distress insane the word hissed
within her skull hissed from the stark
vacancy in which she was so utterly alone
with terror and despair slithering foli-

age stirred by a swiftly rising wind hissed
it at her from the terrible outer night
insane

  insane the kindly tender old man to
whose gnarled hand she had clung as the
brown clods thudded on the drab wood of
her mothers coffin the hard-working
weatherbeaten oldster who had been fath-
er and mother to her through so many
years-a madman her father from
whose veins came the blood surging now
so darkly in her veins

  leila quivered tremors ran through
the long delicate curves of her slim form
the tiny oval of her small-featured coun-
tenance blanched with a new dismay his
blood in her veins what if that blood
were tainted with a foul lust to kill with
an stavistic urge to tear with fang and
claw to rend human flesh and taste the
warm salt-sweet tang of human life-fluid
on smacking gory lips what if she had
not really drowsed that half-hour whose
lapse fatally had invalidated her testi-
mony had she run instead ravening
by his side while a fearful heritage of
homicidal madness blotted memory from
her soul as the alienists said it had blot-
ted recollection from justin monroys

a bruptly the light within was paled
by a blue blaze glaring in through the
window on which her unseeing stare was
fixed by lightning that split the skys
black vault with a jagged and blazing frac-
ture thunder blast became to the shocked
girl the devastating roar of an enormous
beast that leaped on the house that bat-
tered it that shook it in huge jaws whose
slaver was driving rain storm tumult
howled about the old walls crashed
through the empty rooms drowned out
the whispers that had tortured leila
drowned out the whispers in her harried
brain almost after the first terrific on-
slaught she was grateful for the fury
priestess of murder



that would no longer let her hear those
whispers

  but it could not drown her dreadful
thoughts

  no she moaned merciful lord
no as she had moaned when justin
monroys suave attorney had elicited from
the bald-pated alienist glib testimony that
had saved his client from the death-chair
-and condemned him to a living hell
no it cant be true

  i could have done nothing else the
lawyer had answered her reproaches af-
terward it was your fathers ax foster
corbett found buried in the dead mans
chest your fathers footprints were
traced oat of the trampled mess around
the corpse and across the meadow to your
back porch there was the old boundary
line feud between your father and his
neighbor his threats that if foster corbett
or his son stanley or his farm hand
shean rourke stepped on monroy land
they wotrid regret it against that we had
only your word that he was seated in the
room with you all evening and on cross-
examination you admitted that you had
fallen asleep

  the wind pounded against the door as
their fists had pounded coming to accuse
dad of the awful deed foster corbett
triumphant at last over his ancient ad-
versary stan corbett-

  leilas pale lips writhed stan in his
arms she had known happiness against
her lips his lips had thrilled defiant of
the enmity between their fathers they had
loved if state trooper stanley corbett
had fired his gun into her heart he could
no more cruelly have slain that love than
he had by saying to her father youre
under arrest mr monroy

  rain lashed against the window in a
spasm of new fury the world was ablaze
with a flickering electric flare that spilled
bluely on the tossing poplars marching
along the tree-marked boundary between

the two farms it was just there that
shean rourkes corpse- something
moved stealthily-vague and black-
among the wind-bent trunks

  darkness smashed down again who
was it who prowled the storm-drenched
night the demoniac slayer who had made
a ghastly horror of what once had been
a man the real killer stalking a new
prey stalking her icy fingers clutched
leila monroys throat chill prickles
tickled her spine hi blood-thirst still
unslaked inflamed by his terrible crime
for which dad unjustly had been con-
demned to terrible expiation the murderer
was creeping up on her on her

  an ancient legend of whispered terror
trailed a slimy speculation across her fear
a name breathed with shudders of appre-
hension by the gaffers clustering around
the cherry-bellied stove in the village the
monster of west cliff the traditional
phantom that was reputed to haunt the
stony precipice whose sheer rampart rose
behind the fertile plain along which from
north to south lay the three neighboring
farms of the corbetts the monroyg and
the stars often of late he had been
seen stalking the dark belt of primeval
forest cloaking the base of that cliff the
elusive appalling wraith it was said of
an indian chief whose tribe had been
massacred by the plains first settlers
stalking the ages waiting for a chance
at gruesome revenge every accident
every unexplained disaster of the country-
side was ascribed to him was it he who-

qtorm-blaze arched the heavens
once more exploding into momentary
existence the tempest-tormented trees the
downpour-beaten pasture between they
were deserted vacant as the house itself
nothing-no one was anywhere in sight
the prowling shadow had been an illu-
sion a figment of her anguished brain

  wait wait the imagined sight had


terror tales

recalled something to leila an incident
of the fateful night that she had utterly
forgotten till now till it was too late the
girl groaned beat her breast in bitter self-
condemnation

  stepping to this very window that eve-
ning to pull down its shade she had seen
or thought she had seen foster corbett
dodging behind the tool shed just visible
left of the house she had said nothing
to her father fearing to excite him fear-
ing to jeopardize the reconciliation for
which she and stan plotted the terrible
events following had obliterated the mat-
ter from her memory utterly till now
how could she have forgotten it its
astounding implication the murder-axe
whose blood-smeared helve had shown no
fingerprints had come from that very
shed

  perhaps it was not yet too late per-
haps if she told her story-

  shrill sound sliced across the thought
it stopped spurted again rrrring-
rrrring-rrring it whirled leila around
to it rrrring-rrring-rrring the tele-
phone three rings the monroy signal
who could be phoning her stan in-
credible eve starr perhaps eve her
neighbor and closest female friend calling
to extend sympathy consolation like eve
to remain loyal when every one else
shunned her

  rrrring-rrring- leila flinging across
the room into the hallways dimness
jerked the receiver from its hook

  hello

  lock your doors a hoarse unrecog-
nizable voice grated without preamble
lock your windows a voice choked
coarsened by some inexplicable terror
dont let any one in not any-

  the telephone was suddenly dead with
the flat inanimate deadness of a line from
which the humming life of its current has
gone dead had the storm blown down

a frail wire or had some human hand cut
it some human hand just too late to
stop the husked warning

  some human hand icy terror ones
more struck at leila monroy the hand
of some one who even now crept up on
the house then she was moving had
flung herself to the great front door was
thrusting into its socket the heavy bolt
clamped to its sturdy oak

  the back door was already locked she
remembered the windows old-fash-
ioned shutters creaked out of recesses in
their embrasured sides to the frantic pull
of her trembling hands were also bolted
she rushed in frenzied haste through din-
ing room through kitchen clicking on
light as she went light from which shad-
ows fled that were black sinister silhou-
ettes waiting around corners behind
doors to spring upon her the lower
floor was at last a blaze of light was a
locked and barred fortress against what-
ever menace threatened the lower floor-

  but there was the upstairs yet the up-
stairs that was blacker as leilas dilated
pupils stared up into its mystery because
of the luminescence about her no longer
was it the warm familiar bedroom floor of
the old house but a precinct of stygian
gloom haunted by some darkness-shrouded
threat

  the girls small fingers tightened on
the newel post to which she clung tight-
ened till the blood was driven from them
and they were grey trembling splotches
against the lustrous patina of the wood
it was only the dark up there of which
she was afraid over and over she told
it to herself it was only because of the
dark that she had that hint of evil lurking
just beyond the stairhead of monstrous
evil crouched just beyond the range of
her vision haunched and waiting to pounce
upon her there was nothing more in
the corridor above leila assured herself
than shadows like the eerie phantoms that
priestess of murder



had fled from the lights she had turned
on

  nothing a shriek sliced down to her
the high shrill scream of a woman in
deadly terror

  it checked off faded into vague thump-
ings as of a fierce struggle into the thud
of a storm-tossed branch against the build-
ing wall it came again

nniny muscles twitched in leilas
cheeks insensate humorless laughter
sounded in her fluttering throat it was
the wind that had screamed from up there
tightening her scalp with fear it must
have been the wind no one could pos-
sibly be up there

  but she was afraid afraid to go up
there and look afraid of the storm and
the dark

  a sharp crackle jerked her around
she stared wide-eyed at the entrance door
fool that had been only the splintering
of a gale-riven branch- it came again
unmistakable this time the crunch of
a heel on the gravel pathway outside

  a foot thudded on the porch just be-
yond the door and unseen fingers rattled
the door knob through a crashing peal
of thunder the terrified girl heard a threat-
ening hoarse bellow someone was just
the other side of the sturdy portal some
one- the killer  the mad killer seeking
her

  he bellowed again pounded wild fists
on the wood the great panel shuddered
under the berserk attack its hinges
creaked the furious pounding piled a
frenzied terror on her fear of the storm
and the dark realization pierced her
that only five feet of air two indies of
wood separated her from the monstrous
creature that had made of shean rourke
a mangled horror it twisted her about
sent her hurtling headlong up the stairs
that a moment before dread had barred
to her sent her dashing through the light-

less corridor in instinctive flight to the
fancied sanctuary of her own bedroom

  her hand clutched the knob of its door
swung her to it franctically she thrust
open the panel slammed it shut behind
her leaned back against it gasping quiv-
ering

  rain lashed against the window pane
threshed on the roof above her dulled
by distance the savage pounding on the
door below beat about leila as though
tangible blows buffeted her momentarily
the lightning had ceased the chamber
was obliterated by tar-barrel darkness a
feeling grew on leila that she was not
alone here

  leila monroy whimpered stabbed blind-
ly at the light-switch she knew jutted from
the wall to her right the small room
sprang into sight a dishevelled appari-
tion stared at her from her dresser mir-
ror russet wealth of hair tumbling about
her now pallid face mouth twisting and
livid grey eyes dark with the frenzy of
her terror she pulled her gaze from it
saw the bed-

  crumpled on its scarlet-flecked counter-
pane lay the contorted body of a girl
blue-black hair veiled her face but where
a pink frock had been cruelly torn away
lurid fingermarks on a white throat
showed the manner of her death her
death-there was no motion no movement
at all in the awful stillness of the pathetic
figure the exposed blanched breast
stirred with not the slightest breath

  eve leila whimpered unable to do
no more than stare and whimper
eve 

  forgotten the tumult of the storm the
battering at the entrance door forgotten
everything but the horror that burst with-
in her skull but she had no memory of
eves arrival no memory   

  time must have dropped out of her
consciousness time enough for her to


terror tales

have summoned the girl to have lured
her up here time enough-for her own
hands to have clenched on her friends
throat to have pressed pressed until life
no longer throbbed beneath her throttling
fingers

chapter two

the phantom in the trees

tt seemed to leila monroy that she

  could feel in her icy palms memory
of the soft fleshs slow crumple beneath
their lethal construction once she had
hated eve when the girl quite openly had
tried to win stan corbett away from
her that jealous hatred had passed away
with her own triumph and they had been
friends again had it passed had it not
rather sprung to sinister existence with the
blood madness inherited from the father
they had led away to a padded cell

  darkness smashed down as the light
went out the window was momentarily
a blue oblong flickering with the electric
radiance of lightning

  leila a voice came up to her open
up its stan leila stan i

  stan he had come for her as he had
come for her father he had come to
drag her shrieking to the same chamber
of horrors where justin moore had agon-
ized

  he would have to catch her first if
she were mad she would avail herself of
a lunatics cunning from a window at
the end of the passage rain-spout clamps
made an easy ladder to the ground the
storm would hide her she would bury
herself in the woods- leila got the
door open behind her flung out into the
hall

  thunderous crash of the portal below
met her and the tempests howl blasting
in through the house the sound whirled

her startled glance in its direction the
stairs were in darkness

  stans feet thudded on the steps com-
ing up

  lightning glimmer threw stans climb-
ing shadow against the wall made visible
the face of a crouching figure it was
the grizzled distorted face of foster cor-
bett  of stans own father waiting for
his son with a revolver uplifted in his
hand

  stan leila screamed look out
hes-

  a shout drowned her out a blast of
bestial fury somewhere a shot blazed
and then the world crashed in on her she
fell headlong into a limbo of whirling
coruscating sparks she felt herself lifted
in powerful arms felt herself thrown over
a heaving shoulder shouts shots echoed
about her a gibbering chatter of apelike
defiance rain drenched her an icy gale
pounded at her oblivion claimed her

at last leila dared to lift her lids
bit by slow bit she blinked dark-
ness was about her strangely mottled
with glancing fragments of silvery light
darkness and glistening dank rock above
her the earthy smell of a tomb in her
nostrils

  she was it dawned on her in a shallow
cave the luminous flecks dancing about
her were splotches of moonlight shifting
through the leaves of high trees a cave
trees this must be west cliff then

  leila thrust herself up to a sitting pos-
ture as terror sliced her was this the cave
of the monster but there wasnt any
monster she thought there was only
the crazed slayer who had hacked shean
rourke with an ax who had throttled
eve starr who had crouched with lethal
gun to shoot down stan corbett not
any phantom monster not justin mon-

roy either nor leila herself foster
corbett

  for a moment leila forgot her pain
her danger in the jubilance of that revela-
tion dad was no maniac killer nor was
she it was foster corbett who had
schemed with the cunning of the insane to
slay and place the blame for his crime on
the man he hated foster corbett who
had dragged a second victim to leila mon-
roys bed so that the daughter should be
doomed to the same terrible fate to which
he had condemned the father foster cor-
bett who losing all hold -on reason had
haunched in the storm-battered corridor
waiting to kill his own son

  had he had he added filicide to the
role of his crimes a shot had blazed
across her scream of warning just before
the madman had whirled to attack her

if stan had fired ed tit tmaniac could not
have moved so sw sdjftllt had been fired
at stan then h h h ied itself in his

  then she froze as a rattle of rolling
pebbles came up to her from below the
cavern mouth of stones dislodged by
some one chmbing the face of the cliff

  he was coming for her he had borne
her here left her here while he pursued
some other dreadful mission of his mur-

terror tales

  helpless leila monroys lip snarled
up from her tiny teeth she was suddenly
a creature of the wilds the desperate
courage of hopelessness entered into her
the feral cunning of wildernesss small
beasts who will fight must fight when
escape from their persecutors has become
no longer possible she stooped snatched
handfuls of jagged stones from the cave
floor flitted to its entrance silent as a
cloud

t eila peered out and down slyly cau-
tious there he was like a huge
black spider clinging to the splattered bare
precipice working his way up indomita-
bly slowly by the necessity of finding
handholds footholds in the bare sheer
rock face hidden now by a pool of
stygian shadow revealed now by frag-
ments of leaf-splintered moonlight in-
exorably climbing to add her to the dread-
ful list of his victims

  distorted by the eerie light he was
somehow unhuman somehow a monster
of primitive evil spewed out of the past
and leila monroy the weak thing he
hunted was primitive too primitive and
pitiless her hand flew back arced for-
ward a stone left it-and struck fair on
the skull of the maniac the crunch of
its landing came up to her sickened her
but she flung another stone and another
a dark splotch appeared on his forehead
and then the man let go his holds plunged
down a black sprawling figure crashed
terribly in the underbrush below

  a thrill of triumph ran through leila
a hot thrill of triumph that was a torrid
flame boiling in her blood her laugh
bubbled up in the dark silence of the for-
est a shrill thin cacchination of black
laughter spilling from her gaping throat
rioting out in the rain-washed night

  it was horrifying her throat clamped

on it she checked it icy with loathing
of the savagery that had inspired it quiv-
ering with revulsion at the thing she had
become she had killed a man and laughed
with joy at the deed she leila monroy
cliff and forest whirled about her in a
sudden vertigo the hot flush of joy at
corbetts thumping fall the jubilant
laughter were these the reactions of san-
ity  soaring glee at killing-only a luna-
tic could feel it only a homicidal maniac

  murder while insane what if the
incredible acts she had ascribed to foster
corbett were fetid illusions of her own
darkened mind what if she were in-
deed the lunatic slayer and he a good
neighbor trying to save her from herself
the victim of her mania what if her
hand that had slain him was gory already
with the blood of eve starr and of stan

  no not stan that at least was
clear to her even in her bewilderment if
stan were slain she could not have slain
him there was the test only a madman
would kill his own son corbett or she
she or corbett if stan were alive she
was the maniac if he were dead-

  if he were dead-the thought slashed at
her like a sword that she should hope
for his death-her stan broad-shoul-
dered upstanding frank-eyed no rath-
er that she be condemned to the eternal
perdition of raving madness rather that
she take a knife and slice it across her
own throat    bullets do not always
kill was he lying there wounded des-
perately wounded suffering not dead
but bleeding to death while she dallied
here delaying the aid that might save him 

  leila licked dry lips with a trembling
tongue she was down on her knees on
the narrow ledge that made a sort of
porch to the cave she swung over it
was scrambling for footing against the
sheer wall of the rock was inching down
that perilous descent while weakness was
priestess of murder



like water in her limbs while pain was a
network of agony meshing her frail form

  stanl-

  his name was a prayer on her lips as
she attained the cliffs foot at last as she
sent one shuddering glance at the still
mound blacker against black that her
missies had flung there stan i

  she plunged into the thicket

a twisted root caught leilas foot
pounded her headlong into the mire
she lay as she fell heaving in great
breaths of the dank air to her tortured
lungs fighting for strength to rise to go
on the forest silence closed in on her a
black pall of soundlessness

  not altogether soundless a vague
ominous slither threaded it it lifted lei-
las head with a jerk despite the darts of
agony shooting through her at even that
slight effort it pulled her burning stare
through the tree-boles that were grotesque
giants reaching writhing arms down to
pluck her from her miry bed

  and then her scalp suddenly tightened

  it drifted almost silently toward her
wraithlike phantasmal  a vagrant
beam caught it full-and a scream formed
in leilas breast tore her constricted
throat died at her lips

  the phantom of eve starr was gliding
toward her between the ebon trees eve
starr whose corpse leila had seen con-
torted in awful death on the gore-stained
counterpane of her own bed

chapter three

a dreamland of dread

t eila monroys blood jelled with-
in her veins supernal terror
squeezed her heart as the apparitions
ghastly approach held her eyes with the
appalled but helpless stare of a reptile-
jfudnated bird

  and a twig snapped beneath eve starrs
feet

  the sharp crackle of dried wood break-
ing beneath the pressure of a careless foot
so little a thing to save one from blither-
ing madness it forced reason into leilas
shuddering terror stung her to sanity with
the realization that this was not a disem-
bodied ghost advancing toward her
through the obscurity of the fear-filled
wood that it was flesh and blood that it
was-

  eve leila moaned finding strength
somehow to stand up eve

  startled the dusky-haired girl swung
around to her fright distorting her blood-
less countenance

  whos there she gasped who is
it  her eyes were bumed-out coals dark
horror pitting the blanched whiteness of
her visage who-

  its leila hon leila monroy
leila stark terror in that gusted ex-
clamation leila

  her hand went up to her throat-to the
blue bruises that splotched its whiteness
the marks of throttling fingers of whose
fingers  leila monroy knew that she must
ask the terrible question though she was
terrified of what the answer might be

  eve she blurted eve who did
that to you who was it i was it i
eve

  leila eve hadnt heard her dont
touch me or had she heard and was
this the awful answer to the momentous
question keep away

  the girl whirled dashed away

  started to dash away she stumbled
went to her knees snatched for support
at the rattling withes of a low bush
swayed there in pitiful weakness she was
feeble so feeble the cold and the damp
of the woods would kill her before morn-
ing if she were left here alone

  eve leila said not moving not dar-
ing to move i wont hurt you ai-


terror talbs

most without volition her arms went out
appealing to her friend let me help
you let awe kelp you get- home

  eves fcree hand fumbled at tire grisly
marks above the pallid round of her volup-
tuous breasts as though the very sight of
leila reawakened their agony

  nfc she whimpered havent you
done enough to me already

  she pufied herself ie her feet staggef-
ingiy painfully started to fall again

  leila jumped forward to catch her ewe
screamed somehow found footing lurched
away from her grasp ldk stopped tried
again

  listen to me eve i may have--i may
have been mad before but im sane now
youll have to believe that im sane be-
cause you cant get home alone you cant
youfl die out here in the woods please
believe me please let me help you and
all the time and inner voice was saying
if she dies you have killed her

  help me eves husked tones were
bitter accusing you help me mur-
deress

  she screamed that last expletive and
then she had whirled and was running
stumbling dazedly impelled only by the
false strength of a terrible fear

  eve she couldnt last long eve
she would drop far in the tangled depths
of the woods eve leila reeled after
her

o	trangely enough eve managed to
keep just ahead of her just beyond
reach she was a flitting staggering form
just ahead of leila always just ahead
always just about to drop but somehow
keeping on her feet somehow maintain-
ing a little space between them the rea-
son for her chase slid away from leila
she knew only that she must catch the
luminous wraith she pursued knew only
that she must keep going through the
nightmare blackness of the impeding for-

est knew only that the uncanny compul-
sion was upon her-

  a denser grouping of stygian tree-
trunks swallowed eve for an instant leila
plunged through them-stopped eve had
disappeared she wasnt anywhere in
sight and there was no sound to tell where
she had gone

  had she after been pursuing a phan-
tom created by her own mad brain  was
she doomed forever to wander in a dream-
land of dread in which she would be un-
able to distinguish the real from the un-
real doomed forever-see these very
trees seemed instinct with a baleful life
they semed to be closing in on her

  one of them was moving was coming
toward her with a slow infinitely evil de-
liberation it couldnt be moving she
was imagining it how could a tree move 

  it wasnt a tree it was a bent massive
figure of a man huge browless head set
neckless cm gargauntuan shoulders
bronzed naked torso gleaming eerily in
the moonlight little pig-like eyes glow-
ing redly out of an imbecilic drooling
countenance it was the monster of the
cliff

  but she had killed the monster no
fhat was foster corbett she had killed
this monster didnt exist it was a fig-
ment of her imagination this bestial tiling
that crept inexorably toward her it
wasnt there at all and she wouldnt
run from it if she didnt run from it it
would vanish and she would be sane again
she must not be afraid of it she must
not be afraid of the big-muscled arms that
seemed to reach out for her of the stubbed
and fearful talons

  that closed on her arms with a sud-
den fearful pain that told her the thing
was real that told her too late that it
was real

  leila screamed but the shrill cry of her
terror and her agony was drowned by the
ferocious overwhelming roar of the mon-
priestess of murder



ster towering over her he slammed her
against the shaggy unyielding bark of a
giant tree behind her trying to crush her
it seemed into the very heart of the quiv-
ering timber driving breath from her so
that she could scream no longer

  she could not scream but she could
flail desperate fists against the steel-hard
thews of his giant arms the beast laughed
at her puny efforts-chatteringly gibber-
ingly his black-lipped mouth opened to
display yellow rotted fangs a cavity in
which the flesh was not red but a hideous
black

  leila writhed jerked free almost
jerked free the monsters knee came
up thrust excruciatingly into the softness
of her abdomen pinned her helpless
against the rough tree-bark behind that
cut through her flimsy dress and stabbed
her with countless tiny points pinned her
helpless so that one of his bestial paws
released its grip and flew to the neckline
of her frock it tore downward as the
seamed hairless countenance mowed with
insensate obscene glee

  pretty the thing chattered pretty
and his leathery palm fumbled at leilas
breast rasped it with a lewd caress cal-
ban likes

rphe girls hand spatted against the in-
durated cheek her toes banged at the
monsters shins he squealed like a stuck
pig and his fingers flew to her throat
clutched it constricted

  leilas lungs pumped unavailingly fight-
ing for air they could not find the brutal
digits tightened still more till the girl
thought they must cut right through the
flesh must squeeze clear through her
neck knives stabbed and twisted within
her chest invisible fingers gouged at her
eyes the glaring ferocious visage of
her tormentor vanished in a great roaring
blackness

  through which she seemed to hear a

high piercing whistle the roaring in her
skull was drowned in the blast of cal-
bans feral roar the whistle came again
and leila crashed to the ground as the
terrible grip on her throat the pinning
thrust of the bestial knee were released

  leila wallowed in her distress while
somewhere above her a tumultuous sound
crashed momentarily and died away she
pulled air into the sore agony of her
lungs

  leila stan cried somewhere above
her

  it wasnt stan it couldnt be stan
stan was lying dead in the old house that
had suddenly become an abode of horror
stan had bled to death there because she
had not been able to get to him in time to
save him

  leila darling

  hands were tugging at her were roll-
ing her over stans hands his dear
face was looking down at her anxiety
clouding his eyes stans face   

  leila speak to me leila i

  the girl sat up he was dishevelled
his troopers uniform was gashed torn
by the tearing brambles of the forest
and there was a livid weal across his
tanned cheek that a lashing tendril had
made but he was alive it was stan who
had saved her at the last possible moment
from an awful death

  stan what-how did you get here
how    

  i was knocked out there in your
house i came to heard the back door
close i rushed out there and saw you
vanishing into the woods ive been hunt-
ing for you   

  then wasnt

  dont talk now stan silenced her
youre hurt exhausted when i get you
home get you warm you can tell me all
about it

  he was tender solicitous he loved her
tall leila nestled in his arms thrilling


terror tales

to his strength thrilling to the fed of his
heart beating against her own she would
obey him she would keep quiet for a few
minutes if she started to talk if she told
him that it had been eve he had seen
not her she would have to tell him the
rest

  she would have to tell him that the
girl in his arms had killed his father how
could she tell him that how could she

  tiie black trees of the forest slid by
rustling in the night leila whimpered
hush darling stan murmured well
soon be out of this well soon be where
its warm and light

  light would there ever be light again
in her dark soul darker than ever now
thought burred through leilas aching
brain stan had been attacked in the
house had been knocked unconscious
that was evident foster corbett must
have done that lying in ambush then
leila must be sanfc

  but eve starrs actions had confirmed
the awful speculation that it was leila
who had attacked her leila in whose
mind no memory remained of the terri-
ble deed that proved her insane

  there wasnt any answer there could-
nt be any answer because she didnt
know how much of her experiences was
real how much she had forgotten how
much she had imagined the monster
for instance stans coming had saved
her from him but stan didnt seem to
know anything about him had that
lecherous attack been only her own mad-
ness had her own maniac fingers tom
the clothes from her shoulders clamped
tightening about her own throat

  or had stans call his threshing
approach frightened the brute away be-
fore the trooper could see him 

  over stans shoulder leila saw a
shadow move high up on the bough of a
tree it haunched came sprawling down

great arms flailing spread spatuiate
talons clawing for stans throat

chapter four

master of the monster

ctan leila monroy shrieked and
contorted in his arms driving her
forehead against his chest this instan-
taneous inspiration of her terror was the
only thing that could have saved her
lover it unbalanced him sent him reeling
backward and the downdropping mon-
ster missed his mark

  the brute crashed down into the under-
brush was momentarily tangled in the
whipping leaves in that instant leila
slipped from stans hold as the trooper
recovered his footing and reached for his
holstered gun calban bellowed soared
from the ground his shaggy arm lashed
ahead of him with a cobras lightning-
like lash struck stans gun-wrist pound-
ed the weapon from it its metallic gleam
sliced into the underbrush and the antag-
onists came together with a thud of flesh
against fleh that was thunderous to the
terrified girl

  stans fists pumped two flashing pis-
tons into calbans taut belly the mon-
sterv muscle-bulging arms clamped
around the trooper in a rib-cracking
clinch they swayed black and gigantic
in the eerie forest light and from the taut
straining agony of that clinch burst an
appalling cacaphony of bestial sounds
of growls and vicious snarls

  a shrill piercing squeal forced by in-
endurable pain from a strong mans lips
galvanized leila into action she dropped
to her knees searching frantically in the
meshed baffling underbrush for stans
gun the tumult of that eerie battle in-
creased behind her a chattering mind-
less scream signalled that stan had got
home a telling blow
priestess of murder



  run leila the man yelled get
away i cant-hold him

  the girl twisted saw calban momen-
tarily driven away from stan closing in
again her lover met the renewed attack
by a ferocious uppercut exploding from
a crouch his fist landed on the monsters
jaw with the blast of a rifle shot his other
fist crashed against the brutes chest the
devastating blows might have been flicks
of a flys wings for all the effect they had
calban was not even staggered his huge
paw closed on corbetts neck engulfing
it with its vast span his swarthy other
hand drove for the mans groin

  somehow a thick stick was in leilas
hand and she was hurling herself shrill-
ing primitive fury at the monster her
improvised club pounded against calbans
forehead he roared with anger rather
than pain and the hand that was reaching
for stans groin flicked sidewise instead

  it struck leila in midair catapulted
her backward crashing her into the
threshing cushion of a bush jarred and
half-stunned she saw calbans attack
focus again on stan saw her lover swept
from his feet saw him lifted high above
the grisly creatures head by straining
arms shaggy with a beasts black hair

  the terrible tableau etched itself on
leilas mind the gorilla-like brute his
bestial ferocity the more horrible for the
fact that he was no beast but a man de-
graded obscenely decadent poised mo-
mentarily motionless as he gathered his
forces for the throw that would smash
stan to a pulp above his head stan was
as motionless-rigid and helpless in the
gigantic grip of calbans leathery hands
at armpit and crotch his face contorted
and pallid his eyes staring in agony

tpor an eternal moment that awful
pause persisted and then the lurid
gleam of calbans beady avage eyes
flared more redly and the muscles in his

huge arms writhed snakelike beneath their
hairy skin and leila knew that in the next
instant they would sweep downward

  from somewhere a whistle shrilled
high and piercing through the quivering
terror of the woods it came again the
strange high sound that once before
leila had heard through black clouds of
death swirling about herself it froze cal-
ban to an astounding paralysis leashed
him as though it were a chain writhing
about his savage limbs leila could almost
see the death-thought seep unwilling from
the black and terrible frame

  calbans protest was a grisly roar blast-
ing through the black forest aisles the
huge arms bent slowly reluctantly let-
ting stan down

  the trooper twisted abruptly freed
himself from calbans loosening grip he
thudded to the ground sprang erect snarl-
ing 

  but the monster was gone had plunged
away into the veiling thickets for
minutes the lovers heard the threshing of
his huge evil body moving away and
then a sinister silence close about them
a silence sinister because it cloaked not
only the ravening man-beast but another
mysterious entity a lurking invisible be-
ing who was master of the monster
whose whistling command the brute
obeyed even in the height of his frenzy
twice leila had heard the weird whistle
twice it had saved her

  not her but stan it had been at stans
approach that the ravening human hound
had been called away that first time it
had been stan whose deadly peril had
just now been averted if it were not for
stan-

  god the youth groaned who is
he where did he come from he pulled
a trembling hand across his bruised fore-
head above his glazed unseen eyes
swayed with exhaustion why did he
quit just when he was about to slam me


terror tales

down and break every bone in nay body

  leila struggled out of the tangling
busk into which calban had flung her

  i dont know stan she was cold
icy cold with foreboding with realization
of a terrible enmity focused upon herself

  her throat damped as stan pitched
forward pounded limply down fey sod-
den and unconscious in spongy water-
soaked loam

  leila torched to him her hand flew
to a dark spreading stain on his shirt
found warm viscid wetness it was
blood his blood but calban had no
knife 

  moanieg die girl tore the shirt-stuff
away with trembling fingers the angling
wound across his ribs from which the
gory angry fluid gushed was no knife-
slash it was the jagged-edged path of a
bullet and under the fresh scarlet pour
was she mass of an old dot

  leifa ripped a hasty bandage from the
tatters to which her own frock had been
reduced worked frantically to stanch that
grisly sow and as she worked a vague
explanation of what had happened formed
in her mind

  his mad fathers bullet had ploughed
across stans ribs had flung him down
unconsdous at the foot of tire stairs the
slow seepage had stopped itself he had
come awake hearing what he thought
was leila running out of the house he
had followed his exertions the battle
with the ape-faced monster had opened
the wound afresh weakened by the new
loss of blood he had fainted once more

  now he lay here unconscious in the
black depths of the forest he lay here
and she with him and somewhere in the
glimmering ominous shadows calban
till roved and   

  leilas neck prickled abruptly with
the sense of eyes upon her of glaring
hostile eyes leaves rustled stealthily

she crouched low over stans senseless
form throwing the frail protection of her
slight body athwart him and quivered
with die knowledge that out of the murk
her enemy was creeping silently to leap
upon her and destroy her

tk leapupon her it was she leifa
monroy the unseen adversary threat-
ened not stan stans danger fay only in
that she was with him twice that had
been proved if she could lead the chase
away from stan   

  she leaped from her lovers recumbent
form

  come and get me she cried and was
hurtling once more through the lashing
tearing brambles of the woods was run-
ning headlong and blindly through the
shadowed aisles not knowing where she
ran not caring so long as it was away
from stan so long as she led the destroyer
away from the man she loved

  the forest crashed into sudden life be-
hind her some one was following her
was flinging after her a hollow echoing
shout its threat spurred her to renewed
efforts

  despairing frantic the gasping fear-
goaded girl catapulted through the tearing
brambles crashed into stunning tree-
trunks caromed off and ran on

  and then quite suddenly leila was oat
of the forest she was running down a
wet but grass-soft slope and before ter
across the familiar pasture was the
yellow-windowed bulk of her own house
black against a sky tinted by the haunting
gray of false dawn

  almost at once she was in her own
back yard was leaping up the back-porch
steps was tugging at the knob of a friend-
ly kitchen door it resisted her efforts it
would not open she gasped remembering
that she had herself locked it from the
inside
priestess of murder



  unhoped for safety tantalizingly
offered at the last moment was snatched
away leila whirled to meet the fate from
which she had fled

  silver of the setting moon sluiced an
empty field no one nothing was there
she had outdistanced her invisible pur-
suer had left him behind in the forest

  or had he fooled her as she had
thought to fool him  had he left her flee-
ing blindly through the woods while he
turned back to pounce upon and destroy
the lover she had planned to save by her
rejected sacrifice

  something moved there in the ribbon
of darkness that was the forest-edge
across the fields something moved and
came lumbering out into the brooding
lunar luminance a two-headed grotesque
monster it came slowly inexorably out of
the shadows gelid fingers clutched leilas
throat what nightmare thing was this
what awful spawn of the dark forest

  the porch floor heaved beneath her
feet threw her back against the paint-
peeled door it wasnt there she fell
backward through it fell against a warm
feminine figure

  whats the matter eve starr ex-
claimed where have you been

  close the door leila screamed
close it somehow she was on her feet
again had her hand on the wood of the
portal she threw a single terrified glance
through the opening-

  and checked the closing panel nearer
and distinct now in the silvery light she
saw what it was that had come out of the
woods saw stans lolling pallid face
saw that he was leaning heavily on the
shoulder of another man of-her blood
was a black flood in her veins-of foster
corbett of his grizzled father who she
thought lay dead at the foot of west
cliffs high parapet

  she knew now who was calbans mas-
ter she knew now whose high shrill

whistle it was that had twice driven the
monster from his prey-to save stan
corbett-

chapter five

into the grisly night

t eila eve cried why is your
door broken down and the place
upset whats scared you so

  leila monroy twisted to her fell back
in astonishment the girl whom last she
had seen with a few shreds of torn cloth-
ing fluttering from her lacerated almost
naked form was fully dressed her hair
carefully arranged no signs of the wild
night about her

  i saw your lights come on after the
storm and i came over to see if anything
was the matter i found-

  eve cut off as stumbling feet pounded
on the boards outside the door as foster
corbett staggered in with his grey-faced
limp burden

  stan mr corbett in the name of
all thats holy whats been going on here
never-mind-now the older man
grunted help me

  leila jumped to his side eve to-
gether the three lifted stan from his wav-
ering legs carried him in to the living
room where hours ago leila had cringed
from the whispered lash of fancied voices
and laid the youth on the couch there
stan groaned his lids flickered open

 where - where - dad his eyes
lighted up leila you-youre both
here both all right

  fairly all right son the old man an-
swered

  there was a black bruise on his brow
another on his check his clothing was
smeared with the brown loam into which
he had fallen his shoes were packed with
it otherwise he seemed unhurt his


terror tales

bleared broodieg gaze fastened n leila
slid to eve went back to stan

  well do but you need a doctor ill
call-

  no stan shoved himself up to a
sitting position and leila winced as his
face twitched with the pain of the effort
no im kind of frayed at the edges
bat itt test fra like eve i want to know
what this is all about

  leila started to speak but the old man
beat her to it

  wed all hke to know that stan sup-
pose you give us your story first

  he was starting wrong end to leila
thought there was a reason for that
he was concealing something of course
he was concealing something he was cal-
bans master he was the moving force
behind all the terrible events of the night
and he wanted first to hear how much
the others knew before he concocted his
own story to fit she wouldnt interfere
shed keep quiet and give him rope enough
to hang himself and then   

  but stan was talking i tried to get to
leila after the trial but she was gone by
the time i managed to shove through the
crowd i saw eve though told her to teh
leila id come to her as coon as my tour
of duty was over

  the storm caught me as i came up the
road lesas lights were all on i heard
a scream from the house and she didnt
answer when i knocked on the door that
scared me i went frantic started to batter
down the door the lights went out just as
it gave way i ploughed in yefiing for her
the lightning showed me she wasnt on
the lower floor i started up the stairs i
heard her scream again a shot jabbed
me it seared across my ribs jolted me
off balance

  i guess i must have gone down on my
head and knocked myself out because the
next thing i knew it seemed a long time

after i heard the door dose and saw her
running into the woods

  leilas eyes sicked to eve the girl
was listening open-mouthed did not in-
terrupt to correct stans misapprehension
that was queer queer as her evident ig-
norance of all that had happened to her
or had seemed to have happened to her
if she had lain apparently dead on the
bed above if she had run screaming in
terror of leila herself through the woods
how could she be so neatly dressed so
undisturbed  the awful doubt of her
own reason closed in once more on leila
with ks nameless fear

  unaccountably the brute dropped me
and-and i fainted again from loss of
wood stan finished then you were
bending over me dad were helping me
up

  how about you leila  foster cor-
bett turned to her whats your end of
the story

ttis eyes bored into her and in their
rheumy depths she saw little light
of triumph crawl if she answered she
must convict herself-of sheer incredible
madness of madness t how could she
tdl of finding eve apparently dead of the
strange scene of her terror in the woods
when the girl hersdf was so cahn so un-
perturbed so evidently ignorant of it all
that how could she confess to the at-
tack on stans father

  her mouth opened dosed again she
swayed put out a groping hand to die
arm of a chair to keep hersdf from fall-
ing and eve came to her rescue

  cant you see how weak she is mr
corbett the dark-haired girl indignantly
exclaimed as she jumped to leilas side
and hdped her into the chair she cant
talk

  but weve got to get at the bottom of
this thing corbett insisted theres
something damned queer going on
priestess of mrper



  seems to me youve gat a story too
eve countered why dont you tell it
had the same thought occurred to her
too leila wondered that the old man had
taken charge of the situation in order to
cover up his own guilt  how come you
were out there in the woods at this time
of the morning

  yes dad stan put in thats puzz-
ling rat too

  corbett made a peculiar little gesture
with his gnarled hands as of defeat
i cant help much he said but ill
tell what i know when the storm broke
i thought of leila and looked out of my
window to try and see if she were alone
over here the lightning struck into that
line of poplars between our farms i saw
some one among them just at the spot
where we found shean rourke a dark
crouching figure watching the monroy
house there was something indescrib-
ably menacing in his pose and it flashed
on me that perhaps we had been alt wrong
about justins being rourkes murderer
that perhaps this was the real killer and
that now he was after leila

  he started moving in the moment i
glimpsed him dodging low in the high
grass of the pasture i lost sight of him
i ran to the phone to warn leila i just
had time to tell her to lock her doors and
windows when the wire went dead i
snatched up my gun ran out to come to
her aid

  her lights were going on i saw her
shadow going from window to window
pulling the screens across them and then
i saw the fellow id spotted before he
had climbed to the little roof over the
kitchen porch was sliding into a window
up there

  i knew that because of my own warn-
ing leifa would not open the door to me
by the time i got her to understand the
prowler would catch her would kill her
my only course was to go after him the

way he had entered try to catch him be-
fore he did any damage

  the storm redoubled in violence and
i am an old man it took me hours it
seemed before i managed to get to the
house before i managed to climb up to
that small slanting roof i heard a muf-
fled scream from inside as i got into the
room up there heard a damnable pande-
monium going on the room was pitch
black id a minute passed before i found
die door and got out into the hall

  just as i did so the door crashed in
below i twited to the stairway heard
some one shout down there as he cane in
could not make out the words then i
recognized stans voice and m the same
instant some one screamed behind me

  some one screamed and a black form
suited at me from somewhere behind
struck me the blow jolted my finger that
was pressing the trigger of the gun and
fired the shot i whipped around in time
to see that same dark grotesque form
pounce on leila and carry her off i
shouted did not dare shoot for fear of
hitting her

  the invader hurtled along the corridor
dived into a room at the very end i went
after him yelling for stan

  i was out dad and didnt hear you
so j know now that room door was
jammed and by the time i opened it the
chamber was empty but the window was
open and through it i saw the kidnaper
vanishing into the wood leila still on his
shoulder i saw that he must have climbed
down a rainspout that passed the window
but i didnt dare follow that way

  the head of the back stairs however
was at this end of the corridor i ran
down them out through the back door
again across the fields and into the forest
where i had seen the fellow vanish

  in the storm i couldnt trail him i
shouted fired off my gun in the hope
leila would respond in vain then the


terror tales

storm was over as suddenly as it had
begun the clouds started to break moon-
light sifting through showed me tram-
pled bushes shreds of a girls clothing
caught on briars i followed that trail
reached the face of west cliff just above
where the spoor ended i saw the mouth
of a cave thought i sensed movement
within it possibly i thought my shots
had scared the kidnaper away and leila
was alone up there i started to climb
up to it suddenly rocks started to fly
down at me one struck me on the head
i felt myself falling struck and lost con-
sciousness

it fitted leila thought his story
fitted was it the truth or a tissue of
lies somehow it explained everything
too patly everything except who the mon-
ster was and where he had come from
except the mystery of eve starrs weird
part in the dreadful night eves face
was an expressionless mask her unfath-
omable eyes fixed on corbetts seamed
horribly tired countenance

  when i came to i heard the sounds
of struggle far-off a pile of dead leaves
had cushioned my fall i wasnt badly
hurt i staggered to my feet ploughed
tli rough the woods and found stan
knocked out

  or had he come on that scene just a
little earlier in time to whistle off calban
in time to send the monster ravening
after her through the woods was he
playing still for a chance to get her alone
to finish her the speculation wrenched
a groan from the bemused girl

  leila eve exclaimed youre white
you look as though you were going to
faint ill get you some water

  she was out of the room as her sen-
tence ended the kitchen door swung
closed behind her

  leila foster corbett spun to her

what do you know of eves actions to-
night have you seen her

  a scream sliced across her amazing
question a scream from behind the kitch-
en door corbett slewed around gun in
hand he hurled himself across the room 
pounded that door open the brick-walled
room beyond was starkly gruesomely va-
cant but the back door was just slam-
ming shut and from beyond it a thin high
wail of infinite terror told where eve had
vanished

  hes got her now the old man
yelled i was wrong come on stan
and then he too was gone into the grisly
night

chapter six

 monster at play

t eila monroy came up out of her
chair fighting the intangible but cloy-
ing threads of her weakness fighting a
giddy nausea that whirled within her skull
and tweaked at the pit of her stomach
through that dizzy whirlpool she saw
stans vague form dart past her lurched
to follow it the room seemed to whirl
about her as she moved there was a wall
where the door should be a wall into
which she jolted

  half-stunned she pawed at the parti-
tion found the door away from which
she had reeled in her vertigo reeled
through the kitchen a place of black
threatening shadows danced about her
she staggered across it stabbed at the
outer door missed it pulled in an agoniz-
ing breath and tried again

  this time leila contrived to grab the
doorknob as it went by and steadied her-
self by it gripping the jamb with her
other hand she fought to get the portal
open succeeded

  something lay a black unmoving bulk
on the porch outside stan it must be
priestess of murder



stan her bewildered fear jabbed at her
and she went to her knees beside it she
pawed at it her bhirred vision stilf re-
fusing to dear   

  the body came suddenly alive rolled
over the apelike ferocious visage of
the monster glared at her black ups
curling away from yehow fangs in a
strange jabbering laugh of bestial tri-
umph

  a scream sliced her throat and then
calbans gigantic arms flailed around her
crushing her to him crushing her ribs
clamping that scream to silence in her
breathless luiags he surged to his feet
bringing her up with him as though she
had no weight at all he lurched back
into the house with her

  through the kitchen the living room he
ploughed chuckling lewd glee into the
foyer hall he shouldered the piggish little
eyes under his beetling brows lurid with
an obscene light his calloused rasping
fingers writhing as though with some vile
life of their own on her shrinking quiv-
ering flesh leilas larynx swelled once
more with a shriek but calban caught her
intention by some unhuman second-sight
and gagged her-gagged her horribly with
the pressure of his slobbering evil lips
on hers in a kiss of ultimate horror

  crushed thus in the viselike cradle of
the beast-mans arms gagged thus by his
insufferable caress leila knew that he
was carrying her up the broad stairs to
the passage above to the passage where
her own room was her own bed-

  no doubt now no doubt at all of what
the brute-man intended

  no doubt of what he intended or of
what had happened he had been waiting
outside had grabbed eve and-killed her
probably foster corbett had taken ad-
vantage of the girls one cry to get out of
the way himself to get stan out of the
way-and had sent back his creature to
finish off leila stans unlooked for pres-

ence time and time again had interfered
with his macaber plans but stan was out
of the tray now and leila was in cal-
bans power being carried up to the room
where the nights horror had begun and
now would be consummated

  calban was in die room thrusting the
door shat with a dextrous foot as he
passed through it twisting to the bed with
a swift surety that told of curious famili-
arity with its location even in that ter-
rible moment leila noted that noted that
her white spread was rumpled and blood-
flecked that the indentation of a contorted
figure was still visible on it then cal-
ban had flung her stunningly down on the
bed had pihned her to it with a digging
cruel kno as he tore avidly at what was
left of her clothing

  pretty he jabbered as he had jab-
bered before in the forest pretty cal-
ban likes

  he paused to gloat over the quivering
beauty his violating paws had revealed
calban likes very much

  leilas tortured eyes fled from the evil
anticipation of his thick-lipped drooling
mouth slid past the muedes of his terri-
ble arms her hopeless gaze slid along
the walls of her familiar room that now
was a ceil of madness and despair reached
the door it was opening  slowly silent-
ly it was opening and white fingers jogged
its edge

  the girls heart leaped

  please she whimpered pulling her
gaze back to her tormentor please cal-
ban let me go at all costs she must
distract his attention keep him from no-
ticing the advent of her rescuer ill
pay you ill give you lots of money
jewels 

  the monster gibbered his mindless
laugh calban no want money jewels
calban want pretty woman white soft
flesh of pretty woman like this-

  and suddenly he leaped away from her


terror tales

leaped to the center of the room and
whirled to the opening door some sixth
sense had warned him of danger   

qtan jumped into the room a long
carving knife in his hand that must
have come from the kitchen below

  leila  he yelled run jump out of
the window i can hold him long enough

  calban roared plunged at him stan
mot the attack with a darting slash of the
knife caught the monster across the
knuckles the beast-mans other fist
crashed against the troopers shoulder
slammed him against the wall leila
screamed started up from the bed

  calban twisted to her a flick of his
long arm pounded her back to the creak-
ing mattress stan rebounded from the
wall sliced at calban the giant sprang
backward avoiding the rush dropped to
the floor and rolled toward the trooper

  leila was out of the bed was darting
once more toward the window black
digits closed on stans ankles heaved
upward the trooper was flung high into
the air he twisted lithely came down on
his feet crouched to meet his snarling ad-
versarys lunge calbans juggernaut rush
swei-ved at the last instant and the girl
felt the impact of his fists once more
blasting her headlong away from at-
tempted escape she sprawled brought up
thumping against the wall

  stan ducked forward slashed a long
cut across the others leathery cheek cal-
ban squealed more in rage than pain
and exploded into a swift blur of action
which leilas eyes could not follow nor
stan avoid suddenly that whirling bat-
tle was static terribly static

  stan hung from the giants tight clutch
on his wrists hung from arms stretched
horizontally out from his shoulders in that
terrific grip crucified on an invisible
cross the troopers body was a taut
arc of suffering his face a fish-belly

white sweat-wet mask of hideous tor-
ture

  a low moan squealed from his rigid
throat squealed into sound get out-
leila-your chance  gurgled into a
nondescript gust of agony as calbans
gargantuan span of whipcord muscle
widened to crack the bone-jointures in his
shoulders with the gruesome power of its
living torture-rack

  leilas way to the door was clear as
long as calban held the straddle-legged
pose he must to continue his grisly tor-
ment of her lover this was her chance
to escape

  she shoved away from the wall to
which that last fierce buffet had flung her
came up to her feet came up to her feet
with the light bedroom chair in her hands
leaped toward calban and pounded the
improvised weapon down on his head

  the chair splintered smashed calban
let stan drop and whirled to leila he
was laughing actually he was laughing

  she-devil his twitching lips spewed
calban like you that way his hands
lashed out his fingers dug into the girls
shoulder sent fiery agony darting through
her twisting almost nude body calban
like woman that can fight but cant play
now must finish with man first tear
arms out legs like flys wings

  no leila screamed no leave him
alone do what you want with me but
leave him alone

albans simian visage was distorted
by his yellow-toothed imbecilic grin
calban do what he like with both she
was helpless infantile in his great hands
as he flung her once more on the bed as
he ripped the sheets into strips and lashed
her ankles her wrists lashed them tight-
ly cruelly pulling the knots with sadistic
violence the rough edges of the torn
linen cut into her shrieking flesh were
scarlet-edged with oozing blood
priestess of murder



  on the floor behind the savage giant a
long shudder ran through stan corbetts
crumpled rame and he was crawling
erawlitig as a stepped-upon beetle might in
whom life was not yet quite extinct bat
unlike that beetle the man moved with a
definite purpose a yard beyond his shak-
ing woodless hand lay the knife he had
dropped a yard-to his anguish en-
feebled body that yard was an infinite dis-
tance but if he could reach that knife 

  leila seeing stoppered in her throat
the moans of her own agony sought to
wrench from her and contrived a question
to hold calban long enough for stan to
succeed

  what will your master say if you harm
him your master doesnt want you
to   

  calban have no master the brute
roared rage flaring into his little eyes
no one tell calban what must or must
not do dismay pierced leila as he
twisted away from her as he lurched
toward stan whose scrabbling fingers
were still inches away from the knife
no one    

  the whistle shrilled in the whistle that
twice before had saved stan a vague
figure blotted the windows dim rectangle

  mr corbett leila screamed hes
killing stan calbans killing 

chapter seven

a bargain with the rend

tt wasnt foster corbett who came

  surging in through the aperture it
was eve astoundingly it was eve cal-
ban  she yelled

  the whistle hadnt stopped the monster
this time he was lifting the lacerated
almost unconscious man from the floor
by one hand and his other was at stans
throat

  calban eve cried again stop it

  the giant paused over the limp lolling
frame of his victim he glared atthe dark-
haired gni his face a gargoylesque de-
moniac visage

  no he chattered calban will not
be cheated any more calban will kill the
man and take the woman and your lies
will not stop him again

  calban i did not he to you gro-
tesque hideous this colloquy between the
slim daridy-beautiful girl whom leila
monroy had known all her life and the
beetle-browed barrel-chested savage who
was an atavism from the very dawn of
time it was you who forgot our bar-
gain and triad to force from me what i
promised would be yours when you fin-
ished the task i set you if you hadnt
attacked me choked me-

  oh god it was blasphemous even to
think his name in the presence of that
woman

you-you fiend leila burst out
you brought him here to kill me you-
eves glance flicked to her and it stung
leila as if the evil in it were a barbed
whiplash of frozen steel

  shut up she hissed you dont
count now

  then she was concentrating on the
giant

  calban she pleaded let him go let
him live

  lurid light-worms crawled sinisterly in
the brutes smail eyes no he grunted
and his throttling fingers started again to
close bit by cruel bit on stans throat
no you want him and youll never
give yourself to calban while he lives
thats it is it eves cry was ab-
ruptly a hollow whisper of defeat thats
what i must pay to save him  here then
calban hre

  her hands flew to her throat her fin-
gers fvrmed at the high lacy collar that
veiled it then the flimsy silk was rip-
ping as those white hands tore down


terror tales

through it ripping away from her chest
the creamy heaving rounds of her de-
sirous breasts the taut quivering hollow
of her abdomen the shredded fabric slid
down the long line of her thighs reached
the floor and she threw out her arms to
the beast-man in an abandon of seduc-
tion noisome as the uttermost depths of
hell and glorious as heaven itself glori-
ous because whatever the woman was
whatever evil had driven her she de-
scended now into hades to save the man
she loved

  the man she loved in that moment
the whole story was clear to leila eve
loved stan and-

  calban whimpered he let his victim
fall he lumbered uncouth shaken by
the tempest she had aroused within him
to the naked alluring form of the tempt-
ress luminous-seeming in the moonlight
glow his black arms slid around that
voluptuous form   

  by some accident of the inscrutable
fates stan had dropped right atop the
knife he so futilely had struggled to reach
his twitching bloodless hand closed on
its hilt   

  eve moaned shudderingly as calbans
shaggy arms enfolded her- that moan
seemed to explode in stan with a sudden
spasmodic strength he lifted to his knees
flung the knife   

  point first it was a silver flash streak-
ing the moonlight and then it was a black
excrescence quivering from the middle
of calbans back blood spurted   

  the monster squealed with the sudden
pain his great hands gripped the woman
they had been fondling flung her from
him in a paroxysm of rage she catapulted
into the wall the crackling thud of
crushing bone sickened leila   

  and then the bound girl was screaming
in terror for her lover as the wounded
beast-man whirled and plunged ferocious-
ly at the trooper who was swaying on his

knees was toppling over from the effort
alone of throwing that knife calbans
writhing fingers closed on stan  

  thunder crashed in the room it was
the thunder of foster corbetts gun blaz-
ing from the doorway long orange-red
jets of flame seared across the room cal-
baris great form jolted to the impacts of
the lethal lead once twice he collapsed
like a ripped meal sack rolled over near
his intended victim quivered and was still

  foster corbett came in he was mud-
covered from head to foot a blue bruise
blotched the seamed gray of his face and
one trouser leg flapped grotesquely some-
how in two disjointed halves

  but the mans old tired eyes glowed
with a strange satisfaction

  you gals sure can play hell he
growled when you get to fighting over
a boy he picked up the knife and
sliced leilas lashings then bent to his
sons flaccid form

  is-is he- leila dared not finish
the question but corbett understood and
answered it no hes just knocked out
and hes coming out of it now hell be
all right by noon i imagine right enough
to stand up with you in front of the par-
son and-

  he wouldnt marry me now leila
moaned he wouldnt marry the daugh-
ter of a madman

  madman hell corbett grunted
swinging around to eves crumpled
moaning body his gnarled fingers
probed the girls hurts with a curious ten-
temess then im afraid youre through
eve he said maybe things will be a
little better for your soul where its going
if you tell leila yourself 

  white lips moved in face that was
agony incarnate

  yes    i    swore you    never
would have   stan calban    imbecile

throw blame your father    kill stans
love for you its    killed me instead
a gush of blood burbled from her ups
she writhed to a sitting position threw
out her arms forgive me stan

  and then there wasnt an eve starr
any more only a pitiful nude corpse
slumped in a corner of the dreadful room

ftthey pieced it together afterward the
tale of that dreadful night how learn-
ing of stans message that her plot had
failed the love-maddened girl roust have
determined to have few mindless dope kill
leila how she must have sneaked into
leilas bedroom either np the rwa-spout
ladder or through the same window that
calban had entered how the imbecile
must haw attacked her choked her to
insensibility on the bed been seared away
by leilas tush by stasis pounding on
the doorway below    had been scared
away and then had attacked foster cor-

the woods to make certain calban had
done for leila the frightened girls
questions had given her the clue to leilas
fear of her own madness she had played
on that to torture her to lore her deeper
into the woods into calbans dutches
but stans appearance had once more dis-
rupted her plan

the

    because she loved him she had saved
 him then she had saved him again later
 when the imbecile took matters into his
 own hands but she had been able only
 at terrible cost to herself to save him the
 third time   

   it was horrible leila shuddered
 shrinking into stans arms it was a
 nightmare out of helis vilest depths
 but ft ended happily my darling
 stans ups were warm under her ear
 like the fairy stories and so they were
 matried and lived happily ever after 
 ever after leila murmured but
 flie ending of our fairy story is even bet-

   under the poplars that till now had
 ditided the monroy and the corbett
 farms that till now had made a line of
 ancient enmity two old men stood the
 taller one justin monroy pointed to the
 ground made a gesture with his fore-
 finger as though he were drawing a boun-
 dary foster corbett nodded hie two
 shook hands gravely

    theyve got it settled at last that old
  fight

   doesnt make much difference any
 more does it leila  the two farms wfll

tke devils emissary

by frances bragg middleton
author of deaths pagan mockery etc

sinisterly handsome
was the stranger who
brought a secret gift to
the girl whose dark beauty matched
his own    whence had he come
to what dank place would he soon return-bringing his victim

all day long i had been hoping
against hope that young philip
rice would reach palo alto plan-
tation house by supper time for a full
year we had heard nothing from him
had almost given up any expectation of


ever hearing from him again so my old
heart was set fluttering a bit by that per-
emptory knock and i went to the door
myself but when i reached it old jude
had already opened it i caught a glimpse
of bob shane the only taxi driver in the
the devils emissary



county as he hurried down the graveled
walk toward the gate only a glimpse
for he was almost out of sight behind the
jasmine bushes and my old eyes had been
drawn as by a magnet to the stranger who
stood in the doorway looking into the
gathering shadows of the hall

  i cant describe him he was tall and
slender and dark with a face of free wild
beauty his eyes were black-that black
which is a total absence of light and when
they looked at me i was lost in them com-
pletely filled with that insane desire
which comes to some men on the sum-
mits of high places-the desire to hurl
oneself over the parapet to the ground be-
low for with all his beauty and grace
there was about him something dreadful
something terrifying

  if you will pardon this intrusion-
the stranger began and his voice matched
the rest of him it was low and vibrant
at the sound of it i felt an icy hand close
hard around my heart i bring a-me-
mento-from young philip rice the
voice was continuing i left him-down
south there

  he made a curious gesture with his
long slender beautiful hands never had
i seen such hands as his so sensitive so
capable i am an old man and shocks are
bad for me i stood there gasping

a nd then quite unexpectedly he
smiled and i knew at once that my
fears were foolish i could see that he
was just an extraordinarily handsome
man who was asking hospitality at a door
which for more than a hundred years had
refused hospitality to none

  come in i begged in confusion
the place is crowded and im afraid i
must put you in sherburne rices room-
i spoke hesitantly for we never use
that room at all it has been called a
haunted room ever since sherburne rice
the second hurled a man out of it and

down the north stairway to the death of
a broken neck in the garden but this
was all hallows eve when all of us
gather to celebrate the date of the houses
building every room but that was full
and i was unwilling to thrust so strange
a guest upon any of my kin

  he smiled queerly

  i am sure i shall be at home there
he said my name is minos dis and i
come from a strange far country as i
said i have brought a remembrance from
your kinsman philip rice

  for me i asked

  i admit my voice was eager young
philip had occupied the limelight at the
family gathering last year he was an
explorer with an already brilliant and
bewildering history in spite of his youth

  again the stranger smiled that strange
haunting extraordinary smile

  i do not know yet for whom it is in-
tended he answered and his voice
though low and very very quiet had
something dreadful in it some hint of
doom unthinkable i have come to
learn

  and is philip-

  pie made a slight gesture with one per-
fect hand it silenced me as if those slen-
der fingers had closed around my throat

  i shall tell you all-presently was
all he said

  i myself led the way upstairs to sher-
burne rices room i did it reluctantly
but i could see nothing else to do and
yet somehow as i opened the door into
that orderly but long disused room i felt
that there was a certain significance a
certain fitness in ushering that man into
that particular room i could not under-
stand why i should feel so but i did i
saw to his comfort and left him there-in
that feared and haunted room

  and as i walked away through the dim
old hallway toward the stairs the mans
strange and foreign sounding name kept


terror tales

echoing through my mind it had some-
how a faint familiarity minos   
had that not been the name of a fabled
king of crete

  a strange name and a strange man
who laid claim to it surely but then
our house has long been used to strange-
ness and to heartbreak and to dread it
is an old house a pioneer house built
solidly and substantially of brick there
are heavy iron bars at the windows
there is a huge pantry behind the kitchen
and a deep cistern under the floor and in
its time its people have been thankful for
these things for palo alto has a dark
and flame-shot history they say that
pirate gold built it and that pirates and
buccaneers tried to raid it in the old days
and it is certain that k withstood a siege
in thirty-six by santa anas men and a
gritn and furious battle fought up and
down its stairways in sixty-five and
more heroic still when one of its women
was marooned there in the flood of ninety
nine she fought off the hungry drink-
crazed blacks and saved herself and her
two baby girls from horror indescribable
a strong hard breed those children of
fearfully remembered sherburne rice
who come back each thirty-first of oc-
tober which is the date ift the cornerstone
to celebrate the building of our house

oometimes strange things happen
 yet something always brings us to-
gether again the very fascination per-
haps of the autre and the unpredictable
and our very terror urges us to make of
it a very festive occasion even riotous
with all the halloween trappings and
old wine brought up from the cellar where
rodney rices wife was once walled up
alive  at least we are always glad
to see each other and we always make
a valiant effort to be gay with games and

dancing and laughter    but we were
not gay this year  

  it was dusk when i found patricia rice
standing alone on the wide front gal-
lery watching the darkness march down
the turgid river and i knew she was
thinking of that time thirty-six years ago
when the high ground the house stands
on was an island in a forty-mile-wide
sweep of muddy swirling water-and sho
stood there alone    patricia is an old
woman now a grave and sensitive and
understanding woman and some people
say a little psychic at times

  she spoke without looking at me

  i dont like it jerry something is
going to happen and its always queer
things that happen in this house   
awful things   

  youre thinking of the old days i
told her

  it isnt that altogether i can-feel-
something i have as eerie a feeling as
when i carried my babies into the burial
vault out yonder to escape those mad-
dened blacks  of course i do al-
ways remember too much when i come
here jerry i cant forget that i stood
guard beside the bones of sherburne rice
the pirate and sherburne rice the ter-
rible of reconstruction days i cant
forget that it was the negroes terror of
those very bones that saved me and my
babies but i lived through horror
too    and i had to kill two men   
it does something to you jerry gives you
a certain power    and i tell you
something horrible is hovering over us
something more horrible than anything
that has happened yet   

  i wish young philip rice was on his
way i grumbled uneasily its been so
long  

  but i couldnt go on and for a while
we stood in silence we who are old and
who remember such strange things as
for philip   
the devils emissary



tte had come to us that year for the
first time not one of us had ever
seen him before he had just got back
then from an exploring trip into the heart
of south america somewhere where
white men had never been before he had
tried to fly over an inaccessible jungle he
explained but the plane had crashed he
had come down in the outskirts of a city
as yet unknown to white men a bewilder-
ingly lovely deserted city his eyes grew
rapt as he talked about it he seemed to
be lost in memories his own enthusiasm
fired even our earth-bound imaginations
he made us feel that place-its unimag-
inable splendor its beauty its vastness its
unthinkable antiquity and as he talked
he seemed to me to be the very quintes-
sence of the rices to be possessed of all
their charm their beauty their love of
adventure and their valor without those
darker qualities for which so many of
them have been famed i loved the boy
and i hated the way his eyes were held
by morna lane

  a tribe of indians-mayas-lived near
the city he told us but they never entered
it except for religious ceremonies and
even then they barred him out so he
had to explore it by stealth taking his
life in his hands at every venture within
its sacred walls he had stumbled all by
accident upon a mayan treasure house
the natives would have killed him if they
had known

  for these mayas had a rabid dread of
white men around their fires at night
they told strange old legends of the con-
quistadors horrifying tales of pillage and
torture and enslavement there would
never be another invasion of white men
into their land they swore yet para-
doxically they had welcomed philip of-
fered him membership in their tribe made
of him a sort of reincarnation of their
fair god and i could understand that
looking at him down the table he was

one of those fortunates whom people love
at sight

   certainly our whole family fell in love
with him that night and he well he
fell in love with morna lane the step-
daughter of one of our many cousins
she was one of those fair girls whose
beauty seems to shine to dazzle mens
eyes and she was captivated with philip
-or with the things he stood for their
eyes were locked together while he told
his tale she was breathless eager and
she begged him to go back

  but you must she cried dont you
see you brought nothing out with you
you have no proof of your discovery
go back get pictures and specimens and
astonish the world    bring me a
mayan amulet phil

  philip laughed and shook his head he
knew the danger you see if he having
been a sort of god among the mayas
before his escape should now return   
it made me shiver even to guess at his
punishment besides the mayas had been
in the habit of sacrificing the incarnations
of their gods that old puzzling heathen
idea that the essence of the human god
must go back at stated times to keep the
godhead strong was one of the funda-
mentals of their religion no one knew
that better than philip   

  yet he did return to his mayan city
we heard about it later and the news
had made my heart sink as if under
leaden weights i am an old man and i
had loved that boy

  and now some one had come who
claimed to bring us news of him but
how weird and strange a messenger yes
i believed with patricia that somethin

o

was going to happen something dread-
ful something far worse than merely
strange   

tvtot one of the darkies would go to
sherburne rices room to summon


terror tales

our stranger guest to supper they made
various plausible-seeming excuses but i
understood they were afraid so i
climbed the weary stairs myself stairs
that had been tracked with human blood
these many times my hand trembled a
little as i knocked on sherburne rices
door

  that strange weirdly melodious voice
bade me enter but i did no more than
open the door the stranger stood bare-
headed in the lamplight the unearthly
beauty of him struck me with new force
my eyes were so lost in that compelling
gaze of his that i was barely conscious
of the box he held between his hands-
not a large box but extraordinary like
everything else about him it had the look
of having been made of a single opal yet
impossible as that seemed i know that i
thought nothing of it at the time

  he shook his head slowly at mention
of supper begged to be excused he
would join tis later he said and such
was the spell he had me under that i
could make no protest though deep down
in me was an almost paralyzing fear a
guest who would not eat our salt or break
our bread with us-was not that a guest
truly to be feared 

  bat as  turned away from that hated
room a queer choked-off cry jerked my
thoughts away terror lent me strength
i harried  patricias door and jerked
it open and lunged inside she was stand-
ing by the hearth in the full light of the
tall white candles on the mantel her
face was ghastly white and she held both
hands to her throat her eyes had that
supernatural look they sometimes have

  as i cried out at her in terror she low-
ered her hands and turned to look at me
slowly her eyes regained their sanity
she swallowed hard

  i thought for an instant that-some-
thing-had me by the throat-was throt-
tling me she whispered shakily fi-

i dont know  if sherburne rice is
walking--it might be a ghastly business
jerry it would be like him to want to
avenge his kinsman if- her voice died
in a hoarse rattle in her throat

  i got patricia downstairs somehow

a dreary business that supper one
of our sudden northers struck the
place just as the meal was served before
the fires could be built up to give adequate
warmth the house was starkly cold we
were all shivering when we came to the
loaded table and the wind was crying
in a banshees dirge through the leaves
of the live oaks keening under the eaves
around the cornices of the old house a
hound down in the quarters lifted his voice
in the eerie howling that tells you death
is passing and the negroes moved on
noiseless feet their dark skins grey their
eyes wild their hands a-quiver with ter-
ror and i could think of nothing but
young philip rice whose infatuation for
an empty-headed girl had sent him into
what must have been unthinkable peril-
and of the stranger who daimed to come
from him-and of the cool-eyed smiling
moma lane who sat across the table from
me   

  we old folks sat about the fire in the
back parlor after supper and listened to
the shrieks of the rising wind and told
tales under our breath of the bloody deeds
of sherburne rice the buccaneer and of
his grandson sherburne rice the second

  and while we whispered of past terrors
and bloody deeds the young people danced
in the big front parlor bobbed for apples
looked in mirrors and had their fortunes
told but their attempts at gaiety were
futile the blight of the strangers pres-
ence was on them too

  it was midnight when the stranger came
into the dim lamplight of the room where
we were waiting the box i had seen in
the haunted room upstairs was in his
the devils emissary



hands it seemed to me that a little chilly
wind not bom of the shrieking norther
outside came in with him and the far
away howling of the dog had now become
an anguished maddened whine of fright

  the music in the front room ceased
the young people crowded in with us
and sank down upon stools and cushions
around the fire morna lanes eager
piquant face stood out startlingly in the
soft light i could not keep my old eyes
away from her she seemed so excited
so avid for the news that was coming
and suddenly i knew that i hated her
and the stranger stood in the wide door-
way between the parlors and looked at us
with his unfathomable eyes

rou all knew philip rice he stated
quietly in his grave deep organ-
toned voice he was kin to you

  some few of us murmured in assent
philip had been kin to all of us except
to morna lane

  he went back to the village in the
jungle the sonorous voiced rolled on
he must have known that death awaited
him there yet he was driven by a force
he could not resist

  he paused and the silence was abso-
lute except for the soft crackle of the
fire and the wind and the howling dog

  he went back even then he might
have escaped his doom if he had been
careful for he had friends among the
mayas they are a remnant of a once
highly civilized and mighty race as yet
uncontaminated by intermarriage with
other breeds their great stone city is
an amazing place you would marvel at it
if i could make you see it where did
the stones in its walls come from they
are huge and expertly cut but what force
brought them from their distant quarry
what force lifted them to their destined
places in the towering walls no man
knows unthinkable wisdom those long

dead mayas must have had unthinkable
riches their ancient treasure house would
make the richest treasury in your world
look like a beggars pittance gold and
strangely wrought ornaments and glow-
ing gems why did philip rice persuade
the mayan girl who loved him to take him
there that place was holy he knew it
what untumable force could have sent
him there

  his black eyes moved from face to
face and i saw men and women sway
backward as his eyes moved over them
even as a field of grain sways when a
wind blows over it

  he took something exceedingly pre-
cious from that treasure house the
stranger said very quietly and his eyes
came to rest on the opalescent box be-
tween his hands

  i saw morna lane lean forward just a
trifle as if to see it better but her face
was inscrutable i could make nothing
of it could she have cared for philip
and still betray no sign now that he must
be dead

  the mayan girl loved him with a self-
less undemanding love she helped him
do the thing that he desired to do she
showed him a secret pass through the
hills because she loved him savage
women are like that sometimes    
women to whom love is everything even
though the loved one has no thought for
them-as philip certainly had none for
her his thought was all for the white
girl who had sent him back he was
mad to get for her the bauble she de-
manded and it was only through the
native girl that he could get it-so he took
it and started home-alone and he
might have escaped for the mayas made
no attempt to pursue him they but sent
a messenger after him with the severed
hand of the girl who had helped him
come back and burn their message said
or we burn the woman instead he did


terror tales

not hesitate he went back and they
gave his body to their gods

patricia screamed i think the rest
did too i couldnt my breath stuck
in my throat i was beyond the relief
of any outcry i was stunned

  the stranger watched us with his re-
lentless eyes those eyes that were black
with the blackness that is total absence of
light he lifted the priceless box that
was neither large nor small the box that
seemed to be made of a single fire-tinted
opal in his perfect hands

  this i bring back from the jungle he
cried a pulse throbbing in his voice as
the sacrificial drums must have throbbed
in the jungle while philip died it is
meant for some one here to whom does
it belong

  it was beautiful that box it glowed
in unbelievable glory in the light of the
leaping fire no rainbow in the world
could ever have shown such colors colors
that writhed and burned and faded and
burned again 

  but we drew back from it in horror it
was accursed for all its beauty it was
stained with another color that did not
show the color of philips blood

  it belongs to one of you the stranger
said inexorably

  i saw morna lane lean forward sud-
denly she gasped as a swimmer might
gasp on the brink of an icy plunge her
hand reached out drew back reached out
again she tried to speak and could not
the stranger gave her a long still look
from his fathomless eyes

  it is yours then he asked and his
voice was husky and filled with deep vi-
brations like the music that comes from
the strings of a bass viol

  still she could not speak but she nod-
ded jerkily and swallowed hard and her
outstretched fingers clenched and un-

clenched and clenched again in a spasm
of desire

   he laid that lovely priceless thing with-
in their grasp he turned slowly and
walked away his head bent like a man
who was very tired into the front parlor
and across it into the hall i watched him
climb the stair slowly and sadly and yet
with an air of duty done when he had
passed from sight my eyes came back to
that room of silence only one of  the
group had moved morna lane was gone
the rest sat still white-faced silent-
stricken   

tn the morning i went with weary plod-
ding feet to call our stranger guest to
breakfast it was late in the morning
then but only a few of the kin had come
downstairs and they looked as if they
had not slept the wind still howled the
hound was silent old jude had whis-
pered to me with tangled stammering
tongue that during the night the dog had
died of terror

  my old hand shook as i knocked on
the door of sherburne rices room there
was no answer and shaking as in a chill
i pushed the door open there was no
one in that haunted room there was no
sign that any one had ever been in it
nothing seemed to have been touched
even the bed was undisturbed even as
he had refused to eat at our table so it
seemed he had refused to sleep beneath
our roof

  slowly painfully i stumbled down the
stair never had i felt so old and helpless
and dismayed patricia took my arm in
the lower hall and for the first time in
my life i was glad of a womans help
somehow she got me to the telephone
after what seemed hours of fumbling i
got bob shane the taxi driver on the
wire when had he taken the stranger
back to town 
the devils emissary



  but i never brought nobody out to
palo alto he bawled in exasperation
nobody at all old jude mustve gone
plum loco i brought out a small package
that come by express an i left it with
that old dumb nigger at the door whats
the matter with the old hellion-any-
how

  i	couldnt answer him the receiver
dropped from my nerveless hand i was
sick but there was something i had to
do

  that box- i gasped to patricia
quick weve got to find out what was
in that box-

  morna isnt down yet patricia ob-
jected most of tiie young folks arent
up late last night you know-

  it makes no difference i mumbled
weve got to find out patricia i tell
you weve got to find out

  i	saw her own face whiten i dont
know whether her thought was the same
as mine i never did know for we never
talked about it afterward but she helped
me back upstairs and down the hall to the
room that was morna lanes

  she didnt answer when we knocked
and her door was locked i had to send
for some of the men to break it down
and then i wished i could have left it

locked till judgment day i can never get
that picture from before my eyes

  the opaline box lay on the night table
by the bed it was open and empty
morna lay cold and quiet in her bed
her white hands still gripped the wrist
of a severed brown hand that clutched
her throat in a desperate futile effort to
wrench it away-a brown hand that had
once been part of a mayan maid who had
loved and aided philip rice and momas
face  that is what i would almost
be willing to give my immortal soul to
forget but forget i cannot

  and even as we stared spellbound with
horror the brown fingers relaxed their
grip the hand fell to the pillow and lay
still its work well done

  sherburne rice- patricia was bab-
bling hysterically over and over the
vegeance of sherburne rice-

  but i was not so sure i stood there
thinking of the strange man who called
himself minos dis the man who ate not
and slept not in our house-the man
whom bob shane had not been able to
see and i remembered then that dis is
another name for pluto the god of the
nether world and that minos was one of
the judges who rendered judgments there
perhaps  but how could it be other-
wise the man was death

eileen gannon was just hang-
ing up the dish towel on the rack
beside the kitchen sink when she
john omarras car as it came into
the driveway and stopped by the gaa-
nqns back door a slightly annoyed look
settled across the girls pretty face john
omarra always made her feel strangely
of late john with
heavy black brows and his habit of
scowling at nothing he insisted he was

an eerie full-length novel
of haunting mystery
and terror
loved pain

in love with eileen but when he came to
see her he would often just sit there star-
ing at nancy eileens eighteen year old
sister eileen couldnt understand him
but for some reason she was afraid of of-
fending him by showing her uneasiness

  she looked at the clock it was just

seven oclock in the evening-early for
callers even in blaiffield

quick footsteps sounded on the back
porch and the kitchen door banged open
john omarra stood there for a moment
breathing quickly

hello john the girls hands went



 it was the spirit of the devil the
 good irish folk said that infested
 and blackened the soul of lovel
 nancy gannon for nancy smiled
 at the sight of blood and laughed
 when men died in agony-and at
 times her strange heart-numbing
 joy drove her to dance naked in
 the moonlight with

 up on him

to her hair then smoothed the apron over
her slim hips i wasnt expecting you this
evening

  didnt come to see you this time
eileen john omarra made a quick
nervous jerk with his head wheres
your dad

  in the living room a look of sudden
alarm spread over the girls face whats
happened whats wrong

  plenty

  john omarra went through the small
dining room of the gannon home with
eileen at his heels paddy gannon eil-
eens father big and barrel-chested with
black hair that showed no sign of grey
was sitting beside a table lamp reading
his paper his wife frail but bright-look-
ing was knitting at the other side of the
table mr gannon raised his eyes looked
at john omarras face and let his paper
drop to the floor

  trouble eh johnny

  yes sir a cave-in eddie dwyer is
trapped

  a cave-in paddy gannons voice
became a growl how could that hap-
pen i looked that tunnel over just be-
fore sundown theres something very
dirty going on johnny

  he stamped out into the hall and got his
hat

  eileen went over and stood close to her
mother the two women watched with
fearful eyes as paddy gannon opened
the drawer of the living room table took
out a white brassard and slipped it on his
left arm

  as they started out john omarra said
ive got to get father doyle mr gan-
non ill see you at the shaft

  is there a doctor there 

  yes sir one of the boys got dr
akers

  the noise of paddy gannons small car
joined that of john omarras for a mo-

ment behind the house then they both
roared out of the driveway

tvfrs gannon tightened her arm
around eileens waist trouble
eileen darlin trouble black days are
upon us working the mines in the dead
of the night sneaking the coal out in
trucks that dont turn on their engines un-
til they reach the bottom of the hill
fights with the company men now this
secret society the silents they call them-
selves secret societies breed trouble
this is the third accident in two weeks
it seems as if a curse has been put on
the blairfield mines-

  eileen interrupted her mother
wheres nancy

  her mother blinked once or twice
nancy went out right after dinner i
suppose shes over at the crowleys house
   eileen have you noticed anything
strange about nancy of late sometimes
the child frightens me

  eileens bright blue eyes looked into
her mothers tired grey ones and she
caught her lip between her teeth well
you know how girls are when they reach
eighteen theyre always hard to under-
stand at that age

  but youre twenty-one mrs gannon
said you didnt behave so strangely at
her age sometimes- the womans voice
dropped to almost a whisper-some-
times i feel that shes not my own daugh-
ter at all

  hush mother eileen patted the older
womans shoulder im going out for a
little while do you mind

  out her mother glanced toward
the window but its starting to rain
where are you going 

  up to the mine

  now eileen-dont go up there you
know your father wouldnt like it they
dont want the women up there especially
when theres trouble there will be a
the girl who loved pain



rough crowd up there-and besides youll
get drenched

  ill wear my slicker and rubbers and
mind my own business eileen said ill
keep out of their way if you want any-
thing before i come back neil is upstairs
doing his home work isnt he

  yes like a good boy but i wish you
wouldnt go

  i wont be long eileen was pulling
on her raincoat adjusting a soft felt hat
so it would deflect the rain from her face
and neck she opened the door on a night
that was black with a wind-driven rain  

  there was a group of a score or so of
men gathered around the mouth of the
shaft in the blairfield coat mines coal
oil torches flared and sent out fitful down-
thtust flames m the storm wind the ring
of faces around the entrance to the shaft
was picked out in red and black lights
and shadows mostly men because the
women had been forbidden to come eddie
dwyers mother and sisters were there
for it was eddie who was trapped in the
tunnel their faces were no less grimly
expectant than those of the other watch-
ers paddy gannon and the doctor and
priest were in the shaft with the shift that
was trying to dig through to eddie
dwyer no word was spoken in the wait-
ing huddle

  off to one side on a slight rise made
by a dump pile two figures stood alone
the man was straight as a pine tree
dressed in rags and his long snow-white
beard was spread out on his chest by the
wind so that it looked like a white jacket
the girl was slender and she wore neither
hat nor coat her black hair curled in
the rain and her thin dress was so wet it
clung to her every contour revealing a
figure beautifully and youthfully femi-
nine she had a lovely elfin face with
large eyes that seemed to tilt up gently
at the outer comers and her hair was
blown back showing tiny ears that came

  to points at the edges there was a strange
expression on her face as she stood there
beside the old man heedless of the ele-
ments watching the groups around the
shaft she looked like a person who is
witnessing a pageant of rare beauty her
lovely lips were half parted like a childs
in front of a christmas tree the old man
just stood beside her still and without
expression standing there together they
looked in the weird light of the torches
like the study of an inspired sculptor

tpileen gannon came up the hill
skirted the group at the mouth of the
mine shaft and climbed the little rise
to where the girl and the old man were
standing she seized the girls arm nan-
cy what are you doing here standing
in the rain without hat or coat youd
better come home

  the white-bearded man turned his head
once to look at eileen then looked away
again nancy gannon turned her lovely
young face toward her sister oh eil-
een  isnt that a beautiful picture  those
people huddled in the rain and torch-
light with their faces hard with worry
and sharp with pain-waiting waiting
it is so beautiful it fills me with de-
light makes me want to run and leap
and sing    

  nancy her sisters voice was brisk
eddie dwyer is trapped in there daddy
is one of the men trying to get him out
he and the others might get caught in a
cave-in before they can reach eddie
youre talking nonsense and youll catch
your death of cold come come home
with me at once

  all right eileen nancy said slowly
but i hate to leave such a lovely sight
   good night seamus ocallahan   
lovely like the little folk gathered around
their fire waiting for one of their mates
who has been trapped in the world and
is late in coming

  eileen twitched her sisters arm keep


terror tales

  still and hurry they had gone a dozen
paces or so when eileen said why do
you talk to that old hermit seamus ocal-
lahan everyone knows hes crazy peo-
ple will talk if they see you with him like
that youve been told before

  seamus ocallahan is not crazy
nancy said he is a gentle and kind man
with a sensitive soul he sees beauty with
eyes that others lack he talks to me until
i too can see beauty

  if i tell dad youve been talking to
seamus ocallahan and calling it beau-
tiful that eddie dwyer got trapped in the
cave-in hell take a strap to you even
if you are eighteen

  nancy shivered and started to walk
faster her voice had a quieter more
normal pitch when she spoke this time
im wet through lets hurry

  the two sisters were lying side by side
in bed when they heard their fathers car
come into the yard they heard him stamp
up the back steps into the kitchen mrs
gannon was up waiting for her hus-
band with a pot of coffee on the stove
the girls could hear them talking in the
kitchen right below the bedroom

  did you get him out mrs gannon
asked

  yes paddy gannon rumbled we
got him out-too late dead he was when
we got to him too late for priest or doc-
tor  i tell you mary there is some-
thing very dirty about it all its not nat-
ural its like the place was bewitched
three accidents without any reason or
cause one after the other for all the
world as if there was a black spell put
on the place

chapter two

black clouds

iileen gannon dropped off to
sleep to dream of the grrim tableau
at the mine again she saw the huddle of
anxious fear-ridden figures at the mouth

of the shaft no word or cry had been
uttered at the shaft but eileen dreamed
that somebody cried out-sharply the
cry came again cut through the veil of
sleep it seemed still to echo in the quiet
house when eileen sat up in bed fully
awake

  nancy moved restlessly by her side
but did not answer when eileen spoke to
her eileen leaned close and saw her sis-
ters eyes were shut and that she breathed
like a person in a deep sleep this time
the noise was a frightened whimper and
it came from the next room eileen
slipped out of bed and pulled on her robe
as she went through the door to her
young brothers room she switched on
the light

  neil her ten year old brother was sit-
ting up in bed his eyes round discs of
fright he was still whimpering

  what is it neil

  eileen approached the boys bed he
looked at her without answering

  paddy gannon came thumping into the
room in his bare feet wearing an old
fashioned flannel night shirt whats
this was that you screaming son

  i dont know the boy said slowly
i dont know if i screamed but i was
asleep and it was like as if somebody
was holding a light over me then some-
body slapped my face hard three or
four times then the light seemed to go
out and i woke up

bad dreams  mr gannon scoffed
too much sweet stuff on your stomach
no the boy protested somebody
was really slapping me i can still feel
my face sting

  eileen leaned over the boys bed yes
dad his face is red just as if he had
been slapped red and white welts
wrinkles in the pillow mr gannon
rumbled go back to sleep neil and
dont let me hear any more out of you
the girl who loved pain



you frightened your mother out of a
sound sleep

  the boy put his hand gingerly to the
side of his face then slowly lay back
yes sir

tileen turned and went back to her
room she switched on the small bed
lamp for a second the faint smell of
hot wax came to her nostrils there was
a candle in a pewter stick on the bedside
table-purely an ornament but there
was a little pool of melted wax around the
wick the wick when she touched it
was still warm the candle was on
nancys side within easy reach of her
hand eileen stood there looking down
at her sister with a strange half-fright-
ened expression but nancys lovely faun-
like face was wreathed in an innocent
sleep smile the neck of her nightdress
wag -awry showing the white throat and
the sweu of her breast half child half
woman-all lovely

  slowly shaking her head eileen
crawled back into her side of their bed
nt no it couldnt have been nancy
she wouldnt have done that    but his
face was streaked and that candle was
lighted only a short while ago qh no
not my sister nancy its unthink-
able   

  the next evening nancy was not home
for dinner and the gannons sat down
without her from time to time paddy
gannon looked at the clock and demanded
sourly whefes nancy whats keep-
ing her

  i dont know mrs gannon said at
length she must be over at the crow-
leys i cant think of where else she
could be

  paddy gannon finished his second cup
of coffee and thumped his napkin down
on the table im going after her what
kind of conduct does she call that  not
coming home to meals staying out by
herself after dark wandering around it

seems you havent taught your second
daughter the things she should know
mary its time i took a hand he filled
his pipe put on his hat and coat and
stamped out

  oh dear mrs gannon breathed
fearfully i hope she is at crowleys i
do hope she is

  eileen patted her mothers shoulders re-
assuringly but there was a serious cast to
her pretty face as she carried the dishes
into the kitchen mr gannon had not yet
returned when paul savage came to see
eileen he was a slim good-looking
young man with a rather solemn expres-
sion he dressed much better than most
of the young men of blairfield he was
in the- living room talking to mrs gannon
when neil came out to the kitchen where
his sister eileen was putting away the
silver

  that paul savage is out m the parlor
waiting for you neil said

  you dont like him do you neil
eileen smiled

  aw hes a dude i like john omarra
why dont you marry johnny omarra
sis hes regular and hes a big shot
in the silents

  sshr eileen put her finger to her
lips you shouldnt talk about that you
know it

  huh neil muttered everybody
knows who the silents are pops one of
them thats why he dont like a com-
pany man like paul savage coming
around to see you he likes johnny
omarra too

  you keep still eileen warned him
or youll get yourself in trouble

  she took off her apron and went into
the living room paul savage rose from
his chair when he smiled he looked
much younger

  would you and your mother like to
go to the movies  he asked

  no mrs gannon said quickly then


terror tales

added thank you paul but i want to
wait for mr gannon you and eileen
go

   game out in the kitchen paul eileen
said i want to show you something

ince in the kitchen eileen closed the
door and faced the young man paul
im terribly worried about nancy thats
where dad is now out looking for her
i want to wait until he gets back shes
been acting awfully strange of late
paul took her hand eileen why dont
you stop worrying about your silly sister
and listen to me i want to marry you
eileen

   dont call her silly please eileen
begged im really worried

  as long as you must talk about her
paul said all right people are begin-
ning to notice that shes-well-different
shes the prettiest girl around not count-
ing you of course yet she scares the
fellows away because she never wants
to do the ordinary things she wants
them to go out and run in the rain with
her instead of going to the movies she
doesnt talk like anybody in blairfield
she could have any young man in town
if she stopped being like that

  what are people saying about her
eileen asked

  paul savage shrugged oh i dont
listen to gossip its you im interested

  youre sweet paul but im worried
   oh heres dad now

  gannons car came into the yard and
stopped at the side of the house the
front door opened and eileen and paul
could hear mr gannons voice well i
found her

  mrs gannon said mildly where have
you been nancy dear

   i drove all over town looking for her
paddy gannon growled and where do

you think i found her in the grave
yard-thats where i was driving past
slow thinking and worrying and i heard
nancys laugh i hopped the fence and
there she was sitting on a tombstone in
the dark by the side of a newly filled
grave talking to crazy old seamus ocal-
lahan the two of them perched there
on a headstone for all the world like two
ghouls and crazy old seamus telling her
mad stories about the little folk and the
banshee and the leprechauns-fairy
stories

  well now mrs gannon said placat-
ingly theres a great many people
around here who still believe those things
and youd not call them crazy you said
yourself there was a black curse on the
blairfield mines if there are evil spirits
why cant there be-

  hold your tongue woman

  paddy gannon made a threatening ges-
ture toward his wife nancy stood there
watching and listening with a sort of
pleased smile on her lovely young face
mrs gannon made a helpless little ges-
ture and stopped talking

  havent i troubles enough gannon
demanded trouble getting the coal out
trouble with accidents that dont look like
accidents at all trouble with the com-
pany and the men and then my fine
young daughter spends hpr time in the
evening in the graveyard talking to a mad
hermit youre old enough to have done
with that childish stuff nancy look at
you why youre-youre a woman
old seamus tells such lovely stories
nancy said sweetly

  if i catch you talking to him again
ill take the strap to you gannon thun-
dered ill take the back of my hand to
you in the public street grown and all as
you are

  no nancy said softly dont beat
me you would be very unlucky the rest
of your days if you were to strike me
the girl who loved pain



what kind of talk is this gan-
non bellowed he took three quick
strides to pass between the table and his
wifes chair to reach his daughter his
foot caught in the electric lamp cord
swept the lamp off the table to crash
heavily on the floor in falling it had
missed mrs gannon by bare inches

  gannon stood there with the wrecked
lamp at his feet and for a second his face
was purple then the anger seemed to go
out of him

that almost hit you mary he told
his wife- tm sorry for my clumsiness
nancy looked from her father to her
mother and her face was calm and sweet
im going upstairs to bed

  in the kitchen eileen gannon turned
to paul savage you heard it sitting
on a headstone in the graveyard listening
to a crazy hermit tell stories paul im
so worried about her it isnt that she
herself is crazy im sure its just that
some times she isnt nancy at all mother
and dad dont know how to handle her
im afraid its up to me

  i wish i could help paul said but
shes your sister i wouldnt be much
use im afraid

  mr gannon came into the kitchen
stopped dead when he saw paul savage
hahl so youre here are you
good evening mr gannon

  i suppose you company men gan-
non said deliberately are all pleased to
hear that eddie dwyer died in a cave-in
you dont understand mr gannon
paul explained i only work for the
company but i know how they feel they
know you go in there and take out coal
and ship it out quietly by trucks they
know you have armed guards stand there
while the men work they could call in
other armed guards and cause bloodshed
they dont because all of the men in
blairfield worked in the mines for years
-and will work there again when things

open up but you work those shafts at
your own risk you know that mr gan-
non

  there has been a lot of mysterious
trouble lately gannon said i suppose
the company doesnt know about that
either 

  the company doesnt want trouble
paul insisted when hot-heads like john
omarra get excited they blame every-
thing on the company

  johnny omarra is loyal to his own
kind gannon said sharply

  hes a trouble maker paul answered
firmly things are bad enough without
men like omarra keeping things stirred
up

  if youre interested to know gannon
said slowly i look with more favor on
johnny omarra than on another who
was raised in blairfield and went away
and got a fine education and came back
to work for the company-against his
own kind

  i know you mean me paul said i
do work for the company so did you
for years as a mine foreman and when
things pick up youll be working for them
again-unless there is serious trouble

  thats not so gannon exploded
the company never intends to work
blairfield again and they hate to see us
scrape a few dollars out of it to keep
from starving

  paul savage shrugged id keep a
check on johnny omarra mr gannon
hes getting too big for his pants dont
let him get you into anything youll be
sorry for

  from outside came the rattle of a noisy
car coming into the driveway

  i think thats john now eileen said
please dont start any unpleasantness

  john omarra came in the back door
said good evening to mr gannon and
eileen and nodded curdy to paul savage
he stood there awkwardly for a moment


terror tales

then his heavy black brows drew down
and he said mr gannon could i speak
to you alone what i have to say is not
for the ears of company spies

  come with me gannon invited they
left the kitchen and went into the living
room

  johnny was just one of the boys
working in the mine when things were
good paul said meditatively now
with all this trouble hes getting to be a
person of consequence the men defer
to him and your father alike if your
father doesnt watch out hell be taking or-
ders from johnny omarra yet

  trouble eileen put her hands to her
temples the air is heavy with it its
like watching a black cloud come rolling
over the horizon she shivered

chapter three

who walks at night

tvtancy was sound asleep when eileen
retired the older sister stood look-
ing at the younger girl for several mo-
ments before putting out the light nan-
cys face was so sweet and childishly free
from lines the black hair clustered
around her temples and the lashes curled
smudge-black against the warm whiteness
of her cheek eileen bent and kissed her
sisters forehead very gently in sleep
nancys lips curved

  eileen stretched out beside her sister
but sleep was reluctant to come she
shifted position constantly but did it
gently so as not to disturb nancy even-
tually she dozed off a fitful tense sort
of half-oblivion instead of a sound re-
laxed slumber

  suddenly she snapped out of her half-
conscious state and sat bolt upright in
bed she reached over and tried to touch
nancy the other half of the bed was
empty

  smothering a frightened exclamation

eileen switched on the bed light her sis-
ter nancy was gone

  eileen sat there hands to her temples
trying to think coherently the house was
silent as a tomb if she started to look
for nancy it would wake her father and
mother then if nancy had left the
house there would be a terrific scene
paddy gannon would go looking for his
daughter and when he found her hed
give her a horrible beating not since they
were children had their father struck
either of them but eileen knew if her
father discovered nancy had left the
house a black rage would get the best
of him

  eileen covered her own face with her
hands no no i wont wake them ill
-ill just wait and pray shell come
back she must come back   

a n hour that dragged like a prison
sentence-then the clatter of a car
a thumping on the front door eileen
bounded from bed snatched her robe and
ran down the stairs her heart pounding

  something has happened something
has happened to nancy

  her fingers groped for the light switch
and then fumbled with the front door
latch she had to cling to the door jamb
to keep from surrendering to her trem-
bling knees and folding up on the floor

  john omarra pushed in his dark face
pale and his eyes bright with a strange
frightened look wheres your dad
in bed eileen stammered is some-
thing wrong  did something happen
to-

  get him up

  john omarras facial muscles jerked
as he said each word

 what goes on down there paddy
gannon bellowed from the stair head
its john omarra

  come down for gods sake john
shouted the shaft is haunted i saw
the girl who loved pain



it with my own eyes joe dixon and i
were on the second level waiting for the
bucket when all of a sudden joe says
in a scared voice look i looked and
saw something white gliding toward us
from the tunnel joe let a yell out of
him and stepped back-and fell down the
shaft hes killed i fired a shot right
at the ghost but it just disappeared
you must be drunk-or crazy

  no i saw it joe saw it too-and
thats what made him fall while we were
getting joes body out another one of the
boys saw it a white thing that seemed
to float along in the dark tunnel none of
the boys will go back in the shaft

  ill get dressed and be right with you
paddy gannon said

  eileen stood downstairs in the hall
clutching her robe around her what
did it look like-this thing you saw
could it have been a woman or a girl
no it was nothing human i tell you
i fired right at it

  you shot it eileens voice was un-
steady and it disappeared-where
just disappeared john repeated in-
to the blackness of the shaft

  mr gannon came clumping down the
stairs his shoes not yet laced he grabbed
his hat and coat haunted his voice
was scornful youd think you were
back hi the dark ages in ireland

  after they had gone eileen crept back
upstairs to bed she was trembling so she
had to grasp the banister with both
hands as she made the ascent once in
her room she threw herself face down on
the bed

  once more the house was very still-
the pounding of her own heart boomed
in her ears nancy gone  a white
figure in the mine-a ghost  joe dixon
hurtling to his death    john omarra
shooting point blank at the white
figure    nancy gone the words and
thoughts flooded her mind in a confused

and terrible jumble she was afraid as
she had never before known fear not
fear of a known thing-something tan-
gible you see and understand and fight
off-but a heart-chilling terror of some
unknown menace   

vv j hen she awoke the sun was stream-
ing in her window and the little clock
on the bedside table said six she turned
quickly nancy was lying there beside
her breathing regularly sleeping like a
child maybe it was all a horrible dream

  then she saw a red smear on the bed
sheet that covered nancys shouders she
drew back the covers nancys white
nightgown was torn at the right shoulder
and under the tear a crimson groove
marred the flawless skin not deep but
raw and angry looking it might have
been made by the branch of a tree run
into in the dark it might have been
made by the lash of a whip-or the sting
of a speeding bullet as it grazed its mark
eileen went quietly into the bathroom
and got the iodine bottle

  nancys eyes opened as the strong an-
tiseptic seared the red flesh of the wound
she looked up at her sister and smiled
sweetly

  it doesnt hurt much

 nancy eileen leaned over her
where have you been darling what
happened to your shoulder

  i have been asleep right here beside
you nancy murmured drowsily and
i had lovely dreams red lights in the
dark underground and yellow lights and
mens faces reflected and one face so
frightened the mans soul was stamped on
it like the brand of a white-hot iron it
was lovely   then she closed her eyes
again and slept

  eileen threw back the covers nancys
bare feet were bruised and soiled with a
thick black dirt like coal dust   
gently eileen covered her sister and


terror tales

tip-toed from the room she had to get
out into the air out and walk in the sun-
shine she couldnt talk to her mother or
father or little brother about this ever-
increasing fear that was seeping into
her bones she left the house and walked
quickly taking deep breaths as she
reached blairfields main street she saw
little groups of people standing about
talking excitedly only one or two of
the stores had opened as yet but there
were more people on the sidewalks than
was usual at noon they nodded a good
morning to eileen as she passed then
turned to resume their fevered discus-
sion

  in front of the drug tore there was a
larger group eileen stopped and edged
into the fringe around an old woman
who was talking in a high thin cackle and
holding her listeners spell-bound the first
sentence eileen heard made her heart
stand still

  bewitched yes you dont believe
it heh but you must believe now i re-
member sixty years ago when leadvilie
was bewitched strange things happened
and men dropped dead at their work the
whole town soon felt the curse men
were afraid to work and they couldnt get
any money when they found the witch
they burned her then they could work
again blairfield is bewitched no man
will set foot in that haunted shaft blair-
fiew is doomed

  doomed a bystander echoed the
word stupidly

  yes doomed-to waste and die
doomed unless you find the witch

  eileen caught her lip between her teeth
to stifle a cry and walked quickly away
as she walked the words kept echoing in
her mind find the witch    find the
witch

  the people of blairfield were simple
close to the soil many of them were only
one generation removed from the peas-

ants of an old country whose lore was
woven around strange tales of little folk
and fairies and leprechauns handed down
from the time of the druids-and so
strongly a part of their consciousness that
centuries of christianity could not eradi-
cate it none among them would deny in
his own heart that certain families had a
banshee an evil spirit that wailed out-
side the house three nights running whet
a member of that family was marked foi
death they prayed to god but over theii
shoulders their eyes were peeled and their
ears attuned to another groups of spirits
that recognized neither god nor man

chapter four

dancers in the forest

fthe family was seated at the dinner
table that night waiting for the head
of the house to come home eileens eyes
kept straying across the table to study the
face of her sister nancy mrs gannon
looked tired and nervous and little ten
year old neil was chattering about the
topic that was the paramount subject of
conversation in every home in blairfield

  haunted little neil piped his eyes
round the mines haunted and nobody
dasnt go near it the ghost will strike
them down dead

  neil eileens voice was not quite
steady dont go around repeating such
nonsense cackling old women try to ex-
plain everything by blaming it on the
spirits you wait until dad comes home
and ask him

  but they do say that all over town
mrs gannon offered its not just the
old women its the men too the young
men johnny omarra was one who saw
the apparition and hes not a lad to be
easily frightened

  boy neil exploded johnny
omarra yanks out his gun and-bang
the old ghost-
the girl who loved pain



  neil stop please eileen cut him
short her eyes probed nancys face for
the barest sign of a reaction she even
engaged nancys glance switched to look
at nancys right shoulder then back mean-
ingfully to her sisters face but the play
of glances seemed to mean nothing to
nancy she just sat there her small face
in repose her large eyes that slanted up
a bit at the outer edges dark blue pools
of innocence

  paddy gannon came into the house
with a bang of the door and a noisy clump
of his big boots he marched through the
diningroom to wash at the kitchen sink
through the splash of the water his voice
carried through to the family in the next
room

  mary you get ready and get neil
ready to take the eight oclock train for
reading in the morning youre going to
stay with your sister for a few days
whats that paddy mary gannon
asked in a startled voice

  aw gee dad neil protested i
wanna stay here and see what happens
about the ghost-

  oh you do mr gannon stamped in
and took his place at the head of the table
youre going to reading with your
mother young one and ill hear no more
of your lip he turned to his wife you
get ready this is no place for kids or
women with weak hearts do you know
what the whole towns talking about 
theyre saying the mine is haunted its
the spirits who are to blame for the trou-
ble ill show them whos to blame they
wont go near the shaft-and you know
what that means starvation that will
come so quick we wont have the strength
to pull ourselves out of the way to die
haunted it may be by all the evil spirits
in hell but well work it just the same
and there will be bad days  so you
and neil go stay with your sister

  why cant we all go mrs gannon

asked plaintively theres nothing here
now but a bare living made by sneaking
out coal in the dead of night trouble
all the time secret societies and wearing
white bands on your arms so you wont
shoot down your neighbor its not ever
coming back paddy blairfield is-

   cackling like the old wives in the vil-
lage eh  gannon barked do as i say
eileen and nancy can look after me and
the house and ill look after the mine
haunted or not    serve the food
mary

nphere was a tension a harsh dis-
cordant note that seemed to vibrate in
the air unlike the usual harmonious home
life of the gannons mrs gannon looked
scared and her hands trembled visibly
even little neil appeared to sense the
change-the sinister feeling of foreboding
that hung in the room like a fog his
strident young voice was dropped to a
hushed whisper

   as eileen studied the guileless smile on
her younger sisters face a cold chill raced
down her spine and the small hair
prickled on the back of her neck it was
nancy not the talk of the haunted mine
who had by some strange means deliber-
ately charged the air with an ominous
portent-and she was enjoying the result
her smile said so

  nancy eileen called sharply dont
look like that stop it 

  nancy looked at her sister and smiled
even more sweetly

   eileen clenched her hands until the fin-
gers were numb and shut her mouth
tight she mustnt let this wild spirit of
discord that suddenly permeated the house
draw her into its whirlpool why did
nancy delight in making people afraid
eileen excused herself and went into the
kitchen it seemed that nancys smile had
a slightly derisive quality as she watched
her sister leave the room


terror tales

  that evening paul savage came to call
mrs gannon was upstairs with neil get-
ting ready for their visit to reading mr
gannon had gone out wearing the white
brassard of the silents on his arm nancy
was sitting on the front steps watching
a full moon come up to paint the coun-
tryside with quicksilver

  paul and eileen sat side by side in the
living room paul covered the girls hand
with his

  eileen why do you keep puttjng me
off is it because of omarra

  my mind is filled with other things
paul terrible disturbing things some
baleful influence seems to have settled
over all of as

  i know paul said ive heard the
talk thats going on around town that
the mine is haunted and all that rot but
its dangerous talk more powerful than
any sensible propaganda we know there
arent any ghosts in that shaft but as long
as people think so youll get no sense out
of them anything is apt to result from
a wild story like that i even went down
the shaft myself looking for the ghost

  but nobody can prove it isnt haunt-
ed eileen said i know i shouldnt be-
lieve those fantastic stories but there are
a number of things i dont want to be-
lieve fve been fighting them off reject-
ing them as impossible but they persist-
and im terribly worried i cant even tell
you paul what they are

  it would be better if you did paul
coaxed gently

  eileen shook her head and they sat for
a moment or two in silence holding hands
the girl started suddenly and a chill tre-
mor ran through her frame from some-
where outside came a weird half human
cry a wail that lingered like the echo of
a soul in torment eileens fingers locked
around pauls hand

  what-what was that

  some dog baying at the full moon
paul smiled

  no eileen turned a tense face
toward paul no i heard it last night
too just like that paul ive got to tell
somebody- she jumped to her feet
wheres nancy

  she was outside sitting on the front
steps admiring the full moon paul said
i guess shes still there

  eileen ran for the front door and flung
it open the moon drenched the country-
side with a wan mysterious light the
front steps were carpeted in its glow but
they were empty nancy was not out
there eileen stood by the door and called
several times paul came out and stood
by her side suddenly she turned to him

  paul we must find her i she seized
his lapels with both hands we must
find nancy

  but where did she go paul asked
where will we look

  eileen started down the steps dragging
paul after her by the hand come quick-
ly weve got to find her   paul where
does old seamus ocalahan live you
know the strange hermit 

up in the woods beyond the ridge
some place paul said but you dont
think nancy would be there do you
oh i dont know-but lets try if
you only knew what im afraid of   

rrhey stumbled through the woods
climbing the slope to the ridge where
old seamus ocalahan was believed to
live in a cave the bright moon made
their path easy to find but eileens haste
made her feet unsteady at the end of
twenty minutes she paused to get her
breath and leaned weakly against paul
savage

  its nancy paul dear i cant even
think of you until i find out whats wrong
with her

  paul patted her shoulder understand-
ingly ill help all i can darling
the girl who loved pain



  a little farther on they came to a clear-
ing the grass silvered like the surface of
a lake by the moonlight paul seized
eileens hand held her fast

  look

  eileen stood there by pauls side in the
shadow of the rim of trees and blinked
her eyes unbelievingly at what she saw
in the clearing old seamus ocalahan
was standing straight as a graven image
in the center of the clearing the moon
making his long white beard a cascade of
silver two figures danced around him
in a wide circle one following the mo-
tions and gyrations of the other both
figures were snow white one was a beau-
tiful young girl nude as a nymph of the
forest the other was a great white goat
the goat was dancing on its hind legs
pawing with its front legs as a dancer
keeps the rhythm with his hands and
arms

  nancy eileens voice was a choked
whisper

  yes paul said slowly nancy

  eileen started forward but he held her
back wait he said thats marvelous
barbaric-beautiful 

  eileen tried to break away from him
paul are you crazy too thats my sis-
ter nancy dancing out there naked in the
moonlight-dancing with a goat in front
of a crazy old man paul ive got to
stop her

  wait paul held her his eyes gripped
by the strange sight graceful as birds
on the wing smooth and supple as fish
gliding in water the goat and the girl
danced in a smaller circle each time clos-
ing in around the still erect figure of the
old man with the silver hair and beard

  as they watched a strange music
seemed to come from nowhere a lovely
pulsing rhythm that was part of the dance
and the moonlight barely audible faint
but clearly defined

  paul eileen begged let me stop

her dont let her do that mad pagan
dance there-without any clothes-in the
moonlight

  reluctantly paul walked by eileens
side as they left the fringe of trees and
started across the clearing old seamus
ocalahan unfolded his arms and clapped
his hands once the faint music stopped
the great white goat dropped to all fours
and trotted off int the woods nancy
stood there unashamed in her natural
state and watched them approach

  eileen stood before her sister probing
her face nancy smiled it was beauti-
ful she said wasnt it beautiful
where are your clothes eileen de-
manded

  clothes oh yes nancy walked
straight and poised as a young goddess
to the edge of the wood where her clothes
lay in a heap

   paul savage his eyes still filled with the
wonder and beauty of it touched old
seamus ocalahan on the arm the mu-
sic-where was it coming from

  the old white-bearded man spread his
arms it is always there all around us
it only grows louder when we need it
eileen holding her sister by the hand
was calling paul hurry lets go home
please

  paul joined the two sisters and they
started off through the woods in the di-
rection of home eileen was sobbing au-
dibly nancy was walking proudly grace-
fully once at a tight comer of the path
nancy turned her head and looked up at
paul she smiled sweetly the moonlight
showing every contour of her lovely
young face it was like a childs no more
self-conscious than when he had seen her
doing the naked pagan dance a short time
back paul looked back over his shoulder
the clearing was still there like a pool
in the moonlight but the old man with
the silver hair and beard was gone gone
too was the great white dancing goat


terror tales

  but a dark figure appeared at the far
edge of the clearing a man was cutting
across the edge of the clearing toward
the dense woods the moon was so bright
paul had no difficulty recognizing john
omarras burly figure with its charac-
teristic truculent stride

  now where did that bird come from 
paul asked himself was he hiding at
the far side of the clearing all the time
nancy was dancing  he must have been
why should he hide and sneak away
after  i think its about time i told eileen
a few things i know about that lad

  hurry paul please eileen called
from down the path im frightened

daul turned and hurried to catch up
with the two sisters they were al-
most home when a noise on the path be-
hind them made paul turn to look com-
ing toward them plainly visible in the
light of the moon was an old woman
she moved quickly despite her hunched
shoulders and bent frame a grey shawl
with long fringe covered her head and
the upper half of her body as she ap-
proached she made a cackling noise and
struck the ground before her with her
cane

  as the path was narrow and the old
woman evidently in a hurry paul stood
aside to let her pass the old woman
passed him without a glance and stamped
up even with nancy and eileen

  ha her shrill cackle awoke echoes
in the wood the changeling her
bony finger was extended toward nancy
almost touching the girls face with its
hooked nail

  nancy stopped walking and looked
at the crone with a half-pitying expres-
sion eileen pushed the old woman away
go away you crazy old idiot dont ever
call my sister that name

 she is she is the old woman beat
the ground with her stick i was there

at her birth your mother knows she is
a changeling i have seen her with old
seamus ocalahan laughing at tragedy
sitting on headstones in the graveyard i
saw her tonight when she danced with
the goat in front of that old he-witch
seamus ocalahan shes no child born
of woman and shell bring bad luck and
sudden death to them as lives with her
and are close to her

  paul savage took some money from his
pocket and pressed it into the old womans
hand you didnt see a thing take this
and get good and drunk and have your-
self some more hallucinations

  she closed her bony talons over the
money held it close to her face to look
then shuffled off bobbing her head paul
turned to the two girls lets wait a lit-
tle while and let her get a start half
crazy half drunk you mustnt feel hurt
at what she said nancy

  i was just thinking naney said soft-
ly how odd and thrilling it would be to
find out one was a changeling not the
child of mortal woman but an ageless
spirit that comes back to the earth every
century or so

  stop it nancy eileens voice was
hoarse dont talk like that youre be-
ing silly youre the natural daughter of
your mother and mine youre my very
own sister and i wont have any crazy old
hag calling you things like that

  from far up the path as if she had
heard came the old crones voice crying
out in a brittle cackle changeling-
changeling 

        chapter five
        call of the banshee

ftjhe residents of blairfield were
frightened something had happened
to call a curse down upon them that was
unanimously agreed the mine that put
food in their mouths and clothes on their
the girl who loved pain



backs was haunted-bewitched the curse
was reaching out to envelop them all
soon the pinch of want would be added
to the vague apprehension of the curse of
the mine no more trucks rolled at night

  paddy gannon talked himself hoarse at
a meeting of the silents but not one man
among them would join him to enter the
shaft not even johnny omarra for
johnny had seen the specter with his own
eyes the women folk backed their men
dont go near that shaft tis cursed
and be sure of that

  and an old crone leaning on a crooked
stick and holding her fringed shawl
around her bent shoulders with taloned
hands shuffled up and down the street
stopped at stores and houses everywhere
she cackled the same awesome story
there was a changeling in their midst
a thing in human form not a child of
woman but a creature of the spirit world
walked among them daily posing as
paddy gannons own daughter it was
but no natural daughter at all at all a
changeling

  paddy gannon heard the gossip and
took his pretty daughter by the hand he
brought nancy around to father doyles
house and held his broad thumb on the
priests bell until an aged housekeeper
opened the door

  is his reverence in gannon de-
manded id like to see him if he is
yes the old housekeeper was hesi-
tant i dont know-

  hell see me im sure

  gannon pushed in still holding nancy
by the hand he walked into the hall and
a gentle voice called from the front room

  in here paddy gannon the shades
were drawn and the room was in dark-
ness gannon halted on the threshold
are you in the dark father

  im afraid i am paddy gannon
father doyle said gently a few hours
ago i lost the sight of my eyes dr

akers was here and will be back there
seems to be no reason for it but i am
blind enough of that then can i do
something for you 

  blind paddy gannons booming
voice dropped to a whisper god pre-
serve your eyes father but ive brought
my daughter nancy theres a cruel ru-
mor going around the people are say-
ing my daughter here is a changeling
what can we do to stop this terrible
talk

  come here my child father doyle
said can you see me in the dark  give
me your hand there you arent going
to let this cruel talk make you bitter or
envious-are you  because we know
there is no such thing there is only one
spirit and that a benevolentone only
man is cruel and wicked

  oh i dont mind father nancy said
sweetly i think it would be thrilling to
be a spirit not bound by the shackles of
this earth

  all youth feels that way my child
the priest said now go outside please
i want a word with your father

  after a moment the priest asked has
she left the room paddy gannon
yes father

  she moves so lightly one might well
believe her to be a spirit father doyle
said with a smile in his voice send her
away paddy gannon to a good convent
some place in the country where live and
growing things abound the good sisters
will know what to do to shape that nim-
ble mind without breaking her spirit but
send her away because these good people
of blairfield can be very cruel

nhhe word went around that paddy
gannon had taken his daughter nancy
to see the priest to have father doyle
drive out the devil that possessed her but
before he got there father doyle had
gone blind


terror tales

  the devil had closed the eyes of god

  even on the street now people talked
in awed whispers nancy gannon walked
down the main street and people stopped
as if turned to stone at her approach
mothers pulled their little children out of
the way as if the devil himself was abroad
even the dogs seemed to sense the fearful
isolation and slunk out of her way in
the old days they told each other she
would have been driven out of town as a
witch maybe even burned

  all of it had no effect on nancy she
walked as if in a world of her own and
her very manner of going whipped the
people into a frenzy of hate she was no
real daughter of paddy and mary gan-
non she was a child of the devil-and
the curse that held blairfield in its grasp
was her doing nancy went her way
smiling sweetly a faraway look on her
lovely elfin face

  eileen gannon was tearful and more
than a little frightened as she talked to
paul savage what can i do paul  the
whole town is calling nancy a spawn of
some evil spirit

  vicious stupid peasants paul
growled

  but paul eileen stammered she
does such strange things you can hardly
blame them she sneaks out at night and
meets seamus ocalahan she was there
when the cave-in killed eddie dwyer
the night the ghost was seen in the shaft
and joe dixon fell to his death she was
gone all night-and in the morning her
feet were bruised and black and she had
a strange wound in her shoulder maybe
this crazy old man has something to do
with these awful events maybe he is in-
fluencing nancy to do things that are
connected in some way with these trage-
dies

  seamus ocalahan is a bit cracked
paul told her but hes not the one to
bring the trouble that holds this commu-

nity in its grip right now ive a theory
of my own and dont worry about
nancy shes a rare and lovely creature
such grace and beauty-to be born and
reared in blairfield-

  stop it eileen screamed ever since
you saw her dancing naked in the moon-
light youve done nothing but stare at
her and follow her with your eyes isnt
it bad enough that my own sister is be-
witched but you have to fall under her
spell

  eileen youre hysterical ill show
you-

  please go eileen begged i cant
stand any more dont come back ever
you-you too are coming under the spell
i can see it feel it go for keeps and
forever first she  bewitched john
omarra-now its you

  you need a little rest paul said ill
see you tomorrow

  no eileen slammed the door behind
him and leaned weeping against the wall
never come back there wont be any
tomorrow

  paddy gannon was talking to a group
of grim-faced men at a meeting of the
silents he was using strong words in a
strong voice were they going to sit down
and wait for starvation were they go-
ing to let their wives and kids starve
with good coal ready for the pick be-
cause some old crones had said there was
a curse on the mine

  im going in there tonight he shout-
ed and im going to get coal and if
theres a man among you with the guts
of a louse hell go with me-and the rest
of you can stay home and tell your beads
and starve like rats

  when he climbed the hill a little later
fifteen men were behind him others were
getting the trucks still others carried
rifles and side-arms to stand guard while
the shift worked   
the girl who loved pain



uileen gannon stood in her room
with her back to the door and watched
her sister nancy get ready for bed when
the younger girl had retired eileen turned
the key in the door and began to undress

  youre going to sleep beside me arent
you eileen  nancy asked

  yes of course eileen tried to keep
her voice steady why not

  because everyone else is afraid of me
everyone in the world mother took neil
away and father wont stay in the house
the people in town draw away from me
-but you arent the least bit frightened
are you

  of course not eileen was trembling
she got into bed and reached out to ex-
tinguish the bed light but halted her hand

  it is strange to see fear on peoples
faces nancy said it gives one an ex-
ultant thrih    what would make you
twist your face in fear eileen the
younger sister moved close and looked
into eileens eyes

  eileen steeled herself against showing
any emotion she tried to smile at her
sister suddenly there came the weird
half-human cry she had heard on the two
previous nights it seemed to come from
the yard outside the house its ghastly
timbre seemed to run up and down her
spine like needles as it climbed the regis-
ter to a wail of torment

  she sat bolt upright in bed whats
that

  nancy laughed gleefully your eyes
showed fear stark uncontrollable fear
your naked terrified soul was in your
eyes the way a person looks when death
stares them in the face it is marvelous
thrilling she edged close to eileen
soon i shall see that look in your eyes
again i know it-soon

  but that noise eileen muttered
that dreadful sound

  thats the banshee nancy shrilled
fthree nights it has wailed    and

that means death she bounded out of
bed and stood on her bare toes as if
poised for flight her head was thrown
back her eyes alight with rapture the
banshee

  eileen covered her face with her hands
then by sheer force of will pulled them
away and looked at the weird tableau of
her sister standing with outstretched arms
head thrown back for a split second it
looked to eileen as if a huge white bat
wings spread stood there instead of
nancy resolutely she got out of bed and
approached nancy

  go back to bed nancy youre hys-
terical but sfie couldnt keep her voice
level and the nerve in her body tingled
so that she walked jerkily

  nancy lowered her head and stared at
her sister then as eileen drew close
nancys arms came out toward her went
around eileens shoulders tense and
shaken eileen went a little limp as she
sagged she felt nancys fingers slide up
and close around her throat

  through a haze she heard nancys
voice i have heard the banshee call
i must go  

  when eileen recovered from her faint
nancy was gone

chapter six

death is a nymph

taul savage responded at once to
eileens frantic telephone call as he
drew up to the front of the house in his
small car eileen was standing on the
porch she ran down the steps and seized
pauls arm in her two hands nancy has
gone again we must find her

  do you know where she went

  no but lets try the mine paul she
acted like a mad person we must find
her and bring her back

  all right paul started the car but
its dangerous to be sneaking around the


terror tales

mine at this hour of the night the men
are working up there and theyll shoot on
sight

  i know it eileen said in hushed
tones she only had her nightgown on
if she goes up there they might think it
has something to do with the ghost that
is supposed to be haunting it they might
kill her in the darkness before they see
who it is hurry please you know how
excited they all are

  right paul savage guided his car
out of the village and up the hill to the
dark shaft of the blairfield mine he
took a short cut over a bumpy road as
they neared the top of the rise as they
bounced around a curve his headlights
picked out something that flashed white
in the darkness he stood on his brakes
what was that

  it was nancy eileen gasped im
sure it was over there by that wooden
shack

  paul savage took a flashlight from the
pocket of the car and got out come
on he told eileen that shack is an
air vent to number one tunnel well soon
see if that was nancy

  the two left the car and ran across
the field to the little wooden shack it
was unlocked and paul directed the beam
of his flashlight inside as he swung the
door open the grating that covered the
hole inside was leaning against the wood-
en side of the little shanty

  dont tell me paul said slowly she
couldnt have gone down that vent

  she must have eileen insisted i
saw her come in here

  paul knelt and played his light down
the vent a hole about four feet in diam-
eter roughly shored with heavy planking
there are footholds in this thing he
said but i still cant imagine-

  she went down there eileen insist-
ed shes gone down there where the
men are working theyll see her white

nightgown in the dark and shoot her
paul weve got to go down and find her
im another one they dont want
around here paul said ruefully theyd
think i was spying for the company and
give me the business-but here goes ill
go down first and give you a light

  he switched the light off and let him-
self down the vent feeling with hands
and feet for the iron footholds that had
been driven into the shoring the vent
sloped off around hard rock and was nar-
rower at that point then it widened
again eventually his feet struck hard
surface he flashed his light again and
saw that he was near the end of a tunnel
above him he could hear eileens prog-
ress down the vent shaft he played the
light for her and the two of them stood
in the tunnel black as the coal it sired
except for pauls flashlight

  she must have gone this way paul
said come on

there was a narrow gauge track
along the floor of the tunnel and the
footing was uncertain so paul kept the
light on the ground before them they
approached a bay and paul stopped sud-
denly did you hear that noise

  yes what was it eileens voice
was a hushed whisper

  the men are working number three
vein the next below on this shaft paul
told her its about one hundred and
fifty feet down the vein below that is
flooded because the pump hasnt been kept
going they must have stopped working
because the lift bucket isnt moving
but that noise eileen repeated it
seemed to come from right ahead in the
tunnel

  i know paul said and nobody is
working up on this level maybe its
nancy come on he led her out to
the bay and around the shaft there was
no indication that a score of men were
the girl who loved pain



working right below them the vein ran
off at a tangent on the other side of the
bay eileen stuck close to paul and walked
with one hand extended touching his
back

  it smells very unpleasantly she said
almost gagging

  they are working without the exhaust
blowers to dean out the foul air paul
told her clean air comes down the shaft
but even at best its hard to exhaust the
bad air these men are taking chances-
but its that or starve thats why my sym-
pathies- he stopped talking and his
frame stiffened standing behind him
with her hand touching his back eileen
knew from his abrupt tenseness that they
had suddenly come upon something in
that dark underground tunnel he stood
there with the light directed straight in
front of him eileen moved so she could
see around him he tried to stop her by
an upflung arm but she had already seen

  propped up against the wall of the vein
in a half sitting posture was big paddy
gannon eileens father he was still as
the black-hewn wall behind him and his
eyes were wide open and staring-star-
ing up at them paul held the light on
the man sitting there so limp and still
like a collapsed figure in a wax museum

  rdad f eileen was on her knees before
him whats happened whats wrong

  hold the light paul gave the girl
the flashlight and moved her gently to one
side he knelt beside the slumped form
of big paddy gannon and felt for a
pulse then he placed his ear against
gannons chest and listened for a heart-
beat but lie knew from the touch of him
that paddy gannon was dead his flesh
was already cold clay although rigor
mortis had not yet set in he put his
hand behind gannons shoulders in an ef-
fort to straighten the grotesque figure
his hand felt something wet and sticky
as he pulled it away and looked at it in

the flashlights beam he saw it was cov-
ered with blood eileen saw it too she
let out a pitiful little cry and dropped the
hght

  paul turned quickly and reached for her
in the dark to catch her as she fell she
went limp in his arms gently he low-
ered her to the ground and began to fum-
ble around for the flashlight but it eluded
his groping fingers

  paul straightened up and his fingers
were unsteady as he probed his pockets
for matches there was no warning
sound but suddenly a light seemed to
flash at the back of his head the dark-
ness spun before him in a dizzy cone he
could feel himself falling losing con-
sciousness it was as if the roof of the
vein had fallen in on him as he slipped
into oblivion his last thought was so
this is what a cave-in is like  

clleen regained her senses slowly

    she was coughing and gagging and
the darkness was around her like a thick
black blanket she began to struggle to
her feet as she remembered the events
just before she had fainted she was in
the coal vein with paul looking for
nancy-and they had found her father
dead and there had been blood on pauls
hand as he pulled it away from her fa-
thers body she snapped alert utter and
complete silence except for the regular
drip of water somewhere

  paul she called quietly at first
then as the only response was the
choked-off echo of her own frightened
voice she called again louder still no
response and she screamed his name again
and again only to have it beat back at
her like the mocking taunt of a hundred
fiends hidden in the blackness her head
turned first one way then another try-
ing to make out some object in one di-
rection she thought she caught the flicker
of a light


terror tales

  she stumbled over the rough floor of
the tunnel toward the gleam of light the
narrow-gauge track tore one shoe off but
she stumbled on unheeding the tunnel
made a turn and her hands fumbled along
the rocky wall following it then she
came upon the light and she stood
frozen with horror her senses refusing
to accept the scene

  standing in the middle of the tunnel
was her sister nancy still clad only in
her white nightgown nancy was holding
a coal oil torch in her left hand holding
it aloft so its yellowish flame licked at the
roof of the vein and in her right hand
nancy gripped a long knife-and its
bright blade was smeared red with blood

  nancy

  nancy came toward her sister slowly
holding the torch out before her in its
dancing light eileen could see nancys
face plainly it had a strange expression
one of almost childish delight and her
voice when she spoke was like the
pleased gurgle of a little girl

  ah you are afraid i can see it now
your face is all knotted and your eyes-
they stare so they stare like my fathers
eyes stared when he knew he was dying
all life is dull until the moment of death
then comes the thrill-the only real thrill
in the world the thrill of meeting
death 

  eileen tried to speak but her tongue
was numb she tried to pray but her
mind was in the throes of a terrible agony
that blotted out all reason nancy is
mad voices shrieking inside her said
she is not your sister she is a fiend in-
carnate she killed your father with that
awful gleaming red-smeared knife she
can kill because she has no soul she is a
fiend-and now she is going to kill you
she is going to plunge that knife still
smeared with your fathers blood into
you    just so she can see your eyes
when you die

  her knees gave way and she knelt help-
lessly before the slim young girl who
smiled like a child but held a murderous
knife upraised

  dont pray eileen nancy said soft-
ly it will do no good i do not like
prayers they are the moanings of weak
mortals maybe when you die you will
become a spirit as i am a spirit you
will be happier

  nancys face took on the reddish glow
of the torch and the crimson smear on the
bright knife seemed reflected in her eyes
she moved closer eileen tried to shut
her eyes but a strange fascination held
them wide and staring before their ter-
rified stare nancys figure appeared to
float toward her like a wraith-a mur-
derous specter red-stained with human
gore

chapter seven

hell underground

taul savage struggled back to con-
sciousness with the strange feeling
that somebody was calling his name far
off his head vibrated with pain and
when he touched the back of it with his
fingers he felt a large swelling cut across
the top he remembered thinking he had
been struck by a cave-in but he was not
hemmed in by rock or soil he felt about
him in the pitch blackness then called
eileens name there was no answer his
head spun and breathing was difficult
standing erect paul braced himself and
took a deep breath

  smoke

  the unmistakable pungent smell of
smoke permeated the foul air of the vein
tunnel in the blackness it was even more
terrifying it rolled about him until he
thought he could see it in the dark he
could taste its oily yellow stench and feel
his aching eyes smart with it

  eileen was somewhere in that tunnel
thb girl who loved pain



she had been lying there in a faint when
the blow he believed to be a cave-in had
felled him scrambling holding small
paper matches in his fingers he found
the flashlight

  eileen was gone the crumpled form of
paddy gannon was there eyes still wide
and staring but the girl was gone the
flashlight showed drifting slow coiling
clouds of smoke somewhere in the ill-
fated shaft there was a fire

  calling the girls name paul hurried
toward the far end of the vein tunnel
ahead was a curve and beyond it voices
he rounded the curve and came upon a
scene like a picture of an ancient human
sacrifice

  eileen knelt head bowed on the floor
of the tunnel before her holding the
torch and the uplifted knife was nancy
the expression on nancys face was sheer
rapture she was staring at eileens face
with a gleeful concentration she did not
look up at pauls arrival he started to
shout then checked himself nancy in
this mood was dangerous the knife in
her hand was red with blood

  put down the knife nancy he said
quietly we must go the shaft is on
fire it is burning and we must go
naney took a backward step fire
beautiful red flames lighting die fright-
ened faces of men--men trapped by fire
fire is more beautiful than the knife
paul stalled inching close give me the
knife nancy we will go and watch the
fire the yellow smoke was getting
dense in the close tunnel seeping in clos-
ing around them like fog nancy started
to hand paul the knife a voice behind
him snarled

  give it to him point first plunge it
in his throat nancy watch his eyes as
he dies paul whirled to see john
omarra standing in the tunnel right be-
hind him a flashlight in his left hand and
a club in his right by the light of nancys

torch paul could see the murderous light
in johns dark eyes paul swung his arm
quicldy and threw his own flashlight
john omarra was too close to duck but
hi right hand swung the dub just as the
flashlight struck him between the eyes
paul dived and locked both hands around
john omarras right wrist

tileen was trying weakly to get to
her feet the smoke was blinding
and gagging her the torch nancy held
was losing its glare in a pall of creeping
smoke paul hunched his shoulders and
held omarra with both arms while john
hammered his face and head with his free
hand pauls head came down and he
closed his jaws on omarras right wrist
he bit down until he felt omarras flesh
give felt the bone in his teeth john
omarra gave a scream of agony and
tried to free his arm he let go of the
club and thrashed around like a wounded
tiger paul eould taste warm blood in his
mouth suddenly he unclenched his jaws
and smashed with both hands at the face
writhing before him in the smoke as
john omarra went down paul drove his
heel in his face kicked him savagely
ruthlessly until the man went limp on the
ground

  eileen

  yes the girls answer was a choked
sob

  the fire is in the shaft we must go
through it to reach the vent we came in
by give me your hand

  nancy suddenly came to life at the
word fire she darted past them holding
the torch aloft she disappeared down
the tunnel and around the curve paul
tied his handkerchief around eileens
nose and mouth and began to lead her
back along the tunnel

  near the bay where the main shaft
went down the smoke was thickest the
fire was down below where the men were


terror tales

working but the lift bucket seemed out
of order its cable was silent only black-
ness and the oily smoke showed in the
beam of pauls light a down draft at
the main shaft forced the smoke out in
smothering billows and drove it along the
vein paul held his breath gripped
eileens hand and pulled her after him

  pauls eyes were almost blinded and
his lungs were bursting when the open-
ing of the vent showed in his flashlights
beam he pushed eileen up the crude
ascent she was so weak he had to sup-
port her weight on his shoulders at each
step the air became clearer he could
breathe climbing fighting for breath
they made the surface toppled out of
the little wooden shack and fell forward
on the ground side by side

chapter eight

bum the witch

t ike a flash of lightning word hit
blairfield lights went on in houses as
the awful news was shouted from one to
the other trouble at the mine

  the curse had struck again at the little
band of men who had defied it to scratch
a little coal from the bowels of the earth
on foot and in tinny old cars the frantic
parade wound up the hill to the mine
torches flared and the crowd gathered
they could not go too close for foul
black smoke rolled in great billows from
the mouth of the shaft

  fire

  some of the men who had been working
on the shift gasped out the story with-
out warning the first stench of smoke had
smitten them without the usual precau-
tions it was every man for himself with
no facilities for fighting the fire or even
determining the source the men on the
second level were suffocated before they
could claw their way to freedom some
got up in the bucket but the vengeful

yellow and black smoke drove back all
who tried to reach the others ten men
trapped in that veritable hell while their
friends and families wailed and prayed
and screamed outside the mouth of the
shaft

  somebody raised an agonized cry
look

  nancy gannon and old seamus ocal-
ahan stood on the rise to one side of the
shaft their forms and faces were plainly
visible in the dancing torchlight the old
mans face was devoid of expression but
the girls was registering sheer ecstasy

  the changeling

  her standing there bubbling with joy
while her own father is in that pit of
hell

  hes not her own father shes no
child of the world shes the devils spawn
and the cause of our grief

  shes a witch

  the grief-maddened mob poured its
emotion toward this fresh target the
men and women began to call insults and
threats nancy turned toward them and
smiled

  somebody called if wed driven her
out of town wed have been spared this
curse

  drive her out now

  burn her burn the witch

  old seamus ocalahan stood between
the girl and the onrushing mob his arms
outspread no dont harm the child
shes done no wrong

  the old man was trampled underfoot
and great red stains showed on his silver
beard in the jumping light of the torches
as they swept him down to the ground
the girl backed away slowly at first then
she turned and began to run throwing
over her shoulder a look like a young doe
in the forest being harried by a pack of
dogs

  the part of the crowd that held back
at first leaped in their emotions whipped
thb girl who loved pain



by the chase they spread out their
torches making crazy jumping flares as
they ran they called blood-curdling
threats and goaded themselves by shriek-
ing words of abuse the blood lust of
the hunt was upon them the pent-up
fear and anger of days was finding its
vent they closed in behind the running
girl snarling like mad dogs 

taul savage and eileen gannon
lay about two hundred yards from
the mouth of the main shaft for some
minutes their labored and tortured breath-
ing was the only sound either uttered
then paul said you all right eileen
yes she answered fm feeling a
little sick and my eyes burn paul i cant
understand it all

  ive been working on all this trouble
at the mine paul told her in gasping
breaths old seamus ocalahan had
nothing to do with it any more than
nancy did i can explain it all to you if
want to listen

  yes yes but not now what are
they doing around the mouth of the shaft
why are they all running like that

  it must be the fire paul said there
must be men trapped down there
nancy was running with mouth open
now her eyes staring wildly the mob
snarling at her heels shrieked insane ex-
ultation as her gait faltered her fleet
young legs were trembling near exhaus-
tion ahead was a small clump of woods
she ran stumbling toward it the pur-
suing mob fanned and scrambled after
her she was trapped the little knoll
ended m an abrupt precipice with a sheer
drop of more than a hundred feet she
would have to stop at its edge then they
would get her

  the torches moved down more slowly
as the pursuers closed in they advanced
oa the little fingers of land raised above
the surrounding terrain the trap the

hunted doe was too frightened to see
they moved in relentlessly right to the
edge of the cliff a rabbit a small pure
white rabbit looked at them with wide
bewildered eyes but there was no sign
of the girl it was as if she had disap-
peared from the face of the earth    

  eileen and paul savage searched the
faces of the crowd looking for nancy
people paid no attention to them no
explanation of the chase was given they
did not ask they just kept looking half
fearfully through the crowd then some-
body told eileen that her father was one
of those who had been trapped in the
mine probably smothered at the mention
of her fathers name the horrible scene in
the mine tunnel rushed back to flood the
girls senses she slipped to the ground
in a dead faint when she opened her
eyes paul had carried her back a little
way from the crowd around the smoking
shaft

  ive been working on this tiling for
weeks he told her it wont make you
feel any better now that your father is
gone but the curse that had all these peo-
ple frantic was a deliberate frame-up
johnny omarra had made a deal with a
mob who wanted to take take over this
mine and bootleg coal but they knew
theyd never take it from the blairfield
crowd by force he framed this stuff
those accidents he used poor strange
nancy even started this fire but the fire
got out of hand i dont think he meant
it to i guess hell never come out now

  i was afraid it was really bewitched
eileen said and i was afraid that
nancy and old seamus ocalahan had
something to do with it

  he had nothing to do with it paul
told her and omarra just used
nancy

  paul do you think she killed dad
eileen whispered

  no im sure omarra did it your


terror tales

father must have discovered john was re-
sponsible for the dirty work nancy must
have come upon them just as he killed
your father omarra knew nancy was
strange so he gave her the knife to
frighten us away

  but she looked so horrible eileen in-
sisted she was going to kill me

  i dont think so paul said she
just wanted to see fear in your eyes lets
go home nancy is probably there by now
calm as anyone

tut nancy was not home when they
got there she was never seen again
the last anyone had seen of her was when
she had fled frightened before the mob
into that little patch of woods

  three days later eileen was getting
ready to leave blairfield for good she
was coming out of a store in the village
when an old woman stopped her the
same old crone who had called nancy a
changeling the hag bobbed her head and
cackled did you hear about mrs dow-
ney 

  eileen shrank back then asked civilly
what about mrs downey

  a little white rabbit came out of the
woods and hopped right into her kitchen
it must have been good luck because mrs

downey childless these sixteen years just
had a baby girl and she not knowing or
expecting one i was there when it was
born a pretty little girl with big blue
eyes that slant up at the outside corners
thats-very nice im sure eileen
hurried on to where paul was waiting in
his car

  whats the matter paul asked you
look as if youd just seen a ghost

  im afraid if i stay here i will she
said paul drive as fast as you can
and as far as you can there are some
things ill never be able to understand
and i dont think i want to-and never
never talk to me about anything that hap-
pened here just as long as i live

  still brooding about nancy

  she gave him a long searching look
no ive stopped brooding about nancy
its hard to explain-but nancy is off
my conscience now i dont feel that im
responsible for her any more

  paul breathed a sigh of relief thank
goodness thats cleared up

  eileen shook her head no it isnt
and it never will be but there are some
things i dont want to understand-and
thats one of them

  paul nodded amen

which could never produce such off-

 cleave my brain with their dagger-strokes
 and i despair of ever regaining my normal




terror tales

physique and health sometimes in my
sleep i seem to feel again the hideous
torpidity of mind the loathsome human
fluidity of bone and muscle that rendered
me an inert jellyfish shrunken to the
proportions of a child but science yet
may save me   

  we were celebrating my thirtieth birth-
day here at the old louisiana plantation
where our family the paynes have lived
for a century past on every hand the
grounds are guarded by a barrier of for-
bidding swamps through which a hard
road leads to various plats of high land
now cultivated by white tenants once
tilled by my grandfathers black slaves
during the year since grace and i were
married the old manor house had been
modernized in various ways and foremost
among improvements was a gleaming
white-tiled outdoor swimming pool de-
signed to take the curse off torrid summer
days

  when the scorching sun had dropped
behind a surrounding wall of moss-draped
cypress trees grace proposed a cooling
dip although our guest doctor hemerich
koop made some small objection soon we
coaxed him into a bathing suit and led him
to the brink of the inviting basin grace
ran to the end of the spring-board her
delieately molded form poised as lightly
as a mocking birds upon a swaying bough
arcing through the air in a clean dive
that sent drops sparkling upward she rose
to the surface laughing and called

  come in i its delightful

  then her face sobered as she floated
there regarding the two of us with
thoughtful eyes

t sensed the comparison she was

  making and knew the reason doctor
koop whom i had employed ostensibly
to manage a small private hospital upon
the plantation for the benefit of tenant
families but actually to safeguard the

health of my bride was one of her school-
day lovers whose doglike devotion had en-
dured through adolescent years as one
of an adoring dozen she had given his
aspirations no serious thought until with
college behind him and a profitable pro-
fession ahead he proposed marriage and
she told him it could not be

  with disarming candor she had con-
fessed that she wanted a husband whose
physique would match her own bodily
health and strength because she desired
numerous children and there must be no
heredity taints that might prevent the
growth of tall sons and lovely daughters

  koops years numbered the same as
mine but i stood six feet two in my
stockings and tipped the scales at two
hundred weight he was a scrawny man
of five feet four and a childhood injury
had left his back slighdy hunched be-
neath his bulging brow dwelt a brain
whose keenness mine probably never
would attain although i did well enough
at managing the estate

  hemerich koop also guessed the tenor
of  her thoughts smiling he said
heartily

  what a gorgeous pair of animals you
are in with you ralph and have your
fun ill sit and watch

  with the sense of something akin to
pity i plunged sympathizing with the
hopelessness of his plight yet selfishly
glad in the knowledge that his fondness
for grace would result in especially watch-
ful care that meant a great deal to a
young couple expecdng to raise a family
in the depths of a swamp forty miles
from die nearest city

  it meant more than that to me five
minutes later when a monstrous face was
thrust out of a clump of shrubbery a few
yards away and the idiot pedro began
smarling obscene spanish oaths which
frightened grace into a fit of trembling
hysteria
her suitor from hell



  following a final gust of vile curses
pedro hurled some curiously shaped ob-
ject which splashed into the pool near
where grace clung to me then he scut-
tled into the swamp before i could call
a servant to catch him

  i held my wife in my arms sitting upon
a bench beneath the pergola while koop
ran to the house for his small black bag
returning he gave her a sedative be-
tween us we strove to calm her fears in-
sisting that the half-wits outburst was
meaningless but still terrified she cried

  he has grown more bold it has a
dreadful meaning that old crone zell
mendez is slowly goading him to the
point of murder they mean to kill you
ralph because of the accident that
crippled him

  i laughed the idea aside but even hem-
erich koops dark-browed face betrayed
deep concern uneasily he said

  all the tenants talk of the threats zell
mendez makes against you they fear
her curses superstitiously they believe
that she is in league with the devil some-
times i wonder sorcerers have per-
formed strange deeds which science can-
not fathom

  for gods sake koop i exclaimed
you dont mean that you believe in such
twaddle 

  he smiled grimly not as witchcraft
if thats what youre thinking but we
live in a swamp ralph and i must con-
fess that some of the secrets of swamp
herbs and poisons handed down from one
generation of voodoo practitioners to
another have not yet been solved by the
medical profession did you read last
spring of the man in bay st louis whose
stature is slowly shrinking who has
been dwarfed to the size of a child from
a height of six feet not only is he said
to be suffering from a curse but similar
cases have been recorded in barbados and

in porto rico it makes one wonder-
angrily i seized the bottle of brandy
he had brought from the house and gulped
a steadying drink grace said tearfully
why should she blame you that old
old witch for an accident that was un-
avoidable  three people swore that pedro
mendez darted out of the brush squarely
in front of your car-

  forget it dear i said inwardly shud-
dering at the recollection of a stunning
impact the sickening crunch of flesh un-
der heavy wheels the screams of the
stricken idiot when my speeding roadster
felled him doctor koop did everything
possible for the poor fellow and neither
pedros curses nor his mothers will
mend his crooked legs nor harm us
hemerich koop was looking toward the
glassy surface of the pool

  what did he throw at you when he
was swearing there i saw something
queer splash-

  ill see standing on the brink i
scrutinized the white bottom saw a small
blue bottle lying in the deep end exuding
an inky cloud there it is ill fetch it
up

  i dived the immersion cooled my ex-
cited blood instantly but even as i en-
joyed the pleasant sensation blighting
fear struck home cooled met i felt
chilled to the bone my limbs seemed
frozen neither arms nor legs would func-
tion in a state of complete paralysis i
glided to the bottom the air in my lungs
slowly raised me to the top but i hung
face downward helpless by no force of
will could i command the movement of
a single muscle

  when my tortured lungs rebelled and
i could no longer forestall the gasp which
filled them with water in a drowning flood
i heard graces shrill cry of alarm echo
as from a great distance then a black
coma enfolded me


terror tales

the time which followed was marked
by vague periods of light and dark-
ness occasionally i realized that i lay
in a hospital bed that a doctor and a nurse
came and went that i had not drowned
but was alive

  days and nights passed like a blur of
delirium studded with moments of ex-
cruciating agony broken by terrifying
dreams in which the idiots face appeared
to leer at me as i suffered there while he
gibbered of escape from pain through use
of some exotie drug contained in a small
bottle of hellish midnight blue at last
after an eternity of nameless terror there
came a phase of clear consciousness yet
so weak had my strange illness left me
that i could not raise my heavy eyelids
and perforce without a sign of life lay
listening to the voices of doctor koop and
grace

  he is wasting away to death my
wifes anguished tone was sharp with
grief it is zell mendezs curse ralph
is doomed you cannot save him
now now my dear the doetor
chided dont give up hope so easily
he lives and while theres life theres
hope aplenty if only i could tell- his
voice thinned on a troubled note
whether this queer shrinkage is die re-
sult of a drug-or something worse-
youve said that before there was
near frenzy in graces cry you too be-
lieve it is a curse that old zell mendez
has bewitched him-

  nonsense koop snapped sharply
of course it must be the work of a drug
but unfortunately the small blue bottle
which pedro threw into the swimming
pool had quite emptied itself before i
went back to recover it analysis of water
from the tank produced no satisfactory
results because of great dilution we have
not yet discovered the nature of the
poison

  if zell mendez could be forced to

tell despair edged my wifes sweet
voice ive pleaded with her but she only
laughs showing her yellow hags teeth in
a gloating snarl calling down still more
terrible curses upon poor ralphs head
oh will he ever be conscious again  or
will he die 

  try as i might i could not open my
eyes nor give any sign that life was burn-
ing more brightly within me that all was
not lost grace came to the bedside e
felt the warm touch of her fingers upon
my cold and flaccid hand in iter stifled
sob there was a note of sheer horror the
reason for which i did not then compre-
hend

  somehow you must stop this horrible
thing hemerich she exclaimed at any
cost call in specialists to aid you use
every resource that money can buy before
it is too late

  my dear grace hemerich koop said
money wont help nor can any specialist
i am doing my best to influence the out-
come of this peculiar seizure and no one
could do more

  his words cheered me as i lay there a
motionless helpless hulk for i knew the
keenness of his brain his thoroughness in
seeking the solution of difficulties if only
he could contrive to ease the worries with
which grace was besieged

  they left the room together i heard
the door open and close then for hours
it seemed i was plagued by visions of
vicious faces leering the unwholesome
countenance of old zell mendez loomed
above the foot of my bed snaggle-toothed
wild-eyed stringy grey hair straggling
across her leather cheeks i thought the
broken hps mouthed venomous curses over
and over and never in life or death would
she forgive the accident that had crippled
her son

  pedros maglignant visage tormented
me after his mothers dimmed and faded
a moron at best he was pop-eyed and
her suitor from hell



pimply his forehead sloped straight
away in line with a long pointed nose
and his chin receded obliquely to form a
snouted face like a hogs after my car
had smashed his legs and left them but
flopping clubs upon which he stumped
about with the aid of two canes pedros
appearance was enough to frighten women
and children his witless tongue forever
drolled profane obscenity

  lying there in my torpid state seeming
to hear the foul threats he voiced sud-
denly i was obsessed with fear for grace
what if the idiot sought to vent his spleen
upon her alone in our big house save
for black servants she would prove easy
prey for him the thought shocked me
into wakefulness my eyes snapped open
they widened with consternation and my
jaw hung loose at sight of the ugly face
peering through an open window near my
bed

i hear you talking

  i meant every word of it he whis-
pered shrilly and why not now
youre no better than me

  filthy beast i rasped weakly if
i hear that youve so much as looked at
grace ill horsewhip you and should
you attempt to molest her ill break your
back with my two hands

  y-a-ah your hands look at em
and tell me how much breakin they can
ever do youll never get off that bed
alive dont you know that your finish is
all planned

  pedro loosened the screen and swung it
aside i thought he intended to clamber
in and murder me but a streak of stub-
bornness kept me from calling aloud for
help with all the force of my will i
strove to lift the hands he mentioned so
contemptuously but could not power-
less as a babe i demanded hoarsely

  what do you want what do you
mean to do 

  pedro grinned his eyes shining redly
like two mirrors of hate his subdued
laughter jangled

  ill do everything i said-after youre
dead she wont listen till youre gone
but now that you look worse than me
your pretty wifell let me love her once
youre out of the way

  a red haze of hate suffused my brain
and for a space i could not see clearly
then the spasm passed and i found him
leaning through the aperture balancing a
tiny blue bottle upon his palm

  take it pedro invited quick
death easy death without any pain ma
wanted me to slip it into your grub to
make sure you die but taint worth the
risk youre dyin now take it yourself
so your wifell quit cryin about you and
listen to me

  get out i raged go away from
that window before i yell for help ill
have you shot-

  pedro drew back hurriedly

  that aint no way to act he com-
plained after i came to do you a favor
here ill leave the bottle in this corner
nobodyll see it and youll want it soon
he re fastened the screen

  after a long gloating look at me pe-
dro disappeared a low-flung shaft of
light from the setting sun glinted upon
the blue bottle and i stared fascinated
wondering if in truth i might soon want
the poison

  why had the idiot said now that you
look worse than me   i remembered
doctor koops comment concerning a
strange shrinkage that puzzled him did
he mean my skin the wasting of my flesh 
i shuddered at thought of freakish hu-
man skeletons i had seen struggled in a
blinding effort to gain control of my limbs
almost succeeded

  after i had fallen back gasping upon


terror tales

the pillow a harrowing fear possessed me
something was horribly wrong i must
get up and away to grace   

  what the ensuing effort to rise cost me
in mental strain and mortal agony only
god can realize if there be such a thing
as actual power of mind over matter then
it was that which in the end gave me
command of my muscles again striving
to the point of deadly nausea beset in
every joint by dreadful pains which nearly
drove me mad at last i forced myself to
a sitting position swung my legs down
from the bed clinging to the white iron
framework i made an effort to stand
although at first my knees buckled miser-
ably

  dimly i perceived the door of a closet
across the room on hands and knees i
crawled to it seeking a robe or other
covering for my nakedness i reached for
the knob three times and failed before i
could draw myself erect swaying there
i found inside a suit of my clothes which
grace must have brought as a childish
means of bolstering hope that one day i
would wear them home dragging gar-
ments from the hooks i crawled back to
the bed again after a grueling ordeal of
rising and seadng myself i drew on the
dark grey trousers and managed to stand
dazedly i stared down at their absurd
length noting that the legs were at least
a foot too long i fumbling in the pockets
i found a familiar purse yes indubitably
they were mine turning a little then
i caught a glimpse of my reflection in the
glass of a window that was closed a cry
of horror burst across my lips at sight of
the revolting figure there darkly revealed

  a dwarfted and hairless monstrosity
my bald skull bulked far too large for the
scrawny neck and stunted frame which
supported it deepset eyes were gloomy
caverns beneath my brow my nearly
fleshless jaws were those of a deaths
head lips paper thin and tightly drawn

my broad shoulders had narrowed and
were hunched like those of a deformed
child my long and powerful legs were
shrunken to spindling bony shanks from
which the last vestige of strength was
swiftly ebbing

  staring at the odious reflected shape i
felt my reason sway loosing a render-
ing scream i toppled upon the floor and
sank into a bottomless abyss of blackness
in which my sufferings were extinguished
with the appalling slowness of creeping
death

tut i lived when next i knew that
deaths groping clutch had missed me
it was to find myself again reposing in
the hospital bed the voices i heard and
the spoken words dispelled an awful
lethargy which gripped my brain but did
not break the chains of weakness that
shackled my leaden limbs

  ah god i cant bear to look at him
it was my wifes despairing cry no
curse has done this it is the poison
i listened to her muffled sobs of horror

  doctor hemerich koop was speaking
but i could not distinguish the things he
said when my eyes flicked open i saw
that he held grace in his arms and was
whispering with lips pressed close against
her golden hair she broke away and
whirled to face him her cheeks flushed
with anger and dismay

  you dare say such things to me
while ralph lies dying-

  as well say dead my dear for soon
he shall be and even though i were to
keep him alive would you not choose me
small and ugly though i am in prefer-
ence to the jellylike thing which was once
a man  ah he is watching us see him
quivering there like a viscous blob upon
the sheet

 you demon grace screamed in
chattering frenzy fnot zell mendez-
but you you did this-
her suitor from hell



  and why not he stole your love
from me

  as though i ever could have loved a
hunched and evil creature

  i am a man koop thumped his nar-
row chest proudly i am active and
strong my brain is fine look now at
the one who thought himself superior is
not ralph payne a disgusting sight he
little resembles that father of tall sons
and lovely daughters of whom you
boasted

  grace approached on laggard feet and
stood beside my bed tears streaming
she touched my torpid arm my bony face
crying bitterly

  i love him his soul lives despite the
ruin youve made of his magnificent body
oh what have you done to him what
blight have you wrought

  doctor koop came near and hatred
glowed in his eyes as he grinned down at
me

  it was a master stroke he bragged
the strategy of using zell mendez and
her half-wit spawn as pawns in my little
game for days on end she voiced her
threats to all she met after the accident
there are fifty witnesses to swear that
she contemplated the murder of ralph
payne and made pedro help her plan it
now both are jailed accused of poison-
ing your husband by contaminating the
swimming pool and no one ever shall
hear of the clever operation that i per-
formed upon his throat

  grace stared and so did i my powers
of speech paralyzed as yet although my
tongue curled and twisted in an effort to
talk

  you operated on ralph why my
wifes eyes were round with terror oh
tell me what youve done to him is there
no cure

  i could cure him-but at a price you
may not wish to pay another might if
he were skilled in the science of the glands

and knew what i have done prevailing
upon pedro mendez to hide nearby and
toss a bottle of common poison into the
pool after frightening you i let ralph
drink of drugged liquor from a bottle i
brought knowing that wed have to rescue
him from his dive the numbing effect
of the drug i used is instantaneous that
gave me an excuse to bring him here to
the hospital with only a simple-minded
cajun girl to help i planted a globule of
metallic compound at the base of the para-
thyroid gland where it would immediately
create sufficient pressure to halt the
glands functioning the result as you
see was swift decalcification of his bones
a shrinking of stature a wasting of flesh
he is like a thing of rubber and jelly
now as death approaches

  but he could be cured  grace plead-
ed oh say that he can be saved

  of course by removal of the pres-
sure and with proper treatment in a mat-
ter of months he might regain his normal
size and health but who shall grant him
that boon my dear

  you shall hemerich you say you
love me you must be kind restore him
well forgive and forget stop this mad-
ness and use your skill to make him a
man again

  you heard my terms i mentioned a
price- koops smile was lecherous he
seized grace in his arms and sought her
lips the price is yourself-mine for al-
ways and you must answer now

tvtever shall i forget the play of tor-
turing emotions that swept over my
dear wifes face as she fought to submerge
her revulsion to find the courage to en-
dure an odious ordeal she gasped
what do you mean-for always not
after he is well

  if i grant him life koop said harsh-
ly it must be without you and he shall
never know at best his mind might not


terror tales

be restored completely it will do no
harm to make certain of that

  comprehending his horrible intention
to rentier me a witless hulk endowed with
life grace threw herself upon her knees
and pleaded piteously roughly koop
thrust her suppliant hands aside

  if i only wanted you now id take
you it must be of your own free will and
for always

  again weakening he put his skinny
arms about her and pressed his repulsive
lips to hers grace tore herself free she
struck him with her open palm and
dropped in a sobbing heap upon the bed
beside me

  let me die with ralph she moaned
dont touch me only let me die-
hemerich keeps swarthy face paled
greyly i knew then that he had ex-
pected victory failure seenaed to drive
him mad

  die never you fool ill keep the
pair of you alive so long as the spark can
be held within your rotting bodies you
shall endure the same operation grace
and in turn shaft become as he is bones
of rubber and flesh of jelly while your
brain melts in harrowing helplessness
if you love him so you shall lie beside
him and dream of the ecstasies that you
will know no more

  springing upon grace koop bound her
hands with a towel likewise her ankles
dashing out of the room he returned with
a hypodermic syringe and plunged the
needle into her arm soon my wifes
frenzied struggles ceased removing her
bonds koop leaned across her motionless
body and peered into my starting eyes

  you know i can read the suffering
there both must live to suffer endlessly
while i watch over you day by day and
laugh at two strong lovers who coveted
tall sons and lovely daughters t

  his harsh mirth echoed in the room
he opened the door and called

   addie come here

  a dull-eyed cajun girl appeared fear
written large upon her stupid features
koop exclaimed

  the lady is sick you must help me
operate

  he carried grace out the girl cast a
frightened look at me i thought her lips
moved in soundless pity that she felt an
urge to render aid but stark terror held
her captive and she followed koop obedi-
ently

  once more i set my mind to the task of
making the flesh obey if only i could
move roll off the bed crawl to the room
where grace lay helpless beneath his hell-
ish hands this time i could not my
greatest effort served only to elevate my
head a trifling way but in that brief in-
stant a downward glance encompassed
my shrunken legs and i groaned in trem-
bling horror the two limbs lay coiled
awry upon the sheet like rubber tubes in
which no semblance of bone remained
koop had spoken truly i was but a jel-
lylike blob of slowly liquefying matter
that was scarcely flesh the shock seemed
to disintegrate my brain and conscious-
ness faded

jo race was lying upon a bed which
had been moved into the room before
i awakened some one had turned me
upon my side so that i might see her there
when the torpor lifted a white bandage
encircled her throat and her eyes were
wide and staring both wrists and ankles
were caught dose to the iron framework
by broad straps to hold her prisoner her
quivering lips formed a whispered query
ralph can you hear me can you
speak 

  for long moments i fought the rigidity
of throat musdes then croaking word
grated across my dry teeth

  yes i hear oh god i see-

  he operated on me soon i shall b
her suitor from hell



as you are the dread sentence of doom
gushed out of her very soul a gulp of
anguish

  how long i gasped

  a week he said before the gland i
seriously affected oh there is no
hope-

  koops voice sounded at the doorway
his hateful visage was framed there
grinning

  oh yes there is my dear i might yet
reconsider-if within the week you de-
cide that life with me is preferable to liv-
ing putrescence

  i found the strength to curse him to
utter threatening prophecies of retribu-
tion doctor koop only smiled

  you have revived considerably as a
result of treatment last night while you
were unconscious i want you stronger-
that you may suffer morel while you lie
there waiting watching

  he stepped away to graces bed threw
back the coverlid tore her gown away
lust gleamed in his hot eyes but hunger
for vengeance and the will to torture pre-
vailed he turned aside muttering
wotchmg seeing her lovely fertn
shrivel and shrink therell be wrinkles
and bonr angles where you knew curves
and tender maidens flesh love will be
smothered in revulsion as you watch each
other disintegrate and become two
dwarfed disgusting things with only
brain cells living

  koop went out saying as he departed
soon the treatment will make you rav-
enously hungry payne in an hour or so
hi bring you food and feed you with my
own hands for you must livei to see
and suffer his brittle laughter echoed
from a distance

  grace was weeping i could think of
no cheering thing to say stupefied i lay
resigned to the inevitable but soon i
experienced a faint sensation of life of
circulation in the arm which lay crashed

beneath my body koops remark flashed
across my mind you will be stronger
the treatment last night- hope flared
faintly strong enough to move to crawl
to exhaust the last faint spark of life force
seeking aid for grace

  i thought of our isolated position in
the swamp then remembered the tele-
phone but the instrument in the outer
office might as well have been miles
away feverishly my frantic brain strug-
gled with the problem of what might be
done if i found some vestige of strength
restored my wandering gaze paused at
the nearest window an idea sprang into
being

  grace  i exclaimed there may be
a fighting chance if you eould free an
arm or leg try it

  pitifully she looked at me and shook
her head but i urged frantically

  try twist and try

  grace began to writhe to tug and
struggle faint moans of pain escaped
her tight-drawn lips as the straps cut
skin and flesh at last she said

  ive one foot loose but ralph i cant
do any more

  plant your heel against the wall i
cried push hard force your bed
against mine and shove me nearer to the
window its only a matter of inches-
grace succeeded in doing what i asked
our beds collided and the impulse of her
thrust skidded my cot against the window
sill rolling me upon my back as i made
a desperate effort in that direction ly-
ing there then i tried to move my hands
found new life m the finger tips but none
in my arms slowly gropingly nails
scratching at the bed linen and mind sav-
agely intent upon accomplishment i
dragged one hand in fractional jerks
across the sheet onto the window ledge
and seized the tiny bottle that pedro
mendez had hidden there

  the trivial muscular feat that followed


terror tales

exhausted me more than i can express
with the prize precariously clutched be-
tween thumb and forefinger i worked
my hand back by the power of fingertips
alone until it reached my body three at-
tempts i made to raise that left arm and
failed then like a crawling worm i
made it creep across my chest until it met
the other in a little while when the cold
sweat of weakness beaded my brow and
nearly all my strength was spent with
my right hand i laid the vial in graces
palm her fingers closed upon it
what-

  it means escape i exclaimed hide


  i dont understand

  her eyes sought mine i rolled my
head and whispered

   it is poison

octor hemerich koop came
later bearing a well laden tray his
forecast was correct i knew the pangs
of hunger but the viands he carried inter-
ested me less than the bottle of wine
placing the food upon a table he turned
to smile at grace and said

  youve hurt yourself struggling one
strap was poorly fastened why not agree
to my proposals and have them all off
my wife looked up at him long and
moodily one could scarcely recognize
her voice when chokingly she said

  i cant bear it to be like him oh
god i cant-

  you mean- doctor koop leaned
above her eagerly that you have
counted the cost of hopeless love for the
thing that he has become

  my love is dead she stormed hys-
terically i was faithful i was true but
ralph payne is gone there remains
only    that she swung her eyes
toward me and quickly looked away

  koop exclaimed then youll come to
me oh this is glorious

  awkwardly in his haste he fumbled at
the straps which bound her casting them
aside he caught grace in his arms and
helped her to arise

  my dear one my lovely one he
gloated always ive watched you
wanted you and now you are mine
with a shuddering sigh grace pushed
his pawing hands aside forced a shrill
laugh crying

  yours i shall be but dont ever call it
love its the price i must pay

  have it your own way he snapped
so long as you do pay

  dont be angry grace pleaded i
am upset and unnerved perhaps a little
of that wine-

  he snatched up the bottle smiling
again

  of course its just the thing 
pouring two glasses he raised one and
turned to me in mock salute

  now ralph payne youll have some-
thing more to watch heres to greater
suffering

  grace lowered the glass from her lips
face white as death exclaiming

  drink your toast to me have i not
deserved it

  koops countenance split in an evil
grin

  youre improving my dear well get
along famously

  grace took his glass half emptied and
gave him hers

  the better to seal our bargain hemer-
ich she cried and a laugh like an echo
from hell rattled upon her bloodless lips

  koop tossed off the drink at a gulp he
started violently a terrible tremor shook
his scrawny frame from head to foot
collapsing he screamed

  poison r

tvhe man expired before he struck the
floor grace crashed her glass against
her suitor from hell



the wall and swayed as though she might
faint

the door opened addie the cajun
girl stood gaping there

i watched through the keyhole she
whispered is he    dead 

dead i shouted relief strengthening
the voice in my throat executed just
as we planned it

he was a devil he put a curse on
you she mumbled stupidly

the telephone i gasped as vague
fears for the future flooded into my brain
help my wife to it addie quickly
we must lose no time

grace steadied herself hope flamed in
her eyes

  ill call doctor carondelet at new
orleans hell operate on us well both
be saved

  

  perhaps we shall be i am not yet well
but sleeping or waking my beloved is
always near the soft caress of her hand
the sight of her loveliness unimpaired
give me hope and courage when gaily
she measures the inches added to my
stature during the month and playfully
runs slender fingers through my newly
sprouted hair i feel sure that are the year
ends i will dare appear again in the
haunts of men as tall and muscular and
proudly fit as before i was stricken by
the shrinking death

the road went suddenly over a
high narrow trestle spanning the
gorge we held our breath while
negotiating it and then we saw the lights
of our destination

  groff hall private residence hotel or
whatever it might be it perched like an
eagles nest high on the crags with the
river-gorge in a hairpin turn almost sur-
rounding it eerie location indeed with


these wild lightless defiles slashed and
broken storm-swept by rain and wind
of gale force now the trail looped and
turned and then we came to the small
rocky top with the two-story rambling
stone structure before us the lights of
its windows were blurred yellow blobs
through the torrential rain whatever
sort of place it was it had to be our rest-

terror tales

go no further

  i pulled up under a porte-cochere our
radiator was boiling again the engine
was knocking violently when i shut it off

  ive liad enough i said as i climbed
from the car wherever we are-here
we stay

  if i had known

  good evening sir

  the voice by its very unexpectedness
was horribly startling edith my sister
gasped with a faint suppressed cry i
whirled to find a man standing at my el-
bow in the dimness here under the porte-
cochere roof i could see him as a tall
figure broad and burly he was without
hat and outer coat evidently seeing our
approaching headlights as we toiled up
the grade he had come out to greet us

  oh i said how do you do my
sister and i-were lost you-we hoped
this was a hotel-our cars running bad-
ly-were hungry

  he turned with a queer stooping ges-
ture as though peering at edith he said

  im dr emil groff a heavy gut-
tural foreign voice but there was a dig-
nified suavity about it a hotel he
aid well-not just that but you are
welcome come in the young lady must
be cold

  he left us standing on the threshold
of the open door while against my protes-
tations he carried in our two suitcases
we saw a dim hallway with electric lamps
heavily shaded a tall brown-haired
young woman in a maids uniform stood
watching us

  and suddenly there was the distant
ound of a girls laughter instantly
checked it echoed through the silent in-
terior and there was about it so eerie a
quality that edith and i stared at each
other wordlessly and the maid whirling
at the sound hurried instantly away

  dr emil groff came with our suitcases

  most horrible night my friend i

shall put your car away later were
short-handed tonight my nurse is on
holiday and my man went to chattanooga
for supplies i fear the storm may keep
him away for tonight

  what was this place a hospital a
madhouse i saw this dr groff now as
a man of perhaps forty a burly six-foot
fellow with a head of close-clipped black
hair-a smooth-shaven face of rugged
somewhat handsome features he stood
fingering a black eyeglass ribbon that
hung around his neck his dark gaze
from deep-set eyes under heavy black
brows seemed appraising me

  oh-yes i said awkwardly it cer-
tainly is a bad night

  i told him our name-baker and that
we were traveling from florida to chi-
cago he listened with a very queer
grave smile faintly pulling at his mouth
and abruptly he interrupted me

  well i am honored that you came
here mr baker we shall make you
comfortable-this storm no one could
travel these mountains a night like this
his gaze clung to ediths dark slim
beauty he added we are glad to have
you my dear young lady we will do
everything possible to make you happy
a madhouse here in this wild lonely
mountain fastness this man-himself
one of the inmates thoughts may run
wild very fast    edith took an invol-
untary step backward as though his
words were physically repelling and she
flung me a startled questioning glance

  then before i could speak he had
turned to me i understand you mr
baker his lowered voice and his bulk
momentarily excluded edith who was a
few feet from us your sister needs-
attention later we will discuss the de-
tails

t own that my wits were scattered
i aw the brown-haired maid in her
laugh and die



black and white uniform again standing
near us i stammered

  why-we dont want to intrude dr
groff i really thought this was a ho-
tel-

  my one wild wish then was to get edith
out of here storm or no storm

  hotel he said well-yes you
might call it that of course your stay
will be brief-supper only perhaps if the
storm diminishes when my man returns
i will have him fix your car he is a very
good mechanic

  the maid said shall i take them up-
stairs dr groff 

  yes millie just temporary rooms
they may leave after supper ill bring
up their luggage

  the maid touched ediths arm

  come miss she said it gently but
firmly as one would talk to a child

  and again groff was leaning close to
me

  naturally they dont like the idea of
permaneney thats almost always the
case

  edith the patient to be humored upon
her admittance here i smiled with re-
lief

  look here i said youve got us all
wrong dr groff is this a hospital i
didnt realize it i assure you theres
nothing wrong with my sister

  certainly this fellow was no madman
he saw that edith could not hear me
now-that i could not possibly be talking
for her benefit he looked startled and
disappointed

  he said i did not understand you
it is so almost impossible for any one to
arrive here by chance

  but we did i said and smiled a
sudden vague hostility had come to him
his gaze had an appraising suspicion in
it i added we wont intrude further
his suspicion seemed to vanish no
intrusion he said this is groff hall

we receive patients who are-depressed
melancholic shall i say my treatment
has proven very efficacious there is hap-
piness here

  certainly nothing very sinister for all
its weird morbidness i said i see-
well then if we might have lodging until
the storm is past

  of course he agreed my charges
are reasonable and we have plenty of
room-oh my wife dr agatha groff
this is mr baker and his sister not
patients-they were lost in the storm

  a woman in black had approached us
despite my polite endeavor to smile as
i took her extended hand an inward
shudder swept me the woman was of
indeterminate age certainly older than
her stalwart husband-a little hunched
thick-set figure no taller than my shoul-
der gorflla-like with long thick arms
he dress was stiff black taffeta with
white ruching around her short neck
where her head set down between wide
hunched shoulders the dress gave an
incongruous air of primness carried also
by her black hair streaked with grey
primly parted in the middle plastered
down and rolled into a knot at the back

  but it was her face that most startled
me sharp hatchet features  and for all
her smile now there was so intense a
malevolence in her face that i caught my
breath

  mr baker you are welcome-

  she had the same guttural accent as
her husband her hand gripping mice
was like a roughened scaly claw then
she turned to where edith stood gaping

  you are welcome my dear her
little glittering eyes seemed feasting on
ediths dark slim beauty she sucked in
her breath with an audible hiss why
my dear child-you are beautiful-beau-
tiful-

  we presently followed the maid up-
stairs edith gripped my arm


terror tales

  well go right after supper

  yes

rtthe noise of the storm was far
more apparent up here on the second
floor the slap and pound of the rain on
the roof was audible gusts of wind as
though this were a tropical hurricane
rattled the old building from end to end
a dim upper hallway confronted us with
a number of bedrooms opening from it
the maid turned to a closed door al-
most at the head of the staircase she
said this will suit you mr baker
two connecting rooms there is plenty
of choice we have only two other pa-
tients just now

  she had a quiet dignity this maid an
intelligent-looking handsome girl of about
twenty what could have been her dark
and tragic history that made her a part
of this wild place i have often wondered

  other patients i said were not
patients were leaving right after sup-
per

  as though the storm were hurling de-
fiance at my words there came a sudden
sizzling lightning flash and a crack of
thunder with it the lurid glare showed
through a window at the distant end of
the hall the electric lights of the house
simultaneously vanished so that for that
insant i saw the figures of edith and the
maid painted green-white and the de-
crepit hallway an inferno of glare then
the hall lights flickered on again the
thunder rolled away into the distance like
a grumbling retreating giant

  edith gasped good heavens that was
close

  we have bad storms in these moun-
tains sometimes the maid said she
stood with her hand on the bedroom
door her gaze on edith youre going
after supper youre not-sick

  no edith said and tried to smile
im not

  from one of these upper bedroom

near us now again came that eerie chill-
ing burst of laughter so dose to us-
it seemed two girls laughing behind one
of these closed doors laughter so queer
so wildly unnaturally strange that to the
listener there could not seem any quality
of mirth in it but only horror i saw the
maid stiffen she took an involuntary step
toward the sound then she changed her
mind and swung on us

  youre going right after supper
she was breathless with furtive lowered
voice on the nearby stairs dr groff
was starting up with our suitcases

  you do that the maid added swifdy
you-never mind the storm-you get
your sister out of here-

  yes i agreed i gripped her shoul-
der as i bent toward her millie tell
me-

  a bedroom door diagonally across the
hall burst open from it two young girls
came running the hall light shone on
their slim pink-white beauty their bodies
clad in brief filmy undergarments their
hair wildly flowing they staggered to-
gether into the hall clinging to each oth-
er wildly laughing in a paroxysm of ma-
cabre mirth then they saw millie as she
sprang for them

  we want mrs groff they screamed
where is mrs groff isnt it time
millie was struggling with them no
not time yet you go back you shouldnt
have done that you stop it

  she shoved them back into the room
and banged the door on them but their
wild screaming laughter still sounded
edith and i stood frozen gruesome un-
holy laughter what was this ghastly
thing 

chapter two

lurking fiend

tvto more than five minutes had
passed dr emil groff had brought
up our suitcases with his face stolidly
laugh and die



inscrutable ignoring that brief wild ap-
pearance of the two laughing girls in
the hall he had murmured a few words
to millie with a glance at the nearby
door behind which the girls now were si-
lent i caught a fragment of the maids
answer

  -locked them in

  then dr groff had come to our door
supper will be ready presently come
down soon

  he left us he and the maid descended
the stairs

  edith stood shuddering i took a look
around the two small bedrooms they
were meagerly but comfortably furnished
each had a single window and a door to
the hall and there was a connecting door
between them i peered from one of the
windows solid blackness with only the
wild rage of the storm but i could see
enough to realize that there was a sheer
drop from these windows down into the
canyon upon the brink of which the house
was perched

  those girls- edith murmured when
i went back to her

  whatever this macabre mystery i could
see no sense of talking about it heaven
knows edith was frightened enough

  ill get us out of here right after sup-
per i said

  then we heard a car arriving not the
manservant from chattanooga for as we
silently moved out to the head of the
stairs the visitors were visible down in
the lower hall dr groff and millie
greeting a party of three two men and
a girl one of the men was elderly grey-
haired he seemed ill he stood a mo-
ment then millie brought a chair in
which he sat down while the other man
talked with dr groff this other man
was young-in his thirties doubtless a
stalwart fellow with smooth black hair
the girl had taken off her hooded cloak
the hall light gleamed on her pale-gold

tresses she was small no older than
edith and extremely beautiful

  i thought suddenly of the way dr
groffs deformed hag of a wife had stared
at the dark slim beauty of edith was
this new arrival another possible victim

  an aura of wealth was upon these three
latest visitors they came upstairs in a
moment at the staircase head they
turned down the hall in the other direction
so that they did not pass our door but the
girls voice floated to us

  youre not too tired father

  we were presently ready to go down
to supper as we started it seemed that
amid all the noises of the outside storm
i heard footsteps pattering away in the
upper hall

  edith i wait here a minute

  the dim hall was empty but ten feet
or so beyond the locked door where millie
had shoved the two girls the hall turned
a right angle to the left into another wing
of the building i ran there the hall
beyond the angle was almost dark thirty
feet from me it seemed that i saw a
shadow-a blob of dark indistinguishable
shape disappearing into a doorway

tthis section of the hall was heavily
carpeted i padded noiselessly for-
ward into the deepening darkness it
wasnt a doorway into which the shadow
had plunged but the top of a steep flight
of descending back stairs solid black-
ness but down at the bottom there was
a vertical slit of light which marked a
door the slit was narrowing the door
evidently just being closed by whoever
it was i had been following the door
stopped ajar and abruptly i heard dim
voices they were muffled blurred by
the confined space and the sounds of the
storm but i caught fragments of the
words

  you-ludvig-what are you doing


terror tales

  no business of yours who was it
who came

  the forrests the old man and rolf
forrest his nephew and the old mans
daughter came-

  it w emit groff talking i felt sure
of that

  then ludvig said his daughter  i
saw her--pale but somehow glowing-
like burnished gold

  ludvig stop that you fool youll
get us into trouble with your devilish-
you talk like that to met emil you
dare talk like that

  yes i do its going to stop i tell
you these two damnable girlsr-when
they die-thats the end well have no
more in this house t

  get as into trouble there was a
wild cackhng laugh this ludvig whose
authority emil now was challenging-
was this a maniac or something near it

  get us into trouble worse than your
murders emil worse than--

  rtthees big money in that you fool
these forrests are rich- its all been care-
fully planned so there is no danger to us
in it tlus young fellow rolf forrest-
you-go to hell ludwig suddenly
rasped yon cant control me s youll do
what i tew you as you always have who
owns this building whose money set
you in business here again that wild
chuckling laughter you dare to tell me
what i shall do its pleasure emil
what is life without pleasure

  it seemed suddenly that they were scuf-
fling the door at the foot of these back
stairs clicked closed as one of them
bumped against it and the sounds were
shut from me with my heart pound-
ing i went back to edith a maniac
loose here thus ludvig lurking here
never showing himself intent only on his
lust for some weird fantastic pleasure

  edith was still at our bedroom door
jack what was it

  nothing i said some one may
have been up here-went down the back
stairs-i didnt see anybody-

  in a minute or two we left the room
muffled eerie laughter was coming again
from the bedroom in which the two girls
were locked in spite of ourselves we
stood a moment shudderingly listening
to it then we descended the front stair-
case in the front lower hall mrs groff
came forward to meet us

  ah my dear childfen-you are ready 
come in to supper

  she stood in her prim black taffeta
smiling at tis ingratiatingly hideous lit-
tle woman a travesty of yomanhood
like a grinning female gargoyle i won-
dered then if my revolted impressions of
her were not inspired by the mere mis-
fortune of her deformed physical ugli-
ness certainly she seemed trying to be
pleasant she led us along the back lower
hall to the dining room where a dozen
broad tables stood devoid of setting

  you have very few patients just now
i said

  yes-only two-millie serves them in
their room and a party of three who will
dine with you

  the table here in a comer of the din-
ing room was set for six the forrests
came now and when the introductions
were over mrs gioff said my hus-
band-he expected to be your host-but
he is detained-

  my thoughts leaped he was still hav-
ing trouble with ludvig why was there
no mention of this ludvig

  mrs groff added but dr groff will
join you presently as for me i must
help milhe- she smiled her grimace
upon us all she said this terrible
storm-we will do our best for you-
she moved off to the kitchen and mil-
lie served us five of us with one empty
chair like a spectre in our midst we
were in truth a strange little gathering
laugh and die



old mr forrest-a man with the aura
of wealth and the blight of illness so ob-
viously upon him rolf forrest his
nephew-stalwart darkly handsome fel-
low with an arrogant swagger that wealth
had doubtless given him

  and anne forrest to her most of
my interest went she was sitting beside
me-hair of pale gold-faultless com-
plexion-a face beautiful as a cameo
beautiful as edith amazing contrast
these two girls-the dark slim latin
beauty of edith inherited from our
mother and this anne like a little fra-
gile flower of the north

t need not detail our conversation
during the meal it was strained
awkward as though each of us might be
engrossed with thoughts that could not
be voiced edith and i told the mis-
adventures which had landed us there
and the others explained that old mr
forrest had come here for his health-a
nervous depression which had come upon
him from overwork in nashville

  i shall be lonely here he said som-
berly

  but only for a week or two uncle
rolf forrest said then youll be so
well well come and get you and take
you back

  anne forrest spoke hardly a word
but when the meal was nearly over at
a moment when the others were talking
with edith she suddenly leaned toward
me and i caught her agitated murmur
i must-see you alone tonight-please 
yes i murmured

  i had for the time forgotten that edith
and i were leaving tonight i admit i
was attracted with a singular swiftness
to the fragile golden beauty of anne for-
rest whatever menace was here in this
sinister household certainly it was di-
rected at this other girl not at edith and
her whisper now was appealing

  she added you and your sister-i-

im frightened-i must talk to you-
rolf forrest was saying yes we ex-
pected-anne and i-to go back to nash-
ville tonight but the accursed bridge is
down-no way of getting out of here-
for anybody-not till daylight

  it brought a gasp from edith and it
snapped me to alertness marooned here

  why i said nobody told us that
my sister and i were leaving tonight
young forrest shrugged

  not a chance you came over that
bridge-you know the one like a trestle
nearly falling down of its own weight-
he gestured just down the cliff a hun-
dred feet or so that lightning flash
lord wed only just gotten over the
bridge when the lightning hit it

  he laughed i suppose it was quite a
normal laugh but it sent a shudder over
me as though any form of laughter in this
mysterious house must carry horror

  that bridge he added just slid
sidewise and fell

  i looked to anne for confirmation and
she nodded mrs groff was approaching
helping millie with the dessert

  my husband has just been to verify
the wreck of the bridge she said it
is down on foot one might get around
the canyon to the other road by daylight
but it is many miles

  marooned here with the pale-gold
beauty of anne forrest beside me i own
that at that moment it did not seem so
horrible a catastrophe

  if i had known i would have taken
edith and anne and run out on foot to
huddle through the night among the black
storm-swept crags-if i had known

chapter three

murder stalks

wtell im not going to sleep
     edith said

well take turns keeping awake i


terror tales

agreed just as a matter of precaution
but dont lets get too tense over it

  i laughed shortly and i was startled
to see edith flash me a look a though
to her too the sound of laughter here was
frightening

  mysterious damn place i added
melancholia patients thats morbid
enough for anybody-but i dont see any
danger to us

  i said it lightly enough but the things
i knew that edith didnt know again
leaped at me the lurking ludvig a
third member of this groff family the
one who held the purse strings a lustful
fiend who must not be seen by us visitors
-or even mentioned demoniac with his
desires unspeakable so hideous that even
emil groff was revolted at them-afraid
of die consequences yet emil himself
had been-and perhaps was now-en-
gaged in murder and i thought of the
appeal of anne forrest something
was threatening her so that in her terror
she bad appealed to me a stranger

  i had had no opportunity yet of seeing
anne alone after supper we had all gone
into a cheerless little sitting room it was
by then nearly nine oclock we sat for
perhaps half an hour discussing the storm
which still was raging queer storms
these of the tennessee mountains the
lightning bolt which had demolished the
ramshackle bridge was the last no more
had come but the wind was still high
and the rain was still a torrent

  it seemed that anne was watching an
opportunity to talk to me alone but could
not find it then her father seemed tired
they went to their bedrooms with the
hunchback little mrs groff escorting
them to be sure they were comfortable
and edith and i followed

  at the top of the stairs as we all said
goodnight it seemed that anne flashed
me a gtence but whatever her meaning
i could not determine it

  you can sleep if you like edith was
saying and im staying here with you-
not in my room

  we sat together in one of the bedrooms
we had closed and locked the hall doors
of both rooms and left the connecting
door between them open the house had
gone almost immediately silent there
was up here on this floor with us as far
as we knew only the two girls locked in
the bedroom diagonally across the hall
and the forrests who had three adjacent
bedrooms on this upper hall just beyond
the front staircase

  those two girls whose unholy laughter
was so shocking to hear-i sat wondering
whether millie had taken up their supper
if any attention were being paid to them
they were silent now-a silence that
somehow seemed more ominous even than
their blood-chilling laughter

  the groffs and millie were downstairs
so far as i knew perhaps their bedrooms
were down there emil groff had not
appeared and that ludwig-

  i found that i was dozing with drifting
thoughts if only i were armed some
weapon-bn i had none save a very in-
effectual pea-knife but i mustnt mention
it to edith tomorrow i would see anne
again-

  that ludvig-would he be roaming the
house now

  the thought snapped me into alertness
  what is it jack

  nothing edith hadnt you better lie
down on the bed ill stay awake

  no im all right here

  abruptly the small electric bulb in the
room was extinguished we were plunged
into darkness

  jackr

  sit still i murmured probably itll
come on in a minute

  but it did not all through the storm
the lights of the house had been wavering
but now it seemed permanent
laugh and die



fphe darkness crowded us-frightened
against all reason i could hear ediths
terrified breathing her hand reached out
and gripped my arm

  oh-jack

  easy i said there was a stump
of candle on the table i guess the lights
up here in these mountains are never very
dependable

  i fumbled and found the candle flighted
it even its wavering tiny yellow glow
was reassuring then a startling thought
hit me the light was out in our adjoining
room the storm during the last half
hour had seemed rapidly abating the
rain had ceased  the wind was still strong
but noticably less than before and outside
our windows now there was fitful moon-
light queer that having weathered the
storm the lights would go out now were
they out all over the house or just in our
two rooms had someone pulled out a
fuse to plunge us and all the house per-
haps into darkness

  i went to the bedroom door with
ediths gaze upon me

  what is it jack

  just want to see if the lights are out
in the hall

  the little hall was solidly dark evi-
dently every light in the house was ex-
tinguished and there was a new silence
here now-a black empty silence with
the rattle of rain on the roof missing-
and the surge of the wind almost gone so
that now the silence was blank unnatural
i stood straining my hearing was that
a dim choking sound of laughter

  i turned to edith

  those girls i said softly laughing
again

  was it laughter or something else
now  on impulse i crossed diagonally to
the door on the other side of the hall
behind me edith stood framed in our
doorway by the candlelight

  i reached the other doorway laughter 

it was soft eerie a choked laughter i
bent with my ear to the wooden panel
and i heard a blur of confused sounds
the thump of the girls moving about
and queerly gruesome sounds of their
suppressed voices giggles  a laugh
choking into a sob   a thump with a
revolting giggling little scream   

  with wild running thoughs i straight-
ened to return to edith and frozen i
stood tense with dilating nostrils what
was this i was smelling a drift from
under the girls door a faint weird
smell of which i had suddenly become
aware a stench a perfume inde-
finable-

  i went back to edith closed our bed-
room door and locked it

  theyre in there i said just the
same-laughing-poor little devils-
maniacs-

  there must have been some look on my
face that stopped her questioning i did
not meet her gaze

  lie down edith i added the night
will seem interminable if you just sit
there

  im all right

  half an hour it did indeed seem an
eternity as i sat alone with my question-
ing thoughts beside me in a little wood-
en rocker with a bed pillow behind her
edith was dozing

  and suddenly in the silence i heard a
tap on our bedroom door soft furtive
edith sat up staring at me wordlessly
the tap came again

  dont open it edith warned as i
rose

  at the door i said softly

  who is it  what you want 

 mr baker oh please- annes
voice i jerked open the door and she
came in like a white darting wraith the
light of the candle she was carrying paint-
ing her head and neck with its yellow
glow


terror tales

  you- edith gasped and as i
snatched the candle anne ran to edith
with a little -cry

  oh-ive been so frightened-i had
to come to you when the lights went
out a while ago-i just couldnt stand it-
i had to come-

  she was shaking with cold and terror
edith led her to the bed and sat there
with arms around her

  what is it dear youre frightened
weh of course-this ghastly house

tust a girl terrified at being alone in
this weird place so that she was im-
pelled to seek protection from us strangers
even though her father and cousin were
here with her ediths glance questioned
me i said gently

  i couldnt make any opportunity to
talk with yotl i thought tomorrow-
tomorrow may--may be too late she
gasped oh i suppose its just my silly
fears this-this ghastly house as you
say but i was afraid even before rolf
brought father and me up here

  my mind flung back to that altercation
i had heard at the foot of the stairs just
before supper emil groff and the mys-
terious ludwig these forrests are
rich its -all been carefully planned
your cousin rolf brought you up
here i demanded

  yes father was taken ill-a sort of
nervous breakdown depressed-threat-
ened with what they call melancholia
then rolf found this place he came up
here to inspect it they-they cure people
here who have melancholia- she sucked
in her breath depressed insanity-thats
what they call it when it gets worse and
rolf said that the cure here was wonderful
and he persuaded father to come

  like a little fight in distant darkness
i began to understand

  your father is rich  i said gently
  she stared yes and she added with

a stark note of terror in her voice
youre guessing what im thinking its
only my imagination maybe but i-ive
always been afraid of rolf he wants to
marry me-i dont love him-

  afraid for yourself i murmured
no afraid for father my father said
hed never let rolf marry me and theres
the business-the inheritance rolf is
general manager now but father doesnt
like his work they-they quarreled a
few weeks ago and father threatened to
have rolf leave die business-and to
change ids will maybe

  murder for a price so that was what
emil groff was after i big money in it-
no danger to us-all carefully planned-
this place a murder house-where one
might bring his intended victim to be
killed i a little of this grewsome sinister
mystery-one angle of it at least-now
seemed plain

  i said swiftly

  is your father sleeping alone now
yes he has one bedroom-rolfs is
adjoining with a door between them mine
is next to rolfs

  no door between you and rolf
no and i got terrified-just think-
ing oh what are you going to do

  i had seized one of the candles

  wake your father up i said well
have to plan some way to guard him

  in truth i had no plan save that i
could not let that old man sleep in there
alone now if only i had a weapon i
saw now so many adversaries tonight in
this sinister household  emil groff in-
tent upon murdering this victim-aided
no doubt by his malevolent gargoyle wife
and rolf forrest here to see the murder
accomplished and to take the body back
home with dr groffs death certificate

  and the lurking fiendish ludvig-
what part would he play in this 

  both the girls were clinging to me i
said
laugh and die



  well figure out some excuse to guard
your father well tell him you got too
frightened to stay alone then edith and
i will stay with you and him-

  they fallowed me clinging to me as i
opened our door and raised the candle
to light the dark and silent hallway it
was only fifty feet to the bedroom of
annes father we passed the front hall
stairs no sound the wavering little
light from my candle shone partly down
the stairs with solid blackness in the lower
hall

  this is your fathers door anne

  yes-

  i rapped softly i said softly

  mr forrest-oh mr forrest wake
up

  the silence was ominous ghastly ter-
rifying the old door rattled slightly as
though from a puff of wind behind it i
turned its knob and shoved but it did
not yield it was locked on the inside

  anne you call him edith murmured

  father father dear-

  no answer though i rapped again
much louder it was loud enough now
to arouse rolf i turned to the adjacent
door

  this rolfs

  yes

  i thumped

  rolf forrest let me in this is
jack baker let me in

  no answer i turned the knob the
unlocked door went inward with my shove
and i burst into the room with the girls
behind me it was unlighted save by an
eerie shaft of moonlight from the window
and now the light of my candle the bed
had not been occupied rolf forrest was
not here to one side was the closed com-
municating door to the bedroom of annes
father i dashed to it turned its knob
it swung and i went through

    gust of wind met me extinguishing
my candle the window was wide
open with moonlight streaming in and a
blast of the night air annes father lay
in the bed with the covers to his chin he
seemed to be peacefully sleeping i bent
over him pallid face in the moonlight
behind me the girls were shuddering

  i said mr forrest wake up i
shook him insistently with a wave of dis-
may sweeping me because i knew it was
futile then i swung you girls step
back he-hes fainted i guess

  anne gave a little cry and edith drew
her back both of them knew what i
meant

  dead he lay here unbreathing i
jerked down the window sash-i saw out-
side that sheer drop of a hundred feet or
more down to the little canyon of the
mountain torrent then i turned back to
the bed dead unquestionably yet so
far as i could tell no mark of violence on
him no blood no wound no sign even
that the bedclothes had been rumpled no
contortion of the face nor the muscles of
the limbs as one who dies by poison

  what had done this what mysterious
agency of murder was this to leave a
peaceful unmarked corpse which rolf
forrest could take back to nashville and
offer for autopsy perhaps secure that no
evidence of murder would exist as
though to answer my unspoken question
it seemed now that despite the opened
window and the blast of night air there
was a vague smell in the room a stench 
a perfume indefinable-

  dead i said gently the two hor-
rified girls were staring at me from the
communicating doorway i shoved them
back into rolfs room and closed the door
on the moonlit scene of death we were
too late anne

  and what were we to do now so
many lurking adversaries here-

the hall door of rolfs little bedroom


terror tales

still was open and abruptly all three of
us stood here in the dim moonlight frozen
with a new surge of horror from out-
side in the hall there came the sound of
dragging a slow labored scraping on the
hall floor-a sound so grewsomely hor-
rible that i stood transfixed holding the
two shuddering girls and with my breath
seeming to stick in my throat my kps
dry   

  the sound stopped came again a
little louder as though nearer tiny
muffled thumps mingled with a dragging
scrape something out there in the hall
dragging itself toward os

  i was hardly aware that i had moved
to the door stood with the girls huddling
against me so that we crowded the door-
way with the moonlit room behind us
the distant hall was blank darkness from
out of which the sound was coming the
moonlight straggled past us and laid its
wan pallid glow on the hall floor in a
little patch just before our door the
blackness was a wall berond it gbasfiy
approaching dragging thumps there in
the blackness   

  with a rush of terror so shocking to
my senses that the grisly scene swam and
blurred before me i saw down by the
fleer a head appear a head of straggling
long brown hair wild and tangled a
disembodied head a face livid whites
contorted with mortal agony-smeared
with blood-wm staring eyes-a mouth
with parted lips like a crimson smear-

  millie for all the noisome horror i
was conscious of my recognition the
groff maid-her disembodied head hob-
bling here no there was a ghastly throat
now-and white shoulders with the brown
hair tangled on them another dragging
labored hitch-i saw now her pitiful body
lying on the floor emerging into the
moonlight patch as sldwjy she dragged
herself hitching on one elbow

  i tried tb shove edith and anne behind

  me but like me they were staring with
shocked whirling senses millie dragging
herself here in death agony-her throat
a crimson gash with the blood stream-
ing-draining-

  she saw me now her hand tried to
gesture her gasping dying breath choked
with blood was audible-and i was aware
that i had flung off the girls and was
bending over her

  millie-

  hes-dead i just found him mur-
dered--his throat cut-like mine oh and
i-loved him-so much-

  millie whos dead  who murdered
him

  her head had fallen now the blood
rattled in her throat then other words
came

  he-murdered him-and did for me-
just now hell murder everybody he
is-

  the words rattled off into the last
choking agony of her death her whole
body twitched for a moment then jay
still her white cheek against the floor
with a spreading crimson stain under it

chapter four

room of the maniac girls

tvturder stalking in the blackness of
this ghastly household old mr
forrest dead here in his bed millie here
in the hall with slashed throat and
some one else was murdered millie had
said some one whose body millie had
found lying somewhere here in the dark-
some man millie loved who was it
the fiendish ludvig dr emil groff
or-rolf forrest and who had mur-
dered him

  hell-murder everybody he is-

  the choking words of the dying girl
echoed in my head as i leaped to my feet
lurking stalking fiend roaming this
house with the frenzy of these murders
laugh and dib



turning him into a raging madman so that
now he would not stop until he had mur-
dered us alt

  and i was unarmed i seized the pallid
trembling anne and edith shoved them
through the doorway of the room anne
had seen occupying it had no communi-
cating door into aflj other room it was
smao compact its single window over-
looked a sheer drop into the canyon-
no chance of an assailant coming through
the window barricaded in here we would
be safe--

  the bed was a small narrow iron affair
  a weapon for me

  edith gasped

  what are you doing 

 a weapon help me	

  i tumbled the bedding to the floor
snatched off the mattress lifted out the
springs a jerk and i had detached from
its slot one of the iron side rails of the
frame it was nearlyseven feet long with
it i could crack the head of any orre or
anything that came near me

  a frenzied panic for action was upon
me i turned to the girls

  you lock yourselves in here theres
a telephone near the foot of the stairs
im going to call for help-the police in
the nearest town i wont be a minute 
well barricade ourselves in here-

  or should we run from the house out
to the wind-swept crags more danger-
ous inside or outside  who could say-
yet to me then it seemed that we would
be safer locked in this room than in the
open moonlit wildness outside

  you lock the door i reiterated
dont open it unless you hear my voice
they nodded wordlessly i stood with
the iron bedrail in my hand listening as
they locked the door this silent house
the grisly corpse of millie lay at my feet
brooding black silence everywhere
amazing silence edith and anne had
screamed at the horrible sight of the dying

millie and certainly i had made enough
clatter snatching apart the bed yet the
house stood unaroused darkly silent
where were all its other occupants two
maniac girls still locked doubtless in
their bedroom up here at the other end of
the hall but rolf forrest mrs groff
emil groff-and ludvig one of them
millie had said was murdered but the
others where were they now that my
commotion had not aroused them had
they vanished like spectres or like mil-
lie were they all lying here somewhere-
murdered all but one and that one
somewhere here was lurking   

  from the stairs i could see faint shafts
of moonlight now dimly illumining the
lower hall no one-nothing down there
i stood on the stairs with die heavy bed-
rail poised straining my hearing as
though by force of will i could penetrate
the silence and hear this monstrous ad-
versary at the bottom of the steps i
stood peering wan eerie patches of
moonlight by the windows-and so many
shadows everywhere each of which might
hold the lurking monster

  there was a little moonlight glow by
the wall telephone with every muscle
alert i went there rested the heavy iron
bar beside me and lifted the receiver un-
canny silence of the instrument like the
uncanny silence of the house no buzz
of current no distant operators inquiring
voice

  and then i saw the cut wires dangling
under the box the fiend had been here

i could send no call for hdp with a
deepened sense of terror i seized the bed-
rail and fled back up the stairs at the
door of annes room i rapped i called
sharply

  its jack-let me in-

  and as the words were still echoing i
felt my heart contract as though as icy
hand were clutchihg it silence a silence


terror tales

so fraught with horrible import that it
whirled and blurred my senses

  edith anne let me in edith
answer me edith-

  silence so horrible i pounded the door
rattled its knob then i stepped back-
ward half stumbling over the gruesome
body of millie-and i lunged with the
heavy bedrail the wooden casement that
held the lock smashed inward the door
swung and i went with it

fthe little moonlit bedroom was empty

   the window locked on the inside
was undisturbed but edith and anne
were gone

  a stark panic descended upon me in
that terrible moment so that i lunged and
flung aside the heap of bedding shoved
wildly at the bureau as though by some
diabolic necromancy the two girls might
still be here though at a glance i had
seen they were not   

  and then i saw where they had gone
a panel of the wall showed a narrow
slit-a sliding door here which when
closed was undiscemable but it was not
quite closed now a doorway to some
descending secret lair i shoved my fin-
gers into the vertical opening the panel
slid sidewise and i launched myself
through brandishing the bedrail

  i was merely in the adjoining bed-
room-a duplicate of annes with a white
iron bed unmade moonlight through the
closed window no one here i stooped
hurriedly searching no one nothing
the rooms single door was ajar it ad-
mitted me back into the hall only a few
feet from millies body

  so great a terror was on me now that
i was hardly conscious of rational reas-
oning where had the fiend taken them
somewhere in this ghastly house-lud-
vig lusting for pleasure lusting for the
white beauty of young womanhood the
room up here in which the two maniac

girls were confined had the fiend taken
edith and anne there had the maniac
girls come out and lured them

  i dashed to that other door it still
was locked i listened with ear to its
panel no sound there was only my
own panting breath and thumping heart
with the bedrail i burst in the door

  ghastly scene disheveled room of these
maniac girls filmy garments strewn and
scattered a place of lusting pleasure
mute now with death    death every-
where in this house a gust of wind from
the open window met me and there was
enough moonlight glow so that i stood
gaping at the silent tragic scene the
two maniac girls were here white bodies
scantily clothed hair down one was
sprawled on the floor with arms up on
the sill of the open window the other
was beside her one arm over her com-
panions hip

  both of them dead unmarked by
violence for a moment i stood transfixed
peering down at them so pallid in the
moonlight and i saw now their slim
bodies revealed by death to be wasted to
thinness pitiful little creatures maniacs
only with this strange lusting spell which
had been upon them pinched thin cheeks
under the rouge-bodies in life consumed
by the fire of their lusts so that now in
death they seemed only pallid wraiths
of womanhood and on both the con-
torted faces there was a frozen grimace
as though even in death they were trying
wildly to laugh

  in that shocked moment i saw also a
curious aspect to these death postures a
sort of stretching of the necks-gaping
stretching mouths-as though the one at
the window realizing that death was upon
her had staggered here flung up the sash 
and then fallen and on the floor had again
reached upward stretching with her
mouth for the air too late to save her
laugh and die



and the other weaker had seemed to
have been dragging herself-

  my mind flung back that stench
that perfume indefinable-

  it was here now widening my nostrils
the room was permeated with it clinging
saturating this carpet these draperies for
all the wind from the opened window i
smelled it now more strongly than ever
before and with every breath i was
conscious of a itttle heady thrill to my
senses gruesome lethal breaths that
seemed to hold a lure as i sucked them
in-a wild pleasure of the senses that
could only end in death

  i gathered my wits edith and anne
were not here i searched the room-
peered along the walls for some loose
panel and then brandishing the iron
bedrail futilely for there seemed nothing
but the dead remaining in this terrible
house i fled back to the hall the right-
angle turn to the left was here i dashed
around it was that a moving shape off
there m the distance along the halt i
went with a wild run no-it was nothing
but my memory of that shadow i had
pursued here just before supper

  i found myself at the head of the back
stairs the door at the bottom was partly
open now with a little moonlight glowing
behind it cautiously i descended
stopped to listen only silence here

  at the bottom i shoved the door but
it bumped something on the other side-
something which partly yielded to my
shove the door moved wider with a
dim scraping on the floor behind it like
millie dragging herself-

  like millie i pushed myself through
the door-opening i was in a small back
lower hall with a nearby window ad-
mitting moonlight something was here
on the floor at my feet-i had shoved and
moved it when i pushed the door

  like millie the huddled body of emil
groff was lying here weltering from a

ghastly crimson slash that almost severed
the throat

  this charnel house of death i rose
erect i think vaguely i may have heard
a sound behind me but it was engulfed
by a crash on my skull the world seemed
to split with a roar and a burst of bril-
liant light so that i was conscious only
that the bedrail was clattering from my
hand as i fell

chapter five

orgy of death

ith all my senses faded there was
for me nothing but a blank abyss of
empty soundless darkness death itself
may be like that but presently after
some nameless interval i was aware that
i was alive dimly conscious i could
feel myself lying on the floor with rope
lashing my wrists behind me and wrapped
around my ankles

  my senses faded again but i struggled
this time to hold a little something which
was me in the blackness there was the
sound of a panting breath the fiend was
here i could feel fingers tying the rope
at my ankles the fabric of garments
brushed me and i could hear the breath-
ing that was the swift triumph of a frenzy
about to be consummated

  then i was being carried half car-
ried half dragged with head and
shoulders raised and my legs trailing on
the floor as this gibbering adversary
tugged and panted with my six-foot bulk

  and sight dimly was coming to me
vague moonlight this was the narrow
back hallway along which i was being
dragged a door opened i was jerked
through tumbled to what seemed the soft-
ness of a rug strange smell here a
perfume  distinctly a perfume now
exotic aromatic smell like some powerful
incense burning here

i heard the door slam closed and at


terror tales

my appearance there had seemed the dim
blurred sound of a girls terrified cry
edith  anne  memory of them snatched
my senses to greater alertness i was
conscious of a throbbing pain at the back
of my head my hair wet and matted
doubtless with blood but the horrible
weakness was leaving me strength
coming back to my limp muscles all my
confused senses sharpening clarifying

  i was in a dimly candlelit apartment
draped and shrouded heavily carpeted
soft chairs couches wall rugs and hang-
ings great splashes of red and black
velvet macabre interior paintings on
the walls with the flickering candelight
vaguely disclosing their voluptuous
nudities   

  a guttural voice at my ear said

  oh you are not dead that i hoped
a grim gibbering chuckle-unholy
laugh that had nothing of mirth in it but
only horror then you sit here and
watch you will enjoy this before you
die-

  i saw above me the leering malevol-
ently vile face of mrs groff gargoyle
woman fiend with her bent thick body
like a gorilla of amazing strength the
prim black taffeta dress was blood-soaked
now she stood shaking trembling with
the frenzy of murderous demoniac
triumph

  you sit here and watch beside
him-

t felt myself being propped up like a
bent bundle on the floor with cushions
behind me another figure was here
ghastly shape sagging here beside me i
turned my head to regard it rolf for-
rest he sagged here propped by cush-
ions so that he could not fall but slumped
with dangling head against his chest
grisly companion his face was livid
blood-streaked blood welled from a
wound in his side-a great slash which

had ripped his shirt half from him ex-
posing his crimsoned flesh dead no
he was still breathing faint gasping
breaths of unconsciousness

  swift disclosures no more than half
a minute had passed since i was flung
into this room i heard again that girls
cry-and with senses at last fully clari-
fied i saw across the long apartment in
shadows beyond the candlelight a broad
couch of black and red drapes edith and
anne were huddling there unharmed
save by the extremity of their terror they
crouched clinging to each other di-
sheveled with hair tumbling to their
shoulders and their clothing half tom
from them

  the thick gargoyle shape of mrs groff
swung away from me and then came
back maniacal glittering eyes gibbering
unholy laughter hideous face so frenzied
now that it was contorted beyond sem-
blance of either woman or man so that
it was only a monster

  you two will watch-that will be
pleasure indeed for us all him i did
not mean to kill-not just yet but he
made me with his fighting-

  she leered down at me and young for-
rest  then like a gorilla she swayed away
at the wall where now she stopped for
a moment i saw a row of huge upright
steel cylinders each tall as a man with
a pressure-gage on top she opened their
valves now in the sudden silence i could
hear the gas hissing out to mingle with
the perfume of the incense which drifted
in a lazy cloud from a brazier on the
table

  then she was at the couch where edith
and anne lay pawing at tjiem with quiv-
ering hands

  oh you are afraid of me little
beautiful ones-you so slim and dark-
and you pale like white gold-

  i tugged frantically futilely at my
bonds beside me the dying rolf twitched
laugh and die



and anne shrank back before her cfw-
a little as though he too were spurred to
frenzied effort edith now was scream-
ing as the vile hag pawed her

  you are afraid of met you want me
not to touch you but this is pleasure
little ones the smell of pleasure will be
with us in a moment you hear it hiss
cant yon begin to smell it now you
feel its caress you must laugh now and
be happy it is the smell of laughter-the
intoxication of laughter-the thrill of
doing everything your senses bid you to
do-and laughing-laughing-

  raging maniac now and as i panted
jerking at the ropes that lashed me i
could feel my nostrils dilating    that
little heady thrill to my senses with every
breath  i choked back a grim laugh
god why coaid i laugh when horror
tingled every fiber of me

  then the crooked gorilla-hags voice
rose louder

  listen  he laughed  we must all
laugh abruptly the caressing tone
turned to rage and still you resist me
you will not lose your senses to the
pleasures that are coming  because i am
a woman

  suddenly the claw-like hands swept up
to her head the primly parted hair was
snatched away to become a wig wildly
fkmg across the room this demoniac
fiend-not a woman i saw his bullet
head of close-clipped black hair and now
with clawing hands he tore away the
taffeta waist and white ruching so that
from under it his muscular hairy chest
seemed to burst out freed of its pinching
garment

  see my beautiful dear ones- he
stood swaying before -the couch gorilla
now indeed in every physical aspect
see the woman you thought me is
gone-mrs groff-gone-never existing
i am ludvig-master of pleasure-master
of laughter-

out the girls were screaming again as
he readied to clutch them ludvig
my half drugged senses whirled with
complete realization this charnal house
of death-we the living-the only sur-
vivors now-were all gathered here in
this room of lust ludvig emil groffs
older brother who masqueraded always
as the wife of dr erail groff to give a
greater semblance of respectability to this
supposed sanitarium-to give him also
a greater freedom with the young girl
patients who had been admitted here-
until with the spell of lasting laughter
upon them he could disclose himself as
a man

  these diabolic steel cylinders com-
pressed oxygen diluted in the air as
normally we breathe it oxygen is life-
giving i think in the case of annes
father nsthing but pure oxygen was used
we later found the tubes under his bed
leading it from tanks at a distant part of
the house he had gone to sleep perhaps
with a sedative his window had been
ordered closed against the storm-and
then the oxygen had been introduced

  strange device for murder an over-
stimulcion of the heart which in die old
mans case emil groff had known would
certainly kill him quickly and from the
blood and tissues of such a murdered vic-
tim the over-charge of pure oxygen
quickly wih evaporate so that no autopsy
can discover the cause of death

  unique murder plot emil groff doubt-
less had been successful with it many
times but the half-mad ludvig was not
interested what diabolic other gases he
mixed with the oxygen to create in his
girl victims the lust that enslaved them
has never been disclosed

  i had almost overheard the murder of
emil for unquestionably that quarrel at
the foot of the back stairs had led ludvig
to an impulsive slashing of his younger


terror tales

brothers throat for ludvig then the
die was cast whatever vestige of rea-
son he had ever possessed must have been
swept into maniacal frenzy then with his
brother lying weltering before him so
that ludvig saw only that he must kill
every one here with me perhaps his
most feared antagonist still alive-and
edith and anne still with me-his twist-
ed brain must have told him to hide the
evidence of the gas so that he crept
through the wall panel with which most
of these rooms were equipped opened old
mr forrests window and verified that
the old man was dead

  and with each ghastly murder lud-
vigs frenzy was telling him that he was
nearing undisturbed possession of anne
and edith the culmination of his unholy
lusts now was at hand the dim candle-
lit room here had once been a storeroom
back of the kitchen-equipped by ludvig
for the lair of his orgies and he was
laughing now with his triumph so near

  yon feel it now little white beauties
you breathe its thrill intoxicating pleas-
ure-

  and i could feel it now more over-
whelming with every breath a thrilling
exultant pound of my heart a wild sense
of power desires stirring in me-an in-
toxication of the senses-a falling away
of shackles of restraint which always be-
fore had been upon me and my animal
desires-

 god was i laughing was that
ediths wild laugh of intoxication ringing
out mingled with her half-choked screams
of horror i saw the hideous monstrous
form of the half clothed ludvig reaching
across the couch-the white intoxicated
shuddering girls-

tvtth all the pounding wildness of
my new-found strength still the

damnable rope was holding me my
lunges bumped the blood-soaked body of
rolf forrest he slumped against me
his contorted face twitched-not quite
dead for the oxygen was bringing a last
little strength to hold death away a mo-
ment longer

  and what was this rolfs almost va-
cant eyes imploring me a little twitch
at my lashed wrists behind me his dy-
ing twitching fingers with a little stimu-
lated strength in them plucking at my
bonds his numbing brain with death
creeping into it still could direct his
twitching fingers-

  then the death rattle was in his throat
a shudder swept him-a twitching and
then he slumped and fell forward on his
face and lay motionless

  i jerked and found that my arms were
free i fumbled at my ankles cast off the
last of the rope and sprang erect ludvig
did not see me as i bounded the twenty
feet across the heavy red carpet he was
sprawled forward on the couch laugh-
ing pawing

  with a last bound like a pouncing ani-
mal i was on him-lifting his hideous
vile little body with all the amazing power
of my intoxicated strength so that i
shook him as though he were a gigantic
rat and whirled and pounded his gargoyle
head aginst the nearest of the steel cyl-
inders pounded-and laughed with my
own wild unholy laughter until his head
cracked-and i cast him dead upon the
floor

 edith anne-come-

  with my arms around them we ran
slamming the door upon the ghastly
room and up in the house i wrapped
their shuddering bodies in blankets and
we sat through the night waiting for the
dawn

embrace of tke python

bg robert c blackmon

author of graveyard guardian etc 

it was a strange sickness that as-
        sailed john bellam for his skin
        had become covered with
        reptilian scales - and
        every dawn revealed some
        body crushed as though
        by a huge serpent

revulsion grew in stan-
ley austins lithe body as

	he stated down at the fig-
ure of john bellam in the mountain cot-
tage bedspom

bellams thin body tapering slowly
from bony legs to narrow shoulders made
a strangely reptilian shape beneath the

bed covers flakes of dead cuticle cov-
ered every visible inch of his skin rim-
ming his pale lips and surrounding his




terror tales

close-spaced eyes which were bright and
ophidian in their fixity his wrists and
hands covered with the dry scales and
thrusting from his pajama sleeves were
like broad-headed serpents nesting in the
bed linen

  mary bellam had told stanley that-her
uncle john bellam owner of bellams
greater circus was recovering from a
skin disorder but the warning had not
prepared the young lawyer for anything
like this he must have shuddered for
marys warm hands tightened reassur-
ingly upon his arm

  mary has chosen well the words
hissed from bellams lips his cold eyes
moved slowly from stanleys polished
shoes to the strong breadth of his shoul-
ders the firm set of his well-shaped head
bellam moved one hand the long scaled
fingers coiling palmward and the brown
hair prickled along the back of stanleys
neck i wish you both great happiness

  thank you mr bellam impulsively
stanleys right hand thrust forward and
he took another step toward the bed then
horror chilled him as mary clutched fran-
tically at his arm

  stan no her voice was a terri-
fied wail

  dont touch me john bellam re-
coiled with the swiftness of a serpent
you might- abruptly his thin body
relaxed sorry to frighten you but
were not sure about-this his right
hand slid across his chest moving with
the slow grace of a reptile bellams
greater circus specializes in giant py-
thons and boas i have always loved
snakes since this happened a month ago
ive wondered if handling the big snakes
could have-

  he stopped as the door behind stanley
and mary opened

  stanley turned and gulped as a squat
misshapen man waddled into the room
the mans big eyes bulging almost level

with jutting brows slid over him then
flicked to the bed he was strangely
nervous and frightened

  you call misser bella his voice
was a throaty croak

  no bellams tongue darted out to
moisten pale lips mr austin this is
shagar he was my snake-man until a
maddened python attacked him bellams
glittering eyes seemed to mock the squat
figure beside the bed shagar hates
snakes oddly he believes i am becom-
ing a giant python bellams rustling
chuckle made stanleys scalp tighten i
believe shagar hates me for-

  i-i- shagars gnarled fingers
clasped nervously his bulging eyes
darted fearfully about the room and stan-
ley saw terror in their colorless depths
i hate snake i no hate you misser-
enough bellams hand lifted a
scaled reptile rearing its broad flat head
mary you elbert weiss and shagar are
circus folks you have cared for me in
spite of this therefore i shall make ar-
rangements to leave each of you a third
interest in bellams greater circus i shall
be dead within the week

  uncle john stanley felt marys slim
body quiver against him

  you shouldnt permit yourself mr
bellam to- he began uncomfortably

  i shant bellams bright eyes slitted
and stanley felt a chill feeling that was
half fear creep through his veins i
regret dying a human and tamely in
bed bellams glittering eyes seemed to
stare through and beyond the three be-
side the bed id prefer the swift death
of the jungle-the stunning impact of a
lightning thrust from overhanging branch-
es-the anasthesia of fear then coil
after coil of steel-cabled body-

  please near-hysteria sharpened
marys voice

  your pardon mary suddenly bel-
embrace of the python



lams voice was mild and lulling where
is elbert shagar

  he-he go see dog the snake-mans
twisted body seemed to shrink

  dog

  something ketch dog back of cottage
shagar said squirming nervously his
bulging eyes wide with terror it-it
squeeze dog-dead his voice dropped
to a terrified whisper it kill like big
python v

  python breath whistled shrilly from
bellams slitted nostrils soul-wracking
fear froze his thin sailed features and
his voice was the voice of a damned be-
ing merciful god have i already-
hello everybody

  the nasal voice came from behind stan-
ley he swung about and saw a well-built
man of about thirty standing in the open
doorway the newcomer was tall and
muscular and his sleek hair glistened in
the afternoon light coming from the open
front door at the end of the hall

  oh pardon me his black eyes ap-
praised stanley didnt know we had
company

  mr weiss this is stan-stanley aus-
tin mary said and clung tightly to stan-
leys arm

  congrats and all that stan youre
lucky the pressure of weiss hand upon
stanleys was quick and strong next
thursday so mary says shes a prize
but im warning you-youre marrying
into a circus crowd of course im not
really one of the family but-

  certainly you are elbert said bel-
lam as his pale lips bared long fanglike
teeth in a fond smrle youve been with
me for years and youll share equally
with mary and shagar in the circus after
im gone we-

  thanks mr bellam but lets not
talk about your-going weiss stepped
to the bed clasping long-fingered hands
behind his back his black eyes darted

to shagars twisted figure shagar told
you about the dog eh 

  elbert is it true was the animal
really- bellam had risen to a sitting
position and his close-spaced eyes were
filled with stark terror

  it was weiss eyes lifted from bel-
lams scaled body and stanley saw his
lips tighten the dog was crushed-ap-
parently by a huge snake but that of
course is impossible a boa anaconda or
a python couldnt live in this mountain
climate it- he snapped long fingers
i almost forgot were going to have
more company i saw herman kelleys
big red car coming up the road hes
probably after bellams circus again con-
solidating kelleys and bellams would
make the biggest combination in-

  if that scoundrel- bellams slitted
eyes were flaming with hate

  hi anybody home the big voice
boomed through the cottage the screen
door banged and heavy feet stamped
toward the bedroom hi elbert you
get purtier and purtier mary hi john
stanley didnt have to be told that the
heavy-jowled giant barging into the bed-
room was herman kelley owner of kel-
leys shows

  heard you was sick john so i come
to see you kelleys big feet slapped the
floor toward the bed his little piggish
eyes swept stanley from head to foot
mary introduced them glad to know
any guy mary knows kelley grinned
and turned to the bed now john-
herman kelley the words spat
from bellams lips he drew away from
the rival show owner like a snake settling
to strike if youve come up here to-
easy john said kelley spreading a
beefy hand my shows playing maxton
four miles over the hills i heard you was
sick so i come over to- abruptly kel-
leys heavy jaw dropped and he backed


terror tales

away from the bed holy cats john
yon got scales like a snake

  uncle john has malignant eczema
mary spoke indignantly as she left stan-
ley and moved toward the bed her curly
blond head high he is in no condition
to discuss-

  okay okay it-it just gimme a
turn seeing them scales kelley mopped
at his beefy face with a purple-edged
handkerchief i-i been catching hell
with snakes lately bought some boas and
pythons from a busted show and the
damn worms been driving me nuts the
biggest python got away in maxton
got away mary screamed in a way
that made stanleys teeth dick together
then the dog was-

  you-youre hunting for the snake
the words pushed from stanleys tight
throat the crushed dog-perhaps a
crushed human next-his eyes sought
marys trim blond figure and a shudder
rippled through his body

  hunting it hell kelley sworted i
should delay the show and waste a thou-
sand bucks for a fifty-dollar worm the
damn thing cant live in these mountains
it belongs to the guy who finds it
then a grin split kelleys red face yet
his keen little eyes watched bellams every
move how bout five grand over my
last offer for bellams circus youre
laid up and there aint no telling how-
get out i bellams sharp hiss drove
the larger man back kelley barged to
the door then stopped turned and leveled
a thick finger

  you might jests well sell me the show
john he boomed piglike eyes narrowed
ill get it-sooner or later

  then kelley was gone his heavy feet
pounding out of the cottage

wmheres the dog

elbert weiss slightly ahead of
stanley austin and shagar pointed

through the thin growth of pines and un-
derbrush in the narrow valley behind the
mountain cottage two strides of stan-
leys long legs brought him beside elbert
shagar waddled at the lawyers heels

  directly before the three men a shape-
less bundle of brownish-gray fur huddled
upon the needle-carpeted ground bright
afternoon sun sifted through the trees and
splashed the ghastly object with shafts of
light

  elbert moved toward the thing stan-
ley followed

  he could hear shagar waddling behind
him the twisted snake-man was mutter-
ing viciously beneath his breath they
reached the crushed carcass and a strange
mingling of nausea and fear gripped stan-
ley austin

  the animal had been a well-developed
german police dog now it was but a
horribly shapeless mass f blood-clotted
fur a throaty croak made stanleys scalp
tighten before he realized the sound was
commg from shagar the crippled snake-
man was staring down at the crushed dog
his bulging eyes glazed with horror

  python do that a shudder twitched
shagars squat misshapen body  most
do me like that misser bella watch
laugh like he glad i hurt he been
punch snake make him mad he hate
me shagars croaking voice went shrill
he like to kill me misser bella talk
to snake tell him to squeeze me snake
talk to him hiss misser bella always
half-snake he be all snake quick he
ketch me-do me like-that he squeeze
me-squeeze more people like-

  nonsense shagar elbert weiss
laugh was strained he wetted his lips
nervously forget the crazy stuff he
seemed forcibly to tear his black eyes
from the dogs crushed body weve got
to get that python you take the other
side of the vahey you know what to do
stanley youd better go to the little clear-
embrace of the python



ing about a quarter-mile down the valley
if the python comes near you sing out
shagar and ill be with you in two min-
utes im going up the valley and work
back we ought to have a few more men
but- well lets go

  elbert stalked off through the trees
heading toward the left

  still muttering shagar waddled past
the dogs carcass and headed across the
valley stanley could hear him slipping
on the pine needles after his twisted fig-
ure had disappeared behind the trees the
young lawyer started down the valley his
muscular fingers tight about the short club
he lhad picked up near the cottage

  elbert had said the python would be
unlikely to measure over eighteen feet
and it would undoubtedly be sluggish
half-dormant yet-

  a tight smile touched stanleys firm
lips as he moved forward cautiously
brown eyes probing the trees and brush
about him

  the pines thinned and disappeared after
he had walked a few moments stanley
was coming into a small irregular clear-
ing rimmed with the scrubby trees and
underbrush afternoon sunlight made the
place look almost cheery yet strange
thoughts thrust into stanleys mind

  was john bellam actually being trans-
formed into a reptile were those ghastly
scales upon his skin but a forerunner of
the horror to come  had bellam as sha-
gar charged deliberately prodded the py-
thon into attacking the snake-man  could
the strangely reptilian circus owner actu-
ally talk with snakes speak their hissing
language had the police dog been at-
tacked by the python that had escaped
from kelleys shows or had it been
crushed by-john bellam-whose thin
scaled body was snakelike in its-

  a derisive laugh burst from stanleys
lips

  he was letting the queer happenings

break his nerve the whole thing was
sane enough-just a skin disease a crip-
pled and half-mad snake-man and an es-
caped python yet-

  underbrush rustled nearby and every
muscle in his bdy snapped taut his fin-
gers went white about the short club
bleak with a sudden almost numbing
fear his brown eyes probed between the
surrounding trees a slight movement
caught his eyes then a small bird darted
up from the ground the lawyer relaxed
and grunted as he realized that the mus-
cles of his jaws ached

  resolutely he started to whistle but he
stopped as he recalled reading somewhere
that reptiles were peculiarly susceptible to
shrill noises

  damn circuses and snakes after he
and mary were married-

  sudden horror held stanley motion-
less and the abrupt pounding of his heart
all but drowned the shrill scream ringing
in the narrow wooded valley

  it was the terrified scream of a man in
the maddening throes of infinite agony
it came again

  stanley stood rigid the cry was com-
ing from the right side of the valley it
knifed his eardrums again then stopped
choking short with a gurgling moan for
a moment the valley was gripped in awful
silence then stanley heard a heavy body
breaking through the brush to his left

  shagar weiss his voice sounded
queer-shrill in his ears he broke into
a stumbling run toward the sound his
fingers glued to the short club in his right
hand swaying tree branches plucked at
his clothing underbrush whipped at his
legs yet he stumbled on the horrible cry
still echoing in his brain

  after a few moments he stopped every
faculty concentrated on listening the
noise of breaking brush had ceased and
there was no sound but the throb of blood
in his ears the eerie whisper of wind in


terror tales

the trees about him he moved forward
cautiously his aching eyes probing the
brush

  a shapeless mass upon the ground some
distance ahead drew his gaze like a mag-
net cold horror swelled in his brain
waves of nausea swept over him and the
dread certainty that the shape was human
grew in his mind gritting his teeth to
steady jerking nerves he forced himself
toward the ghastly shape

  it was a man-a man whose body was
crushed into a mocking travesty of a
human form there were no definable
outlines to the horribly shapeless mass it
was but a ghastly huddle of crushed flesh
bone and blood-soaked clothing

  controlling himself with an effort
stanley forced himself to examine the
thing it was shagar the crippled snake-
man shagars features were bloated his
colorless eyes had burst from their sockets
-horrible globes pendant from red veins
and muscles trickles of blood streaked
his cheeks his mouth was fixed in a
grimace of agony the side of his head
was bruised his body was a blood-seep-
ing pulp john bellams mad words
flashed into stanleys chilled mind as he
stared down at the crushed snake-man

  the stunning impact of a lightning
thrust from overhanging branches the
anesthesia of fear then coil after coil
of steel-cabled body-

  stanley spun his right fist white about
the short dub cold prickles racing along
his spine

oomething had moved in the trees
 behind him he heard it again then
saw the figure of a man coming through
the underbrush

  stanley shagar cried elbert weiss
he broke from the trees and ran toward
stanley his face deathly pale my god
stanley  im glad youre unhurt i
heard-

  he saw shagars crushed body behind
the young lawyer and his black eyes went
wide filled with horror

  it-it-got shagar i was afraid it
was you i- he raked sweat from his
fprehead with shaking fingers i-

  he stopped froze into an attitude of
listening then stanley heard some one
plowing through the brush toward them

  hi elbert  shagar shouted her-
man kelleys big voice in a moment the
heavy-jowled showman came into sight
his big body crashing toward them
heard a gosh-awful screech and thought
mebbe id better see whats what you got
any idea what-

  then kelley saw shagars pulped body
holy god his voice was but a hoarse
croak the python-

  your python elbert weiss voice
was brittle

  my python hell i give the snake to
john kelley whipped about with sur-
prising swiftness and gripped stanley
austins arm you was a witness aus-
tin you got to say i give the snake to
john i aint responsible for-this his
bulging eyes fought clear of shagars
crushed figure

  howd you happen to come up here
swift thoughts clicked in stanleys mind

  you cant pull me in on this roared
kelley big hands clenching i left the
cottage stopped at the store and talked a
bit

  miss mary come in and i left started
across the valley in my car then i heard
the screech and come up and-

  you saw mary bellam at the store
the words exploded from stanleys lips

 sure she musta come down after
something it aint but a half-mile from
the cottage to- kelley stopped bulging
eyes following stanley as the young law-
yer whipped past him moving with a
swift ground-eating stride what-
where you-
embrace of the python



  to the cottage stanley flung the
words over his shoulder john bellams
up there alone and marys out where that
python can attack her i

  he increased his pace to a run heard
kelley and weiss pounding after him

  reaching the cottage stanley crossed
the front porch legs stiff cold horror
gnawing at his heart the place was quiet
with a queerly sinister silence kelley and
weiss burst from the trees about the cot-
tage and trotted toward the porch

  mary mr bellam

  the silent empty cottage seemed to
engulf stanleys call there was no an-
swering sound he pushed through the
open doorway striding toward the door
to the bellams room he heard weiss
and kelley on the front porch

  bellams room door was open and stan-
ley saw the bed at the first glance it
was empty the covers thrown back there
was no sign of bellams thin scaled fig-
ure mad thoughts churned in stanleys
mind

  we got to get together on this thing
elbert kelleys bull voice drifted in
from the porch weiss nasal tones an-
swered

  its now a case of getting- weiss
stopped then his voice was shrill and
high theres mary now coming up
the-

  stanley reached the front door as the
car neared the cottage kelley and weiss
were running toward the road mary bel-
lam seemed lost behind the wheel of the
big sedan her blue eyes went big and
frightened as she braked the car to a stop
weiss and kelley crowded to the opened
left window stanley strode across the
porch ran toward the car

  why did you leave mr bellam el-
bert weiss was reaching for the door
handle stanley caught his arm and pulled
him away

  you heard me give the damn snake to

john mary kelleys big head was thrust
through the opened window you got
to witness stanleys muscular hand
upon his shoulder stopped him the
young lawyer pulled kelley away from
the car

  take it easy you two

  stan something terrible has hap-
pened  marys slim hands were warm on
stanleys wrist uncle john sent me to
the store for cigars something has hap-
pened to him tell me stan

  she pushed the car door open and
stepped to the road frightened eyes seek-
ing the cottage door

  bellams gone blurted elbert weiss
long fingers clasping nervously the py-
thon killed shagar

  oh mary swayed against stanley a
dry sob choked in her throat

  weiss said stanley as his arm tight-
ened about marys quivering shoulders
suppose you take the car and notify the
sheriff and coroner

  coroner hell bellowed kelley we
dont want law in this yet well find
bellam and the python then holler cop
ill get a gang of show-hands

  before either stanley or weiss could
stop him kelley was in the bellam sedan
and had it swinging about heading down
the valley in a cloud of dust

  why the dirty- burning anger
flamed in elbert weiss black eyes as he
stared at the speeding car

  a deep frown creased austins broad
forehead and his lips tightened grimly as
he watched the sedan disappear around a
turn

  herman kelley was after bellams
greater circus he had been in the valley
when shagar screamed could the beefy
showman have planned to murder all but
one of bellams heirs before killing bel-
lam himself then buy the show from the
survivor  kelley didnt want the police-
yet could that mean he was using his


terror tales

supposed trip to maxton or show-hands
as a cover for another murder was john
bellam alive or had kelley watched the
cottage waited until bellam was alone
then-

  elbert austin

  the faint ory was coming from the
narrow valley behind the mountain cot-
tage and the eerie tones seemed to pluck
with chill fingers at stanleys nerves

  it-its uncle john mary bellams
clutching fingers dug into stanleys arm

  elbert r weiss was already running
toward the sound stanley started after
him mary dragging at his arm and as
they sped toward the narrow wooded val-
ley behind the cottage a dread certainty
grew in stanleys mind each one of
these strange happenings was but part of
a mad plan each incident was leading to
a hideous death-filled climax

  mr bellam

  he heard elbert weis running through
the brush ahead mary was stumbling
panting at his side

  stanley elbert

  john bellamys shrill cry came from
slightly to the left stanley changed his
course following elbert weiss helping
mary through the entangling underbrush

  then they saw the thin pajama-clad
figure of john bellam ahead through the
trees and stanley thought of a horrible
half-reptile creature wandering in the
wooded valley

tthey reached the circus owner and
again revulsion swept over stanley
austin as he looked at the dry scale-like
flakes of dead cuticle on bellams skin a
queer tightening came into the young law-
yers body

  something has happened to shagar
bellams narrow head thrust forward-as
he hissed the words the head of a scaled
reptile upon a thin upright body i
heard him scream it was like his scream

when he was attacked by the python
bellam pawed at his narrow forehead and
the dry rasp of scales sent prickles of
horror through stanleys tight scalp cir-
cus folks feel death bellams ophidian
eyes were unnaturally bright and unwink-
ing i know shagar is dead his thin
body swayed a queer sinuous movement
take me to his body

  stanley austin felt the hair rising upon
his head

  bellam had sent mary away from the
cottage he had been alone he hated
shagar had-according to the crippled
snake-man-prodded a python into attack-
ing him before bellam could have slipped
from the cottage crossed the valley and
-stanley shuddered shagar had said
bellam was half-snake could talk the hiss-
ing language of serpents shagar had pre-
dicted his own death in the crushing coils
of a snake he had said that bellam
would be that serpent had the crippled
snake-man possessed some horrible secret
knowledge about john bellatn had he
been crushed because of that knowledge 

  take me to shagar

  john bellaras thin figure weaved in a
loathsome serpentine movement his
sharp tongue licked pale lips avidly a
queer hungry gleam burned in his un-
winking eyes his cold fixed stare fas-
tened upon elbert weiss

  take me to shagar elbert he com-
manded hissingly

  weiss lifted muscular shoulders in an
expressive shrug turned and started off
through the trees heading for the spot
where stanley had found the crippled
snake-mans horribly crushed body

  muscles hard with a strange tautness
stanley followed mary walked at his
side her trembling hands clutching his
arm

  the sinking sun painted darkening
shadows in the narrow valley a slight
evening breeze had started and faint
embrace of the python



eerie whispers drifted through the trees-
stanley stopped warned by something
he could not define quickening blood
pumped in his ears his lips felt parched
and dry his right hand clenched-then
he remembered he had dropped his short
club near the cottage beside him mary
bellam stood stiffly her frightened breath
shrill in his ears he could feel her slim
figure trembling against him his bleak
eyes probed the trees ahead then the
something which had warned him became
apparent elbert weiss and john bel-
lams thin pajama-clad figure were no-
where in sight no sound came from the
trees and brash ahead

  slowly stanley moved forward fingers
knotted into hard fists mary walked at
his side held silent by his tenseness as
they passed a low mass of brush stanley
heard a furtive rustle behind him

  chilled breath stopped in his throat
the skin of his back crawled with sud-
den numbing horror and john bellams
strange words flashed into his mind

  the stunning impact of a lightning
thrust from overhanging branches the
anesthesia of fear then coil after coil
of steel-cabled body-

  instinctively he pushed mary away
from him and swung about his fists knot-
ted half-way around he was aware of
a vague something lashing out from the
brush a smashing weight crashed into
the side of his head

  lights flamed within his skull marys
terrified scream reached his ears seem-
ing to come from an incredible distance
a sable pall tightened about him

  something hard and round encircled his
body yet he couldnt move couldnt
scream the terror swelling in his lungs
merciful unconsciousness engulfed him

otanley austin became aware of
 a strange acrid smell a nerve-tighten-
ing odor that had a rank corrosive qual-

ity about it it was somehow unutterably
slimy and unclean then abruptly he
knew what it was-the nauseous stench
of reptiles

  his eyes snapped open and a startled
cry rushed to his lips and stopped he
was gagged bound hand and foot and
lying upon the rough stone floor of a
large cave to his right he could see
mary bellams slim figure the girl was
also bound and a gag bit into the soft
flesh of her cheeks she was unconscious
her eyes closed

  still dazed by the blow upon his head
stanley looked about him

  farther toward the back of the cavern
was a queer structure of heavy beams and
coils of heavy hawser-like rope he saw
a powerful hydraulic jack the shadowy
figure of a man was crouched behind the
crude machine stanley eyes swept past
the man drawn irresistibly toward the
back of the cave then the noisome gag
between his teeth flung back the scream of
horror that tried to burst from his tight
lungs

  the dusky shadows at the back of the
cavern held the coiled bulk of a giant
python

  he could see the sinuous coils of its
huge scaled body the blunt triangle of its
head its eyes made tiny points of light
in the shadows it seemed dormant yet
there was a certain pulsing of life about
the giant bulk

  stanleys eyes swung back to the
crouched shape of the man the crude ma-
chine and the hideous solution of the
whole mad scheme burst like a blinding
flame within his brain he knew now the
purpose of the ropes and beams knew the
identity of the kneeling man

  a ghastly vision of shagars crushed
body swam before his eyes he knew now
why he and mary had been brought to
this cavern

  frantically he tried to burst free of the


terror tales

ropes about his wrists warm blood
crawled upon his skin as the rough hemp
bit into his flesh

  he saw now that a mans head thrust
above the coils of hawser-like rope be-
tween the heavy beams the features
were all but obscured by the thick folds of
a gag yet stanley knew who it was-
john bellam

  stanley threw every ounce of his
strength into straining against the ropes
but they held fast a groan of despair
forced from his tight lips

  warned by the sound the figure
crouched behind the machine straightened
turned stanley knew his identity before
he rose it was elbert weiss

  wdl well marys brave lover is
awake a hacking laugh rasped from
weiss leering mouth kelley and his
show-hands will find plenty when they
come back

  weiss bent released the big hydraulic
jack and the thick ropes about bellams
thin figure loosened he pulled the shape
less mass that had been bellams body
from the machine flung it over his shoul-
der and stalked toward the front of the
cave theyll find bellam and you
crushed by the python and theyll find
marys body in the coila of my prize
beauty  he jerked his head toward the
rear of the cave i will own bellams
circus in a few months kelley and i
will consolidate-the greatest and big-
gest show on earth and ill own half of
it

  chuckling throatily weiss strode out
of the cave carrying bellams crushed
figure

  stanley tore at the ropes about his
wrists a rising sense of defeat beating at
his mind bellam was already dead
crushed in the hydraulic machine he and
mary would be next grinding his teeth
into the wadded cloth in his mouth stan-

ley tried to push the gag free tried to
shout then he heard weiss returning
its my turn now miss bellam
weiss stalked to marys bound figure
and stared down at her black eyes flam-
ing with mad hate marys eyes snapped
open filled with terror as she saw him

  youve looked on me as a bum and a
common circus hand ever since ive been
with bellams youve always avoided me
but you cant now weiss voice dripped
venom within ten minutes youll be
dead and ill own bellams show shagar
was easy he died without a struggle in
my machine but im saving the live snake
for you miss bellam ill watch and
laugh as it crushes you yaar lover can
watch too but he wont laugh hell be
fighting the ropes in my mechanical py-
thon i after you two are dead ill put
you and the python in the valley for kel-
ley and his men to find ill be at the
other end of the valley hunting for you
picking the girl from the floor weiss
carried her to the back of the cavern
dropped her upon the coiled python and
stepped back a mad snarling laugh bub-
bling from his lips

  the huge serpents angry hiss filled the
cave and stanleys eyes widened with hor-
ror as he saw the deadfy mottled body
sliding about mary enfolding her in its
ghastly embrace

  the young lawyer exploded in a mad
effort to burst the ropes about his hands
dropped back as his tortured muscles re-
belled under the strain the python had
looped two coils about marys slim fig-
ure one about her waist the other about
the fresh plumpness of her breasts the
girl was paralyzed with terror-the anes-
thesia of fear

  stanley tried to jerk erect and a sharp
projection of rock beneath him gouged
into his pressing hands cutting the flesh
abruptly he stiffened and new hope
flashed into his mind feverishly he
embrace of the python



lammed his bound wrists on the sharp
rock and a sob caught in his throat as
the hemp snagged on the projection in
less than a minute several strands of the
rope had parted

  weiss was standing near the python
unholy interest gleaming in his black eyes
as he watched the snake coiling about the
girl the serpents mottled body was
weaving slowly about mary one coit
had trapped her ankles another contracted
about her thighs even as stanley stared
tlte python looped another coit about the
girls shoulders and he could see steel-
cabled muscles crawling beneath the rep-
tils mottled skin as it tightened about its
terrified prey

  congested wood darkened stanleys
face as he put every atom of his strength
into the effort of freeing his hands hor-
ror-pent breath swelled his lungs

  driven fey sheer despair he strained at
the ropes flesh and bone threatened to
give away under the strain then abruptly
something snapped he felt the weakened
hemp slackened about his wrists madly
he clawed free of the bonds lurched to
his feet

  weiss spun and hurled his tall figure at
stanley as the latter stumbled toward
mary bellam the young lawyer met his
rush with a flying right fist that banged
squarely on weiss mouth the mad killer
swung his feet in a vicious kick that raked
skin from stanleys shins stanleys
right fist stabbed at weiss face again
connected and a sharp grinding pain shot
up to the lawyers right shoulder as he
felt hot blood gush over his knuckles
weiss shot toward the back of the cave
as though catapulted his muscular body
squirming as he tried to keep his balance
he smashed into the rock wall and
dropped to the floor still squirming

  stanley lunged for the hissing python
-weiss statement clamoring in his

brain a man could handle the big snake
his stiff fingers touched the reptile and
the scaly feel of its body sent waves of
horror through his lithe figure tearing
frantically at the engulfing coils he freed
marys shoulders stabbed at the reptiles
weaving head with bloody hands slug-
gishly it tried to trap him in its mottled
coils

  he fought free tore the slimy body
from about mary as sheer terror and
horror gave added strength to his jerking
musdes the girl was unconscious

  stanley pulled her free caught her limp
figure up in his arms and stumbled toward
the mouth of the cave the angry hiss of
the sluggish python echoing in his ears
a qtriek glanced showed him elbert
weiss rolling over trying to get to his
feet but stanley strode on mary bellam
in his arms

  the sound of underbrush breaking in
the woods nearby stopped him at the cave
mouth and in a second he saw herman
kelleys big bulk plowing through the
bushes toward the cave six thick-shoul-
dered huskies burst from the woods be-
hind the big show-owner all of them
carried ropes and club

  hi stan i brought the boys weh
find that-

  a shrill maddening scream burst from
the cave wjouth-the scream of a man
faced by unspeakable horror-and stan-
ley thought of elbert weiss almost hdp-
less the young lawyer shuddered

  what the-

  kelley stared at marys bound figure
his piglike eyes wide

  get your men in the cave kelley
stanley worked at the gag and rope about
mary bellams white flesh try to save
both of the snakes in there come up to
the cottage after you are through ill
explain the whole thing to the coroner and
the police

through too from many hidden places
and it was to me a cry from the heart
of cfiina

  i waited there in the sitting room of
liu ti for him to tell me why he had
asked me to come id have come to him
around the world and he knew it for

forty years my father had been his friend
and his fathers friend in chifia liu ti
and my father had been blood-brothers
had mingled their blood from cuts in their
strong right forearms

i too knew chftia i had spent all of
my boyhood and most of my young man-

terror tales

hood there and had learned to love it

  it is a dangerous thing i am asking
you to do gordon bais said liu ti

  i didnt answer i looked at his niece
gorgeous liu mei and knew that it had
to do with her did she know my secret
this liu mei did kwan tao know it
kwan tao the dusky stalwart young
chinese who stood beside her  i doubted
it i had never told it to a soul though
liu mei must have read it in my eyes
we had been children together had almost
grown up together her father had mar-
ried one of liu tis sisters and her fath-
er had been an american in the eyes of
her world and mine she was an eurasian
neither chinese nor foreign i looked
at her and thought of how cruel people
could be to one another

  in the veins of my niece said liu
ti almost in a whisper runs the proud
blood of kings

  she was the most gorgeous woman i
have ever seen her hair and eyes were
black and she had the delicate beauty which
must have been that of kwan yin god-
dess of mercy when she had been a
mortal walking the earth

  i am ready to do anything old friend
i said to liu ti

  i know there has always been a bond
between us and between thee and liu
mei you played together as children
now gordon bais take her away and
cherish her

i gasped in amazement i think my sur-
prise must have made me look ridiculous

  but kwan tao to whom you have
promised her-

  it can not come to pass just now
gordon a shadow of which i can give
you but the slightest hint hangs over the
houses of liu and kwan it means death
it whispers in the wind across the win-
dows it sighs in the fog it moans in the
sounds from the river take her away

with you quickly for you an american
it may be possible

  i looked at liu mei just to meet her
eyes had countless times caused my heart
almost to stop beating she didnt smile
her lips were white and terror was in
her face-as it was in the eyes of liu ti
and kwan tao

  there were beads of sweat on the fore-
head of liu ti and he was of the old
school one of those whose faces did not
change even under torture

  if i asked you gordon said liu mei
herself

  anything runt i said you know
that pd called her runt when we
had been brats together in canton but
what of kwan tao

  i looked at her fiance trying to figure
it out liu ti spoke again

  it is better you did not know liu
mei knows little which she may tell you
when she is safely away with one who
loves her later perhaps kwan tao-
the weirdness of chinatown of china
transplanted chilled me again i was
conscious of the dismal foghorns of the
creepy mist that swathed the windows of
the strange music from the heart of china-
town

  nobody will bother a foreigner be-
hind whom is the threat of the foreign
police said liu ti you will go forth
unmolested it will be thought that be-
cause all of the blood in her veins is not
chinese i have cast her out to become a
member of her fathers people

  i could see the scheme then and it
seemed mad yet perhaps the only one
that might work and i knew something
of the frightful fury of nameless shad-
ows in chinatown

  i shall guard her until i have word
from you as though she were my sister
-which almost she is

  it was knowing this that made me
send for you i have never asked before
a bride for death



   liu mei tall for a chinese girl dressed
in occidental garb came to me then smil-
ing a little and gave me her hand how
soft it was it made me think of a beat-
ing heart a birds heart perhaps beating
in the palm of the birds captor and
after liu mei came kwan tao with a
firm handshake which said more than
any words he could have uttered

hphe beating of my own heart almost
suffocated me as i stepped into the
hallway with liu mei and there was
sorrow too that was deeper than the wells
of shallajai i would have given my life
for this girl i could understand the great
love defying all prejudice all conventions
which must have bound this girls father
to her mother and now both were dead
and liu mei dwelt in the house of her
uncle and bore his name

  she put her hand on my arm as we
walked to the electric elevator liu tis
establishment combination office and resi-
dence was of five stories and the stairs
were almost never used for travel between
floors

   it suffocated me almost to stand in the
tiny elevator with liu mei surely she
must know and her eyes told me that she
did that she knew she might never men-
tion it i would never dare and because
i would never dare i blurted out

  ive always loved you liu mei my
greatest desire is for your happiness

  she was very close to me then and
her hand was still on my arm her per-
fume was in my nostrils like the radiant
ghost of herself that might go with me
always her eyes told me that she had
always known was it fancy or did i see
deep down in their depths some hint of
love returned i shook my head in the
shock of the near revelation to drive away
the image of the happiness that might have
been ours were it not for the insurmount-
able barriers of blood

  there will never be another liu mei
i said

  i pressed the button for the first floor
and the cage started down liu mei as
we passed the fourth floor reached out her
hand and turned off the light in the cage
i was alone in the dark with the woman
of all women whom i loved and for a
moment as the cage went creaking down
the knowledge held me paralyzed

  i had looked at my watch from force
of habit when we had entered the cage
ten minutes aiter eleven at night by
eleven-thirty i would have taken liu mei
to safety then i must bear my own
strange cross in patience until she was
taken from me fofever

  her hand had dropped from my arm
as though she were afraid of what i might
do in my madness and i locked my lips
tightly on whatever else desperation might
have made me say

  the first floor was just below us i
snapped on the light again mustered a
smile and turned to lead hef forth when
the cage stopped

  i couldnt believe my eyes the cage
hadnt stopped moving i would have
sworn to that hut lu mei was not with
me she had vanished out of a moving
elevator as though she had turned to fog
and eddied out through the grills into the
shaft

  nor was that all five stalwart men in
hideous devil masks had taken her place
i stared at them in amazement it couldnt
be-yet it was somewhere along the
route from the fifth floor to the first liu
mei had vanished and the five had taken
her place and the cage hadnt stopped
moving it had been magic

  where is she i demanded in shrill
frightened cantonese

  gone said one and it is an order
that the meddling foreigner be punished
so that never again will he be tempted to
meddle


terror tales

  the speaker pressed the button again
and the cage started to ascend they
stopped it between the third and fourth
floors as we went up i snapped a glance
at my watch it said eleven-thirty the
cage bearing liu mei and myself had
been twenty minutes descending

  the speaker turned out the light i must
have been paralyzed with fear and sur-
prise for i didnt even offer resistance
in the dark the hands of the devils
began upon me their feet came into
use too they kicked me they clawed
me they battered away at me they
ripped clothing from me with their knives

  finally when it seemed i could stand
the agony no longer something heavy
struck the top of my head the cage
was filled with shooting stars as the bot-
tom seemed to fall out of it dropping me
headlong into the shaft where i struck to
find oblivion black as the deepest night

  when i regained consciousness i was
sprawled outside the elevator on the
ground floor the outer door of course
was closed fog seeped through under it
to be absorbed by the lights i was alone
in a building filled with echoes and hor-
ror my hellish assailants were gone

  i staggered to my feet my head was
splitting i ached in every bone and mus-
cle i was a six-footer who should have
been able to put up a terrific battle but the
five had handled me with ease giving me
the most brutal beating any man had ever
had to take

  the seeming miracle of the twenty-
minute descent the vanishing of liu
mei the appearance of the five did not
puzzle me as it might have any one who
did not know the potentialities of chinese
master mummers as i did

  i didnt leave though as the five or
those who had sent them must have ex-
pected they did not know my feeling
for liu mei which would have sent me
nto the pit itself

  i rang for the elevator again i
crawled into it wondering what sort of
hell would breathe its brimstone into it
this time and went back to the fifth floor
the door to the apartment of liu ti was
open i crossed the threshold my terror
mounting

  there was nobody here but liu ti and
what i might have said to him would never
now be said he was dead he hung by
a silken cord from a beam of his living
room his face was a mask of horror
his bulging eyes stared right at me as
though he said

  by the bond which existed between
your father and me gordon bais i com-
mand you to stand by my niece and her
betrothed until the end

chapter two

tiny shoes

tery carefully and reverently i cut
the cord which hung liu ti to the
beam and lowered him to the floor i had
closed the outer door then i now went
systematically through all the rooms not
another soul was in the place living or
dead yet he had had a sister here a
wife and a brother now all were gone

  and i by virtue of being my fathers
son was a part of this family i had been
spared i knew because i was not chi-
nese but if i did not refrain from med-
dling my recent captors had said and
had proved by their manhandling my
white blood would not save me from their
sinister designs right now i could have
sworn scores of eyes were watching me
studying me waiting-

  the family of liu ti was gone he
at least would never know if i went out
this very minute into the street and left
chinatown never to return what had i
to do with the chinese maybe in the
final analysis i loved that part of liu
a bride for death



mei which was of my own race maybe
i was blinded by my lave of china where
i had spent so many years maybe when
my own people looked upon love between
the raees with revulsion they were right
maybe- well if i went away now i was
safe they had satd so if i stayed the
beating i had taken would be horribly
little compared to what they could do to
me

  but lin meis father had been white
and ray own fathers friend i knew what
my dad if he had been living would have
done- and i knew what my own heart
dictated i stooped over liu ti then and
whimpered

  they wont get away with it old-
timer i satd not while im alive

  he couldnt hear me of course-or
coum he his face didnt change ex-
pression but somehow i knew that he
knew-had perhaps known from the be-
ginning

  helfs bells the love between mei and
me was the sort of thing which might de-
velop between any boy and gif who
reared together had never been allowed
to know what the outside world thought
o what it cruelly called mixed love it
was just that nothing more to me she
was a chinese and the sooner i forgot
about her the better bat even as these
traitorous thoughts went through my
brain like black lightning flashes i seemed
to see liu mei standing before me her
eyes calm filled with the knowledge of
the ages as they stared into mine and
said

  it isnt like you gordon 

  and it wasnt why should human be-
ings draw back from one another be-
cause of race or color or religion

  i knew then that nothing would ever
change me not even when the time came
as it probably would when i would be put
to torture for my meddling

  without a backward glance i hurried

from the room of liu ti and into the
hallway i had last traversed with liu mei

  somewhere between the fourth ftooi
and the first i told myself the strange
thing happened i must find which floor
ill start with the fourth for it was
there that liu mei afraid of being spied
upon had turned out the light

  i went down in the elevator it pleased
me to defy the enemy in this much at
least i stopped at the fourth floor and
got out shutting the door behind me i
was in another hallway brilliantly lighted
i began to move along it my eyes study-
ing every inch of space i had the feeling
that somehow liu mei would drop some-
thing that would let me know that would
point the way to the pfeice i might find
her but there was nothing i went back
to the elevator

  i hadnt seen a soul and the echoes of
my own footfalls had taken on sinister
meaning in the deserted hallway they
seemed to be shouting to me to go back
to run fo cease trying to pry into the
dark secrets of chinatown

  i started to open the elevator door but
it would not open my heart stopped for
a moment since i had left the cage
some one had signaled for it and it had
gone-down or up viciously i jabbed
the button-and heard the whirring of the
cage from below there was something
horrible in that whirring what would i
see when i opened the door of the cage
who had signaled it  had that one known
what i was doing eyes watched me
now i knew it they would watch me
as long as i was in chinatown and wher-
ever i went out of chinatown until the
tortuous chinese minds were satisfied that
the affair of liu ti and kwan tao and
lru mei had been settled according to the
relentless chinese code

  the cage stopped at my floor i yanked
open the door i dont know what i ex-
pected to find certainly not what i did


terror tales

find liu san brother of liu ti standing
in a corner of the cage rigidly erect his
black eyes staring into mine

  there was the haft of a knife sticking
out of his left breast his right hand
was clutched about the haft cold chills
raced along my spine he was dead he
had to be dead with the knife in him like
that but why did he stand upright and
why was he in the cage now when it had
been empty the last time i had seen it
or had it the last three words were
almost a cry of terror had he been there
with me during my recent descent from
the fifth floor to the fourth if he had
i hadnt known it yet i knew it was
possible

  i would have screamed but knew it use-
less a hundred murders could have been
committed here and none outside the
wiser-as long as the victims were chi-
nese a white man disappearing would
be sought

  i stepped into the cage which quivered
a little and touched the body of liu san
instantly it toppled sidewise crashing
stiffly to the floor the corpse was already
rigid

  had this body been sent to me as a
warning i didnt know but i did know
that some one listened-many some ones
-and watched i shouted knowing that
my words went ringing up and down the
shaft and out through the grills at all
five floors

  so help me god ill bring every one
responsible for this to justice-and ill
slay them with my bare hands if any harm
comes to liu mei

  of course it was foolish no sooner
had i shouted the echoes ringing all
through the empty building than i knew
just how foolish it was on the hallway
of the floor above me i could hear the
scuffling of sandaled feet on the floor
below i could hear it too all through
the building

  i slammed the door dropped down to
the next floor and this time i left the
door open so that only by coming to this
floor could any one use the elevator and
id be in the hallway where i could see
whoever approached i was fighting mad
and more frightened than i had ever been
for liu mei mostly i told myself and
didnt fool myself at all i remembered
the kiss and caress of chinese knives
and knew that i would feel them again

  liu mei perhaps was feeling them
now

  i searched this hallway too and found
nothing then i went back to the ele-
vator no one had approached it for re-
peatedly i had looked back to make sure

  i started to step into the cage

  the body of liu san had vanished in
its place reposed the dead body of liu
tis sister around her neck the mate of
the cord which had strangled liu ti the
elevator had become an instrument of hell-
ish black magic two people had been
slain in it within the last fifteen minutes
or slain elsewhere and dumped into it for
me to find by some means i couldnt even
guess at

  i was like an automaton geared to run
a certain distance in a straight line i
couldnt wouldnt turn back or change
my course in one iota come hell or high
water i dropped down to the second floor
still seeking the trail of liu mei

  this had to be the last floor for i had
come to on the first floor to find liu mei
missing

  i stepped fearfully over the supine body
of liu tis sister into the hallway and
almost at once like eyes of cats blinking
in the dark i saw the shoe it was a tiny
shoe and i recognized it at once one
of liu meis set with the brilliants that
peeped forth so alluringly from under the
hem of her gown when she walked

  it seemed to call to me beseechingly

  it seemed to plead
a bride for death



  it seemed to threaten to challenge me

  it took all of my courage to walk down
the hallway to that single shoe to stare
down at it it rested on its side at the
top of a flight of stairs it was liu meis
shoe without a doubt she had kicked it
off for me to find or had she maybe her
captors had left it there to lead me to
destruction what would happen to me
if i picked it up and went with it down
the stairs those stairs strangely were
ominously black filled with ebon fore-
boding of disaster to come

  the whole building seemed to have
fallen silent to listen-to what to the
beating of my own terrified heart 

  i wouldnt take the black stairs they
led down to the first floor id take the
elevator stubbornly as i had taken it
hitherto this time i expected to find
that some other horror had developed in
my absence

  but no the door of the cage was still
open and the sister of liu ti still
sprawled supine on the floor

  i started to shut the door when the cry
came-shrill piercing filled with agony
and with terror

  gordon gordon bais

  the cry came from the depth of that
black stairwell whence steps led down into
god knew what that it had been the
voice of liu mei i knew for a certainty
as i raced for the stairs

  and scarcely had the echoes of my
footfalls started in the hallway again than
it came once more with something added

  gordon go back go back dont
fol-

  and there it broke short off and i knew
that a hand had closed tightly over her
mouth-a dirty hand a grimy chinese
hand like the hands which had beaten me
smelly hands hands which it were sacri-
lege to use upon the person of liu mei
if i could get my hands on the fellow who
had stopped her even for touching her

i would tear his heart out with steely fin-
gers i didnt realize she had warned me
back until i had plunged headlong into
the black stairwell-to be swallowed by a
darkness redolent with the odor of in-
cense and liu meis perfume

  i saw her then vanishing into the hall-
way on the first floor around the corner
of the stairwell below carried backward
upright in the big arms of two huge men
whose faces i could not see but which i
knew were devil-masked

  something struck me at the base of
the skull and i rolled down the rest of
the stairs numb from the blow but know-
ing as i rolled that my attacker was right
behind coming to strike me again

  i hit the bottom and fought for the
strength to meet him when he reached me

chapter three
where is liu mei

my whole body as i dragged stub-
bomly to my feet seemed to be made
of lead my arms were unbearable bur-
dens my legs were almost too heavy to
drag under me my neck was stiff almost
immovable as i twisted it by great effort
of will to face the man who came down
the stairs behind me

  a chinese of course and a huge one
wearing a devils mask i couldnt have
handled him man for man had i been
in full possession of my faculties and he
unarmed as matters stood i was on my
feet but out helpless and he carried a
club in both hands he wore the queue
most unusual in a modern chinese and
it looked like a snake above his mask

  his teeth were showing in a snarl or a
grimace of murderous amusement he
was like something out of a nightmare i
raised my hands or tried to to ward off
the blow he was sending at my skull but
my hands wouldnt move and the blow
m

tbrror tales

landed it landed with a dull sound as
though he had struck the head of a drum
and i scarcely felt it at all

  that one thing told me how close i
was to death he had brought the chib
down with both hands i had tried to pull
my head out of the way i think the blow
was a glancing one it must have been
else it would have driven my head down
into my shoulders

  he came at me striking again my right
shoulder    well i think it was almost
broken by that first blow i had no de-
fense whatever except my wits

  and a certain knowledge of cantonese
now i used the latter knowledge and
heard sing-song words burble madly
through my lips-lips that felt thick as
untanned leather the figure of the chi-
nese danced before my eyes until there
seemed to be two of him as i spoke the
words

  i must get to liu mei she has done
nothing what will they do to her

  his answer was so strange that for a
long moment i did not understand him

  you know the ancient cantonese cus-
tom of the broken urn 

  urn urn i repeated what has
liu mei to do with urns 

  this he answered falling back a lit-
tle because i had managed to lift my left
foot against him to keep him from getting
too close that a chinese husband ex-
pects his wife tb come to him as foreign-
ers call it clean if he finds it is not
so he sends her back to her father on a
rattling cart with a broken urn swinging
below--a broken urn surrounded by bits
of metal that dink

  the horror of it drove most of the
numbness out of me then and there  i
loved the -chinese always had the bad
with the good but had never been able to
think of their heartlessness to women
without a shudder of revulsion

  but liu mei can not thus be sent

back again that horrible rattling in my
throat which i could scarcely recognize
as my own voice speaking cantonese
there is no finer more suitable woman
anywhere

  that is true he said at the moment
but when we have finished with her-

  he left it there and i knew the full
meaning of his horrible fang-showing
grimace liu mei was to be given to
these monsters she was being taken away
to that fate eyen as we spoke afterward
kwan tao being a chinese could no
more have taken her to wife than he could
have denied his belief in gods and devils
on the rivers of his native land it wasnt
the first time a fragile delicate chinese
woman had been given to a mob

  and here was i numb with hurt un-
able to stop this unspeakable horror and
liu mei already gone nothing had hap-
pened to her so far only because her cap-
tors must first make sure of me they
had no desire for foreign police to
break in on them

  i cried out in agony i was a desperate
savage man at that moment who couldnt
be hurt any more whether i loved liu
mei or not id have gone to help her be-
cause she was a woman and her captors
blood-mad brutes

  my desperation lent power to my hands
my feet i lunged at my attacker with my
head down like a football player smash-
ing the line again his club crashed
down on me this time i took most of
the terrific blow on my shoulderblades
but almost intolerable pain shot through
my entire body then my head crashed
into the mans stomach he was taken by
surprise by a form of attack new to him
and went violently backward to the floor
striking his head with a sickening thud
the dub rolled from his hands

  i saw it and resolved that whatever
happened to liu mei none of it would
be because of this man at my feet
a bride for death



  i picked up the club i remembered
the blows which had crashed against my
skull  i must have been mad a beast
in my own right

  with all my power i smashed the club
down on his head just as he lifted it
from the floor as it struck the top of
his skull i felt the club sink in or the
wood give and his head dropped back
soddenly upon the floor

  something red and sinuous like a crim-
son snake crept out from his mask slug-
gishly crawling

   still with the club in my hand i whirled
and ran sluggishly along the way those
two had gone with liu mei i scarcely
realized that the blood from my own
wounds was streaming down my cheeks
until i tasted its salt on my lips

  another flight of stairs led down into
darkness  i didnt hesitate

t crashed down those stairs and

  from that moment on what happened
was a kind of blur there were masked
men on the stairs and i struck at them
savagely with all my power i felt the
club crack against skulls cheeks against
bodies i rammed the end of it into bel-
lies but i allowed none of this to stay
my headlong plunge down those stairs

  it was dark that basement where i
struck the bottom of the stairs but far
ahead of me i saw a faint glow of light
and i knew that i was somewhere in the
labyrinth under chinatown-that maze of
tunnels and passageways which no white
man ever sees

  there were men behind me but they
feared my bloody swinging club be-
sides i was mouthing weird cries which
sounded insane even to me-and chinese
have dread respect for the insane

  knowing this the inspiration came to
pretend insanity to keep it up until the
last if theyd realize that insane or not
 yras aiming directly at the freeing of

liu mei they would know i was not mad
but if i acted fast enough they wouldnt
have time to think

  i came to that glow of light it was a
tunnel mouth and in the tunnel i dashed
to the first turning even here i could see
that it led to another basement and a
vast room outfitted with gaudy lavishness
the room was filled with coolies scores
of them standing facing their master
with becoming servility masked heads
bowed

  there was one man on a dais a man
in gorgeous robes with a black cap on
his head topped by a red coral button
he wore the five-strand beard of venerable
wisdom and there was no smile on his
lips nor mask upon his face bound
gagged fastened to a column which up-
held the roof stood kwan tao he was
struggling with hie bonds his eyes were
shooting flames

  i stared at him as i ran he was naked
to the waist and his torso was a mass of
blood kwan tao had been beaten with
the bamboo until his skin and flesh had
been shredded his chest was crimson and
dripping and horrible it made me think
of the ghastly death of a thousand cuts
 but i know kwan tao wasnt think-
ing of those wounds those ghastly wounds
which would have killed a white man

  standing between two coolies before
the man on the dais was liu mei

  her face was deadly white but she
stood proudly erect like a soldier i saw
the lips of the man on the dais and they
were moving but what the man said i
couldnt make out yet i was close enough
to have heard

  i saw the lips of liu mei move in an-
swer i saw her head thrown back as
though she flung defiance into the lace
of the seated man his face was twisted
into bestial lines as he listened but why
couldnt i hear what was being said  had


terror tales

something happened to my senses as the
result of the beatings i had taken

  the whole thing was utterly weird it
was like watching a silent motion picture
and hearing not even the machine which
ran it yet all of these people were alive
unless i were looking into a vast mirror
which seemed impossible

  the man on the dais suddenly rose
shot out his hand and slapped lia mei
twice once on either side of the face so
hard that i thought her head would be
knocked from her shouiders i knew that
she screamed for i could see her mouth
open but i heard no sound the chinese
master stood there in his wrath and i
knew that he heaped that wrath upon this
woman who defied him

  her uncle his sister-and god knew
who else-had already paid the penalty for
something i had seen two-a sister and
a brother of liu ti-and knew some of
the answer when any chinese tribunal
sentenced a man to death his whole fam-
ily died with him for what good did it
do to destroy the tiger and spare the
cubs

  only kwan tao they had spared for
the moment at least but in the end he
would go the same way just now though
they wished hifn to know to the full the
humiliation to be visited upon liu mei

t had the most terrible feeling as i

  hurled myself toward this ghastly tab-
leau that i was a man in a nightmare
with someone i loved in danger and my
own feet rooted to the ground so that i
could not move while death raced upon
me from the rear

  it was like swimming in glue my for-
ward march because of my weakness my
feet drummed against the tunnel floor but
seemed to take me forward not at all my
club was almost too heavy to hold i
had to clutch it with all the strength of
my two hands

  i wondered if liu mei didnt know i
was here trying my best to get to her-
if only that i might slay her myself to
save her from what the monsters would
do to her did she guess as though in
answer to my thought she turned and
looked directly at me i thought her right
hand lifted palm toward me as though
she would order me to get back to save
myself

  but she couldnt possibly have seen me
i knew that instantly and yet in some
strange fashion she must have known i
was there trying my best to reach her

  i whirled there where hideously
masked faces all around me chinese
blocking my retreat had i wished to re-
treat they didnt offer to touch me again
they merely laughed horrible cackling
laughter which shook their bodies with
their ghoulish glee-and they were laugh-
ing at me

  i whirled hurled myseif forward again
i struck something an invisible mysterious
something in full stride and it knocked
me flat on my back stunning me again
i almost lost my club    and all around
me they laughed and chattered i scram-
bled to my feet felt in the air for what-
ever it wa that had knocked me down

  my hands came in terrifying contact
with an expanse of spotlessly clean glass
of such dimensions that it shut me in the
tunnel entirely--yet let me see the horror
of the room beyond

chapter four

hell below

tifany things were made plain to me
in that one agonizing moment i
knew or guessed something of what must
have happened coming down in the ele-
vator liu mei and i had -passed a floor
just after some sort of volatile drug hid-
den in the odor of incense perhaps had
a bride for death



been blown through the grill it had in-
stantly rendered both of us inanimate
the cage had automatically stopped at the
ground floor where i had been taken out

  then the enemy on the other floor had
pressed the signal and the cage had gone
back up bearing liu mei helpless un-
conscious of what was happening to her
into the hands of her enemies

  i had awakened in the cage again and
had been beaten horribly because i was too
numb and stupid from the drug to fight
back

  why had the chinese gone about their
work in so elaborate a fashion when a
single knife thrust would have done for
me and left liu mei in their hands
there seemed at the moment just one ex-
planation the one i had given myself
they played with me to keep me from
going out and bringing the white police
and they didnt kill me solely because
they didnt know for sure that i hadnt
told police to come looking for me if i
didnt reappear in a certain length of
time

  and this glass in the tunnel shutting
me off from the room beyond i could
imagine why it was there not for my
personal and special confounding but so
that enemies of this unholy group or peo-
ple who doubted its power might see what
the monsters were capable of doing

  i couldnt go forward the tunnel be-
hind me was packed with chinese

  knowledge of my plight drove me mad
in a few moments something terrible
would happen to liu mei i had to reach
her

  i think desperation must have given me
the strength of many men i stepped back
from that expanse of glass i felt my
biceps bulge power unimaginable power
seemed to swell and distend my every
nerve and muscle

  the world whirled

  the tunnel spun

  i hurled myself at that glass i didnt
feel my hurts it was as though my anger
had nullified my agony sweat dripped
from me the salty sweat of a cornered
brute beast

  my club crashed against that glass with
all the power i had as it did every face
and every mask in the room beyond was
turned toward me liu mei turned and
her hand went to her mouth her eyes
were big with terror

  a great jagged star showed in the glass
i felt someone hurl himself at me from
behind i spun swung instinctively lifted
my aim a little and crashed ray stick in
the mans mouth it must have knocked
out every tooth m his head he turned a
back somersault into the press behind him

  but i didnt even wait to see him strike
among his fellows

	i whirled back to the glass again seiz-
ing the split seconds left before the enemy
behind overpowered me the first crash
of my bludgeon against the glass had
sounded like the crack of doom

  the second was even worse for slivers
of glass broke free and clattered into the
tunnel in jagged shards while others fell
in the room beyond berserk now un-
stoppable desperate with terror i swung
and swung again

  i smashed through the opening was
small but i stepped back and hurled my-
self through it just the same jagged
points like a thousand swords struck me
caught at my clothing ripped my flesh i
was sobbing and cursing

  i would reach liu mei i would free
kwan tao

t staggered to my knees beyond the

   glass turning a little to see the smaller
chinese coming through the glass after
me

  i paused just a moment to crack down
on the skulls of the first two i did not
spare my strength and there were other


terror tales

splatters of crimson on the glass when i
again swung back to the occupants of
that hateful room my enemies in the
tunnel aghast that one man could be so
murderously destructive and drawn back

  now i could hear the voices of the men
in the room i had so violently and madly
entered

  the man on the dais

  seize the girl take her to the room
beyondj half the coolies with her the
other half here to slay this meddler v

  the coolies divided as though they had
already been instructed kwan tao a
bleeding horror tugged without cessation
at his bonds the man on the dais scarce-
ly moved nor did the expression on his
face change

  coolies jumped between the girl and me
through their ranks i saw the others
bearing the girl to the other room i had
no trouble guessing what would happen
there

  but no damned coolies could keep me
from reaching her

  i swung into that first group with all
my desperate fury one went down with
a smashed skull i heard the man on the
dais sheut 

  the first man to break ground before
i bid him dies by ray hand

  i snapped a glance over my right shoul-
der the man on the dais gripped a snub-
nosed automatic in his right hand

  another chinese went down despera-
tion drove the other coolies as they stood
shoulder to shoulder to fight me off there
were still more coming through the glass
behind me i knew but i didnt take
time to turn

  i swept die heavy end of that club
along the faces of my enemies not to
land solidly but to graze and maim and
smash the effect was horrible the now
bloody masks askew

  it was like running the end of a stick
along a picket fence save that the result

was bloody horror and i cried out
shrilly all the tftne i saw the door be-
yond them open liu mei cast one de-
spairing look over her shoulder at me as
the coolies bore her into that room out
of which a faint light came then she
was gone and the smirking coolies with
her and hell had never spawned a fury
such as i became

  i swung again-and missed completely
and this was the reason the man
on the dais had said

  enough let him try to reach iter
now you are too late gordon bais by
the time you could rip down that door-
he didnt have to finish it i hurled
myself toward the door but my mind was
not on that objective it held a picture of
the automatic gripped on the knee of the
master of all this horror i couldnt reach
him bullets would travel too fast his
eyes would be following every move i
now made i had his location fast fixed
in my mind i must make no slightest
error of judgment and i did not al-
most at the door i whirled like a dervish
and the blunt-ended club sped from my
hands with all my power and with all the
skill- that sometimes comes to a man in
a desperate place

  it went like a shot directly for the chest
of the man on the dais his mouth opened
to scream but the sound never got out
his right hand half swung toward me
but he didnt have time to pall the trigger

  the blunt club struck him in the chest
and bones and cartilage must have given
back before the hurtling projectile the
man toppled backward from his dais i
was right behind my strange weapon of
offense while the coolies slow thinkers
almost incapable of executing anytlring
without the command of some superior
stared at me like so many yellow statues
only their eyes moved

  i grasped the unconscious leader by the
throat yanked him to his feet
a bride for death



  i shook him i had to bring him to i
grabbed at his automatic held it in my
right hand so that its muzzle menaced the
wall of coolies who now surrounded me

  make one move against me i said
hoarsely and ill twist this mans head
from his shoulders

  they knew i meant it and this man
was their rice their living their master
no move was made by any one the man
was coming around

  where is the key to that room  i de-
manded if i dont get it ill still kill
this monster

  nobody spoke the unconscious man
couldnt

  kwan tao still struggled with his
bonds i snapped at the nearest coolie in
whose belt was a knife

  loose his gag cut his bonds

jvto coolie had ever obeyed a mas-
ter more quickly kwan tao stepped
free his face his whole body had been
so harshly tortured that it was next to
impossible to recognize him

  where is the key kwan tao i de-
manded

  on his left wrist hidden under the
sleeve

  i found it fastened by a thong i
yanked it free breaking the thong but
only after it had cut deeply into the mans
flesh i dragged him to the door i com-
manded kwan tao to hold him there  

  if anything has happened to her i
said this man will wish to god he had
never been born

  kwan tao didnt answer me he
merely stared his lips worked spasmodi-
cally his face was a gargoylesque red
mask

  take this gat i snapped again and
see that the coolies dont follow us into
the room

  i twisted the key in the lock the door
opened protestingly from inside it driv-

ing me to madness came sounds which
were like a womans moans of terror
then words in shrill cantonese in liu
meis voice

  turtles sons of turtles eggs of tur-
tles  how dare you lay hands on a daugh-
ter of kings

  and one voice making answer
daughter of kings true but damned
to eternity by mingling with the blood of
a barbarian  even your ancestors would
say that what befalls you will be less than
you deserve

  then i was inside with kwan tao be-
side me dragging the man i had all but
slain and what a tableau met my eyes
liu mei backed against a far wall much
of her upper garments tom away her
head was back her shoulders were stiff
with pride her right hand held a knife
poised its point aimed at her own heart

  the masked coolies were closing on her
in a tight semi-circle like hyenas to the
kill

  drop it liu mei snapped some one
out you curs back with your own
the crimson kwan tao was the
spokesman liu mei dropped the knife
the chinese slunk past us like beaten
mongrels

  kwan tao while relief began to surge
through me shut the door locked it put
his back against it

  kwan tao grinned a savage red grin
the man he had dragged in with him
had vanished maybe he had been play-
ing dead maybe well the fact remained
that between the second kwan tao
shoved him against the wall and closed
the door the man had snapped into con-
sciousness and had slipped out behind
kwan tao

  kwan tao hadnt closed the door

  it had been closed from outside and
all three of us were prisoners

  we bungled it said kwan tao but
maybe it is just as well


terror tales

  he stared at liu met as i did her
face would never be whiter she had
plainly been through hell i wanted to
ask her what had happened chinese are
to us brutally frank kwan tao asked
her before i could

  those coolies  did they-

  have coolies ever in all our history
asked liu mei bitterly failed to take ad-
vantage of women captives

  she didnt mince words i saw the face
of kwan tao change as no torture had
ever been able to make it change no
chinese of his station could possibly ig-
nore the law of the broken urn

  i broke in on the grim impassable
thing that had come between kwan tao
and the woman both of us loved

  will some one kindly tell me the
meaning of all this

  i will said kwan tao and i must
hurry for we have little time

  little time i repeated

  yes for even now the snaky tendrils
of the yellow smoke comes into this cham-
ber from the room of hell beyond

  the flowery language of the high-born
chinese did not desert him even now i
whirled and saw the yellow smoke yel-
low tentacles of it coming in through the
keyhole making one think of an inept
smoker trying to blow rings

  i choked it already had me by the
throat

chapter five

chinese blank walls

t ixj ti said kwan tao speaking
very rapidly wished me to take
liu mei in marriage i wished it too
proud to have for wife the daughter of
chinese kings but the tong said no liu
ti defied the tong they threatened us
ajll with death if liu ti persisted in his
defiance liu ti thought you might help

this is the result and now my two good
friends here we are altogether with but
a few minutes of life left to us

  he didnt go toward liu mei i knew
that centuries of tradition held him apart
from her modern america would have
ridden in its youth over any such barrier
as convention had reared between these
two especially when the fault was not
with liu mei

  kwan tao spoke to her

  i loved you from the bottom of my
heart liu ti

  i know her voice was harsh but
if we were to escape from this pit you
would never again so much as touch my
hand

  he didnt nod he couldnt he didnt
shake his head there was no answer he
could give because liu mei had already
given it

  i love you too liu mei have always
loved you i said

  one might as well speak truly on the
brink of the grave where there was noth-
ing to win or lose

  i loved you both said liu mei
speaking as one already dead and now
i die alone it is so unutterably lonely

  i didnt tell them even if there had
been time what had befallen their people
they must have guessed anythow they
knew their own kind

  i whirled on kwan tao

  go to her tao i choked take her
in your arms what can it matter now
when death is so close

  he looked at her and did not move in
the ear of my mind i could hear a creaky
cart on the streets of canton with a tin-
kling broken urn swinging below it i
could see liu mei white oj face sitting
on that cart jeered at by multitudes along
the narrow muddy streets

  the thought almost broke my heart

  i started toward liu mei and couldnt
make it my feet didnt work properly
a bride for death



i staggered almost falling away over to
the right the wall was jumping at me
i couldnt lift my arms to ward it off
it struck me in the face knocking me flat
i rolled to my side looked at kwan tao
he was staring his face a mask of agony
at liu mei but he hadnt taken a step
toward her

  now he swayed like a tree in a hurri-
cane as the drug which was slaying all
three of us got in its deadly work

  i got to my feet finally and it was like
lifting a mighty weight i slid against the
wall trying to shove myself toward liu
mei she was watching me and her eyes
thanked me it must have been terrible
to a delicately nurtured woman to die like
this with two men who knew what a
dreadful thing had happened to her

  i finally reached her

  i put my arm around it it was like
trying to lift an arm of lead i sagged
against the wall a yellow film now
stretched between kwan tao and me
through which he seemed still to sway
his eyes were still fixed on liu mei

  i thought he was talking but there was
a ringing in my ears so that i was none
too sure

  daughter of kings blood of kings
i thought he was saying defiled by
dregs from the rottenest gutters of china-
town how can i-

  i turned to liu mei

  it wouldnt matter to me darling i
whispered my whisper a sobbing kind of
gasp i know you couldnt help it i
would take you in my arms hold you
forever and wed both forget

  she whispered back

  how good it is to know that gordon
bais on the brink of the eastern
heaven

  shfe like kwan tao used the flowery
speech in a crisis she was all chinese
save that her coloring was almost as light

as my own she to me was an american
girl

  i tried to hold her more tightly but
both of us were swaying and i was trying
to grip the smooth cold wall with the
fingernails of my free hand i felt the
nails slide along the stone i heard them
like a thin screaming in my ears these
weird impressions told me that hashish
at least in part was in the yellow smoke
which destroyed us

  there was nothing ahead of us but
death

  i turned to face liu mei maybe by
slapping her by shaking her head i could
keep her awake soon the enemy would
open the door then perhaps i could
hurl her out save her

  but god help me i couldnt manage
my hands and arms all my strength
could not lift them i couldnt even take
my arm from about the proud graceful
shoulders of liu mei

  we were all three doomed this was
the end

  i swayed we swayed together and i
think liu mei held me up once or twice
when i would have fallen my eyes
seemed to bulge as i looked at that locked
door so that the thin tendrils of yellow
smoke became as large as full-bodied py-
thons-yellow hideous nightmare py-
thons shoving their coils through a gar-
gantuan keyhole to quest for the three
of us

  i tried again to tell liu mei that it
didnt matter but now no words would
pass my lips my vocal cords would no
longer serve me

rthen unaccountably i was down on
the floor on my belly i couldnt
rise again i couldnt wriggle my fingers
beside me liu mei was standing with her
feet wide apart proudly trying to die
erect

  the yellow film was everywhere


terror tales

  kwan tao still stood weaving sway-
ing looking at liu mei

  she must have been looking at him too

  but she preferred me i was sure of
that

  it was something to take with me into
the hereafter where our heavens would
not cross and we should never meet
again unless the white of liu mei came
to my heaven

  how silly it was but the yellow smoke
caused it

  and then my heart seemed to stop beat-
ing for a moment i was losing liu mei
perhaps i had never had her her love
yes a strange kind of love but part of
my life now the two of them kwan tao
and liu mei staggering almost falling
were moving toward each other

  i saw them meet

  his hands by some superhuman power
which i did not share because i could not
move mine at all went out to her they
caught her left arm drew the hand
through his elbow they stood side by
side with this strange chinese handclasp
-which was the signal of foregiveness
of close harmony of souls

  and then though both knew american
kisses because both had known the free-
dom of american schools they were both
all china

  they were rubbing their cheeks togeth-
er because the true chinese did not kiss

  they locked in each others arms
then they fell as a tree falls and though
i saw them strike the hard floor i did not
hear them because of the ghastly roaring
in my ears

  they fell sprawled supine but held
fast in each others arms and my spirit
writhed in agony as they fell for i knew
that in those last minutes both had for-
gotten there had ever been such a one as
gordon bais

  i took that awful strange agony with
me into abysmal darkness where there

was nothing but the niagara-like roaring
in my ears

  darkness through which shot long ten-
drils of yellow smoke engulfed me

i regained consciousness in an ele-
vator that was moving strange and
horrible and unearthly it seemed my last
memory had been of kwan tao and liu
mei falling side by side in the room of
the yellow smoke forgetting all about me

  and here i was in a moving elevator
my hand was on the control the cage
was dropping

  save that liu mei was not here i
might just have entered it with her but
what hell there had been between

  my dazed drugged wits began to come
back i noted the passing floors i was
dropping from the third to the second i
jammed the control to stop the car at the
ground floor i ran out i was crazy i
suppose but it couldnt end like this i
had to find kwan tao and liu mei

  i screamed i went racing through the
corridor down the stairs heading for the
tunnel where miu lei kwan tao and i
had suffered

  i smashed headon against a wall where
the door leading down had been

  there was nothing just a smooth
wall with no sign that a stairway had
ever existed here i banged against that
panel shouting i couldnt have broken
it down with a battering ram the echoes
of my cries and my pounding ran eerily
all through the house

  that was all no other sounds

  wild with terror i raced back to the
elevator

  half an hour later i had scoured that
building from top to bottom and had
found not one living soul nor a dead
body and this at the last was the result
of my madness

  i had found no trace of liu mei or
kwan tao no hint that liu meis uncle
a bride for death



had ever even lived here every trace of
the things which had happened here had
vanished

  i found nothing i satisfied myself that
i was alone in this place that had become
a mausoleum of dreadful mystery i bat-
tered against that mystery and could find
no answer i tried to find ways down into
the warrens and only cold blank panels
met my every attempt

  i was beaten whipped

  id get officers i dashed to the outer
door the only one in this place that wasnt
locked i raced out looking along the
street for police

  the door clicked shut and locked be-
hind me

  i couldnt get back in i banged against
that door until i broke my knuckles i
cried out liu meis name and kwan
taos

  i sobbed with futile rage and despair

  this was i knew the end

  nobody hi all chinatown throughout

which my cries and battering must have
been plainly heard gave the slightest sign
until almost an hotir of madness had
passed

  then an old a very old chinese gen-
tleman came to me looked up and said

  it is futile for the foreigner to batter
his head against the stones the dead
must bury their dead the past is gone
nothing can be regained the task of
the living is to forget quickly in your
place my young friend i should go back
to my own for never again will you see
any of those you knew so well-no not
even though your police tear chinatown
into shreds

  it took a long time to convince me but
he did it finally and i went home stag-
gering like a drunken man while fingers
of yellow mist seemed eternally to be
striking the lobes of my brain pushing
them against the inside of my skull

  out of it all i thought crazily the yel-
low smoke at least would be always with
me

the black chapel

   joe seitz had risen from puddler to the control cab of the big ladle in less
   than three years a hard worker joe seitz was and the hearth foreman had
   had his eye on him from the first before the first year was out he had seen
   that joe was put in charge of furnace no  and the only reason joe hadnt risen
   steadily from that time onward was due to no fault of joes it just happened
   that at the time there was no job open to promote joe into

  there was a pause in the puddler bosss
upward progress that lasted almost two
years that two years strained joe seitzs
patience to the limit-and beyond

  but seitz had never worked anywhere
but in the steel mills he didnt know
anything else he had to stick-but there
was nothing to keep him from advancing
up and away from the furnaces nothing
that is except the fact that ben grady
had the job he was in line for-and in
two years time ben never gave a sign of
slipping never made a mistake never
missed a days work it was maddening

  joe seitz went on a three weeks drunk
to see if he couldnt think of something
to do about it his brain was sluggish
and dull when he was sober only his
motor-sensory system worked efficiently
seemingly without the stimulant of alco-
hol but liquor loosened his imagination
gave him ideas he emerged from the
drunk with a fully-hatched scheme for
removing ben grady from his path

  once in a while the big ladle got stuck
right in the middle of the mill it always
happened when there was a full load in
it-the weight of the molten metal in the
huge cauldron making the accident more


likely to occur there was a slight dent
on the girder the conveyor traveled on
and the bump sometimes sprung a dog in
the cut-off mechanism so that the circuit
to the motor was broken when that hap-
pened the man in the control cab had to
walk out on the girder until he was di-
rectly over the huge vat of boiling metal
in order to re-set the cut-off dog

  the mill did not have a night shift
business was dull and seitz had no diffi-
culty in avoiding the nightwatchman when
he came to put his plan into operation
the plan was very simple all seitz did
was to crawl out on the girder and grease
it thoroughly at the spot that would be
directly over the ladle the next time the
dog slipped   

  it did ben grady died horribly and
joe got his job

  ben had screamed when his foot
slipped on the grease seitz had put on
the girder he had screamed again as his
body plunged down through space into
the ladle of white-hot molten metal joe
seitz remembered those screams he was
afraid that he would remember-and at
intervals seem to hear them in all their
brain-twisting horribleness-until he died

  lately it had been getting woes ev-
ery time the iadle passed the middle of
the mill opposite the point where the cafe
was located joe seitz shuddered he
coidd iook down into the big vajt from
where he perched and in fancy he saw
his own body plunging into that lash-
ing fury of steei soup he tried to teh
himself that it was a merciful death

that didnt help any

grady scream the ladle didnt
any more bens death had
the repair of that dent in me
something like that usually had to
in the noill before a piece of 

was fixed but joe t

scream-the screams got 

  btnauy it got to the point where joe
decided he couldnt stand it any more
this job that he had waited three yers
for that he had worked himself blue in
the face for-that he had even committed
murder for had turned sour on him he
realized that his nerves were breaking
undfcr the strain of waiting to hear ben
scream a half dozen times a day all his
sensory nerves-his whole brain-seemed
to be centered in his ears every time the
ladle came by with its load he would sit
there tense tfuivermg waiting for the
ladle to reach that middle point then he
would hear the screams   

  joe set a date for himself he deckled
to quit in two weeks haase two weeks
were hell-but he stuck it out then-on
the last day-he almost changed his mind
the first full ladle went by-and he heard
nothing the second started up from the
hearths and he felt nothing his nerves
remained relaxed he was as calm and
unperturbed as he ever was in his life
the second ladle reached the mid-point
and went qn by joe heard nothing it
was the same with the third

  at lunch time joe was more cheerful
than he had been in months he laughed
and joked with his fellow-workers with a
freedbm and spirit of camaraderie that
made them look at mm speculativejy they
wondered if he was drunk as ior joe
he was glad that he had not given the
foreman notice if things went all right
in the afternoon he would stay on it
looked like he had laid ben gradys ghost
at last

  the fourth and fifth ladles went by that
afternoon without incident no nerve
tension no screams that decided joe
he would stay on

  about four oclock the sixth ladle
started up from the hearths joe watched
it come with a faint smile on bis thin lips
he had licked it he had beaten his terror
of the ladle hehad silenced ben gradys
screams for all time-

  tn suddenly his body tautened ev-
ery muscle and nerve was suddenly as
rigid as a steel rod his breath caught in
the fop of his lungs and his eyes started
from their sockets the ladle had come
to an abrupt stop it had come to a stop
at the exact point where it used to get
caught when that dent was in the girder
but there was no dent there now   

  joe seitz sat in his cab and shivered
he didnt know how long he sat there
but at length a hail from below aroused
him from his reverie of terror

  tot gods sake seitz t yeued the
foreman get out there and set that dog
what in hell are you waiting far

  seitz shuddered he intended to dimb
out of his cab go down below and tell the
forettfan he had quit he crawled out of
the- cab to do it-tail he suddenly realized
that instead of heading for the ladder he
was walking out on the girder good
god what was the matter with hfrfe
his body was taking him out there on
the girder to that spot directly above the
smoking bohiflg metal-and all the lime
he was trying to make it carry him be-
low out of danger   

  then men below looking up in hushed
tenseness at seitzs body up there on the
girder saw him crawl out foot by foot
until he was over the ladle then a
strange thing happened seme said af-
tenjsatd that it looked exactly as i some
ihvfese hand had given seitss leg a sud-
den yank and as seitz fefl they claimed
tba there were two screams--together
a few swore that the other scream was
in tft voice of ben grady   

  te stories that appear in terror
taozs are sometimes based on the the-
ory that physical death is not necessarily
the etfb of a human entity for whatever
one tpay happen to believe it is hardly
cqotegtable that strange and eerie things
do octur occasionally which cannot quite
be accounted for by material explanations
