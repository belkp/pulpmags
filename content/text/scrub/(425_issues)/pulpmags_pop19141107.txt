 the conflict adventure serial from the battlefields of europe a bm bowers new bookiength novel ujed a suggestion worth acting upon at the start of life nature endows most people with a beautiful skin-fair soft and pinky-white-lovely both to touch and to look upon

and what is commonly done with this great boon
often by one neglect or another the skin is allowed to
deteriorate and lose its freshness and then to make mat-
ters worse recourse is had to cosmetics and other unnatural
aids to beauty but the truth is nothing is of any use
except what is in strict accord with natures own beauti-
fying process-the best thing of all being

pears soap

which is pure in every particle and of such dainty emol-
  lience as makes it

matchless for the complexion

natures beautifying process-for keeping the skin in a condition of

natural beauty from infancy to old age-always wrsh with pears

ask veteran car owners

    you see nobby tread owners on city streets and country roads all the time anywhere and everywhere

         -ask them why they use nobby tread tires

          -ask them why they buy the clothes they wear

          -ask them why they buy the food they eat

    the reason will be the obvious reason-the simple reason-the same reason why they buy the
best of other things viz-simply because they have learned that the best in tires like the best in
everything is always the

cheapest in the end

    automobile owners everywhere are rapidly learning to buy tires on a real business basis viz-the
basis of ultimate economy

    and remember this-investigations prove that with nobby tread tires punctures are  less
than with the average tire

    these are the reasons why nobby tread tires are today the largest selling high-grade anti-skid
tires in the world

    based upon their remarkable mileage records

nobby tread tires

are now sold under our regular warranty-perfect workmanship and material-but any adjustments
are on a basis of

 miles

thousands upon thousands of veteran motorists now use nobby tread tires on their front
and rear wheels through all seasons because they give real anti-skid protection and the
lowest cost per mile

   the untrained man leaves his comfort-
less boarding house at half past six in order to
be at the shop by seven he works hard all day
stopping only long enough for his dinner pail
lunch and all he has to show for his days labor
is a dollar and a half or two dollars all of this
goes for room and board clothes car fare etc-
lifes bare necessities-leaving him nothing with
which to provide against sickness and old age

  am

   the trained man doesnt get down to
the office until nine so he leaves his comfortable
home about half past eight he puts in seven
hours a day at congenial work taking an hour or
more for lunch and makes more money each
week than the other fellow earns in a month
after ms living expenses are paid he has enough
left to enjoy some of the good things of life and
still lay by a little something for a rainy day

   the difference between these two men is -training both have brains and good health but
one has the advantage of training that fits him to fill a responsible job at a big salary hes
no more capable or trustworthy than the other man but hes trained himself to work with his brain
instead of his hands

the spook hills mystery

by b m bower

author of good indianfortunes football etc

       no writer of cowboy stories can equal b m bower ever since
   chip of immortal memory bower has been easily first among the writers
   who stage their dramas in the wide spaces of the cattle country there is
   something new about this novel it has to do with the cowpuncher but
   also it holds a mystery one of those intangible eerie things that savor of
   ghostly visitations the mountains held the secret and holding it they
   were rechristened the spook hills it took a stranger in the west to
   fathom the mystery a fine story

a complete novel

chapter i

since every story must begin some-
where suppose we start with the
muggy evening when shelton c

      sherman arrived at the sunbeam
convoyed thither in a somewhat wilted
and deprecatory condition by one called
spooky shelton c sherman was
handicapped by his name over which
unaccustomed tongues tripped most irri-
tatingly and by his complete ignorance
of things western and by a certain
frail prettiness and by a trusting dis-
position which he was soon to lose
but he was wise with a wisdom learned
in school fights and he did what he
could toward getting a fair running
start when he landed he said his name
was sherman and let the rest go for
the present he was amiable along

o

with his prettiness and he listened with
avidity to spookys rambling tales of
that wonderland to which anxious kins-
folk had sent him

  this as a beginning may sound a
bit hackneyed since the first story
was told of the west innocent young
males have arrived in first chapters and
have been lied to by seasoned old rep-
robates of the range and have attained
sophistication by devious paths not al-
ways unmarked with violence  but
when you stop to consider life itself
is a bit hackneyed

  never mind then how many trustful
youths had looked wide-eyed upon the
sage before ever shelton c sherman
stared solemn-eyed up into the face of
his mother this was his turn and
this is his story partly and it was


the pocpulflcr magazine

spookys pleasing privilege to tell him
a good deal that was true and more
that was not-about the sunbeam out-
fit and the sagebrush country that
wrapped it close

  yuh dont want to let burney put
you on the fence first thing spooky
coached when they were within five
miles of the ranch burneys all right
you bet oncet you git to know him right
well there aint a straighter whiter
man in idaho than what aleck burney
is you take it from me

  well whats queer about him
does he really try to put people on the
fence and if so why you see how
green the fellow was i dont quite
get the point

  oh i meant throw a scare into yuh
spooky explained with some patience
because the very frankness of shel-
tons ignorance disarmed him spooky
was not such a bad sort he scares
kids until they git used to him but
if you go at him right hell be all
right

  do i have to go at him shelton
laid hand upon his thigh and stretched
a long lean leg over the broken dash-
board to relieve a cramped muscle
spooky reserved his pitying reply while
he took a more careful inventory of his
passenger

  say youre all there when it comes
to measuring lengthways aint yuh 
he observed about how high do you
stack up alongside a hole in the ground
anyway over six feet aint yuh
two inches over shelton admitted
reluctantly the folks sent me out
here to get some width to go with my
length dads an architect he said
hed have to use me for a straight edge
if something wasnt done pretty soon
unh-hunh well shes shore a
great country-i reckon maybe youll
widen out some if you stay long enough
whats your age

  twenty-one with more reluctance
time will help that of course if it

will also put some meat on my bones
and take off this pretty-pretty com-
plexion ill be willing to stay ten years
spooky touched up the off horse
which was inclined to soldier on the
up-grade pull through a stretch of sand
oh youll make out all right he said
finally in a tone of encouragement
once you git out after stock-can you
ridq any

  you mean on a horse

  i mean-on a horse yes spooky
sighed in sheer sympathy with such ab-
solute benightment

  i never was on one except once
i fell off that time shelton confessed
cheerfully if it was a bike-but this
doesnt look like much of a wheel coun-
try too rough

  spooky made no reply whatever he
drove on for some minutes in deep
thought his eyes upon the trail ahead

  you were going to say something
when i get out after stock prompted
shelton c sherman after a silence

  i changed my mind in order to git
tanned and looking more humanlike i
guess yuh better set on the sunny side
of the corral a couple er three hours
a day-till your nose peels

  id rather sit on a horse if its all
the same to you shelton objected i
could learn to ride dont you think
oh i guess-maybe you could
spooky spoke guardedly youre purty
old to start in but-maybe you could
learn

  gee i was afraid id be too young
for all the things i wanted to learn
its a relief to hear im too old for
something whats that line of hills
called over there

  them us sunbeamers call them

the spook hills thats where-

spooky stopped spat over the wheel
into the sand and neglected to finish
the sentence he stared morosely at
the jagged black sky line and touched
up old blinker again more viciously
than was needful
the spook hills mystery



  why are they called spook hills
are there spooks shelton c sher-
man was gifted-or afflicted as you
choose to consider it-with the frank
curiosity of a child

   spooky meditated upon the advisa-
bility of answering the young man
truthfully after a space of silence he
said seriously there is leastways
theys one theyre calted that same
as im called it all over the country
they call me spooky and them the
spook hills do you believe in em

   shelton stuck both legs out over the
 dashboard gazed at the hills and
 thought a minute i never have he
 said simply but i expect i could i
 came out here into this country pre-
 pared to believe almost anything

  whereupon spooky regarded him
warily gave a snort and topped it off
with a chuckle he was not a bad
sort though he was an awful liar when
the mod seized him and he could lnd
a pair of credulous ears again he
spat over the wheel pointed with his
whip toward a certain low ridge blocked
at either end by high buttes and by
devious conversational bypaths he pro-
ceeded to tell a very creditable ghost
story

  gee was sheltons tribute and
turned to stare with a new interest at
the jagged peaks and gloomy hollows
i wonder if i could get a sight of it
some time you say it sank into the
ground with a low pitiful moan 

   spooky squinted at him sidewise it
 went into the ground yes i never said
 it done any moaning the danged
 thing hollered so my back hair never
 settled for four days he went at
 blinker with the whip set him into a
 gallop and then sawed the horses into
 a heavy-footed trot again maybe you
 got your doubts about it being true
 he challenged lemme tell you some-
 thing young feller you aint the first
 to doubt it spider he didnt believe
 it either when i told about it at the

ranch fn about two months back
spider he was prognosticating around
over there trailin a mountain lion and
he heard it and he was so danged
scart he dropped his rifle and come
foggin home without it thats a fact
you can ask any of the sunbeam boys
you ask spider what he seen over in
spook hills thats all-you ask him
i will shelton promised obligingly
i wonder if it would scare me if i
saw it

  hunh grunted spooky dont
yuh know

  no averred the newcomer you
see ive never been scared i was in
a train wreck once-when two elevated
trains smashed together-and that
didnt scare me and i was in a theater
panic and i stood upon a seat and
watched the people fighting like wild
cats to get to the door and that didnt
scare me and ive been held up and
robbed and upset in a canoe before
id learned to swim very well and
i was hazed good and plenty at school
of course-but ive never been scared
not scared like some fellows get you

know i was wondering-

  spooky twisted his body around in
the seat and looked shelton c sher-
man over carefully shelton took in
his legs gave two perfectly uncon-
scious pulls at his trousers-after the
manner of a man who hates baggy
knees-and returned the stare with
clear-eyed candor

  i was wondering if that spook thing
could scare me he finished deprecat-
ingly

  i-blinker ill cut the everlastin
hide offen you if you dont straighten
out them trace chains

  was it the looks of it or do you
think it was the noise that scared you 
spooky shifted uncomfortably on the
seat i dunno ill take you over
there some day and let yuh find out
for yourself

 oh would you thanks the


the cpopular magazine

tone of him was so absolutely honest
that spooky withdrew into his shell of
taciturnity and gave over his half-
formed plan of mental bedevilment
and drove on in silence save when com-
mon decency wrung from him a yes or
a no or his one safe bet i dunno

  he took the young man to the house
and left him standing there in the heavy
dusk with his baggage stacked beside
him and bewilderment in his eyes the
sunbeam like many another ranch did
not run to artistic housing and it is
very probable that the young man ex-
perienced a keen sensation of disap-
pointment when he stood before the
low dirt-roofed cabin that sprawled
upon a sun-baked area of sand and re-
alized that this was the official head-
quarters of the sunbeam ranch

  spooky lifted up his head and yelled
a summons and a door opened to let
out a huge figure that loomed monster-
like in the dvisk spooky went to the
head of blinker and stood there fum-
bling with the harness-which was his
way of masking the curious stare he
fixed upon shelton c sherman

  the gigantic figure came closer and
closer until he towered above his vis-
itor towereft though shelton owned to
six feet two spooky grinned in an-
ticipation and moved closer in the pre-
tense of looping up blinkers line

  shelton c gave one surprised look
and went forward smiling

  are you mr burney im shelt
sherman i think you expected me-
unless mothers letter went astray some-
where

  the giant took the hand of shelton
c sherman and crushed the bones in
an excruciating grip spooky watched
the face of shelton c-watched and
saw him smile wryly and heard him
make the amazing statement that he
was pleased to meet mr burney un-
der his breath spooky named the place
where little boys who steal watermelons

must go when they die and led the
team away tolthe stable

  he met spider on the way and he
stopped long enough to announce that
he had brought a pilgrim home with
him hes a purty-purty and he aint
never been scairt in his life and he
aint never been on a hoss in his life
but once and he laid his trustin little
hand in burneys and said he was happy
to meet him you know how burney
shakes hands

  huh said spider picturing men-
tally the incident  s he going to
stay 

  i dunno he thitiks he is spooky
was stripping the harness off the horses
hes got a banjo he aint so worse
-but he sure is tender

  hell get over it spider stated
wisely if he stays long enough
yeah-if  wonder what burney
wanted him out here fur looks like
hes got his hands full enough without
takin no kid to raise

chapter ii

  in that part of idaho which lies
south of the snake the land is spotted
with forest sage flats lava beds and
grassland you can find anything there
-anything in the shape of wild deso-
lation in the days when the sunbeam
held by right of possession the range
which lay east and south of spook
hills you could find more of the deso-
lation more of the forbidding wilder-
ness than the land holds now the
sunbeam ranch-which means that bit
of fertile land where stood the sun-
beam buildings-was tucked away in a
coulee so hidden that one might ride
to the very rim of it before suspecting
its nearness

  idaho is full of such coulees you
ride through miles and miles of bleak
desert with nothing to break the mo-
notony save a distant pile of rock-
crowned hills you enter a nest of
the spook hills mystery



thick-strewn bowlders perhaps and
turn and twist this way and that to
avoid the biggest of them then you
find yourself on the brink of a steep
hill-when it is not a cliff-and just
below is a green little valley with trees
or a gray little valley with sagebrush
crowding upon the narrow strip of grass
which borders the stream or a black
hole of a valley that looks like the
mouth of hell itself with gleaming
ledges of lava interspersed with sharp-
cornered rocks the size of your head
and stunted sage and greasewood and
no water anywheres if you go down
there you will hear the buzz of a rat-
tler before you find your way out and
you will see horned toads scuttling out
of sight in little crevices and lizards
darting over bowlders into hiding be-
yond you will see the bluest sky in
the whole world-or perhaps it only
seems so when it bends above so much
that is black and utterly desolate

  it was in a gray little valley that the
sunbeam cabins stood farther along
there was a meadow to be sure where
hay was cut for the saddle horses to
feed upon in winter but that was
around a black elbow of lava that thrust
out toward the stream like the crook
of a witchs arm hiding jealously the
green little nook she had found for her-
self the cabins were built upon bar-
ren sahd-perhaps because the green
places were too precious to be used im-
providently for mere comfort in living

  the cabin was low and gloomy for
want of windows burney bent his
head level with his chest every time he
entered or left his own door and never
thought of building a house to match
the immensity of his frame burney
was six feet and eleven inches tall when
he stood barefooted his cabin was a
little more than seven feet to the ceil-
ing inside so burney desert bred
though he was never wore his hat in
the house bareheaded he did not scrape
the ceiling when he walked about un-

less lie went close to the wall when
he did that he ducked unconsciously

  shelton c sherman spent the whole
of the first evening in watching burney
with something of the incredulity which
marks the gaze of a small country boy
when confronted unexpectedly by an
elephant when burney rose from his
chair-it was made of planks spiked
together so that it formed a square
stool that would have borne the weight
of a horse-shelton glanced involun-
tarily upward to see howr close he came
to the roof when burney turned his
back shelton c measured mentally the
breadth of his shoulders and fought
with his disbelief at the figures his mind
named for him when burney sat
down before the fire shelton stared at
the huge boots thrust forward to the
heat half expecting that burney would
presently call out wife bring me
my hen if you have never heard
the story of jack the giant killer you
will not see any sense in that when
burney filled his pipe shelton wondered
how he managed to avoid crushing the
bowl of it in his fingers shelton c
sherman caressed the swollen knuckles
of his right hand and stared astonished
at the light touch of burney when he
picked a coal from the fire and dropped
it neatly into the center of the pipe
bowl

  there were two things small about
burney they were his eyes which
in the firelight looked like little twin-
kling blue sparks and his voice which
when he spoke was high and thin and
almost womanish only he seldom
spoke

  at the bunk house the boys discussed
the newcomer and wondered how he
felt shut up alone with burney
spookys curiosity led him as far as
the window of the cabin he peeked
in with spider looking over his shoul-
der the scene within was disappoint-
ing in its tranquillity shelton c sher-
man was sitting on an upturned nail


the cpopulacr magazine

keg smoking a pipe and staring med-
itatively into the fire three feet away
burney sat upon his plank stool with
his great made-to-order riding boots
thrust away out toward the blaze also
smoking his pipe and staring medita-
tively into the fire

  spider craned for a good look at the
pilgrim saw him lift his right hand
after a quiet moment and run finger
tips gingerly over his knuckles he
glanced afterward inquiringly toward
burney and spider snickered and
nudged spooky in the ribs

  looka that he whispered bet
he carries that paw in a sling to-morra
unh-hunh-but he stood for it like
a little major and said he was pleased
to meet him spooky testified also in
a whisper

  huh murmured spider and led
the way back to the bunk house

  breed jim was there having jusf put
up his horse after a late ride from over
toward pillar butte that in itself was
not far enough away from the com-
monplace to be interesting but the
look on breed jims face as he glanced
up at the two caught their attention and
drew their speech away from the vis-
itor

  say jim began without prelude
of any sore where was it you seen
that there ghost of yourn spooky
ghost uh mine i aint paying taxes
on no ghost spooky denied indig-
nantly what you driving at any-
how  come in at this time-a night and

begin on me about-

  oh i aint beginning on nobody
jim pried off the corner of a fresh
plug of tobacco and spoke around the
lump i seen something out on the
aidge of the lava bed follered me for
about a mile i couldnt ride away from
it and i couldnt git within shootin
distance s too dark to make out what
the thing was-but it was  something
scared m horse so i couldnt hold him
hardly

  whereabouts on the lava bed
spider wanted to know up next the
hills thats where i seen something
last winter

  it wasnt there-i was away over
on the fur side-a that black coulee
you know the one i mean-the one that
heads up into the big butte i hit the
coulee just about dusk-she got dark
quick to-night-and i was driftin along
to-ward the injun trail to come across
and on home when i first felt the thing
a follering

 felt-

  yeah-i felt it something told me
i was bein follered and i looked back
first i didnt see nothing i was cornin
along through the rocks and i couldnt
a seen a hull army of soldiers i went
on a little piece further and looked
back again and i never seen nothing
that time neither but there was some-
thing-i could feel my back crawl cold
moren that m horse got to actin on-
easylike and lookin back it went
along like that till i come to the injun
trail-and then i seen something back
a piece behind me jest duckin behind
a big rock

  do ghosts ever duck shelton
was standing by the half-open door lis-
tening fascinatedly now that he had
spoken he entered the room his hat
in his hand pardon me for listening
i didnt mean to but i arrived just
at the point where your back crawled
cold that sounded interesting so i
waited for the rest of it sherman is
my name fellows im just as green
as they make them in stories possibly
a shade greener but mr burney sent
me down here to sleep so ive just
about got to force myself on you and
crawl into some corner where i wont
be too awfully conspicuous he
grinned down at jim with that cheer-
ful candor which had disarmed spooky
wont you please go on with your
story he begged i didnt mean to
the spook hills mystery



interrupt honest but i was so inter-
ested i forgot my manners

  hunh grunted jim from behind
the mask of stolidity which he wore
before strangers and comforted him-
self with more tobacco he made no
attempt to go on with his story how-
ever

  this is only the young feller i brung
out from town spooky explained
burneys took him to raise name of
shep-or something like that you
dont want to mind him jim go on
and tell us

  what did it look like a man
spider sat down on the end of a bunk
and leaned forward interestedly

  jim shook his head with a quick
glance at shelton from under his black
eyebrows i dno what it was like
didnt yuh see it agin

  nh-hn jim rose and went to the
door and looked out mumbled some-
thing about his horse and disappeared

  oh say im afraid i spoiled the
whole story shelton protested re-
morsefully i didnt mean to do that
what was it all about anyway did
he really see something

  i dunno spooky answered him
tonelessly you can sleep in that bed
over there shep nobody lays any
claim to it the feller that owned it
blowed his brains out right in that there
bed last fall

  oh itll do all right for to-night
shelton c assured him amiably im
tired enough to sleep any old place
dont bother about me-ill be all
right

  we aint bothering about you
shep smiled spooky deceitfully not
a-tall we aint bothering

  he watched covertly while shelton
c having brought in his suit cases
robed himself in a nightshirt and went
to bed he sent a meaning glance to-
ward spider because of the nightshirt
which to spooky seemed absolutely

ridiculous and after that he lifted
his eyebrows inquiringly toward spider
when shelton c turned back the blan-
kets and with a long sigh of animal com-
fort stretched himself out in the bed
where a man had blowed his brains out
spooky was suspicious of shelton cs
seeming indifference to the gruesome
history of that bed he picked up a
deck of cards shuffled them absently
and made a spread for that game of
solitaire which he called mex

  you dont want to git to dreaming
about pore old mike he warned shel-
ton by way of reopening the subject
the only feller that tried to sleep
there after it happened woke us all up
screaming and fightin the air he wa
foaming at the mouth something fierce
when we got the lamp lit took four
of us to hold m down i dunno what
got aholt of im but next day he blowed
his brains out he glanced at spider
for the grin of approval he felt he had
earned

  shblton c yawned widely and in-
voluntarily and turned over on his
back say you fellows out here must
have all kinds of brains to waste he
observed sleepily and yawned again
this cabin must have a very brainy
atmosphere  maybe-ill-catch some if
i sleep- he trailed off into mum-
bling presently he opened his eyes
with a start and looked toward spooky
good night fellows he muttered
hit me a punch if i-bother you with
-sn-snoring then he went to sleep
in earnest and breathed long and deep

  spooky played in silence until the
game was hopelessly blocked he
dropped the remainder of the deck ypon
the table got up took the lamp and
went over and held the light close to
the sleep-locked eyes of shelton c
sherman he waved the lamp back and
forth twice saw the sleeper move rest-
lessly away from the glare without wak-
ing and stood up and looked at spider

  im a son of a gun  he stated flatly

vvhadda yuh know about a kid like

that

  breed jim went into the cabin where
burney still bulked before the dying
embers his pipe held loosely in his
great fingers his little blue eyes fixed
abstractedly upon the filming coals
jim went over and leaned an elbow on
the rough mantel and stared down re-
flectively into the fire the indian in
him being strong enough to induce a
certain deliberateness in beginning what
he had come to say

  there was no indian blood in bur-
ney  yet he sat perhaps five minutes
before he stirred at last he shifted
his feet gave a great sigh as if he
were dismissing thoughts that were
somber and looked up

  well what did you find out jim
theyre back all right jim said
without moving his gaze from the fire
been back a month or so theyre
runnin three big bands-mostly eyes
lambins on full blast they aint
worked over this side pillar butte jet
but theyre workin this way all right
feed aint so good over there and they
got to cover lots of ground theyll
be crowdin up on us purty soon

  talk with any of em

  nh-hn i kept back on the ridges
and sized things up dont think any
of the bunch spotted me i didnt know
what yuh might want to do about em
so i left the game plumb open

  burney got up and stretched his arms
out full length from his body-and he
had a most amazing reach for any hu-
man outside a circus they neednt
think ill buy em out again he re-
marked half to himself

  jim grinned approvingly they
made good money oflfn you last time
he twitted tactlessly you cant blame-
em for bringing in another outfit to un-
load on yuh i guess they made more
on the deal thi what you done
burney turned and scowled down at

him and jim pulled the grin from his
lips and backed a step sometimes bur-
ney would stand for joshing jim re-
membered and sometimes he wouldnt
and when he wouldnt silence was a
mans best friend

  he waited a minute or so longer de-
cided that burney was not going to say
any more-or that if he did what he
said would not be pleasant to hear and
went out without a word of explana-
tion or adieu

  burney walked twice the length of
the cabin hesitated and then busied
himself in his little storeroom and came
out with a bundle under his arm he
went outside stood upon the doorstep
and stared hard at the bunk house
when he saw the lighted square of the
window wink dark and open its eye
no more he moved away toward the
stable and for all his bulk he moved
swiftly and quietly in the corral a
big brown horse nickered and came
forward expectantly burney reached
out a hamlike paw and the horse nuz-
zled it like a pet dog he went over
to where his saddle a huge heavy thing
made especially for him hung by one
stirrup from the end of a top rail and
the horse followed at his shoulder he
did not speak once to the animal while
he put on the saddle and the bridle
but every touch was the touch of af-
fection

  presently he rode quietly away
through the sagebrush across the little
flat and up the steep hill to the east
in the starlight he looked like the mag-
nified shadow of a horseman moving
slowly up toward the stars frequently
he stopped to breathe his mount for
the hill was steep and though the horse
was big like his master and heavy-boned
and well-muscled bnrney was a load
for him at the top burney turned and
rode forward on the trail which breed
jim had lately followed and went for-
ward at a slow easy trot that slid the
miles behind him with the least efifort
the spook hills mystery



  at the sunbeam the men slept heav-
ily in the stuffy darkness of the bunk
house but burney their boss rode
and rode through the sage and the lava
and crossed steep gullies and skirted
ledges that no four-footed thing could
scale-unless we except the lizards that
lived there-and still lie went on the
great dipper tilted more and more and
the wind rose and blew chill across the
uplands a thin rind of moon rose and
slid behind a flock of woolly clouds
that reminded burney disagreeably of
sheep and after a while the wind grew
tired and blew long sighing gusts and
then forgot to blow at all and still
burney was in the saddle riding alore
with no trail to guide him and yet not
aimlessly

  when daylight was close behind the
deeper gloom of the fading stars he
rode slowly down the hill and back
across the little barren flat and stopped
at the corral gate

  in the dark he hunted for an old
gunny sack in the grain shed and when
he had found one he unsaddled his
horse and with the sack he rubbed and
rubbed until he felt certain that the
animal betrayed no sign of having been
ridden that night then he hung sad-
dle and bridle back upon the rail end
closed the gate and went up to the
cabin and got into bed

  in the bunk house spider and jim
and spooky w ere sleeping still with an
occasional snort or a mumble of half-
formed words to show that spooky was
dreaming again shelton c sherman
snored rhythmically on the bed of hor-
rible history  and then the window
brightened with the first flush of dawn
-and the sunbeam ranch faced the
beginning of a new- era of its little
personal history

chapter iii

  it took shelton c sherman a week
or so to get used to sunbeam ways
and to burney and to the blunt josh-

ing of the cow-punchers who called
burney their boss he learned to ac-
cept their sudden disappearances and
their unexplained absences and their
unexpected arrivals as the routine of
a cattle ranch he learned also to ac-
cept burney as a reality and gave -over
the fantastic idea that he was part of
some fairy tale projected into the sage
country he learned to answer when
some one shouted for shep-for that
was the way they twisted his self-con-
fessed nickname of shelt

  he learned that he must not believe
all that they told him however serious
might be their tones and their counte-
nances he learned to look for an eye-
lid lowered slyly and to recognize that
particular muscular contraction as a
warning signal and to doubt whatever
assertion the winker might make there-
after he learned a good many things
as a matter of fact and since he was
young and of a cheerful temperament
and much given to fun he learned
faster than one might suppose in a
week he acquired a doubtful smile and
a look of inquiry in two weeks he
had forsworn all faith in his fellows
and refused to believe anything he was
told which piece of radicalism was al-
most as bad in its way as was his too-
confiding tendency

  burney drove the first nail into the
coffin of his faith and he did it the
first forenoon of sheltons sojourn at
the sunbeam he found shelton hang-
ing blankets and quilts on the sagging
barbed-wire fence that inclosed the
grave of some gardeners hopes he
stood and w-atched shelton examine a
calico-covered pillow and finally he
asked what was wrong with it

  why you see said shelton cheer-
fully the fellows seemed to think the
bedding hadnt been thoroughly cleaned
after that man committed suicide in
them so i thought it might not be
healthy to sleep in them without a good


the populjltr magazine

airing they told me it was on this
pillow he blew out his brains-

  they lied to you burney said
flatly nobody ever died on this ranch
yet

  shelton dropped the pillow and
stared at the giant oh they lied to
me he repeated disappointedly i
dont see why theyd want to do that
-do you he looked undecidedly at
the flapping blankets and began to pull
them off the fence i suppose theyd
think it a great joke if they saw all
this bedding outside he explained i
guess id better put it back on the bed
and wait for the next move it wouldnt
do to say id found out would it
he stopped and faced burney his can-
did blue eyes looking up at the big man
i wonder if they did it to scare me

  chances are said burney dispas-
sionately and went on to the cabin

  after that faith died quickly shel-
ton came to that mental attitude of gen-
eral distrust which demands absolute
proof before he would accept anything
as fact

  you can see how that would work
out in a country where everything was
strange and where ignorance must per-
force be warned of many things by ex-
perience or suffer the penalty

  what are those hills over there
called he asked burney guilefully one
day and pointed toward the east

  them burney turned his head
slowly toward the high broken ridge
standing stark -and barren against the
sky thems the piute hills over
there

  the fellows call them the spook
hills said shelton in the tone of one
who has once again suffered disillu-
sionment

  they may call em that said bur-
ney but that aint saying its their
name

  spooky says he saw a ghostover
there

  ed always seein things

   id like to ride over there if you
 dont want me for anything shelton
 was beginning to find little duties
 around the place so that he felt that
 he was not altogether his own master
 could i take old dutch and a lunch
 and do a little exploring to-day
 there aint nothing over there
 burney said with a shade too much of
 emphasis better ride over to the
 river if you want to go somewhere
 id rather go to those hills if its
 all the same to you ive heard so much

 about them-

   youd git lost burney scowled
 down at him

   oh no i wont ive got a com-
 pass and shelton produced a com-
 pass the size of a dollar watch and dan-
 gled it by its buckskin string before
 burney ought i to take water along
 or are there streams and springs he
  was smiling in anticipation of the ex-
 porers thrills until he tilted back his
 head and looked up into burneys face
 the smile gave place then to plain puz-
 zlement why dont you want me to
 go he asked straightforwardly like
 a child dont you want me to use old
 dutch you told me i could ride him
 whenever i wanted to so i took it for
 granted--

   i dont care how much you ride
 him burney was plainly ill at ease

  then why dont you want-

   oh i dont care go where you
 want to onty-there aint anything to
 see he pulled out his pipe and be-
 gan to fill it nervously

   maybe ill see spookys ghost
 laughed shelton and stopped short
 when he looked up at burney

   eds a fool they aint any such
 thing burney spilled tobacco into the
 wrinkles of his ill-fitting vest

   well i can go cant i shelton
 did not attempt to understand this big
 man he looked so different from
 other men that one would not expect
 him to act like others he reflected in
the spook hills mystery

ii

the week of their acquaintance he had
observed many peculiar traits in bur-
ney he slept sometimes for hours dur-
ing the middle of the day for one thing
and he had long fits of silence that
were almost sullen and was sometimes
querulous afterward with the men so
that they avoided him quite openly as
the simplest means of dodging trouble
shelton thought that burney was in one
of his unpleasant moods this morning

  you can do as yuh please i

reckon- and burney spoke even

that qualified consent grudgingly

  so shelton took long steps to the
stable having spied spooky there he
wanted spooky to help him get the sad-
dle and bridle on dutch-the proper
tying of a latigo being still a baffling
mystery to him also he could not for
the life of him tell which was the
front of the bridle

  he went grinning up to spooky and
clapped that individual on the shoulder
im going spook hunting he an-
nounced gleefully want to go
along

  no i dont want to go along
spooky retorted mimicking sheltons
tone spooks dont travel by daylight
shep better wait till toward night

  im going to stay till night shel-
ton told him calmly ill take a lunch
along and ive got a compass and
i can travel by the north star

  youll want to travel by lightning
if you hear that thing that i heard
spooky fleered wait till you git out
there in them lava hills and it com-
mences to git darkish honest to gol-
lies shep they is something out in them
hills  wasnt lying to yuh about that
tlieys three of us now thats saw it
and heard it it aint human and it
aint no animal it-say ill bet four
bits youll come home scairt plumb sim-
ple-if yuh come you wouldnt git me
out there after sundown-not fer this
hull outfit

  say that sounds interesting shel-

ton declared trying to put the chin
strap over old dutchs nose and won-
dering what was the matter ill have
something to write home to the folks
about whoa old boy open your
mouth like a good sport

  spooky came up and took the bridle
away from shelton with an air of weary
tolerance chances are well do the
writin home to your folks if yuh go
prognosticatin around over in them
breaks he predicted ominously yuh
better keep away from there-thats
straight goods shep he added seri-
ously on the dead it aint no place
for a man to go prowling around alone
unless he has to

  thats the kind of place little me has
been looking for im tired to death
of nice safe places that you can pet
i came out here to be real wild and
woolly and spook hills keep a calling
and its there that i would be-hunting
ghosts that scare our spooky soon as
its too dark to see he sang the
paraphrase and like the cheerful young
reprobate he was he went blandly
around to the injun side of dutch
and would have climbed into the saddle
if spooky had not grabbed him by the
coat and pulled him back

  learn to git onto a horse right why
dont yuh spooky protested dis-
gustedly dont go and insult pore old
dutch by mountin like a squaw
spooky watched him go bobbing up
the hill and out of sight over the rim
and his eyes were friendly while he
made disparaging remarks about the de-
parting one he liked shelton c sher-
man with a patronizing tolerant kind
of affection even though he did lie to
him and tease him and bully him

  shelton went joyously on his way
through pungent sage and over hot
barren spaces where was nothing alive
except the lizards spooky had been
human enough to give shelton c some
really good advice about riding alone
part of it was to let dutch use his own


the popular magazine

judgment and take his own pace in
rough country for dutch had grown
old in the sagebrush and he was wise
with the wisdom of range cayuses
therefore having headed for spook
hills he left the rest to dutch and
the god chance and rode with his mind
at ease

  barrenness he found and heat and
desolation and a certain eerie gran-
deur such as he had never dreamed the
land could compass he did not find
anything ghostly about the place how-
ever and he was disappointed at the
prospect of an uneventful day in a wil-
derness where the stage was set for
bold adventure he was hot and the
canteen he carried dried on the outside
and let the water turn sickeningly warm
he did not feel like eating the coarse
sandwiches of sour-dough bread and
cold bacon and there did not seem to
be any place where he could make
dutch comfortable while he rested in
the shade of a black ledge

  he shot a jack rabbit at forty paces
with his nice new thirty-eight revolver
and was astonished to find himself
spread-eagling into a sandy space be-
tween two thick clumps of sage it had
never occurred to shelton that dutch
might object to the sudden report of
a gun discharged behind his ears-the
rabbit had been running before them
when shelton fired

  shelton got up and dug sand out of
his collar and picked up his hat and
laughed at the joke of it after that
he led dutch to where the rabbit lay
kicking in the hot sand it cried like
a frightened baby when he drew near
and shelton almost cried himself with
the pity of it a shoulder was broken
and the heart of it thumped so hard
that its whole body vibrated with the
beating and when shelton picked it
up and stroked it as one strokes the
back of a kitten its eyes fairly popped
with fear he spent ten minutes in
bandaging the shoulder with his neck-

tie and while he worked he talked
soothingly to the terrified little animal
he did not want to leave it there in
the desert to die and he could not bear
to kill it he held it in the crook of
one arm while he mounted awkwardly
and rode on wondering if he could find
a cool shady little nook where it could
stay until its shoulder healed

  after a long while he thought he
heard some one shooting and he turned
that way not the vicious crack of a
large-calibered gun but the pop of a
twenty-two he thought it was

  presently he came out from a huddle
of great black bowlders and heard the
rifle crack just beyond the next rock
huddle he rode that way and he
came upon a girl sitting at ease upon
a flat rock that was shaded by the
ledge at her back staring across a nar-
row gulch that was a mere rocky gash
in the hill while he stared also she
lifted her- small rifle aimed carefully
with her elbow resting upon a conveni-
ent protuberance in the ledge and fired
she lowered the rifle and peered
sharply aimed and fired again shel-
ton looked but he couldnt for the life
of him see what she could be shooting
at

  dutch snorted and backed and the
girl glanced that way and saw shelton
staring curiously the wounded rabbit
held close under one arm

  hello she said and turned her at-
tention again to the gulch

  shelton got out of the saddle without
spilling the rabbit dropped the reins to
the ground as spooky had told him
he must do and came forward with his
best making-friends manner secretly
he was a bit disappointed in the girl
because she was not beautiful you
see he had read a lot of western sto-
ries and he had become infected with
the idea that all range-bred girls are
lovely--real love-story heroines wait-
ing to be discovered

  this one was not true to type-grant-
the spook hills mystery



ing that the story girls are typical her
hair was a sunburned brown and there
was nothing lustrous or sheeny about it
-the desert winds saw to that it
seemed abundant enough and all na-
tive to her own head she had it
braided and hanging down her back
with the end of the braid merging into
two wind-roughened curls there was
no ribbon bow at all by the way but a
twist or two of what looked suspiciously
like common grocery twine she wore
an old felt hat that looked as though it
had seen hard usage and a faded calico
shirt waist and skirt of brown denim
her face was sunburned with a tend-
ency toward peeling and her hands
were brown and rough for the rest
her eyes were a clear blue-gray that
changed color with her moods and the
light her mouth could not be spoiled
by a harsh climate and primitive liv-
ing so that it was nice also red and
well shaped and flexible and curving
easily into a smile

  how-de-do  what you shooting
at shelton began ingratiatingly smil-
ing down at her while the hot breeze
fanned the moist hair off his forehead

  rattlesnakes put on your hat you
want to get sunstruck  the girl
glanced briefly at him again then aimed
and fired across the gulch

  oh say are you really shooting
rattlesnakes my name is sherman
im staying at the sunbeam ranch you
dont mind if i stop a few minutes do
you its horribly lonesome in these
hills

  dont i know that the girl moved
aside to make room for him in the
shade and shelton accepted the mute
invitation and sat down beside her i
guess i know more about lonesomeness
than you do mr sherman pm tickled
to death to see somebody that dont
smell of sheep 

  shelton turned and looked at her as
long as he dared thats awfully good

of you he murmured in his week-end
tone

  no it aint its just human of me
i live right in the middle of em i
hear sheep and smell sheep and see
sheep twenty-four hours a day except
when i saddle up and get out like this
for a while-and then the emptiness is
just as bad her mouth drooped a lit-
tle i go back to the wagon at night
tickled to hear the sheep blatting and
the dogs yelping-just because theyre
something alive

  i didnt know there was a sheep
ranch so close shelton said by way
of keeping the conversation running
along smoothly though ive heard
the fellows at the sunbeam talking
about some sheep

  there isnt any ranch the girl told
him drearily i could stand that be-
cause id have a cabin of some kind
to take care of i live in a sheep wagon
with poppy and uncle jake i do the
cooking and thats all there is to do
you cant she observed dispiritedly
do much housekeeping in a sheep
wagon

  shelton had learned in the past week
to conceal his ignorance if possible so
now he merely shook his head and said
it did seem rather discouraging to try
-though he had not the faintest idea of
what a sheep wagon looked like

  theres another snake she an-
nounced suddenly and lifted her little
rifle there must be a regular den
over there ive seen six already-i got
four i think she fired and a tiny
plop of rock dust told where the bullet
had struck missed she said unin-
terestedly

  where is he ill have a whack at
him myself shelton laid down the
rabbit which was too paralyzed with
fear to move i havent practiced any
since i came to the ranch he explained
apologetically ive always heard what
fine shots the cowboys are and i didnt
want them laughing at me but-


the pocpular magazine

  but my sample of shooting encour-
ages you to go ahead finished the girl
laconically cowboys dont shoot any
better than anybody else she went on
in the tone of an iconoclast its just
the name of it theyve got why dont
you shoot  cant you see the snake on
that ledge just under where i hit
looks like a crooked stick-there now
when he quits crawling you shoot at his
head she gave a dry little laugh
you neednt be afraid to shoot before
anybody if you can take his head off
from here with that gun

  oh say shelton waited long
enough to hug himpelf farcically this
is going to be real wild-west sport
gee shooting rattlesnakes in their

dens-

  well shoot first and talk about it
afterward advised the girl bluntly
heil crawl out of sight in a minute
shelton obediently raised his revolver
high brought it down in line and fired
-while the girl watched him curiously
now that his attention was diverted
from herself thus she did not see
whether he hit the snake or not and was
startled at the whoop he gave

  say im the lucky child did you
see him wriggle stirred up the whole
family too gee look at em

  now this is not going to be a snake
story i shall not say how many rattlers
those two killed in that gulch while
they sat there in the shade and talked
and watched and fired when a snake
showed itself the point is that they
became very well acquainted before the
girl got stiffly to her feet and said she-
must go or poppy would wonder where
his supper was coming from

  shelton having learned that one
pinched the rattles off the snakes one
killed and kept them for souvenirs-
and for proof of the killing-insisted
upon climbing down into the gulch and
collecting all he could find the- girl
-who finally confessed to the name of
vida and explained that her mother had

gotten it out of the dictionary because
it was odd and the feminine of david
and because her mothers father was
named david and ought to have a
grandchild named after him anyway-
vida protested and pointed out the dan-
ger in vain shelton must have rattlers
to send to the folks at home to prove
the snake story he meant to write as
to the danger-ignorance is frequently
mistaken for courage and he went in
spite of her arguments in spite of her
commands even and by all the laws
of nature he thereby took a long step
toward winning her regard he came
back with his nose turned up at the un-
pleasantness and with a handful of rat-
tles-no i shall not say how many-
which he insisted upon dividing with
her

  he also gave her the wounded rab-
bit to keep though she assured him
pessimistically that the dogs would kill
it first chance they got and that if they
didnt it would die of the broken shoul-
der womanlike she was inconsistent
enough to carry it home with her in
spite of her pessimism just because he
gave it to her perhaps

  shelton tried to induce her to prom-
ise that she would come again to hunt
rattlesnakes on some certain day and
failed and when they had parted and
he was riding home in the early dusk
it occurred to him that he had forgotten
all about the spook it would have
been a good story to tell vida-only
they had plenty to talk about without
that he remembered then that she had
once spoken of the place as piute hills
so she couldnt have heard the spook
story he would tell her next time
sure he knew she was not the kind
of person who believes in ghosts so it
would not scare her then he sighed
she seemed to be an awfully nice girl
but it did seem a shame that she was not
pretty her plainness was the one jar-
ring note in the days pleasure and
the spook hills mystery



robbed him of the joy of romantic mus-
ings as he rode homeward

chapter iv

  spooky had been to town and had
returned with the mail a fresh supply
of tobacco and a quart bottle of a liquid
he called pain killer it had been full
when he started for the ranch and
when he arrived it had been a good
three-quarters full this condition the
other boys speedily changed so that the
bottle was presently thrown into the dis-
card empty and therefore useless

  so it transpired that by dark the sun-
beam boys were jollier than usual and
quicker to see a joke-when the joke
was on the other fellow when spooky
remembered the mail and took a bun-
dle of letters from his pocket the num-
ber of those addressed to wshelton c
sherman caught his attention spooky
had never before seen the full name
written down on paper and he studied
it curiously

  shelton she sherman he said
aloud and stood the letter up on a
shelf shelton she sherman c c
gal ding it shelton she-c sherman
say thats a peach of a name for a
man to pack around for folks to stub
their tongue on he fingered another
letter and stood it beside the first
shelton she sherman he read again

  youre boozed up spooky spider
accused coming up behind and resting
an arm heavily on spookys shoulder
ill gamble you had twto bottles when
you left town-you swine why any-
body can read that right off anybody
that aint drunk he amended

  you try it spooky challenged
bet you four bits that you cant say it
straight he stood a third letter up
and after that a fourth now read em
all-just the names-one after another
and see whos drunk he urged bet
you four bits you cant do it

  shelton-c-sherman shelton she

-c-sherman shelton she sher-
oh thunder surrendered spider
laughing ruefully come on jim you

  so jim showing two-thirds of his
teeth in a grin came up and stood beside
them studied the letters for a moment
and fell over the very first c

  bet a dollar shep cant say it him-
self he said and took a big chewnof
tobacco nobody could-sober if
spooky hadnt went and swallered that
whole bottle i could do it

  what-all yuh talkin about a lit-
tle old man with bent shoulders and a
long graying mustache came trotting up
from a far corner where he had been
reading the last boise paper by a smoky
lamp when it comes to readin they
aint a one of yuh that amounts to any-
thing yuh cant hardly read a look-
out-fer-the-cyars sign on a railroad
crossin he gummed a wad of to-
bacco and slid his spectacles farther
down toward the end of his high
pointed nose what is it yuh want
read out to yuh

  read the names on them four let-
ters pike-and read em fast invited
spider writh a wicked little twinkle m
his eyes were trying to see who
can read the fastest

writing none of yuh shelton she

  spider gave a howl and swung pike
back into his corner shelton she
sherman shells sea shells by the she-
shore he stated gravely ill bet a
dollar there aint a man in camp can
say that straight

  they all tried it they were in the
middle of hilarious attempts when shel-
ton walked in among them smiling his
disarming smile of guileless good na-
ture

  hello shelton she sherman who
shall shell she sells on the sheshore
spider greeted him joyously come
right in my boy youre wanted


the popular magazine

  thats good id hate awfully to
think i wasnt wanted shelton re-
torted supper over fellows im
hungry as a she-bear

  shelton she sherman the she-bear

shays she shall not shell sea sells-

yelled spooky rolling over on a bed
and kicking his heels into the air and
laughing so he could not go on

   say whats the matter with you fel-
lows anyway  shelton demanded
cant you take something for it say
spooky get any mail for your little
friend

  make shep say it or dont give him
his letters suggested jim spitting to-
bacco juice into the wood box so that
he could grin

  say what

  spider went over and stood guard be-
fore the shelf his face was sober ex-
cept for the lurking little devil of fun
in his eyes heres four letters from
mamma and susie and sister ann and
the little fairy that works in the candy
store on the corner he informed shel-
ton if you can say shelton she sher-
man sells sea shells on the sheshore-
say it right i mean-you can have em

  no he cant interjected spooky
rising up recovered from his fit he
cant have but one for every time he
says it-

   he cant have feut one try for every
letter put in jim coming up

  shelton took a minute to grasp just
what was expected of him he made
jim repeat the sentence and he said it
over under his breath for practice while
jim muddled the wods

  he peered at the envelopes over spi-
ders shoulder and his heart swelled
with desire

  shelton c sherman sells sea shells
on the sheshore he recited confidently
and reached out his hand for the first
letter

  sheshore-yuh cant have it you
done lost that one declared his tor-
mentor try the second one shep

  oh say fellows that ones from
the only mother ive got pleaded shel-
ton  but the three were obdurate the
second one he lost and the third the
fourth which he suspected of being a
bill from his dentist he refused to try
for and went off to get something to eat
in the cabin more than half angry be-
cause that was his first mail from home
and he had been fighting homesickness
ever since he landed shelton c sher-
man loved a joke but he considered
this performance just plain meanness

  however he practiced faithfully
upon the sentence while he ate cold
boiled beef sour-dough bread and a
dish of fried corn and emptied the tea-
pot of reddish tannin-charged tea bur-
ney sat smoking before the fire and said
nothing at all so fed and feeling more
equal to the situation he hurried back
to the bunk house

  shelton c sherman sells sea shells
by the seashore he recited trium-
phantly the moment he was inside the
door and grabbed the letter he knew
was from his mother aw i guess
you fellows are not so smart he
taunted shelton c sherman sells sea
shells by the seashore and takes num-
ber two-and thats from my best giri
fellers shelton c sherman continues
to sell sea shells by the seashore and
gathers in this tender missive from his
big sister and shelton c sherman
doesnt care a hang whether he shall
sell sea shells by the seashore at your
shervish because that other letters looks
strangely like a gentle reminder of a
very painful hour in the torture cham-
ber of one painless parks who purports
to pull cuspids bicuspids or molars
without pain to himself or money re-
funded thanks awfully my dear
friends anything else before i seat
myself to peruse these loving messages
from home

  no fair greasing your tongue
shp spooky complained you
the spook hills mystery



ought to be spanked for staying out so
late anyway where you been

  hunting spooks and shooting rat-
tlesnakes and talking to a pretty girl
dont bother me fellers

  spider fidgeted while shelton seated
himself in a chair by the lamp tilted
the chair back comfortably against the
wall and projected himself mentally
into the midst of his friends back home
spider was in the mood to tease some
one and shelton seemed the logical vic-
tim

  shooting rattlesnakes you say he
inquired banteringly by way of start-
ing something he got a grunt of as-
sent from shelton and no further no-
tice

  i used to shoot snakes some myself
spider observed reminiscently its
easy you see a snake-like it was over
there-and you pull your old gat and
cut down on him-like this-and bingi
he drew his gun and by way of illus-
tration fired between the feet of shel-
ton c sherman and splintered the
chair-round

  oh say you disturb me shel-
ton reproved mildly without looking up
from the letter

  and when you see another one-
bing this time he made a miscalcu-
lation and flicked the heel of sheltons
boot

  say look where youre shooting
why dont you how do you expect
a fellow to read--

  by jinks theres another one spi-
der shot again this time being careful
to aim at the floor under sheltons
chair

  and theres one right by your ear
shelton roused to action whipped out
his own revolver and sent a bullet him-
ming past spiders head look out
theres one right behind you

  spiders eyes widened perceptibly
and he ducked quite frankly out of
range aw i was only joshing shep
he cried reproachfully you dont
a

want to take things too serious  never
meant anything

  neither did i retorted shelton
what are you going to do now go
on playing snakes 

  nah to prove it spider broke
his gun emptied the remaining car-
tridges in his palm nd threw the re-
volver on his bed what are you fel-
lers grinning your heads off about
he demanded fretfully of spooky and
jim howd i know the kid could hit
where he aimed at stands a feller in
hand to duck and duck quick when a
strange hand points a gun at yuh no

telling-

  i didnt duck did i shelton cut
in shrewdly and i didnt know how
straight you could shoot either i took
a chance same as a fellow has to take
if he wants to have any pleasure in life
same as the girl said i took when i
went down into the snakes den to get
the rattles off the dead ones

  yes you did-not spider might
be momentarily taken aback but he was
not the one to subside permanently

  yes i did too and shelton pro-
duced several rattles with the pinched-
off place still showing fresh and
thats only half i divvied with the girl
just to show what a nice generous boy
i can be besides she shot a lot of em
herself

  what gyurl was that  pike roused
again from his reading by the disturb-
ance peered at shelton over his spec-
tacles

  oh a girl named vida she lives in
a sheep wagon over somewhere near
spook hills i dont remember her
last name she keeps house for poppy
and uncle jake-say fellows shes an

awfully nice little girl-

  pike laid down his paper took the
spectacles from his nose folded down
the bows and produced a long metal
case while he gummed his wad of to-
bacco thoughtfully which side of
spook hills is her folks rangin sheep


the popular magazine

on he asked quite as if he were a
prosecuting attorney examining a wit-
ness for the defense pike had that
portentous manner when he approached
anything pertaining to the welfare of the
sunbeam

 why i dont know-somewhere
around close i should judge because
it was after five when she said she must
go and get supper for poppy shelton
looked hungrily at his letters but he
was too polite to say that he would like
very much to be left in peace while he
read them

  pike was making ready for another
truth-compelling question when burney
opened the door and came stooping in
his little eyes fairly boring through the
haze of powder smoke that still hung
heavy in the low-ceilinged room

  spider spooky and jim looked at
one another with a trace of uneasiness
the other two met burneys sharp
glances unmoved-pike because he
eould only think of one thing at a time
and his mind happened to be occupied
now with other matters and shelton
because the emotion called fear had yet
to be born into his mental life during
the complete silence that fell upon the
group shelton tore open another letter
and unfolded the pages which crackled
sharply

  whats this shootin about bur-
neys voice might be high and thin and
wholly lacking in the timbre one would
expect from a man of his size but the
sentence cut deep like the whip of
tyranny

  oh-nothin i was just-foolin
with my gun just-to see how she
worked spider fumbled with his book
of cigarette papers and found it diffi-
cult to single out a leaf

  pike still ruminating upon the one
idea that filled his mind for the time be-
ing unconsciously relieved the pending
unpleasantness

  say burney them williams sheep
must be acrowdin up on our range

he piped suddenly the boy hyar says
he seen a gyurl that blongs to a sheep
outfit foolin around spook hills i
know ole sam williams has got a gyurl
but i didnt know she ever come out
n camped with im still shes liable
to a done it-if the boy heres tellin
the truth about it

  shes done it irrespective of my tell-
ing the truth shelton amended and
went on with his letter

  burney stood a little stooped forward
because of his hat scraping the log-and-
dirt roof and stared hard at pike and
at shelton and at the three others who
avoided meeting his sharp little eyes
he reached out a great paw and fum-
bled for the door latch

  you want to cut out this shooting
around here he said to spider in the
tone of the master speaking to his man
guns aint made to play with he
pulled open the door and stood hesi-
tating on the threshold come out
here kid i want to see yuh he com-
manded and went outside

  shelton sighed and folded up his let-
ter the one thing he missed most at
the sunbeam it seemed to him then
was neither companionship nor the crea-
ture comforts of life but privacy wak-
ing or sleeping he was never quite sure
of being left undisturbed for five min-
utes together-and that in a land where
isolation is the keynote of life he
went out wondering what burney could
possibly want him to do at this time of
night or what he could want to see him
about that could not be spoken of be-
fore the others so far as he had ob-
served the sunbeam inhabitants not
one of the lot-unless it should be
burney himself-ever had a thought he
would not share nor anything else for
that matter except his saddle horse and
riding gear

  burney was waiting for him outside
and without a word he led the way
over to the cabin where he lived and
where the men all ate together he
the spook hills mystery



went inside stooping to pass through
the doorway and shelton followed him
he hoped that whatever business it was
that burney had with him it would not
take many minutes

  the business puzzled shelton to the
extent that he almost forgot his bunch
of unread letters for burney asked
him question after question in his high
shrill voice about his trip leaning over
the smoldering coals in the rough fire-
place his great hands clasped loosely
together his forearms resting upon his
huge knees where had shelton gone
how long did he sit there talking to
the girl just what part of the piute
hills-burney never called them by the
other name-was it that he visited
which way did the girl go when she
left him did he come back the same
way he went did he see-anybody
these questions and more did burney
ask and never once looked toward the
boy

  to the last question shelton gave a
queer answer   tried to see some-
body he said and laughed a little
once i thought i heard some one com-
ing behind me and i thought dutch
heard something too but i didnt see
anything

  burney rolled his little eyes toward
him for a quick glance you want to
keep away from piute hills he said
peevishly theys-snakes and things
a mans liable to get bit

  surprised shelton looked at him it
was a poor reason to give a man he
thought there arent as many as
there was he returned amusedly the
girl and i together killed about sixteen
here are the rattles of half of them

  burney never glanced toward shel-
tons outstretched palm it aint no
place for you over there he reiter-
ated vaguely you better keep away
from them hills

 well- shelton was going to

argue the point to get some better rea-
son from burney than the one he had

given but burney turned his back and
bent farther over the coals and gave
shelton to understand by his very pos-
ture that the subject was closed so
shelton went back to the bunk house
and read his letters in what one might
call peace since the rambunctious ones
were wrangling amicably over a game
of solo and pike had gone to bed

chapter v

  of course since shelton had been
warned to stay away from spook hills
he was crazy to go again as soon as pos-
sible burney might have known that
if he had stopped to consider the matter
at all for he must surely have known
a little bit about human nature there
was another reason-the girl that also
might go without saying it is true she
was not pretty and back home or any-
where else where there were other girls
to choose from i dont suppose shel-
ton would have troubled to speak two
sentences to her under any circum-
stances but she was a girl and she
was the only one in that part of the
country and shelton really had noth-
ing much to do at the ranch and had
not learned to ride well enough to be
trusted out on the range with the men
burney was particular about not let-
ting him even attempt to ride any horse
save dutch who was at least eighteen
years old and considered absolutely safe

  well shelton went back to the hills
and while he was yet afar off he saw
the girl riding slowly down along a
brush-fringed gully he turned and
urged old dutch into  stiff-legged lope
that still did not stumble however
rough the ground-and shelton in his
ignorance had no sense at all about gal-
loping a horse over dangerous places
so he came bouncing along through the
rocks and sage and buckbrush show-
ing daylight between himself and the
saddle at every jump and clinging to
the horn with one hand and looking


the popular magazine

atrociously pleased and satisfied with
himself and plainly expectant of a
glowing welcome

   shakespeare asserted boldly that wel-
come ever smiles he was wrong this
welcome did not smile appreciably nei-
ther did the girl turn her horse one inch
from the way she was going that she
might meet him the sooner sheltons
grin drew itself in at the corners when
he was close enough to see the dead
composure of her face she certainly
did seem less impressed at his eager ap-
proach than a plain girl ought to seem

  hello shep she said uninterest-
edly when he was almost alongside
why this mad haste the scenery
aint going to run anywhere and hide
and the snakes aint either nd she
added as an afterthought i aint
shelton made wrinkles between his
eyebrows he hated to hear a girl say
aint-unless she was so pretty a fel-
low could forgive anything and vida
was even plainer than he had remem-
bered her as being

  are you wishing the scenery would
run away and hide he asked uncon-
sciously adopting the tone he had al-
ways employed toward a pretty girl

  i dont care what it does i wish i
could hide her face settled again
into a sullen discontent with life such
as comes sometimes to the lonely

  well the hiding looks good around
here shelton suggested amiably by
the way how is our rabbit

   it died she said indifferently i
told you it would i packed it all the
way home and got all over fleas from
the dirty thing and it went and died
before supper was ready i gave it to
the dogs

  again shelton wrinkled his eyebrows
and wished that she were different she
had no fine sentiments whatever judg-
ing from her attitude toward the rabbit
-after he had bandaged it and carried
it in his arms and had given it to her as

a special favor any other girl would
have-

  that great overgrown goliath of
yours is going to play hob aint he
she demanded abruptly looking at shel-
ton resentfully he felt that here was
the key to her ill humor and braced
himself mentally to meet her latent an-
tagonism hes a peach the great
big bully

  why how has he managed to win
your disfavor hes stayed right at
the ranch all the time-

  yes he has-not he came over to
our camp yesterday and told poppy we
were on his range and hed thank us
to get off it pretty darned sudden just
as if he owns the whole of idaho i
was in the wagon washing dishes and i
heard him he couldnt wait-he got
there before poppy had left to go carry
some grub to the other camps wed
just had our breakfast and he acted
like he owned us body and soul i
stuck my head out of the wagon and
asked him where he got his license to
come bossing us around and why didnt
he let his own business keep him busy
and he wilted right down but he
talked awful to poppy-uncle jake was
out with the sheep and didnt hear him
or there would have been something do-
ing right then and there

  why he told poppy to move right
away from piute hills and keep away
and theres better water and better
grass what there is of it in these hills
than anywhere around he wanted us
to go back toward pillar butte with our
sheep-but liell find out he aint running
the williams outfit yet

  shelton began to look uneasy as if
he were being held responsible in some
way for the arrogance of burney he
hastened to declare his absolute neu-
trality and he ended by apologizing for
burney you know he doesnt seem
to me to be unjust or dishonorable or
anything of that sort he went on i
think there must be some mistake per-
the spook hills mystery



haps he felt that you were encroach-
ing-

  he felt that he wanted to hog the
range vida interrupted hotly but
he aint going to make that work not
with us weve got just as much right
here as he has and we aint afraid of
him just because hes big as all out-
doors goliath thats what i call him
-and coming around trying to fight
with the jawbone of an ass too hes
a coward i aint afraid of him-id
stand up to forty more just as big as
he is

  shelton laughed vida is the femi-
nine of david didnt you say david
and goliath-oh say thats rich i
must write that home to the folks a
girl-david at that wheres your sling-
shot

  you shut up i aint in the mood
to joke about him you can stand back-
and see how funny it is and write to
your folks about us savages fighting
among ourselves out here over a pile
of barren hills and a few spears of
grass and some old water holes  guess
itll sound funny to them but it aint
funny to us mr prettyboy it means
shoes and flour and bacon to us if you
want to know

  do you spose i dont like pretty
clothes and things  her eyes blazed
at him- from under her old felt hat that
her father had cast aside do you
think i like to live like a squaw and tie
my hair up with a grocery string and
wear- she gave an unexpected lit-
tle sob wholly feminine and disarming
im living this way so poppy can get
ahead of the game enough to afford
something better i hate it i hate the
sight of sheep and i hate old clothes
and living away out here away from
everything a girl likes but sheeps the
only thing poppy sees good money in
and this is about the only place that
aint overstocked already and that
great big whiny-voiced booby can just

leave us alone we aint hurting him
any

  poppy sold out to him two years ago
just to keep from having trouble with
him and tried to go into something else
and he lost about half his money and
just had to get back into sheep because
theyre the only thing hes sure of mak-
ing good at and he aint going to sell
out again to please anybody and hes
going to run his sheep in these hills
just as long as he wants to and you
sunbeamers have just got to stand for
it if you dont like it why you can
lump it thats all

  i do like it shelton declared pla-
catingly you mustnt say were all
against you and wanting you to leave
here because that isnt true im not
against you and i want you to stay
around here just as long as i stay
he felt rather proud of that statement
and he was disappointed because vida
was not immediately cheered by it

  youremighty small potatoes when
it comes to this range business she re-
minded him sounds nice but when
you come right down to cases what you
think and want stacks up about as high
as a hole in the ground when i say
you have got to stand for our running
sheep here i mean the outfit youre
stopping with you sunbeamers and
were going to stay weve got to or
get out of the sheep business-and
poppy aint going to do that till he gets
outa debt theres going to be good
money in sheep this year the lamb
crop was fine

  so she talked and shelton presently
became bored with the subject to him
it looked like a big enough country for
all the people there were in it and more
big enough for all the sheep and all the
cattle too

  far as he could see the country lay
wide open with never a fence nor a
house anywhere to be sure most of
it was barren country but certain
slopes showed green in the sheltered


the popular magazine

places where the sage was not too thick
and certain threadlike gulches were -lso
green with woods and farther up in
spook hills he could see that there was
timber worthy the name and there
was so much of it for one lone cattle-
man and two lone sheep owners to quar-
rel over this big feeding ground looked
foolish

  that day they did not hunt snakes
they rode to the brink of a deep fear-
some-looking canon and vida stopped
and stared long all up and down it look-
ing for caves she said she did not
seem to care enough about them how-
ever to go down and explore the rocky
walls she was held fast in the net of
circumstances and environment that
day and her mind ran upon the every-
day sordidness of her life she had
sent to pocatello by one of their herd-
ers for a pair of shoes and they didnt
fit she wondered how she was going
to manage and exchange-there being
no prospect of her getting to town her-
self for goodness knows when mean-
time she had to wear her best shoes for
every day which evidently worried her
thrifty little soul

  shelton tried to talk of his home and
the things he had seen and done but
vida kept harking back to the petty de-
tails of her own life the other day
she had listened hungrily to his patter-
ings shelton coidd not understand why
she should seem so different so utterly
commonplace to-day shelton you see
had never confronted any of the big
problems of life-particularly the big
economic problem

  they turned up the canon skirting
it to the very foot of one of the steeper
hills shelton was beginning to think
of starting home from very boredom-
only the sunbeam ranch with its sun-
baked area of sand and its little squalid
cabins and no human being on the place
unless burney wrere home spelled a
boredom more complete than this

  this hills full of caves vida in-

formed him apathetically pointing a
grimy hand to a rugged slope i used
to be aroiuid here seven or eight years
ago-before goliath had anything to do
with the sunbeam or poppy went into
sheep poppy used to be a prospector
and he prospected all through these
hills it was a claim he sold that put
him in the sheep business in the first
place one summer i come with him
-the summer after mother died i
could show you all kinds of caves and
places around here

  why dont you  shelton smiled
to make the question more especially
adapted to a girl maybe we could
land that spook the boys claim is in
these hills come on-lets do some
exploring

   i dont feel like it and wed need
 candles anyway some day we can
 bring some and pll take you through
 the biggest ones-if i can find them
 again pve got to go pretty quick
 pm baking bread to-day

   oli stay and help me hunt spooks
 pleaded shelton suddenly realizing that
 he hated to have her ride off and leave
 him honest theres a ghost spooky
 saw it and spider and so did jim it
 follows folks at dusk-but maybe we
 could rout it out in daytime if we try
 real hard-and if you turn back and try
 to run it down it gives a horrible
 screech and disappears into the bowels
 of the earth come on lets you and
 me go spook-hunting in his eager-
 ness to persuade her his tone might al-
 most have been called loverlike

   vida settled her disreputable old
hat more firmly on her head because of
the wind that had risen and looked at

v	

him unmoved what makes you act
so silly she inquired you smiled
at me then just the way one of our
herders does when he gets about half
shot he always comes around and
tries to propose when he gets about so
full and poppy has to chase him off
the last time i set old whimper on
the spook hills mystery



him she turned away to study the
bold wall of rocks opposite theres
lions in these hills-panthers maybe
youd call em-and now and then a
black bear and all kinds of lynx and
bobcats and coyotes and things but
there aint any spooks-i guess it
wouldnt take moren a bobcat to put
you sunbeamers on the run though

i spose maybe they seen a coyote and
thought it was a spook

  after that sighed shelton with
exaggerated reproach i shall have to
leave thee farewell heartless one
until we meet under more auspicious
skies

  there aint anything the matter with
this sky said vida i wish to good-
ness you would go if youve got to be
silly i dont see whats got into you
you was sensible enough the other
time the worst of it was she meant
just what she said you could not look
into her eyes and doubt that

  shelton considered himself offended
and he turned away and rode back down
the canon wall with no more adieu than
the perfunctory lifting of his hat

  ill be up here somewhere day after
to-morrow she called after him when
he had ridden fifty yards or so

  i wont he retorted and rode on
after a while he began to wonder if she
had heard him at first he wished that
he had spoken louder later on he was
sorry that he spoke so loud

  he found a place where the canon
looked crossable and rode down into it
then the opposite side that had looked
almost as if it had a crude trail zigzag-
ging up to the top showed him a ledge
at the bottom that even he knew bet-
ter than ask dutch to climb the way
down the canon wras blocked by what
must have been a waterfall in the wet
times but was now a sheer jump-off
ten feet high he did not ask dutch
to go down that either shelton was
learning a few of the limitations of
horses perforce then he went up the

canon toward the hills-though he dis-
liked that route because vida might see
him from the top and think he was
hanging around in her vicinity

  the canon widened until there was a
grassy bottom with a little creek that
kept the place green then it narrowed
abruptly with black ledges leaning for-
ward as if they wanted to see how tar
they could tilt without losing their bal-
ance it got so gloomy dark down
there at last that shelton looked at his
watch to see if it were nearly night
he was not riding now but plodding
along afoot with dutch following pa-
tiently after and the way in which
dutch negotiated the scattered rocks
and deep little washouts proved him
the best of his kind

  the canon walls drew in to hold close
a huge thicket of chokecherries serv-
ice-berry bushes and buckbrush min-
gled in one glorious tangle shelton
tried to go through it-he was the kind
of persistent idiot that would try any-
thing-and after a few attempts gave it
up and started around the ground
was soft and black and rich looking
where he skirted the thicket and some-
where near he heard water gurgling like
a newly awrakened baby talking to its
fists the sound reminded him that he
was thirsty

  he left dutch standing with dropped
reins and went forward parting the
branches before him with both-hands to
make easy passing in a minute he
came to a tiny stream evidently fed by
a hidden spring bordered with mint and
dainty little grass flowers and shaded
deep with the thicket he felt the thrill
of discovery he was sure that vida
did not know of this cold little brook
else she would surely have spoken of
it she had looked into the canon and
had not mentioned that there was water
down there probably no white man
had ever drunk from it before he
thought exultingly as he knelt down on
the vivid green margin so sharply con-


the popular magazine

trasting with the black barrenness all
around

   he leaned far over to drink and then
drew back staring at something in the
soft black soil at the very edge a huge
imprint in the ooze a track so fresh that
even shelton new to the ways of the
wild though he was could not fail to
see that it was but minutes old-per-
haps seconds even he sat back on his
heels and looked at it puzzling over
the manner of beast that could have
made it almost human it was and
huge-big as the great tracks burney
made when he walked abroad-and yet
not human

   little trampled blades of grass were
rising slowly along the edges to show
how lately the thing had passed that
way like the print of a great bare
foot it was except that the toes were
not the toeprints of a man nor was
the track shaped just like a mans foot
shelton studied it curiously even
while he stared at it the water pushed
the mud back smoothing out little de-
tails and making the whole a big long
formless depression in the ooze look-
ing at it so shelton would have called
it a mans track and let it go at that
but it was not a mans track he was
sure of that

  must have been a bear he told
himself at last and bent over again and
got his drink she said there were
bears in the hills-but say he must be
a whopper to make a track the size
of that too bad the beggar got off
without me seeing it

  he got out his gun and examined it
pretty small caliber to go hunting the
bear that made that track-but shelton
did want to kill a bear now that he
knew there was one about it would
be something to write home to the
folks and a bearskin rug that he had
killed himself-say that would be
simply great

  foolhardily he searched beyond the
brook though the tangle was thick and

exceedingly favorable to an ambush
he was not scared-he did not know
enough of the danger to be scared he
was anxious and elated and filled with
the eager expectancy of the novice he
beat about in the bushes and then came
crashing out into the open near the
northern wall of the canon and he
stood baffled and disappointed before
the emptiness

  surely the creature could not have
climbed that sheer wall-and yet shel-
ton had a hazy notion that bears did
climb trees and things he was staring
up at it and wondering what possible
route the beast could have taken-since
it did not seem to be anywhere in the
canon-when he noticed the gorgeous
purple and crimson of the sky sunset
so soon it is astonishing how the
hours slide past when one is wholly
given up to that primitive emotion the
lust of the chase

  he must start back to the ranch
though he hated the idea of leaving that
bear alive still he could not hunt a
bear in the dark and he could get lost
very easily and worry the life out of
the fellows at the sunbeam he went
back to where dutch was waiting impa-
tiently with twitching ears and uneasy
tramplings mounted awkwardly and
started back down the canon in the
narrowest places the gloom of night was
already filling the gorge almost to the
brim and dutch stepped out briskly
wherever the footing was passable

  and then a strange sensation seized
shelton c sherman he looked back
without quite knowing why he did so
the canon yawned stark and empty be-
hind him presently he turned again
and looked vaguely expectant there
was nothing then it came definitely
the feeling that he was being followed
he stopped dutch still and waited
watching the gorge behind him there
was no sign of any living thing save
himself and a belated bird that flew
chirping up to the lighter slopes
the spook hills mystery



  shelton was not frightened as the
word is commonly understood he was
puzzled and he felt an eerie prickling of
the flesh as the darkness advanced and
muffled the farther steps but mainly
he was chagrined because he could not
see to shoot-even supposing there was
something to shoot at he thought it
would make great stuff to write home
to the folks and he kept all his senses
alert for fresh incidents or adventures
on the whole he rather enjoyed the
sensations he got out of it

  once he heard a rock rattle down and
bump somewhere-and the sound was
so close behind him that he pulled his
six-shooter from its scabbard and
turned for a shot at the bear or what-
ever it was but dutch was pulling
hard on the reins and stepping along
much faster than was wise and would
not wait till the thing overtook them

  it was dutch that found the trail up
the canonside where they had come
down he toiled up through rocks and
stunted bushes stopping when he must
to get a breath or two and listening al-
ways for something behind something
that followed them still shelton could
feel the quivering of the horses flesh
beneath him aqd it dawned on him
that old dutch was scared and that he
was climbing the hill faster than he
ought to climb if he expected to have
any wind left when he reached the top
and that he supposed he really ought to
ge off and walk it was a shame when
you think of it to make good old dutch
carry a great hulk like him up that bluff
shelton dismounted then and went
ahead

  he wondered if he really felt more
comfortable in his mind when dutch
was between him and the bear-or
whatever it was to test his own feel-
ing about the matter he looped the reins
up awkwardly around the saddle horn
and let dutch take the lead for a few
rods but he kept looking back and he

soon decided that dutch really ought to
be led

  at the top he tried to persuade him-
self that his imagination was playing
tricks with him that there was nothing
behind him save the bleak dark hills
and the usual night prowlers abroad on
business that concerned him not at all
but there was dutch hurrying along
with his eyes rolled to watch the trail
behind that did not look like imagina-
tion did it

  before he had gone a quarter of a
mile shelton was clinging to the saddle
horn while the horse galloped unevenly
over the rough ground it takes a rider
with some experience to sit easily in
the saddle and ride headlong through
the sagebrush country with a jump
here a quick swerve there and a longer
stride to bridge a cut or avoid one of
those bugbears of the range gopher and
badger holes shelton had all that to
contend with and he had also the nat-
ural roughness of dutchs gait so he
hung onto the horn and bounded and
more than once was saved from falling
by his long legs that instinctively
clinched the horses belly when he
jumped sidewise

  ordinarily the mere feat of riding at
a fast gallop was enough to occupy all
of sheltons attention to-night how-
ever the weird feeling that he was being
followed persisted  increased even

  shelton before he reached the brow of
the hill beneath which winked the wel-
come lights of the sunbeam cabins
came as near to being scared as ever he
had been in his twenty years of heedless
existence he was riding with his head
over his shoulder and his eyes strained
into the darkness behind him the last
few miles for all that he had not
seen anything that need agitate him or
goad his imagination into delusions
he would have called it a whim-but
there was dutch also looking back and
traveling with an unprecedented amount
of ambition once or twice from the


the popular magazine

way dutch acted shelton felt certain
that dutch saw it-whatever it was

  then as he dipped over the brow of
the bluff and rode down the trail into
the shut-in valley already grown fa-
miliar he heaved a sudden sigh of relief
and went on at peace whatever it was
the thing was gone at least he no longer
felt its presence and dutch settled
down to his habitual shamble and went
ort to the stables as though nothing had
ever disturbed his equanimity

chapter vi

  say fellows how big is a bear that
makes a track that long shelton
measured a space with his spread palms
and waited for some one to volunteer
the information

   bout as big as a good-sized ele-
phant drawled spider after a percep-
tible pause holding a lighted match to
his cigarette

  no but really f you know i ran
across a fresh bear track that was that
long i couldnt find the bear though
it was in a deep thicket of all kinds of
trees and bushes and i hunted all
around-but i never got a glimpse of
it its strange too the track was per-
fectly fresh-just made in fact-

 how dyuh know  spooky de-
manded looking up

  why it was right in the edge of a
little stream of water and the water
hadnt washed any mud into it yet when
i first saw it and at the heel the grass
was just beginning to stand up straight
again after being mashed down i
thought that meant the track was fresh
and-

  purty good fr a kid jim observed
dryly shifting his great wad of tobacco
to the othr cheek and grinning openly

  shelton spent a few seconds in eying
jim doubtfully and then he went on
with his story and told the whole of it
even to the conviction that he had been

followed to the edge of the bluff that
bordered the sunbeam coulee

  shelton she sherman shays she shaw
a she-bear shelling sea sells on the she-
shore spider commented gravely with
the little twinkle in his eyes

  aw say fellows shelton pro-
tested-for the thing was fresh and
very vivid in his memory its a fact
all of it he went over the whole
story again adding minute details which
he had slurred with generalities in the
first telling

  spider got up threw his cigarette stub
into the fire and turned upon spooky
say spooky youre to blame for this
he accused sternly shep was a nice
innocent truthful cuss when he come
here and your dog-goned baneful in-
fluence and example has done this
he indicated shelton with his outflung
hand youve lied to him and youve
lied before him and youve lied behind
his back ever since he come we cant
blame shelton she sherman he is
more to be pitied than censured if
shelton she sherman shays he shees
she-bears shelling sea sells on the sea-
sore why its your fault and his mis-
fortune if possible we must keep
this from his folks and if theres any-
thing we can do to remedy the evil be-
fore it becomes virulent and the whole
outfit gets infectecated i for one am
ready and willing to do my part but
if it turns out fatal the blame rests
upon you spooky

  spooky laughed so did shelton for
that matter and jim and pike and
shelton protested so earnestly that he
was telling the truth that they con-
sented at last to believe that he had
seen a track which may have looked like
a bears track also the possibility that
he had been followed by something

  but that wasnt a bear spooky in-
sisted with perfect sincerity it was
that same spook i felt and seen and ill
bet money on it you want to keep
away from them hills shep ive got
the spook hills mystery



a hunch that thing is fixin to git some-
body heres four of us been follered
now there aint a one of us that
wouldnt swear to it lemme tell you
shep them hills aint safe

  you know what happened then the
very next morning shelton c sher-
man borrowed spiders big forty-five re-
volver and cartridge belt and stuffed it
with cartridges borrowed spookys
skinning knife and fastened that in the
belt put up lunch enough to last him
two meals dodged burney and burneys
coldly questioning eyes and rode back
to spook hills to hunt for the bear that
made so enormous a track that none of
the boys would believe him when he
told how big it was spider had as-
sured him that his six-gun would sure
make it unhealthy for any bear in the
country providing shep pumped enough
lead out of it and into the bear shel-
ton had also his own thirty-eight and
he had some skill in shooting-witness
the rattles he took home with him after
that first expedition

  no one worried much about sheltons
personal welfare they were not the
worrying kind for one thing and they
trusted to dutch and that providence
which is said to watch over children and
fools i dont know just how they
tagged shelton but they fitted him out
and let him go to hunt his bear and
they helped him avoid burney who so
strongly disapproved of any spook hill
trips

  first shelton rode straight to where
he might hope to meet vida he
wanted to tell her about the bear and
he thought perhaps she might like to
join in the hunt though he doubted the
efficiency of her little twenty-two he
meant to lend her his own revolver if
she wanted to come along

  he met her fair just as he was top-
ping the high ridge that would give him
a wide outlook in the direction of her
camp she urged her horse forward

and her eyes were hard and angry when
she came close

 say you sunbeamers are sure
straining yourselves to be neighborly
aint you  she demanded truculently
without replying to his gay greeting
i dont mean you yourself she added
in the cause of justice but it sure
makes me sore at the whole pesky out-
fit do you know what goliath has
done now 

  nothing but stay at the ranch and
act like a hippopotamus with the tooth-
ache shelton replied cheerfully
thats all i know of his doing

  that aint all hes done she re-
torted sharply where was he last
night for instance

  at home when i got there-and i
was late getting in smoking in front
of the fire till bedtime why 

  because he wasnt he was over
killin off about two dozen of our sheep
thats where he was it couldnt have
been anybody but him-the big bully
he twisted their necks like youd wring
the neck of a chicken uncle jake was
with that bunch down there in the foot-
hills behind that butte he heard the
dogs and went out but it was dark-
one of the dogs was killed too she
added grimly neck twisted just like
the sheep and you know whos the man
that done it you know there aint any
ordinary man could wring a sheeps
neck like they was wrung and the dog
musta been just grabbed up and
squashed i seen him this morning
and his ribs are all mashed and his neck
broke it was laddie and he wasnt
afraid uncle jake says the other dog
just crep under the wagon and whined

when he seen what it was-

  oh say doesnt that sound more as
if an animal had been around shelton
cut in eagerly you know i went
down in that canon over there after
i left you and i saw a bear track a
whopper of a track that the boys
wouldnt believe in when i told them
	the popular magazine

how big it was why it was that long
sheltorj measured the space with his
spread palms again and again he saw
frank disbelief in the eyes that looked
at him honest he added when he
saw how she doubted

  but uncle jake did see a little bit
just as he was leaving vida said posi-
tively he seen him go over a little
rise and he was big-uncle jake would
swear it was goliath a bear dont go
on its hind legs-

  it might-if it was carrying some-
thing dont you suppose it would
carry a sheep away with it ive read
about them doing those things and they
go on their hind feet at such times
shelton leaned toward her and his
cheeks were pink like a girls with ear-
nestness im positive burney was not
away from the ranch last night he
said to clinch his argument

  finally vidas conviction was shaken
a bit she let her eyes waver from his
face and she saw then how he was
armed she pointed to the sagging gun
belt and the weapon that hung at his
hip is that for the bear she asked
with her first smile

  it certainly is-and i brought mine
along for you if youll take a hand in
the hunt come on say he must be
a perfect whale of a bear illtake
you where i saw his track and maybe
we can find some trail to his den-

 vida threw back her head and
laughed musically but with the unre-
strained laughter of one used to wide
spaces oh youre the funniest thing
alive she told him afterward do
you want me to be eaten up or do vou
think youre a match for any bear
what are you driving at to ask a
lady to go bear-hunting with you and
take a chance-

  oh i beg your pardon it never
occurred to me that perhaps there might
be some risk attached to it shelton
declared so convincingly in earnest that
she went off into another fit of laugh-

ter i wouldnt want you to be hurt
and im so horribly green at this bear-
hunting that perhaps you woiddnt be
quite safe with me gee id hate to
have anything happen to you he was
just as openly sincere in that last state-
ment as he was in the first but vida did
not laugh she only looked at him
queerly i think perhaps id better go
alone he added chivalrously it cer-
tainly must be a whale of a bear

  arent you afraid yourself vida
studied him

  afraid why i never thought of
being afraid would a man be afraid
of a bear with a track that long for
the third time he measured the space

  oh get along with you and bring
me his hide then vida seemed sud-
denly to have decided that he was mak-
ing fun of her ill trail along on high
ground where i can kinda keep tab on
you i dont believe i want to sweep
out any bears den and see if hes got
sheep bones cached in it thank you
but you can if you want to

  an hour or more after that shelton
dismounted from old dutch at the little
stream that led down from the upper
canon he thought he had discovered
another bear track but he was too igno-
rant to be sure in a narrow strip of
loose sand which bordered the stream
there was a deep imprint of what looked
very much like a heel a bare heel he
thought it though a flat rock just
even with the surface of the sand had
received the rest of the foot and left
no mark to tell exactly what it was

  shelton blundered about in that im-
mediate neighborhood for a few min-
utes and then went on at the place
in the thicket where he had found the
track there was nothing save a faint
depression in the mud and since that
was his only clew to the beast he sought
he was patently discouraged he beat
back and forth through the thicket-
not knowing the habits of a bear-and
finalf-gave up hovering around the
the spook hills mystery



place where it had been once but might
never be again he went down again
to where he had left dutch and turned
to ride back whence he had come-at
least to where he had seen that mark

  a narrow gorge that he had over-
looked before thinking it a mere rift in
the piled bowlders he thought he would
investigate he was in no hurry to ride
back to the upland and report failure
to vida who would laugh at him for a
greenhorn besides he had a vague im-
pression that bears were rather fond of
rough places this was rough enough
in all conscience even when he pulled
upon the reins and clucked encourag-
ingly dutch did not want to follow him
over some of the worst places he told
himself that the sagacity and sure-foot-
edness of the range horse has been
greatly overestimated-but if you
should see the places where he coaxed
dutch to risk his poor old bones you
would feel a new respect for that sore-
tired animal

  presently the gorge widened until it
was possible to ride instead of scramble
over rocks afoot and then just as he
was coming into another grassy bot-
tom he saw before him faintly defined
it is true but unmistakable the print
of that great foot that still looked
weirdly human to his town-trained eyes

  shelton c sherman gave a sup-
pressed whoop and went forward
eagerly triumphantly even so little
did he know of the wild that he fully
expected to ride home joyously with the
hide of the biggest bear in all idaho
rolled neatly behind the cantle later
it occurred to him that he should have
measured that track so that he might
confound spooky and spider chief
doubters at the sunbeam with actual
figures-a diagram perhaps or a
sketch but he was too far up the
canon before he thought of it so he did
not turn back

  shelton went on and on-a mile he
guessed it afterward though in rough

 country such as that distance is diffi-
 cult to estimate correctly at any rate
 he eventually came out upon a crude
 amphitheater formed by the converging
 hills on one side the ascent was al-
 most sheer with loose sliale that made
 it impossible to climb even for a bear
 shelton was sure of that after he had
 tried to go up and after dutch had
 planted both front feet -stiffly before
 him and refused to attempt it even he
 turned his attention then to the left
 wall for in front of him was a cliff
 straight and smooth and high

   here on the left were overhang-
 ing ledges bordered with bushes evi-
 dently watered from some hidden
 spring shelton surveyed the prospect
 from a little distance saw deep shadow
 under one ledge -where should be sun-
 light and rode over there it was the
 first place he had seen that looked as if
  it might be the den of a bear

    it really did look like a cave of some
 sort even when he came close though
 he stood within fifty yards of the spot
 and though the sun shone hotly upon
 that side of the canon beneath that
 jagged jutting ledge was black shadow
 shelton got down dropped the reins so
 that dutch would stand and clambered
 over the loose rocks that had rolled
 down the slope during the centuries
 past

   he stopped just where the sunlight
 stopped also and stared at the wide
 mouth that yawned at him blackly he
 could look into it for a little way and
 see how rough were the walls with lit-
 tle excrescences of what he took to be
 stalactites clinging like barnacles to the
 rock the floor once it left the outer
 edge was moist sand shelton looked
 down at it and saw tracks-a good
 many of them some of them were
 long and uncannily human and yet not
 human-the tracks of the bear and
 there were tracks also of a mans boots
 -big boots that could belong to no one
 save burney of the sunbeam shel-


the popular magazine

 tons jaw dropped a little when he saw
 those and he stared and stared before
 he ever thought of going on

  finally he turned his head and looked
back blinking from gazing long upon
the blackness dutch stood where he
had been left his ears flopping lazily
in the sunlight the rest of him hidden
by the steep declivity up which his rider
had climbed in the open beyond dutch
a hawk was circling slowly with head
dropped forward watching for unwary
gophers perhaps it was all very quiet
and very reassuring-and shelton
whether he realized it or not at that 
moment needed something stolidly mat-
ter-of-fact to steady his reeling fancies

  for burney was at home he felt cer-
tain and yet these tracks looked fresh
-as fresh as the track he had seen in
the edge of the little stream and those
other tracks the huge impression of feet
not quite human they were fresh also
or so he believed being ignorant of the
fact that in moist sand that is sheltered
from the weather a track will remain
fresh looking for a long while

  he had come prepared to explore a
cave if he found one that is he had
purloined a candle end that he found in
the bunk house and he had matches
he pulled the bit of candle from his
pocket lighted it and went into the
dark like the foolhardy fellow he was
he did show a little caution i must
confess for he carried the light in his
left hand and in his right he held tight-
gripped the big forty-five six-shooter
spider had loaned him afraid no
but tingling with excitement his senses
atiptoe with enthusiasm for the adven-
ture

  he stooped a little at first and even
then his hat crown scraped upon the
rough-rock ceiling he thought that
burney if he really did come in here
must have bent almost double just a
long tunnel straight into the hill it
seemed an ancient subterranean outlet
for water or lava or something he did

not quite know what when he held
the light down he still saw the tracks
of the beast and of the man he did not
see any coming out which did not occur
to him as being significant until he had
proceeded two hundred feet or so
then he took a fresh grip on the re-
volver and went more cautiously he
was not afraid of burney-though he
knew that he had left burney at the
ranch and therefore could not imagine
him as being inside the cave but the
beast-well he thought it wise to be
ready because a bear of such size might
be a pretty nifty proposition if a man
failed to kill him with the first shot or
two

 so he went on and on once or
twice his candle failed to reach the rock
wall upon one side or the other and he
began to wonder if there might not be
branches running in other directions
that made him more cautious still
though it could not dampen his enthu-
siasm or dull his eager expectancy he
tried to keep always going where the
tracks led which became somewhat dif-
ficult since the floor varied its moist
sand covering with a shale rock that left
no mark still he kept on going

  finally the tunnel forked plainly and
unmistakably he could stand before
a wedge of sweating rock and look
down both fearsome passages and he
hesitated there flaring the light into one
tunnel and then into the other looking
eagerly for some sign of his quarry

  and then while he stood there unde-
cided the skin began to creep and
prickle at the back of his neck-where
the hair of our cave-dwelling ancestors
used to rise perhaps at the first warn-
ing of danger shelton did not quite
know what ailed him for the sensation
was absolutely new to him he glanced
around involuntarily for some hiding
place-and he did not know why
something was watching him out there
in the blackness beyond the farthest
candle gleam it was like the sense of
the spook hills mystery



being followed the night before except
that this feeling agitated him and
alarmed him without reasoning the
thing out he dodged precipitately into
the left-hand passage and ran forward
a few steps before he pulled himself
together

  he stopped then and listened his eyes
straining into the darkness out of which
he had come he heard the rapid
thump thump thump of his own heart
and he heard that muffled beating punc-
tuated by the thin sound of water drip-
ping somewhere that was all the
rest was dead impenetrable blackness
like a wall and silence that was like a
cujjfain hung before that black wall
and yet-

  shelton c sherman stood backed
against the wall and knew that he was
afraid and that his fear was a blind
unreasoning fear born perhaps of
tricky nerves rebelling against that dark
journey into the middle of a mountain
he saw the candle flaring and fading
because his hand shook so he felt his
heart beating faster and faster until
it almost choked him and yet-

  the terrible silence was split sud-
denly by a scream human it sounded
and yet not human but beastly-hor-
rible shelton dropped the candle and
clung to the rock beside him his
heart he thought stopped absolutely
his very knees buckled under him while
he stood there and then he heard
something running somewhere even
while the cave was playing horribly
with the echoes of that scream run-
ning down that other passage with long
leaps it seemed to him and the beat of
four padded feet upon the rock floor
then it must have struck the sand be-
cause the sounds became suddenly muf-
fled and scarcely distinguishable in-
deed had he not been standing in such
a horribly still place he probably would
have heard nothing

  weak shaking scared so that the
tremor reached the middle of his bones

shelton pressed his back against the
uneven wall behind him and waited
and listened and glared into the black-
ness half expecting to see some terrify-
ing thing take shape before him he
wanted light-and he was afraid to
stoop and grope for the candle afraid
to light a match and look for it afraid
to move there was a quick suffocat-
ing beat beat beat in his throat there
was a heavy pounding in his chest and
in his brain was a numbness so that he
could not think of anything very clearly
he only knew that he was scared-in
mortal agonizing terror

  shelton said afterward that it took
him at least an hour to pull himself to-
gether so that he had the nerve to find
his stub of candle and light it but
he did find it and he lighted it with
furtive glances behind him when the
blaze flamed up and drove the heavy
darkness back so that it did not seem
to be pressing the very life out of him
finally he made his way back toward
the entrance-slowly furtively with
one side of him scraping the wall so
that he could set his back against it at
the first alarm instincts he had in-
herited from the centuries behind him
took the initiative and drove shelton
toward the light of day

  he was panting when he came out
into the sunlight though he had not
run except the last few rods when he
saw the light glimmer ahead of him
he sat down where the sun shone hotly
upon the yellow soil just out from the
ledge and thanked god for the bright
light of day in a minute he remem-
bered dutch-and dutch was gone

  shelton stood up and searched the
whole canon bottom with his eyes a
horse could scarcely hide there unless
he climbed the almost perpendicular
sides so as to get behind the bowlders
that jutted out everywhere dutch
must have gone down the canon scared
by the thing that came out of the cave
the thought served to hearten shelton


the popular magazine

appreciably there was no shame in
being afraid of anything that could
scare old dutch he told himself and
there was another point it could not
have been burney then that came out
of the cave though shelton in spite of
the evidence of the fresh boot tracks
had not convinced himself that burney
was ever in that cave it was queer-
the whole thing was almighty queer he
told himself when his pulse became nor-
mal and the fear ceased to cloud his in-
tellect there were a lot of things
which he would certainly never have be-
lieved if any one had told him about
them spider for instance or spooky
he wished they were both with him
now so that he could prove a few things
which on the face of them seemed in-
credible

  it occurred to shelton that the tracks
coming out of the cave would prove
whether it was burney or the bear-if
it really was a bear which shelton was
beginning to doubt he had never heard
or read of a bear screaming like that
a panther might perhaps-but a bear
it had been a shriek-a half-human
scream that fairly melted ones bones
no after that scream he was beginning
to lose faith in the bear

  he had forgotten to blow out his
candle but when he looked at it he saw
that the wind had attended to that for
him he glanced behind him at the
wide grin of the cave mouth debated
within himself and with a hunch of his
shoulders felt in his pocket for a match

chapter vii

  shelton lit his candle shielding its
blaze from the breeze with fingers cred-
itably steady-when you think how ter-
ribly he had been scared he stood
looking down over the sunlit hollow be-
neath him his candid blue eyes clouded
with distaste for wrhat he was going to
do his enthusiasm for caves had left
him completely yet his doggedness of

purpose impelled him to go back there
was something he had seen the tracks
and he had heard it scream and after-
ward go leaping down the black tunnel
and there were burneys tracks which
seemed mysterious and there were
those sheep about which vida had told
him dead with their necks twisted in
the most unaccountable manner he
did not see any connection between this
cave and the dead sheep save the one
fact of some great beast that could have
done the twisting-perhaps at any
rate he had to see what sort of tracks
save his own had been left in the sand
with their toes pointed toward the open-
ing he neednt go in very far to dis-
cover that much

  he went in again to where the sand
was moist and smooth save where feet
had pressed into it the imprint of their
passing he saw his own tracks the
toes deep printed to prove how fast he
had run bowred down to avoid the low
roof of the tunnel he shivered a little
when he remembered poignantly the
stark terror that had driven him for-
ward at the last then there were the
tracks of those two-the beast and the
man-going back into the dark but
save his own there were no tracks com-
ing out and yet-

  shelton forced himself to make sure
forced himself to examine the sand floor
closely from wall to wall twice he
went across the tunnel holding the can-
dle close to earth so interested in the
search that he forgot to fear what the
dark might hold even then it was a
fact there were tracks going in his
own and the tracks of burney and of
the beast and there were his own tracks
coming out with the toes pressed deep
that was all

  and yet-something must have come
out since dutch was gone for dutch
would have stood there dozing in the
sun all day with his reins dropped had
not something very much out of the or-
dinary brought his horse instincts to the
the spook hills mystery



front of his long years of range train-
ing shelton did not know that though
he did have great faith in dutchs stand-
ing where he was left until one went
and got him to be sure some one
might have ridden dutch off-but there
were no tracks

  shelton came out again and stood ir-
resolute in the sunshine of course the
first thing to do was to find dutch he
realized that and set off down the
canon-considerably relieved to be out
again in the familiar world of bright
blue sky and drifting white clouds and
the grays and browns and blacks of the
surrounding hills when he had gone
a little distance he turned and studied
the ledges of that hillside but he could
not see where the cave had any other
possible opening and so he went on
puzzling over the mystery of it what
the deuce was it that had screamed
like that what kind of an animal
could run over wet sand and leave not
a trace of passing what would bur-
ney be doing in that cave and then
who had killed those sheep vida had
told him about and the dog that had
been squashed

  he was so engrossed in trying to fit
answers to his own questions that he
wandered into a branch of the canon
that he knew nothing about going up
there had seemed to be no way except
the one he traveled going down other
gorges appeared like the knotted fin-
gers of an open hand into one of
these he blundered and thought it
strange because he found no trace of
dutch nor the opening into the larger
canon nor any rock or turn that looked
familiar

  he went a long way before it even
occurred to him that this might be a
different gorge and even when he sus-
pected that he was not alarmed he
had his compass you see the sun-
beam ranch lay to the west of spook
hills therefore the mere matter of get-
ting home was perfectly simple-to an

csa

optimistic young fellow who knew noth-
ing much about traveling in such a junk
heap of natures left-overs from moun-
tain building

  he must have traveled for an hour
and more without getting anywhere he
was beginning to wonder where he
would be apt to strike that first canon
and overtake dutch when he saw some-
thing on a rock before him a heap of
old clothes it looked like to him and he
was struck by the oddity of it he
went on more cautiously but very curi-
ously where were clothes there
should be people also

  he was quite close when the heap
moved and a head muffled in many
grimy folds of some red stuff swung
round to him shelton was astonished
to find the thing alive he was more
astonished when he discovered the heap
to be not only alive but a woman a
squaw he knew from the samples he
had seen at the railroad stations during
the last few hours of his journey west
old and seamed and shrunken to match
the hills

  shelton went up to her and stood still
she appeared to be blind for her lids
were red and gummed almost shut so
that only the tiniest slits of bleary eyes
could be seen still she stared at him
almost as if she saw him he did not
quite know how to act with a creature
like this but his natural instincts im-
pelled him to speech

  how-de-do  he began politely
do you live around here 

  she looked at him and she shook her
head no see she muttered and laid
a bony finger to her eyes long time
headache-no see shelton had read
of old crones who muttered and pointed
and spoke prophecies in halting sen-
tences like that it tickled him to have
stumbled upon one quite up to his ideas
of what they should be like for this
crone certainly looked the part and she
muttered worse than he would have be-
lieved possible to the human voice and


the popular magazine

she spoke with a perceptible pause be-
tween all the words as to her uttering
prophecies that he still had to deter-
mine

  blind he asked sympathetically
sitting down upon a near-by rock and
fanning himself with his hat he was
pretty tired and it was hot he looked
as he sat there like a young man holi-
daying in the wild who has stopped to
rest and wait for the fellows to come up
and join him blind

  see-walk-lilly bit long time
headache she said with her wizened
palm pressed to her forehead what
yo name

  shelton told her and he told her also
that he was from the sunbeam you
know the sunbeam you know mr
burneys ranch he asked her while he
stuffed tobacco into his pipe his lunch
was tied to the saddle on dutch-wher-
ever that was

 burney-aleck- she muttered

and stopped her jaws gumming words

soundlessly aleck-

yes his names aleck too-though
i didnt know any one ever called him
that you know him big man
big big man-fadder-big man
die long time i know i see aleck-

fadder die bear- she waved her

skinny hand that was like a mummys
bear kill i see long time i his
woman i see

  shelton held his pipe sagging between
his knees while he stared at her of
course he could only guess at what the
old thing really meant and she might

be crazy at that but still- you

mean youre aleck burneys mother
he asked her his incredulity showing
plainly in his voice

  she shook her head at that and mut-
tered some indian words no no-
aleck-mudder-no she denied his
woman-aleck-fadder

  whatever she meant by that it was
about all that shelton could get out of
her her mind it seemed to him was

as clouded as her vision though it might
be her indian stolidity or her indian
taciturnity or shyness or any of those
qualities which we tack upon the indian
nature

  he talked with her for a few min-
utes longer and got vague answers that
meant to him nothing for instance
when he asked her about any great bears
in that country she muttered indian
words under her breath until he asked
her again and again and then she told

him long time big bear kill- and

that was as much as she spoke intelli-
gibly shelton wanted to know if bur-
neys father was killed in these hills and
she shook her head and pointed an arm 
to the northward

  montana she said quite plainly
long time aleck-lilly-boy which
seemed definite enough surely as far as
it went if she had seen anything of a
bear in this neighborhood she kept the
fact to herself also she seemed not
to know much about caves no see
she would mutter and point to her eyes
neither could shelton discover where
she lived or whether she had any family
to take care of her

  so presently he left her sitting there
like a bundle of old clothes thrown in a
heap upon a rock and went on down
the canon

  shelton used his compass freely and
by climbing laboriously over the ridge
to his right he got at last into the canon
he knew after that he began looking
for dutch without any very cheering
prospect of finding him and he turned
his toes toward the sunbeam and
plodded up the bluff to the upland
thinking more of his own physical dis-
comfort than of the bear whose hide
he claimed for a rug he had things
in plenty to write home to the folks
but he was not caring much about it
just then he had wasted the day to no
purpose and it was growing dusky
again and he was ravenously hungry
with that hunger which the newcomer
the spook hills mystery



to the mountain states finds it so hard
to appease

  and then he began to feel that he
was being watched and followed he
stopped once behind a rock and waited
his jaw set to the point of stubbornness
and his gun leveled upon the way he
had come he waited for several min-
utes and went on disgustedly feeling
that he had no time to fool away if he
meant to get home before midnight
and when he went on he knewt that
something else went on cautiously
watchfully upon his trail

  curiously enough he was not afraid
he was filled with a baffled anger be-
cause he could neither shake off the
feeling nor catch a glimpse of the thing
that caused it he felt as the dark
settled down upon the sageland and left
him even more completely isolated than
he had been with the near company of
the hills like a child who has been
teased to a sulky petulance i think
that shelton must have owned an un-
usual amount of native courage for
under it all was forming a grim de-
termination to run the thing to earth
in spite of everything his panic in
the cave he called a fluke a mere trick
of the nerves and he may have been
right in that he intended to go back
and make a thorough search and he
debated within himself the advisability
of trying to enlist the help of the boys
he did not believe they were really
afraid of the spook he did not be-
lieve they were afraid of anything on
earth when jou came right down to
cases-which goes to prove that shelton
c sherman was not after all a fool
he was merely a young cub of a man
who was growing up faster than he or
any one realized thanks to the rugged
life he was leading that threw him more
or less upon his own resources

  he dragged his weary bones into the
bunk house just when the boys were
smoking their last before-bedtime cig-
arettes and wondering what had went

with shep-i am using their vernacular
understand and i realize that it is a
long way from being correct english

  why hello shep spooky greeted
him with a very sincere relief in his
tone whether lie was conscious of it
or not we wras just talking about
ketching you up and putting a bell on
yuh youre gitting to be such a little

stray lamb- spooky saw then that

something was wrong and he neglected
to finish his sentence while he eyed
shelton through a haze of smoke

  shelton had slumped down upon a
bench as if he did not care whether he
ever moved again or not his face
was pale under the new coat of sun-
burn and his eyes were sunken and
had purple shadows beneath and the
muscles of his cheeks sagged with com-
plete physical exhaustion spider
looked yawned and stretched his arms
with an ostentatious casualness and got
up from the bed which he had been
occupying lavishly with sprawled limbs

  better come and lay down shep
he suggested carelessly when shelton
made no move he went over and took
him by the arm as though he was im-
pressing obedience upon a child that
bunks a whole lot more able and will-
ing to hold you up than that pore little
bench he explained and led the boy
to the bed and pushed him gently down
upon it he pulled a pillow under
sheltons inert head stooped and lifted
sheltons dragging feet and laid them
comfortably pulled his own hat down
nearer his eyebrows and went out as
casually as he had spoke at first

  he was back before spooky and jim
had fairly begun questioning shelton
as to the cause of his all-in condition
and he carried the coffeepot and a plate
of beans and bread while a tin cup
hung by its handle from one finger

  here shep put yourself outside-a
some grub he commanded gruffly
coffees cold but itll do the biz
just the same-seeing you aint froze


the epopullcr magazine

he poured a cup of black muddy fluid
and compelled shelton to rise to an
elbow and drink every drop then he
pulled a box close to the bunk set the
plate upon it within easy reach of shel-
tons apathetic hand and sat down neg-
ligently upon the other bunk flicked the
ashes off his cigarette saw that it was
cold and fumbled for a match go
on and eat he urged lazily then
you can tell us how about it

  shelton ate a little and he told how
about it and the three listened at-
tentively and without banter while
pike snored raucously from a farther
corner of the room he told of the
cave and of the tracks and spider
leaned with an elbow on either knee
and his feet swinging over the side of
the bunk and smoked and stared at
the floor while he listened he told
of his panic of fright and of the scream
and the sound of running in the dark-
and spooky opened his mouth half an
inch and let it stay so and forgot to
smoke while he stared at sheltons hag-
gard face and listened to the tale jim
sat with his arms folded indian fashion
and chewed tobacco mechanically and
glanced now and then sidelong at the
other two wthile he listened

  and so sheltons story came down
to the old squaw sitting in a heap on
the rock in the canon and manifesting
such acuteness of hearing while her
vision seemed pitiably blurred-and he
told about her also and what she had
said about burneys father

  thats right jim testified stolidly
around his cud burneys father was
a squaw man up in montana he got
clawed up by a bear in the bitter root
country when burney was a kid i
thought the old woman was dead long
ago she had a deformed kid by old
man burney a feller that prospected
up in the bitter root mountains told
me about it a long time ago the kid
died it was half-witted or some darn

thing i thought the old woman was
dead too

  well she isnt it seems but shes
pretty wabbly in her mind said shel-
ton and went on with the story

  and say fellows he said earnestly
when he had described his long tramp
home and his belief that he had been
followed theres something behind all
this i dont know what but im going
to make it my business to find out

i dont believe burney killed those
sheep--

  what sheep interjected spider
lifting his head for the first time since
shelton began to talk

  why williams sheep vida told
me a lot of their sheep were killed
last night over the other side of that
long ridge of spook hills where her
uncle is camped with a band and
say fellows their necks were wrung
she said and she said that one of the
dogs-she called him laddie-ran out
and was killed also she said it had
been squashed so that its ribs were
broken and its neck twisted like the
sheep can you beat that she thinks
burney did it she says hes the only
one in the country strong enough-and
of course thats true as far as it goes
but i think it was that bear i saw
the tracks of

  a bear spooky asserted wouldnt
hardly kill sheep like that he might
come into a band and pack off one
or two and he might go through a band
just cuffing em right an left like that
spooky illustrated with thrashing arms
the cuffing process hed break their
necks i reckon if he done that-or cave
in their ribs or something but it dont
look natural-him grabbin every sheep
separate and wringin its neck that
looks to me more-human spooky
spoke with a certain reluctance and a
certain inquiring look toward spider

  didnt anybody see-it-or tracks
or- jim stopped to turn his to-
bacco cud
the spook hills mstery



  the sheep would tromp out any
tracks spider told him shortly shift-
ing his position a little without looking
up there was a certain warped board
in the floor which spider appeared to
find absorbingly interesting

   yeah-thats right assented jim

  why vida said her uncle ran out and
got a glimpse of him going off over a lit-
tle hill where he-where it came right
against the sky and-shelton uncon-
sciously lowered his voice and glanced
toward the door-she says her uncle
would swear it was burney she said
a person couldnt make any mistake in
a man like him but still-his head
dropped back wearily on the pillow-i
stick to the bear theory a bear would
go off on its hind legs wouldnt it
if it were carrying a sheep

  it might probably it would
spooky agreed relievedly yes come
to think of it i guess it would

  well i say it was that bear fel-
lows and im going to keep on hunt-
ing till i get him they think burnev
did it-

  burney was home last night wasnt
he spooky asked aggressively of no
one in particular how could it be
him

  spider cocked one eye in the direc-
tion of spooky lifted one eyebrow and
said never a word how did they know
whether burney was at home his look
asked the other as a matter of fact
it could be burney and each one of
the four knew that it could more
than that they knew that it probably
was burney even to shelton had he
admitted it the bear theory seemed a
little far-fetched still-it did not seem
quite like aleck burney to sneak into
a mans band and kill sheep by stealth
in that fashion burney would fight
as his men knew well but always he
had fought in the open and had seemed
to prefer that the odds should be against
him-if there were odds the very
bigness of him and strength of him had

always made him slow to take action
and the williams sheep had not yet
injured the sunbeam range nor had the
williams men done anything that might
be construed as a beginning of hostil-
ities true they were crowding close
-too close to be welcome neighbors-
and burney had ridden over and told
them so that much was perfectly log-
ical understandable-right and just ac-
cording to range ethics but to come
that same night and kill sheep under
the very nose of jake williams and to
sneak away afterward in the dark-
that was something at which even the
sunbeam partisans balked

  their talk dwindled after that shel-
ton wondered once or twice what could
have become of old dutch and spooky
told him that they would hunt him up
to-morrow spider went out and stayed
for a long time when he returned he
threw his hat down as if it had dis-
pleased him and had no more than a
grunt for spooky who showed a dis-
position to talk

  shelton lifted his head and looked
in spiders direction for a minute
say spider come over here and let
me whisper in your ear he said with
his old boyish tone ive got a sweet
little message that nobody but you must
hear come on-i promised her

  spider paused in the act of pulling
off a boot and eyed shelton crossly
caught a significant lowering of an eye-
lid dropped the boot and went and
bent over shelton listening and shel-
ton instead of giving a message asked
one question spiders light-blue eyes
looked steadily into sheltons for a sec-
ond before he answered and the lurk-
ing little devil in them had changed to
the gleam of steel

  gone he whispered and went back
and took off the other boot

  there were two in that cabin who
slept little that night and i think per-
haps spooky was inclined to lie awake

chapter viii

  vida williams hard of eye and lips
hot from hard riding and looking ready
to fight the whole sunbeam outfit rode
up to the cabin and pulled her right
foot out of the stirrup ready to dis-
mount but when she saw spider and
shelton coming toward her from the
stable-they having seen her ride by-
she stayed in the saddle and waited
glumly till they came up

  wheres goliath  she demanded
shortly with never a greeting

  in the cabin i guess good morn-
ing miss vida will you meet-well
spider is all the name i know that be-
longs to him this is miss williams
spider

  miss williams gave spider a glance
and a nod far from cordial i want
to see goliath-and i want to see him
quick she said i wish youd call
him out

  spider went at once to the cabin and
opened the door theres a lady wants
to see you burney he called within
and turned back shelton was asking
vida what was the matter and wouldnt
she get off her horse and rest a while
and vida was giving him short an-
swers that told him nothing except that
her mood was villainous and her time
limited

  burney bending his shoulders for-
ward to save his head a bump appeared
in the doorway stared at vida for a
minute with his little deep-set twin-
kling eyes and came up to her he
was so big that vidas horse was afraid
of him and when he saw that he
stopped and came forward more slowly
when he stood finally within ten feet
of her their eyes were nearly on a
level

  you wanted to see me he asked
her in his high falsetto voice

  i wanted to ask you whats your

object in killing off our sheep the way
youre doing vida stated harshly not
one whit abashed by the size of him
you may have poppy buffaloed and
uncle jake but you cant scare me
and ive come over to tell you mr
goliath that if you kill another sheep
of ours im going to watch my chance
and plant a bullet where it will do the
most good you aint easy to miss you
know

  i aint killed any sheep of yours
burney denied reddening perceptibly
under her angry gaze i didnt know
thered been any sheep killed when
was it

  last night and night before last and
you neednt try to make xue believe
you dont know who else could grab
up a sheep and wring its neck and
break its ribs just by squeezing night
before last it was uncle jakes band
and last night it wjas ours-and last
night you killed twenty before i got
out where i could take a shot at you
in the dark i missed-

  it wasnt me burney told her
again ive never been near your camp
except the other day-in the morning
i told your father to keep away from
piute hills miss williams if youre
sensible youll get your father to move
his sheep back the other way i
cant-

  we aint going to move and you
cant make us move vidas voice
sharpened almost to shrewishness
poppy might get scared out-but i
wont let him move thats open range
over there and were going to have our
share you neednt think you can hog
all the grass in the country and you
neednt think you can come sneaking
into our band at night and kill sheep
till youre tired and not get some of
your own medicine i-oh i wish i
could take you and wrring your neck
just like you done to the sheep tears
of rage were in her voice just be-
cause youre big as all outdoors you
the spook hills mystery



think you can run us out but you cant
-youve got another think coming if

you was twice as big-

  burney took a step nearer the
crimson had left his face so that he
looked actually pale miss williams
i never killed your sheep i dont want
to have any trouble with your father
unless he drives me to it i aint a
quarrelsome man avhen im left alone
but i cant afford to buy your folks
out again-i done that once and lost
money on the deal i lost a lot of
money and i cant afford to lose no
more miss williams im in debt as
it is ive got to make my cattle puli
me out or else im liable to go under
and it aint fair for your father to
bring in sheep on me i need the range
for my own stock i-dont want to
act meanabout it miss williams but
-you better talk your father into mov-
ing back-

  sure i will-not burneys apolo-
getic manner might astonish the boys
but it failed altogether to impress vida
were in just as bad a fix as you are
-and theres three of us to think of
and only one of you were in debt
ourselves and weve got to make the
sheep pull us out and we need the
range you know just as well as i
do that the feeds poor back toward
pillar butte we aint going to back
off for you or anybody else and wre
aint going to set down and suck our
thumbs while you kill off our sheep
just to be mean i said before and
ill say it again-and i want you to
remember it all of you  if you kill
another single solitary sheep ill take
a shot at you-in daylight when i can
see where to shoot she swung her
horse away from the giant so if you
think youre going to make anything
off us that way go to it im taking
a hand in this killing game myself
but i aint like you i aint going to
sneak up on you after dark ill play
my hand on top of the table you kill

our sheep and ill kill you-and take
chances on the jury

  she looked at shelton and then at
spider turned her face away and then
faced them grimly you both hear-
i mean it she said defiantly to them
maybe it aint ladylike but i cant help
that ive got to be human first and
if somebody in our outfit has got to
wrade in and fight id rather it would
be me than poppy or uncle jake-ill
stand more show in court if it comes
to that

 making capital out of your
sex shelton reproved mildly you
wouldnt do that miss vida

  oh-wouldnt i vida curled her
lip at him in a way to crimple his van-
ity why not women never do
get a square deal anyway you men
dont show any squeamishness about
making capital of our sex do you 
you take every advantage of us that
you can get so when we know where
to hit your weak points i believe in
aiming for them and if it came to
working a bunch of mutts in the jury
box in order to get a square deal you
can bet your hat id work them to a
fare-you-well men are the limit any-
way she laughed at him in a way to
redden his whole face look at you
for instance youd like to flirt a little
and make me think you were it just
because youre lonesome and pm the
only girl in the country you wouldnt
give a whoop for my feelings just so
you were amused isnt that straight
and is it fair isnt that making cap-
ital out of my sex and mr burney
here-because hes big and strong and
can lord it over common men-he thinks
i dont count just because im a girl
he passes me up as if i didnt have
any interest in them sheep over there
oh you all-every darned one of you
-think im a white chip in the game
-less than a white chip im a girl
-so all i can do is talk well-you


the popular magazine

i

go ahead the way youve started out
and see

  she sent them a cold gray glance all
round antagonistic with the bitter an-
tagonism of the consciously weak gave
her head a little defiant toss and struck
her horse down the rump with her
quirt so she rode away from the sun-
beam and the three turned and watched
her in dead silence

  shed shoot all right-believe me
spider commented when she was no
more than a bobbing black object
against the sunlit sage

  i never killed their sheep burney
muttered complainingly but if they

keep crowding up on my range-

he turned sullenly and went back into
the cabin and left the two standing
there in that passive attitude which is
the natural reaction after a high-ten-
sioned incident

  well come on shep lets go out
after dutch spider turned away to-
ward the stables looks like things
are beginning to tighten

  shall we take candles shelton
fell into pace beside him and found
that the pace required long strides and
swift

  sure well take candles might as
well make a clean sweep shep-if you
aint scared to go back

  id go whether im scared or not
shelton declared firmly but im not
-as far as i can feel any symptoms-
oh shucks he added impatiently
whats the use of hedging what do
you think of vidas stand pretty
nervy for a girl to face burney that

way dont you think and she-

  yeah-skate a little closer shep
what about them sheep 

  shelton however did not care to
skate over that particular bit of ice
he said he didnt know and changed
the subject whereat spider grinned to
himself and then became much occupied
with his own thoughts

  well right over behind that cut-off
butte is the canon where the cave is
shelton drew up on the east side of
a pinnacle and pointed we can get

down into the big canon-

  yeah-i know- that big canon ive
been in it thats where i was trailing
a lion when-something commenced to
foller me spider cupped his palms
around a match blaze might have
been a link he conceded when his cig-
arette was lighted and he had blown
out the match these hills is full of
animals a man never sees ive been
thinking maybe it was a link you heard
in the cave or a lion didnt you hap-
pen to notice any round tracks-like a
great big cat tracks about that big
say with his bent fingers he in-
closed a circle larger than a cup just
by way of encouragement

  no but i did see a bears track
and i saw burneys tracks too he

added doggedly i hate to-

  i dont know why burney wouldnt
have as much license to go into a cave
as you had spider cut in dryly

  well i suppose he has got but
he dont want any one to come over
here-and then comes himself and
then-there are those sheep vida claims
were killed

  and thats why said spider calmly
im going to ride over that way and
take a look no telling which way
dutch went seeing he didnt come back
to the ranch-and thats mighty funny
too were liable to find him over that
way darn it spider went on in a
tone of complete bafflement there aint
one solitary fact that lines up with
any other fact thats what gets me
you saw bear tracks in that cave-
and you heard something scream you
claim and only a mountain lion or a
link would make the kinda noise you
say you heard vida says burney killed
their sheep-and burney aint that
kinda man as i know him and ive
worked for him over two years now
the spook hills mystery



burney says he never went near their
camp except one morning-and he was
gone last night somewhere i got up
about one oclock and his horse and
saddle was missing and i went down
again at three and they was there and
he was gone when i went out just be-
fore we went to bed and i cant
figure out any errand that would take
him out all night and i never knowed
burney to lie gosh hes so ungodly
big he dont have to lie his say-so
comes pretty near going as she lays

  and to pile the agony up still higher
theres dutch there aint no reason
why if he was scairt off from where
you left him he wouldnt come straight
on home-and he never come oh
thunder said spider as a brief way
of summing up his perplexities come
on shep well go take a look at them
dead sheep for a starter i know about
where old williams would be camped
and after that well take a look at the
cave

  to look at the dead sheep was easy
the williams camp had moved since
daylight but when they saw the white-
topped wagon moving in leisurely
fashion up nearer the hills and farther
away the moving patch of gray which
was the sheep they swung in on the
trail and followed it back to where
spider knew was a spring

  there they found the dead sheep
lately skinned for their pelts and left
to fatten the coyotes spider forced
his horse close to the fly-blackened car-
casses and sat there looking down with
frowning brows every sheep had its
neck twisted to dislocation and nearly
every sheep had been squeezed flat-
squashed vida had called it he raised
his head and studied the low ridges and
correspondingly shallow gullies of that
vicinity he scowled down again at
the skinned carcasses he looked across
at shep who was hovering agitatedly
in the immediate background because
of his horses distaste for dead sheep

and he hunched his shoulders and rode
away

  well what was it-a bear shel-
ton quizzed him after an expectant
silence

  ask the sheep suggested spider
and added they can tell you as
much about it as i can

  but what do you think shelton
remember was of the persistent type
of individual

  im thinkin damns right now
mostly said spider

  shelton did not cover himself with
honor that day to begin with he
could not find the canon that ended
in the crude amphitheater where was
the cave he led spider into two blind
pockets in the hills and in each in-
stance he discovered only after a pro-
longed search that it was not the right
canon he persisted in riding with too
loose a rein in spite of spiders repeated
warnings and profane instructions and
the horse shied unexpectedly and vio-
lently and threw shelton into a patch
of brush and bolted while shelton
thrashed around in there trying to get
out spider chased the horse a quarter
of a mile over some nasty rocks and
washouts before he caught him and led
him back-and you can judge what his
temper was like after that

  being unable to find the canon that
held the cave shelton could not find
the gulch in which he had seen the
old squaw he had scraped the skin
off one forearm in falling and had hurt
his knee so that he found walking pain-
ful and he was not enthusiastic over
riding either the sun blazed down
upon them more pitilessly than it had
done before that spring-there were
plenty of reasons for the sulky silence
that held the two at last

  and then just when they were pick-
ing their way gingerly across a steep
sidehill to where a bare ridge gave
promise of a precarious trail into the
canon they must cross if they would


the popular magazine

reach the sunbeam without riding an
extra ten miles spiders sharp eyes
caught a glimpse of something moving
along the opposite side of the canon
he pulled up and stared steadily shad-
ing his eyes with his hand like the
pictures of indian chiefs gazing out to
the setting sun

  when shelton looking also and see-
ing far less than did spider asked what
it was spider told him that shelton
could search him and went on in the
same moody silence

  shelton waited a minute longer

  it looked to me like a bear he
volunteered when he overtook spider
or else maybe it was a cow did you
see it go behind those rocks 

  spider grunted and let shelton in-
terpret the sound to please himself it
was not until they descended into the
canon bottom that spider was surprised
into speech they came full upon
dutch feeding dispiritedly upon the
scanty grass there dutch had neither
saddle nor bridle or anything upon him
save the marks of hard riding and a
twisted rope that hobbled his front feet
so that he must hop if he would move
forward

  spider got off his horse and went up
and examined closely the hobble well

ill be- he began and leaving the

sentence unfinished squatted on his
heels that he might pick the knots loose
and free poor dutch

  did somebody try to steal him 
shelton was looking on round-eyed
from a respectful distance why that
isnt rope-what is it

  spider stood up with the thing in
his hands dont you know what that
is he demanded more humanly than
he had spoken to shelton for three
hours that there is a strip cut from
a fresh sheep pelt with the wool hacked
off with a knife

  shelton had a gleam of understand-
ing he couldnt get far with his feet
tied together he said dont you

suppose if we looked all around here
we might find some tracks

  i expect we might

  with that encouragement shelton
dismounted awkwardly because of his
knee and went limping back and forth
where the soil gave promise of receiv-
ing and holding tracks it was spider
who discovered some trace and he puz-
zled over the tracks-there were three
close beside a crumbling washout where
the bank was sandy-much longer than
shelton who limped up thought was
necessary

  oh say he jubilated thats the
bear whose track i saw the other day

if we could just follow it up-

  spider turned and looked at him sar-
castically you sure are an observa-
tive cuss he commented dryly take
another look at them three tracks how
high do you figure a bear would have
to be to step as long as that he
placed one foot beside the first track
and stepped out with the other toward
the next track spider was not a small
man by any means yet his longest stride
fell short of the second bear track

  shelton watched him and grasped his
meaning then-what the deuce do
you think it is if it isnt a bear he
wanted to know when spider stood off
looking again at the tracks

  spider looked up at him and hesi-
tated just between you and me and
the gatepost shep ill tell yuh what
it is its a man trying to make out
like lies a bear wearing bear fixins
on his feet i take it he explained
further to hide his own tracks-and
making a dern poor stagger at it if
you ask me 

  shelton looked long at spider and
then down at the tracks he followed
spiders example he placed his foot
alongside the first track and measured
the stride with the other shelton you
know was six feet two and at that he
had to step as far as he could reach
the spook hills mystery



in order to place his foot alongside that
second track he looked up quickly

  well theres only one-

  spider stopped him with a gesture
and a look some things is better
off inside your head he told shelton
bluntly we cant help what we think
but we neednt go around shooting off
our faces call it a bear track and let
it go at that  i aint going to build
up nothing on a few marks in the sand
and you aint he glanced moodily
toward dutch weve found what we
was hunting lets be drifting toward
home

  he stopped first and scraped the edge
of his boot sole carefully over the tracks
until they were quite obliterated then
he took his rope and tied an end around
the neck of the browrn horse shelton
had been riding i guess you might as
well ride dutch back he observed
youre a heap safer on him and he
changed the saddle quickly as if he were
in haste to be gone

  shelton was studying the mystery
that had enveloped him in the last week
while they rode a mile or so then it
had to come out-some of it-in speech

  what i cant see he said suddenly
is what object hed have aside from
scaring off williams and his sheep it
looks-well childish to go around the

country-

  i dont know quelled spider as
youre expected to see any object in
it i dont know as any one is

  that did not settle the other how-
ever well it doesnt account for my

being followed-

  if you was followed

  nor that screaming and running in

the cave-

  if you didnt just imagine it

  oh say shelton protested what

do you think i-

  aw cried spider impatiently
cant you get some kinda gait on that
old skate and if you dont-keep your

face shut he added unkindly youre
liable to get sunstruck on your insides

  as you may guess there was little
conversation between them after that
spider seemed to be revolving some in-
tricate puzzle in his mind and shelton
i think was sulking because of spiders
bluntness of speech

  they came slowly down the hill and
up to the high pole corral beside the
stable and when they dismounted bur-
ney himself came out of the corral
carrying his saddle in one hand

  ive got to go to pocatello he told
them querulously i may not be back
for three or four days you kinda keep

things moving spider- then he

seemed to notice dutch for the first
time oh you found him he said
with feeble interest where was he
at

  over in the spook hills said
spider distinctly looking up into bur-
neys little twinkling eyes in a gulch
hobbled with a strip of sheep hide we
couldnt find the saddle and bridle

  burney looked down at him sharply
before he turned away toward his own
horse some of them sheep-herders
caught him up most likely he said
carelessly might as well let the sad-
dle go didnt amount to much-and
we dont want to have any trouble with
em if we can help it dont want any
trouble with anybody he muttered
while he saddled hastily the girl
thinks i killed their sheep he
mounted and without farewell or fur-
ther orders he rode away while spider
stared after him meditatively

chapter ix

  burney had not yet returned from
pocatello-indeed he had been gone
not much longer than twenty-four hours
when vida williams came riding again
to the sunbeam riding a heaving-
flanked sweat-roughened pony and
looking harder of lip and eye than be-


the popular magazine

fore spooky had just called to the
boys to come and get it-meaning
supper-and he stood now in the cabin
doorway with his hands on his hips
waiting for them to appear then came
vida galloping straight down the trail
from the hills and never deigning to
pull up or turn out when she overtook
shelton and spider and jim the boys
ducked out of her way and came on
in the cloud of dust kicked up by her
ponys flying heels

  vida swung down from her horse
and walked purposefully toward spooky
in the doorway her sunburned braid
of hair was roughened in the wind
her denim riding skirt was stained with
her ponys sweat her face was pale
under the freckles and tan and her eyes
-well her eyes held the light of battle
a six-shooter swung at one slim hip
and as she neared the cabin she jerked
the gun from its scabbard and held it
hanging at her side without any more
definite reason than that one action
the boys broke into a trot and so came
presently up to her

  wheres burney she asked more
quietly than one would expect from the
look of heithough it was the quiet
that spells danger

  burneys in pocatello shelton vol-
unteered before spooky had more than
opened his mouth he went yester-
day-early in the afternoon

  you lie vida turned and flung
the words at him as a driver flicks his
lash her breath was coming quickly
and unevenly she was holding herself
to calmness and it was not easy as
they could see where is he you
might as well produce him she said
eying them one after the other with
that cold antagonism which she could
make one feel with a glance

  she met blank surprise in every pair
of eyes into which she looked and she
bit her lip and pushed the gun back
into its scabbard

  well anyway he isnt in pocatello

she asserted defiantly because he was
over on the east ridge of piute hills
about three hours ago he-he killed
uncle jake

 no you dont-

  he did i and ill kill him on sight
-so help me he-boys that man is
a fiend i-dont blame you boys-i
dont believe you had anything to do

with it or know-

  spider took a step nearer youre
dead right miss williams he told
her with that quiet earnestness which
was spiders way sometimes if youd
tell us-we dont know a thing about
it we-burney left for pocatello yes-
terday

  well it was a blind then because
this afternoon-i guess it wras early-
and uncle jake was herding a band of
ewes and lambs on that long slope from
the big hill and he was killed-her
eyes widened with the horror of it-
just like the sheep have been killed
she caught her breath and went on as
if she were anxious to tell the thing
and be done with it he was just
grabbed-from behind i guess-and-
his neck was twisted-just like the
sheep

  spider leaned and gripped her by the
arm girl are- you sure of that
and his tone was stern

  its the truth and uncle jakes
pretty strong himself and-he didnt
have a ghost of a show i-i saw him
and his head was twisted way around
-like that she turned her head far
to one side and spider shivered and
let go her arm

  the four of them stared at her in-
credulously the thing was too mon-
strous for them to grasp all in a minute

  killed said shelton just above
his breath are you sure maybe
he wasnt dead

  vida turned and eyed him scornfully
and seemed to think the remark too
puerile for reply

  wasnt there any sign of a scuffle
the spook hills mystery



asked spooky -didnt anybody see
it

  he was out alone with just the
one dog vida explained turning to-
ward him poppy and i rode over to
see him-because some more of our
sheep was killed last night and wre
wanted to see if uncle jake had been
bothered and what he thought we better
do about it poppy wanted to swear
out a warrant and-we found him-
like that he-he wasnt cold yet

  no there wasnt any sign of any-
thing he just laid there like hed been
grabbed up and then throwed down
again it was on a little rocky ridge
i suppose he was setting on the ridge
where he could see the sheep and bur-
ney just crawled up on him from be-
hind he could easy enough its all
little ridges and washouts there where
the water has gullied out the sidehill
and burney-

  what makes you keep on saying
burney spooky asked her somewhat
aggressively you want to be kinda
careful about saying--

  who else but burney could a done
that she countered hotly could you
grab a man the size of uncle jake and
twist his neck clear around so you broke
it and him not able to put up a fight
even it aint easv to do i should
think

  no spider agreed it aint easy
to do at the same time-

  and who else would wrant to she
demanded uncle jake never had any
trouble with anybody around here bxit
burney and hes been trying his best
to drive us off ever since we came in
with our sheep and that aint all
she stopped and bit her lips again and
fingered the sagging gun belt her
blind rage was cooling with speech and
the unspoken sympathy of these four
and she seemed almost reluctant to go
on she was growing more normal--
more like the vida williams whom

shelton had met out on the high
stretches of the piute foothills

  that aint all i aint the killing
kind-but id a killed burney when
i rode up if id seen him it would
take a lot to make me do that too i
-i was putting up a bluff the other
day she owned with a faint flush of
embarrassment i was mad a-course
and if id been a man id a tried to
lick him i reckon but this is differ-
ent i know he killed uncle jake i
didnt see him but i seen his tracks
down in the gully right behind where
uncle jake was its plain as print-
and there aint a man in the country
thats got feet the size of his is
there 

  there was no need of her emphatic
question they all knew there was not

  i guess we better ride over sug-
gested spider after a minute if bur-
ney didnt go to pocatello we can easy
find it out a man like him aint going
to be overlooked and if he done what

you say he done- spider stopped

short and when he continued it was
from a new angle of thought ive
knowed him a long while he said
and ive never knowed a thing against
him at the same time you never do
know all thats in a man he turned
toward spooky challengingly i aint
going to back any low-down play like
chokin a man to death just because he
owns a bunch-a sheep he stated flatly
whether its burney or my own
brother

  same here pete jim shifted his
cud to say-diffidently because of the
girl

  well come on and eat seeings its
ready urged spooky and then well
hit the high places to make up there
aint nothing in startin out empty if
theys tracks he said to the girl well
foiler em up you better come in and
have something to eat

  i-couldnt she told him and
looked into the cabin and shuddered


the cpocpular magazine

but she sat upon a box near the door
and drank a cup of hot coffee which
shelton brought her i just cant go
in she apologized to him and spider
who had lingered outside its like the
den of some beast to me i-i just
keep seeing uncle jake-and i can just
see burney creeping up the ridge be-
hind him

  you want to cut that out said
spider youll get nerves for fair if
you dont keep your mind off it i
guess ill take my coffee outside too

  which he did somewhat to the dis-
gust of shelton who felt that vida
was in his especial charge in spite of
her pitiless analysis of his motives per-
haps because of it-for he had cer-
tainly thought a great deal about vida
since then

  the sun was low when they rode
away from the sunbeam close-grouped
and silent they climbed the hill and gal-
loped straight away through the sage
and lava rocks toward where spook
hills hunched their black shoulders
against the sky grim of lip somber-
eyed they hurried out to look upon
the telltale footprints which branded
their boss a murderer of the foulest
type

  spooky and jim not having seen the
things which had planted in spiders
mind the seeds of distrust were in-
clined to be incredulous still they
were going to see for themselves be-
fore they would believe as to shel-
ton he glanced often at spider in the
hope of meeting his look of under-
standing and he was plainly puzzled
at spiders coldly noncommittal glance

  they rode with the girl between
them but they did not talk to her very
much she did not seem to want them
to talk her eyes were frequently
blurred with tears and her lips were
trembling for she had lived a lonely
life with but few persons who were
more to her than strangers and al-
though uncle jake had been an utterly

commonplace individual for whom she
felt no definite affection he was her
uncle and he had helped to fill her life
-and she had lately looked upon him
dead so now that the first shock of
horror had passed and she had sensed
the sympathy of these men who were
logically her enemies but essentially her
friends she was feeling the sorrow of
a personal loss

  you mustnt mind if poppy talks
mean she said once when they were
nearing the hills hes awful worked
up over this he blames the whole sun-
beam outfit he said hed shoot the
first one of you he got sight of-but
he wont poppy-just talks like that

  unconsciously she had revealed
where lay the heaviest weight of re-
sponsibility for the family welfare
her own slim shoulders drooped under
their burden her tone betrayed the
fact that she was stronger than her
father who just talked like that she
would have fought and fought hard
in defense of their property her poppy
talked

  spider sensing it all turned and
looked at her pityingly in the dusk
his hand went out and clasped briefly
her arm

  dont you worry he said so low
that the others could not hear ill see
you through with this-if nobody else
will

  vida turned her face toward him
and she did not pull her arm away
i know you will she told him simply
i-dont feel so alone as i did a few
hours ago

  spiders fingers slid down her arm
and clasped her hand close and let it
go in this wise did he take the oath
of fealty and none but vida knew any-
thing about it not even shelton who
was inclined to be watchful of spider
during the last couple of hours

  it was dark long before they reached
the gruesome slope where jake wil-
liams lay as he had been found a
the spook hills mystery



camp fire blazed up into the dark and
beside it the figure of a man flared into
distinct outlines and faded into vague
shadows as they rode closer they saw
him lift his head and listen looking
their way he had a rifle and he
pointed it toward them with a menac-
ing gesture the firelight must have
blinded him however he stood up and
craned then ducked suddenly back into
the shadows beyond the light of the
flames a spurt of fire and the sharp
crack of his rifle showed how he had
mentally placed the newcomers but the
bullet sang its song of flight high over
their heads

  quit that shooting ive just

brought the boys- vida kicked

her horse and plunged ahead where the
firelight touched her and quite envel-
oped her in its golden glow put down
that gun and come in outa the dark
she commanded impatiently theres
nothing to be scared of has pete got
back yet

  no her father came slowly for-
ward his bushy beard quite concealing
any emotion his face might otherwise
have revealed who are these men
he challenged

  theyre some boys from the sun-
beam they came over to do what they
can they want to look around and
try and pick up the tracks but its
pretty dark for that unless we can
make torches do

  i dont want no sunbeamers prowl-
in around my camp i wont have it
neither but he stood there passive
while they dismounted the sunbeam
has done about all the damage it needs
to do i aint going to stand fer no
more monkey business now i can tell
yuh

  vida had dismounted and she turned
her back upon him as if he were not
speaking over here-a couple of you
bring torches and you can see for your-
selves she was saying to the boys
while her father was still speaking

and you can see the tracks too i
dont want you to take my word for a
thing i told poppy not to move him-
we just covered him up is all we sent
pete out after the sheriff you know-
and the coroner so be careful about
your own tracks till we get a light
you can see from one side i think-
just keep back so things dont get
mixed all up

  she was taking the lead quite natu-
rally--one suspected that she had been
in the habit of asserting her superior
intelligence in every emergency-but her
voice was harsh with the repression
she had put upon herself spider picked
a blazing sage branch from the fire and
moved up alongside her

  you neednt come he said you
can stay back by the fire

  no im going to see the thing
through she told him ive got to
i stand for our side and you-you nat-
urally stand for-the other

  spider knew that she had meant to
say burney and could not bring her-
self to mentioning his name

  she stood back a little when he
stooped and pulled off the dirty square
of canvas that covered the dead man
she did not retreat but still she stood
with her face averted a little and her
eyes drooping so that they saw only
the rusty run-down-at-the-heel boots
of her uncle jake with the deep hard
creases which time and weather give
to cheap footwear in a minute she
looked up at the faces of the four bent
forward while they stared in absolute
silence the flicker of the torch flames
upon their faces gave that weird rem-
brandt effect which stirs vague savage
instincts in ones blood their brows
were frowning unconsciously their
breath sucked in at the horror they
looked upon

  spider bent closer put out a reluc-
tant hand and felt the crushed bones
in the neck with his finger tips he
lifted an arm and felt along the ribs


the popular magazine

then he stood up drew in his breath
sharply and backed away it was
spooky looking true to his nickname
who replaced the grimy canvas

  whereabouts are the tracks spi-
der asked the girl who gave a great
sigh of sheer nervous reaction and
turned from the still covered heap

  down here ill show you she
took his arm and led him around the
great flat outcropping of lava rock upon
which her uncle must have been sitting
when surprised from behind let me
take the torch we want to keep back
ourselves he came up on these rocks
i guess there aint any mark till you
get down in the bottom of the gully

  she led spider down the rocky bank
the other three following at the bot-
tom she stopped and passed the smol-
dering brand slpwly above the sand hes-
itated while she looked back up the
bank to get the line fixed in her mind
and went forward again

  spider caught her hand and pulled
her back protectively

  let me look he took the torch
whirled it around his head to fan the
blaze and bent forward searching

  he found it and stopped the plain
imprint of a boot-long wide pressed
deep into the soft soil with the weight
of the man who trod there-burneys
boot without a shadow of doubt to
cloud spiders certainty and the toe
was pointed up the bank toward where
the dead man lay crumpled upon one
side with the bones of his neck crushed
and his head twisted horribly upon his
shoulder a long stride down the gully
-a long stride for spider that is
-was another track to match the first

  spider waited until the others had
come up bent down and looked upon
the tracks then holding vida by the
hand he picked his way slowly down
the gully other tracks he found
tracks leading away from the place-
leading toward the gloomy scars of the
mountain a mile or so away

  down the gully across the wider
depression and part way up the farther
hill they went there the burning
brands died to charred embers wink-
ing sullen red eyes at them they
stopped and gave much time to the
making of other torches while vida sat
down on the steep slope and waited
a huddled little figure under the stars
a lonely little figure who gave no re-
sponse when shelton tried to lighten
the quest with talk

  she sat with her elbows upon her
knees and her chin in her cupped palms
and stared at the great dipper tilted
brim up toward the north star be-
hind her a week-old moon slid out from
behind a cloud bank where it had been
hiding and stood a moment upon the
highest peak of the mountain before
it dropped down into the shadow world
beyond in the somber camp across
the ridge a sheep dog barked shrilly

  vida lifted her head thinking the
boys had lighted their torches unknown
to her she turned looked up the long
slope silvered briefly by the moon gave
a little start and sprang suddenly to
her feet

  spider look oh there he is-i
saw him on the hill looking down at
us

  spider dropped the match he had
been nursing between his palms looked
the way she was pointing a shaking
finger and leaped forward running up
the hill he too had seen just for an
instant a huge dark figure outlined
against the crescent moon

  at his first move it disappeared but
he ran on his six-shooter in its scab-
bard under his hand vida ran after
him panting a little toward the last
behind them came spooky and jim and
shelton who had been slower to start
and not having seen the figure were
more hazy as to their reasons for run-
ning at all

  at the last spider and vida climbed
side by side more slowly too breathless
the spook hills mystery



to do more than gasp a word now and
then and when they finally reached
the top and stood looking down into
the deep jagged canon beyond where
the moon could not send a jingle faint
ray but only made the shadows blacker
in contrast to the lightened hilltop they
knew that there was nothing more to
be done for burney running down-
hill with those immense strides of which
he was capable while they panted la-
boriously up the other side at that min-
ute could easily be half a mile from
there and a half mile in such a place
was just as good as a hundred so far
as their chance of overtaking him was
concerned

chapter x

  they went back to camp looking fre-
quently behind them fearfully too if
the truth were known they offered
to relieve williams from his mournful
vigil and were repulsed with such a
tone of finality that they could not well
insist so spider and shelton convoyed
the girl to her camp wagon and left
her there while spooky and jim went
back to the sunbeam

  spider did not feel like leaving her
altogether alone he told shelton when
they had ridden well away from the
wagon a man who wtould kill as jake
williams had been killed he asserted
might do any horrific thing and the
girl had threatened burney and had
probably won his enmity even though
he had given no sign of it in their
presence for that matter neither had
he given signs of any murderous in-
tent toward the williams men

  im going to stick around till morn-
ing anyway said spider and if
he does come back itll just about be
a case of shoot first and ask him what
he wants afterward i believe the mans
crazy myself

  you believe he did it then shel-
ton questioned in an awed tone it
ca

doesnt seem possible burney always
acted-

  maybe it aint possible spider re-
torted glumly but theres the dead
man-you seen him yourself and you
seen how he was killed and you seen
the tracks leading up the hill behind
him

  say those tracks-they wont be
there to-morrow shelton said impul-
sively spooky scraped them all out
with his foot as he went past like
you scraped out the tracks over there
where we found old dutch

  hunh said spider but all the
same i could swear i seen burney up
on top of the hill looking down at us

  but if he went to pocatello how
could he get back so quickly shel-
ton eased his long legs down in a sandy
spot where they had stopped in plain
sight of the white-topped wagon and
yet far enough away to relieve the girl
from any sense of being watched

  if he went to pocatello spider re-
peated meaningly i kinda believe he
did go but if he did he sure didnt
stay long you seen his tracks didnt
you and a man cant leave his tracks
around where he aint been can he
he snuggled down behind a rock and
made himself a cigarette where the glow
of it could not be seen at the wagon
everything points to burney he went
oh musingly after he had smoked for
a time in silence i believe it wras him

done it at the same time- he

settled his hat more firmly upon his
head at the same time ive got a
hunch he didnt theres something in
this deal that dont look right to me
unless you lied or was crazy theres
things that burney dont seem to fit
into

  i know it shelton conceded gloom-
ily he doesnt fit into any of it as
i see it anything except those tracks
and it has occurred to me he added
moving closer to the other that you or
i or anybody could put on a pair of


the populacr magazine

burneys- boots and make big tracks
spider it would be a clever way of
hiding our own tracks wouldnt it
and if these williams men had an en-
emy it would be a pretty smooth way
of shifting suspicion-

  it would if he could take as long
steps as burney spider cut in dryly
you couldnt step in them tracks shep
-and youre taller than the average
man

  a fellow could step that jar
by-

  a scream-a shrill womans scream
-brought them both to their feet their
hearts thumping wildly they ran
leaping long through the sage and rocks
shelton stumbled over a root and went
headlong and spider went on with-
out knowing why he did so he shouted
-and in the faint starlight a great dark
form left the wagon and went tearing
off along the ridge over where the
sheep lay huddled the dogs barked and
barked with growlings rumbling be-
tween the sharp staccato of their
clamor

  spider reached the wagon out of
breath and weak with terror for the
girl vida he gasped when he could
lay hand on the wheel vida-for
god sake girl

  from over his head she answered
him pushing open the narrow door in
the canvas wagontop oh i-oh spi-
der  he-came she crouched in
the doorway her hand reaching out so
that she could touch spiders shoulder
for comfort how did you happen
to be here she asked breathlessly
after a minute

  spider pulled himself together and
climbed up beside her we never
left he said we was standing
guard i was afraid maybe-- what
did he do

  vida shivered i was trying to get
to sleep and i couldnt the whole
thing just-haunts me and then i
heard something outside and i listened

-and i was so scared i didnt seem
able to move not even to reach for
my gun and then this door was
pushed open and-i screamed but he
couldnt get through it like anybody else
could he wds too-big he blocked
the whole doorway and then you hol-
lered and he backed out and i heard
him running oh she shuddered
its-horrible he-might have killed

me like he-

  hes crazy spider muttered
burney wouldnt hurt anybody in his
right mind

  that dont help any she retorted
sharply oh hes-horrible

  she broken down then completely
she sat crouching in the wagon just
inside the narrow doorway and sobbed
hysterically her arms folded upon the
doorsill outside spider tried to calm
her with a diffident pat now and then
on her heaving shoulders and with
muttered imprecations and sympathy
strangely intermingled

  it was too dark to get out after the
marauder in that faint light which
the stars gave it was too dark to see
anything clearly from where he stood
beside the wagon door the ridge from
which he had run was a vague blotch
against the horizon shelton he did
not see or hear anywhere at first that
did not mean anything to him he had
forgotten shelton in his fear for the
girl and in the reaction from his fright
when he did remember he expected
momentarily to see him appear out of
the dark when he did not come and
vidas sobs had lessened to quiet weep-
ing spider called to him he waited
called again and whistled

  he turned to the girl and laid his
hand on her arm say shep was back
there with me he told her uneasily
we both started running when we
heard you holler and he aint showed
up yet i guess i better go back and
see whats wrong and he added
more uneasily i guess you better go
the spook hills mystery



along with me i dont like to leave
you here

  vida seemed at first not to hear him
but soon she got up and went back
into the vague interior of the wagon
in a minute she returned with her hat
and a mans coat-her fathers prob-
ably-which she was buttoning when
she came to the door in one hand she
held her six-shooter she let spider
help her down and she closed the door
carefully she was crying still in a
subdued tired way that went straight
to the big soft heart of spider he
took her by the arm and led her slowly
back toward the ridge

  yuh dont want to feel so about it
he said bashfully a mans got to go
when his times called and as for you
-why i reckon well take mighty good
care you dont get hurt anyway well
round burney up to-morrow he cant
git away hes so ungodly big he cant
beat it outa the country and hide any-
wheres in town no more than an ele-
phant could hide in a cabbage patch
and if he stays in these hills well git
him

  i know it she assented apologet-
ically i aint a coward either i
could kill him myself if i had a chance
i-i guess it was just nerves i dont
cry very often if i cried every time
i was unhappy she said impatiently
i wouldnt have time for anything else
but-i did get an awful scare i-i
thought i was alone except for the
herder over there with his sheep and
i knew he wouldnt hear anything
theyre bedded down out there on the
flat where nothing cant sneak up on
em so easy after this so i-i-

  i know id oughta told you we
was going to hang around close but
i was afraid maybe you wouldnt like
it i wasnt so awful much acquainted
and i didnt know-

  at that they came upon shelton ly-
ing just as he had fallen face down
in the sage with lighted matches

spider saw what had happened he
had struck his head on a rock and he
was stunned how badly they had no
means of knowing

  between them they carried him to the
wagon and got him inside by the light
of a lantern they bathed and bandaged
the purple lump and laid him out com-
fortably on vidas bed after that they
sat and talked and waited for the sun

chapter xi

  shelton came to himself in a little
while went through the common stages
of mental confusion and groped his
way back to clear thinking by sun-
rise he was master of his muscles to
the extent that he insisted upon crawl-
ing out of the wagon and helping spi-
der look for tracks but he owned
finally to a roaring headache and even
admitted that he felt groggy he
was therefore persuaded to stay at the
wagon while vida and spider went
forth upon the man trail vengefully
determined not to be fooled by any
cunning stratagem ready to kill even
if they were brought face to face with
burney they were armed-spider
with an old shotgun which vida lent
him and his own forty-five and vida
with her revolver and the little twenty-
two that seemed ridiculously inadequate
in a fight with a giant like burney arid
they were armed also with the fine
courage that had been born of sturdy
pioneer stock and nurtured by the life
each one had lived

  tracks they found the great tell-
tale footprints of a giants boots mark-
ing the length of a giants stride
spiders eyes clouded anew when he dis-
covered them in the sandy soil for he
had liked burney well-and burney
was his boss he had eaten at the
same table with burney had slept under
the same tent had used tobacco from
the same sack with that democratic
freedom which is the true essence of


the popular magazine

the western type he had watched
over burneys cattle with burneys
money he had paid for the clothes he
wore he was proud of burneys im-
mensity of frame of his tremendous
strength of his fairness and the quiet
masterfulness of his manner big in
every way he had believed burney to
be too big certainly for petty crime
or foul murder so big that he did not
need to defend himself or his rights
with the weapons of ordinary men
burney in the two or three years that
spider had known him never had
owned or carried a gun he never
hunted animals for pleasure or profit-
and for men he did not need one that
was why he killed with his hands-if
he killed at all

  he went forward grimly enough upon
the trail did spider but he went with
a great bitterness in his jieart he
would kill burney if he came close
enough but he would sorrow always
over the memory of burneys fall

  the trail wound here and there
through the sage and there were timeis
when they lost it altogether but the
general trend of the tracks was toward
the hills-rather toward the highest
roughest peak of the hills-so that
spider heading for the logical route
into the heart of its deep-scarred canons
picked up the trail twice after several
minutes of traveling by guess over
rocky ground

  vida kept beside him or close be-
hind she seemed tireless as he yet
her face was drawn and colorless from
worry and lack of sleep and food for
the breakfast that she cooked hastily
for the two men she left untouched her-
self except for a few sips of black
coffee spider tried to save her
strength for her since she seemed to
have no care for herself but she
would not have it so if he sat down
to rest after a sharp climb vida went
on ahead-which brought spider some
fearful moments and made him hurry

after her once he remonstrated with
her for hurrying too fast her answer
then was characteristic

  when i hear a rattler she said i
never quit till i find him and kill him
im scared of snakes and im scared
of that great big beast of a burney-
and i wont take a long breath till i
catch him while hes free and i dont
know where he is im-i just expect
every minute hell sneak up and grab
me

  not while i can stand on my two
feet spider interjected repressing a
shiver of horror at the thought only
i dont want you going on ahead and
youve got to save yourself too were
a long ways from camp a-ready i
wish wed brought the horses

  nyou dont either she contradicted
flatly you knew hed take to the
hills where we couldnt ride being
afoot hed be sure to pick the rough-
est going he could find and-it looks
like were up against it right now

  this because they came to a stand
before a bare cliff which shut off the
small box canon which they had en-
tered at its mouth led on by two of
the tracks they were following these
they had found in the loose sand of a
dry channel leading up the canon the
canon walls had been high overhang-
ing ledges of rock unbroken save where
slides had ripped off great sections here
and there and left the spaces unclimba-
ble because of the banks of shale the
hills were full of such canons and some-
times they were passable at the head
and gave access either to a higher pla-
teau or to other canons leading on into
the hills here however the head was
cut straight across with a cliff

  maybe burney could get up there
spider said dubiously eying the nar-
row ledge two feet above his highest
reach but i cant and you cant
unless theres some other way outa
here were done for the present

  vida searched the cliff from wall to
the spook hills mystery



wall she stood back and stared up
at the ledge and puzzled over some
means of getting up she gave up after
a little and consented to go back-
at least as far as the canons mouth
perhaps by following the top of the
canon to its head they might pick up
the trail beyond they decided

  they went back climbed laboriously
up the bluff which became the right
wall of the canon and went on the
way was rough-so rough that spider
began to feel more and more uneasy on
account of vida but until they reached
the point where they could look down
the cliff that had halted them in the
canon below she had been deaf to his
arguments then she saw how fruit-
less the search was like the black
canon they had reached the night be-
fore they faced the fact that burney
might be an impassable mile or two
away-absolutely safe from their most
eager pursuit-or he might be hiding
almost within the reach of his long
arm from them

  certainly he was safe so far as their
presence in the hills might be termed
a menace they rested a while-spider
taking care that they were not exposed
to any sudden onslaught-and then they
went dispiritedly down to where the
land rolled gently out to the arid plains
where her fathers sheep had foraged
among the sage for the grass which
the winter snows and spring rains had
coaxed into growing there

  when they could look down over the
slopes to where the dead man lay still
under his canvas covering spiders
sharp eyes saw movement there the
moving about of various black objects
he knew to - be men and horses it
might be fellows whom spooky and
jim had brought or sent it might as
easily be the coroner whom vida said
one of their herders had gone after
whichever it was they turned that way
ancb hurried down a long sloping ridge
that would bring them to the camp

  well they came to the gruesome spot
and they recognized spooky and jim
among the group spider after a min-
ute of fast walking recognized others
also bell the sheriff and also the cor-
oner whose name was walters and
there were men whom he had prob-
ably brought with him to make up a
jury spider knew most of them hav-
ing lived in that country for more than
two years

  but there was one at sight of whom
vida gave a suppressed scream and
gripped spider by the arm burney
-huge quiescent towering above the
others with the patient inaction of a
great newfoundland dog in the midst
of a pack of terriers he was not
handcuffed nor under any apparent re-
straint and at that spider wondered

  vida hung back for the first time
afraid to face the situation but spi-
der reassured her with a sentence or
two and she went reluctantly up to the
group and sidled close to her father

  spider went straight to the sheriff
a broad-shouldered red-faced man with
a bull neck who stood a little to one
side filling an age-blackened pipe tjie
sheriff glanced up at him from under
bis black hat brim nodded a greeting
and looked sidelong toward the giant
spider looked also

  where did you git burney he
asked in an undertone and then i
should think youd wrant to chain him
up instead of leaving him loose

  the sheriff made two attempts to
jight a match on his lifted leg got it
going at last and cuddled the flame
in his pipe bowl i didnt git him
he said when he was through burney
got me the fellow williams sent in
caught the night train to pocatello-
i was down there on business he was
hunting around for me and burney
happened to hear about it so burney
come and told me about it we got
the pticlars from the man and bur-
ney he come on up with us seems


the cpocpulacr magazine

williams accuses burney-but youve
gotta show me he jerked his head
backward toward the coroner its
up to him he said hell likely be
able to place the time of the murder
but if it was yesterday burneys got a
gilt-edged alibi he was in pocatello

all day-

  sure spider plucked bell by the
arm and drew him farther away
last night he stated deliberately
burney came to the wagon where miss
williams was and tried to git in she
saw him at the door and screamed and
i heard her and run up burney beat

it when he heard me running-

  bell had been shaking his beefy head
throughout the speech now he began
to tap spider impressively on the chest
with his forefinger burney was with
me last night in pocatello he said
we caught the early train to corona
together it wasnt him

  but we saw his tracks spider in-
sisted bewilderedly we tracked him
up into the hills and earlier in the
evening i seen him myself for a min-
ute-

  oh piffle exclaimed the sheriff im-
patiently man i seen him from nine
oclock till now he put his pipe back
into his mouth sucked hard on it for
a few breaths and then grinned wryly
they say youve got a spook out here
in the hills he said maybe thats
what yuh seen you sure didnt see
burney theys a dozen men-yes a
hundred -thatll swear to that bur-
ney aint a man thats easy mistook
no youre right he aint spider
agreed and went away and sat down
on a rock and rested his elbows on his
spread knees and stared hard at the
ground he wanted to think the thing
out and he was too bewildered to think
as he had told shelton before not one
single solitary fact seemed to fit in with
any other fact the things you know
for a fact are plumb impossible he
muttered to himself while he made him-

  self a smoke he glanced up at the
stark frowning hills above them i
guess it must be spooks all right he
added and that was as far toward a
solution as spider could go

chapter xii

  vida sidled around burney at a dis-
tance of two rods and so came up
to spider she was shaking with nerv-
ousness and she was white and full
of wrath

  what are those men thinking of
she demanded resentfully why dont
they fix burney so he cant git away
poppy says he aint even under arrest
spider lifted his head i know he
aint the things all balled up and
there dont nobody know where theyre
at burney come up from pocatello
this morning with the sheriff he was
there yesterday and las night the
sheriff says burney hunted him up and
come along with him

  but howt could he he was trying
to git in the wagon last night i seen
him-and id swear to that on a stack
of bibles ten feet high how could
he be in pocatello when he was here
search me said spider glumly
what are they fooling around about
doing nothing vida sat down beside
him and watched the group as though
they were all her enemies

  gitting ready for the inquest i
guess thats the corner monkeying
around the body now and all them
other fellows are the jury you and
me and your dad and the herderll have
to testify i reckon maybe theyll want
shep too-but i guess they can git
along without him theres spooky and
jim-theyll make out enough

  i wish to goodness theyd get busy
said vida peevishly ill break loose
and scream if somebody dont do some-
thing pretty quick say even yet i cant
realize it its just like a nightmare
the spook hills mystery


i cant make myself believe its uncle
jake under that tarp-

  you dont have to just slide
through this deal as easy as you can
-if you want my advice its pretty
tough at that i cant believe it either
i cant believe burney would stand
there like that with his hands in his
pockets if he-done it

  nobody else could do it vida
pointed out insistently and it was
done all right enough	f

  the coroner raised himself from
where he had been kneeling beckoned
to the sheriff and conferred with him
briefly informal though it was the
inquest that followed had an atmosphere
of grim dignity that served to comfort
vida and reassure her as nothing else
had done the law had taken charge
of the matter she drew a long breath
and lifted her shoulders as if the weight
of responsibility had been a tangible
burden the sheriff and the coroner
and all those other men-they would
deal with burney as he reserved she
no longer felt that hot desire to shoot
him down into a heap of inert flesh
like her uncle though he stood free
a little apart from the others with his
pipe in his mouth and his great hands
in his pockets he was still in the grip
of the law the sheriff would not let
him get away he would shoot him
first

  and then as the inquest proceeded
and her father testified and pete and
spooky and spider and jim vida be-
gan to feel a vague discomfort the
jury went solemnly down into the lit-
tle gully to look at the tracks burney
had left and returned a nonplused
group of men there were tracks
enough but there were no tracks that
could possibly have been made by bur-
neys feet vida could- not understand
that and then the sheriff was sworn
just like any common man and de-
clared that burney had been in poca-
tello when the murder was committed

vida could not understand that either
her father told of the sheep that had
been killed and of burneys visit on the
morning when he had ordered them off
the range but that did not offset the
sheriffs amazing statement nor the mys-
tery of the tracks that had disappeared

  there was a minute or two of whis-
pered consultation and a question which
the foreman asked the coroner concern-
ing the manner of death

  i find replied the coroner that
the deceased undoubtedly came to his
death by having his neck broken by
twisting four ribs were broken also
evidently by crushing there are no
bullet wounds-the only other marks
of violence on the body being some
scratches on the scalp behind the ear
these i judge were made by finger
nails in gripping the head to twist it

  vida shivered and then came the
most amazing thing of all in her
opinion the jury whispered and gave
their verdict and the verdict was that
her uncle jake had met death at the
hands of some person unknown to them
-with aleck burney standing there
within twenty feet of them his great
murderous hands hidden ui his pockets

  she sprang to her feet to denounce
them all as cowards and fools and liars
but when she stood up and had gone

as far as oh you- things went

black and the whole scene was blotted
out of existence as far as she was con-
cerned

  when she came to herself again she
was on her bed in the sheep wagon
with a wet towel wadded on her fore-
head and trickling water down her neck
her father was scorching the bacon out-
side and the coroner was talking to
him about free wool

  vida lay there trying to piece things
together and trying also to muster
enough energy to call to poppy that
the bacon was burning but neither
seemed worth any effort so presently
she went to sleep

               sv

  when she awoke it was night and a
cool wind was stirring the sage and
flapping a loose bit of canvas in the
doorway she did not know where her
father was but she supposed he was
asleep under the wagon where he made
up his bed always when they were to-
gether she wondered if they had
buried uncle jake--or would they have
a funeral to-morrow not much of a
funeral with no coffin and no preacher
or anything how could burney be
in pocatello when he was here in the
hills  how could he make tracks where
he hadnt been

  she went to sleep again and dreamed
that she was tracking burney and that
the tracks came and went in the sand
without any human aid or explanation
then she dreamed that she was in a
blind canon with no way out except
through the mouth where she had en-
tered she had gone in there looking
for burney but her dream shifted as
dreams have a fashion of doing burney
was looking for her and she was hiding
in there and she saw him creeping up
the canon a gigantic figure in the deep
shadows of the high walls and sud-
denly there was no place to hide and
burney was coming closer and closer
peering this way and that with his little
deep-set twinkling eyes he had not
yet discovered her where she cowered
against the bare wall of the canon but
he would see her presently he was
so close that she could hear his foot-
steps crunching--

  the wagon tilted six inches upheaved
from below and woke vida she found
herself sitting up on the hard bunk and
her heart was not beating at all then
it gave a heavy flop at the base of her
neck she screamed automatically
without any conscious volition shrilly
without any articulateness

  the wagon heaved again so that she
clung to the boarded edge of the bunk
like a rabbit scared out of its hiding
she darted suddenly away from the bed

and down the lurching length of the
wagon box to the narrow doorway
jerked the door open and looked out
she knew then what it was she feared
and she knew that she was afraid for
her father whose bed was always made
up under the wagon and who slept heav-
ily as tired slow-thinking men do sleep
when their lives are spent in the open
the wagon settled down suddenly on
its four wheels there was a scurry-
ing rush of some large object-but it
was behind the wagon where vida
could not see because of the canvas
top she did not know where her gun
had been put

  poppy she called in a perfect
frenzy of terror poppy where are
you poppy oh poppy

  from behind fhe wagon-out in the
whispering sage a hoarse scream an-
swered her human-and yet not hu-
man-mocking maniacal horrible the
most awful sound that vida had ever
heard in her life a squall a cry-a
shriek she could not find a name for
her memory flew back to the tales of
ghosts and demons that an old scotch
woman had told her years ago war-
lock-that was it a warlock such
as maggie macdonald had told about
that haunted the heath behind the vil-
lage where strange deaths occurred pe-
riodically in the dark of the moon
when men and women were found
strangled-and none knew how or why

  vida crouched down in the wagon
box back in the shadow where the
moon-a little later in its dip behind the
high peak to-night-could not betray
her to the devil that roamed without
she had laughed at those old tales of the
warlock-except when she shivered
over the actual telling but now to-
night the thing seemed real-a tangible
menace she felt its uncanny presence
bounding away over the sage a horrible
thing blue with horns and a long tail
taking what shape it would leaving
the spook hills mystery



what trail it would for men to puzzle
their wits over

  she hid her face in her circling arms
and shivered she saw now why it was
that burney had seemed to be in two
places at once why it was that shelton
and spider and spooky had felt some
eerie thing following them they might
have been killed no one was safe
from a warlock no one

  she could not have spent more than
a minute crouching there in the grip of
superstitious fear but it seemed to her
that she must have cowered in that cor-
ner against the grub box at least an
hour she heard a stir beneath the
wagon a sound between a grunt and a
groan

  poppy she cried again and lifted
her head what was it poppy are
you hurt the sound of her own
voice steadied her wonderfully she
went back and in the dim light of the
moon shining faintly on the canvas
groped with her fingers along a rough
shelf over the bed where she thought
her father might have laid her revolver
her hand struck against the cool barrel
of it she caught it up eagerly and
went hurrying back to the door that was
open and swung slowly back and forth
in the breeze like the pendulum of a
clock almost run down for lack of wind-
ing she climbed down over the front
of the wagon box-if you are familiar
with sheep wagons you know that they
are not very convenient as to getting in
and out-and crept between the front
wheels where her father always put the
head of his bed

  it was dark there and the moon had
set a black shadow of the wagon top
down upon the eastern side vida
groped with one hand-the other held
her revolver poppy why dont you
answer me  where are you  she
called sharply

  the vague outline of his squat figure
detached itself from the shadow of the
wagon and he stood plainly revealed in

the moonlight  f i could git a sight
of im id shoot em down like i would
a ki-oty he snarled where be yuh
vida tore m shirt half offn me
tryin to git his hands on m throat all
saved me was the bigness of him he
got hung up between the wagon wheels
and he didnt know jest how i was
layin f id a had m bed outn the
open hed a killed me sure man like
thatd oughta be hung up by the heels
-over a slow fire killins too good fr
im dyou hearm holler vida tried
to sound like a mountn lion sos to fool
me-but it didnt work worth a cent
he cant fool me i seen him when he
raised up n turned tail n run i seen
im plain as day

  and was it-burney poppy vida
had crawled back from under the
wagon and the two stood together just
within the shadow staring off into the
moonlit whispering sage which the
breeze moved so that it seemed alive

  a-course it was burney he cant
fool me he got out in the moonlight
fr a minute and i seen him plainer n
what i see you a-course it was bur-
ney hes a cute one-purtendint be
in pocatello n at home n every-
wheres but where he is but he cant
fool me he aint cute enough he
crawled out n stood up in the moon-
light f id a had m gun in m hands
then id a fixed him tried t murder
me in m sleep he woulda too f he
hadnt a been so all-fired big he
couldnt git under the wagon

  away off on the flat where the sheep
were bedded down in the care of a
herder a dog barked hysterically in the
sharp staccato of alarm yelped once
and was still a few mother sheep
blatted and a man yelled some shrill
command yelled just once and did not
yell again vida shuddered and clung
to her father

  ill bet he went over there among
the sheep she whispered terrifiedly
then she took a fresh grip on her cour-

age and her gun and started to run to-
ward the disturbance she had forgot-
ten her conviction that a warlock was
abroad working his will upon defense-
less humans

  coine on poppy she called back
at the man who still hesitated and
grumbled threats in the shadow of the
wagon come on and help me get
him big ashe is a bulletll stop him-
come on

  you crn on back here cried her
father with futile authority in his voice
and stayed where he was cm on
back you cant do nothin in the dark
that-a-way

  he might be killing wait smith
vida flung the sentence back at him
and ran the faster but her father
stayed by the wagon and shouted com-
mands and imprecations after her as
she ran

  she topped the last low ridge that
marked the edge of the sage-covered
flat where the sheep had been held for
safety and stood still for a minute
panting heavily and trying to see what
was taking place out there where the
band was huddled the moon silvered
softly the plain she could see as far
as pillar butte even-a vague dark
blur against the star-sprinkled purple
which was the sky then quite sud-
denly the moonlight darkened so that
she could not see ten rods she turned
to see why and a streak of vivid yellow
gashed the night through like a flaming
sword

  a thunderstorm common enough in
that country was sweeping up from
the southwest already it had swal-
lowed the moon so deeply that vida
staring upward could not even see
where it had gone and while she stared
with her face turned upward she heard
a cry down there below her on the plain
a mans cry for help it was not so very
far away either she swung instantly
and faced that way and wished for the

lightning that would cut away the dark-
ness

  this way come this way she
called as loudly as she could and with
her thumb pulled back the hammer of
her gun it was walt smith the tow-
headed mormon herder he was run-
ning-she could hear him rustling the
sage bushes that came in his way

 and then the lightning came-a
bright opening in the clouds like a black
velvet curtain drawn aside suddenly to
give a glimpse of the brilliance behind
the whole plain was lighted more
clearly than by the moon and vida
standing there with the lightning be-
hind her saw walt smith running to-
ward her like a scurrying rabbit toward
its burrow saw behind him the huge
figure of a man who came on with giant
strides leaping clean over what bushes
came in his way

  the darkness dropped and made the
night blacker after the glare so that she
could see nothing the heavy roll of
thunder beat down whatever cry might
have come from the quarry but the
lightning came again-and walt was
close-so close that she could see he had
no hat on and that his tow hair was
bushy with the wind he faced and that
giant who came behind-he was close
too quite close in a minute he would
overtake walt

  involuntarily vida raised her hand
and fired straight at his middle the
big man swerved sharply and she fired
again and yet again she saw him
whirl and start back-and then it was
black dark again walt smith came
puffing up the slope and vida waited
for him a little contemptuous she
was-a little impatient because men ran
from burney instead of shooting as she
had done walt had a gun-why didnt
he use it instead of running like a scared
rabbit burney would not have come
after him if walt had used his gun
rather than his legs she was begin-
ning to understand that burney was
the spook hills mystery



afraid of a gun a gun was the only
thing more powerful more dangerous
than he was he could not fight and
overcome a bullet he could not catch
it on its singing flight and twist the
neck of it and kill it burney was afraid
of a gun and vida once she felt that
it was so lost all her fear of him

  so her lips curled in the darkness
while walt came panting up to where
she stood and told breathlessly how
burney had got among the sheep and
how a dog had run out and burney had
killed the dog how he had shouted
for the other dog that was off chasing
a coyote from the far side of the band
and how burney had then come at him
like a charging elephant

 and you didnt have sense enough
to shoot she finished for him coldly
you and poppy make me tired ill
bet you dropped your gun when you
started to run

  no i never walt hastened to
deny i kep it-but i never had no
chancet to use it he--he was cornin
right at me

chapter xiii

  vida made her way in the face of the
freshening wind to where her father
stood guard over the empty sheep wagon
and waited impatiently her return be-
hind her tagged walt smith puffing and
pasty-white from the scare he had
gotten

  poppy either you or walt will have
to go and stay with the sheep she an-
nounced firmly when she came near
and the lightning split the darkness and
revealed him to her burney killed
one of the dogs-but you neednt be
scared either one of you i put him on
the run shooting at him he wont
bother again to-night-he never has
after he has been shot at

  he oughta be killed snarled her
father ineffectively a man thatll
murder-

  you can suit yourself which one
goes back to the sheep its going to
storm pretty quick-and storm hard
too ive got to git me something to
eat and rest up im about done up as
it is she started to climb up into the
wagon but stopped in the doorway and
turned toward the two wheres the
sheriff at she asked and whats he
going to do about burney

  i aint runnin the sheriff her fa-
ther retorted with the petulance of the
weak-souled how shd i know where
hes at went back to town with the
corner i guess after we buried jake
he couldnt do nothing about burney-
not after the corners jury let him off
sheriff cant run a man in without a
warrant he explained in the tone of
weary tolerance for a womans igno-
rance which some men love to assume
he didnt have no warrant yuh got
to git something on burney fore he cn
be rested

  yes and hed run loose a good long
while before you ever done anything
about it-but talk she accused bit-
terly  n it was your own brother
too and your sheep walt smith
you git back there and look after em
what you gitting paid for you neednt
be scared-a burney all you gotta do
is shoot if he shows up and hell run
you seen how quick he headed the other
way when i shot he wont show up
though hes halfways home by this
time

  she waited until she saw walt turn
reluctantly and go off toward the sheep
she upbraided her father again for his
weak passivity that spent precious min-
utes in useless clamor and told him to
keep watch while she slept in the
morning she declared she meant to get
out after burney herself seeing no one
else had the nerve to do it

  when she had made her feelings and
her intentions perfectly clear to him-
and thereby claimed and clarified her
own mind-she ate hungrily of cold
	the popular magazine

fried bacon and some very good bread
which she herself had baked and fin-
ished with a dish of stewed dried ap-
ples and a cup of cold tea

  after that she lay down upon her
hard bed with her six-shooter cuddled
under her pillow and her fingers touch-
ing the cool butt of it and listened to
the grumbling mutter of the storm and
watched the searing lightning flash in-
termittent glares of light upon her
bowed canvas roof

  she fell asleep so for she was
young and healthy and sturdy of spirit
and she had seen burney the giantturn
and run from her and her gun-and she
had lost her fear of him

  the rain came suddenly and pelted
the sageland with great globes of cold
water hurled earthward sheets of it
like a gray wall with the gashing sword-
thrusts of the lightning and the splitting
crash of thunder-and still she slept
all her life she had known those ter-
rific thunderstorms of the plains coun-
try and the shelter of that twelve-ounce
canvas over her head spelled security
to her nerves

  her father pottered peevishly about
piling harness and saddles under the
wagon and lifting his blankets up under
the canvas top lie muttered queru-
lously to himself at the vileness of fate
and the passionate fury of the storm
while he spread his bed upon the floor
between the stove and the hinged table
and with a grunt laid himself down at
last for his belated rest and vida slept
quietly heavily utterly worn out and
gathering strength for what was to
come

  in the morning came shelton and spi-
der to see how she had fared and to
learn whether they had seen or heard
anything of the murderer of her uncle
that at least was their professed er-
rand probably they merely made that
an excuse for riding over

  spider had been made a deputy be-
fore the sheriff left so that he might

feel behind him the authority of the
law in ease an emergency rose the
sheriff he explained to vida apologeti-
cally would have stayed and hunted the
hills over-if he had known who or
what he was to search for

  hes plumb up aginst a mystery
spider asserted and lie aint got the
time to turn out and play detective
shep and mes going to try our hands
at that and if we get anything that
looks like a clew were to let him know
you see since burneys proved he never

done it-

  thatll take a lot more proof than
hes furnished yet vida cut in stub-
bornly he tried to kill poppy last
night but he got hung up trying to get
under the wagon he tore poppys shirt
and then he run and he went down
to the band and killed a dog and tried

to kill walt smith but-

  how do you know spider moved
closer and his eyes were sharpened
while he stared into her face how
do you know it was burney

  because i seen him and poppy seen
him i seen him chasing walt and i
took a couple of shots at him he
turned and run then like a scared rab-
bit

  youre sure it was burney spi-
der still stared hard at her

  of course im sure do you think
hes easy to mistake he wasnt moren
fifty yards away when the lightning lit
up everything and i shot at him he
was as plain as you are this minute
what time was that it started in

to lightning about half past ten-

  and it was the first bright flash that
showed him up it was moonlight till
then and then the storm rolled up in
front of the moon poppy seen him by
moonlight-

  spider turned and looked inquiringly
at shelton you know what time bur-
ney came home lie said

  then he was gone last night vida
stood up quivering for the hunt till
the spook hills mystery



then she may have had a subconscious
doubt of burneys guilt in spite of the
evidence of her eyes

  he was gone stated shelton mysti-
fiedly but he came back just after the
storm started spider and i were going
to follow and see where he went but
we didnt miss him till just before the
storm came up because hed left a can-
dle burning after wed all gone to bed
spider got up and looked and the light
was out and we went down and found
out that his horse was gone-and that
was just when it begun to thunder and
lightning and we were going to sad-
dle up and come over here anyway
when it started to rain like all get-cut
we were waiting for it to let up a little
when burney came back we saw him
ride down the hill-it was lightning
something fierce by that time-and we
beat it back to the bunk house before
he came up we didnt want him to
know we were watching him you see
shelton had still a purple-and-green
lump on his forehead but he was other-
wise his old cheerful self

  you dont know how long hed been
gone  vida was plainly puzzled this
might prove another alibi

  not more than an hour or two be-
cause i made an excuse to go to the
cabin just about nine oclock and bur-
ney was in bed then reading a novel by
candlelight hed acted pretty gloomy
-didnt he spider-after we all got
home didnt eat any supper but sat
and smoked and looked at his toes as if
he were thinking pretty hard about
something so when i saw him read-
ing in bed spider and i kind of made
up our minds that he had settled down
for the night so we went to bed we
meant to put in the day looking around
whether burney liked it or not and
then spider saw the light go out and
got up to make sure-and burney was
gone so-

  how about the other fellows
vida was putting bacon sandwiches in

a flour sack with the evident intention
of spending the day in the hills

  oh they claim that burney dont
know a thing about the-killing
theyre off riding the other way to-
day spider took it upon himself to
explain im supposed to be too i
just pulled out with shep and never
said a word to anybody im liable to
git my time-but thatll be all right
theres other jobs i might herd sheep
for a change he said with a twinkle in
his eyes

  well if youre going into the hills
im going with you vida announced
decisively i aint afraid of burney
any more and-she gritted her teeth
over the thought-id just like to have
a hand in rounding him up i aint
afraid of him ive found out that a
gun is bigger than he is-and he knows
it and i can shoot just as well as
either of you sotm going

  itll be pretty hot spider objected
weakly and its rough going too-
where were going

  it wont be any hotter in the hills
than it will be in this wagon vida ar-
gued and i was raised on rough
going

  well wed like to have you with us
all right-spider flushed over the ad-
mission which to him sounded ex-
tremely significant-but we aint going
after burney exactly we dont know
what were going after that spook
maybe put it any way you like miss
williams its a cinch burney never
killed your uncle he couldnt when
he was in pocatello all that day

  the sheriff lied maybe vida had
a streak of stubbornness that was slow
to yield

  no he never and there was the
coroner too he seen burney in poca-
tello and talked with him and they was
together him and the sheriff was both
down there from shoshone and your
herder went there after em stead of
waiting at corona till they come up


the cpocpulflcr magazine

hll tell you himself he seen burney
in pocatello no we got to look for
some one else thats hiding out in these
hills

  theres last night too shelton
pointed out to her how do you sup-
pose burney could ride twelve or fif-
teen miles in less than an hour this
was secondhand wisdom which he had
picked up from spiders deductions on
the way over

  how could there be another man
the size of burney in the country and
nobody know it vida came back at
him tracks and everything prove-
and besides didnt i tell you i seen
him 

  at night said spider patiently
always at night why i could strap
a pair of stilts onto my legs and fix to
look like burney-at night lord he
ejaculated i believe ive fell onto the
answer to the whole blame thing

  vida looked at him with her lips
parted inwardly she was seeing how
plausible that solution was after all
she herself had gone striding over this
very country on crude homemade stilts
just for fun when she was a child
still-

  how would stilts make a man so-
strong in his hands she questioned
with a catch in her voice over the horror
her words called up

  theres tricks to help a man seem a
whole lot strongern what he is spi-
der told her with something approach-
ing cheerfulness theres somebody
prowling around these hills trying to
git something onto burney he de-
clared boldly why itd be a cinch
the way hes worked it-only h cant
be in two places at once and he cant
watch burney and do his dirty work all
at the same time so burney slips alibis
over on him now and then and that
kinda spoils his play come on folks
-well see what we can figure out on
this trail anyway ill bet money ive
got the answer right here-that its just

a common-sized man we want to look
for that hates burney and wtants to get
him in bad

  but whod want to vida persisted
in her doubts it would take a man
half crazy with hate to think up a
scheme like killing sheep and-folks-
that way and making big tracks around

over the country- she brought the

package of sandwiches and gave it to
spider that would take the worst
kind of an enemy to do that

  well it dont take much to start
some men loping along the hate trail
spider asserted confidently lots of
men hate burney hes so ungodly big
hes got a cinch in everything but a gun
fight and hes kinda queer in his ways
all right he dont mix with folks and
he dont try to make friends with no-
body sb he aint got so awful many
well ill go git rour pony and well
drift-if youre bound to come with us
poppys going to be out with the
sheep all day and thats where i draw
the line-at sheep-herding ill feel lots
safer with you boys

  that of course settled any lingering
reluctance to take her with them she
mounted the pinto pony which spider
saddled and led up to her and they rode
toward the hills there was no en-
couragement to look for tracks after
that heavy pelting rain they loped
along in silence for the most part until
they reached the first real climb and
were compelled to go slowly

  vida was studying the mystery from
the new angle which spider had taken
with his theory for that matter so
was shelton and spider himself spi-
der pulled a foot free of the stirrup
slid over in the saddle so that he was
resting mostly on one thigh for relaxa-
tion and sifted tobacco into a ciga-
rette paper

  yes sir that accounts for pretty
nearly everything he said apropos of
their thoughts if we can locate that
cave that shep went prognosticating
the spook hills mystery

      



around in ill bet you money well nab
the gentleman thats been doing all the
mischief chances are thats where he
hangs out and between you and me
ive got a notion i could name the man
i wont because i aint dead sure and
its a nasty proposition tacking a crime
like that on a fellow till youre dead
certain he done it but theres one fel-
low and only one that might frame
up a deal like this and put it through
hes strong as a bull pretty middling
big and he hates burney worsen a
schoolmaam hates a worm down her
back hes on the dodge for a killing
he done in hailey a year ago last win-
ter it was burneys evidence that put
the diamond hitch on him-and he broke
jail and aint been seen since he left
word hed git burney and git him
right

  would he be afraid of a gun
vida put the question qu seriously

  the twinkling devil showed in spi-
ders eyes when he looked at her

  my experience is that most any man
is afraid of a gun when he aint behind
it he informed her dryly every-
body knows that burney never packs
a gun so he couldnt very well produce
one and go on acting the part of bur-
ney-sabe and he wouldnt be crazy
about being shot either it would be
up to him to drift unless he wranted to
give the whole deal away

  is he in this country shelton
studied the hills before them with that
frank curiosity which was almost
childish

  if hes the man he sure must be in
this country i dont hardly think hes
in south america ask another one
shep

  shelton flushed glanced quickly at
vida and refrained from asking an-
other question

  they worked their way up the more
open slopes until they were in the heart
of spook hills all about them the
steeps rose sbeer above canons whose

roughness was hidden beneath the deep
green of pines mottled along the middle
with the lighter foliage of cottonwoods
that told where flowed the tiny streams
which never reached the desert beyond

  its a great place to hide out in
spider observed once when they stopped
on a high bare ridge and gazed out over
the jumble and its an almighty poor
place to find anybody in its just a
case of ridin by guess and by gosh
and taking a chance on runnin acrost
anything

  what about the cave arent you
going to hunt around there vida
asked him somewhat diffidently she
might bully shelton and assert her
wider experience and laugh at his ig-
norance and she might-and did-or-
der her father about like a hired man
but with spider she was all woman who
recognized man as the leader save
when she argued over the guilt of bur-
ney her deference to spiders mascu-
linity was perfectly noticeable

  we are if we can find it shep
he went and lost it out of his pocket
after he got through playin with it and
he aint found it again spider was
finding it easy to joke over the matter
now since he had a theory that left
burney clear of guilt

  ill bet i could find it vida de-
clared quite suddenly what kind of
a place was-it shep-on the outside
did it open out onto a rocky knoll like
that over there  she pointed with her
quirt

  no it didnt it was under a ledge
 the side of a canon it was down
east of that ridge where i left you that
day-and it went straight back like a
long tunnel and then there were
branches after one went in quite a long
way

  vida studied the hills frowningly
lots of caves are like that she re-
torted her eyes smiling across at spi-
der in a way that shelton did not find
pleasurable to himself i could show


the popular magazine

you a dqzen long tunnels that open
under ledges in canons the hills are
full of them wasnt there anything
else to remember it by

  shelton twisted his lips ruefully
several things i lost old dutch there
and had to walk home for one and i

met that old indian squaw that- by

jove he turned to spider eagerly
if we could find her-again she might
know whether theres anybody else liv-
ing here in the hills dont you think
i thought you said she was crazy
spiders enthusiasm seemed to conserve
itself for his own ideas and blind

 well-yes she was but still-

  if shes blind she couldnt see him
and if shes crazy we couldnt depend
on anything she said so whats the
use if you know any caves that might
do for a hang out vida lets take a look
at em ive got candles

  i know lots of them not on this
side though vida examined the near-
est bluffs critically well have to get
across this ridge first its just like
these hills was piled up hot and before
they got cold they crumpled all down
on one side and left lumps and hollows
all through them over on the other
side is where most all the caves are
that meant a wide detour because
they were already up so high in the hills
that the canons were not to be crossed
except afoot shelton wanted to keep
straight on but the other two did not
pay much attention to his opinions or
his wishes after all he was a tender-
foot and they two were western to the
bone and say what you wtill there is
a certain clannishness among rangefolk
a perfectly natural drawing together of
congenial spirits even wheft there is no
sex attraction to emphasize the partial-
ity shelton felt it and became moody
and rode by himself quite pointedly
which did not displease vida so far as
one could tell by her manner and which
visibly elated spider who wanted her
to himself anyway

  thus they reached again the lower
country some distance apart and in
crossing a series of low ridges became
separated shelton did not mind that
in the least in fact he had assisted the
accident by loitering behind a ridge
and in letting dutch climb at a slant that
would eventually land him in the home
trail shelton was sulking as much as
it was in his nature to sulk he had
been overlooked in the conversation he
had seen vida smile at spider as she
had never smiled at himself and he had
been laughed at when he offered sug-
gestions which he considered perfectly
good he had begun to suspect that the
quest of the murderer was after all sec-
ondary in importance to their pleasure
in riding through the hills together a
lot they cared about finding clews so
long as they could ride side by side and
make eyes at each other he criticized
sharply he was out to solve the grue-
some mystery of these hills and he
could do it a lot easier without those
two along making objections to every-
thing he wanted to do he saw a spooky-
looking gorge all jutting ledges and
deep crevices along the sides off to his
right he turned deliberately into it
in spite of the fact that it led straight
away from where he had last seen spi-
der and vida

chapter xiv

  it is not wise for a party to become
separated in the wilderness shelton
born to the easy ways of policed streets
and cars which may be counted upon
to land all wanderers at home in due
time did not know of that unwritten
law ofrhe wild which commands a man
to keep in touch with his companions
he went calmly about his own business
and felt no compunctions whatever over
the separation

  spider and vida however knew well
the law of the wild and did their best
to obey it they waited on top of the
the spook hills mystery



ridge and talked of many things after
a while they rode back where they could
scan the long bare slope they had just
climbed for shep was green and there
was no telling what might have hap-
pened they did not see anything of
him for the simple reason that he had
crossed the ridge lower down while they
stood talking hidden from him by a
straggling growth of alders they went
back to the highest point and waited
there and watched all the slopes spi-
der yelled with his cupped hands for a
megaphone to the four quarters of the
earth until he was purple

  they retraced their steps to where
they had last seen shep and from there
they tried to track him they did track
him halfway up the ridge and then lost
all trace of him in a patch of thick
short grass all matted with last years
growth they called him names re-
lieving their minds a little they told
each other over and over how blame-
less they had been and how they had
taken it for granted he would have
sense enough to follow them and not
go wandering off by himself they
went back upon the pinnacle and waited
again and watched the hills and canons
spread all about them as an eagle must
watch from his aerie they repeatedly
declared that they ought to go on and
leave him-it would serve him right and
learn him a lesson but they lingered
still held by that law of the wild that
stragglers must be accounted for before
a party may continue its journey per-
haps the law itself might not have held
them had there not been a very real
menace to wanderers in those hills
somewhere this wilderness held con-
cealed a man who would murder fiend-
ishly and wantonly they could not go
on and leave shep unaccounted for he
had started out with them and he had
given them no hint that he intended to
leave them and yet he had disap-
peared completely and without warning

  aw said spider at last when the
a

sun hung high and hot over their heads
theres no sense in waiting here any
longer hed a showed up long ago
if he was coming weve done our
share and then some weve waited
here and hunted and watched two good
long hours-and ive hollered my head
oif if that other fellows anywhere
within ten mile of us he knows just
where were located by this time lets
get on over the other side-a the moun-
tain and take a look at them caves

  but i dont see where shep could
a went to vida complained nerv-
ously i guess my nerves are all up-
set lately i know it dont take much to
worry the life outa me

  lets go back to camp spider had
suggested it four or five times hut he
tried it again in the hope that vida like
all other women would change her
mind this aint no business for a
girl anyway-tracking down a mur-
derer well go back and ill get
spooky and jim and well make a still
hunt all through here i never meant
to-

  oh i know all that but i consider
im just as good as spooky or jim
either one i can shoot-and thats
what will count if we meet him i dont
scare easy-honest i dont you
mustnt feel as if youve got me on your
hands to take care of i can take care
of myself i-killed a mountain lion
once

  i dont know of anybody id rather
have along said spider softening his
voice unconsciously youve sure got
most-a the men skinned for nerve i
never seen a woman as nervy as you
are he paused and leaned a trifle
closer  f theres anything i hate its
a coward he added guilefully all i
meant was that i aint as brave for you
as you are for yourself i dno what
id do if anything was to happen to
you

  vida was not schooled to coquetry
she blushed and looked away from him


the popular magazine

across the uneven crests of the hills
she had no pert answer ready she was
acutely conscious of his hand behind her
on the high cantle just as if he had his
arm around her she felt and she was
conscious of her own awkwardness

  why theres shep away over there
aint it she pointed a slim brown
finger its a white horse anyway-
i bet hes headed for home

  spider frowned and took away his
hand even at two or three miles dis-
tance shep could be a confounded nui-
sance it would seem and interrupt just
when he shouldnt its him all right
he conceded briefly now youll quit
worrying about him maybe what shall
we do  go back or take a look around
them caves

  i wont go back vida started her
pony forward wondering why she
should feel such a sudden depression
its awful hot lets hunt for a spring
and eat our lunch first thing well
have to go pretty near as far as shep
went to get where theres any caves that
i know anything about

  she rode part way down the ridge in
silence i just cant make myself be-
lieve it wasnt burney she broke out
abruptly a man with stilts on could
make tracks-i can see how that would

be easy enough but-

  but what spider looked at her
unsmilingly he had thought her con-
vinced she had been convinced so
far as he could see it was like a woman
to fly back on an argument and have to
go through the whole deal again
what makes it hard to believe

  vida turned in the saddle so that she
faced him her eyes held a worried
look she did want to please spider but
she was so uncompromisingly honest
that she could not pretend to believe
just because he wanted her to do so

  i hate this talking and talking and
never getting anywhere she protested
impatiently but i just cant believe
it wasnt burney he was big-not

just tall but biff he was so big he
couldnt crawl under the wagon like a
common man would to get poppy he
waked me up tilting the wagon up on
one side trying to crawl under between
the wheels our brake sticks out quite
a ways but any common man coulda
got under easy enough- it was bur-
ney i know it was when i seen him
chasing walt smith he was big-big
every way we aint after any com-
mon-sized man and i know it and he
dont live in any cave either he lives
right at the sunbeam ranch its all
foolishness hunting through all the
caves if he was there we couldnt
git him hed see us coming with our
lights

  why didnt you say you felt that
way about it spiders voice was
hard and even

  a person feels things without know-
ing it sometimes i knew all the time
i didnt feel right about it but-

  if you dont want to hunt the caves
whats the use of going on to prove
that it was of no use whatever spider
pulled his horse to a stand ill take
you back to camp and then ill have a
free hand to look where i want to look
come on-ill want a little time before
dark

  oh you neednt get mad vida told
him quickly her own eyes burning the
anger light ill go through the caves
if thats what you want but-

  i dont want you to i told you
all along i didnt it aint safe for a
girl then just because he was a bit
angry he spoiled his last chance of
sending her back if it was burney
youd be dead safe he said its be-
cause it aint him and i know it aint

  seems to me its poor policy to
know so much about who it is and who
it aint snapped vida and sent her
pony on down the hill she did not
mean anything by that except that his
positiveness irritated her at that mo-
ment
the spook hills mystery



  but spider inflamed by his anger and
made abnormally sensitive by his grow-
ing love for the girl fancied that she
was hinting at a guilty knowledge of
the crime he turned white around
the lips and nostrils and fell back a
couple of rods in the rear save for
the fact that she really was not safe in
those hills alone he would have left her
just as shelton had left her a few
days ago he compromised by keeping
her in sight and in remaining so far
behind that she must stop and wait for
him openly before there could be any
further speech between them

  vida looked back once or twice very
cautiously and saw that spider had no
intention of overtaking her she flamed
hot with anger which she tried to be-
lieve was directed toward spider rather
than herself she had been pretty
mean but so had spider if he really
believed she wasnt safe alone why did
he lag along behind like that  well
all right if he wanted to keep his dis-
tance-shed see that it was easy to do

  so she urged her pony down that
hill at a shuffling trot and when he was
at the bottom she put him into a lope
she felt hateful and she meant to act
just as hateful as she felt no sun-
beamer need think he could whistle her
to his heels he wanted to hunt
through the caves  very well she
would lead him to all the caves she
knew and he could hunt through them
to his hearts content much good it
would do him with the murderer hang-
ing out at the sunbeam ranch all the
while

  vida was a girl and she was given
to moods though she was accustomed
to hard living and to worrying over
material things-even to tragedy in a
small way-she had been stirred deeply
by the outrages upon her family she
could have killed had the opportunity
risen when she was in the killing mood
she had run the gamut of emotions in
the past forty-eight hours from fear

and horror and hate to shy dawning
love and the sense of security which
love brings to women but nerves are
tricky things at best because she be-
came quite absorbed in the tormenting
of one called spider-she did not even
know his real name-and she pushed
into the background of her mind the
real object of their quest to lead
spider through the hills to dodge into
this cave and that cave ahead of him-
always to keep ahead of him-that be-
came a matter of importance to make
him think that he had lost sight of her
permanently and to watch from some
hiding place in the rocks while he
hunted for her-that raised her spirits
immensely

  as to burney-she thought of him
sometimes in the wildest places and
sent uneasy seeking glances around her
but then she had her gun safe in its
holster at her hip and the belt sagged
with loaded cartridges and burney was
afraid of a gun so she put the un-
welcome thought of him from her and
went on teasing spider nerves are
tricky things and they take strange
whims but fate is trickier and her
whims are stranger

  fate for instance sent shelton c
sherman straight down a canon tip
which burney was riding slowly pur-
posefully saving his big horse deliber-
ately that he might get from him much
in the way of endurance if the need
came later shelton stopped a good
deal surprised at the meeting burney
stopped-perhaps surprised also though
that wras hard to determine just by look-
ing at him it was as if burney being
given the normal amount of human
emotions had to spread them out thin
to fill his great self so that they reached
the surface of his face so diluted as to
be scarcely discernible his little eyes
twinkled sharply at the young man who
was supposed to be somewhere else-
but since they always did twinkle


the cpopullcr magazine

sharply there was no especial meaning
to be read into their expression

  there was one thing queer about bur-
ney he did not ask many questions
and yet he had the knack of squeezing
one dry of information he certainly
squeezed shelton dry in the ten min-
utes they stood there talking where
he had been told truthfully and because
burneys eyes impelled the telling what
had happened at the williams camp and
what vida thought of it and her fa-
ther where he and spider and vida
had started for that morning and why
spiders theory of the man who wore
stilts and a pair of big boots fastened
on somehow to look like burneys
tracks everything in fact that shelton
c sherman knew about the whole affair
he told just because burney sat there
on his big horse and looked down at him
fixedly with an expectant look in his
little eyes as if they were always say-
ing well is that all

  shelton was not prudent of course
he should have kept some things to
himself-but he did not not one single
thing that he knew or that had been said
in his presence

  whereabouts was they headed for
when you left em burney having
gotten the whole story seemed to desire
that certain points should be made ex-
ceptionally clear

  for some caves that vida knows
they wanted to find the one i was in
when i saw the-tracks the tracks
of your boots he explained in obe-
dience to burneys sharp glance and
the big bear tracks they think maybe
theyll find some clew around there i
tried to find the cave again to show
spider and i couldnt did burney
look relieved at that we looked all
over and we couldnt find it or the
squaw i saw that said-

  said what

  said she knew your-father she
said-

  did they go straight up from wil-
liams camp

  straight as they could i left them
climbing that long ridge

  burney glanced up at the sun you
better go on home he said in his high
querulous voice you can work on
the corral so we can throw in some
stock i want the boys to bring in to the
ranch im going to see williams ill
be back in a couple of hours you can
have dinner ready when i git there
he gave shelton another sharp glance
seemed to hesitate and rode past with-
out having made up his mind

  so they separated the one going
down the canon toward the more open
country and the other going up into the
heart of the roughest part

  shelton looked back when he had
ridden a few yards he caught burney
looking back also and there was some-
thing furtive in his posture shelton
faced confusedly to the front again and
rode on but his mind was busy with the
man behind him if burney were going
to the williams camp what was he
doing riding up this canon  that
would make the way longer as well as
rougher without giving any advantage
that shelton could determine if he
were not going to the williams camp
why should he explain that he was going
there  burney was not in the habit of
volunteering information except when
it was necessary to do so it was not
necessary to account to shelton for
his riding in the hills

  a qualm of uneasiness struck shel-
ton why had burney been so par-
ticular about wanting to know just
where vida and spider were going

  what was that to burney shelton
rode a few rods farther thinking hard
he began to wish that he had not told
burney quite so much what if bur-
ney-

  a dryness came into sheltons throat
he turned impulsively and rode back
up the canon as quietly as he could and
the spook hills mystery



before him as he rode was a vision
of the scattered carcasses of dead sheep
killed mysteriously and the twisted
corpse of a man lying cold under the
stars and of vida and spider riding
together over the ridge talking together
careless of what danger they might meet
in the hills he shivered though the
day was hot

chapter xv

  vida stopped halfway up a forbid-
dingly barren gulch and looked inquir-
ingly behind her she had been riding
rather slowly since she turned into this
small canon and it seemed to her that
spider should have overtaken her ten
minutes ago she was certain that he
had seen her turn off from the larger
canon they had been following with a
good two hundred yards between them
for an hour she had plaed hide and
seek with him and in the playing had
insensibly recovered her usual calm self-
reliance the horror of the past two
days was there still but vida felt herself
perfectly able to cope with it and any
emergency that might arise from it

  she wanted to tell spider that after
all it might not be burney who had
done the murder it had occurred to
her that a man with stilts strapped on
his legs would find it awkward to crawl
under a wagon in the dark-and any
strong man heaving up with his bent
back could tilt their camp wagon she
realized now that the imagination is
prone to play tricks upon a person
whose nerves are strained to the snap-
ping point believing the marauder to
be burney she would of course imag-
ine that it was burney whom she saw
given the height the rest would be quite
natural

  she would tell spider that and make
up with him and behave herself but
she would not ride back to meet him
-that would be too abject a surrender
he might say that she went back after

him because she was scared or because
her conscience hurt her and neither
would be true because her conscience
was perfectly clear of guilt she had
not run away from him really he had
simply lagged behind she forgot that
she had all but accused him of being
an accomplice of burney in the murder
of her uncle jake her conscience was
clear and she certainly was not scared

  vida looked behind her and shivered
she had stopped there to wait for
spider and she had been looking back
expectantly thinking that she would see
him ride around the bend but now she
felt as though something horrible was
presently going to come around that
very point-something menacing she
kicked her pony in the flanks and rode
an hurriedly looking this way and that
for a way out of the gulch she felt
the blood oozing from her veins hiding
in her heart and pounding there heav-
ily where zvas spiderf why didnt
he come 

  she kept looking over her shoulder
her eyes wide with terror vida had
never before felt that undefinable fear
though she had ridden alone in these
hills at various times since she was a
child she had been scared when she
shot the mountain lion but it had been
a perfectly normal healthy fear lest her
bullets should fail to do their work

  she shook herself mentally and tried
to reason with her unreasonable dread
of something she neither heard nor saw
but only felt but all the while she
kept thinking of the something that had
followed shelton and spider and the
others-the something they could not
name but had felt behind them in the
dark she had riot thought much about
it before indeed save those few min-
utes of terror in the wagon when she
visioned a warlock she had believed
the story to be some obscure joke and
so had paid no attention but-but
this wras early afternoon

  had she not been afraid to do so


the cpcpular magazine

she would have turned then and ridden
back to find spider she would have
borne any repulse and reproach and
would have been glad just because he
was there with her close enough to
scold her and tell her-politely of
course-what a fool she had been to
leave him but she was afraid noth-
ing could induce her to turn and ride
back down the gulch she struck her
pony sharply with the quirt and went
on clattering over the rocks in a way
to rouse the echoes and let them clamor
her whereabouts to any one within a
quarter of a mile

  soon she stopped because she saw
how the gulch was drawing together
ahead of her unless it widened just
around the next point she would be
caught in a pocket if she could get
up the bluff she reasoned swiftly the
might follow back along the edge until
she saw spider and then call down to
him and have him join her up there
she gazed longingly up at the frown-
ing rock ledges above her up there
she believed she would be safe even
the scattered fringes of service berry
bushes and buckbrush looked comfort-
ing as if they could protect her from
something that was creeping up on her
from behind but there was no place
along the canon wall where her pony
could climb and vida caught herself
sobbing hysterically as she rode along
seeking a way out

  then her terror mastered her com-
pletely she pulled up and slid off
the horse in a panic and ran to the
shadowed side of the gulch and began
to climb when she had reached a ledge
that stood out flat-surfaced from the
steeper front of the ravine wall she
stopped and stood panting while she
watched with straining eyes the rough
trail she had ridden over but a few
moments ago something was coming
stealthily swiftly surely upon her trail
she knew it though she could see noth-
ing but the black barren rocks and the

stunted bushes and the wavering heat
lines where the sunlight struck full
upon the opposite wall

  and then a huge black head peered
cautiously around a sharp projection
of rock paused motionless for a long
minute and moved forward pushed by
the broad shoulders of a figure grown
horribly familiar even at that dis-
tance vida fancied that she could see
the little twinkling eyes that searched
the canon he was coming on with
swift stealthy strides that carried him
forward with amazing speed a noise-
less swinging trot that was half a lope
and that would in the long run out-
strip a horse a few steps so and
he stopped and crouched behind a bowl-
der so that she could see only the slope
of his shoulders

  with a sob suppressed in her throat
vida ducked into a crevice and began
to climb it was like her dream ex-
cept that in her dream the canon wall
was smooth and perpendicular and
now in reality it was broken and not
too steep if she chose her way very
carefully for the rest it was horribly
true-with burney stealing swiftly
along looking here and there for her
in the crevice she was hidden from
him but she dared not stay there he
would come upon her pony and know
that she had taken to the canonside
he would even know which side be-
cause the opposite wall overhung the
gulch in a thin shelf that had no hiding
place beneath he would not puzzle
one minute over her whereabouts-he
would know and he would climb up
after her and with his long arms
and his long legs and his enormous
strength to lift him up the bluff he
would climb ten feet while she was toil-
ing five

  she climbed and cursed the denim
riding skirt that caught on sharp points
and impeded her progress she tried
to keep her wits and to climb intelli-
gently and she kept an angle that
the spook hills mystepy



would take her farther down the canon
if she reached the top she would be
nearer spider and safety-for she felt
that writh spider she would be safe
there was np reason in that of course
for burney if he chose could kill her
and spider together with his hands
that was the horror-the great strong
hands of burney and his powerful
long arms even while she climbed
she kept glancing over her shoulder
terrifiedly expectant of his huge hands
reaching out even then to clutch her

  a rock whidi she had seized that
she might pull herself across a treach-
erous space of loose earth gave way
beneath her fingers and went clattering
down the bluff bouncing off ledges and
gathering speed and din as it went
breathless she watched it she could
not see burney but she knew that he
was down there and that his little twin-
kling eyes were seeking seeking she
knew that he would hear the rock and
would know that she had loosened it
in her flight from him

  she shut her eyes sigk with fancy-
ing what would happen then strangely
it would seem to her in calmer mo-
ments she never once thought of using
her gun though it swung heavy on her
hip and even hindered her movements
when she pressed close against a ledge
that is why i say that nerves are tricky
things in her nightmare she had not
thought of her gun and now when re-
ality was more horrible than any dream
she did not think of it it was as
though she had never heard of such a
weapon flight primitive wild flight
-that seemed to her the only possible
means of escaping those monstrous
clutching hands

  spider-where was spider why
didnt he come her pony left alone
down there snorted suddenly she
heard the rattle of rocks as he whirled
and fled back down the canon she
opened her eyes and looked for the
sound was almost directly beneath her

  down below her the pinto came gal-
loping amazingly sure-footed among
the scattered rocks that strewed the bot-
tom behind him running with great
leaps that ate up the space between
them came burney bareheaded evil-
faced intent on the chase the pony
ran into a jumble of rocks stumbled
picked himself up and swerved to find
an easier passage burney leaped di-
rectly in his path his long arms shot
out like the tentacles of some predatory
insect he caught the pony in a close
embrace around the neck he gripped
it leaning straining his great body
against the pintos shoulder vida hid
her face against the rock her knees
sagged under her with the ghastliness
of the thing

  her own danger galvanized her pres-
ently to action she did not look be-
low again-she did not dare she
looked up instead and took heart when
she saw how high she had climbed
another five minutes and she would be
at the top unless the bluff merely re-
ceded and went on up as sometimes
they did instinctively she nerved her-
self for that disappointment-she who
had learned well the ways of the hills-
and climbed desperately doggedly
breathlessly she would get to the top
-she would and she would run and
run and run till she found spider that
was the end and the aim of all her
efforts all her hopes to find spider and
be safe with him

  she had gone thirty feet perhaps
when she heard the half shout half
scream that told her shehad been seen
she did not look back-she only climbed
the faster there was something mani-
acal in the sound she sensed it even
in her fright and she knew that bur-
ney was crazy-that it was an insane
giant who was hunting her down she
knew then that had burney faced her
sane she would not have feared him
-not so much she would have felt


the popular magazine

that by sheer will power she could dom-
inate over even his bigness but a
crazy man could not be dominated by
anything save superior force she
climbed and climbed and never stopped
for breath and she heard him knock-
ing rocks loose down there below as
he lunged up the canon wall after her

  with a dry sob of thankfulness she
topped a low mossy ledge and stood
upon comparatively level ground
rough enough to prevent swift flight
but after that terrible climb looking
smooth and safe she stood still for
a moment straining her eyes to see
down the canon a narrow tongue of
a ridge this was and she could look
down upon either side the one up
which she had ridden lay empty of so
much as a rabbit but when she looked
down into the other she gave a cry of
relief

  oh spider spider hurry far
down the canon he was she could dis-
tinguish nothing save the outline of his
form and the color of his horse but
she waved her hand and shouted and
started running toward him

  from the bluffside below her came a
laugh and the sound was so close that
she glanced that way in fresh terror
she saw the bare head of the giant
show briefly over the top of the last
ledge and with a scream she ran on
down the ridge stumbling tripping over
rocks yet somehow keeping her feet
and making little moaning sounds in
her throat

  she did not look again for spider
she thought that he was too far away
-that he could never reach her in time
perhaps he did not even see her or
if he did see her perhaps he did not
care-was glad even to see her pun-
ished for leaving him the ridge
sloped sharply downward toward the
point where the canons had forked
even as she ran she remembered that
she had noticed the bare slope of this
dividing ridge and had even thought

of riding up it to get a clear view of
the surrounding country why hadnt
spider ridden up here instead of keep-
ing to the canon

  she did not look again behind her
she knew too well what she would see
she knew that if she saw burney on
the level coming after her with those
terrible long strides and those horrible
twinkling little eyes fixed greedily upon
her-she knew that if she saw him like
that the sight would paralyze her and
place her in his power so she ran and
she did not look back

chapter xvi

  when a man has spent nearly all his
life in the midst of great open spaces
certain of his faculties attain a high
state of development-unless he is one
of those incompetents who never does
grow up to the requirements of his
vocation spider was not an incompe-
tent  he had learned to see a great deal
in a short space of time and to rise
instinctively to an emergency though
he had lost vida in the canon it was
because he had not suspected her of
deliberately trying to evade him and
so had kept to the logical course which
was up the main ravine he had not
been greatly concerned over her imme-
diate welfare-he had too great a con-
fidence in her ability to take care of
herself and he believed himself to be
within shouting distance of her in-
deed he had been until she turned up
the side gulch and so widened the dis-
tance between them

  but even if he did not worry very
much about her he kept his eyes open
and let no living thing move unseen
within his range of vision he saw
vida the instant she came out upon
the crest of the ridge and he saw that
she was running from something in-
stinctively he knew what that some-
thing was and he dug the spurs into
his horse and charged the bluff as if
the spook hills mystbry



he were leading an army against some
puny breastwork the slope was steep
there and the half sterile soil was baked
hard between the grass tufts his horse
went lunging up to where he was
stopped by the broken rim of lava rock
which tops two-thirds of the desert
bluffs and makes hill traveling so labo-
rious

  spider jumped off and scrambled up
the rocks much as vida had done upon
the other side of the ridge but with
better progress once when he was
feeling for a handhold above him where
the ledge was almost straight above his
head he heard a shout on the level
above it sounded like burneys high-
pitched voice raised in a command to
some one it seemed odd that burney
should be up there with vida he had
believed that burney was riding off the
other way toward the river

  he clutched a splinter of rock pulled
himself up half his length and looked
over the ledge upon baked soil that
still sloped steeply up to the crest he
drew himself up by sheer muscular
strength over the smooth black rim
and ran up the bluff on his toes until
another ledge blocked the way and he
must climb again foot by foot clinging
with his hands and his feet to the face
of the rock had there been time he
might have found a crevice and gone
up more easily but there was not time
at least it was not for him to take for
granted anything save the girls dire
need of him

  he was still a few feet from the rim
of the ledge when he heard her scream
somewhere above him and close upon
the sound of that came the hoarse bel-
lowing cry that once before he had
heard and had never been able wholly
to forget his breath caught in his
throat but he went on climbing now
like a madman to reach the girl in time

  it seemed to him hours that he spent
on that ledge toiling upward with
vidas scream and that other horrible

cry ringing still in his ears it seemed
to him that he made no headway at
all but climbed and climbed in one spot
yet he presently found himself some-
how on the top running up the bare
crest of the ridge toward a titanic strug-
gle of some sort what he could not
at first determine he did not see vida
anywhere and when he realized that
she was not a part of the struggle he
drew his breath sharply and slowed a
little conscious of his exhaustion

  then just when he was steadying a
little from that nightmare of fear for
the girl he saw her lying on the stunted
grass all crumpled in a heap where
she had fallen close beside her they
were straining and struggling-two
giants of men whose breath came in
great gasps while they fought

  panting dazed to blank uncompre-
hension spider drew near and watched
the amazing spectacle there was bur-
ney fighting doggedly silently-fighting
for his life and there was another
huge human and yet not all human
fighting with little harsh snarls of sheer
animal rage and the lust for killing-
fighting not for his own life but for
the lives of these others he was
dressed in burneys old clothes-spider
remembered the gray-striped trousers
which burney had worn a year or so
ago tattered now torn short off at the
hairy knees of the giant he was like
burney in size and general outline of
face and figure and yet his face was
the face of an animal with its pro-
truding jaw and receding forehead and
broad flat nostrils his eyes were little
and twinkling and set deep under his
bushy brows his arms were hairy
his legs were hairy his feet which were
bare were huge misshapen things with
queer-looking toes

  while he stared spider began to un-
derstand many things that had been
muffled in mystery here was the an-
swer to the puzzle the thing that had
followed them through the desert in


the popular magazine

the dark the maker of the ber
tracks which had so excited shelton
the killer of sheep and dogs-and of
jake williams the monstrous shape
that had tried to get in the wagon that
night and could not because the door
was too small-a wave of physical
nausea swept over spider at the thought
of this great savage trying to get at
vida it passed and a spasm of terror
seized him as he realized suddenly that
she was lying there almost within reach
of the thing in deadly danger still
except for burneys straining strength

  spider darted forward lifted vida
in his arms and ran with her to a hud-
dle of great bowlders with bushes
growing between in the shade of a
buckbush he laid her down and stood
at bay between her and the thing his
gun in his hand ready to shoot at the
first menacing movement

  it came sooner than even his strained
nerves expected for though burneys
strength was prodigious the strength of
this other was something monstrous
burney was being beaten back step by
step inch by inch he was being borne
down great sweat drops stood on his
face his teeth were clenched in a
frozen snarl of supreme physical effort
his knees were bending slowly slowly
-his back was yielding the huge
hairy hands of the thing were reach-
ing reaching-the great talonlike fin-
gers were spread and tensed for the
death clutch the snarl broke sud-
denly into a scream to freeze ones
blood the scream which spider had
heard behind him in the dark-the
scream that had terrified shelton in the
cave and on the echoes of that scream
came a groan wrenched from burney
in agony

  spider sprang forward leveling his
big forty-five and pulling the trigger
as instinctively as he would have shut
his eyes in the face of a blow  the
thing recoiled swayed on his great
hairy limbs and sank to his knees

swayed there and toppled over strug-
gled uncertainly to rise and then lay
still

  burney removed the gripping hands
-relaxed now and harmless-and stag-
gered to his feet wiping the sweat from
his forehead with a trembling palm as
he stared stupidly down he looked
up when the thing had ceased to move
and took a tottering step toward spider

   s the girl all right he mumbled
dazedly his high-pitched voice trem-
bling a little i seen em-and i run

my horse-and got here just- he

looked down at the dead giant and
his face clouded

  come over here and sit down
spider suggested shakily  youre
about a-ll in he turned back and
knelt beside vida and fel her small
brown hands and laid his fingers gently
against her tanned cheek she lay as
she had lain the day before lightly
breathing deeply unconscious he be-
gan to chafe her hand changed his
purpose and put it softly down at her
side she had recovered from the
other fainting fit with no permanent
ill effect better let her remain uncon-
scious for a while-until they could get
her away from here he thought his
eyes tender and full of pity dwelt for
a minute longer on her face then he
rose and found himself a level place
on the rock and sat down looking curi-
ously from burney to that other giant

  you must a knowed all the time
about him he said abruptly jerking his
head toward the trampled battle scene
hes got on your pants

  burney lifted his chin from his heav-
ing chest and stared somberly at the
dead sure i knowed about him he
admitted dismally i never knowed
he was dangerous though-till he com-
menced killin sheep even then i didnt
think hed-tackle a human being hes
-always been harmless just-simple-
minded and wantin to live around in
caves like an animal he never hurt
the spook hills mystery



nobody-before it must a just growed
on him kinda from killin them-
sheep he heaved a great sigh took
his handkerchief from his pocket wiped
his face and then shook it out and
went over and spread it over the dead
face that was still snarling and came
back and sat down heavily

  i wisht we could keep this thing
quiet he said gloomily after a silence
a-course he wasnt responsible fer
what he done and he wasnt hardly

human but he- his face flushed

darkly i spose youd call him a half
brother of mine he said with a certain
sullen defiance of the fact my dad
was a squaw man up in montana that
was when i was just a kid him and
his squaw got mixed up with a grizzly
-and my old man was hurt so he died
the kid that was born afterward was
-him he nodded toward the inert
heap he wasnt right from the very
first soon as he could walk he had
the ways of an animal moren a human
yuh see his feet-a good deal like a
bears old mary-thats the squaw-
she just about worshiped him and
when he growed up and took to the
hills she went with him and lived the
way he lived and took care of him

  spider glanced toward the dead shud-
dered and looked away it is no light
thing to take the life of a human--
even a half human such as that thing
was he looked at burney strangely
and wondered what were his thoughts
whether he felt any stirring impulse of
regret or sorrow or resentment toward
the killer of his kin burney glanced
up and met spiders eyes and answered
the unspoken questions

  maybe i hadnt ought to be but
im glad hes gone he said soberly
hes always hung over my head like
a-a disgrace a thing like that
oughtnt to be left alive i always felt
that way about it ever since he was
born he couldnt talk-not words you
could understand  the squaw she

could understand what he wanted
there was something about him always
give me the shivers but i took as
good care of em both as i could i
used to send money up to a feller in
the bitter root that knew where they
hung out and used to pack grub and
clothes out to em he-burney
nodded toward the corpse-never
showed up in daytime so nobody
knowed about him except this man that
used to be my old mans pardner

  he died a couple-a years ago and
mary she struck out with-him-and
come on down here traveled nights
she said and there didnt nobody see
him mary never wanted him seen it
made her sore to have folks know he
was-different she used to hide him
like a deer hides her fawn when any-
body come around so thfey located
here in these hills and i packed grub
to em myself nights burney sighed
heavily as though the burden had taxed
all his strength and patience

  us fellows would a stood right by
yuh if youd told us about it spider
said with grave sympathy we could
a helped instead of yawping around
about a spook wed a kept our faces
shut if wred had any idee-

  i know yuh would but it wasnt a
thing a feller would want to tell unless
he was obliged to i never thought hed
harm any one i dunno what made him
start in killin sheep fer williams-he
must a got a notion they was enemies
i tried to git williams to move back
away from here i spose id oughta
told him why-but i didnt and so im
responsible fer a mans death he
humped forward brooding over the
tragedy

  i tried to git mary to pull out
he went on as though he was pleading
the case with his conscience sitting in
judgment i told her he was gittin
to act queer-when he commenced fol-
lerin you boys-and wasnt safe i told
her the sheriffd take im and shut him

tip if he took to botherin anybody but
she wouldnt budge and she wouldnt
do a thing well he added justly
there wasnt much she could dp she
couldnt keep him from running around
nights and she couldnt foller him and
keep him outa mischief i guess she
done all she could do

  i was in pocatello to see a doctor
and try and find out what could be
done fer him-id heard about opera-
tions on the brain thatd change a per-
son and i didnt know but what some-
thing could be done with him to make
him quieter and keep him from wantin
to kill i got uneasy when he com-
menced killin sheep well i didnt
go soon enough id oughta had him
tended to when i first growed up and
seen what he was like but he seemed
so harmless-and it would a been hell
to cage him up-and i hated to have
folks know about him its bad
enough he said doggedly to be so
big youre pointed at on the streets like
you was a side show broke loose and
to feel youre different and to have
folks think youre a whole lot more
different than what you are they dont
consider that im just a man-just like
everybody else-and just being bigger
dont make any difference in my feel-
ings if folks knowed i was related
to a thing like that-theyd think i was
some kinda beast myself i tried to do
what was right by him but i wanted
some kinda fair show myself

  well youve sure got it coming if
anybody has said spider after a
thoughtful silence youll git it from
me if we could do something with
the body he ventured tentatively with-
out looking at burney at all i dont
see why anybodyd need to know thered
ever been such a-person

  burney lifted his bent head and
looked at spider almost eagerly then
his face dulled again theres the
girl he said

  well-her maybe but you can

bank on that little girl burney shes
the real goods you neednt be afraid
of her if we can just manage to-to
bury him on the quiet

  his caves just down below bur-
ney said one of em anyway we
could put him in there that kid
started out to foller me back i met
him down in the foothills i guess i
throwed him off the trail but i aint
sure we better hurry if were going
to do anything if you think we can
and it would be right theres that
murder-

  well there wont be no more and
it wont be the only killin that never
was accounted for well tell the girl
about it so she wont worry no more
or be scared and what the rest of the
country dont know about it wont hurt
em any he stood up patently eager
to do his part howll we git him
down he asked not because he did
not know but with an impulse toward
speech that would make the thing less
horrible

  i can carry him you look after
the girl you better stay here and
kinda keep a lookout for the kid and
if mary-the squaw-shows up dont
try to tell her anything about it ill
tend to her she aint right in her
mind and she packs a knife she
might-- he did not feel that it
was necessary to finish that sentence

  spider stood sober-eyed and watched
burney gather into his huge arms that
monstrous shape of a man and go stag-
gering to the edge of the rock huddle
he watched him part the bushes in a
certain place with one hand pause a
minute there to make sure of his foot-
ing and go down slowly surely like
a man feeling his way down a crude
stairway bearing the limp thing with
the frozen snarl on its beastlike face

  then spider turned and knelt beside
vida and began to chafe her little sun-
browned hands pityingly tenderly and
to watch her face for the first quiver
the spook hills mystery



of an eyelash that would tell how close
she was to returning consciousness

chapter xvii

  and so yuh see spiders voice
droned in soft monologue it wasnt
anything anybody could help burney
he done all anybody could do hed a
prevented it if he could burneys a
fine man vida hes big-big-hearted
as well as big-bodied i wisht youd
try and like him he aint to blame
for what that idiot thing done he
feels pretty bad about it lie feels shut
off from folks kinda-as if he didnt
have no friends or anything i

wish-

  my foot hurts something awful
vida interrupted groaning a little she
moved her head restlessly in the crook
of spiders arm i- stepped in a hole
when i was running and gave it an
awful twist he-it was coining right
after me when i fell i-i remember
i heard a horse too-and burney hol-
lering but i was too scared to look
back or think that maybe there was
two of em im-glad its dead im
glad and thankful aint you

  im-thankful said spider and
pressed his lips tight together the
cold-steel look was in his eyes and
something else he pressed the girl
closer and bent his head and kissed her
with a grave tenderness

  you mustnt feel bad about it she
told him comprehending a little of what
was in his mind you saved my life
no i never spider disclaimed
quickly burney done that youve
got him to thank for that

  but you said he would a killed
burney you said you shot because

he was going to kill-

  i know-lets not talk about it you
owe burney a whole lot i want you to
remember that and i want you to be
good to him and not treat him any

different just because hes big wheres
your horse

  oh vida shivered in his arms
it-killed my pony just the way it

-did-

  never mind spider was pitifully
anxious to dodge discussion of the sub-
ject well say it fell or something
and broke its neck and thats how
you got hurt-sabe your horse fell
with you whereabouts was it we
better go back down that way i guess
in case shep comes prowlin around
you want to be careful what you tell
shep hes a good kid but mouthy
hed let the whole thing out to the
first feller he talked with

  anyway hed write it home to his
folks supplemented vida with a pain-
twisted smile he wont get anything
from me

  spider eased her shoulders gently
back against a rock and stood up scan-
ning the high-piled ridges and the deep-
gashed canons anxiously it would be
just as well if they got off that ridge
before shep or some other prowler
came within sight of them he was
thinking with that end in view he
went around the cluster of bowlders to
where the big brown horse of burneys
browsed apathetically upon the tender
twigs of a stunted currant bush he
came back to vida leading the horse
by the bridle

  i oughta take burneys horse down
off the ridge to where mine is he
explained in a worried tone shops
such an inquisitive kinda cuss hed want
to know what we was doing up here-r
and you crippled so you cant stand
you see dont you it wont do atall
for shep to spot us up here i wont
be gone but a few minutes-you aint
afraid are yuh

  vida was but she lacked the courage
to admit it instead she dissembled in
the most feminine manner and deceived
spider to the extent that his eyes bright-
ened with pride in her


the popular magazine

  youve got them all skinned for
nerve he told her in a whisper and
kissed again the lips that tempted him
if burney comes back before i do
you tell him ill bring both our horses
around the point and up the gulch where
you-got hurt he grinned mirth-
lessly over the stratagem he can
help you down the bluff-say you aint
afraid of him are you little girl

  no lied vida faintly i aint
afraid

  you hadnt oughta be burneys a
prince id like to carry yuh down my-
self but you better not wait we got
to think of burney and if were going
to keep this thing quiet we cant take
any chances-see  so ill meet you
around there just as quick as i can and
if you aint there he hurried on be-
cause of her anxious eyes ill come
back up here after you prontohe
held her close hating to let her go even
for a few minutes after the terrors
of the past hour you like me dont
you he whispered close to her cheek

   vida held him tight and it wras not
 altogether love that strengthened her
 clasp she was afraid horribly afraid
 but she was more afraid that spider
 would suspect her fear and love her
 less because of it  she forced herself
 to laugh a little and she reached up a
 brown hand and straightened his hat
 and pinched his ear and then pushed
 him from her

   i wish my foot didnt hurt so-id
go with you she said hurry up
wont you i aint afraid of burney
but-i aint in love with--him an
artful emphasis she put upon the last
word-an emphasis that would make
spider grudge every minute that sepa-
rated them so did vida prove herself
wholly feminine in spite of her environ-
ment and the things she must do be-
cause of it go on she commanded
 tenderly and dont be a big silly but
-hurry back kid if you dont want

me to change my mind about--liking
you

  he went then because he wanted to
help burney with his trouble a good
deal dazed yet was spider what with
this miracle of a girls love that had
come to him quite suddenly and the
amazing solution of the mystery that
had grwn so sinister he looked back
frequently while he was yet on the
ridge just to assure himself that vida
was real and to see her brown hand
waving him a message but he could not
make that other gruesome happening
seem real-not yet

  as for vida she watched spider with
sinking courage she was afraid up
there on the hilltop alone horribly
afraid her foot pained her dread-
fully and she was thirsty her head
throbbed heavily and she was lucky
to get off so lightly surely there are
not many women who could have borne
what she had suffered and borne it
so calmly

  most of all she dreaded burneys
return it was foolish but ones nerv-
ous system does not adjust itself auto-
matically to changed conditions and
she had been so certain that it was
burney who pursued her up the
bluff-

  she heard a rock kicked loose some-
where behind her and she turned sick
with fresh terror she heard him com-
ing heavily toward where she lay his
great feet crunching the gravelly soil
like the tread of a horse she shut
her eyes-and then when she felt that
he was standing close beside her she
opened them wide and stared up at
him there he was towering miles
above her-so her overwrought nerves
told her-and his little twinkling eyes
were fixed anxiously upon her face
he had something in his hands and
while she stared at him she saw his
face redden with embarrassment it
had been pale

  i brought up some water from a
the spook hills mystery



spring down there he said in his high
querulous voice i thought maybe
youd like a drink

 oh thanks vida sat up and
reached for the leaky old tomato can
he carried she had never dreamed of
thanking burney for anything but the
words came rather easily after all

  wheres spider he asked stand-
ing aloof while she drank thirstily

  vida took a last deep swallow and
set down the can burney could not
have reassured her so much in an hour
of friendly protestations as he had done
with that one little thoughtful act her
eyes lost their fear and antagonism and
became almost friendly

  he took your horse down the hill
hes going to get his and bring them
around up the gulch where-mine is
she explained he said-he said we
were to meet him down there hes
afraid shep might come and hed won-
der about our being away up here

  well its a good idee well go
on down then burney still stood fif-
teen feet away from her and he spoke
with a timid hesitation oddly at vari-
ance with his hugeness still they say
an elephant is afraid of a mouse

  vida eyed him queerly i-stepped
in a hole and gave my foot a twist
she informed him with an amused quirk
of the lips i-cant walk then
she watched him no she was no
longer afraid of him she was a woman
you see and he had betrayed the fact
that he was afraid of her it makes
a difference

 oh thats too bad- burney

shifted his weight to the other foot
for all the world like a bashful boy
before company

  vida watched him covertly spider
offered to carry me down but he had

to take the horses-she observed

demurely

  oh did he burney looked ready
to perspire his little twinkling eyes

wandered to the peaks high over her
head

  he said-maybe you wouldnt mind
-helping me-a little vida reached
down and felt her injured foot and
screwed her face into a grimace at the
pain of her lightest touch

 oh i-ill be glad to-help-

from collar to hatband burney was
purple with confusion

  im afraid youll have to-carry
me vida blushed a little herself but
her lips still had the amused quirk
if it wont be-too much trouble she
added

  oh no trouble-dont mention it
burney grew pale i-i hope we can
-be friends he stammered advancing
slowly i-

  never mind hashing things all over
she interrupted him hastily i want
to forget things be-careful not to
joggle my foot-

  not much of a reconciliation so far
as words went but burneys breath be-
came uneven with emotion did you
ever see a man take a butterfly from
his net carefully so as not to brushy
the bloom from its wings just so
gently did burney lift her into his arms
and carry her down the bluff and
all the while he did not speak he
could think of nothing to say that would
not sound irreverent

  vida spoke but once when he had
carried her with safe gentleness down
the steepest ledge it must be an awful
comfort to be so strong she said i
wish i was as big as you are

  burney did not answer her but his
eyes lightened gratefully

  since this story began with shelton
c sherman i suppose it ought to end
with him and since our editor man
thinks that you have heard almost
enough about these people of the des-
ert i may not tell you just what hap-
pened after that trip down the bluff
or what shelton did and thought and


the popular magazine

wanted  to do and couldnt but im
going to let you do something rude just
for revenge upon the editor man who
refuses to let a story go on and on
and never stop i am going to let you
read over the shoulder of shelton c
sherman while he writes to the folks

  he is in the bunk house writing at
one end of the table while spooky plays
solitaire upon the other end the lamp
stands between them and the chimney
is foggy for want of washing so that
the light is none too good and shelton
is hunched over with his nose so close
to the end of his fountain pen that
you will have to lean close also pike
-we didnt get very much acquainted
with old pike did we-pike is gum-
ming a wad of tobacco while he reads
a half-column article in the boise paper
telling what has not been done toward
apprehending the murderer of the sheep-
man in the piute hills country never
mind that-well just read what shelton
c sherman has to say

  shsh-sh-h-wait now till he takes his
fist off the upper half of the page
well since he shows no disposition to
move his hand-perhaps fearing that
spooky may be rude enough to cast a
curious eye over what has been written
and is able to read upside-down writing
-well begin with that line just below
his thumb

  -marry spider so im ail out of girls at

present she wasnt my kind anyway so i
dont care much there hasnt been anything
more happened since i wrote last we had a
big bunch of excitement and then it all fiz-
zled out like the time the lown fireworks all
went off in a bunch-remember excite-
ment a-plenty while it lasted only it didnt
last well thats the way out here every-
things at a dead level i dont even hunt
rattlesnakes with the girl any more-seeing
she got crippled and couldnt and then got
stuck on spider and wouldnt we havent
caught the fellow that killed her uncle either
nobody seems trying to catch him ive rid-

den spook hills till im sick of the sight
of them and i cant find so much as a bear
track any more i found a cave or two but
there was nothing in them i ut rat nests

  burney found that old squaw that i told
you folks about seeing wandering around in
the hills and he brought her in to the ranch
i wish you girls could see her ive taken
her picture and will send you one as soon as
i get the roll developed but id give anything
if you could hear her mumbling around the
ranch she walks with a crooked stick and
she goes hobbling around looking for some-
thing-nobody knows what sometimes she
gets wandering ofl in the desert and then
burney hunts her up and brings her back
hes good to her-makes me think theres
something in that story jim tells about bur-
neys father being a squaw man there cant
be any other reason for burney taking
charge of the old hag shes almost blind
and plumb nutty burney never says any-
thing about it and of course nobody would
have the nerve to ask him-not little me any-
how

  tell sis i havent given up hope of getting
that bearskin rug yet itll be a whopper if i
can find the one that made the tracks i saw
spider did think it wasnt a bear but a man
disguising his tracks but he admits now
that it was a bear most likely he says
though that bears have a habit of changing
their range every once in a while and that
this one may be a hundred mies from here
by this time i hope not ive got my heart
set ou his hide for a rug-

  for the lordy sake shep what you
writin a novel asked spooky just
then sweeping the cards together with
his palm and speaking in a tone of deep
disgust it always makes spooky cross
to have the game run consistently
against him when he is playing mex
the clerical industry of shelton c
sherman has always roused within him
a futile irritation honest to gollies
i should think the hind side of a pic-
ture postcard would hold all that hap-
pens in this derned desert but some
folks can write all day and never say
nothing what yuh tellin em  did
yuh put in how spider went and cut
yuh out with the girl

the great cardinal seal

     	 by robert welles ritchie

author of the sandlotteretc

   a brand from the fire which the inscrutable japanese brother kindled
in korea at the close of the war with russia the hitherto unwritten story
of the search for the great cardinal seal of korea relic of three hundred
kings which played a mighty and might have played a mightier part in
the history of the ancient kingdom

chapter i

  concerning a gray stray curl

some old duffer of long ago who
prided himself on his neat and
trenchant wisdom witnessed a lit-
tle domestic near-tragedy on his
hearthstone one day and straightway
coined a very hefty saw which has
passed down through the ages as a bril-
liant truth a burned dog is afraid of
the fire this ancient party said and
since then folks have blindly accepted
this aphorism as one of lifes simple ver-
ities  it has place along with spare
the rod and as the twig is bent in
the worlds institute of pious frauds

  at this late date i rise to object

  it depends upon the dog

  and in some measure upon the fire

  there is a dog of my acquaintance
named happy who sacrificed one eye
and a leg to an automobile let a gaso-
line wagon approach him on the side
of his good eye and he will give that
machine the finest exhibition of three-
legged and one-eyed defiance any dog
could put up it was the same way with
bethell and myself we got badly
burned by the fire the japanese brother
kindled in korea at the close of the
a

war with russia yet we went right
back to it and risked a second singe

  we were such gay dogs you see
and it was such a fascinating fire in
short wre proved the maker of that ben
franklin model proverb a paretic

  of course tipping over the wisdom
of the ages is a foolish business no-
body but fools and youthful fools at
that ever tries it as i sit in my ten-
by-twelve apartment-house library and
wonder whether the lady in the apart-
ment below is going to put too much
mustard or the rosary on her
canned-music machine next i am con-
vinced of the fact that when good old
bethell and i went to the shadows of
that mournful land of the morning
calm to have our second little fling at
the fire we were neither of us a good
insurance risk a pawnbroker prints
on the back of his ticket disclaimer of
responsibility for acts of god fire
flood and the public enemy no ticket
would be big enough to contaiu the
jokers an insurance broker would insist
upon in case the party of the first part
planned to go to korea and attempt to
put a spoke in the wheel of japanese
diplomacy there

  how we tried to kidnap the emperor


the popular magazine

bugs and how the girl bethell and
i miserably failed when we had the old
simpleton well outside the walls of
seoul on the road to freedom that was
our first flirting with fire and i pub-
lished the chronicle of it about a year
ago as some may remember bethell
the slashing bull-headed editor of the
korea daily news the japanese caught
red-handed and they contrived to have
him sentenced by his own british con-
sul to a years imprisonment in shang-
hai he served his term came pluckily
back to seoul revived his paper and
was ready for another go at the mas-
ters of the tottering empire i piloted
the girl to shanghai on the yacht we
had waiting down the han river to
convey his majesty to a russian asylum
and there i left her never expecting to
see her again her mission inspired by
a very clever russian politician had
come to naught she was broken-
hearted

  as for myself i followed a fool-
hardy impulse to return to seoul and
face the music i went and found no
music-not even a lisping fife note
either the japanese governors had not
full proof of my complicity in the daring
coup or what was far more likely they
knew everything and were willing to
bide their time until they could accom-
plish my removal from this ball of dust
quietly and practically with no pain-
just a dagger stroke in the dark i
lived therefore in all the pleasurable
excitement of a wild thing surrounded
by pitfalls and spring guns and on
nights when i went out alone i wore a
very light and strong shirt of steel mesh
under my evening dress you might
call it a chinese ypsilanti very cooling
to the nerves

  in the summer of  two years
after our abortive attempt to smuggle
old bugs out of the country marquis
ito sat supreme over the dust heap of
seoul as resident general ten thou-
sand bayonets spiked down the coun-

try for japan all sovereignty save the
shadow of the old emperor on the
throne was swept away and he poor
duffer was a prisoner in his own palace
he didnt dare sneeze without license
from hagiwara his keeper

  his imbecile son the crown prince
squatted among his favorites in the
womens quarter of the palace and
played go days on end he didnt have
the intellectual equipment of a turnip
the korean ministry a craven lot who
licked the hand that fed them gave the
semblance of authority to whatever
measures the resident proposed the
imperial korean army barracked in
seoul performed dreary evolutions with
rifles whose ammunition did not fit and
artillery with the breech blocks missing
a farce the whole sordid business at
which the japanese usurpers smiled in-
dulgently when they were ready they
would ring down the curtain and stage
a new play-made in japan

  aye it was a shadow land wherein
the shadows clotted drew closer in
strangling grip netted themselves like
serpents of poisonous mist over crum-
bling pagoda tower and tottering throne
of three hundred kings

  a day in june i rode from chemulpo
the port to the capital when the train
drew into the station at south gate only
one white person beside myself a
woman stepped from the carriage be-
cause she was a white woman and ap-
peared to be traveling alone-an un-
usual circumstance particularly in the
disturbed condition of the country-my
attention was attracted to her and i
suppose it was some vague sense of
service that kept me lagging on the plat-
form to see how she was going to fare
with the hurly-burly of porters and
rickisha men i soon saw she was not
faring well what with the shawl rolls
the umbrella straps accordion baskets
and what-not of impedimenta that mark
the english traveler and the clamorous
bids of jap and native porters who sur-
the great cardinal seal

       i



rounded her snatching at each bit of
luggage she could not actually tuck un-
der her arms the stranger appeared
quite at her wits end i hurried across
the platform gave two of the nearest
coolies a whack with my stick and of-
fered my services as interpreter and
cicerone

  she turned her head and her eyes
as they met mine suddenly opened wide
in surprise the lady actually jumped
so startled was she at the time i set
her start down to the twittering of
harassed nerves perhaps she did not
expect to encounter one of her color
there in that welter of orientalism she
was such a queer old bird anyway
gray-headed no her hair was a
streaky gray-rusty like the collar mark
on a white horse pinched face regu-
larly plastered writh kalsomine bleach
so that when she attempted a smile it
cracked wide mouth with lips frankly

rouged and eyes- well the eyes

didnt fit the rest of that picturesque
ruin they were violet and sparkling
and strangely youthful against the
painted mask of cheek and hair one
would have said the old girl had 
dropped her youth overnight through
some tragic decay of her charms but
the ghost of what had been still sat in
her eyes the last withered stalk of
wild aster in november with two purple
stars of blossoms looking bravely into
the face of winter that was she and
she was dressed to the part with flouncy
skirt a rather mannish traveling coat
built like the fatigue jacket of a grena-
dier and scotch bonnet of some rough-
ish material which sported a great auks
wing feather i have seen pictures of
english militants who greatly re-
sembled her a genteel english maiden
on the reticent side of forty i set her
down one of those self-reliant members
of the restless sisterhood who failing
to bag a man in youth devote their
spinsterhood to shooting big game in
uganda or measuring the heads of

solomon islanders or carrying the light
of feminism to the oppressed females
of nepal the type is commoner in
the far east than in our own country

  ah thank you thank you kind
friend she piped in that peculiarly
shrill voice the fogs of england breed
this is quite too strange-arrd-ah-
confusing a welcome to seoul the
coolies you know they tear a body to
little bits unless some one intervenes

  she laid the tips of her fingers on
the back of the hand i had extended to
relieve her of her bundles i would
have said the lingering touch was a bit
bold had she not been so adequately
protected against misunderstanding by
her crackleware style of beauty as
it was i was constrained to a quick look
into her eyes and i thought i caught
just the fleeting of an impish spirit of
mirth there

  you live in this city i take it the
rare old dodo hastily put in you can
therefore direct me to the best hotel i
neglected to inquire about the hostel-
ries before i left shanghai

  theres no choice madam i an-
swered promptly one goes to looies
astor house or sleeps on a futong at
a jap hotel which isnt comfortable i
am on my way to looies and if i can
be of any service-

  very good very good she ac-
cepted my offer as a matter of course
and i summoned three rickishas

  the strangers multiform luggage was
piled to the canopy top of one i handed
her into another gave direction to the
leading coolie and off we started skirt-
ing the great wall of the city i was
mildly amused at the adventure specu-
lated on what the men at the club would
say when the news that i had piloted
such a rare bird of passage to looies
nest should come to them of course
it would not be three hours before word
of the strange ladys arrival would be
all over town so searching and so busy
is the wireless of gossip in seoul


the pocpulacr magazine

  what could this elderly female per-
son be doing alone in such a backwater
of the tides as the korean capital
surely she was not a new missionary
else she would have gone directly to the
mission compound on the hill nor a
tourist tourists come to seoul only
rarely and then in batches of ten or a
dozen piloted by a japanese cooks man
a plain unattached freak then un-
doubtedly but-and i admit most of
the ride to the astor house was de-
voted to a consideration of the subject
-those eyes those youthful strangely
misplaced eyes in the kalsomined face
of faded freshness they did not go
with the part and somewhere-yes
somewhere some time--i had encoun-
tered eyes like those-deep and untrou-
bled amethyst intaglios possessed of a
power to glow with a light all their
own like a jewel cut with a buff top

  but that crazy scotch bonnet with its
spike feather the rakish fatigue jacket
and the ftouncy skirt ah perish the
hazy vision of amethystine eyes in some
forgotten face

  looie the excitable gaul who pre-
sided over the blighted destiny of the
astor house gave me a reproachful
look heavy with meaning when i es-
corted my discovery into the office and
up to the register she told him in
blunt english that she wanted his best
rate by the week she didnt know how
long she would remain in seoul but
the length of her sojourn would greatly
depend upon the comforts he gave her
and the price he charged

  and mind you my good man i
have traveled a great deal and i jolly
well know when i am not receiving
proper worth for my money she
shrilled as she put her fist to the
register

  looie made his most voluble guaran-
tees and the lady was led to her room
by one of the pussy-footed native
chambermen looie was no less alert

than i in pouncing upon the register
to see what she had written there

  theodosia tooling dorsetmount
england

  the scrawl bold and masculine of a
part with that furry scotch bonnet and
fatigue jacket told us nothing not
even a miss preceded the signature
to give it the softness of sex looie
groaned when he read it

  ah zees man-oomans better i
should an elephant receive in my hotel
magnificent troobles now attend

  for perhaps a half hour we sat in the
deserted office listening to the banging
and bumping of theodosia unlimbering
her luggage she called for hot water
she called again to protest against the
cake of geological soap on her wash-
stand she summoned looie to her
room to inquire if the site of his
hotel was altogether sanitary-which it
wasnt nothing being sanitary in seoul
i found unholy delight in goading the
frenchmans volcanic anger to the ex-
ploding point after the third response
to theodosias summons looie called
upon the twelve little buddhas of
mokpu to witness that he louis thom-
medieu levanner would on the mor-
row expel this sottish englander into
the ditch but the crowning comedy
bit came when miss tooling was de-
scending the stairs to enter the dining
room the japanese intelligence of-
ficer who in those days was one of the
busiest adjuncts to the resident gen-
erals secret police intercepted the lady
at the foot of the stairs notebook in
hand and pencil poised through the
open door of the office we could catch
the whole conversation that ensued

  ex-coos kind madam-your name
plees

  a very audible snort-a snort of high
dudgeon

  ex-coos kind madam it is-neces-
sity

  and why my good man should i
tell you my name icily replied theo-
the gpert cardinal seal



dosia furthermore do not address
me as madam it is impertinent
there was a sound of a sucking in of
breath-the idiotic japanese mark of
politeness the intelligence officer be-
gan all over again with his ex-coos
dear madam

  well my name is theodosia tool-
ing i am a native of dorsetmount
somersetshire and my maternal grand-
mothers name was-

  if so kind plees to spell-slowly
the purring japanese was unper-
turbed

  a very uncommon name i grant
you falling barometer and signs of
storm t-o-o-l-i-n-g and the family
coat of arms is a griffin rampant with
a-

  and kind madam you have-come
from where looie and i had our
arms about each other by this time his
tears splashed on my bald spot

  do you wish my whole itinerary
theodosia snapped or shall i confine
myself to the eastern hemisphere
from-where kind madam oh
the sublime patience of the east

  you may put down luang-phara-
barig kyoukmyong bahawulpore and
in tonkin-but ill wait for you to
get this all very carefully down there
was a pause then the unruffled little
intelligence officer began again

  your bus-i-ness plees

  landlord oh landlord impera-
tiveness lay in that rasping shout the
lady theodosia had evidently reached
the end of her patience looie wiped
the tears from his eyes and bounded
into the hall

  landlord rid me of this impertinent
man  ah the fine british scorn on
the rasp edge of her voice i could see
looies hands go up in expostulation
his shoulders lift to his ears

  mais non madame eet ees ze law
of zees con-try to make zose inquiries
i am responsible for you to make an-
swer

  mumpf then tell this wretched
person my business is to lecture on the-
osophy-to spread the light of pure
reason in a dark world she said this
with a startling emphasis of finality

  i confess her statement caught me
between wind and water i had ex-
pected militant suffragism swedish
massage or even an encyclopedia can-
vass  but theosophy-in dead-and-
buried korea looie evidently was
even more flabbergasted than i i doubt
if he had ever heard the word before
certainly he didnt know its meaning
he thrust his head into the door and
made a frantic appeal for aid with eyes
and twisted mouth in my security of
the office i smiled blandly back at him
and waved my confidence in his ability
to rise to the situation

  just then i heard the front door bang
and bethells roaring voice

  whats this whats this  uh oh
at your service madam names beth-
el-bethell of the daily news just
out of jail and proud of it but want
to warn you of my character whats
the row oh i see little question
mark here jolly little beggar when

nition of theosophy teaching the lan-
guage is at fault not bethel

  the intelligence officer half the
pages of his notebook covered with
ideographs made his exit the lady
theodosia trundled truculently into the
dining room and sniffed loudly from
time to time during the course of her
meal as for bethell he joined me at
the bar with a quizzical pucker about
his eyes

  i say billy noble old ruin isnt
she  honor to albion she is quite so
but did you see her eyes the little
editors flushed face was all alight with
boyish interest ripping thats what
girls eyes in an old womans face a
stone bearing blossoms as the japs
say

  i did not confide in bethell my fool-
ish superstition concerning the power
of theodosias eyes to awaken half-
formed memories he would have
laughed but when we took our seats
in the dining room some distance away
from the table the english vixen oc-
cupied i noticed bethell chose the seat
which gave him a view of her face and
during the course of our discussion of
her and her outlandish mission to seoul
he kept muttering those eyes-deuced
strange once he used the word
haunting i chaffed him unmerci-
fully begging him to give me an opinion
on the scotch bonnet and the ladys
peachblow complexion but bethells
unconscious affirmation of the strangely
reminiscent effect of theodosia tool-
ings eyes upon my own mind cloaked
the gawkish figure at the near-by table
with undoubted fascination

  the much-traveled theosophist did
not invite closer acquaintance though
we three were the only ones in the din-
ing room and she was the single woman
guest in the establishment she pre-
served a frigid aloofness when a bend-
ing to companionship even without the
rigid formalities of introduction cer-
tainly wtould not have been forward of

her under the circumstances as soon
as she had finished her meal she called
for a lamp and retired to the mystery
of echoing hallways upstairs bethell
and i hard ridden by the lonesomeness
of seoul at night-a jungle of shadows
unrelieved by a single light-went list-
lessly about our billiards on looies
rickety table in the bar we were alone
in the room and after nine oclock the
only persons stirring about the hotel
in the dark outside prowled the night
watchman the clinking of the little
metal rings on his staff was like the
shivering of crisp icicles the night
was hot and the three windows in the
bar were opened to the assorted odors
of the city

  perhaps it was eleven oclock and
we were still knocking the balls about
the baize suddenly-bethell came
a sharp whisper at my very elbow i
whirled in time to see a scrambling
shape of white launch itself through
the window then there was darkness
bethell had blown out the lamps an
instant of pregnant silence there in
the dark bethells hoarse whisper
broke it

 you-yong

  yes bethell ive come

 hands here-join hands-yong
billy i felt bethells hand fumbling
for mine along the edge of the table

  now-quiet he whispered and he
led me and that other-that ghost shape
out of the night-around the billiard
table through the door and into the
hall i heard the first tread of the
stairs creak under bethells foot then
i was mounting a padding foot kept
pace and pace with mine we crept
down the long corridor on the bedroom
floor and turned into a room i knew by
the distinguishing odor of rank tobacco
to be bethells a match scratched and
flickered and a very tiny wick in a
night lamp by the bed caught the flame
bethell closed and locked the door
then took his metal match safe from
the great cardinal seal



his pocket and delicately adjusted it
to even balance on the upper face of the
doorknob-an old trick of his putting
the combination lock on eavesdroppers
he called it the lightest touch on
the outside knob would cause the match
safe to drop

  do i catch a smile here do i hear
some reader say comic-opera stuff
enter the villain to shivery music
very well  smile with you-and at
you now in my snug five rooms and
bath with dumb-waiter janitor and
canned-music perquisities perhaps i get
your viewpoint but back in those days
when bethell and i fooled with matches
over the powder pit of korea reck-
lessly throwing ourselves into the
koreans cause because of anglo-saxon
sympathy for the under dog we had to
play opera bouffe occasionally death
was as handy as whisky and soda-and
as bad

  in the feeble light of the night lamp
i could take a survey of bethells mys-
terious visitor even i who knew him
well did not instantly recognize yong
chi-sun-baron yong he was called
in the dirty white rags of a coolie-a
coolie of the night-soil class-the young
fellows identity was almost completely
hidden barelegged and with the ideo-
graph denoting his degraded trade on
the back of his linen shirt his top-
knot rising from his head without the
covering of hat or band this tall rangy
young fellow would hardly pass as the
scion of a house ancient as the stones
of kyeng-pok palace

  baron yong chi-sun eldest son of
a former prime minister under the re-
gent tai-wun held his bachelors de-
gree from one of the largest univer-
sities in the american southern states
had lived in paris and petersburg was
in short a cosmopolite also he was
one of the few real korean patriots in
the black days of the japanese occupa-
tion baron yong had first thrown his
enthusiasm with ii chin hoi a pa-

triotic society whose purpose was to fire
korean resentment against the swift en-
croachment of the little men from the
neighbor islands but when through
the liberal use of japanese gold ii
chin hoi suddenly shifted its mask
and came out as strong supporters of
the invaders baron yong went  to
america in disgust -

  he had but recently returned via
europe and the trans-siberian in ten
days since his arrival in seoul the baron
had made several ineffectual attempts
to see bethell and myself alone but the
vigilant espionage the japanese kept
upon the fighting british editor as well
as himself had frustrated his plans we
only knew bethell and i that baron
yong had something of greatest im-
portance to tell us that much we got
through the wireless of servants
quarters

  for all his rags baron yong was
every inch the patrician as he stood
smiling his hands outstretched to grasp
ours none of the doltish impassivity
of the typical korean yangban in his
features the high forehead of the
man bespoke intellect and even though
his face was cast in the oval mold dis-
tinguishing the high born in die penin-
sula the breadth between nis fine sharp
eyes and the firm lines of nostril and
mouth negatived the effeminacy of the
type countenance if there were more
like baron yong in dour cho-sen his-
tory would be wrritten differently to-day

  dear friends he said his eyes
kindling with a great enthusiasm i
bring you good news for korea a
wav out lies open to us if we can only
take it

  bethell had his fingers to his lips in-
stantly warning against the others
lifted voice we drew together about
the little lamp and there in a shadow-
splashed circle we stood while the baron
poured out his tale in scarce suppressed
whisper

  one way out-yes one way out


the popular magazine

he repeated and thats at the court
of the world-the hague the con-
ference meets there in september and
korea must be represented korea
must make there her open plea to all
the world for justice-and her national
life

  whats that-whats there  bethell
broke in impetuously the japs per-
mit delegates from korea to the hague
conference never fear

  listen the young man impatiently
silenced the editor you know the let-
ter i carried from his majesty-car-
ried out of korea and half across the
world in the lining of my shoe that
letter was delivered to the proper per-
son in petersburg and--yong named
a man so high in the secret councils
of czar nicholas and such a present
force in blind european diplomacy that
i must give him a pseudonym say the
prince asterisky-and prince aster-
isky gave me assurance that if korea
had authorized delegates at the confer-
ence the czars agents would stand be-
hind them to the point of making an
issue of japans conduct in this land
then the truth-the whole bitter truth
of our slow murder as an independent
nation-will come out japan will stand
revealed the strangling cord in her
hands

  i wish i could reproduce here the
feel of that minute there in the sickly
lamplight-that fine korean patriot
fired with the lure of his countrys last
hope those two white intriguers eng-
lishman and american thrilling to it
as if their own countrys destinies lay
in the hollows of their hands there
in the dark night of koreas existence
-under the shadow of a grandeur that
was greatest when columbus sang a
te deum on san salvador these three
mites heard a promise of help from the
other side of the world to their ex-
alted vision appeared the figure of a
czar bending his ear to catch the last
gasping cry for help from a nation in

the hands of the strangler oh such
minutes are glorious in the dreary mo-
notony of lifes little villainies

  i do not know what russias game
is continued the baron i do not seek
to go behind the promise i only know
that i have the sworn word of a man
who never gives his word carelessly

  true i put in but how can we
get his majestys proper authorization
for delegates to the hague how get
them out of the country under the eye
of ito

  unless their credentials or what-
you-call-its bear the emperors signa-
ture or his seal bethell supplemented
the delegates might as well be armed
with pawn tickets so far as admission
to the conference goes

  theres thie big trouble yong an-
swered its kept me awake nights all
the way across siberia his majesty is
a prisoner in his palace under the sleep-
less eyes of hagiwara he is not even
allowed to see the crown prince alone
yet we must get to him tell him of the
hope that lies for us at the hague have
him put his seal to credentials for two
men and then-

  then our troubles just begin
bethell was quick to take the barons
speech from his mouth once we have
his majestys great cardinal seal on
these credentials how get the men they
authorized out of korea youre
watched like a mouse yong the few
others like you who would be good men
for the hague are watched too if
youve got to sneak here in a coolies
rig how much harder to make chemulpo
or fusan for a steamer

  silence fell on us then the magni-
tude of the job we were ready to put
our hands to appalled us for a minute
how could three men all of them
watched make through the hedge of es-
pionage the invaders had built around
the person of old bugs-to call maj-
esty irreverently out of name how
combat the guile of the craftiest ser-
the great cardinal seal



pent in the whole japanese nest hagi-
wara the ubiquitous eyes and ears of
ito

  do you think the emperor still has
his seal bethell popped the question
with his characteristic explosiveness
you know hes never set the cardinal
seal to the treaty of protectorate and
theres a rumor he slipped the precious
bit of crystal out of the palace and to
some monastery back in the mountains
for safe-keeping so he couldnt be
forced to use it on a jap-made docu-
ment

 theres another- baron yong

checked himself as if shot bethell and
i felt the same congealing shock that
had stopped his lips

  the metal match safe had dropped
from the doorknob it struck the floor
with a sharp knock

  bethell acted first he whipped a
short-barreled automatic from his coat
pocket swept the night lamp up in his
left hand and was at the door in a
bound an instant he stood there his
ear against the panel then he quickly
set the lamp down on the near-by edge
of the washstand and holding his
weapon at the hip threw the lock and
swung back the door with a single
movement

  blackness there naught else

  yong and i crowded to the doorway
and as bethell lifted the lamp above his
head we peered up and down the hall-
way as far as the feeble radiance car-
ried not a sound nor a shadow yet
the match safe had fallen

  i think we looked into each others
eyes with a half-incredulous half-
shamed air then we stepped back into
the room and bethell started to close
the door

  hello

  yong suddenly stooped and picked
up something that lay next the door-
sill so close to our feet that we had al-
most trodden on it he held his find
to the light his face all drawn into little

puckers of surprise bethell and i
brought our heads together over the
koreans hand

  what it held was a six-inch curl of
womans hair it was a rusty gray and
at one end was the hairpin that had
skewered it to its wearers head

chapter ii

theodosia rampant exit

  how long we three stood there like
dolts gazing at that grizzled wisp of
hair i do not know bethells eyes met
mine and a question shot between them
she-theodosia tooling that frumpy
owlet from dorsetmount-she eaves-
dropping and on the night of her ar-
rival incredible yet this same theo-
dosia tooling was the only creature un-
der looies roof that night who wore
long hair-and gray hair we couldnt
go behind that the evidence seemed
incontestable	si

  well look into this thing in the
morning bethell grunted as he closed
and locked the door therell be no
more listening at keyholes to-night
thats certain

  of course yong could not share the
suspicion that curl of false hair had
fired in us nor did we reveal our
mutual conjecture somehow it would
have been absurd for two men wise in
the ways of the land to accuse a freaky
waif just in from the beyond of the
china coast of playing the national in-
door game so soon after her coming i
confess though that when we drew our
heads together once more to plot and
plan ways for accomplishing the great
adventure yong had outlined that
absurd twist of hair seemed to assume
personality and to take its place as a
fourth party to our cabal it lay under
the night lamp where bethell had
thrown it and try as i would i could
not keep my eyes from its drab and
snaky convolutions everything inan-
imate is perverse in the dreary lexicon


the popular magazine

of korean demonology a false curl
dropped outside a door guarding trea-
sonable conference was not an omen
of joy

  we talked until the first streak of
dawn light on the rugged face of puk-
han warned yong that he would have to
flit through the wasting dark to regain
his home undetected we saw him fling
himself over the rear wall of the hotel
compound one with the slinking cats
in stealth then t went back with beth-
ell to his room to smoke and drive at
the abattis of our problem until the
sun came we found no gap in the
bristling hedge about the sacred person
of old bugs at every angle of attack
we saw eyes-the eager watchful eyes
of the japanese eyes at the doors of
the royal prisoners palace eyes in the
coiled shape of the dragon on the screen
in his audience chamber eyes frescoed
on the shoji of his bedchamber of all
persons in the peninsula his majesty
bugs was the most jsolated-one hap-
less individual under the patient scru-
tiny of threescore slant eyes our
single hope for a successful start on the
harebrained venture lay in the farewell
promise of yong

  unless he has been corrupted like
the others he said there is one man
still close to his majestys person who
may serve to carry our message through
the japanese lines old tai-song the
keeper of the wardrobe has been con-
sidered harmless enough to stay in the
emperors household i think i can get
word to him and gold enough to tempt
him you will hear from me soon

  so perforce the matter rested with
us we had but to wait in patience
while yong burrowed into the secret
places of the palace under the suspended
samurai sword

  there was a matter of immediate in-
terest however-the telltale lock of
hair bethell handled this in his -char-
acteristic bull-charging way while i
a volunteer greek chorus stood ready

to carry through the action by strenu-
ous recitative if need be the stage
was the lonely dining room of the hotel
time about eight-thirty a m

  very red-eyed and soggy with tobacco
smoke and no sleep bethell and i took
our seats before the lady theodosia
made her entrance we dawdled over
the marmalade and coffee until with a
mannish tread and a defiant flapping of
her rakish auks wing the little sister
of the occult flounced to her table and
took her seat with her back to us she
did not favor us with so much as a
glance scorn spoke from the bony
angles of her elbows from the nest of
watch-spring curls-veritable mates of
the curl-which bounced and waggled
at their moorings in the nape of her
neck when he had finished with his
breakfast bethell noisily pushed back
his chair rose and strode toward theo-
dosias table as he neared it he drew
from his coat pocket the coiled and
hairpin-skewered evidence of a maiden
ladys indiscretion

  he came to a stop by theodosias el-
bow and with a blunt little bow laid
the curl on the tablecloth by the butter
dish

  miss tooling he began in his
usual throaty roar i believe you
dropped this-ah-article of the toilet
outside the door of my room at eleven
oclock last night i found it there just
half a minute after you dropped it

  i could see the ladys freshly kalso-
mined cheek the smile that wrinkled it
as she turned her eyes to bethells
with something like a simper she an-
swered him

  this is-very considerate of you
mr-bethell i think the name is i
havent many of these-er-appendages
and i imagine it would be hard to re-
place one lost in korea

  sublime innocence or sublime impu-
dence i choked as i saw bethells
jaw drop he was so pathetically help-
less before the unexpected retort theo-
the great cardinal seal



dosia calmly picked up the betraying
curl and tucked it with its kin in her
coiffure the chunky little editor glow-
ered at the twist of hair as it took its
place in the fair tooling superstruc-
ture then he shook his shoulders like a
challenging mastiff and returned to the
charge

  i said miss tooling that i picked
up this-ah-lock near eleven oclock
last night some gentlemen were in my
room at the time we were having a
private conversation yet i found this
just outside my door-just below the
keyhole in fact might that not be
rather embarrassing to you 

  this was drawing it too strong i
was on the point of rising to pull beth-
ell away when theodosia answered-ah
so sweetly

  it would have been embarrassing
indeed mr bethell she purred if
you had found the-ah-lock just inside
your door

  bethell whirled and fled out of the
dining room theodosia applied mar-
malade to a bit of toast with the least
concerned air in the world

  guilty by the lord harry my
vanquished friend stormed when i
joined him in the office i tell you
billy that woman can afford to be
watched shes playing some deep
game thats what shes doing tut
tut there maskee that laugh or ill
proper well give you what-for

  events of the next few days proved
that watching theodosia could well be
counted one of the pleasurably excit-
ing pastimes of seoul--at least of the
foreign contingent in the capital not
since the invasion of hideyoshi had
such a restless spirit coursed through
the rotting-worm tracks of the old city
theodosia was a veritable will-o-the-
wisp in scotch bonnet and fatigue
jacket one minute she would be set-
tled in the living room of the british
resident boring the unhappy wife of
that official through and through with

theosophical shafts the next she would
be launching her esoteric doctrines in
a machine-gun fire at the head of the
third assistant secretary to marquis ito
in the big residency building her
voice was tht of the pelican in the wil-
derness  it failed not from morn to
dewy eve there was not a lady of the
legations who did not hear its high-
pitched rasping objurgations to follow
the light not a starred and belted baron
who did not barricade himself in his
office against the descent of this ravag-
ing hun of pantheism first she was
a joke then a nuisance then a terror
when men came to the club for the
five-oclock high ball they ducked into
the protecting portals with a hunted
furtive air and the common hail to
them from the chairs was have you
met theodosia

  but particularly did the tooling
avenger haunt little hagiwara the boss
of the palace and in this fact all for-
eign seoul found great joy hagiwara
was not a popular person his office
the determined british proselyter made
her favorite roost she shouted down
all of the understrappers who would
bar her way to the hagiwara spider
web patiently sat under her green um-
brella on the steps of the office until
hagiwara must either make a dash for
freedom or starve waylaid him on his
missions to marquis itos house pur-
sued him by rickisha bombarded him
with accusing letters it was a new and
bitter experience for the suave little
chief of the spy squadron the hunter
was hunted whatever professional
suspicion hagiwara may have enter-
tained as to theodosias mission to
seoul-and he was suspicious on prin-
ciple of every new white face in the
city-must have been dissipated by
growing conviction that theodosia
tooling was innocent of every form of
humkn frailty except insanity it is
reasonable to suppose that hagiwara
believed her to be some strange and ter-


the popular magazine

rible species of british female never be-
fore seen in the far east

  doubtless it was just this conviction
that led to the surprising thing theo-
dosia had audience with his majesty
bugs

  i will always believe hagiwara hit
upon this idea as the most refined of all
the little cruelties he and his crew de-
vised to keep the mind of the hapless
prisoner in a constant state of terror
turn theodosia loose on the emperor
and she would do what fear of poison
and the knife had failed to accomplish
there would be nothing remaining to
arrange but the formal obsequies

 whatever hagiwaras motive the
fact remained that theodosia tooling
of dorsetmount did what no foreigner
in seoul man or woman had done in
nearly two years saw and talked with
the emperor of korea in his palace
and alone so gossip buzzed through
the city save for the necessary pres-
ence of an interpreter a korean all
who marveled at her triumph felt too
that a distinctly japanese trick had been
played on the old boy there was a fine
sense of derision in thus sacrificing his
pitiful dignity to the assaults of such a
harridan as theodosia

  her audience occurred just a week to
the day from the time of her arrival
that night bethell sent one of his print-
ers to my house with an imperative
message that i join him at looies im-
mediately i was at my dinner when
the coolie arrived in half an hour i was
trundling through the black streets in
my rickisha a misty rain made the
night stygian i could hardly see the
bobbing head of my puller so dense was
the darkness only occasionally did a
cranny of light shining through the
shutter crack of some house give proof
that i was in the heart of a city of
thousands and not a desert in mon-
golia not  half a dozen pedestrians
passed me-pale ghosts swinging tiny
star lanterns of white-oiled paper in

their hands on such a night one shares
with the natives the certain belief that
the tiger ghosts are abroad the rain
dragon can snatch a loose topknot
they have it

  at the astor house i found bethell
in a high state -of excitement he
dragged me into a corner of the shabby
bar before i had shaken the wet from
my coat

  the word from yong he hoarsely
whispered were to meet him at
eleven in the lotus pavilion of the old
palace he sent just that message
nothing else by old hi-dong his house
slave all depends on to-nightthats
the way he put it something big-big
billy yong must have got a message
through to the emperor the big
scheme is moving

  for two restless hours bethell and i
speculated upon what the tryst in the
old palace grounds would bring forth
as we knocked the billiard balls about
the table then a little after ten
oclock i left the hotel bound by a
roundabout way for the appointed meet-
ing place bethell was to follow and
we were to meet at the breach in the
wall on the puk-han side of the ancient
palace inclosure and then proceed to-
gether through the wildwood tangle to
the lotus pavilion

  the rendezvous baron yong had ap-
pointed was in the midst of the
strangest junglet in the world-the old
kyeng-pok palace compound set in
the heart of dead seoul are these fifty
acres of ghost walk the hovels of the
people pressing against its walls on
three sides and on the fourth the savage
granite of puk-han cliff behind its
barred gates decay and desolation are
locked-palace halls pavilions a royal
library of blue-glazed brick a throne
hall whose steps are worn hollow by
the feet of thousands of courtiers deer
parks archery courts flimsy summer-
houses and toy bridges over fish potjds
all-all in the ruin of neglect the

last emperor forsook kyeng-pok when
queen min was hacked to death and
burned in the deer park and built him
a new palace in the far corner of the
ancient inclosure-the palace which was
to become his prison house in the black
days of the japanese occupation

  i went on foot from the hotel tak-
ing the full time of an hour to skirt
the walls of kyeng-pok to the breach
no ghostlier sally have i made in all
my life in the wet blackness of the
night the guarding stone lions at the
palace south gate loomed large as mas-
todons every uptwisted gable was a
witches toboggan each square tower set
on the walls crest the stronghold of
fantastic archers of a dead day i
found the breach unchallenged and
there crouched behind a pile of the
fallen masonry to await bethells com-
ing he splashed through the mud to
join me and together we groped our
way through the tangle of ruins to the
lotus pavilion this was merely an
unwalled summerhouse built on a plat-
form over a fish pond a fancifully
gabled roof hung over it on carved pil-
lars  a gingerbread railing of teak rose
from the floor oh a dismal ghost-
ridden place

  together we waited for perhaps half
nn hour listening to the patter of rain
on the lotus pads and the r-r-r-rick-
r-r-r-rick of some ghoulish insect in the
rotting beams over our heads then the
snapping of a twig near at hand the
noise of a foot on stone bethell
whistled very low a voice out of the
dark called bethell

  another minute and the muffled white
figure of baron yong stepped out on
the little causeway leading to our re-
treat another blurred shape followed

 they drew nearer baron yong

stepped aside as they gained the plat-
form with a little gesture of deference
to permit the one accompanying him to
pass and greet us first curiously we
moved forward so dark it was we al-
most had to rub noses with the stranger
to identify him

 theodosia too-tooling good
lord



  bethell stumbled back-against me as
the exclamation leaped from his lips

  no bethell-no billy the voice
in the dark was low and infinitely sweet
theodosia tooling no longer to you
dear friends just the girl-the girl
whom you helped to kidnap the em-
peror two years ago and who failed-
with you

in the dragons nest

  one who has spent twelve years west
of the one hundred and eightieth paral-
lel is supposed to be inured to shock i
discovered that instant there in the rain-
drenched pavilion that i was not yet
surprise proof even when i felt the
girls hand in a heartening clasp and
could see dimly under the peak of the
tooling scotch bonnet the eyes of her
with whom i had once traveled the
treacherous path of high adventure i
could not believe that the late theodosia
and the girl of stirring memory were
the same

  with one voice bethell and i began
to put eager questions

  hs-sh v she cautioned and put her
fingers quickly upon our lips another
time we have something mcre impor-
tant than explanations on hand come

  but look-a-here girl bethell per-
sisted a grieved quality in his tone
why theodosia tooling why did
you come back to seoul and fool us
-your friends willing to help and
that gray curl outside my door why
you spied on us you were eavesdrop-

ping i knew it on us the only people
in korea who-

  listen bethell listen billy she
put her arms about our shoulders in
the way of a comrade and drew our
heads to hers i was sent here by-
by the same big man whom baron
yong saw in petersburg to do what the
baron and you planned to do that night
in your room at the hotel yong did
not know he-that big man in peters-
burg-was sending me i was told only
to find him here in seoul and act with
him i had to come as theodosia--
here she laughed a little at her own mr
hyde incarnation i imagine-because
that was the best way i did listen at
your door bethell-very clumsily too
j admit-and discovered you were al-
ready playing my game so-what to
do  play it with you and i have
now come

  whats up i asked yong who had
stood a little apart from us during our
colloquy

  we go to meet his majesty the
korean replied simply

  picture the strange procession
through the midnight dark of deserted
kyeng-pok-scuttering phantoms in the
pleasure places of long-dead kings the
girl walked with her hand in mine for
guidance  we did not speak but from
her strong confident fingers there
passed to mine the bold full pulse of
her soul-the soul of indomitable youth
daring all in the lead of romance
mercifully the dark hid the physical
mask of theodosia tooling instead
of the kalsomined cheek the penciled
brows the pitiful lines of waning bloom
refurbrished that made the apostle of
theosophy a dreary object in the eye of
intolerant youth i could see in the clear
vision of remembrance the radiant
beauty ot firm round throat and cheek
crowned by masses of hair the color of
bronzed autumn oaks what a sacri-
fice of her jealous feminine values the
girl had made in becoming theodosia

tooling of the rusted locks and what
an artist of make-up she had proved
herself v

  baron yong leading we threaded the
wastes of deer park and courtyard until
we had come stealthily to the low wall
which bounded the small inclosure of
the new palace yong brought us to
an angle in the masonry where the wall
swerved to avoid a big rock and there
we huddled together waiting-for
what 

  he will come though it is danger-
ous the girl whispered little hagi-
wara helped me arrange the meeting
when he admitted me to audience
though he doesnt know it

  the rain swept our faces and a mis-
shapen pine branch above our heads
swayed back and forth in the fitful wind
like the arm of some unlaid ghost we
were cramped wet horribly uncomfort-
able minutes dragged

  a stone tossed from above fell at
our feet with a little startling sound a
voice called softly yong-yong
we were on our feet in an instant
there over the low top of the wall al-
most flush with our faces the night had
breeched two mummy shapes of white
swathed and formless

  your majesty

  yongs low exclamation in the ver-
nacular suddenly brought us to a reali-
zation of the proprieties uncommon as
was the occasion bethell and i swept
off our hats the girl bowed profoundly
vong prostrated himself

  hurry-hurry say what you have
to say before the japanese discover his
majestys absence the command
came from the emperors bodyguard
who was the faithful tai-song the
loyal member of the household whom
yong had reached

  we all drew near the wall baron
yong and bethell began speaking hur-
riedly to the emperor in the court lan-
guage from the little i understood i
knew they were putting before him in
the great cardinal seal



the most glowing terms the hazard of
the hague delegates occasionally his
majesty interrupted with an eager treble
piping the old fellow grew so agitated
his stuffed and padded body swayed
perkily this way and that

  what does he say bethell the girl
inquired eagerly her restlessness un-
der the handicap of the alien speech
would not let her keep silence

  hes for it the editor flung over
his shoulder then renewed his earnest
conversation in the korean tongue for
another minute the buzzing over the
wall was uninterrupted once his maj-
esty uttered a sharp exclamation in a
querulous childish outburst and beth-
ell growled an abrupt oath then yong
took up the burden of the argument
pleadingly speech between the three
flew so fast i could not follow it i only
knew that some serious objection had
been raised by old bugs to which he
seemed to cleave with a mulish stub-
bornness

   an none 

  the hail in the japanese popped like
a cracker in the dark beyond the wall
then a flash of light dim in the back-
ground of trees behind the emperor

  a-a-a-ai the royal prisoner
moaned and his head dropped below the
wall like mr punchs at the arrival
of the hangman

  quick-quick  bethell whirled
about and grasped one of the girls
hands i took the other yong in the
lead gripped bethells wrist and we
ran blunderingly away from the wall
into the bramble tangle of the old pal-
ace grounds there was a sudden spray
of light behind us as a lantern was lifted
over the wall we heard a gruff call
to halt in the japanese tongue a
whistle trilled and somewhere off in the
dark another answered all the nerves
of hagiwaras spy guard wrere thrum-
ming to the alarm

  as i look back at it now that race
of ours away from the trysting place

was something like bad boys escape
from an orchard and a farmer with his
gun yes-maybe but also i reflect
upon the dreary wildwood of kyeng-
pok  how easily it would have concealed
for all time the result of a chance shot
in the dark

  we ran i do not know how far and
finally came to a stop under the eaves
of some crumbling building because
breath lacked there was no sound of
pursuit doubtless none was attempted
the japanese jailers being content with
catching the emperor at a forbidden as-
signation

  it was here as we huddled together
out of the drip of the rain bethell and
yong reviewed their conversation with
the royal prisoner and told the girl and
me of the stumblingblock the old loon
had put in the path of our scheme his
majesty welcomed with the joy of a
seasoned intriguer the project of send-
ing delegates to the hague conference
and on the spot commissioned baron
yong to be one of them and choose his
fellow delegate but at signing his name
to their credentials old bugs balked-
flatly refused

  his majesty rightly says yong ex-
plained that no document of state
bears his signature it must be stamped
with the great cardinal seal which was
the seal of kija first ruler over
cho-sen

  rot bethell broke in impetuously
the old boys afraid to put his hand
to the credentials for if the japs
grabbed them hed be condemned by his
own signature if the cardinal seal
alone is on em he can swear it was put
there without his authorization whats
more he hasnt got the seal says he
smuggled it out of the palace and up
to the u-cham monastery on diamond
mountain so the japs couldnt force
him to use it there you are--no seal
no credentials no hague business
seal hidden away somewhere by a lot
	the popular magjfzinb

of rooty old monks who wouldnt give
it up if buddha himself demanded it

  then there is but one thing to do
the girl bore down bethells grumbling
by her calm assurance we will go
and get that seal

  and this will open the way yong
supplemented his majesty gave it to
ie just as the japanese called his
personal luck charm

  from hand to hand passed the curi-
ously wrought bit of jade yong pro-
duced we could not see it could only
feel the complicated involutions of that
chinese ideograph which in korean
fetichism represents the all-in-all of fa-
voring fortune old bugs had indeed
made a sacrifice in giving up the luck
stone next to the soul tablet of his fa-
ther it was his most precious warder
of harm

  we planned then the trip to the
u-cham monastery away back in the
shadow land of the mountains two days
by chair from the railroad we planned
at that strange hour and place because
we were together and there was no
forecasting when at another time we
might gather unsuspected though
yong and i urged against the girls
making the journey she would not be
put off she said she could not remain in
seoul while the big adventure was
moving forward elsewhere bethell it
was agreed should not attempt to leave
the capital he was too well known out-
side the central zone of japanese ac-
tivity to escape detection once his ab-
sence from the city was noted by hagi-
waras men it was problematical even
if yong and i could leave the walls in
canopied chairs and await the girls
coming at a certain point on the railroad
without being spied upon it was a
desperate sally we were to attempt and
the chances of success were ten to one
against us we knew that but we had
the emperors luck stone to confound
the thousand devils of japanese inter-
ference and the smiling god youth un-

calculating servitor of romance was
nudging our elbows

  so under the dripping eaves of
kyeng-pok we perfected the details of
our raid on the great cardinal seal and
after a handgrip all around we parted
to pick our way severally-except that
i piloted the girl-out of the labyrinth
of moldering grandeur to the safety of
familiar roofs so finished a night that
even now flashes in memory like the
blinding wthite beam of a searchlight in
the dark

  the mother of all the dragons
suckles her young in keum-kang san

called by the foreigner diamond moun-

community of men no less bizarre than
the monstrosities of nature surrounding

maining monasteries in korea they
are the decadent remnant of what was
once the national faith-the flotsam

  here in the aisles of the mountains

  seoul lay three days behind us and
we three-the girl yong and myself-
found ourselves in the heavy fist of
keum-kang san at the third setting of
the sun she in a rough mountain
chair hoisted on the shoulders of sturdy
coolies yong and i following on foot
we traveled in a land raw and crude as
on the worlds first day the trail led
through the black gap of a gorge back
and forth over a thundering torrent
bridged by tottering planks

  as the light gradually failed the bleak
sides of the canon closed in on us like
a dungeons steel walls against the
orange blue of the sky stunted pines on
the gorge rim opposed affrighted hands
to the approach of night the narrow
vault hummed wtith the steady diapason
of tumbling water it was a time and
place of terror vague unsettled

  we walked in the precincts of the
gods of primordial things yong the
bachelor of letters the cosmopolite
strode silently by my shoulder his face
grave and fixed under an effort of will
once i caught the look in his eyes and
matched it with the fear that widened
the eyes of the nearest chair coolie
through all the veneer of travel and
study the korean nature of the man was
pushing into the ascendency

  it was dusk when we emerged upon a
little plateau over the softer voice of
the torrent came to us the throb-throb-
throb of a great bell somewhere ahead
in the graying valley the heavy bell
note was answered by others the gath-
ering dark pulsed with the beat of wood
on metal yet not a light ahead not a
sign of human habitation the wilder-
ness had suddenly become vocal we
passed through an ancient burial place
about us strange tumuli lifted them-
selves in the shadows rock lanterns and
mushroom growths leaned drunkenly
this way and that still the booming
of the bells spirit bells ringing the
requiem of the ancient dead

  suddenly we came upon u-cham sa

ca

-a sprawling blot of temple pagoda
and bell tower against the lighter dark
little lights pricked out here and there
the glowing of great hidden lanterns
cut the porch pillars of a shrine out of
the night we heard the intoning of
many voices the chair coolies began
to croon a labor song and quickened
their step we were out of the grip
of goblins at last and on sanctified
ground

  our coming tq the great monastery
made a considerable stir when the
evening chanting was finished-a serv-
ice we bided in the shadows of the
largest temple-fully a hundred shave-
polls gathered about us chattering ex-
citedly and we were conducted into the
presence of the chong-sop or abbot
he was a man of benevolent counte-
nance paunchy and good-humored he
received us in a bare vaulted room of
stone and hewn wood at one end of
which sat on a dais a dingy buddha
gazing with placid lacquered eyes upon
two smoky dishes of burning oil at his
knees

  the open door through which we
passed instantly became crowded with
jostling priests and novitiates fighting
for opportunity to feast their eyes on
the strange sight of a foreign woman
the presence of the -curious ones
which seemed to disturb the abbot not
at all made it impossible for yong to
state our mission he had to invent
on the moment some specious fabrica-
tion about our being travelers who had
undertaken the difficulties of the road
for a view of the wonders of u-cham
though we sat with the reverend abbot
for many hours balanced on the un-
comfortable narrow benches and yong
talked with him interminably the vigil
at the door did not abate

 you must remember yong an-
swered the girl when she interjected an
impatient protest against delay you
are in the one place in the universe


the popular magazine

where the word hurry does not exist
time moves like a tortoise here

  the evening was wasted-uncomfort-
ably wasted in the end the abbots
tardy sense of hospitality overcame his
garrulity and we were shown our
sleeping quarters-narrow cells with a
pallet of rushes in each clean how-
ever at the door of her stone box the
girl paused to give me good night

  billy she said and there was a lit-
tle quaver of nerves and fatigue in her
voice i-somehow feel as if-as if

- oh id rather be fighting hagi-

wara in seoul than trying to bore into
the-the blind something here this
is not our world i-fm afraid well
-fail

  i took those words to my rushes with
me it was strange nerve-straining
thus to hear from one who faced every
hazard without flinching such a con-
fession of doubt

  with the sun came new hope after
a strictly buddhistic breakfast of
strained honey and pine nuts supple-
mented by tinned biscuits which the girl
in a moment of saving inspiration had
added to her traveling bag we met the
abbot this time through yongs
clever contrivance alone

  never again i hope will i have to
sit in such a place of horrors as that the
abbot chose for this morning s audience
it was the temple of the ten judges
the magistrates who hold the woolsack
under the dominion of the lord of
buddhistic hell and pass judgment
upon the human chaff whirled down to
them on the wind of death the
interior of the temple smoke-blackened
by the candles of thousands of votaries
and hung with sable gonfalons of silk
like drooping bats wings wtas dim and
shadow-haunted the only spots of
light were those cast by the flickering
tapers and the dull-red eyes of the cen-
sers ranged on the shrines of the ten
wooden idols

  it was when one stood before a shrine

and caught by the flutter of light the
outlines of the mural paintings behind it
that the chills were spine breaking for
there in heavy reds oranges and blues
were depicted the ingenious tortures of
damned souls in torment-ferocity
passing belief as the flames of the
candles waxed and waned the mouths
of the victims opened and shut in
spasms the eyes of devils gloated fires
in the pictured purgatory leaped and
died over the whole interior-musty
judges swaying black banners hell fires
-brooded a sullen spirit of malevo-
lence

  it was the abbots favorite roost

  in yongs eyes as we took our places
cross-legged on the mats i saw the same
strained look of mastered terror i had
observed in the gorge the evening be-
fore somehow the mans structure of
foreign culture seemed to be crumbling
bit by bit i do not know what told me
this unless it was the look in his eyes
and a certain loosening of the corners
of his mouth reliance and self-confi-
dence appeared to be sloughing away
from our friend here in this dim moun-
tain fastness of the unseen

  the girl beside me her fascinated
gaze wandering from one pregnant cor-
ner of shadows to another i bent all
my attention at trying to master the
sense of what passed between baron
yong and the chong-sop after a
lengthy introduction in which the seoul
patriot tried to give the priest an idea
of the swift political changes going on
in the capital he came down to the
object of our mission the reverend
master of the monastery listened with
close attention his face bare of the least
flicker of emotion until yong brought
out a silk handkerchief from beneath
his linen outer coat untwisted it and
displayed the emperors luck stone-the
carved ideograph of moss-green jade
then up went the eyebrows of his rev-
erence  he sucked in his breath with a
whistling sound
the great cardinal seal



  a command to you from the heaven
born yong said he sends his stone
of fortune to bring back to the palace
the great cardinal seal of his ancestors

  the monk sat in silence for a minute
then scrambled to his sandaled feet and
shuffled away into the gloom we heard
the hinge of a door creak a boarcl crack
and then we were alone none spoke
the spell of the grim place was on
us all

  back padded the abbot in his hands
a bundle wrapped about by purple silk
he eased himself to the mats with a
little groan and then as he fumbled at
the knots of silk he began mumbling
some jargon of ritual all of us leaned
forward expectantly the fat hands
were an interminable time untying the
silk when the wrapping fell a small
silver niello-work casket was revealed
twice the monk started to open the
caskets top and twice his hand hovered
uncertainly over the catch his intoned
prayer became of stronger timbre his
little eyes rolled excitedly at last he
turned the hasp and threw back the
cover

  a square ray of limpid light leaped
from the silk-upholstered interior it
came from a carved block of clearest
crystal quartz-an oblong tablet with a
ramping chinese lion-dog surmounting
it as a handle through the clear
depths of the crystal block the red-
crusted involutions of ideographs on
its stamping face could be seen

  the great cardinal seal royaltys
stamp of authority since korea was
born a nation from the mists of
legend

chapter iv

a fox juggles with destiny

  not until i came to reflect upon it in
the light of subsequent events did i
find full explanation of yongs curious
conduct the minute of the great seals
uncovering for an instant he sat in
petrified awe as did all of us for that

 matter so compelling was the pure
 beauty of the ancient relic then he sud-
 denly bent forward on his knees as if
 to prostrate himself he checked him-
 self midway of the sweeping gesture
  his face flushed and his eyes dropped
 as if in shame at the impulse of rever-
 ence of course i thought at the time
 a patriotic korean would feel a sense
 of veneration at sight of this instru-
 ment of hoary royalty just as an eng-
 lishman looking through the cage at
 the crown jewels in the tower of lon-
 don might thrill before the scepter of
 edward the confessor but yongs in-
 voluntary act was different again the
 native in him flashed to the surface-
 the blind unreasoning fetishism of the
 korean

   it was the girl who broke the awk-
 ward silence

   well now that we have it we had
 better start at once for seoul

   yong stammered something in the
 korean which i could not catch in-
 stantly the abbot with a quick protec-
 tive gesture slammed shut the lid of the
 casket and gathered it under his arm
 his face was scowling he muttered
 some reply to yong

   the abbot says yong interpreted
 that of course we cannot move the
 great seal from u-cham until the proper
 prayers have been said and the signs
 have been consulted to determine a
 propitious day for its departure
 what folly the girl broke in
 scornfully a bit of carved quartz
 here his reverence interrupted with
 a veritable torrent of words out of
 which i picked bad luck improper
 impious yong listened respectfully

   you may not understand he ex-
 plained when the abbot had finished
 that this bit of carved quartz as you
 call it is a holy relic in the eyes of
 the monks here in it lie the spirits of
 all the old kings whose hands were set
 to it from the dim past to the present
 i-i-maybe i do not make myself


the popular magazine

clear when his majesty secretly sent
this seal up here it was placed before
the shrine of his majestys ancestors-
became a part of that shrine it can-
not be moved until the monks have a
sign from the spirits of the dead kings
permitting its removal even in the
face of a living emperors demands it
cannot be moved until then

  how long will it take them to get
this message from the beyond i
asked striving to mask my impatience

  there must be a period of fasting i
presume the baron answered and
then they will begin to look for favor-
able signs in the rocks-the trees-

everywhere of course-

  baron yong the girl sternly took
him up do you believe in all this
mumbo-jumbo business 

  a deprecatory smile quickly passed
over the patrician features his hands
fluttered to his lips

  oh no of course not you must
remember i do not believe in anything
-this with a conscious air of cynicism
but of course-i told you time means
nothing to these people-the customs of
the country you know-must be obeyed
- suppose

  he finished very lamely with a nerv-
ous little laugh

  but have you explained the neces-
sity of quick action i asked the
hague conference convenes in septem-
ber  this is july we are on the oppo-
site side of the world and even with the
seal in our possession much remains to
be done before you start with your cre-
dentials come man you forget the
destiny of a whole people hangs on our
success

  again yong loosed a volley of argu-
ment at the chong-sop he sat like an
aged tortoise his brown shaven head
thrust a little way out from his shoul-
ders his eyes narrowed to mere slits in
the wrinkled flabby face the apotheo-
sis of the unruffled unhurrying east
when yong finished the old boy merely

shook his head and smiled then scram-
bled to his feet and the sacred casket
under his arm pattered away into the
gloom he did not return we waited
there in that hall of horrors for long
minutes none speaking yong sat with
hands folded across his knees his face
placid there was something of the
buddha in his pose the bells began to
boom then-a dozen-a score they
roared and moaned and tinkled in every
register the mountains threw back their
voices in a jumbled echo somewhere
out  the sunlight beyond the stern
judges of hell and the fires of torment
rose a dreary unison chant of mens
voices

      namu-namu amida butsu

      na mu ami tabu

   oh i must get out of this

  the girl jumped to her feet with the
strangled cry and ran for the temple
porch i followed yong still sat
hands folded on his knees amid the
ghastly crew of the inferno

  we walked together she and i out
into the drenching sunlight under the
giant cedars past the huddle of tem-
ples and cell houses past the tottering
headstones in the burial ground on and
on into the primitive wilderness we
went until the voices of the bells were
softened to silvery music and the chant
was a drone ahead of us and on either
hand the crags leaped up to smash holes
through the solid blue vault of the sky
pink and gray spires of splintered gran-
ite the pines lay thick on the slopes
like heavy rugs foaming leaping
twisting snakily among the bowlders
roared the stream liquid jade

  we were two alone in the desert gar-
den of the mountains and the girl was
 gloriously a part of the wild beauty of
the place no longer the pinched and
kalsomined cheeks of the harridan
theodosia the dowdy curls the frump-
ery grenadiers packet instead the
bloom of youth on rounded cheek and
throat lips untouched by art brow un-
the great cardinal seal



harrowed by lines the bronze-gold
hair i knew to lie beneath the stain of
gray was indeed unrestored but even
the gray masses parted simply over the
brows accented the youth and fresh-
ness of the face beneath her eyes-
those sparkling eyes which had wrought
such strange reminiscences in me the
day i met theodosia at the south
gate station-were now clouded with
anxiety

  ah billy she said as we found a
seat in a circlet of nodding wild flowers
im afraid we are fighting an unmov-
able obstacle-battering our heads
against the eternal do-nothingness of
the east as well try to move that
bowlder with a toothpick

  if theyd only give us a handle
against them i complained oppose
us in the way white men do but no
what is is 

  and yong she added yong the
bachelor of letters-yong the world
citizen familiar with the boulevards and
the cafes chantants-our sturdy patriot
billy hes going back hes slipping-
slipping into the korean again did
you catch his attitude there where we
left him buddha-buddha of the ten
thousand years contemplation billy
were alone-alone here in the garret
of the world with nobody around but
unpleasant ghosts who-si-sing horrid
chants

  she faltered and the droop of her
shoulders was eloquent i tried to
rally her spirits yong i reassured her
was all right he would find a way to
cajole the abbot into giving up the seal
without all the palaver with the spooks
it was natural he should feel the spell
of u-cham differently than we did
mysticism and the fear of the unseen
were born in his blood all he needed
was a little prodding i would wield the
goad

  why do i do these things my
friend she turned her eyes to mine
they were filled with seriousness why

do i a woman with all a womans in-
stincts for--for domesticity-a home-
soft comforts-why do i come to a land
the worlds forgot to play the part of
interloper why did i come here two
years ago and lead you billy and beth-
ell to risk your lives helping to get a
stuffy old monarch from seoul to
shanghai one night i am stumbling
in the ruins of kyeng-pok here in
korea the next i may be trying to
make a japanese secretary of legation
in berlin fall in love with me over a
dinner table so i may steal his secrets
the japanese have a fairy tale about
a fox woman who changes her form
to do mischief in the dark i am a fox
woman-nothing less

  girl its because you are you thats
all maybe she did not realize that i
had her hands in mine and as i knew
full well all my clumsy tongue refused
to utter was said by my eyes maybe
she did not realize i dared to think
maybe she wished it so

  it is youth-the youth that dares
the world to keep romance hidden from
it to deny adventure youth is crea-
tions masterpiece but it passes and
then-

  ah well i am not going to put on a 
page for every eye to read all that we
said there in that little glade of wild
flowers enough to say that the half
promise the girl made that day that if

ever she really could be mrs- well

she didnt keep it

  i will leave blank the three exasperat-
ing days of inaction that followed and
hurry on to the events of the surpris-
ing fourth yong who showed strange
variableness of character blowing hot
and cold in alternate moods i roweled
unmercifully for hours at a time he
and i walked the mountain paths i con-
juring him by all the dumb mouths of
koreas helpless millions to cut the knot
of tomfoolery binding the seal and take
it away at once we could not stay on
at u-cham indefinitely awaiting the fa-


the popular magazine

vorable sign of the spirits even added
day of our absence from seoul meant
that the japanese spies must inevitably
trace us to the mountains and guess
our purpose i tried to- shame the man
with his superstitious compliance with
the abbots dictum asked him if he
feared the pursuit of vengeful ghosts if
he should lay violent hands on a piece
of carved rock crystal at times yong
would flare into anger at my charge
that he had become the slave of korean
shamanism the next minute he would
be dodging and ducking with silly ex-
cuses against disturbing the custom of
the- land

  on the third night of our inaction
yong drew me aside after we had left
our very aesthetic evening meal in the
refectory he showed signs of great
agitation

 to-morrow-at dawn-we go away
from here he said while the monks
are at the five-oclock prayer service
we will slip out the girls chair will
be waiting at the graveyard

  that means we take the seal with
us i sternly answered

  yes-yes i know where it lies in
the casket on the shrine of the dead
kings i will get it some time to-night

  but the abbot i objected hell
be furious we cant go faster than
the chair coolies in case of pursuit

  beyond the graveyard they cannot
pursue yong whispered it is a law
of the monastery only the begging
u-cham and they only at certain
times

  yong was very white and shaky but
i was convinced he had come to the
sticking point we said no more about
the morrows flight

  that night after the evening prayer
we went to visit the abbot in his cell
while the girl and i sat on our feet
and blinked like chessy cats yong car-
ried on the conversation for us by
proxy his reverence exuded urbanity

he told us no less than thirty monks
had begun the propitiatory fast in an-
ticipation of asking the spirits of the
dead kings for a favorable sign within
a month at the most he thought every-
thing would be right and the seal could
go to seoul in the meantime the hos-
pitality of u-cham was freely ours

  i slept little that night and before dawn
i had slipped out of my narrow cell and
roused the girl who occupied a some-
what more pretentious apartment in the
government guest house we waited in
the deserted halls of the guest house
until the jangle of the bells summoned
all of the inhabitants of u-cham to the
great hall of the four sages for prayer
then we stole furtively through the half
light of the morning down past the ter-
rible temple of the ten judges and
to the green mounds of the burial place
the chair coolies were there waiting
also yong

  i really felt sorry for the man when
i first saw his ashen face his lips
were blue his eyes roved the whole
aspect of him was one of abysmal ter-
ror i asked him if he had the seal
his lips would not move to answer but
he held up his silk handkerchief a
square object was knotted in it i of-
fered to take it from him but he shook
his head and clutched the precious seal
closer to his breast i suppose he felt
the responsibility for it should rest
solely with him since he had stolen it
from the shrine of the kings

  the girl hopped into her chair her
eyes alight with happiness i gave the
order and the coolies started forward
on a dogtrot in our ears was the
never-ending namu-namu and the
clashing of the bells u-cham dropped
back into the mists of morning

  yong and i started together at a
swift pace following the bare feet of
the coolies over the narrow tortuous
trail he said not a word but his lips
moved constantly as if repeating some
exorcism of the devils the hand that
the great cardinal seal



gripped the ends of the knotted hand-
kerchief wherein reposed the seal was
pressed against his heart the knuckles
were whitened under the flexure the
trail led down past the pools of the
three dragons three boiling caldrons
of white water into which the stream
drops with the fall of a mortar shell
according to u-cham legend it was
here the fifty-three buddhists from
india who introduced their religion into
korea met and overcame three dragons
who lived in deep dens and vanquish-
ing them caused water to flow into their
holes to drown them forever the
drowning potentialities of the pools at
least are patent whatever the truth
about the unwise dragons they fairly
smoke

  the girls chair had drawn abreast
of the first pool yong and i walked
beside it just as the trail turned to
skirt the edge of the second there was
a flash of red against the rocks ahead
as a fox ran from the bushes almost
under our feet he gave a sharp bark
of surprise and disappeared -

  an unearthly yell at my elbow

  i turned to see yong staggering back
as if a bullet had bored his breast his
eyes started from his head his opened
mouth was-cavernous the fingers of
his free hand clawed the air a ter-
rible mask of abject horror

  an instant he stood frozen thus
then he shrieked aloud the hand that
gripped the silk-wrapped seal suddenly
lifted above his head flew outward

  a -square bulk of purple silk soared
in the air caught the sun for a quarter
second then dropped squarely in the
midst of the white froth on the dragons
pool

  the great cardinal seal relic of three
hundred kings disappeared from the
sight of man for all time

  almost before the foam swallowed
the precious crystal yong had whirled
in his tracks and was racing back over

the trail to u-cham-and the world of
living ghosts baron yong once the
cosmospolite and scholar but always the
korean was fleeing the outraged spirits
of kings that spoke through the mouth
of a fox

  ai-ai-ai-yah-h-h-h-h we heard
his retreating cry diminish sink to a
whisper cease

  what remains tobe written

  ah little the world cares naught
for explanations about defeat it is
only the successful who bulk big in the
worlds eyes what the history of
korea might have been-what the
shadow land might be to-day if the
great cardinal seal had not plunged into
the throat of the dragon at keum-kang
san i do not venture to guess perhaps
-perhaps the hazard that youth seized
would have repaid something for the
good of a stricken nation

  as for youths votaries in this little
comedy of the ultimate east the girl
did not even return to seoul she kissed
me as the train was pulling out of kai-
song for the yalu boundary and the
great beyond now she ventures no
more on the rainbow trail i know be-
cause i have a little snapshot picture
of her villa garden near london and
her two fine boys stand with her in the
rose arbor bethell well he slashed
and cut at inevitable destiny until death
put a hand on his pen and he lies some-
where under black cedars where the
walls of seoul climb the heights of puk-
han baron yong is not of the world
either for his head is tonsured and at
dawn when all the bells of u-cham fling
their clangorous voices against the
mountains he stands before the shrine
of three hundred kings and chants
namu-namu amida butsu

  myself why bless your soul i
have five rooms and bath right on the
main perambulator track of brooklyn

a short story you are going to talk about the limelight is on a prize
j fighter but in the lesser light is a hlgh-brow critic who will capture as
much of your attention a man whose muscle had never been tested but
 whose criticism weakened the pugilist as no strong-armed opponent had
ever done

it was dinner time at the training
camp where bunch dorgan was
getting ready to defend the feath-
erweight championship of the
world from the assaults of a tow-
headed swede from st paul

  it was not the coming battle for the
championship that weighed on the
champions mind however he was
watching moose seigel his trainer
moose was engaged in shoveling green
peas into his mouth with a steel knife
he was attacking the difficult feat with
such earnest concentration that his
breath came hard his face was low-
ered to a strategic position about a
foot above his plate and the execution
was appalling

  moose said the champion at last
ill have to hand it to you  youre some
sword swallower

  moose looked up with an embarrassed
grin and said yeh mooses grin
was in itself a remarkable product at
one time he had tried to be a boxer
and there was a gap in the bow of the
boat where his front teeth should have
been

  moose said the champion medita-
tively im going to send you out to
my ranch for a while

  after the fight said moose

  no-before the fight-right now-
this afternoon

  moose dropped the knife with a clat-
ter to his plate whats the matter
wit you  are you crazy  he demanded

  oh kinda crazy said the champion
cheerfully

  aint there goin to be no fight
asked moose in alarm

  sure therell be a fight

  then whos goin to train you fer
it say whats the matter with you
moose had half risen from his chair
in his anxiety

  keep your shirt on said the cham-
pion coolly there aint nothing the
matter wit me my brother arties
coming down from college to stay wit
me while im training for this fight
and if he saw you swallering the table
knives hed faint

  bunch turned with a sort of fierce-
ness on the table lined with trainers
rubbers and preliminary boys i
want to tell you right here and now
that no rough stuff goes when artie
gets here do you get me if any of
youse guys pulls off any rough stuff
around here ill punch a hole through
you the first guy that tries to pull
any off-color stories takes up his traps
and walks-see i aint very strong
high art jnd the low brows



for them myself but arties a high-
brow and nothing like that goes wit
him

  does artie wear a wrist watch
asked moose sourly

  no he dont wear no wrist watch
and he dont wear no coon diamonds
either

  moose hastily pulled down a hairy
paw adorned with a suspiciously lack-
luster jewel and they left the table

  that afternoon moose departed for
the ranch about an hour after artie
arrived artie was a pale timid boy
whose gentle blue eyes looked out
through thick spectaclcs he had come
down from college to work out with
the champion because he was breaking
down from overstudy and thought the
exercise might be mediciue for him

  it hurt bunch to see arties thin
shoulders and his hollow flat chest
when they stripped that afternoon

  dont be afraid hit me hard go
on hit me said bunch when they put
on the gloves in the afternoon

  im hitting you as hard as i can
gasped artie flinging another butterfly
antenna at his brothers tin ear

  bunch confided his troubles to one
of the sporting reporters i got to
have some guy that will give me a real
work-out artie couldnt get a two
weeks old baby into a sweat but the
sight of old moose or any of these
roughneck sparring partners -would kill
artie dead hes a highbrow

  i know just the fellow for you
said the sporting reporter wait and
ill telephone for him

  who is he  asked the champion
suspiciously

  jimmy krantz

  whos timmy krantz who did he
fight 

  dont you know jimmy krantz
hes a big swell his old man is a
millionaire but jimmys a nut on box-
ing hes sore because he cant be
a fighter didnt you read in the pa-

pers how he and that british army
officer had a ten-round go at one of the
country clubs last summer jimmy
knocked him cold you must know
him he says he knows you

  i never pay no attention to them
amateurs but bring him if he can stand
the gaff said bunch

  the next morning bunch dorgans
new training partner arrived in a
twelve-thousand-dollar racing car

  tames warren hereford krantz was
a young man bearing up under the bur-
den of a secret sorrow he felt that
destiny had dealt him a ruthless blow
in planting him in the krantz family as
the only son and heir with a lot of
steamships and banana plantations to
bother about when it might just as well
have let him be champion of the world

  james had a punch in either hand and
the beginning of a cauliflower ear he
had been expelled from three aristo-
cratic boys schools for fighting and the
faculty of his university had lately in-
timated that the dignity of the institu-
tion had not been increased by having
jimmy appear stripped to the waist and
flapping a wet towel as the second of
ad wolgast

  it was a tradition of the krantz
family that the eldest son of each gen-
eration should add to the famous
krantz art collection the prospects
seemed bright that jimmy would add to
that distinguished galaxy the auto-
graphed photograph of every prize
fighter in the ring jimmy also owned
a wonderful collection of sweaters that
had adorned the persons of famous
fighters at crucial periods of their
careers

  bunch welcomed him at once as a
kindred spirit and as jimmy turned
out to be a classmate of arties at col-
lege the addition to the camp seemed
to be a happy one both jimmy and
bunch stood a little in awe of artie

  one day as they were trotting along
a country road muffled up in sweaters


the popular magazine

bunch opened his heart to the scion of
the krantz family

  jimmy he said did you ever hear
of a newspaper guy named cabot

  jimmy gave a grunt that might have
meant anything and trotted manfully
on

  he writes fer the evening star
continued the champion arties a nut
about that paper he reads it all the
time and i guess he says his prayers
to this guy cabot i tried to read it
but its too highbrow for me darnest
paper i ever seen why it dont have
no sporting department i cant under-
stand half the words this cabot guy
writes

  james warren hereford krantz ran
on in silence-a silence that was the
silence of shame he owned the star

  several times after that he noticed
the champion making a painful effort to
read the star but he always tossed it
away in disgust it was a new bond
of sympathy between them the star
was a great source of mortification to
jimmy it had been presented to him
with the idea that it would steady
him the star would steady nearly
anything the star was the kind of
paper delivered at the doors of the re-
spectable rich  its policy was a set-
tled horror of split infinitives and it
spoke severely of the restlessness of the
working classes

  the dramatic editor of the star was
william ellington cabot who artie
said was the dean of american let-
ters

  what does that dean stuff mean 
asked bunch of jimmy krantz

  i guess it means that he is a kind
of champion among the highbrows
replied jimmy in a strained voice he
was anxious to conceal the shameful
fact that he owned a newspaper with-
out a sporting department

  well he must be a bear all right
said the champion respectfully artie
says he is

  in the midst of their training bunch
was asked to appear at a benefit for
the survivors of a shipwreck or a fire
or something they left artie at the
camp and bunch went a couple of
rounds with jimmy krantz it would
have hurt bunchs pride a good deal
had he realized that the millionaire
sparring partner was the real attrac-
tion they were sandwiched in between
a scene from a shakespearian revival
and miss billie burke to bunch it
was a nuisance and a bore

  when they got home artie met them
at the door of the camp his face was
white and set i-i guess ill go back
to college he faltered they saw that
his suit case was packed and standing
beside him

  whats the matter asked bunch
in alarm artie silently held out a copy
of the star

  bunch took the paper and sat down
fearfully on the edge of the porch
jimmy always a tactful boy went on
into the house leaving the two brothers
alone when he came out bunch
looked as white and shaky as artie

  bunch looked up as jimmy came out
and said in a low shamed voice you
telephone that swede that there aint
going to be no fight ill pay him the
forfeit money im going out on the
ranch the lips of the champion be-
gan to quiver for after all he was
only a boy he held out the paper to
jimmy looka here he said look
at what that fellow cabot wrote about
me whatd i ever do to him  and
say whats an abysmal brute thats
what he calls me and bunch began
to cry

ii

 a very angry young man with a
freckled nose sat across the table from
the managing editor of the star james
warren hereford krantz owner of the
journal had called for the purpose of
discharging the dramatic critic
high art and the low brows



  in view of the importance of the oc-
casion he wore the red sweater that
adorned the person of battling nelson
when he fought joe gans at goldfield
it took him some time to decide be
tween that and the sweater worn by
ritchie when he won the championship
from ad wolgast he finally decided
that the nelson garment would be more
terrible

  jimmy could hardly keep back the
tears of rage and mortification as he
drove his motor car down to the star
office which a friendly police officer
had helped him to locate

  do you realize said the managing
editor slowly that william ellington
cabot has been for twenty-five years
one of the foremost shakesperian
scholars in america

  i dont care if he has been the prime
minister of the theater trust for twen-
ty-five centuries screamed jimmy ex-
citedly he called my friend bunch
dorgan an abysmal brute its broken
him all up and hes canceled the
match

  the managing editor bit his lips
who is bunch dorgan

  in his excitement jimmy had half
risen from his chair he sank back
speechless with horror gosh he
said when the power of speech re-
turned to him do you mean to say
you dont know who bunch dorgan is 
youre a whale of an editor dorgan
is the featherweight champion of the
world

  ah said the managing editor
vaguely

  gee wouldnt it scald you  snorted
jimmy all he did was to appear at
an actors benefit and this was what he
got handed to him-an abysmal brute--
in my own paper-just when i was get-
ting in good with the champion it
queered me all right when he found
out i owned the star he wouldnt speak
to me

  after jimmys departure the manag-

ing editor sat for a long time at his
desk dreading what he had to do at
last he slowly climbed the narrow
creaking stairs that led to cabots little
den-one flight about the elevator he
paused for an instant at the threshold
cabot was at work at his desk anni-
hilating a musical show that was defil-
ing the traditions of the drama-and
incidentally earning half a million dol-
lars a year as he wrote he grunted
to himself

  it struck the managing editor for the
first time that cabot had grown to be an
old man the walls of the den were
covered with photographs and it came
to the managing editor that they all be-
longed to a past generation directly
over cabots desk was a picture of mr
william winter the critic and grouped
around it were pictures of joe jefferson
and ristori and rachel there were
no signed photographs of those to
whom the press agents referred as the
reigning favorites

  the managing editor sat down and
hunted helplessly for a way to break
the news to the old man do you re-
member that actors benefit he began
desperately

  i remember that the afternoons en-
tertainment concluded with a slugging
match by a prize fighter said the old
critic sarcastically

  did you-that is did you person-
ally attend the performance asked the
managing editor

  certainly not returned cabot
promptly i have certain ideals of the
drama which i believe i have kept un-
defiled for twenty-five years i do not
intend to descend to dances by bare-
legged women and-

  abysmal brutes murmured the
managing editor in the end his cour-
age failed and he went away to send
the old critic his dismissal by letter

  the incident of his discharge did not
at first impress cabot as having any
very serious consequences to himself


the popular magazine

he left his little den for the last time
with a grim smile he regarded his
retirement as a fitting punishment for
the demoralized star he intended
firmly to decline when the star be-
sought him to return he hadnt the
shadow of a doubt that this humilia-
tion must come to the paper

  he awoke the next morning with an
indescribable feeling of desolation for
thirty years he had risen at eight
breakfasted at eight-thirty and sat
down at his desk at ten he made his
simple toilet for the day with the vague
crippled feeling that a man must have
who resumes his life after losing a
limb he breakfasted at the same place
but it was as though he were starting
on a journey whose destination he did
not know

  before he left the breakfast table
cabot drew up a list of all the papers
he could remember and began crossing
off those which were clearly impossible
to a man of his standing he ruth-
lessly drew his blighting pencil first of
all through the name of the star one
paper he canceled on the ground that it
printed too many illustrations an-
other he doomed on the ground that it
disagreed with his verdict on the last
appearance of henry irving and so on
-the pitiful braggadocio of a worn-out
old man

  that task being completed to his sat-
isfaction mr cabot sauntered out upon
the streets and was presently lost in
his thoughts mechanically he opened
the door of his little den in the star
office he stood horrified in the door-
way for a brisk young man in his
shirt sleeves ws superintending the
work of two porters who were moving
out his furniture

  here cried mr cabot then he
suddenly remembered and withdrew
stumbling out of the room hot with
mortification that he should have for-
gotten

  mr cabot waited a week at his hotel
for the editors to call upon him but
no editors came

  this was a crushing disappointment
mr cabot took the blow as another
evidence of the demoralization of the
times during the weeks of humiliation
that followed cabot went from office
to office murdering his pride the ed-
itors all seemed to him to be half-
fledged boys some of them were po-
litely regretful some of them were
scantily respectful none of them
seemed to have an opening for a
shakespearian purist who spent most
of his time roasting the heavy adver-
tisers

  possibly if you went farther west
- suggested the last editor vaguely

  cabot laughed bitterly why dont
you tell me the truth-that you dont
want me 

  during the nect five or six months
the old man gradually dropped from his
clubs he dropped fromvhis cafe to the
coffeehouses he began studying the
want advertisements in the theatrical
papers he even wrote a note to the
managing editor of the star intimat-
ing that he might be induced to resume
his old place on the paper but the
star had a new dramatic critic-a
young man who wrote stinging para-
graphs about the reigning favorites
sometimes committed slang and was
frankly bored by shakespeare

  finally a new evening paper started
and cabot secured a place by virtue of
the name he had once had in new york
when a new paper starts in a large city
the securing of a position means noth-
ing men are hired and fired al-
most in thesame breath a stream of
ambitious youth marches boldly in at
one door and creeps dejectedly out at
the other a new paper tries them all
the editorial room of a new paper is a
smelter where all the ore offered is
tried out

  it happened that this paper had a
high art and the low brows



particular and special reason for at-
tempting to appeal to conservative peo-
ple and it impressed the managing ed-
itor that the name of cabot would make
a good feature for the opening splash

  cabots first critique written in the
new office was a terrific experience for
him he had a desk out in the edi-
torial room where reporters artists and
editors were all jumbled together the
place seemed to be a madhouse boys
were rushing around his desk with
their hands full of copy and proof
bells were jangling on the editors
desks while over his head came the
steady clattering roar of the linotype
machines it made his head whirl he
couldnt think he could hardly see
every few minutes a young person in
shirt sleeves bustled up to the desk and
ordered him to hurry

  when at length cabot had dribbled
on to the end of it the young man
snatched up the copy from the desk
glanced down a few paragraphs and
said oh hell  in a voice tinctured
with disgust and dismay

  presently the managing editor sent
for mr cabot and explained that the
proprietor of the theater mr cabot was
writing about was to be one of the heav-
iest advertisers

  and you said the managing editor
have simply panned the life out of the
show you might as well understand
right here and now that all this guff
about shakespeare must be canned
we are not trying to elevate the stage
we want some stuff that will make peo-
ple sit up we want something that
will make them say gee whiz when
they open the paper you understand 
girls  girls thats what the public
wants everybody is sick of this high-
brow stuff

  after this experience cabot did not
try any more newspapers some one
persuaded him to start a weekly maga-
zine which should uphold the traditions
of art and the stage

  the magazine-upheld the traditions
of the stage for two months during
which time it devoured the last cent of
cabots savings then it expired and
the traditions of the stage had to stag-
ger on alone

iii

  cabot came at last to a bench in the
park with just half a dollar left in
his pocket his footsteps turned instinc-
tively down the trail of the derelicts
he wandered about looking with dis-
gust at the sleeping bums until at last
he found an empty bench

  directly across the street was a big
lighted pavilion with a squadron of au-
tomobiles standing in front as cabot
timidly sought out the bench a burst
of tumultuous applause surged out from
the pavilion

  it was a prize fight and the feather-
weight champion of the world had gone
down for the count he was on his
hands and knees on the canvas a dull
puzzled look on his young blood-
stained face one of his seconds had
crawled around the edge of the ring
and was throwing water over him with
a sponge entreating him to get up and
fight

  bunch he cried get up hes
counting you out

  the referee holding back an eager
fighter with one hand began to toll off
the seconds

  one-two-three-four-five - six
--seven-eight-nine-

  the champion sighed and tried diz-
zily to get to his feet

  ten--yoirre out cried the referee
a frenzied yell announced a new feath-
erweight champion of the world

  cabot watched for a long time in the
darkness while the crowds left the fight
pavilion the automobiles sputtered
and chuttered and dashed away with a
crisscross of searchlights the street
in front of the pavilion was being
cleared by the police


the popular magazine

  a furious cheer burstfrom those who
lingered as a boy in a sweater hurried
down the front steps and across the
sidewalk to his automobile attended by
a dozen men it was the new cham-
pion of the world as his automobile
whirled away the crowd gave a last
cheer

  the cheer was answered by a sob at
cabots side he turned in surprise to
see a tow-headed boy about twenty
years old with a peanut cap on the
back of his head he had buried his
face in his hands and cabot could see
that his hands were wound with heavy
tape the boys sobs hurt cabot he
wondered if he too were a derelict
it was hard to be a derelict so young
perhaps he was hungry that last half
dollar burned in cabots pocket

  excuse me he said are you
hungry 

  the boy straightened up and wiped
his eyes with his bandaged hands

  i aint hungry he said but i am
everything else you can mark me
present for everything else except
hungry

  cabot was offended and hurt he
withdrew to his end of the bench and
watched the janitors putting out the
lights in the pavilion

  did you see the little argument to-
night asked the boy moodily cabot
pretended not to hear but the boy went
on it was that poke in the stomach
that did it i knew i had got mine
when he handed me that hook in the
refrigerator

  cabot sat for a full minute regarding
the boy with a kind of horror at
length he asked in a strained voice
are you a prize fighter cabots im-
pressions of prize fighters were based
upon illustrations in the old editions of
dickens-human brutes with little pig
eyes

  are you a prize fighter

  bunch dorgan grinned a rueful grin
just about now he said that cheap

skate is sitting around some hotel tell-
ing the sporting reporters that i aint

  after all bunch dorgan was only a
broken-hearted boy of twenty so he
sat on a park bench in the dark and told
his troubles to the shakespearian pur-
ist who raged when frohman put shy-
lock into the wrong kind of shoes

  i wouldnt care so much for m-
self sobbed bunch dorgan its
artie my brother he aint any rough-
neck like me he added warningly
artie is a highbrow

  bunch gulped down a sob and went
on you know were from frisco
i went to school same as artie noth-
ing doing old kid caesar had the
number hung on me before i had gaul
divided into three parts when the
earthquake came it burned my old mans
store and he up and died  my old
man was like artie-classy but he
didnt have no punch after he died
i went to work out in the union iron
works where they built them battle-
ships -

  one night a circus come to town
and a lot of us boys went down the
ringmaster come out and began holler-
ing a lot of bunk about the demon of
the deadly fists who would give any-
body one hundred dollars to stand be-
fore him for one round on the level
mister i dont know what i done it for
but when he said that about the one
hundred dollars i slid down into the
ring and said i would take a chance

the ringmaster he yells beware
boy the sting of death is in every blow

  just then there was a disturbance in
the bleachers my brother artie had
fainted they put the gloves on me
and somebody rung a bell the demon
of the deadly fists came jumping
across the ring at me like a bull buf-
falo i just remember wondering what
would become of artie if he killed me
then i soaked him

  bunch gave a little snicker through
his tears
high art and the low brows

 did you-did he- asked the

critic anxiously

  the next thing i knew said bunch
the demon of the deadly fists was
sprawled out on the mat kicking like a
dying chicken it took five minutes to
bring him to artie was nearly as bad
off

  and then- suggested cabot

  then i became a fighter said
bunch simply artie couldnt never
get used to it when our mother died
i sent artie to college gee that was
all artie was good for he is one of
them pale kids that would sit down in
front of one of king solomons ban-
quets and starve to death because he
didnt have a clean fork i thought
maybe when he got to college the rah-
rah boys and the football lads would
rub some of it off him nothing doing
artie come to a clinch wit a greek dic-
tionary the first day and never let go

  one time i went up to college to
see him artie was a game little sport
and took me around just like i be-
longed but he slips to me please not to
say anything about prize fighting
of course i took a tumble and beat it
too much class for me

  i never could get artie to come
within a mile of a training camp until
last year when i was matched wit a
swede from st paul i got him to
come up and work out wit me for his
health it made me think of back in
frisco when the priest came to make
a parish call i made old moose sei-
gel my trainer run for his life moose
is a good old guy but he aint got no
front teeth and he calls his wife his
rag i told all the guys at the camp
i would beat them to death if they
pulled off any rough stuff wit artie
around

  everything was going great when i
got a roast in a paper that pretty nearly
killed artie there used to be a guy
named william ellington cabot who
wrote theayter news for one of the pa-

pers  artie was nuts over that guy
i guess he thought he invented the dic-
tionary he used to sit around read-
ing this cabots dope all day long

  well you can imagine artie when
this guy cabot comes out in the paper
and calls me an abysmal brute i dont
know what an abysmal brute is but it
was a knock-out for artie he just
turns white and drops the paper he
wouldnt even stay for dinner he just
beats it back for college

 the boy bowed his head in his
hands on the level mister it broke
me all up when i asked artie to come
to my training camp when i was train-
ing for this fight he wouldnt do it
he made some excuse you know how
it is mister when youre training
things get on your nerves believe me
i was all in before i stepped into the
ring to-night that cheap skate over
at the hotel thinks he hung the num-
ber on me it was old kid shake-
speare w cabot that handed me mine
and cost me the championship

  the old critic got shakily to his feet
his face was white and his voice was
trembling my boy he said i am
william ellington cabot

  the old man was tremulously search-
ing his pockets i regret he faltered
that my means of atonement are so
limited i have only this half dollar
left i beg that you will take it it
will save you at least temporarily from
hunger it will- cabots voice be-
came an inaudible mutter

  bunch dorgan had eight thousand
dollars in greenbacks in his pocket--
his end of the purse but with the in-
tuitive tact that sometimes character-
izes men of his class he silently took
the half dollar and put it in his pocket

iv

  a month later the newspaper an-
nounced that bunch dorgan had been
rematched with the new champion of


the popular magazine

 the world but bunch seemed to have
 disappeared from his old haunts
 jimmy krantz hunted him for a week
 and had about given up the search in
 despair when he happened to meet
 bunch on the street his arms were
 loaded with squashy-looking bundles
 one of which was leaking blackberry
 pie

   jimmy screamed with laughter
 bunch dorgans been to a delicacy
 store he yelled

   the dethroned champion shifted his
 bundles and stared at the young man
 sarcastically say thats what i call
 a real joke bunch dorgans been to
 a delicacy store gee but thats funny

 jonest you ought to get that copy-
 righted but take it from me son
 dont go round the corner because
 youll see a whole bunch of people com-
 ing out of a delicacy store and itll be
 so funny it will kill

   the scion of the krantz family in-
 stantly sobered his countenance ex-
 cuse me fee said but ive been look-
 ing for you

   why didnt you inquire at the deli-
 cacy store suggested bunch cut-
 tingly

   jimmy flushed and hesitatingly laid
 his plans before the great man he
 wanted to star the ex-champion in a
 drama

   youre sure to win back the cham-
 pionship he said and we will have
 it all rehearsed and ready to shoot out
 on the road

   whos the sucker thats going to put
 up the money you can be sure i
 aint said bunch suspiciously

   jimmy reddened i-i was going to
 put up the money he said meekly

   what for

   i-i thought i would like to be a
 manager faltered the millionaire

   youre jgood kid said the ex-
 champion relenting a little what am
 i going to play-hamlet

  ill hire some guy to write a play
for you said jimmy joyously

  bunch stopped so suddenly that the
pie fell with a squnch and bled red over
the sidewalk i know the guy that
can do it he cried whereupon he told
jimmy all about his meeting with cabot
on the bench in the park

  ill tell you jimmy he said the
old guy was all in he had just half
a dollar left and when i gets through
telling him the sad story of my life
the old boy shoves me the half and tells
me perhaps it will keep me from get-
ting hungry can you beat that-me
with eight thousand bucks in my pocket
l was afraid id hurt the old mans
feelings so i took the half and we
staked ourselves to the rottenest meal
i ever ate in my life

  i wanted to take him to a hotel but
i couldnt figure how to do it without
getting on his pride so i had to sit up
all night wit him in the park wouldnt
it jar you 

  the next day i put it up to him that
we should both go out to look for work
and split whatever purse we got i
came back that night and let on to him
i had earned two dollars stalling along
that way i managed to get the old man
to resume the eating habit jimmy be-
lieve me he was so hungry he was
weak

  tve been having an awful time
jimmy honest i aint had a square meal
for a month i didnt go too strong on
finding odd jobs and the old boy and i
have been living on tenement-house
diet ive ate so many saratoga chips
i crackle inside looka here

  bunch spread out his bundles on the
curb what do you know about this 
hash ten cents potato salad five
cents succotash five cents pickles
five cents

  why didnt you sneak out and pun-
ish a beefsteak on the side suggested
jimmy

  i thought of that said bunch wist-
high art and the low brows



fully but it didnt seem on the square
o the old boy

  ill take him back on the star  said
jimmy easily

  hed die before he would go back
to your rotten old sheet snorted bunch
indignantly after the way you
treated him you dont know how to
appreciate real class on your paper

  but pleaded jimmy he couldnt
write a play it would queer every-
thing

  all right said bunch decisively
beginning to pick up his bundles

  wait interposed the millionaire in
alarm ill tell you what ill do tell
him to go ahead and write the play
well give it a try-out on the ham route
if it makes a hit ill pay him a thou-
sand dollars for it

  youll pay him a good fat royalty
for it said bunch firmly

  all right then ill pay him a roy-
alty

  the next few weeks were filled with
excitement for bunch and cabot
bunch watched the construction of the
play with awe-but vague dissatisfac-
tion

  its great he said politely but
hadnt you ought to put in something
to make them holler course im a
dub at this game but i should think
you would have me say something
about my poor old gray-haired mother
gimme a speech to say about how id
rather starve in rags than sell my
honor

  cabot smiled pityingly and patted
bunch on the shoulder youre a
kind-hearted lad he said

  meaning back to the timber line for
mine said bunch smiling ruefully
all right air cabot youll have to
excuse me for cutting in wit my rough
stuff

  when it came the duel scene bunch
doggedly rebelled aint there going
to be no fighting he cried in dismay

  certainly retorted the playwright
tartly dont you see the duel

  i know but what do we fight with 
  you fight with rapiers

  whats rapiers

  the rapier began cabot senten-
tiously-the rapier was the sword of
court-the sword of romance-the

sword of honor-the rapier-

  aw nix fer the stickers cried
bunch in alarm i aint no bull-
fighter

  after a long argument cabot surren-
dered i am disappointed in you he
said i had hoped you wtould appre-
ciate the dramatic unities-

  the gang thats going to pay good
money to see me in this play dont want
no dramatic unions said bunch they
want to see me fight

  cabot merely bowed but after that
he spoke of the play with contempt
he read no more of the manuscript
aloud to bunch his ideals had re-
ceived another solar plexus

  in due time bunch delivered the fin-
ished product to jimmy krantz he
tried to bluff it through with an air of
confidence its great dope he said
briskly lots of class you had an
awful nerye to fire the old man why
hes a reglar shakespeare

  jimmy krantz on any subject except
prize fighting was a level-headed young
man he read a few pages of the
script and looked up wildly what
kind of bunk is this you are trying to
shoot at me

  its not bunk its a play replied
bunch stiffly

  gee i should say it is a play said
jimmy sardonically listen to this
and jimmy read aloud a few resound-
ing sentences that sounded like shake-
speare doing his best

  do i have to say that inquired
bunch suspiciously

  you sure do

  bunch stiffened his shoulders well
if its in the play it must be all right


the popular magazine

he said the old guy knows all about
plays

  for the love of mike what do you
know about this snorted jimmy read-
ing on in the manuscript the stage
directions say that the duke is to wear
blue tights and a ruff and a court
sword

 whos the duke asked bunch
weakly

  you are said jimmy with a grin

  bunch wiped the cold perspiration
from his forehead well have you
got any kick against me wearing blue
tights 

  jimmy snickered certainly not
he said youll be a cute chorus girl
agnes

  in the end they conspired against
the duel scene jimmy invented a
somewhat startling scene wherein the
noble duke threw aside his sword and
fought the villain with eight-ounce
gloves

v

  it was arranged that the play should
be tried out at cyclone-a village on
the dog route-without any reporters
around

  while they were engaging the actors
jimmy krantz had a number of fits of
abstracted meditation something was
on his mind he objected to every ac-
tor mentioned for the part of the vil-
lain who was to fight bunch in the play
one was rotten the next  was a
ham and the rest were dubs

  say whats the matter wit you
demanded bunch

  well confessed jimmy i was
just thinking i would like to play that
part myself-just at the try-out you
know

  jimmy said bunch with awful
candor i think ill let you do it id
like to knock your block off you make
me just about that tired

  it was difficult in the circumstances
to say which of the three waited for the

debut of the dukes revenge most
eagerly

  cabot was at last to see on the stage
a play made by his own pen

  no one knew of the manuscripts that
lay rejected and yellow and dust-cov-
ered in his trunk-unrealized dreams
to jimmy it meant a chance to box in
public with a real champion stripped
to the waist and with the plaudits of
the crowd in his ears jimmy was
secretly of the opinion that a new star
of pugilism would be discovered that
night to cyclone it meant a lot of
things-mainly financial

  the fatal night came at last they
rented the town hall and the manager
thereof secured an audience by indus-
triously scattering passes all over town
the place was packed with the hottest
sports on the commuter route by
common consent the middle of the front
row was yielded to the local champion
who worked daytimes in the livery
stable there were two spirited fights
in the hall before the curtain went up
and mike the janitor was wittily
cheered when he came out to trim up
the kerosene lamps music was fur-
nished by the silver cornet band led by
the clerk of the drug store

  the launching of the dukes re-
venge was not auspicious bunch
couldnt get on the blue tights and re-
belled at the rapier say if im a dog
tie a tin can on me he growled but
nix fer this thing it gets down be-
tween my legs

  as they didnt want cabot to see how
they had changed the play they easily
persuaded him to stay out in the lobby
where the nervous strain would not be
so great the old man walked up and
down the foyer biting his nails listen-
ing to the impatient whistles in the hall
im better out here he said i can
tell by the applause whether it suc-
ceeds or not and if they should call

for the author i can be ready ------

the rest died in the old mans throat
high art jnd the low ftcrows



  bunch suddenly dropped his sword
listen jimmy he said if they ap-
plaud youve got to accept the old
mans play

  go on objected jimmy in dis-
may these rubes would yell for a
moving picture of a man eating his
supper

  aw well-all right then he re-
luctantly agreed as bunch began tear-
ing off his sword belt

  as it turned out jimmy was en-
tirely too optimistic about the ap-
plause

  out in the lobby cabot heard the
overture die away with the bass drum
and tuba finishing in a dead heat he
knew the curtain had gone up then
a hush-portentous and dismal

  inside the theater things were going
very badly bunch got his sword tan- 
gled between his legs and fell down
at this a snicker broke out he for-
got his part and stood staring in fas-
cinated horror at jimmy who was try-
ing to prompt him somebody in the
audience meowed like a cat

  gee but this is a dandy play 
whispered jimmy savagely as they
came close together in one of the
scenes

  youd queer any play retorted
bunch

  well youre not so many-stum-
bling over your sword snarled jimmy

  you wait till that fight scene youll
get yours said bunch

  the play was hopelessly floundering
all over the house people were begin-
ning to get up and go out boys in
the gallery began to give catcalls and to
mimic the lines by my faith sir
anthony this is a punk play came in
a shrill falsetto voice from the orches-
tra chairs

  bunch suddenly stopped where he
stood and whispered hoarsely to jim-
my remember if they applaud you
gotta accept the play

  a swell chance sneered jimmy

  bunch turned to the wings and called
to the property man gimme them
gloves

  but what are we going to fight
about i have to insult you first and
then we fight protested jimmy

  hurry up and insult me then said
bunch shortly

  if the audience had been listening at
all they would have been amazed at the
dramatic somersault taken by mr ca-
bot classic one-act drama without
any warning or any reason the duke
and the villain took off their rapiers
laced on boxing gloves and began to
fight

  the audience suddenly sat up and
began to take notice for it didnt look
like a stage boxing match bunchs face
was drawn up into a menacing scowl
he showed his teeth like a wolf the
audience recognized by instinct the
fighting face of the former champion
of the world jimmy recognized it too
somewhat with dismay

  whats the matter he muttered
as bunch lowered his head and tore in
-a vicious little fighting animal but
bunchs only reply was a hard right
swing

  jimmy ducked and backed away he
knew that he either had to jump over
the footlights or make the fight of his
life after all this was the chance he
had been looking for jimmy was a
game boy and real fighting blood
surged through his blue veins he low-
ered his head and made a swipe at the
champion

  out in the foyer cabot enduring
tortures had to clutch the wall to keep
from falling when a mighty cheer and
a roar of applause flooded out to him
he tried to imagine which lines had
swept them off their feet but before
he could make up his mind a fresh and
louder gust roared out to him

where ate they now he cried to
the doorkeeper but the doorkeeper
had rushed headlong back into the
the popular magazine

house and cabot was bumped back out
of the way by a rush of the departing
audience trying to get back into the
house

  could cabot have forced his way
into the theater he would have seen a
very sick little millionaire taking the
count with bunch standing grimly over
him waiting for him to get up got
enough whispered bunch but jim-
mys only reply was to get dizzily to his
feet and make a blind headlong sav-
age rush at bunch

  he could only see dimly the half-
naked body of the boy in front of him
but jimmy was game

  give him the scissors blow yelled
some one in the crowd the audience
answered the voice with a roar give
him the scissors blow

  a hard glitter came into bunch dor-
gans eyes his head lowered a lit-
tle his arms hung poised like the
bodies of two snakes about to strike
as he walked forward to meet jimmys
rush he rocked with a curious shuffle
it was the walk of a jungle animal
ready to dodge in any direction

  centuries had been swept aside
jimmy krantz was rushing upon the
naked strength and brute skill of a
paleolithic cave man bunch had sud-
denly taken up the inheritance of his an-
cestors who swung from trees and
killed their enemies with their bare
hands

  his little half-shut eyes ran over the
boys body coldly and critically like a
connoisseur with a stabbing vicious
motion the heel of his left fist dug down
into the bare white body a little be-
low the armpit and about an inch for-
ward bunch had planted his famous
scissors blow a look of bewildered
pain-a dull puzzled look came into
jimmys eyes

  out in the foyer cabots senses
reeled before the cyclone of applause
the place began whirling about the
old man had fainted while the box-

  office clerks were dashing about throw-
ing water in his face the stage hands
were waving smelling salts beneath the
nostrils of a dreadfully ill little mil-
lionaire jimmy had taken the count

  as his eyelids fluttered and the color
came back to his face bunch bent over
him and said sociably well they ap-
plauded jimmy you got to take the old
mans play

vi

  two weeks later bunch dorgan won
back the featherweight championship of
the world after the fight he sat with
a hack writer at a table in the back of
a big cafe

  i want you to write me a play where
somebody makes a crack about my poor
old gray-haired mother and i punch his
noodle i dont want nothing to say-
unless you might have me say id
rather starve in rags than sell my
honor or something like that yunder-
stand but no long speeches about the
soul of st anthony and say the
name of this piece has got to be the
dukes revenge 

  whats a duke got to do with it
asked the bewildered writer

  never mind if im payin fer this
piece i can call it the dukes revenge
if i want to cant i 

  sure you can call it the mud
turtles romance if you want to but
you dont need to get sore about it

  my young friend said cabot one
day to artie it is a mistake to sup-
pose that the masses do not appreciate
the drama constructed along classical
lines i may mention-ahem-as a case
in point my own trifle-the dukes
revenge now on the road

  quite a curious instance i may say
though i have been drawing a royalty
-i may say a handsome royalty-this
long time i have never seen my own
play acted your brother says he could
not act if i were in the audience

by frank l packard
author of  owsley and the  ilrat river specialm etc

    despite our talk of peace we love a fighter the man who sets himself
a task and to achieve it is ready to grapple with death itself packard has
told us of some of the heroes of the hill division hard-tongued hard-fisted
hard-faced rough without much polish perhaps as some rank polish hue
with hearts thac are right and big as a womans fighters all doing a
heros work as any soldier fighting for his flag on the battlefields of
europe this is a story of one of the gallant fellows who had passed the
age limit-and the telling is as though men stood erect bareheaded at
salute to the passing of the old guard

as its scarred and battle-torn col-
ors are the glory of a regiment
brave testimony of hard-fought
fields where men were men so
to the hill division is its tradition and
there are names there too on the honor
roll-not famous not world-wide not
on every tongue butnames that in rail-
roading will never die the years have
gone since men fought and conquered
the sullen gray-walled rockies and
shackled them with steel and iron and
laid their lives on the altar of one of
the mightiest engineering triumphs the
world has ever known but the years
have dimmed no memory have only
brought achievement into clearer focus
and honor to its fullness where honor
is due they tell the stories of those
days yet as they always will tell them
-at night in the roundhouse over the
soft pur of steam with the yellow
flicker of the oil lamps on the group
clustered around the pilot of a -
class mountain greyhound-and the tell-
ing is as though men stood erect bare-
headed at salute to the passing of
the old guard

  heroes they never called them-
selves that-never thought of them-
selves in that way those old fellows
who have left their stories their uni-
form was a suit of overalls their dec-
orations the grime that came with the
days work-just railroad men hard-
tongued hard-fisted hard-faced rough
without much polish perhaps as some
rank polish with hearts that were right
and big as a womans-that was all

  maccaffery was one of these and
this is old dan maccafferys story in
the days when royal carleton sat
in the swivel chair in the superintend-
ents office when regan stumpy fat
big-hearted tommy regan was mas-
ter mechanic when harvey was divi-
sion engineer when riley was trans-
mitter and donkin was chief dis-
patcher pretty good railroaders that
little crowd there will never be better
some of them have gone up way up
to the heads of systems and some of
them have gone into division for the
last time on orders from the great
trainmaster

  maccaffery dan was an engineer


the popular magazine

one of the old-timers blue-eyed thin
-but youd never get old dan that
way  he wouldnt look natural youve
got to put him in the cab of the 
leaning out of the window way out
thin as a bent toothpick and pounding
down the gorge and around into the
straight making for the big cloud
yards with a string of buff-colored
coaches jouncing after him and him-
self bouncing up and down in his seat
like an animated piece of rubber no-
body ever saw old dan inside the cab
that is all in he always had his head
out of the window said he could see
better though the wind used to send
the water trickling down from the old
blue eyes and generally there were
two little white streaks on his cheeks
where no grime or coal dust ever got a
chance at a strangle hold on the skin
crevices for the rest what you could
see sticking out of the cab over the
whirling rod as he came down the
straight was just a black greasy
peaked cap surmounting a scanty
fringe of gray hair and a wizened
face with a round little knob in the
center of it for a nose

  but that isnt altogether old dan
maccaffery either there was mrs
maccaffery everybody liked dan
with his smile and the cheery way he
had of puckering up his lips sympa-
thetically and pushing back his cap
and scratching near his ear where the
hair was as he listened maybe to a
hard-luck story everybody liked dan-
but they swore by mrs maccaffery
leaving out the railroaders who wor-
shiped her anyway even the worst
characters in big cloud and there wrere
some pretty bad ones in those early
days hangers-on and touts for the
gambling hells and dives used to speak
of the little old lady in the lace cap
with a sort of veneration

  there was something patrician about
mrs maccaffery not the cold stand-
offish effect thats only make-believe

but the real thing the lord knows
she had to work hard enough but you
never saw her rinsing the washtub suds
from her hands and coming to the door
with her sleeves rolled up the last
thing youd ever think there was in the
house was a washtub little lace cap
over smoothly parted gray hair little
black dress with a little white frill
around the throat and just a glad look
on her face whether shed ever seen
you before or not-that was mrs mac-
caffery

  as far back as any one could re-
member she had always looked like
that always a little old lady-never a
young woman although she and dan
had come there years before even be-
fore the operating department had grot
the steel shaken down into anything that
might with justice be called a perma-
nent right of way perhaps it was the
gray hair-mrs maccafferys hair had
been gray then when it ought to have
been the glossy luxuriant brown that
the old-fashioned daguerreotype hang-
ing in the shantys combination dining
and sitting room proclaimed that it once
was

  big cloud of course didnt call her
patrician because they didnt talk that
way out there they said there was
some class to mrs maccaffery not
that they ranked her any finer than dan
for the last one of them ranked dan
as one of gods own noblemen and
theres nothing finer than that only they
figured at least the women did that
back in the old country shed been
brought up to things that dan maccaf-
fery hadnt

  maybe that accounted for their send-
ing young daii east and pinching them-
selves pretty near down to bed rock to
give the boy an education and a start
not that mrs maccaffery had any no-
tions that railroading and overalls and
dirt was plebeian and beneath her-far
from it she was proud of old dan
proud of his work proud of his rec-
the age limit



ord shed talk about dans engine to
you by the hour just as though it were
alive just as dan would and she would
have hung chintz curtains on the cab
windows and put flowerpots on the
running boards if they had let her -it
wasnt that mrs maccaffery wasnt
that kind only there wtere limitations
to a cab and she didnt want the boy
-he was the only one they had-to
start out with limitations of any kind
that would put a slow order on his
reaching the goal her mothers heart
dreamed of what goal  who knows 
mothers always dream of their boys
future in that gentle loving all-con-
quering up-in-the-clouds kind of a way
dont they  she wanted young dan to
do something make a name for himself
some day

  and young dan did he handed a
jolt to the theory of heredity that
should if it didnt have sent the dis-
ciples of that creed to the mat for the
full count when he got through his
education he got into a bank and backed
the brain development the old couple
had scrimped to the bone to give him
against the market-with ten thousand
dollars of the banks money old dan
and mrs maccaffery got him off-mrs
maccaffery with her sweet old face
and dan with his grim old honesty
the bank didnt prosecute the boy
was drowned in a ferryboat accident
the year after and old dan had been
paying up ever since

  he was always paying up ten thou-
sand dollars even in a whole lot of
yeary installments didnt leave much
to come and go on from his monthly
pay check he talked some of dropping
the benefit orders he belonged to and
he belonged to most of them but mrs
maccaffery talked him out of that on
account of the insurance she said but
really because she knew that dan and
his lodge rooms and his regalias and
his worshipful titles were just part and
parcel of each other and that he either

was or was just going to be supreme
high chief illustrious something-or-
other of every order in town besides
after all it didnt cost much compared
with the other just meant pinching a
tiny bit harder and so they pinched

  old dan and mrs maccaffery didnt
talk about their troubles youd never
get the blues on their account no mat-
ter how intimate you got with them
but everybody knew the story of
course for everybody knows a thing
like that and everybody knew that dol-
lars were scarce up at the maccafferys
shanty for though they didnt know
how much old dan sent east each year
they knew it had to be a pretty big slice
of what was coming to him to make
much impression on that ten thousand
dollars at the other end-and they won-
dered naturally enough how the mac-
cafferys got along at all but the mac-
cafferys got along somehow outwardly
without a sign of the hurt that was
deeper than a mere matter of dollars
and cents

  dan was handling the cab end of one
of the local passenger runs when things
broke loose in the east-a flurry in
wall street but wall street wras a
long long way from the rockies and
though the papers were full of it there
didnt seem to be anything intimate
enough in a battle of brokers and mag-
nates bitter prolonged and to the death
though it might be to stir up any ex-
citement or enthusiasm on the hill di-
vision but when the smoke cleared
away down east the hill division and
big cloud forgot their bridge troubles
and their washouts and their slides long
enough to stick their tongues in their
cheeks and look askance at each other
and carleton the superintendent in his
swivel chair pulled on the amber
mouthpiece of his brier and looked at
tommy regan the master mechanic
who in turn pulled on his scraggly
brown mustache and reached for his hip


the popular magazine

pocket and his plug the system was
under new control

 whos h herrington campbell
when hes at home spluttered regan

  our new general manager tommy
carleton told him for the second time

  regan grunted t aint blind ive
read that much who is he-hm
know him 

  carleton took the pipe from his
mouth-a little seriously its the p
m  k crowd tommy makes quite
an amalgamation doesnt it  direct
eastern tidewater connection-what
theyre a younger lot pretty progres-
sive too and sharp as they make them
i dont care a tinkers hoot who
owns the stock observed regan bit-
ing deeply at his blackstrap its the
bucko with the overgrown name in the
center that interests me-whos he do
you know him 

  yes said carleton slowly i
know him he got up suddenly and
walked over to the window looked out
into the yards for a moment then
turned to face the master mechanic i
know him and i know most of the
ethers and ill say between you and
me tommy that im blamed sorry
theyve got their fingers on the old road
theyre a cold money-grabbing crew
and campbells about as human as a
snow man only not so warm-blooded
i fancy youll see some changes out
here

  i turned down an offer from the
penn last week said the fat little mas-
ter mechanic reminiscently mabbe i

ought-

  carleton laughed-he could afford to
there was hardly a road in the country
that hadnt majde covetous offers for the
services of the gray-eyed master of the
hill division who was the idol of his
men down to the last car tink

 no i guess not tommy our
heads are safe enough i think when
i go you go and as the p m  k
have been after me before i guess

theyll let me alone now im on their
pay roll

  what kind of changes then in-
quired regan gruffly

  i dont know said carleton i
dont know tommy-new crowd new
ways well see

  and in time regan saw perhaps
regan himself together with riley the
trainmaster were unwittingly the means
of bringing it about a little sooner than
it might otherwise have come per-
haps not ultimately it would have been
all the same sentiment and h her-
rington campbell were not on speaking
terms however one way or the other
in results it makes little difference

  it was natural enough that about the
first official act of the new board was a
trip to look over the new property it
had acquired and if there was any re-
sentment on the hill division at the
change in ownership there was no sign
of it in big cloud when the word went
out of what was coming on the con-
trary everybody sort of figured to make
a kind of holiday affair of it for the
special was to lay off there until after-
noon to give the big fellows a chance
to see the shops anyway it was more
or less mutually understood that they
were to be given the best the hill divi-
sion had to offer

  regan kept his pet flyer the  in
the roundhouse and tinkered over her
for two days and sent for dan mac-
caffery thered been a good deal of
speculation among the engine crews as
to who would get the run and the men
were hot for the honor

  regan squinted at old dan and
squinted at the  on the pit beside
him

  how dyou think she looks dan
he inquired casually

  the old engineer ran his eyes wist-
fully over the big racer groomed to the
minute like the thoroughbred it was

  shell do you proud regan he
said simply
the age limit



  and then regans fat little hand came
down with a bang on the others over-
alled shoulder that was regans way

  and you too dan he grinned i
got you slated for the run

  me said maccaffery his wizened
face lighting up

 you-sure regans grin ex-
panded its coming to you aint it
youre the senior engineer on the divi-
sion aint you well then whats the
matter with you rileys doing the
same for pete chartrand hes putting
pete in the aisles what

  old dan looked at regan then at the
 and back at regan again

  say he said a little huskily the
missusll be pleased when i tell her
we was talking it over last night and
hoping-just hoping mind you-that

mabbe-

  go tell her then said the little mas-
ter mechanic who didnt need any word
picture to make him see mrs maccaf-
ferys face when she heard the news
and he gave the engineer a friendly
push doorward

  not a very big thing to pull the latch
of the directors special nothing to
make a fuss over well no perhaps
not not unless you were a railroad man
it meant quite a bit to dan maccaffery
though and quite a bit to mrs mac-
caffery because it was an honor com-
ing to dan and it meant something to
regan too call it a little thing but
little things count a whole lot some-
times

  there had been a sort of little pro-
gram mapped out regan as naturally
fell to his lot being master mechanic
was to do the honors of the shops and
carleton was to make the run up
through the rockies and over the divi-
sion with the new directors but at the
last momenta telegram sent the super-
intendent flying east to a brothers sick
bed and the whole kit and caboodle of
the honors to his inward consternation
and dismay fell to regan

  regan however did the best he
could he fished out the black sunday
suit he wore on the rare occasions when
he had time to knowt one day of the
week from the other wriggled into a
boiled shirt and a stiff collar that was
yellow for want of daylight and nerv-
ous as a galvanic battery was down on
the platform an hour before the train
was due also by the time the train
rolled in regans handkerchief avas
wringing wet from the sweat he mopped
off his forehead but five minutes after
that the earnest little master mechanic
as he afterward confided to carleton
wouldnt have given a whoop for two
trainloads of em let alone the measly
lot you could crowtd into one private
car somehow regan had got it into
his head that he was going on his mettle
before a crowd of up-to-the-minute
way-up railroaders but when he found
there wasnt a practical railroad man
among them bar h herrington camp-
bell to whom he promptly and whole-
heartedly took a dislike regan experi-
enced a sort of pitying contempt which
if it passed over the nabobs heads with-
out doing them any harm had at least
the effect of putting the fat little mas-
ter mechanic almost superciliously at his
ease

  inspect the shops not at all they
were out for a joy ride across the con-
tinent and the fun there was in it

 how long we got here three
hours wow boomed a big fellow
stretching his arms lazily as he gazed
about him

  lets paint the town boys wheezed
an asthmatic bowlegged little man of
fifty who sported an enormous gold
watch chain come on and look the
natives over

  regan who had been a little hazy
on the etiquette of chewing in select
company reached openly for his plug
and kind of squinted over it noncommit-
tingly as he bit in at h herrington
campbell who stood beside him carle-


the pocpuljlcr magazine

ton had sized the new general manager
up pretty well-cold as a snow man-
and he looked it a spare-built man
with sharp quick black eyes a face
like a hawk and lips so thin you
wouldnt know he had any if one cor-
ner of his mouth hadnt been pried kind
of open so to speak with the stub of
a cigar

  go ahead and amuse yourselves
boys h herrington campbell talked
out of the corner of his mouth where
the cigar was we pull out at twelve-
thirty sharp then to regan curtly
well look the equipment and shops
over mr regan

  yes-sure agreed regan without
much enthusiasm and led the way
across the tracks toward the round-
house as a starting point for the inspec-
tion tour

  the whole blamed thing was different
from the way regan had figured it out
in his mind beforehand but regan set
out to make himself agreeable and h
herrington campbell listened h her-
rington campbell was the greatest lis-
tener regan had ever met and regan
froze-and then regan thawed out
again but not on account of h her-
rington campbell regan might have
an unresponsive audience but then re-
gan didnt require an audience at all
to warm him up when it came to his
roundhouse and his big mountain
racers and the shops he lay awake at
night planning and thinking about here
and there h herrington campbell shot
out a question crisp incisive unex-
pected and lapsed into silence again-
that was all

  they inspected everything every-
thing there was to inspect but when
they got through regan had about as
good an idea of what impression it had
made on h herrington campbell as
he had when he started out which is
to say none at all the new general
manager just listened regan did the
talking

  not that h herrington campbell
sized up as a misfit not by any means
far from it regan didnt make that
mistake for a minute he didnt need
to be told that the other knew railroad-
ing from the ground up he could feel
it but he didnt need to be told either
that the other was more a high-geared
efficiency machine than he was a man
he could feel that too

  one word of praise regan wanted
not for himself but for the things he
loved and worked over and gave his
soul to and the one word where a
thousand were due regan did not get
the new general manager had the emo-
tional instincts of a wooden indian re-
gan toward the end of the morning got
to talking a little less himself-that is
aloud inwardly he grew more eloquent
than ever cholerically so

  it was train time when they had fin-
ished and the  with old dan mac-
caffery half out of the cab window
as usual had just backed down and
coupled onto the special as regan and
the new general manager came along the
platform from the upper freight sheds
and regan for all his inward spleen
couldnt help it as they reached the big
powerful racer spick and span from the
guard plates up

  i dunno where youll beat that east
or west said regan proudly with a
wave of his hand at the  wish we
had more of that type out here we
could use em what do you think of
her mr campbell-hm

  h herrington campbell didnt ap-
pear to take any notice of the master-
piece of machine design to speak of
his eyes traveled over the engine and
fixed on dan maccaffery in the cab
window dan had an old but spotless
suit of overalls on spotless because
mrs maccaffery who was even then
modestly sharing her husbands honors
from the back of the crowd by the tick-
et-office window had made them spot-
less with a good many hours work
the age limit



for grease sticks hard even in a wash-
tub the da before and on old dans
wizened face was a genial smile that
would have got an instant response
from anybody-except h herrington
campbell h herrington campbell
didnt smile neither did he answer re-
gans question

  how old are you said he bluntly
to dan maccaffrey

  me  said old dan taken aback for
a moment then he laughed blest
if i know sir its so long since ive kept
track of birthdays sixty-one i guess
-no sixty-two

  h herrington campbell didnt ap-
pear to hear the old engineers answer
any more than he had appeared to take
any notice of the  he had barely
paused in his walk and he was pulling
out his watch now and looking at it as
he continued along-only to glance up
again as pete chartrand the senior
conductor gray-haired gray-bearded
but clapper as you please in his blite
uniform and brass buttons hurried by
toward the cab with the green tissue
copy of the engineers orders in his
hand

  regan opened his mouth to say some-
thing-and instead snapped his jaws
shut like a steel trap the last little
bit of enthusiasm had oozed out of the
usually good-natured little master me-
chanic two days tinkering with the
 the division all keyed up to a smile
everybody trying to do his best to
please a dozen little intimate plans and
arrangements talked over and worked
out were all now a matter of earnest
and savage regret to regan

  by christmas growled regan to
himself as he elbowed his way through
the crowd on the platform-for the
town to the last squaw with a papoose
strapped on her back had turned out
to see the directors special off--by
christmas if twere not for carletons
sake id tell him the tittle tin god that
he thinks he is what i think of him

and mabbe added regan viciously
as he swung onto the observation be-
hind h herrington campbell and
mabbe i will yet

  but regans cup brimming as he held
it to be was not yet full it was a
pretty swell train the directors spe-
cial that the crowd sent off with a burst
of cheering that lasted until the mark-
ers were lost to view around a bulte
a pretty swell train about the swdiest
that had ever decorated the train sheet
of the hill division two sleepers a
diner and observation mostly mahog-
any and the baggage car a good enough
imitation to fit into the color scheme
without outraging even the most es-
thetic taste and the  on the front
end gold-leafed and shining like a mir-
ror from polished steel and brass

  as far as looks went there wasnt a
thing the matter with it not a thing
it would have pulled a grin of pride out
of a polack section hand-which is pull-
ing some and there wasnt anything
the matter with the send-off either that
was propitious enough to satisfy any-
body but for all that barring the first
hour or so out of big cloud trouble
and the directors special that after-
noon were as near akin as twin brothers

  nothing went right everything went
wrong-except the  that ran as
smooth as a full-jeweled watch when
old dan for the mix-up behind him
could run her at all the coupling on
the diner broke that started it when
they got that fixed something else hap-
pened  and then the forward truck of
the baggage car developed a virulent
attack of hot box

  the special had the track swept for
her clean to the western foothills and
rights through but she didnt need
them her progress was a crawl the
directors in spite of their dollar-ante
and the roof of the observation car for
the limit began to lose interest in their
game 

  what is this new toy weve bought 


the popular magazine

inquired one of them plaintively a
funeral procession

  even h herrington campbell began
to show emotion he shifted his cigar
stub at intervals from one corner of
his mouth to the other regan was hot
-both ways-inside and out hotter a
whole lot than the hot box he took his
coat oft to and helped old pete char-
trand and the train crew slosh buckets
of water over every time the directors
special stopped which was frequently

  it wasnt old petes fault it wasnt
anybodys fault it was just blamed
hard luck and it lasted through the
whole blamed afternoon and by the
time they pulled into elk river where
regan had wired for another car and
had transferred the baggage the direc-
tors special as far as temper went was
as touchy as a man with a bad case of
gout as they coupled on the new car
regan spoke to old dan in the cab--
spoke from his heart

  were two hours late dan-hm
for the love of mike let her out and
do something that bunch back theres
getting so polite to me youd think the
words would melt in their mouths--
what

  old dan puckered his face into a re-
assuring smile under the peak of his
greasy cap

  i guess were all right now weve got
rid of that car he said you leave
it to me you leave it to me regan
pete chartrand savage as though the
whole matter were a personal and di-
rect affront reached up with a new tis-
sue to the cab window

  two hours and ten minutes late
he snapped out nice aint it di-
rectors special all the swells were
doing ourselves proud  oh thunder
keep your shirt on pete said re-
gan somewhat consistently losing
your hair over it wont do anr good
youre not to blame are you well
then forget it

  two hours and ten minutes late bad

enough but in itself nothing disas-
trous it wasnt the first time in rail-
roading that schedules had gone aglim-
mering only there was more to it than
that there were not a few other trains
fast freights passengers locals and
work trains whose movements and the
movements of the directors special
were intimately connected one with the
other two hours and ten minutes was
sufficient a whole lot more than suffi-
cient to play havoc with a dispatchers
carefully planned meeting points over a
hundred miles of right of way and all
afternoon donkin had been chewing his
lips oyer his train sheet back in the dis-
patchers office at big cloud until the
directors special officially special 
had become a nightmare to him or-
ders counter orders cancellations new
orders had followed each other all after-
noon and now a new batch went out
as the rehabilitated special went out of
elk river and donkin with a sigh of
relief at the prospect of clear sailing
ahead pushed the hair out of his eyes
and relaxed a little as he began to give
back the completes

  it wasnt donkins fault there was
never so much as a hint that it wras
the day man at mitre peak-forgot
thats all-but its a hard word the
hardest there is in railroading there
was a lot of traffic moving that after-
noon and with sections regulars and
extras all trying to dodge special 
they were crowding each other pretty
hard-and the day man at mitre peak
forgot

  it was edging dusk as old pete char-
trand from the elk river platform
lifted a finger to old dan maccaffery
in the cab and old dan with a sort of
grim smile at the knowledge that the
honor of the hill division what there
was left of it as far as special  was
concerned was up to him opened out
the  to take the rights theyd given
him afresh for all there was in it

  from elk river to mitre peak
the age limit



where the right of way crosses the di-
vide it is a fairly stiff climb from
mitre peak to glacier at the canon bed
it is an equally emphatic drop and the
track in its gyrations around the base
of the towering jutting peaks where it
clings as a fly clings to a wall is an
endless succession of short tangents and
shorter curves the rockies had been
subjected but they had never been
tamed-nor ever will be silent brood-
ing always there seems a sullen pa-
tience about them as though they were
waiting warily-to strike there are
stretches many of them where no more
than a hundred yards will blot utterly
one train from the sight of another
where the thundering reverberations of
the one flung echoing back and forth
from peak to peak drown utterly the
sounds of the other and west of
mitre peak it is like this-and the oper-
ator at mitre peak forgot the holding
order for extra freight no 

   it came quick quick as the winking
 of an eye sudden as the crack of doom
 extra freight no  was running
 west too in the same direction as the
 directors special only extra no

  g was a heavy train and she was creep-
 ing down the grade like a snail while
 the directors special with the spur and
 prod of her own delinquency and mis-
 behavior was hitting up the fastest clip
 that old dan who knew every inch of
 the road with his eyes shut dared to
 give within the limits of safety on that
 particular piece of track

   it came quick ten yards clear on
the right of way then a gray wall of
rock a short right-angled dive of the
track around it-and as the pilot of
the  nosed the curve old dans heart
for an instant stopped its beat three
red lights focvised themselves before his
eyes the tail lights on the caboose of
extra no  there was a yell
from little billy dawes his fireman

  dan-dan were into her dawes
yelled were into her

  cool old veteran one of the best that
ever pulled a throttle in any cab there
was a queer smile on old dan maccaf-
ferys lips he needed no telling that
disaster he could not avert could only
in a measure mitigate perhaps was
upon them but even as he checked
checked hard and checked again the
thought of others was uppermost in his
mind-the train crew of the freight
some of them anyway in the caboose
dawes was beside him now almost at
his elbow nervy and full of grit as the
engineer hed shoveled for for five years
and thought more of than he did of any
other man on earth-and for the frac-
tion of a second old dan maccaffery
looked into the others eyes

  give the boys in the caboose a
chance for their lives billy in case
they aint seen or heard us he shouted
in his firemans ear hold that whistle
lever down

  twenty yards fifteen between them
-the  in the reverse bucking like a
maddened broncho old dan working
with all the craft he knew at his levers
-ten yards-and two men scurrying
like rats from a sinking ship leaped
from the tail of the caboose to the right
of way

  jump the word came like a half
sob from old dan there was nothing
more that any man could do and he
followed his fireman through the gang-
way

  it made a mess-a nasty mess from
the standpoint of traffic as nasty a mess
as the hill division had ever faced
the rear of the freight went to match-
wood the  the baggage and two
pullmans turned turtle derailing the
remaining cars behind but by a mir-
acle it seemed there wasnt any one
seriously hurt

  scared yes-pretty badly the di-
rectors a shaken white-lipped crowd
poured out of the observation car to the
track side there was no cigar in h
herrington campbells mouth


the popular magazine

  it was dark by then but the wreck-
age caught fire and flung a yellow glow
far across the canon and in a shadowy
way lighted up the immediate surround-
ings train crews and engine crews
of both trains hurried here and there
torches and lanterns began to splutter
and wink hoarse shouts began to echo
back and forth adding their quota to
a weird medley of escaping steam and
crackling flame

  regan from a hasty consultation with
old dan maccaffery and old pete char-
trand that sent the two men on the
jump to carry out his orders turned-
to face h herrington campbell

 nobody hurt sir-thank god
puffed the fat little master mechanic
in honest relief

  h herrington campbells eyes were
on the retreating forms of the engi-
neer and conductor

  oh indeed he said coldly and
the whole affair is hardly worth men-
tioning i take it-quite a common oc-
currence youve got some pretty old
men handling your trains out here
havent you 

  regans face went hard

  theyre pretty good men he said
shortly and theres no blame com-
ing to them for this mr campbell if
thats what you mean

  h herrington campbells fingers
went tentatively to his vest pocket for
a cigar extracted the broken remains of
one-the relic of his own collision with
the back of a car seat where the smash
had hurled him-and threw it away
with an icy smile

  blame  expostulated h herring-
ton campbell ironically i dont want
to blame any one im looking for some
one to congratulate- the worst run
division and the most pitiful exempli-
fication of near-railroading ive had any
experience with in twenty years-mr
regan

  for a full minute regan did not
speak he couldnt and then the

words came away with a roar from the
bluff little master mechanic

  by glory he exploded we dont
take that kind of talk out here even
from general managers wre dont have
to thats straight enough aint it
well ill give you some more of it
now ive started i dont like you i
dont like that pained look on your
face ive been filling up on you all
morning and you dont digest well we
dont stand for anything as raw as that
from any man on earth and you
neednt hunt around for any greased
words as far as im concerned to do
your firing with you can have my res-
ignation as master mechanic of the
worst run division youve seen in twenty
years right now if you want it-hm

  h herrington campbell was gal-
lantly preoccupied

  how long are we stalled here for-
the rest of the night he inquired ir-
relevantly

  regan stared at him a moment-still
apoplectic

  ive ordered them to run the for-
ward end of the freight to glacier and
take you down he said choking a lit-
tle theres a couple of flats left whole
that you can pile yourselves and your
baggage onto and down at glacier
theyll make up a new train for you

  oh very good said h herrington
campbell curtly

  and ten minutes later the directors
special metamorphosed into a string of
box cars with two flats trailing on the
rear on which the newly elected board
of the transcontinental sat some on
their baggage and some with their legs
hanging over the sides pulled away
from the wreck and headed down the
grade for glacier funny the transi-
tion from the luxurious leather uphol-
stery of the observation to an angry
chattering mob of magnates clinging to
each others necks over the jouncing
on the flooring of an old flat well
perhaps-it depended on how you look
the age limit



at it regan looked at it-and regan
grinned for the savagery that was in
him

  but i guess said regan to himself
as he watched them go i guess mabbe
ill be looking for that job on the penn
after all-hm

  eveiybody talked about the directors
special run-naturally and naturally
everybody wrondered what was going
to come from it it was an open secret
that regan had handed one to the gen-
eral manager without candy coating on
the pill and the hill division sort of
looked to see the master mechanics
head fall and regan go but regan did
not go and for that matter nothing
else happened-for a while

  carleton came back and got the rights
of it from regan-and said nothing to
regan about his reply to h herrington
campbells letter in which he had stated
that if they were looking for a new mas-
ter mechanic there would be a division
superintendency vacant at the same
time the day man at mitre peak quit
railroading-without waiting for an in-
vestigation old dan maccaffery and
billy dawes went back to their regular
run with the  and the division gen-
erally settled down again to its daily
routine-and from the perspective of
distance if the truth be told got to
grinning reminiscently at the run the
big bugs had had for their money

  only the grin came too soon

  a week or so passed pay day came
and went and the day after that a
general order from the east hit the hill
division like a landslide

  carleton slit the innocent-looking of-
ficial manilla open with his paper knife
chucked the envelope in the wastebas-
ket read the communication read it
again with gathering brows-and sent
for regan he handed the form to the
master mechanic without a word as the
latter entered the office

  regan read it-read it again as his
chief had-and two hectic spots grew

bright on his cheeks it was brief curt
cold-for the good of the service safety
and operating efficiency it stated in
a word on and after the first of the
month the services of employees over
the age of sixty years would no longer
be required those were early days in
railroading not a word about pensions
not a word about half pay just sixty
years and-out

  the paper crackled in regans
clenched fist carleton was beating a
tattoo on his teeth with the mouthpiece
of his pipe there wasnt another
sound in the office for a moment then
regan spoke-and his voice broke a
little

  its a damned shame he said
through his teeth its that skunk
campbell

  how many men does it affect 
asked carleton looking through the
window

  i dont know said the little master
mechanic bitterly but i know one that
itll hit harder than all the rest put to-
gether-and thats old dan maccaf-
fery

  there was hurt in the supers gray
eyes as he looked at the big-hearted lit-
tle master mechanics working face

  i was thinking of old dan myself
he said in his low quiet way

  he hasnt a cent stormed regan
not a cent-not a thing on earth to
fall back on think of it him and
that little old missus of his god bless
her sweet old face that have been
scrimping all these years to pay back
what that blasted kid robbed out of the
bank it aint right carleton sixty
years there aint a better man ever
pulled a latch in a cab there aint a bet-
ter one pulling one anywhere to-day
than old dan maccaffery and-and
i kind of feel as though i were to blame
for this in a way

  to blame repeated carleton

  i put him on that run and riley
put old pete chartrand on it kind of


the populacr magazine

stuck them under campbells nose the
two of them together the two oldest
men-and the blamedest luck that ever
happened on a run

  carleton shook his head i dont
think it would have made any differ-
ence in the long run tommy i told
you thered be changes as soon as the
new board sat in the saddle

  regan tugged viciously at his scraggly
brown mustache

  mabbe he growled fiercely but
campbells seen old dan now or id
put one pver on the pup-i would that
there aint any birth register that i
ever heard of out here in the mountains
and if dan said he was fifty id take
his word for it

  dan wouldnt say that said carle-
ton quietly not even to hold his job

  no of course he wouldnt splut-
tered the fat little master mechanic bel-
ligerently inconsistent who said he
would and anyway it wouldnt do
any good campbell asked him his age
and dan told him and--and-oh
whats the use i know it i know im
only talking carleton

  neither of them said anything for a
minute then regan pacing up and
down the room spoke again

  its a clean sweep eh train crews
engine crews everything-there aint
any other job for him over sixty is
out everywhere a white man one of
the whitest-regan sort of said it to
himself-old dan maccaffery whos
to tell him 

  carleton drew a match with a long
crackling noise under the arm of his
chair

  me said regan and his voice
broke again he stopped before the
desk and leaning over stretched out
his arm impulsively across it id
rather have that arm cut off than tell
him carleton he said huskily i
dont know what hell say i dont know
what hell do but i know it will break
his heart and break mrs maccafferys

heart-carleton he took another turn
the length of the room and back again
but i guess it had better be me said
the little master mechanic more to him-
self than to carleton i guess it had
id hate to think of his getting it sos
it would hurt any more than it had to
and so tommy regan told old dan
maccaffery that afternoon the day
after pay day

  regan didnt mean to exactly not
then he was kind of putting it off as
it were until next day and fretting him-
self sick over it but that afternoon
old dan on his way down to the round-
house-dan took out the regular pas-
senger local that left big cloud at six-
fifty-five every evening and an hour
ahead of running time with the  was
as much a habit with dan as breathing
was-hunted regan up in the latters
office just before the six-oclock whis-
tle blew for an instant regan thought
the engineer had somehow or other al-
ready heard the news but a glance at
dans face dispelled that idea as quickly
as it had come dan was always smil-
ing but there was a smile on the wiz-
ened puckered honest old face now that
seemed to bubble out all over it

  regan said old dan bursting with
happy excitement i just had to drop
in and tell you on the way over to the
roundhouse and the missus she says
you tell mr regan dan hell be
right down glad 

  regan got up out of his chair there
seemed a sense of disaster coming some-
how that set him to breathing heavily

  sure dan-sure he said weakly
what is it

  well said dan you know that-
that trouble the boy got into back-

back-

  yes i know said regan hastily
well said dan its taken a long
time a good many years but yester-
day you know was pay day and to-
day regan we the missus and me
regan sent the last of that money east
the age limit



interest and all the last cent of it
cleaned it all up say regan i feel
like i was walking on air and youd
ought to have seen the missus sitting
up there in the cottage and smiling
through the tears oh dan f she says
and then she gets up and puts her two
hands on my shoulders and i felt
blamed near like crying myself we
can start in now dan to save up for
old age she says smiling say re-
gan aint it-aint it fine were going
to start in now and save up for old
age

  regan didnt say a word it came
with a rush choking him up in his
throat and something misty in front of
his eyes so he couldnt see-and he
turned his back searching for his hat
on the peg behind his desk he jammed
his hat on his head and jerked it low
down over his forehead

  aint you-glad said old dan a
sort-of puzzled hurt in his ey es

  ill walk over a bit of the way to the
roundhouse with you dan said re-
gan gruffly come on

  they stepped out of the shops and
across a spur old dan still puzzled
striding along beside the master me-
chanic

  whats the matter regan he
asked reproachfully i thought youd
be-

  and then regan stopped and his
hand fell in a tight grip on the others
shoulder

  i got to tell you dan he blurted
out but i dont need to tell you
what i think of it its a damned
shame the new crowd thats running
this road dont want anybody helping
em to do it after the first of the month
thats over sixty years of age youre
-youre out

  old dan didnt seem to get it for a
minute then a whiteness crept around
his lips and his eyes from regan
seemed to circuit in a queer wistful
way about the yqrds and fix finally on

ca

the roundhouse in front of him and
then he lifted his peaked cap in the way
he had of doing and scratched near his
ear where the hair was he hit regan
pretty hard with what he said

  regan he said theres two w-eeks
yet to the end of the month dont tell
her regan and dont you let the boys
tell her-theres two weeks she dont
need to worry id like to have her
have them two weeks

  regan nodded there werent any
words that would come and he couldnt
have spoken them if there had

  yes said old dan whispering to
himself id kind of like to have her
have them two weeks

  regan cleared his throat pulled at his
mustache swore under his breath and
cleared his throat again

  whatll you do dan-afterward 
old dan straightened up looked at
regan and smiled i dunno he said
shaking his head and smiling i dunno 
but itll be all right well get along
somehow his eyes shifted to the
roundhouse again i guess id better
be getting over to the  he said and
turned abruptly away

  regan watched him go watched the
overalled figure with a slight shoulder
stoop cross the turntable watched until
the other disappeared inside the round-
house doors and then he turned and
walked slowly across the tracks and up-
town toward his boarding house dont
tell her-the words kept reiterating
themselves insistently-rdont let the
boys tell her

  i guess they wont said regan
muttering fiercely to himself i guess
they wont

  nor did they the division and big
cloud kept the secret for those two
weeks-and they kept it for long after
that the little old lady  the lace cap
never knew-they ranked her high
those pioneering womenkind of hers in
that little mountain town those rough-


the popular magazine

and-ready toilers who had been her
husbands mates-she never knew

  but everybody else knew and they
watched old dan as the days went by
watched him somehow with a tight
feeling in their throats and kept aloof a
little-because they didnt know what
to say-kept aloof a little awkwardly as
it were not that there seemed much
of any difference in the old engineer
it was more a something that they
sensed old dan came down to the
roundhouse in the late afternoon an
hour before train time just as he al-
ways did puttered and oiled around
and coddled the  for an hour just
as he always did just as though he was
always going to do it took his train out
came back on the early-morning run
backed the  into the roundhouse and
trudged up main street to where it
began to straggle into the buttes to
where his cottage and the little old lady
were-just as he always did and the
little old lady with the debt paid went
about the town for those two weeks
happier looking younger looking than
big cloud had even seen her before
that was all

  but regan worrying pulling at his
mustache put it up to little billy dawes
old dans fireman one day in the round-
house near the end of the two weeks

  hows dan take it in the cab billy 
he asked

  the little fireman rolled the hunk of
greasy waste in his hands and swabbed
at his fingers with it for a moment be-
fore he answered then he sent a stream
of blackstrap juice viciously into the
pit and with a savage jerk hurled the
hunk of waste after it and swore
fiercely

  regan blinked-and waited

  just the same as ever he was said
billy dawes huskily after a silence
just the same-when he thinks youre
not looking ive seen him sometimes
when he didnt know i was looking

  regan said hm reached for his

plug as was usual with him in times
of stress bit into it deeply sputtered
something hurriedly about new piston
rings for the left-hand head and mut-
tering to himself left the roundhouse

  and that night old dan maccaffery
took out the  and the local passenger
for the run wrest and the run back east
--just as he always did and the next
night and for two nights after that
he did the same

  came then the night of the thirty-
first

  it was the fall of the year and the
dusk fell early and by a little after
six with the oil lamps lighted that at
best only filtered spasmodic yellow
streaks of gloom about the roundhouse
the engines back on the pits wrere be-
ginning to loom up through the murk
in big grotesque shadowy shapes as
regan crossing the turntable paused
for a moment hesitantly why he was
there he didnt know he hadnt meant
to be there he was just a little early
for his nightly game of pedro with
carleton over in the supers office it
wasnt much more than half past six
so he had had some time to put in-
that must be about the size of it he
hadnt meant to come there wasnt
any use in it none at all nothing he
could do better in fact if he stayed
away only he had left the boarding
house early and he was down there
now standing on the turntable and it
was old dans last run

  i guess mumbled regan ill go
back over the station carletonll be
along in a few minutes i guess i will
hm-only regan didnt he started
on again slowly over the turntable and
entered the roundhouse

  there wasnt anybody in sight
around the pit on which the 
stood nobody puttering over the links
and motion gear poking here and
there solicitously with a long-spouted
oil can as he had half more than half
expected to find old dan doing but
the age limit



he heard some one moving about in
the cab and caught the flare of a torch
regan walked down the length of the
engine and peered into the cab it was
billy dawes

 wheres dan billy aint he
about  inquired regan

  the fireman came out into the gang-
way

  yes he answered hes down there
back of the tender by the fitters
benches hes looking for some wash-
ers he said he wanted for a loose stud
nut ill get him for you

  no never mind said regan ill
find him

  it was pretty dark at the rear of
the roundhouse in the narrow space
between the engine tenders on the vari-
ous pits and the row of workbenches
that flanked the wall and for a mo-
ment as regan reached the end of the
s tender he could not see any one
and then he stopped short as he made
out old dans form down on the floor
by the end bench as though he were
groping for something underneath it

  for a minute two perhaps regan
stood there motionless watching old
dan maccaffery then he drew back
tiptoed softly away went out through
the engine doors and as he crossed
the tracks to the station platform
brushed his hand hurriedly across his
eyes

  regan didnt play much of a game
of pedro that night his heart wasnt
in it carleton had barely dealt the
first hand when regan heard the 
backing down and coupling onto the
local and he got tip from his chair
and walked to the window and stood
there watching until the local pulled
out

  carleton didnt say anything-just
dealt the cards over again and began
once more as regan resumed his seat

  an hour passed regan fidgety and
nervous played in a desultory fashion 
carleton disturbed patiently correct-

ing the master mechanics mistakes
the game was a farce

  whats the matter tommy asked
carleton gravely as regan made a mis-
deal twice in succession

  nothing said regan shortly go
on play its your bid

  carleton shook his head

  youre taking it too much to heart
tommy he said it wont do you
any good-either of you--you or dan
hell pull out of it somehow youll
see

  there was a queer look on regans
face as he stared for an instant at
carleton across the table and he opened
his lips as though to say something-
and closed them again in a hard line
instead

  carleton bid

  its yours said regan

  carleton led and then regan with
a sweep of his hand shot his cards into
the center of the table

  its no good he said gruffly get-
ting up i cant play the blamed game
to-night i-- he stopped sud-
denly and turned his head as a chair
scraped sharply in the dispatchers
room next door

  a step sounded in the hall the
supers door was flung open and
spence on the night trick put in his
head

  one glance at the dispatcher and
carleton was on his feet

  whats the matter spence he
asked quick and hard

  regan hadnt moved but regan
spoke now answering the question that
was addressed to the dispatcher and
answering it in a strangely assertive
absolute irrefutable way

  the local he said number forty-
seven dan maccaflferys dead

  both men stared at him in amaze-
ment and spence mechanically nodded
his head

  yes said spence still staring at
regan there was some sort of en

gine trouble just west of big eddy in
the beaver canon ive cleared the
line and ordered the wrecker out but
i havent got the rights of it yet only
that somehow maccaffery got his en-
gine stopped just in time to keep the
train from going over the bridge em-
bankment-and went out doing it
theres no one else hurt dawes the
fireman and conductor neale walked
back to big eddy ive got them 
the wire now come into the other
room

   regan stepped to the door and with
carleton behind him followed spence
into the dispatchers room there
carleton tight-lipped leaned against the
-table regan his face like stone took
his place at spences elbow as the dis-
patcher dropped into his chair

  there wasnt a sound in the room
for a moment save the clicking of the
sender in a quick tattoo under spences
fingers then spence picked up a pen-
cil and began scribbling the message
 a pad as the sounder spoke billy
dawes was dictating his story to the
big eddy operator

   it was just west of big eddy just
before you get to the curve at the
approach to the beaver bridge came
dawes story and we wrere hitting up
a fast clip but no more than usual
when we got a jolt in the cab that
spilled me into the tender and knocked
dan off his seat it all come so quick
there wasnttime to think but i knew
wed shed a driver on dans side and
the rod was cutting the side of the cab
like a knife through cheese i heard
dan shout something about the train
going over the embankment and mto
the river if we ever hit the beaver
curve and then he jumped for the
throttle and the air there wasnt a
chance in a million for him but it was
the only chance for every last one of
the rest of us he made it somehow
i dont know how its all a blur to
me he checked her and then the

rod caught him and- the sounder

broke almost with a human sob in it
it seemed and then went on again
we stopped just as the three hundred
and four turned turtle none of the
coaches left the rails thats all
regan spoke through dry lips

  ask him what dan was like in the
cab to-night he said hoarsely

  spence looked up and around at the
master mechanic as though he had not
heard aright

  ask him what i say repeated
regan shortly what was dan like
in the cab to-night

  spence bent over his key again
there was a pause before the answer
came

  he sas he hadnt seen dan so
cheerful for months said spence pres-
ently

  regan nodded curiously as though
it were the answer he expected-and
then he nodded at carleton and the
two went back to the supers room j
regan closed the door behind him
carleton dropped into his chair his
gray eyes hard and full of pain

  i dont understand tommy he
said heavily its almost as though
you knew it was going to happen
regan came across the floor and
stood in front of the desk

  i did he -said in a low way i
think i was almost certain of it
carleton pulled himself forward with
a jerk in his chair

  do you know what you are saying
tommy he asked sharply

  til tell you regan said in the
same low way i went over to the
roundhouse to-night before dan took
the three hundred and four out i
didnt see dan anywhere about and i
asked dawes where he was dawes
said he had gone back to the fitters
benches to look for some washers i
walked on past the tender and i found
him there down  the floor on his
knees by one of the benches but he
the age limit



wasnt looking for any washers he
was praying

  with a sharp exclamation carleton
pushed back his chair and standing
leaned over the desk toward regan

  regan swallowed a lump in his throat
-and shook his head

  he didnt see me he said brokenly
he didnt know i was there he was
praying aloud i heard what he said
its been ringing in my head all night
word for word while i was trying to
play with those-he jerked his hand
toward the scattered cards on the desk
between them i can hear him saying
it now its the queerest prayer i ever
heard and i guess he prayed the way
he lived

  yes prompted carleton softly as
regan paused

  regan turned his head away as his
eyes filled suddenly-and his voice was
choked

  what he said was this just as
though he was talking to you or me
you knofy how it is i wouldnt take
that way myself unless you fixed it up
for me because it wouldnt be right

unless you did it but i hope youll
think thats the best way out of it you
see there aint nothing left as it is
but if we fixed it that way thered be
the fraternal insurance to take care of
the missus and she wouldnt never
know and then my work is all done
and-and id like to quit while i was
still on the pay roll-id like to finish
that way and to-nights the last
chance 

  regans lips were quivering as he
stopped

  there was silence for a moment then
carleton looked up from the blotter on
his desk

  tommy he said in his big quiet
way as his hand touched regans
sleeve tell me why you didnt stop
him from going out to-night

  regan didnt answer at once he
went over to the window and stared
out at the twinkling switch lights in
the yards below-he was still staring
out of the window as he spoke

  he didnt put it up to me said
regan he put it up to god

making it a little too strong

just outside a small town in the south the colored baptists were conducting
a tremendous revival meeting great sermons were being preached religious
fervor was at its height and souls were being saved every day

    in order to keep up the good work the leading baptist minister in charge
invited the leading colored methodist minister to cooperate with him in the serv-
ices the invitation was accepted

    when the time came for the baptist to offer prayer for the evening the
methodist in order to show his enthusiasm and cooperation punctuated the
various sentences and pleas by shouting out

   amen amen

    this happened more than half a dozen times and the congregation was
stirred to an unusual degree by the repeated amen  amen v

    at last the baptist reaching the peroration of his prayer said in a loud
exultant tone

    an please grant dat each one of dese sinnahs will come forward and be
immersed

    this ended the enthusiasm of the methodist who shocked everybody by
shouting at the top of his voice

are seen patroling the peaceful streets of luxembourg germany is preparing for war with france a
telegram causes von hollman to leave the cameron chateau hastily forgetting for a moment these
ominous signs morgan accuses charlotte of being in love with the german officer but she soon convinces
him of his folly in entertaining such thoughts excitment follows apace that night a french aviator

chapter vi

the power of the machine

peeding along the boulevard
adalbert morgan and his chauf-
feur as prisoners got their first
glimpse of history in the making
-the occupation of neutral territory
by the advance guard of an army of
invasion bent upon striking at a foe
beyond

  reposing in the fancied security of
a treaty guaranteed by major powers
of europe inviolate for many years
the residents of the duchy had never
dreamed of such an astounding pro-
ceeding-not to say such an unprece-
dented one the swift entrance of the
uhlans had given no opportunity for
an alarm and even had one been possi-

ble what could this pomeranian spaniel
principality of less than one thousand
square miles have done to check the
advance of the gigantic mastiff of ger-
many bent on camping in its diminu-
tive kennel for the night

 or what resistance would have
availed on the part of a quarter of a
million peaceful devout inhabitants
against the overpowering horde of ex-
pertly trained germans every man of
whom between eighteen and forty-five
had only to take down his uniform and
weapons if commanded so to do

  although the night was now well
advanced nevertheless the atmosphere
of disturbance on the one hand and mil-
itary precision on the other were every-
where perceptible as the auto con-
taining colonel otto von hollman and

tliis story began in the issue of the popular published october rd
the conflict	

his prisoners whirled past the central
station and tram terminus afterburn-
ing into the avenue de la garde the
troops were already in command of the
place and farther along little knots
of station employees and mechanics
were descried being convoyed toward
the plateau du rham morgan shud-
dered the prison was on the plateau

  to his surprise however their own
machine kept straight on across the
main viaduct spanning the petrusse
instead of turning toward the prison it
thundered across the river the sentries
saluting the machine with a respect that
was obvious the deference-not to
say reverence-on several faces struck
morgan as rather singular under such
circumstances and he watched von
hollman narrowly the counts face
however was inscrutable

  as they entered the main part of the
city of luxembourg turning around
the cathedral notre dame passing the
ducal palace and the place darmes
where pnly a few hours before the in-
habitants had gathered to enjoy a con-
cert by the municipal band other signs
of the invasion were plainly discerni-
ble gray-clad sentries in spiked hel-
mets were at almost every corner
rapid-fire guns still canvas covered
were in position to command the streets
of the city from all directions fronting
the avenue de la arsenal and the eich
road

  they halted under the frowning
walls of the palace of justice and
bard by the entrance to the hotel de
ville whose concourse was bristling
with staff officers evidently this was
to be the brigade headquarters for the
night morgan and healy descended
at a curt command

  the military efficiency the steadi-
ness and purpose of the german occu-
pation drove the iron of despair
deeper into the souls of both men as
they ascended the steps  they felt
themselves caught in the maw of a vast

and complicated machine protest or
resistance seemed useless

  it was war war as a business as the
germans wage it and not the feverish
fantasy of a troubled dream

  the two were left in a small room
a sentry with fixed bayonet guarded
the window another stood at the door
presently a lieutenant came with two
more men they were searched and
the process was courteous but thorough
and efficient morgan whose knowl-
edge of german was limited neverthe-
less comprehended the mutter of the
officer as he left--something to the ef-
fect that he was an english spy send-
ing information to that country by way
of america

  say  demanded healy as the door
again closed upon them what does
that bird think hes saying-hey
morgan shook his head soberly im
afraid that we made a mistake in try-
ing to help that aviator

  this is like the third degree said
healy but the couht has got nothing
on us he didnt see us hand out the
gasoline he has no evidence

  he seems to think he has replied
morgan a deep melodious chorus of
deutschland deutschland iiber al-
les floated through the open window
another detachment of infantry was
marching past-then another and yet
another the last lustily singing die
wacht am rhein

  a bunch of singing societies com-
mented healy with a levity that ws
not at all in keeping with morgans
mood cheer up doc on the dead
level we have a chanst to beat this
charge whatever it is ill get woid

out to me district leader and then-

  morgan looked at him seriously the
somberness of his expression caused
healys mouth to droop and the smile
to leave his eyes but morgan was not
thinking so much of himself as of
healy had he warned healy of the
risk which they were both running


the popular magazine

when giving aid and comfort to an ac-
knowledged french spy healy might
have most wisely decided to allow
etienne martin to shift for himself-at
least he would have had a freedom of
choice in the matter instead of allow-
ing his habitual blind devotion to his
employer to place him in this decidedly
unpleasant position morgan resolved
whatever else occurred to shoulder the
blame healy could not be punished in
that event the chauffeurs education
had never included lectures on the rights
of belligerents abstruse discourses on
articles of war the difference between
noncombatants and spies nor any of
the other thousand-and-one technical
rules by which civilized nations have
agreed that their wholesale murders
shall be conducted

  the physicians reverie went back to
the beginning-to the very hour when
he had rolled up in his auto and re-
ceived mr camerons handclasp of
welcome to count otto von hollmans
subtle arrogance toward him to the
toast which the german had drunk with
the ominous words to the day

  that toast held an unpleasant sig-
nificance it was the terse expression
of the deep-seated racial ambition and
hope-a pledge to the hour when ger-
many should spring into the sunlight
the ruler of the world surely the
count for all his sneers at the imprac-
tical was a dreamer and visionary him-
self and surely too his dream was
a glorious one

  for years it had been drunk-not by
therank and file of german population
-but by the hereditary descendants
of the house of hohenzollern and the
military caste which had kept all eu-
rope in a state of apprehension since
the franco-german war

  to the day

  why had count otto von hollman
-a well-bred man-selected such a
florid toast at an innocuous lawn party
in neutral territory and within the

privileged residence of the minister of
a foreign power

  he was thinking of the peculiar ex-
pression of the counts eyes as von
hollman gazed steadily at him over
the brimming goblet of his fourth drink
of the may wine when healys voice
broke in upon his attempted analysis
of conditions-as if in answer to his
unspoken question

  say doc

  what is it healy

  the count is a nut

  what makes you think that
on the dead level doc i knew it
the minute i seen him if our machine
hadnt been a self-starter id have hit
him with the crankhandle he isnt
a dope fiend and he isnt crazy yet-but
hes on his way there did you ever
see eyes like his before

  in spite of his desperate plight mor-
gan laughed then he leaned forward

  not too loud healy we are pris-
oners remember

  healy lowered his voice to  husky
whisper as he continued

  i dont say hes crazy just because
he locked us up here healy pushed
one of the little iron chairs with which
the room was furnished in morgans
direction and took another for himself
it was his duty to do that nobody
could help seem that private strass-
man had been hurt and that young
frenchy must have had some help in
getting away but that may wine went
to his head a little too quick hes
dreamed a lot about that day he talks
about and hes a nut as sure as you
live a man gets a big idea like that in
his head and then by and by the idea
gets him the count ought to cut out
the may wine and the hochs and them
fancy uniforms and go and live on a
farm on a milk diet

  another might have treated healys
ideas as an alienist with scant considera-
tion but morgan regarded him gravely
a fixed and dominating idea has always
the conflict

 

been a dangerous thing and certainly
hollman was fixed and dominated by
the idea of germanys future as the
greatest of the world powers and the
circumstances that surrounded them
now were not such as to calm the mind
of a man with the faintest instinct for
military glory and display even the
steady pulse of morgan beat a trifle
faster at the steady maddening roll of
drums that they heard outside and the
shattering blare of bugles and if
hollman were a little affected it was
not a consoling thing to remember that
in the near future he was likely to be
the most valuable friend and companion
that charlotte could find there was
enough to worry about however in
their own immediate case without bor-
rowing trouble in regard to the future

  morgan was tired and stretching
himself glanced around the room to see
what provisions had been made for
their comfort a small iron cot was set
 each side of the room there were
several iron tables decorated with
steins and big china pipes also the
room contained the most complete and
variegated assortment of spittoons that
it had ever been morgans good for-
tune to behold outside of an iron
washstand and several small iron chairs
this was all

  morgan was still smiling a little at
this prussian military idea of a fur-
nished bedroom when the hands of the
two sentinels sprang to salute and von
hollman entered the room in the uni-
form of the death hussars he was an
even more notable sight than in civilian
clothes his eye passed over healy as
though he did not see him he nodded
to morgan but his face was grave

  i am sorry he said that this has
happened i am unusually busy to-
night but i have ordered that this room
where you are to be held for the pres-
ent be made as comfortable as possi-
ble

  oh thats all right said morgan

i dont mind this but how long
must i stay here

  you are to be tried said hollman
by court-martial for an assault on
trooper strassman and for assistance
given to a french aviator i would if
i could secure your liberty to-night
mr cameron and miss cameron have
both urged it upon me but it is a mat-
ter entirely out of my power

  i assaulted no one said morgan
strassman if he is able to talk will
appear against you in the morning it
will be for the court to decide then
and i am liable to an imprison-
ment

  imprisonment hollmans eye-
brows went up at a sharp angle per-
haps so but military necessity is some-
times sterner than that

  morgan was a man who had always
imagined himself quite above the impu-
tation of physical cowardice he had
lived a life adventurous far beyond the
ordinary and although he had known
times when he had been anxious and
even worried it was at this moment
that for the first time in his life he
tasted the sickening and terrible sensa-
tion of absolute fear he stood up-
right but felt as if he were sinking

  the dark figure of the count seemed
that of an executioner

  the light from the gas jets gleamed
on the bayonets of the two sentries
the early-morning sun might send such
a glitter from the bayonets of a firing
squad the room with its paneled
walls and hanging candelabra swayed
before him then steadied again mor-
gan heard his own voice speaking it
sounded as if it were a long way off

  you need not say any more the
far-off voice-his own-was saying i
understand but i want to go on rec-
ord now as saying that mr cameron
had no knowledge of the affair what-
ever and that my chauffeur healy had
nothing to do with any accident to any
german soldier


the popular magazine

  hollman was watching him nar-
rowly

  you are a brave man mr morgan
he said i am sorry we have not
known each other longer i will with-
draw these sentries and have your
chauffeur removed to another room i
hope that you will have a comfortable
night perhaps you will shake hands
with me

  any feeling of resentment or jeal-
ousy that might have been in morgans
breast was now overcome in the stunned
bewilderment of his present situation
he felt his hand crushed in hollmans
he saw healy disappear with a soldier
on either side of him the door
slammed shut and he heard bolts shot
on the other side he was left alone
in a garishly lit silk-paneled room fur-
nished with iron tables and chairs and
iron beds

  in luxembourg of yesterday the
luxembourg which now seemed an
old-world place this might have been
a concert room or a ballroom but now
the gilt chairs were gone and iron chairs
filled their place there were soldiers
cots where lounges had been

  french grace and luxury and prus-
sian iron how long could such a con-
test last what chance had france
against this new race of conquerors
as if in answer to his thoughts a- new
sound of fifes and snare drums arose
from the street going to one of the
tall windows he looked down at the
moonlit square at intervals of fifteen
feet or so were the gleaming bayonets
and spiked helmets of sentries across
the middle of the square passed an-
other fresh regiment of infantry the
men marching steadily and with in-
credible speed beneath their heavy ac-
couterments the shrill fifes and rat-
tling drums sounded farther and far-
ther away in the distance but still re-
mained the steady tramp of feet

  germany armed and all powerful was
sweeping through luxembourg south

and west a great machine of flesh and
blood and steel and iron armored
motor trucks guns dragged by traction
engines capable of doing the work of
sixty horses lumbering vans even trav-
eling kitchens swept past under the
moon this was the machine in which
he had been caught he had tried to
snatch one life out of its path and he
himself might pay the penalty the
gentle outward bearing of hollman
gave him no comfort he knew that
if ever a man had become the living im-
personation of the prussian system it
was hollman something of the fanatic
something of the lust of arbitrary
power was in the germans face mor-
gan felt no doubt that the count with
whom undoubtedly she was in love
would pursue charlotte as relentlessly
as he worked for germany such a
man he thought was not safe to trust
with an american girl

  he turned back into the room put
out the gas which flared and splut-
tered in the night wind threw off his
coat and shoes and flung himself on
the bed he was tired and he soon
slept no dreams broke his repose
indeed when he woke and saw the
morning light  streaming into the
strangely furnished room it was as if
he were coming back to a horrible
dream world that he had escaped from
for a few hours

chapter vii

court-martial 

  at eight oclock that morning a
breakfast of bread and coffee was set
before morgan at ten a lieutenant-
none other than young franz who
had been detained in his search of the
cameron house while martin had es-
caped-appeared at the door his or-
dinarily good-natured face was down-
cast and dejected and he shook his head
gravely as morgan rose to meet him

  this is a bad business he said i
the conflict



have been reprimanded and lost a
chance for honorable mention but you
-you are to be tried by court-martial
before major von graf

  is von graf the officer who hit my
chauffeur in the face morgan had
no very pleasant recollection of the
man

  he is i tell you you have little
chance i have a file of men outside
to take you to the trial but i give you
a minute now-for i believe that i am
speaking to a man who is soon to die
ach i like not this war to give
ones own life is well-but the other
things that a man must do

  franz dropped his glance on the floor
and turned away from morgan his
own sorrow and horror were evident
enough but there was something of
courtesy and consideration in the
averted gaze he wanted morgan to
have a moment to himself unobserved
it was all that franz could give him

  the brilliant morning sunshine
streamed in across the trampled car-
pet from somewhere near by came
the trilling of a canary a thousand
birds were singing in the wooded slopes
of the ardennes that same sunlight
was sifting through the lime trees in
the peaceful chateau of cameron it
seemed impossible that this was to be
morgans last sight of the sun that this
was his last morning in the world

  what about healy he said at
length

  he will be arraigned with you
are his chances any better than
mine

  no

  its a damned outrage said mor-
gan war had not been declared
that boy knows nothing about the laws
of neutrality suppose he did give a
little gas to a frenchman he was only
helping out a man in a hole and obeying
one of the ordinary instincts of hu-
manity you can bet something that
mr cameron has wired the secretary

of state about this and that it will cost
germany something

  franz advanced toward him and laid
a hand on his shoulder you are a
brave man he said you are hon-
est you have but a few hours to live
and i can speak freely to you if any
other man than count otto von holl-
man-any other man of the same rank
in the army of the fatherland-were
in command of the forces here i would
say that the worst that could have hap-
pened for you and the servant would
have been imprisonment in spandau for
the period of the war but hollman
he threw out his hands in a gesture of
hopelessness

  hollman is a friend of mr cam-
erons

   iriend what is friendship to him
when his wishes are opposed holl-
man is a gentleman of the highest
blood he is an officer of the greatest
attainments and skill but when his
wishes are opposed-he is a madman
there are things i coukl tell you about
him

  why should he concern himself so
much in this affair

  in england perhaps in america it
is not considered the part of a gen-
tleman to discuss ladies but you are
about to die and the time is one for
honesty von hollman is in love with
the prinzessin the niece of mr cam-
eron every one in luxembourg knows
it and every one who knows von holl-
man knows that if she does not love
him she would be better out of the
country and back in the united states
you are his rival and now it is his
duty to the fatherland to remove you
from his path

   he isnt running the court-martial
von graf is though and von graf
although he is my immediate superior
is a brute there are men such as he
in every army and it is men like von
graf who give an army a bad name

  t dont see how von hollman can


the tpovulltr magazine

dare put me out of the way he is
responsible to the government in ber-
lin they want the friendship of the
united states

  yon hollman will dare anything--
and there are secrets about the govern-
ment von hollman is a bigger man
than his rank or name would indicate
i dont know what-but there is a mys-
tery about him

  t am confident said morgan that
if we could hold off this court-martial
till this afternoon it would never come
off

  franz shook his head you are
wrong he said

 hasnt mr cameron cabled to
washington and wired to berlin
franz nodded

  those cables will be answered
again franz shook his head there
will be no answer to the cables or the
telegrams mr cameron wrote them
and gave them to the telegraph official
that is all how do you know that
they have ever been sent 

  lie laid his hand on morgans arm
just as the little ormolu clock on the
mantel struck the quarter hour

  come he said i have given you
more time than i had intended

  outside the door was a squad of four
infantrymen in grayish-green caps and
service uniforms and with fixed bayo-
nets with the consciousness that two
of these bayonets were very close to his
back morgan was marched down a
flagged corridor down a flight of stairs
and into a great assembly room there
were chairs for many people in the
room but it was deserted save for sen-
tries at the doors and a sinister-looking
group of officers in brilliant uniforms
seated about a table on a raised plat-
form

  healy was there very pale and quiet
between two soldiers and morgan could
see seated in the background a big
giant of a man in the uniform of the
uhlans with a bandage about his head

he had expected to see mr cameron
there but there were none but german
soldiers morgan moved to the place
he was directed and looked down upon
the heavy face and pale dull eyes of
von graf in a sort of daze this speed
and expedition the absence of is  r
cameron meant only one thing-that
what lieutenant franz had said was
true and that he and healy were being
railroaded to their death to please a
madman who happened to be in love
with charlotte

  he and healy were left standing
while the proceedings went forward
they moved with a businesslike brisk-
ness that left both the americans too
bewildered to protest one officer was
busy taking down a stenographic record
of the examination while the others
made occasional notes von graf left
his position as presiding officer to tes-
tify himself he spoke in german
he pointed out healy and morgan and
it was evident that he was identifying
them there was no doubt about the
official correctness of the proceedings
in spite of the dispatch with which they
were conducted

  morgan and healy were represented
by counsel a slim young officer of hus-
sars with light hair and a sharp nose
while a staff officer with a red beard
was the prosecuting official when von
graf had finished his testimony he was
submitted to a little cross-examination
and after contemptuously answering a
few questions took his seat with the
five other officers who composed the
court

  franz followed him standing very
straight and giving his testimony with
soldierlike directness and simplicity
two privates of the eleventh uhlans
dressed in their uniforms with yellow
facings followed him they testified
in regard to the pursuit of the aviator
then private strassman was called

  he was an immense rawboned man
with sleepy good-natured eyes after
the conflict



answering the usual questions as to his
name and rank he was called upon to
face the prisoners he turned his
bandaged head in their direction and
healy and morgan looked into his eyes
this was the man whose word was to
send them to their doom with a sink-
ing heart morgan looked at him and
then-something happened that seemed
so bizarre so unreal as to make mor-
gan feel again that he was living
through some grotesque and horrible
dream

  private strassman the man who had
been riding after the aviator with lance
upraised who had been left lying sense-
less on the turf after morgans inter-
vention winked at morgan

  the rest of strassmans face re-
mained impassive and stolid but the
left eyelid dropped and raised itself
again it was not an accident there
was no mistaking it it was a genuine
american wink quite friendly and with
a sort of alertness about it quite out
of keeping with strassmans general
appearance his head was turned di-
rectly toward morgan when it happened
and away from the commanding offi-
cers so that morgan and healy alone
could see it

  von graf addressed him in german

  can you identify the prisoners as
the men who interfered with you last
night he said

  nein said strassman calmly ich
kann nicht

  strassman made the announcement as
one stating the most trite and common-
place fact but if he had thrown a
hand grenade at the group of officers
at the table he could not have created
more of a disturbance von graf rose
to his feet with an explosive exclama-
tion they all leaned forward red-
bearded counsel slim sharp-nosed
counsel and judges all seemed to
spring toward strassman who stood
stiff and straight as stolid as if his
face and head were really wooden as

von graf was shouting forth in ger-
man the presiding officer waved the
counsel away and examined and cross-
examined strassman both in german
and english strassman was absolutely
unshaken he had never seen either
healy or morgan before yes he un-
derstood the nature of an oath and
was telling the truth yes he remem-
bered the men who ha-d attacked him
they were not at all like the prisoners
what were they like they were men
with whiskers who looked like rus-
sians

  as the examination proceeded it be-
came evident that von graf alone of
those present was disappointed and
enraged the other members of the
court-martial were doing their duty but
it was evidently a decidedly unpleasant
duty and they were distinctly relieved
they showed it in several ways one
leaned back and began to hum the pil-
grims chorus from tannhauser in a
booming voice the red-bearded prose-
cutor produced a cigar from some place
in his uniform and lit it strassman
stuck stoutly to his story and at the
end of half an hour von graf sank
back in his chair tired and angry

  were he in my regiment he said
i would know what to do with him

  healy was called next but it was evi-
dent by this time that von graf was
to be disappointed although he was
the presiding officer it was the five
judges who voted as to the guilt or in-
nocence of the prisoners and it was
clear that they were all relieved to find
that they were guilty of nothing very
serious healy had evidently been
called next as the less intelligent of the
two but he made a good impression

  he admitted having sold petrol to a
french aviator but he denied that he
had intentionally done anything wrong

  if i had known there was a war
coming  id have kept out of it he
said earnestly ive got nothing
against goimany my mother was


the popular magazine

goiman and my father irish and i al-
ways liked nudel soup better than irish
stew were not spies and we didnt
hurt nobody were americans and
mr morgans the whitest man you ever
saw-his business is to mend broken
heads not to break them-hes a doc-
tor

  we may need him said the red-
bearded prosecutor who had a better
command of english than the others
he turned and addressed the group of
officers who constituted the court

  it is evident that the wrong men
have been detained he said mr
morgan is an american doctor of good
character and the other man is his
chauffeur it is plain that they are
not the men who attacked private
strassman as prosecuting officer i
recommend that the prisoners be dis-
missed on their parole without further
examination

  von graf rose to his feet his voice
shaking with anger as he spoke

  major schmidt he said you are
a traitor

  major von graf said schmidt
stroking his red beard there will be
an opportunity for you to apologize for
that when my friend calls on you in
the meantime what says the court
count von hollman ordered this in-
vestigation said von graf he thinks
this man guilty is your authority
greater than his

  i am neither a tool of von holl-
mans nor afraid of him said schmidt
i do what i think my duty

  he turned to the five judges a
vote f  he said

  nicht schuldig boomed out the
man who had been singing tannhauser
nicht schuldig came from each in
turn

  you shall pay for this schmidt
said von graf in a low tone

  when you please said schmidt
he bore one scar on his forehead and
he was evidently looking forward to a

duel with von graf as carelessly as if
it were a breakfast party

  still in a sort of daze healy and
morgan found themselves taking an
oath not to fight against germany nor
to aid succor nor assist in any way the
foes of the fatherland

  still half stunned and bewildered
morgan found himself a free man out
in the sunlight once more with healy
beside him and major schmidts arm
passed through his in friendly fashion

  he felt weak and staggered the
peril through which he had passed the
unexpected nature of his rescue the
whole bewildering succession of events
actually seemed to weaken him phys-
ically and it was all he could do for a
moment to keep his feet and answer
the friendly question of schmidt who
had lived in new york at one time and
wanted to hear from the old town once
more

chapter viii

charlotte pulls tiie strings

  an hour later morgan and healy
back once moreat the cameron house
learned the meaning of strassmans
wink and his failure to identify them
charlotte was responsible for his
strange behavior vhen he was brought
to the house unconscious from his fall
the gallant lieutenant franz had been
charmed to allow the prinzessin whom
von hollman admired so much to
dress the wound of his uhlan over his
gallant protestations strassman had
been carried to charlottes room char-
lotte had as her uncle sometimes re-
marked quite a way with her and von
hollman was not the only man in lux-
embourg who admired her

  when private strassman of the
eleventh uhlans came to after his
tumble he thought for a moment that
he had died and was already in heaven
he was in a dainty white room on
charlottes own bed and the sight of
the conflict



a large bible on a table at his elbow
lent strength to his religious illusion
for strassman in his simple way asso-
ciated bibles with heaven and thought
that they were the only books allowed
there in still further proof of the
belief that he was in heaven there was
an undeniable lady angel bending over
him watching him solicitously with the
most beautiful blue eyes it was quite
ten minutes before he realized that he
was in the same old world and that this
beautiful room the like of which he
had never imagined was one of the
apartments of the chateau at the end
of that ten minutes he had formed a de-
cidedly favorable opinion of charlotte

  his head was far too sound and hard
to be fractured by a tumble on the turf
and it was only the shock of his metal
helmet being driven against some sen-
sitive nerve that had knocked him out
for the time being his greatest wish
the thing that would have made this
paradise quite paradise enow for
him was a long cool drink of beer but
charlotte gave him tea instead and told
him it was better for him she talked
to him in german expressing her sym-
pathy and then found out that he could
talk english and that he had once
worked as a waiter in a cafe in cincin-
nati charlotte knew something about
cincinnati herself and by the time that
strassman realized that he was still on
earth they were quite good friends
while mr cameron was making the
wires hot sending out dispatches to
washington and berlin charlotte like
betty was pulling the strings

  of course she sympathized with
strassman and strassman himself as
soon as he began to realize what had
happened to him bore no rancor

  i saw the young man reach for der
bridle he said unt then the horse
reared unt i fell

  pm quite sure he didnt mean to
hurt you said charlotte and now
theyve gone and arrested him

  so  said strassman sympathetically
it iss too bad indeed unt the air-
man did he get away 

  he got up in the air all right said
charlotte but im almost certain
theyve shot him or caught him or what-
ever they wanted to do she added con-
solingly but mr morgan is arrested
-and what will happen to him

  he will be tried by court-martial
said strassman cheerfully

  oh dear said charlotte and
what will happen then

  i will appear against him went on
strassman methodically i will be
called as a witness unt i will be con-
fronted with der brisoner unt asked to
identify him

  terrible said charlotte clasping
her hands and what will happen
then 

  i will be confronted with der bris-
oner went on strassman quite enjoy-
ing the interest he was arousing in the
breast of this charming young woman
i will then identify him unt hewill
be found guilty of inderfering with a
german soldier in pursuit of his duty
in time of war

  and then

  he will be led out by der firing
squad unt shot it is der law of war
shot said charlotte he mustnt
be shot he cant be shot hes the
nicest man i know and the kindest
why mr strassman im especially
fond of him and im sure he wouldnt
have hurt you for the world if he had
known you were performing your duty
perhaps he didnt think you ought to
ride your horse across the grass you
must be a wonderful horseman to have
ridden over that hedge its really too
bad that you fell off just when you were
doing so nicely

  it was nothing said strassman
patronizingly a tumble now and then
is nothing

  and you are not going to let mr
morgan get shot for a little thing like


the popular magazine

that hes one of the best doctors in
america and i am sure he could fix
up your head much better than i have

  it is the rule of war the law of
war

  strassman was an unemotional man
but when he saw two bright tears actu-
ally forming in charlottes eyes his
own honest heart was wrung

  ach fraulein he said i am
sorry

  and you are going to do it you
are going to murder him

  ach no it is not murder it is
martial law but what can i do 

  supposing said charlotte wiping
away her tears with a small handker-
chief and looking very businesslike-
supposing you were to say you didnt
know him supposing you said you
had never seen him in all your life
they would have to let him off
wouldnt they	 

  yes said strassman doubtfully

  you have a wife and family said
charlotte

  i have a mother in hanover

  is she wealthy

  wealthy ach no she is very
poor

  i know that mr morgan if he were
free would be very anxious to do some-
thing for you-just to recompense you
for your injury you know he didnt
mean to hurt you it was just his
clumsiness and hed like very much
to give you saythree hundred dollars
-that is if he were free

  so said strassman cautiously but
with interest he felt as if he were
being drawn into some kind of a trap
but somehow he liked the trap and it
was very hard to deny charlotte any-
thing when she was bent on having her
own way like most unselfish people
she was generally busy trying to get fa-
vors for other people

  surely you are not the kind of a
man to wish to see mr morgan shot
she went on

  ach no i am not that kind of a
man

  then you wont do it will you

  strassman found it quite impossible
to look into those beautiful and pleading
eyes he felt that he might readily be
made to cry himself over the fate of
morgan he looked down at the coun-
terpane

  but what can i do he said

  do what is right said charlotte
get up and say that you never saw
him in all your life and stick to it
they cant hurt you for that can they 

  no

  youll not only be saving his life
but youll just be telling the plain hon-
est truth went on charlotte with an
innocent and eager sophistry it was
too dark to see him there you couldnt
possiblv have seen who he was-now
could fou 

  maybe not said strassman doubt-
fully

  then youll tell the truth youll
say you dont know doctor morgan and
never saw him and youll save his
life and youll get the three hundred
dollars to send to your mother in han-
over  and youll be a hero  and i-
ill never never forget your kindness
charlotte clasped her hands ecstatically
and gazed into strassmans eyes
strassman wiggled uneasily and one
large foot appeared from under the
counterpane he withdrew it in great
emba rrassment

  ach fraulein he begged let me
think it over for a moment it is an
important matter-my duty as a sol-
dier

  charlotte rose yes she said
soothingly i mustnt bother you now
with your poor head aching so i dont
know whether you remember it or not
-perhaps you were just a little deliri-
ous from your terrible fall-but you
said something about beer when you
regained consciousness in fact it al-
the conflict



most sounded as if you actually wanted
to drink beer

  yes said strassman honestly i
was not out of my head

  suppose i send you up some beer
two or three bottles 

  three said strassman

  four said charlotte enthusiasti-
cally or five-nice and ice cold al-
though its bad for you but you are
such a strong man

  yes said strassman modestly i
am a strong man

  well if i send it up will you drink
it

  yes strassman was quite positive
about this

  and think over what ive said
  yes gnadige fraulein

  charlotte departed and the beer
after a short interval arrived

  strassman had hoped that it would be
light beer and it was he had hoped
that it would be cold and it was he
had hoped that there would be five bot-
tles and there were-also a big stein to
pour it into after the servant had de-
parted he sat on the edge of the bed
in his shirt and uhlans trousers and
drank the first bottle the day had
been a long and hot one he had rid-
den far and hard in his heavy accouter-
ment the dust of the road was still
in his throat the tea he had drunk
had not washed it out it had only
sprinkled it so strassman thought he
drank the first bottle rather hurriedly
as a preparation to considering the
problem before him the second bot-
tle passed into the beyond a little less
rapidly and by the time he was drain-
ing the third he was thinking at the
same time he was beginning to feel de-
liciously comfortable too comfortable
to think anything unpleasant and dis-
agreeable it was delightful to have
his heavy boots off and these soft slip-
pers on and it was a nice room he
was whistling gayly at the end of the
fourth bottle and halfway through the
iqa

fifth he had quite made up his mind
von graf might rage but he was a
german soldier and would do his duty
and the fraulein was a lovely lady and
his mother certainly needed the three
hundred dollars morgan was saved

  charlotte gasped with horror as she
saw the tray brought down so soon
with the five empty bottles-but still it
was a good omen and strassman as he
had explained was so strong a man
that beer didnt do him any harm

  upstairs strassman having discov-
ered his large china pipe on a table
ready to his hand had filled it with
leichter canaster and was puffing
beatifically

  how much of it was beer how much
tobacco how much native imagination
and literary genius is not to be dis-
covered but the moment when the first
cloud of smoke left strassmans lips
was the moment when the two fat rus-
sians with whiskers took form out of
the void and became dangerous enemies
of the fatherland

chapter ix

the spiders web

  strassman got his three hundred dol-
lars by the time it reached him he
was firmly convinced that it was noth-
ing in the nature of a bribe but simply
reparation for the injuries he had en-
dured also under the influence of
sundry other bottles of beer and a chat
with charlotte he firmly believed that
it was really those creatures of his
fancy two whiskered and villainous
russians who had upset him from his
steed to his companions smoking
their pipes in the luxembourg barracks
he narrated the thrilling tale of his en-
counter with the russians and with
each repetition it grew and strassman
believed it the more why doctor mor-
gan after taking the trouble to stitch
up his head most skillfully should send
his mother three hundred dollars as a


the popular magazine

recompense for injuries inflicted by two
russians was a question that did not
at all trouble him strassman was a
german but not of the scholarly sort
and logical sequences never kept him
awake at night

  the red-bearded major schmidt
who had been morgans prosecutor in
the military trial in which strassman
had so distinguished himself was a
guest at the chateau for dinner the fol-
lowing evening he arrived early but
still earlier in the day count von holl-
man himself had driven up in a motor
to inquire as to the comfort of the
camerons and ostensibly also to offer
his congratulations to fairfax morgan
on his escape

  remembering all that lieutenant
franz had told him in that hour when
he believed himself about to die remem-
bering also his own feelings and fore-
bodings in regard to the count it was
still hard for morgan to believe that
von hollman was anything other than
the polished and civilized gentleman he
appeared

  it is a pleasure indeed to see you
free again mr morgan he said i
was sorry that i could not be present
at the court-martial i did all i could
for you in the selection of the officers to
form the court

 remembering von graf and what
franz had said of him morgan was not
able to make his gratitude particularly
apparent or enthusiastic but von holl-
man seemed entirely at ease and un-
ruffled

  the german army is a machine
he went on its military value indeed
its very existence requires that it move
and act like a machine and it must
sometimes grind up ruthlessly the hu-
man particles that fall into it although
i am at the present moment in com-
mand of the movement to occupy lux-
embourg i am just as much a part of
the machine as strassman for instance
it is not for me as your english poet

puts it to reason why i am just a
private in the ranks long ago when
the plans for the occupation of luxem-
bourg in case of an emergency were
made by the board of strategy every
possible contingency was foreseen and
the definite instructions for the com-
manding officer in charge were drafted
it is my duty to obey these orders to the
last detail i have done my share now
the military occupation of luxem-
bourg is now complete carried out
according to the provisions of the
schedule now it is for us to wait until
some further movement of the greater
machine the german army is com-
municated to this part here and sets it
in motion again

  this occupation of luxembourg is
undoubtedly a great military feat said
mr cameron acidly may i inquire
what the next triumph will be

  von hollman smiled tolerantly and
laid his hand on camerons arm my
friend he said you know as well as
i do that if i knew the answer to that
i could not tell you but surely your
ears are good enough to have heard
some unusual sound in the air

  i should say they were said cam-
eron t left new york to get rid of
the confounded steam riveters-i have
a nervous system although charlotte
and fairfax dont seem to know
what it means i thought that lux-
embourg wtas a quiet place if such
could be found in this world to-day  but
last night and this morning were worse
than new york ever thought of being
that confounded vibration never lets
up for a minute

  the sound which continually filled
the air was not unlike the muffled and
distant vibration of a thousand distant
hard-rock drills it was low-more of
a steady jarring and shaking of the
air than a sound-harsh and distinctly
unpleasant

  some ingenious german ought to
the conflict



put a muffler on your war machine
said morgan

  yes said charlotte if you can
invent a noiseless army mr cameron
will think more of you than of the man
who invented wireless telegraphy

  whatever effect the irreverent com-
ments of the three americans may have
had on von hollman none was evident
but good-humored amusement

  he laughed softly and lit a ciga-
rette

  you americans he said chil-
dren among the nations and wonderful
gifted children to whom everything is
possible to whom nothing is serious
and all of life-peace and war and love
-is a great joke if i were to fall in
love with an american girl he tilted
back his head and looked at charlotte
through lowered lids i would be more
afraid of her sense of humor than of
anything else to be ridiculous is the
most fatal thing to a lovers chances
and it seems to me that it is the gift of
the american girl to make all men feel
ridiculous

  its a good thing too said char-
lotte if you people-you men-all
knew how ridiculous all this military
business really was youd be ashamed
to wear a uniform you might as well
make a serious business of tennis or
croquet

  von hollman sat up straight and his
eyes snapped he was like a man who
sparring lightly suddenly receives a
blow that really hurts but at the same
time is resolved to conceal his hurt to
keep control of himself and of his
temple

  prinzessin he said my work is
over for the present perhaps you
would find it still more amusing to ride
out with me in my motor car and see
some of the parts of this ridiculous war
machine of ours-and how well they
work

  charlotte bit her lips and hesitated

i dont care for war machines she
said

  perhaps the prinzessin is afraid
suggested von hollman a little
afraid as well as amused

  charlotte jumped to her feet im
ready she said

  it is too bad hollman turned to
mr cameron as he rose it is too bad
that i have a seat for but one other be-
side myself and the driver in the car
but i am most anxious to have one
american girl see that we germans al-
though a race of soldiers are not a race
of barbarians-that although a stern
struggle for actual existence forces us
to hold a way through luxembourg for
our troops to march we do it peace-
fully and kindly and with as little in-
convenience to the people here as pos-
sible

  the harsh monotonous vibration of
the air grew louder and harsher the
distant muffled riveting hammers and
compressed-air drills were pounding to
a faster tempo

  the guns of the army before liege
said von hollman they are clearing
the way so that our right flank may be
guarded when that sound ceases their
work will be done and we will be able
to move southward

  von hollman and charlotte passed
out into the hall the count had left
hanging there a long gray military cape
and his hussars busby it was an al-
most oppressively warm afternoon and
he left them hanging there putting on a
cavalry fatigue cap which his chauffeur
handed to him while charlotte took
nothing but a linen duster and an auto-
mobile veil

  it was not without some misgivings
that cameron and morgan standing
side by side on the porch watched them
roll off down the driveway and disap-
pear under the lime trees of the boule-
vard charlottes veil fluttering gayly
in the hot breeze in fact as they both
told themselves if it had been any other

girl in the world but charlotte they
wouldnt have let her go she had al-
ways been accustomed to having her
own way-not as a spoiled child who is
indulged-but as a practical womanly
sort of little girl with a thought for oth-
ers and a sense of responsibility one
whose way was generally a wise one

  i wish we were all out of here said
morgan at length

  mr cameron pulled a black cigar
from his pocket and lit it

  t cant leave here he said

  but i could take charlotte back to
new york with me as the count said
yesterday there wont be any tennis
tournaments in france this year

  we are in the midst of a general
european war said cameron lux-
embourg will likely be a safe place
all the fighting will be farther south-
in france but when i think of char-
lotte-i dont like von hollman

  nor i said morgan let char-
lotte go with me i have passports so
has she

  but the railroads said cameron
the german government owns all the
roads in luxembourg and theyll take
all those in belgium-and for a long
time yet they wont be used for any-
thing but the transportation of the
kaisers troops

  ive got one of the best motor cars
in europe to-day and shes in the best
of condition new tires-and extra
ones-and provisions and gas for an
extended tour said morgan you
know that its a hobby with me and
whatever in the world you may say
about healy hes a good mechanic and
one of the safest fastest drivers i know
and you know that i can drive a bit my-
self i know the roads between here
and paris i was planning to go that
way myself

  i wonder how long paris will be
safe said mr cameron and i won-
der why i dont get any answers to my
cables to washington and the wires to

brussels and berlin i spent a lot of
money on tolls yesterday but not a
word have i heard-not a word

  there you are morgan pointed
theres the answer now

  an elderly man in a tight blue uni-
form decorated with numerous brass
buttons was riding a bicycle up the
drive he dismounted at the foot of
the steps carefully adjusted the wheel
so it would stand upright and came up
to them holding two packages he was
not the telegraph messenger who had
brought the dispatch to count von holl-
man the day before that man had
been a native luxembourgian who
spoke french this messenger was a
german

  herr cameron he said

  ja said mr cameron

  he presented-the two packages das
geld he said as he extended one
dcr brief telegraphische he said as
he thrust the other package into mr
camerons hands mr cameron studied
the packages they bore numerous
official seals and were addressed to
herr robert cameron in businesslike-
looking german script

  the messenger now presented a book
and a pencil and indicated that he
wished mr camerons signature hav-
ing secured this he replaced book and
pencil in his cap clicked his heels to-
gether saluted stiffly mounted his ma-
chine in a painstaking methodical way
and rode slowly off down the drive he
was a quaint figure this sedentary mid-
dle-aged german in his tight-fitting uni-
form there was stiff seriousness and
sense of responsibility in every thrust
of his short legs as he pedaled off

  another cog in the war machine
said morgan but the diplomatic repre-
sentative to luxembourg did not answer
him mr camerons face was rapidly
growing red and redder his eyes were
flashing angrily the black cigar was
cocked upward at a ferocious angle
the conflict



  look at this he said in a choking
voice slapping the contents of one pack-
age with a sheaf of american money
which he had taken from the other
look at this final outrage

  mr cameron held in his left hand a
bunch of telegraph and cable dispatches
all in his own handwriting and some of
considerable length they were ad-
dressed to the secretary of state at
washington the united states embassy
at brussels and the united states em-
bassy at berlin they were all pro-
tests more or less indignant against the
arrest of morgan and healy

  in the other hand together with a
sizable wad of crisp american money
was a message in english to the effect
that owing to military necessities the
german governor of luxembourg had
taken charge of the telegraph and cable
offices and that press of business had
made it impossible to transmit the mes-
sages of mr cameron the money he
had paid for tolls was respectfully re-
turned to him

  this means said cameron in a
voice shaking with indignation that if
charlotte hadnt thought to get on the
right side of that trooper you would
hve been shot fairfax this isnt the
work of the german government
they have too much sense it is von
hollmans orders and he is crazy if
i dont get reparation for this my name
isnt cameron and there isnt any de-
partment of state in washington i
dont want their rotten money he
shook the sheaf of bills under morgans
nose but im going to get my mes-
sages through or kill somebody mili-
tary necessity a cog in a machine
an infernal smooth-spoken cutthroat
lunatic thats what von hollman
is

  it was at this moment that the red-
bearded major schmidt who had been
invited to dinner strolled up the drive-
way his arm in a sling

chapter x

to break the web

  angry or not disturbed or not mr
cameron was at all times a gentleman
and when he gazed into the smiling
brown eyes of major schmidt who was
a gentleman himself a good deal of the
disturbance left him from the church
of st nicolas of luxembourg clear
and sweet above the jarring faint dis-
cord of far-off german cannon came
the chimes which play every two hours
in the ancient city the refrain of its
national anthem the words of which
are we want to remain just as we
are

  there was something soothing about
the mellow cadence there was some-
thing genial and mellow about the red-
bearded schmidt who spoke as good
american english as is to be heard in
st louis or cincinnati

  you are hurt said morgan indi-
cating his bandaged wrist and i am
afraid i got you into that fight

  i had an old account to settle with
von graf schmidt shook hands with
his left hand this scratch will be
better in a day-and von graf has a
bandage round his head he will not
call me traitor again but my old friend
herr cameron whom i have not seen
since i was a young lieutenant and was
appointed to take care of him at the
military maneuvers-he seems dis-
turbed

  i am disturbed said cameron
look here major schmidt we are
old friends and you have some sense
ive known you since you were working
in the experimental department of the
westinghouse concern in america
what do you think of this 

  major schmidt whistled softly as he
looked at the telegrams in mr came-
rons handwriting and the official
stamps across them he shot a keen
glance at young morgan and stroked
his red beard reflectively


the popular magazine

  this is terrible he said at length
when count otto von hollman holds
the reins he drives hard and von
graf the brute is von hollmans man
-and von hollman is attracted by your
niece mr cameron

  i suppose so said mr cameron
rather sulkily he didnt like to have
people talk about charlotte and every
time her name was coupled with von
hollmans now had a perceptible ef-
fect on his temper

  you think it not likely said
schmidt that your niece the prinzes-
sin charlotte would think of marrying
von hollman you must pardon me
he went on raising his unwounded
hand in a deprecating gesture i may
seem brutally frank and inquisitive
thats all right said morgan
charlotte doesnt want to marry von
hollman or any one with a title said
mr cameron shes out riding with
him now in his motor car and i wish
she were back

  we are old friends mr cameron
said schmidt and i remember your
niece when she was the most wonderful
little girl with blue eyes and golden
hair and i was a sentimental young
german with red hair and nota friend
in america but you-and the beautiful
little charlotte

  i remember your poetry cameron
forgot the unsent telegrams and
chuckled and the way you used to
keep us awake at night playing the
flute

  ach yes said schmidt lighting a
cigar  the days of our youth were
the days of our glory but the prinz-
essin it is no longer safe that she re-
main in luxembourg

  what does it all mean said cam-
eron jumping to his feet and pulling at
his white mustache who is count
von hollman anyway  is there no ap-
peal over his head what kind of a
government have you anyway he
strode up and down the floor

  a very good government said
schmidt but an aristocratic govern-
ment-and there is some rumor that
count von hollmans birth is higher
than his name or rank would indicate
at any rate although he is a man of
the highest ability he behaves some-
times as if he were a prince of the
blood rather than the colonel of a hus-
sar regiment

  and you-are you as much afraid
of him as the rest are you attached
to his command 

  ach no schmidt took a long
pull at his cigar and stroked his red
beard i am not attached to his com-
mand i am in the zeppelin service-i
know something of the gas and the ma-
chinery and the compressed air-thanks
to the good westinghouse company
where i worked once for living wage
-and to the good americans my or-
ders-mobilization orders-were to be
here at luxembourg august th to re-
port to the head of my division i ar-
rive here ahead of time and learn that
your friend mr morgan is to be tried
by court-martial it is a serious busi
ness they are short of officers for
the court and i volunteer to prosecute
i may help that way and von graf
who presides does not know me as the
friend of mr cameron but von holl-
man pouf major schmidt snapped
his fingers the kaiser cannot afford
to punish a man who knows the secret
of the zeppelin gas that will not burn-
to please the whim of von hollman i
am a soldier but also a scientist and
they respect the scientist in germany
well what are you driving at
then the eternal drone of the dis-
tant steam drills had grown a little
louder and the incessant jarring vibra-
tion that seemed to communicate itself
to the whole house was telling on mr
camerons nerves what is von holl-
man going to do do you think he
plans to abduct my niece by force
major schmidt knocked the ashes
the conflict



from his cigar and his red-brown eyes
were very serious if the rumors i
have heard are correct he said von
hollman comes of a most remarkable
race-but a race whose men have
scrupled at nothing in the past in car-
rying out their personal wishes and de-
sires and where women have been
concerned this has been especially so
he turned to morgan suddenly you
have a motor car he said

  sixty-horse power said morgan

  and passports and identification
cards 

  i can give him all he needs said
cameron

  then said schmidt earnestly i
would advise you to take miss cameron
out of luxembourg at once

  i can get into longwy in france by
midnight said morgan

 longwy major schmidt shook
his head you little realize what
changes will take place in a week
longwy will be a german garrison in
three weeks there will be uhlans scout-
ing between the forts of paris ger-
many is up hr arms she is irresistible
in the might of her armies his eye
kindled and his voice grew louder and
fuller there is but one obstacle ger-
many cannot pass as yet and that is the
sea have you a road map 

  morgan brought a road map and
going out on the lawn they spread it
on the very table at which they had sat
drinking may wine the afternoon be-
fore the same sunlight filtered
through the lindens and checkered the
velvet grass with shifting patterns of
green and gold they breathed the
same rose-scented air and the boule-
vard adalbert was as still and deserted
as ever for troops had ceased to pass
that way the only difference was the
insistent nervous jar of the siege guris
wrecking liege borne to them a hun-
dred miles on the northern breeze and
yet the afternoon of yesterday and all
its talk and happenings seemed as far

off as if it had been a thousand years
ago

  morgan spread his road map on the
table using a cigar box as a paper
weight against the restless winds and
schmidt traced out roads on it with
a stubby forefinger

  i have traveled these roads but lit-
tle he said but i know them well
and the whole countryside having
looked down on it often from the car
of a zeppelin it is an easy run to
arlon

  yes said morgan but whats the
matter with running north to spa and
then east to brussels 

  major schmidt laughed down in his
throat my young friend he said
you do not realize how fast the ger-
man army marches spa is in the hands
of a prussian corps and wherever you
meet the prussian you may know that
von hollman can throw a loop about
you by telegraph

  how can he stop him if he has pass-
ports  said cameron

  a thousand ways do you suppose
the hand that had the noose at his
throat only this morning the hand that
sent you back your messages unsent
will fail to strike again-and strike
harder this time  it was to remove the
chances of mr morgans taking char-
lotte from luxembourg that von graf
the butcher and the brute was made
judge advocate of the court-martial
there are other von grafs in the ger-
man army other cogs and wheels in
the machine

  why not go to ostend suggested
morgan

 there may not be time to a
stranger to any one at liberty to com-
municate with the outside world i could
not talk of the plans of the german
army-but once liege falls there will
be a southward movement the real
invasion of france is here in the east
our western screen of troops will take
liege and namur-perhaps they will


the popular magazine

hold louvain and brussels-but ant-
werp shall be safe-for a time-unless i
should happen to visit it in the air above
some night we will not delay to take
antwerp-there is not time just-
enough of belgium to protect our right
flank and lines of communication and
then on-on into france to paris

  he seemed a little ashamed of his
burst of enthusiasm for he fell silent
suddenly and began measuring distances
on the map with a folding metric rule
which he drew from the pocket of his
coat

  you wonder at me for talking so
you americans he continued in a
lower tone but germany is fighting for
life-for more than life-for a place in
the sun to have colonies and thrive and
grow like other great peoples the
slav with his millions to the north and
east the slav and the french in the
south and west the english fleets upon
the sea  germanys to be smothered 
all the patient industry of her peoples
all her science music art and letters
will avail her nothing unless we strike
-and strike now to respect treaties
is well but a drowning man may clutch
at the property of another to save him-
self and we mean no harm in belgium
-nor yet in luxembourg all we want
is a passage for our armies-our sol-
diers who carry the future germany
with them in their onward march

  he looked up suddenly and the old
humorous expression came back to his
red-brown eyes

  mr cameron used to laugh at me
when i was a young man he said
and he is laughing at me now mr
morgan your nearest seaport is ant-
werp and you must strike for ant-
werp and drive fast and had if liege
holds out long enough you are safe-
but south of namur and north of
france where the eastern army will en-
ter must be your course drive west
as far as alost anyway-well west of
brussels before you strike north for

antwerp and from antwerp you have
the sea the diamond pathway of the
sun and moon to-take you safe back to
america

  just the same wild talker as ever
julius said cameron going back to
the name he had used when schmidt
was a boy but i will say that your
heart is in the right place and that you
have some sense charlotte shall go
with fairfax and his confounded
chauffeur will have to act as chaperon
schmidt i dont suppose you ever drink
cocktails any more 

  never said schmidt except when
i see you mr cameron

  you see me now said cameron
striking the bell

  just sipping his cocktail schmidt
turned to morgan who was still por-
ing over the road map

  i noticed colonel von hollmans
busby and cape in the hall he said

  yes said morgan not looking up
he left them there what about it
hide them said schmidt

  what for cameron and morgan
both asked the question

  theres only one busby like that in
luxembourg said schmidt and von
hollman is the only man with a right to
wear it he has honorable rank in the
death hussars among other distinc-
tions if miss charlotte wore that and
the cape and it were dark a too-offi-
cious sentry might not ask questions
for he would think it von hollman
himself in the auto

  as dangerous as that-and with
passports said cameron

  major schmidt nodded

  wont von hollman ask for his
things said morgan

  tell him his orderly was here to
report to him and carried them back
to headquarters said schmidt and
hurry theres an auto coming up the
drive now and miss cameron and colo-
nel von hollman are in it

  as the count and charlotte ascended
the conflict



the front steps healy was rapidly re-
moving himself from the house in the
direction of the garage in the rear un-
der his arm were a gray cape and the
black headdress of a colonel of the hus-
sars of death

  as charlotte stepped into the recep-
tion hall it was evident at once that
something unusual had happened her
eyes were very bright her cheeks very
pink-almost red in fact and her hair
a most unusual thing with charlotte
was in slight disarray

  count von hollman she was saying
in a high scarcely natural voice i must
thank you for a most remarkable after-
noon it was quite a lesson-almost a
surprise-i might say

  von hollman bowed

  i am glad to be of service to the
prinzessin he said he bowed also to
the others then something cold re-
pressed-almost stern in all three faces
-made him straighten up suddenly
he acknowledged major schmidts sa-
lute with a sharp movement of the
hand then turned toward the hat rack
my cloak he said

  your orderly called said mr cam-
eron and said that he would take it
back with him

 ah said von hollman good
evening gentlemen prinzessin auf
wiedersehen

  there were three masculine good
nights but no word from charlotte
she stood silent pushing her wavy hair
back into place watching the dark fig-
ure mount to the motor car and the car
itself turn and vanish down the drive
she turned to face major schmidt
holding out both hands which he
clasped eagerly

  the same old julius she said id
know you anywhere

  and the same fairy princess said
the sentimental julius beaming over his
red beard

  charlotte released herself from him
and turned to her uncle

  julius is a friend she said and so
is fairfax so i can speak plainly im
going to get out of germany just as
soon as i can it isnt big enough to
hold me and that man she pointed out
the door in the direction von hollman
had taken at the same time

  what did he do said cameron

  dont ask me what he did-or what
he said said charlotte her eyes were
blazing and her cheeks were crimson
and dont you ask me fairfax or
you julius schmidt i never spent
such an hour i wont think about it
or talk about it but i think hes crazy
and he seems to run this whole place-
and im going to get out of here and
back to boston-and the whole ger-
man army cant stop me  charlottes
voice which had been steadily going up
broke into an hysterical little sound
half laugh and half sob

  my dear prinzessen said major
schmidt

  healy  shouted morgan roll out
the gas wagon well soon be on our
way

chapter xi

the open road-and the bright
face of danger

  in the scented dusk the motor car
purring softly swung about the portals
of the chateau des herthereux and
started west on the wide road for the
moment the distant cannonade the far-
off growl of the war lord had stilled
its jarring rumble once again the
beautiful chimes of the church of st
nicolas were ringing out the music of
feirwon that luxembourg patois an-
them of lentz the refrain of which
says we want to remain just as we
are

  the white road was not as smooth
and fair to see as it had been twenty-
four hours before one coil of the
great war serpent the green-and-gray
serpent with steel scales the modern
the cpovulatr magazine

monster of steel and machinery of men
and horses had been dragged along it
and even in the dusk the tracks were
plain to see the car slithered in and
out of new deep-worn ruts morgan
in the rear seat of the car leaning out
and looking down could see the tracks
of the monster-the impression left by
huge flat sectional tires-rectangular
blotches stamped in the white road
metal like the terrifying footprints of
some prehistoric beast

  but no dinosaurus could vomit invis-
ible annihiliation for miles as this or-
ganism could over a mountaintop or a
city-to- blot out hundreds at a breath
or blast into nothing the cunning war-
rens of concrete and steel contrived
against its onslaught

  now the rear seat of the machine was
piled with a different baggage from that
which it had carried the day before in-
stead of golf clubs and tennis rackets
morgan had a pair of lugar automatic
pistols there was an automobile camp
kit a traveling trunk for charlotte and
in his pockets morgan carried a sheaf
of passports and letters of identifica
tion and introduction from mr cam-
eron to various officers he knew in the
french and german armies besides
this he had money-not letters of
credit-but cash both french and ger-
man

  charlotte sat in the front seat
wrapped in the gray military cape and
wearing the black busby with the white
skull and crossbones of the hussars of
death surely she was as strange a
soldier as had ever worn this sinister
insignia one of the princesses of the
royal house of prussia is nominally a
colonel in this famous regiment and
has been often photographed in the
headdress and jacket of an officer
charlotte was nothing at all like her in
figure which the military cape covered
but in face there was just the faintest
resemblance to the hohenzollern prin-

cess in the photographs wearing the
deaths head busby

  by advice of major schmidt the
lights of the motor car were not lit it
was a black car with no brasswork and
as they felt their way along the road in
the first hours of darkness before the
moon arose the car seemed like a
deeper shadow in a place where all was
shadow

  morgan had not overstated the facts
when he said that healy was driving
one of the best motor cars in europe
its engine was a special one which mor-
gan had secured from a friend in
prance it had the four speeds for-
ward it was practically silent and it
was driven by a man who knew it and
loved it like a brother healy soon
found out where the ruts and worn
spots were in the road and avoided
them

  they moved along at a moderate pace
steadily climbing the slow slope north-
ward and eastward luxembourg
with its ancient towers its quiet in-
dustrious peace-loving population lay
behind them caught tight in the grip
of that inexorable military machine
from which they were now trying to
escape the chimes of st nicolas
might ring out at every second hour
their ancient refrain we want to re-
main just as we are but luxembourg
was no longer to remain as it was she
was caught in a coil of the serpent
bugles were blowing in her peaceful
market place her quiet streets were
the bivouac of armed hosts

  there were times when both char-
lotte and fairfax morgan might have
thought war a glorious thing and there
were times when healy now pale-faced
and silent gripping tensely the wheel of
the car had derided the apostles of
peace but in this hour as their car
climbed the long hill westward as they
listened to the distant reverberation and
waited for the moon to arise they were
all oppressed not by the sense of per-
the conflict



sonal danger for all in their respective
ways were brave and unselfish enough
but by the horror the folly the pathos
of war the thousands dead the peace-
fully happy fields plowed up by charg-
ing squadrons the innocent children left
fatherless the weeping and desolate
women the ravaged beauty the ruined
honor-all this and more of tragedy
spoke in that sullen rumble to the iiorth

  it was almost moonrise and they
were far beyond luxembourg city when
healy whose steady gaze had never
for a second been removed from the
road ahead brought his machine to a
standstill and pointed across the road
was a dark shadow two feet from the
ground-a rope to stop the passage of
a car such a trap as a country con-
stable might set eager for the fines of
city speeders

  as they came to a standstill a figure
emerged from the shadow at the side
he was a noncommissioned officer and
wore the spiked helmet of a prussian
line regiment he did not see the black
car but paced back and forth his hands
clasped behihd him-for he carried no
rifle-across the road he was sing-
ing

kennst du das land wo die citroncn bliihn
im dunkeln laub die gold-orangen

     gliihn-

  he stopped his song suddenly as
healy threw more gas into the motor
and started it humming he saw them
and came toward them now was the
test of the value of the death hussars
headdress it was too dark to distin-
guish man from woman to see a face
but perhaps he might recognize the
white insignia on the black background
and perhaps it might not be necessary
to show those passports which they all
felt would be of little value anywhere
in count von hollmans jurisdiction

  the prussian came nearer and healy
suddenly threw on the lights illuminat-
ing his face and figure he was a well-
set-up fellow with a blond beard he
was blinded for a moment by the bright
lights then his eye was caught by the
dark erect figure of charlotte in the
shadow behind them it was instan-
taneously evident that he took her at
once for count otto von hollman his
heels came together his figure straight-
ened up his hand came to his forehead
in the old familiar way he wheeled
about and gave an order other hel-
meted figures appeared the rope was
dropped and healy threw in the clutch
they shot across it picking up speed as
they went

  they had passed the last vidette of
hollmans troops the moon was ris-
ing behind them and the road stretched
clear before each of the three felt
that they had passed the first great dan-
ger healy slumped down in his seat
as he held the wheel charlotte heaved
a tremulous sigh and leaned back to-
ward morgan and morgan himself
relaxed his tense grip on his lugar pis-
tol and caught one of her hands in-
stead

  they were climbing the slopes of the
leafy ardennes sometimes a rabbit ran
across their path sometimes a fox
barked in the black forest the cool
chill of evening came with the rising
moon had it not been for that steady
nimble to the northward it might have
been a country road in peaceful
america

  if they could have pierced the dark-
ness before them but the forests
muffled the stealthy march of thou-
sands and no sound of drum or trum-
pet on that night no rocket nor scout-
ing aeroplane marked the german ad-
vance

doves of peace and war eagles

incredible as it may strike the casual observer there have been almost as
many wars as years in the past half century more than thirty nations have
been at war since the shocking conflict of  between france and germany
some of the countries having opened hostilities twice in that comparatively
brief period here are a dozen of the most important combatants on the list
austria brazil china france germany great britain japan russia spain
italy turkey and the united states altogether quite a quorum of world
powers

    in  to the shot-and-shell accompaniment of our philippine insurrection
and the boer and british conflict in africa the first peace conference met at
the hague to assure the world of international felicity twenty-six nations were
represented and the dawning twentieth century was heralded as the long-looked-
for era of brotherly love and universal comity mars must have smiled satirically
at this powwow of peace for hardly had the cooings of the hague dove ceased
when the boxer uprising plunged the foremost nations into a melee of wholesale
slaughter all through the boxer troubles the boer war went on and continued
long after the fracas in china germany too jumped into the african arena with
a slogan of no quarter to her dusky neighbors terror and rage had no sooner
subsided in south africa when the russians and japanese were at each others
throats and such carnage followed as had never been recorded in modern his-
tory two instances abundantly prove this on the plains of mukden 
combatants clashed and fought for fourteen days and the list of casualties was
the largest of any single encounter knowtn totaling  killed womided and
missing the investment and reduction of port arthur involved four and a half
months of desperate fighting the casualties being estimated at  in round
figures

    came a lull in  undaunted and idealistic the hague held its second
peace conference at which forty-four nations were represented with eyes
seemingly blind to the bloodshed of the first seven years of their chosen century
of arbitration the pacificators declared that war was extinct an article before
us in a newspaper of the time puts their conviction succinctly in a paragraph

    the movement for the abolition of war among civilized nations is no longer a utojjfan
dream of statesmen and philosophers but has bccome a popular agitation which literally
caught in the net

 

encircles the globe arbitration disarmament and a permanent international congress are
being urged by public meetings in america most of the countries of europe and even
distant japan the movement is not confined to one class college professors economists
labor leaders editors and socialists join in the demand that war shall cease that interna-
tional law shall take the place of violence and bloodshed

    there is little need to refresh our minds that the balkans greece turkey
and italy soon enough dispelled this millennium dream and that the present gigan-
tic struggle of  is a skull-and-crossbones label to their sweet prescription for
peace on earth

    truly the dove of peace has been brooding upon eagles eggs

   and for the so-called humanization of war which has been on every lip
we fear there is no such anomaly under heaven war has always meant and
can only mean cruelty ruin and death if the soldiers of queen victoria were
guilty of barbaric acts during the indian mutiny the french and germans were
equally heartless in boxer uprising and african butchery and similar acts must
be considered as the concomitant of war anywhere

   let us borrow for a moment a german classic entitled on war to fur-
ther convince ourselves a man named clausewitz wrote the work which is
rated by military critics as highly as faust is by literary savants the author
born in  learned from napoleon and von moltke oyama and other great
army heads have used his book as their lexicon we append a few of clause-
witzs tenets which are being followed by the fighting leaders at war to-day the
italics are our own 

    to conquer and destroy the enemys armed forces is the leading principles of war

    the compulsory submission of the enemy to our will is the ultimate object

    violence-that is to say physical force-is the means

    violence arms itself with the inventions of science in order to contend against violence

    war is an act of violence which in its application knows no bounds

    let us not hear of generals who conquer without bloodshed

    self-imposed restrictions almost imperceptible and hardly worth mentioning termed
usages of international law accompany violence without essentially impairing its effect

    philanthropists may imagine that there is some clever method of overcoming and dis-
arming an adversary without causing great bloodshed and that such is the proper tendency
of the art of war however plausible this may appear it is an error which must be
extirpated for in such dangerous things as war the errors which spring from benevolence
are just the worst

    we must employ all the resources which we can make available with the utmost energy

    he who uses force unsparingly without reference to the quantity of bloodshed is sure to
obtain the advantage if his adversary does not do likewise

   the greatest war of all times is now waging on these principles we can
only pray that at the third peace conference scheduled for  the dove
may at last prevail against the eagles-that at least the work of clausewitz and
what it stands for may be relegated to the relics of barbaric days

index numbers

                                                                                                             

now and then one sees reference in the daily papers to an index number
in connection with securities or wages or commodities or something else
but what an index number is and what it is good for are mysteries to
most persons

    briefly an index number is a means of showing the fluctuations in the aver-
age price of a group of related things the basis on which the average is com-
puted is usually the range of prices during the ten years between  and 


 the popular magazine

in that decade economists assert conditions were almost ideally normal the
average wages in a group of trades the average of business failures the average
prices of a certain number of commodities or whatever is to be the subject of
the index number is ascertained and the result is designated as  subse-
quent averages are compared with this normal average and the percentage of
difference is added to or subtracted from the  which is the base the result
is the index number

    for example take the cost of living this year and last compared with the
normal period between  and  it began in  with  as the index
number--which was  higher than the normal average of the wholesale
prices of a group of  commodities selected and arranged to represent a theo-
retical familys food budget it climbed to  in april plunged to  in
june then rocked up and down between  and  ending with the latter
figure indecember this years cost-of-living index number was  in may 
in july  lower at the opening of august and is now shooting upward again
on the average it will be several per cent higher than last year and probably will
be  or more above normal by december

    the rise and fall of the index number is oftenest shown by a chart if the
fluctuations are severe the lines look like a profile of the jagged peaks of the
ancles if they are moderate they curve up and down like rolling country

    the index number is the economists horoscope it is more of a guide show-
ing the general tendency than a prophet predicting what the end will be

as safe as a battlefield

do you want a job at from fifteen to twenty-five dollars a day no experience
necessary apply to a powder plant those are the wages they pay
in the glazing room as the price of courage no man need be out of
work if he cares to take the risk there is always a vacancy the whole
staff changes  an average of once every six months occasionally the
inevitable happens oftener the men just quit because they cant stand the con-
stant strain

    the glazing room is the danger center of the powder mill there is nothing
more hazardous than that steam and friction there polish the granules of
powder a suggestively perilous combination the glaze on the powder puts the
finishing touch to its highly explosive powers the better the glaze the stronger
the powder-and the greater the danger

    no one ever goes into a powder plant from curiosity unless he is childishly
inquisitive visitors are not welcome but the few that do appear after hav-
ing obtained their passports from those high in authority are thoroughly searched
before they enter every piece of metal-suspender buckles garter clasps
money everything-mustbe left outside once inside every moveis watched
by the attendant at the first gesture indicating fear or carelessness the visitor
is hurried away there is no ceremony about it either

    a visitor in a powder plant to conceal his nervousness drew a toothpick
from his pocket instantly two of the men nearest him threw him to the
floor and took it from him they thought it a match and were taking no
chances

    the men who make high explosives may get used to their occupations
but they live in constant dread they say that every powder plant blows up
caught in thb net



some day they are very superstitious a woman in the plant is the worst
of bad luck therefore no woman ever is permitted to enter if one got a
look in the men would quit in a body and never come back

philip

a depositor in one of the greatest banks of america went to the presi-
dents office one day and told to him a little story he delighted in telling

good said the president now will you write out what you
       have said to me

     the depositor did

    here is what he wrote

     whenever i enter or leave the bank i am sure to receive a courteous greet
ing and smile from philip philip is the gentleman of color who officiates upon
the main floor answers questions and directs strangers to their proper anchorage

    he wears in addition to his smile a smart uniform of blue with white
gloves and west point itself even upon a field day does not boast of a more
soldierlike personage

    any bank can take and safeguard your money and even pay it out to you
again on demand any bank can upon the presentation of proper collateral make
you a loan and there are many other conveniences and courtesies which can be
extended but there is only one bank to my knowledge that possesses a philip

    philip has that rare quality of not knowing or appearing to know what
manner of man or woman you are to philip every person entering or leaving
this-i came near saying his-bank is a potentate and deserving of all the courtesy
and attention supposedly due a potentate

    it makes no difference to him whether my clothes are ready-made and old
or the latest creation of a master whether i am about to deposit millions or seek
a small loan-i am a visitor and a customer and am therefore entitled to instant
recognition and courtesy or if i require it attention and help

     in a bank capital and surplus are necessary officers with brains and business
acumen are necessary conveniences and assistance are a part of the service you
expect clerks and tellers must naturally be in attendance but besides and beyond
all these there is something more to be desired and philip supplies it cold winds
may blow or summers sun beat down rains may descend and floods come but
the cheerful smile and inherent good nature of philip are undisturbed like the
brook they go on forever

    most of us are very human and we may at times be scant with our cour-
tesy yet kindliness on the part of others we never fail to observe and appreciate

    the little things of life are important a particle of grit may not wreck
the machinery of a great establishment but it disturbs smoothness and makes
the cylinders knock a lubricant is a fine thing to have handy when the gears
grind philip helps supply the grease he makes things run easier he saves
horse power he helps us to the best of his ability to conserve our energy

    what the world needs is more kindness what the individual needs is more
patience and what banks need is a philip for he is more than a faithful watch-
man more than an efficient servant-he is an institution

    the president had that tribute printed on parchment tens of thousands
of copies have been struck off and philip-a gentleman whose skin is black-
will be known america over because he is a gentleman

   what happened at the hour of the morning shot at s b canon in
british columbia where the grand trunk pacific was breaking a hardrock
grade toward prince rupert a story of giant powder and unparalleled
bravery

kenny sighed and said women
were hard the remark broke
a sort of gloomy silence and
his friend whom men called
bonfire because of a flaming poll of
short red hair threw back his head and
laughed at the early sun

  oh i dont know said he and
laughed again

  kenny turned his head he was a
dark-faced young man with straggly
black hair eyes packed away under
black brows a long black upper lip and
a great clean-shaven jaw that looked
sullen as death

  what are you laughing at he de-
manded

  nothing said bonfire why

  i just wanted to know said kenny

  they sat on the bunk-house steps
looking out over the dusty little con-
struction town there it sprawled in
the white morning sun a slattern sham-
ble of frame shacks and wooden build-
ings flung up the hill you might say
to follow the road

  about reared the black cake of the
mountain ledge upon ledge tier upon
tier silent nebulous in the clear un-
tempered light

  breakfast was just over and a noisy
crowd held the bunk-house porch they
stood in sixes and sevens tall bar-
baric-looking men deep of chest with

shoulders like broad ledges of rock
careless of speech and gay at heart

  lets go kenny said suddenly

  where asked bonfire looking sly
for he was a big red animal and the
sun was warm

  kenny stood up

  lets go down to the grade said
he

  whats the hurry protested bon-
fire its early yet wait till the night
shift pulls the morning shot theres
something i want to ask you about any-
way

  come on then said kenny and
started off

  bonfire looked after him for a mo-
ment

  oh sugar he said mildly and got
up and followed

  on the way down their speech con-
tinued simple and infrequent kenny
produced a small sack of tobacco and
a little red book and they began roll-
ing cigarettes

  i should let em alone he said
lighting his

  what asked bonfire puffing

  kenny took a deep inhale

  women said he

  there was a moment of silence which
bonfire broke

  well said he i wish youd begin
with sandy mccann
fire in the hejding



  huh said kenny

  and the two men stopped in full
stride sandy mccann was the grand-
daughter of old robin mccann who
tended the commissary at s b canon
for the railroad contractors

  you heard me bonfire said evenly
i want you to let her alone

  kenny scratched his head

  thats what worries me said he
i cant

  bonfire stuck out his lip

  you better he said belligerently

  why ive got ten pounds on you
easy argued kenny

  bonfire grinned and showed his
strong white teeth

  youll need it said he

  thus they faced one another adding
irony to menace two big young men
chock-full of speed and heat they
stood almost in front of the commis-
sary which overlooked the lower bend
of the road

  there she goes kenny said in a
minute he was looking by over bon-
fires shoulder down the road

  it ended at the grade-a long level
white concourse of crushed stone that
wheeled in a slow sweet curve toward
a quarrylike cut in the flank of the
mountain where as kenny spoke a
stupendous pillar of earth and rock of
a sudden rose in the air

  boom

  the great hills shook and in a near-
by shack a pane of glass fell with a
tinkling crash which accentuated rather
than disturbed the momentary silence

  boom-m

  two said kenny

  there was no wind only this low
sullen road and the sound of a dog
howling somewhere

 then-

  three counted bonfire

  the fourth fell to kenny

  people could now be seen on the
low porches and stoops along the road
men coming out singly and in small
na

groups with a few women and fewer
children all to stand and look at the
mountain there was no excitement
it was merely the hour of the morning
shot at s b canon in british colum-
bia where the grand trunk pacific was
breaking a hard-rock grade toward
prince rupert

  shot succeeded shot tearing the
earth a measured crash on crash as
of a battery of big guns meanwhile
the two big rock men continued their
friendly account kenny had the ninth
and marked the deeper note of the shot

  black powder he said and the
red-headed man nodded

  its good stuff in the middle holes
  burns too slow

  prime it with giant

  thats better but i like fine white
muck black powder gives you noth-
ing but great chunks a good clean
shot of giant well set down is the boy
to smash the rock

  well said bonfire this one fin-
ishes it

  boom-m-m

  the earth reeled slightly and out on
the grade there reared a chaotic chim-
ney of rock and dust towering against
the mountain for a moment then cas-
cading with a pattering roar a great
aura of dust and smoke rising slowly
as on unseen wings through the golden
silence that comes straight from the
heart of the early sun

  for a moment the two men stood
quiet looking out on the grade far
below thin lines of black specks were
picking their way back through the wild
street of broken rock toward the un-
finished railroad cut they were the
men of the night shift returning to the
scene of the shot to see what they
should see

  bonfire moved restlessly

  well said he that gives us just
about a half an hour

  it wont take that long said
kenny


the popular magazine

  what dyou mean  demanded the
red-headed man

  nothing said kenny without
turning his head

  bonfire regarded him sullenly

  well  said he

  kenny turned lifting his lids

  in a hurry now arent you

  no but the whistle blows at seven

  well said kenny looking around
i guess this place is as good as any

  bonfire nodded and without further
ceremony the two men began to pull off 
their corduroy jackets in a minute
they stood facing each other stripped to
the waist they looked beautifully
young and strong and the light which
had now the peculiar almost supernat-
ural softness and limpidity of light fall-
ing in the early morn of the mountains
came full upon them and caressed their
stark lithe nakedness

 kenny looked solemn want to
shake hands  he asked

  bonfire grinned might as weli
said he advancing just to show
theres no hard feelings

  this they did then both men sprang
apart

  ready muttered kenny his head
down

  come on said bonfire and the two
men rushed together

 smack smack kennv had bon-
fire in the mouth and the red-headed
man didnt like it he tasted his own
salt blood and saw red for an in-
stant their figures whirled in a blur
then they stood free giving smash for
smash

  a shout arose up the road the pro-
cession of the day shift had begun and
the leaders hurried down knots of
men followed on the run and an old
man came out on the steps of the com-
missary

  he stood on the low stoop for a mo-
ment grinning at the sun a little lean
man with wthite wild locks sticking out
around his crown like an aureole that

had been drawn through a bramble-
bush which will do for robin mc-
cann commissary clerk for grant
brothers the railroad contractors

  the crowd gathered quickly making
a ring they stood seven and eight
deep picking their men

  go in kenny

  now bonfire

  for the fighters clipped about spar-
ring they moved after one another
with short springy steps chins up sa-
lient like the carnivora

  come on kenny yelled a sup-
porter

  kenny turned his face no hurry
he said and ducked swiftly

  for the red-headed man had swung
on the instant kenny side-stepped and
caught him in full dash driving left
and right to the body he followed up
avith a rush of his own

  the crowd veiled for him and robin
mccann avent back into the commis-
sary he went behind the counter
and opened his ledger turning to the
ks

  blackie kenny so ran the head-
ing of the page and the storekeeper
totaled the account then he turned
back coming to the cs

  cobleigh said mccann ross
cobleigh here it is a long reckless
list for a short-stake man

  he made two slips one for each bel-
ligerent might as well have them both
ready though only one would be
needed that of the defeated man who
if he was able would stop only long
enough in camp to call for his time
give away his bed and go this is a
custom among rock men a good cus-
tom too that lends immediate and hon-
orable extinction to the fiercest quarrel
whether it be for a job or a woman or
because a man just naturally cant get
along somebody must go that is all

  mccann was checking over the two
slips when his granddaughter sandy
came out from the rear of the store
fm in the heaving



where she kept house she was about
twenty slim and supple as larch with
a bright color and the round neck and
plump throat of a dove she had
abundant yellow hair long lashes some-
what darker and a habit when she
spoke of dropping her lids and smil-
ing

  grandfather said she and looked
at life with the mild blue stare of a
merry young nun

  the old man lifted his head

  eh he said

  whos fighting 

  two young fools

  a yell bombshelled out in front and
sandy ran to the window and looked
i knew it she said in a minute

  if the old man heard he gave no
sign

  how does it go he asked pres-
ently

  in a hurly-burly of heads and shoul-
ders you cant see very much for the
crowd ah said she i saw kennys
face then

  how does he look

  strong-yet like it hurt him to
breathe

  the man lacks his second wind is
bonfire any better off

the men are yelling for him
hes the lighter man thats why
the advantage is always with the
smaller but dont you worry about
kenny he added after a bit

  the girl tossed her head

  im not worrying she said hes
nothing to me

  he sat on the stoop last night
yes but bonfire was there before
him

  i know and kenny stayed last the
man is like that lass he is for a fact
the girl turned her face from the
window when she spoke she dropped
her eyes and lowered her voice as peo-
ple do when religion or a dead parent
is the matter

  i call him hard said she as hard

and stubborn i say as some of his
own wild rock

  the old man leaned forward eagerly
youve said it lass-a man draws
character from his work strange
wild stubborn stuff the rock you can
cut it with steel and break it with
giant but you cant kill it ever its
smashed yet it lives they say ready
to strike back youve said it lass
there are men like that kenny for
one

  he paused-for the crowd shouted
again and the girl watching at the win-
dow gave a little cry mccann glanced
across

  how is it now

  kenny is rushing like an angry
bull

  hes got his second wind then
how they yell

  bonfire has all he can do to save
his head ah she cried hes down

  i told you up black down red
chuckled the old man the girl was
white as windflowers but she went on
calmly enough

  theyre both down she announced
with a certain satisfaction

  eh cried mccann

  kenny fell over his man carrying
into the crowd i cant see either of
them now wait theyre both up again

  good said mccann

  bonfire is smiling continued the
girl and something-the excitement or
what-slowly kissed a stronger color
into her cheeks

  aye muttered the old man bon-
fire would smile he would for a fact
so would a wolf to show his teeth

  its a rare flashing smile the girl
said quickly the old man sighed it
was an old mans sigh and he shook his
head at his skinny knees

  there was a moment of quiet which
was smashed out o doors the men
began shouting some ones name it be-
came a deep bellowing roar

  bonfire was the shout


the popular magazine

  for up to now the red-headed man
had given way ana been clubbed down
by sheer weight kennys long game
was to give and take bonfires to hit
and get away and now with kenny
slowing up for breath he fell in and
out of his old snapshot form kenny
had had his inning for a while there
had been no avoiding this big-bodied
avalanche of bone and muscle and the
red-headed man had had all he could
do to cover up and run this he did
saving his head until the rushes began
to fall short grow more unsteady more
wild which must be expected if you
dont get your man and then taking
his time bonfire began to cut kenny
to pieces thus the tide turned and
the crowd seeing it cheered

  kenny still rushed but bonfire
moved like a wind-driven shadow hit-
ting hard and fast at every turn at this
moment kenny paused and then as if
gathering his last bit of reserve strength
he made a staggering charge slugging
out with both fists bonfire side-
stepped neatly parading some pretty
footwork he ducked under a full right
swing and driving left and right to the
ribs got away kenny reeled under the
savage impact but turned and came
back gamely he rocked a little as he
came opposite his man and his arms
drooped as if he felt his fists to be an
unutterable weight his face showed
terrible punishment every breath he
drew seemed a great actuality the
man was all in

  finish him bellowed the crowd

  bonfire smiled his eyes were calm
even pensive but his face was terrible
-livid with the strange unearthly rus-
set pallor that follows the stormy pag-
eant of red-headed men like a curse of
god a sudden hush fell on the crowd
which had drawn back a little so that
the two men in the middle might have
plenty of room to make an end

  this much sandy saw from her win-
dow the rest she saw from the stoop

  bonfire sprang in kenny raised his
right arm with the motion of a tired
child and bonfire playing to the crowd
threw up both arms in a sort of mock
horror to save his jaw he got a
laugh all right but hard rock is hard
rock and gallery hazards their own
crime and punishment for whatever
happened to kenny he shifted to the
right on the instant and sinking his
left as he staggered by drove the blow
home under bonfires upraised guard

  it was a terrific bunt kennys fist
traveled only four inches but his shoul-
der made nine bringing the whole body
behind the fist which landed flush over
the heart-a two-hundred-and-ten-
pound jolt the blow would have
dropped an ordinary man bonfire it
doubled into a tortured knot and as
he straightened up kenny advanced a
bit unsteady but still competent to fin-
ish him

  something happened then which must
be expected

  kenny

  the voice halted the big rock man in
full stride the crowd parted and sandy
burst into the ring between the two
men

  kenny she cried

  he lifted his head saw her and
dropped his arm he faced her stream-
ing with sweat panting as if the labor-
ing breath would rip open his chest
there was blood on his forehead and
a keen half-cruel look about the tight
lips and impatient eyes

  huh  said he on a great gasping
breath that was like a sob

  do you want to kill him she de-
manded

  kenny put up one hand and brushed
some of the blood and sweat from his
forehead

  i would said he and bonfire pull-
ing himself together reeled out from
behind the girl

  come on he muttered i aint
done yet
fwe in the heading



  sandy shouldered him off big as he
was and fronted kenny -i cant stand
any more of this she said in a low
voice

 kenny drew another tremendous
breath and nodded toward bonfire

  dyou want him then he asked

  he looked her full in the eyes and
sandy hesitated the crowd was quiet
but drawing close-a circle of dark
hairy faces real yet unreal for her in
that moment as the malign masks of a
dream

  bonfire a little aside cleared his
throat in the silence

  well said he

  but the girl looked only at kenny
there was no minx in her now and if
her eyes held his it was all very frank
and unconscious

  i was just wondering she said
slowly

  kenny gazed down at her his dark
face of a sudden lighting up writh a
quizzical tender grin

  no hurry he said but bonfire had
it otherwise framed

  let her settle it now he said
harshly what dyou say sandy he
demanded plucking her arm and swing-
ing her about so that she once more
stood between the two men

  for reply the girl tore herself free
she turned regarding the red-headed
man for a moment then she threw
back her head and shook forth a soft
bubbling laugh that filled the place with
music-and pure scorn

  no she cried and so left them

  tht crowd opened awkwardly with
a shy truculence the men didnt quite
understand it all yet sandy mounted
the stoop at the door she wheeled sud-
denly her head thrown back the white
throat showing her face upturned like
that of a woman who is kissed upon
the lips

  i hate you she said quite dis-
tinctly

  kenny looked up

  who said he

  you said sandy and the door
slammed behind her

  bonfire laughed a pleasant soundless
laugh through closed lips

  now will you be good he said to
kenny who grinned sheepishly

  i guess i put my foot in it all right
said he

  i was a little hasty myself ad-
mitted bonfire and they laughed to-
gether-silent friendly laughter

  the men joined in breaking up
around them there was nothing else
to do for the whistle would blow in
a minute and somebody was fetching
up a pail of water

  take it said bonfire

  go on said kenny and the red-
headed man grabbed the bucket then
when both had drunk their fill they be-
gan to wash up without further argu-
ment in the same pail

  mccann still sat behind the counter
when sandy flew back into the store
i told you not to go he chided her
sandy had nothing to say till she got
her breath

  when does the minister come up
the river again she asked

 the minister said mccann
why lass 

  i want to tell you something
said she

  mccann considered

  lets see doctor darlison the
presbyterian comes up every third sun-
day this is the second week and
saturday he should be here to-mor-
row then on the morning work train
why now asked the old man

  i shall be wed then said sandy

  the old man sat up

  ha said he who is the man

  thats the trouble said sandy i
cant make up my mind

  and then suddenly with the chaotic
passion and abandon peculiar to women
and children the girl put her yellow
the pocpular magazine

head down on the counter and began
to cry

  hush child said the old man lis-
ten there goes the whistle 

  by the time kenny and bonfire had
pulled on their jackets and found their
hats the lower grade was black with
the hurrying procession of the day
shift even now the advance guard en-
tered the jagged portals of the great
cut which was to open a way through
the flank of the mountain they
started down the hill following the
men the earth sloped before them in
the sunshine east and south the sky
was a vast opal northa long spur
of purple mountains stretched their
rosy flanks and two big pink clouds
came sailing out solemn and stupendous
over the world

  tell me something bonfire began
as they reached the grade have you
never been whipped blackie

  kenny shook his head

  never said he but i was close
to it this morning

  oh i dont know said bonfire
you threw it away said kenny
they were nearing the cut the por-
tal loomed full of shadow and away
from the mountain on the left for-
ever separated from the mother rock
there rose a huge white spire lifting a
profile of sheer beautiful lines the
cut was almost finished the way lay
open save for a big bench of white lime-
stone about twenty feet high and more
than thirty feet deep which still blocked
the far end of the cut

 kenny marked this as they ap-
proached

  leaves a pretty good jag of rock
said he

  we ought to break it with the day
shot said bonfire

  kenny considered him figure on
using any black powder

  id like a little said bonfire-in
the middle holes

  the other cast a robust sigh well

said he to-morrows sunday and they
were figuring on getting the portals of
that new work around the bend opened
up by the first of the week

  what dyou mean demanded bon-
fire  for black powder in its place was
his hobby

  kenny grinned nothing said he

  oh have it your own way said
bonfire they were the powder men

  they found the cut in a thunder of
activity men swarmed everywhere
even on the walls high in the air cling-
ing to ropes like flies with picks and
shovels others attacked a young hill of
broken rock heaped before the bench
this was the product of the morning
blast and these men were the muckers
they ranked with the barrow men who
worked between the bench and the
dump the drills were mounted on the
bench and now as kenny and bon-
fire walked through the cut all sounds
the sullen roar of the broken rock down
the dump the shouts and yells of the
men on the walls the clear skirl of pick
and shovel were blotted out in the high
note that was the terrific duet of rock
and steel

  there were four drills tripods
driven by compressed air piped up from
the power house below town they
stood on the flat shelf of the bench
each machine manned by a drill run-
ner and a helper the latter knelt be-
fore the drill bar the runner standing
aft turning a little crank the helper
swung a wrench pointing the drill and
seeing to it that the steel ran free in the
hole the runner stood back feeling
things through the crank while the ma-
chine drove the steel down through the
living rock

  over all stood the foreman of the
cut-a squat barnacle-faced man with
a hard mouth and a chest like a churn
fie grinned down at kenny and bon-
fire as they ascended the little path that
led up the side of the bench
fire in the heaving



  when are you going to finish it 
he yelled above the din

 kenny bent over him i dont
know he shouted this evening i
guess-the inflection falling to bon-
fire who nodded back

  to-night-after shift was what
they read on his moving lips

  thus they agreed but very much
happened yet that day but all things
in order thus they fell out

  seven holes of the round were set
dowfi by ten oclock these were the
side holes and by the time the men
knocked off for dinner kenny and bon-
fire had six of them ready for the pow-
der for bonfire with hard luck and
dry sand had lost the seventh

  she was skittish to go with said
kenny

  bonfire had showed some chagrin
men counted him a master of his craft
and a lost hole was a lost hole

  i tried her when they first took the
steel out added kenny and broke a
good tamping rod

  she slid away from me sulked the
red-headed man just like she had
eyes

  i always use wet sand in them
kind suggested kenny

  i like it dry said bonfire-tamped
down with a little fine gravel

  as he pleased kenny took another
tack i dont think you sprung her
too strong said he

  wrong again growled bonfire
that was just it-i used her too hard
and she let me hold the bag i made
the first pocket with three sticks of
giant that was all right but i tried
to shoot the second with nine and she
wabbled seven was enough

  you never can tell said kenny

  at four oclock the round was com-
plete it consisted of fourteen holes
set down in the rock about twenty feet
deep loaded with giant and black pow-
der kenny had let bonfire have his
way with the middle holes which are

the king row of the shot to cheer him
up it had bonfire was smiling now
like a pleased child

  some shot said he

  and his eye traveled over the orderly
array of empty dynamite cases and
black-powder cases on the bank

  count em said kenny

  i have chuckled bonfie two
hundred and four cases of sixty per
cent giant one hundred and six forty
per cent and seventy-one cans of black
enough powder he added with a
grin to knock wrhite out of the moon
at a quarter of a mile	

  it was a big shot a world of pow-
der the men said to get in fourteen
holes the rock foreman came up

  how are you fixed he asked
kenny

  look at her said kenny

  the bench was cleared for action
lengths of black fuse lay out on the
surface like the tentacles of a giant
devil-fish that had been imprisoned in
the rock showing the position of each
hole the drills had long since been
dismounted and gotten out of the way
were all ready to fire said kenny
let her go said the foreman
kenny lit a cigarette

get your men out of the cut he
said the shortest fuse is seven feet
that gives us seven minutes
nodded the foreman he eyed kenny
curiously his head down

  for the big powder man had picked
up a spare length bf fuse and was open-
ing one end with his knife this done
he touched the cut with his cigarette
light a thin stream of sparks shot
forth and kenny turned around to
bonfire who stood a little to one side
just lighting a similar fuse for himself

  take the side holes said kenny
and come across to the middle ill
take the breast holes and finish up with
the lifters

  the foreman waited no longer he


the popular magazine

turned and ran down the path his
voice was like a trumpet

  fire in the heading it rang
through the cut

  the men took up the cry their
voices rose in a kind of chant

  fire in the heading

  and like black water the bulk of the
shift rushed out on the grade carrying
the shout up on the hill you could
hear them the girl sandy paused on
the road coming down

  mccann had asked her where she
was going

	down to the grade said sandy

  have you no shame scolded the
old man those men are going to make
an end of it to-night

  i know said sandy let me pass
grandfather

  the old man peered at her for a mo-
ment  then he moved out of the door

  i promised your mother he said
slowly never to stand in your way
but think lass what people will say
its all one thing to me said sandy
and so she started down the hill to
see wfhat the end would be

  the sun was very near his setting
small red clouds floated in the western
quarter of the sky in the east there
was a warm dusk the solemn hush of
evening and a young moon rising over
the great hills

 and down on the beach the two
powder men were nearly done little
wreaths of smoke taking odd forms in
the soft light lifted their heads all over
the rock there was no sound save a
sudden exclamation from one or the
other of the two men when something
went wrong and occasionally down in
the cut the voice of the rock foreman
raised in some argument with the drill
runners who were waiting there for
kenny and bonfire

  the latter squatted over one of the
middle holes and within arms length
knelt kenny in some difficulty with the
last of the lifters the fuse which was

a short one had slipped back into the
hole

  with an exclamation he sat back and
looked around for a miners spoon
there one lay the long shank half
buried in sand on the other side of the
bench there was no time to get up
and get it so kenny thrust his hand
into the hole and felt for the evasive
fuse the hole was only a little bigger
around than his wrist but kenny got
his hand in somehow and located the
end of the fuse with the tips of his
fingers presently he got a good hold
of it and started to pull his hand out
of the hole

  at this moment bonfire stood up
threw down his improvised fuse and
stamped it out carefully there was
enough fire on the rock

  come on said he

  wait a minute muttered kenny

  bonfire walked over kennys back
was turned but the other could see he
was tugging at something

  im all done said bonfire whats
the matter

  kenny sat back he breathed in once
hard

  nothing said he i got my hand
caught thats all

  quit your kidding said bonfire

  i aint kidding you said kenny
look

  bonfire bent over one glance was
enough

  my crimson oath he said slowly
thats a fine place to put your hand

  kenny tugged at it

  she tried to get away from me he
said fiercely

  eh  said bonfire bending over

  that blooming fuse said kenny in
reply

  i caught my hand like that once
said bonfire staring when i was a
kid it was in a pitcher and they had
to break it

  kenny glared down at the rock and
eased his wrist in the hole
fire in the heaving



  its the same thing said he only
this pitcher is big as all outdoors

  pull on it once bonfire said
thickly  here let me get a hold of you

  but kenny waved him back

  if anybody could pull it out he
said i could and i cant make up my
mind to leaving any more skin in this
hole

  a voice came up from the cut

  hey it said are you fellows go-
ing to take all night

  bonfire ran to the head of the path

  come up here a minute said he

  the rock foreman appeared with
three drill runners at his heels the
situation spoke for itself the foreman
shook his head

  youre just as good as dead he
said briskly

  huh said kenny

  take a slant at that said the other

  kenny turned suddenly smoke stood
thick on the rock an ominous curtain
shrouded the bench hanging waist-high
like a pall when kenny turned again
his dark face had lost a shade and
about the tight mouth there were two
new lines that made you think some-
how of medieval knights and sudden
death

  well said he you lads better be
slinking your hook

  the rock foreman coughed

 somebody get me a pick he
snapped

  ill go said one of the men eagerly
bonfire looked after him with a sneer

  something tells me said he that
cockie wicks wont come back

  neither would i growled one of
the others you know as well as i do
there aint a pick to be had now this
side of the powder magazine which
was a good quarter of a mile

 every man for himself said
kenny

  thats the old rule said the rock
foreman but i-

  do me a favor kenny said shortly

  give it a name said the other and
kenny looked up at bonfire

  take him with you he said

  bonfire wet his lips he had been
looking for something like this these
three men who were going to run for
their lives would waste a lot of time
trying to take him with them

  if you let me alone said he ill
go first

  which he did without another word
showing the way down the path kenny
looked up presently

  he might have said good-by he
said to the mountain and somebody
laughed

  it was bonfire standing at the head
of the path-a bit out of breath but
his own man again and kenny said

  oh its you is it

  i came back said bonfire

  where did you leave the others 
kenny wanted to know

  at the bottom of the path they
came down one by one i wanted an
even break that was all so i came
back said bonfire to make you a lit-
tle proposition

  you wouldnt bargain with a dead
man 

 youre good for any man-from
where you sit-till you draw your last
breath youre the kind that can al-
ways come back you proved that this
morning and i aint going to take any
more chances let me finish blackie
kenny im going to bargain with you
for your life and itll be a good bar-
gain for me whether you say yes or no
i want you to get out of this camp on
the night work train and if she aint
called for six oclock i want you to
walk out

  somebodyll have to pull this load
first said kenny

  ill do it said bonfire

  kenny looked at him curiously
among rock men even with a flying
start this was considered the task of
tasks


the popular magazine

  you must want that girl pretty bad
he said

  shes got in my eyes bonfire said
simply just like the sun

  well then argued kenny why
dont you go away and leave me to the
shot 

  bonfire looked hurt

  why i wouldnt let a dog die like
thathe said look here

  he strode to the first side hole he
knew almost to the stick how much
giant powder it contained but his hand
held no tremor as he inserted the spoon
and coolly dug out the hissing fuse
how does she stand asked kenny
bonfire dragged out the whole length
a yellow stick of giant powder followed
it like a plummet this was the primer
and contained a fulminate cap which
clamped the fuse at one end bonfire
stood up reading the black length as
you would a strip of tape from a ticker

  oh youve got about four minutes
he said snapping the fust below the
spark what dyou say

  no said kenny

  yes said another voice and sandy
mccann stood at the top of the path
binding her yellow hair in the dusk
she was very pale as one after a long
run and quite calm her right sleeve
was ripped to the shoulder and the
whole arm showed smooth rounded
lovely

  a drill runner brought the news
down the grade she explained and
ive been standing here a full minute
getting my breath

  who tore your dress  bonfire de-
manded suddenly as if that were all
the trouble

  a man said the girl i met three
of them coming into the cut but the
other two didnt stop

  kenny stared at her over his shoul-
der something gradually washing his
face of color he jerked his head at
bonfire

  get her out of this he said
hoarsely get her out of this man 
bonfire turned to the girl

  you heard what i said she told
him you can make your bargain
with me

  no said kenny he shouted it
at them

  hush  said the girl ive made up
my mind

  bonfire stood over him

  you cant stop me he said

  huh  said kenny 

  bonfire sprang back and the impris-
oned man reached for his leg and
missed he fell forward his free hand
stabbing the air he drew back tugging
furiously at the rock until the smoke
and pain choked him down to his
haunches again he sat there gazing
wistfully at the red-headed man who
now knelt over the second side hole

  the fuse here had been cut a foot
longer than the first but by now the
spark had burned down to the three-
minute mark for bonfires knife blade
nicked it at a point just three feet from
the primer this you might say rep-
resented his handicap on the whole
round which had been timed tt fire at
one-minute intervals each hole bon-
fire knew contained a fuse trimmed one
foot longer than the last there were
twelve holes to go-no eleven count-
ing out the one in which kenny had
caught his hand he had his handicap
and must keep it or death would be in
good season of course every-second
held the chance of a faulty fuse and a
sight of eternity but by the same token
fate and manufacture as stars in har-
mony might smother a spark and re-
turn life in a squib

  bonfire gained nothing at the third
hole here- he sat back calling sandy
to bring him the spoon which he had
left behind she came quickly and
knelt beside him watching him work
and thereafter she followed him from
hole to hole fascinated perhaps by the
fire in the heaving



speed of his hands and a dawning reali-
zation of the dearness of things

  there was just enough light to see by
-between the rose of evening and the
glory of the moon and a fresh young
wind now and then to take care of the
smoke

  bonfire picked up a minute at the
first breast hole and lost it at the sec-
ond the fuse evaded him cunningly
and the rock seemed determined to hold
it fast bonfire cursed the rock en-
dearing it with the same breath for
of a sudden the fuse came willingly to
his hands it was this way with every-
thing  fuse fire powder rock and
spoon he personified them all array-
ing himself against these things as if
they not he were possessed for luck
he spat on his palms and rapped the
face of the rock with the spoon to make
them both behave

  at intervals now he laughed and
sang it was as one passing the nadir
of a frenzy he would pull the load all
right of that much he was certain
eight holes lay behind him robbed of
their fire and the honors were almost
even the last breast hole told him
that his knife gashed the spark a good
two feet and a half above the primer
bonfire showed the fuse to the girl call-
ing her woman and laughed again in
gay excitement the word thrilled her
but it was only a flash and left her a
little puzzled and sad though she still
sat by and handed the man what he
wanted she followed him about as
one walking through a dream yet if he
dropped his knife she picked it up and
felt it a duty to keep the spoon ever
under his hand

  thus they came to the lifters there
were three of them but only two holes
smoked and kenny sat with his right
hand in the farthest

  the fuses were long and close to the
rock yet bonfire gained nothing here
he had to take his time and watch

where he moved because kenny was fo
close

  the latter however sat watching him
quietly and made no hostile sign

  how are they coming he asked

  bonfire showed him

  theres only the three middle holes
left he said and we got something
over two minutes

  kenny nodded

  theyre full of black powder he
said but a man ought to know his own
tamping he didnt look at the girl

  bonfire had begun on the first middle
hole but sandy still knelt before the
last lifter where he had left her she
watched kenny curiously his face
drawn pale haggard even like those at
the end of a long vigil the girl thought
of physical pain and no doubt she
imagined she understood all the misery
he was suffering and yearned to go to
him and comfort him as only the woman
he loves can comfort a man but she
didnt she only sat there and looked
at him sullenly for he wouldnt look
at her he sat with his head turned
looking at bonfire his expression that
of a man watching a climax in which
he intends to share

  his profile was quiet yet every line
spelled alert daring and great hardi-
hood of soul and the big jaw was set
like a plowshare

  the middle holes ran through the
center of the bench they had been set
down about six feet apart the last one
or the one nearest to kenny being set
out a little owing to a fault in the rock
so bonfire reaching here at length al-
most faced kenny who sat a little
aside near enough had he wished to
reach out with his free hand and touch
the other on the shoulder but kenny
sat motionless with eyes that looked at
nothing and seemed to see everything
he moved once easing his wrist in the
rock and the girl watching him knew
in a blinding flash of the intuition god
gave to all women and some men what


the popular magazine

his next move would be what would
happen she had no idea she felt a
strange lightness her thoughts flying
out of her head like feathers out of a
bag this much is certain-she re-
tained  thought of warning bonfire
she could only sit and wait which is
what women are for

  bonfire worked deliberately now it
was the last hole of the round and no
use taking chances the fuse judging
from the one before should be about
two feet long now and a reasonable
hazard he inserted the spoon care-
fully holding the long shank lightly in
his left hand the elbow out in his
right hand he held his knife ready to
cut the moving spark his work was
good there was  lost motion no fal-
ter of hand or eye he had forgotten
the girl kenny everything he was
on the edge of his triumph making his-
tory men would talk of this thing for
a long time sitting around red-hot
stoves when the bunk house was
drowsy with old songs and rock men
singing

  his face told kenny when the spoon
at length clipped the burning fuse but
there it had slipped away again the
red-headed man sat back and unmind-
ful of the girl spoke in a loud voice

  theres plenty of timd he added to
kenny but this thing gets on a fel-
lows nerves

  i should say it does said kenny

  bonfire returned to his task but
now try as he would the spoon only
brought up sand sweat poured down
his face he could feel it welling under
his armpits and streaming down his
breast it soaked him and his throat
felt dry as a street in the sun mean-
while a little pile of white sand grew
beside the hole bonfire glanced at it
once saw a few black grains on the
peak and slowly went red which was
his way of turning pale it meant only
one thing he was down to the load
his tamping gone and only a few inches

of fuse between spark and powder
blackpowder at that the hole stopped
smoking all of a sudden which was an-
other bad sign wait he had it  no
yes that was it

  it was then as bonfire raised the fuse
with a touch light as a feather that
somebody suddenly took hold of his
elbow

  got it said kenny over his free
arm

  uh-huh said bonfire it was all
he could say

  well said kenny ive got you

  his voice was steady enough but his
eyes seemed to catch fire and blaze up

  my crimson oath said bonfire
leggo 

  kennys grip tightened gently

  put down that knife said he
there if you move again your old
black powder will be the death of us
all

  bonfire relaxed he loved life there
was nothing else to do the sun was
setting and he wanted to see it again
that was all

  well  said he

  turn and turn about said kenny
you was making bargains a while back
now ill have my say

  the girl came toward them creeping
across the rock on her hands and knees
her face a white blur in the half light

  go on said bonfire thinking of the
burning fuse and kingdom come

  to go back to where we were in the
beginning said kenny and let the
girl make up her mind when she gets
good and ready    make that a
bargain i say or well all start for
heaven on the shot

  fair enough bonfire said without
hesitation

  what dyou mean said kenny

  ill take my chance said the other
with sandy now leggo 

  kenny leaned back bonfire put a lit-
tle purchase on the spoon and directly
he grabbed something from the hole
fire in the heading



he held it away from his face a yellow
stick of giant with a tiny wisp of white
smoke curling from a black stub at one
end he reached wildly for his knife

  throw it said kenny

  this bonfire did without further
argument the little stick fiew out into
the cut suddenly exploding with a
short whiplike roar

  in the silence a few pebbles loosened
by the vibration could be heard rattling
one after the other down the side of
the mountain

  pretty close said kenny

  bonfire stood up and brushed his
knees i tell you said he i could
feel it going off in my hands

  the girl had arisen a little ways off
and now stood watching them a little
uncertain perhaps what she should do
she was in a kind of trouble so would
you be if you were young and a
woman

  kenny addressed her for the first
time you have beautiful hair he
said suddenly

  sandy discovered that it was undone
and a trifle confused she began to braid
it before them recovering somewhat in
the feel of the long cool bands ive
heard that before said she

  a bit of sun it was the last thrust
along the rock and touched her face
then his and the other man watched
them standing in the shadow

  it shines like gold said kenny
she shook out a strand to catch the
light  but like that it had gone

  it only reaches to my waist said
sandy

  bonfire cleared his throat come
things were getting away from him

  i wonder he said pleasantly if
well get to pull shot again to-night yet

  kenny looked around

  i dont see why not said he if
i had a pick or something i could break
my fist out of this hole myself

  bonfire started for the path

  ill go down and call the men
said he

  he stopped suddenly and looked
back at the girl as a man sure of
himself

  come on he said

  she hesitated

  it was casual enough all of it but
worthy of note is the casual especially
wherein it cross-sections the movement
of instinct which is the movement of
life

  kenny spoke to her

  go on if you like said he

  sandy dropped her lids

  no she said in a low voice let
me stay

  that was all yet oddly enough
kenny showed no surprise and the man
bonfire seemed to be learning all its
misery

  i knew it said kenny

  well wouldnt that kill you said
bonfire

  he spoke aloud but neither kenny
nor the girl appeared to hear him for
kenny was looking at sandy and sandy
was looking at the west which had sud-
denly become splendid all red and gold
like a marriage pageant

  bonfire turned presently and started
down into the cut sandy must have
turned at once for bonfire heard her
say to kenny

  tell me something

 and kenny

  id tell you anything

  how did you know sandy asked
him and bonfire stopped for kennys
reply

  ha said kenny a man with his
neck in a noose learns a whole lot about
women in two minutes

  bonfire started on again

  oh i dont know he said to the
mountain
a motion-picture hero

by william holloway

the motion-picture fan represented by the office boy -and the anti-motion-
picture fanatic represented by the boss are brought together by an almost
unbelievable happening that proved the office boy was right and the boss wrong

nobody really knows what
would happen should an irre-
sistible force meet an immov-
able body though the problem
is one that has fascinated the human
mind for centuries indeed in various
secluded retreats throughout the coun-
try thousands of earnest gentlemen in
strait-jackets are devoting their lives
to a solution of this very question
which will excuse jimmy lannigans
interest in the subject

  not that jimmy-office boy of the-
ophilus dawson the great philanthro-
pist-had ever heard of irresistible
forces or immovable bodies but when
a boy is crazy about the movies and
his employer has a grim determination
to wipe the whole motion-picture indus-
try from the face of the earth there
surely is in evidence a situation not un-
like that which gives the strait-jacketed
gentlemen food for thought

  the curious part of it all was that
theophilus dawson never even sus-
pected that the hateful movies had an
adherent in his very office tall gray
austere with a rooted distrust of his
fellow mans ability to choose his pleas-
sures wisely theophilus dawson had
drifted inevitably and naturally into an-
tagonism to the aggressive and energetic
film industry

  at first he had contented himself with
letters of protest to the more conserva-
tive newspapers and with an occasional
contribution to the funds of the anti-

vice society then came the alarming
discovery that an east side boy had
stolen a nickel to view a western
movie and straightway the city or
that part of it represented by theoph-
ilus dawson was ablaze for reform

  in the campaign that ensued the-
ophilus dawson took a prominent part
pie it was who presided at the monster
anti-motion-picture rally in carnegie
hall his money gave financial backing
to the nation-wide attack on the film in-
dustry his views eagerly sought by
avid reporters were spread broadcast
throughout the landin a word the-
ophilus dawson by one of the whimsies
of fate came to his own all of which
combined to make jimmy lannigans
position peculiar	

  jimmy was fifteen red-haired frec-
kled with a glint of humor in his gray
eyes and a laugh spontaneous enough
to melt the heart of a janitor and in-
duce him to turn on steam he lived
with his mother in one of those rear
three-room uptown flats where the air
shafts are so narrow that a stay of
merely three minutes at an air-shaft
window will enable a woman to qualify
as an expert in the domestic affairs of
half her neighbors which explains
why the air-shaft window flourishes
in spite of building reforms 

  jimmys greatest pleasure as hereto-
fore intimated consisted in visiting the
motion-picture shows let there be no
mistake about this theophilus daw-
a motion-picture hero



sons office boy far from sharing his
employers hatred of the fascinating
films actually gloried in them other
boys might have their great men their
cobbs their speakers their brickleys
their ted merediths but for jimmy
lannigan the world of heroes was
bounded by the flickering canvas
whereon the leading men of the photo-
play world went through their won-
drous evolutions

  he knew them all by heart-wilbur
costello fielding anderson blackwell
bushman kerrigan mitchell knew
them in wild west thrillers in down
east romances on the prairies in draw-
ing-rooms in offices in banks saw them
facing dangers with a smile laughing
at accidents making a fool of disaster
and bending forward in his seat he
worshiped at their shrine

  this was in the evening the morn-
ing brought disillusionment there was
theophilus dawson to be encountered
his prim austere face antagonistic to
the very mention of jimmys heroes
there were messages to be carried-mes-
sages as he well knew to other cru-
saders in the anti-movie cause there
was to be faced a whole atmosphere
hostile to the things he loved where-
fore it was that jimmy lannigan at
times caught himself wondering what
would really happen if theophilus daw-
son discovered the traitor in his camp
the question of an irresistible force
meeting an immovable body never-as
has been said-entered jimmys mind
the situation to him was very simple
will he fire me or will he not
and sad to relate of a man of such
really fine instincts as theophilus daw-
son the office boys decision was in fa-
vor of the expeditious mode of depar-
ture known as getting fired

  if one believes the old proverb every
cloud will be observed to have a silver
lining the beauty of this proverb lies
in its truth virginia dawson was the

silver lining in jimmy lannigans storm
cloud

  on second thoughts silver is too poor
a substance to compare to virginia
dawson if she must be likened to a
metal let it be the very purest gold
but indeed i have an idea that even
refined gold is hopelessly inadequate
to represent a good woman so why
not think as jimmy did that she was
the essence of sunshine  it is true that
jimmy never put his thought into
words but it was there nevertheless
in the recesses of his brain from the un-
forgettable morning when he first saw
virginia dawson blue-eyed sunny-
haired frank and smiling enter her
fathers grim office and to receive a
nod as she passed him could there
be greater bliss

  there was a world of humor in vir-
ginia dawson of which her austere fa-
ther never dreamed there was more-
over a ready sympathy and gift of in-
tuition which led her straight to the
heart of the boys secret it happened
one day when the girl-she was in the
early twenties-was sitting in her fa-
thers office listening to one of his end-
less harangues against the motion-pic-
ture evil jimmy lannigan chanced to
be standing near by waiting for a let-
ter and the restless twitching of his
shoulders as he listened told the observ-
ant girl his secret

  as they passed into the hall she
flashed him a glance laughing quiz-
zical sympathetic so jimmy she
smiled you like the pictures do you

  it needed only one look at her face
to make jimmy understand some-
thing vaguely indistinct in his mind a
feeling he could not analyze told him
that this girl might be trusted with the
secrets of the whole world and that she
would never betray her trust

  you bet i like em he whispered
one eye on the office door do you 

  she shook her head and jimmys
heart sank was it possible that a girl


the popular magazine

like that-a real corker if ever there
was one-could fail to enjoy the swift
realistic motion of the filmed faces
across the canvas that she could fail
to respond to the tantalizing lure of
viewing plot action life itself develop
before her very eyes then his heart
gave a bound she was speaking

  i have never been to the pictures
she said slowly so you see i cant
say whether or not i care for them
id like to go-ever so much but it
would make father unhappy so i stay
at home

  jimmy nodded wisely and a profound
sense of his own superior opportunities
soothed him i go every night he
declared proudly

  then tell me about them said the
girl giving her chauffeur a signal to
wait

  thus admonished jimmy told the
story of the movies as he knew it
told of stern-faced indomitable heroes
of bewitching on-the-level heroines of
scheming villains avho invariably ended
in disgrace of strange cities and peo-
ple of western mining camps of life
upon the borders of the mysterious des-
ert sea as she listened the girl found
herself interested in spite of herself-
interested not only in jimmys story but
in the boy himself-in his sparkling
gray eyes his tousled red hair the eager
admiration that seemed to cover him
as a garment

  thats fine jimmy she said finally
with a smile another day i must hear
more only if i were you i shouldnt
talk about it in the office

  as before said jimmy lannigan had
never heard of immovable bodies or ir-
resistible forces yet at her words there
came into his mind a dim conception of
the world-old problem at which the gen-
tlemen in strait-jackets are toiling
talk about it in the office he re-
peated not on your life miss vir-
ginia

  this was the beginning of a long se-

ries of talks between jimmy and his
employers daughter which caused
jimmy to feel as if he was walking on
air and the girl herself was curiously
pleased at the boys delight when one
is the very essence of sunshine-the
warm beneficent sunshine-why not
pass some of it along not that the
girl ever thought of herself in terms as
complimentary as these she merely
happened to be one of those people
whose great delight it is to make life
pleasant for others which after all
is not a bad sort of disposition to have

  it was virginia dawsons habit to call
for her father each afternoon promptly
at four and beguile him with a spin in
her motor jimmy lannigan watchful
of the hour was always on hand to open
the door of the high-powered machine
and to receive a smile of thanks and a
cheery word about the movies before
she passed into the elevator which
considering the atmosphere of her fa-
thers office was manna to the boys
hungry soul and then quite of a sud-
den-that is to say with the advent of
count de ramillies-jimmys pleasure
came to an abrupt end for the count
who had an ardent impetuosity of tem-
perament entirely un-american gener-
ally contrived to be loitering by the
curbstone each afternoon at four when
miss dawson arrived which makes it
needless to add that jimmy was no
longer permitted to open the door of
the machine

  jimmys attitude toward the new
scheme of things was not enthusiastic
his admiration for the count was by no
means boundless indeed he disliked
him as heartily and generously as a boy
always dislikes the man who dares raise
presumptuous eyes to his youthful god-
dess nor was this the only reason
there was another which jimmy could
not have put into words if he had tried
perhaps the easiest way to phrase it is
to say that the count in jimmys opin-
ion quite failed to look the part tall
a motion-cplctutrb hbro

 

well dressed distinguished looking-
the boy granted he was all these but
there should have been a frank open
look in his eyes instead of a furtive one
and he should not have sworn at a
newsboy for making an error in chang-
ing a dime above all he should never
have grown impatient while waiting at
street corners for miss dawson

  and it was a fact that he grew impa-
tient that he walked restlessly to and
fro if she wtere the least bit later than
usual in appearing-all of which jimmy
considered rather out of place even
though their wedding had been an-
nounced for the early fall jimmys
idea of the proper method of proce-
dure in such a case-as exemplified by
his moving-picture heroes-consisted of
calm dignified waiting until the fair one
arrived and then in one or two speech-
less looks of devotion which he had
nqticed invariably did the business the
count de ramillies by not conforming
to the codeof the movies lost all pres-
tige with jimmy except of course such
prestige as the boy grudgingly ad-
mitted would be due him as miss vir-
ginias husband

  it was on a friday morning at ten-
thirty-three to be exact and on the
morning of miss virginias wedding
day to be more exact still that the
question of the irresistible force and the
immovable body unexpectedly became
a practical one for jimmy lannigan
jimmy said theophilus dawson on
the fateful morning above mentioned
run over to ziggins  heiter with
this cut-glass tumbler tell them i
sent you they will know what to do

  jimmy took the glass in hand yes
sir said he promptly

  the great philanthropist swung about
in his swivel chair by the way
jimmy he said kindly you might like
to look at the design it is really a fine
piece of work and a boy of your age
ought to be taking an interest in ar-
tistic things

 a

  yes sir said jimmy and fell to
examining it

  theophilus dawson watched him be-
nevolently he belonged to that large
class who are always willing to give
their fellow creatures pleasure pro-
vided it costs nothing never saw any-
thing like that i suppose jimmy

  the boys face kindled with admira-
tion as he turned the tumbler in his
hand it is very fine he said but
not so fine as the one they made for
the president lately

  theophilus dawson grew grave he
was not quite sure that the president
had a right to receive a piece of cut
glass finer than his own did you see
the one made for the president
jimmy 

  yes sir cried jimmy lannigan

eagerly i saw it in the moving-

he paused sharply while his employer
held up an accusing finger

  speak out boy was the sharp
command moving what

  jimmy lannigan looked helplessly
about him the ceiling was whirling
around in a fantasy of pale blue and
white the persian rug on the parquet
floor had grown enormously larger than
usual and was stretching out long slen-
der arms to the surbase while tables
and chairs seemed to be dancing a
devils dance on nothing

  moving what repeated his em-
ployer sharply

  jimmy lannigan gasped for breath
and on the instant the ceiling stopped
its whirling the persian rug shrank to
normal size the tables and chairs ceased
their gyrations as he turned to face his
employers accusing eye never in
jimmys experience had he seen the
equal of that fixed compelling blue
eye to the boys gaze it loomed al-
most as large as the headlight of an en-
gine he took one fleeting glance then
swung back his shoulders as he had
seen maurice costello crane wilbur


the popular magazine

anderson and the rest do in times of
danger

  i saw it in the moving pictures
sir

   there was a long silence as theoph-
ilus dawson gazed at his guilty office
boy the great man was shocked to the
innermost fiber of his being and 
you consider the circumstances you
cant altogether blame him there he
was devoting his life to combating
something which he considered a great
public evil and here was his office boy

	openly avowing his addiction to the
hated amusement and this in spite of
the hundreds of times he had heard the
whole wretched business denounced in
this very office manifestly an exam-
ple would have to be made

   jimmy said his employer sorrow-
fully come here

   regarding the events of the next ten
minutes this chronicle is silent the-
ophilus dawson spoke at length husk-
ily because he liked the boy but very
firmly then jimmy lannigan tucked
his weeks salary into his pocket and
walked out into the clear october sun-
shine he no longer had a position
but on the other hand he possessed a
very clear idea of the problem which
puzzles the gentlemen in strait-jackets
he knew exactly what happens when an
irresistible force meets an immovable
body

   on the curb he paused irresolutely
he had forgotten that he still had his
office key never mind he would
give it to the stenographer when she
came out there was a small park
across the street-one of the frag-
mentary bits of green that dot the des-
ert of new york-where he often used
to eat his midday sandwich now from
sheer habit he crossed the street and
sat down on one of the benches

   but to sit on a park bench when one
is a cog in the great workaday machine
of life and to sit there as an idler are
two different things as jimmy pres-

  ently found out the minutes passed
while he sat brooding his eyes fixed on
the door of the office building through
which he had just passed it was very
lonely so lonely that when mr daw-
sons touring car drew up at the curb
jimmy watched it with a hungry look
and when theophilus dawson tall
slender aristocratic had taken his place
and the machine had purred on its way
the boy felt a distinct sinking sensation
as though parting with something very
precious-which would have surprised
theophilus dawson immensely then
the fair-haired stenographer-who with
jimmy had constituted the philanthro-
pists modest office force-appeared
upon the sidewalk

  jimmy approached her sorrowfully
finished miss roberts

  she gave him a kindly smile - just
finished his speech for to-night she ex-
plained the wedding speech i mean
why it was fierce he changed it
twenty times and if the guests are
alive when he finishes reading it-
miss roberts raised her neatly gloved
hands in air-well all i can say is im
sorry

   hope its a happy wedding said
jimmy moodily somehow i dont like
those counts

  neither does your aunt eliza said
miss roberts firmly an american
for me even if he is a dishwasher
she nodded her dainty little head
swung northward on the avenue and
was lost in the crowrd before jimmy
had time to remember that he still held
the key of the office in his pocket

  with a doleful smile that was al-
most a grimace the boy strolled back
to his bench only to be confronted by
miss dawsons pictured semblance in a
newspaper a passer-by had flung there
his face lit up with pleasure as he
noted the heading young couple get-
ting license yesterday then he spread
the paper open so that the picture of
the count de ramillies showed beside
a motion-eplcture hero



that of the bride elect after which
jimmy lannigan whistled softly and
grew pale

  it is one thing the initiated will tell
you to see a man upon the street and
quite another to view him with the ruth-
less eye of the camera the difference
in the present case was so great that
jimmy lannigan turned momentarily
dizzy how had he failed to notice it
before he asked himself savagely
when he had seen the man dozens of
times

  he turned on his heel with a wild
resolution to make his way to the penn-
sylvania station and take a long island
train to the dawson home he had his
weeks salary in his pocket so that the
sinews of war were already provided
for he paused a minute what was
the dawsons station jimmy frowned
at the question it was strange that he
had never heard it garden city or
oyster bay well what difference
he had a tongue in his mouth and any
conductor on the long island railroad
would know theophilus dawson and
shaking his head with decision he
stepped upon the sidewalk only to be
confronted with a miracle

  for the count de ramillies was
walking down the street frock-coated
gardeniaed debonair behind him came
a servant with a suit case and for the
first time the boy noticed that traffic had
come to a halt and that other passen-
gers were pouring out of stalled auto-
mobiles intent on making the pennsyl-
vania station on foot

  there is one admirable trait common
to heroes of motion pictures given
the most trying problem in the world
and they never delay in its solution
more than a couple of seconds i have
often timed them in situations that
would have puzzled the keenest intel-
lect but never have i observed any of
them hesitate any longer than it takes
the operator to turn the crank of the
machine jimmy lannigan steeped in

the atmosphere of the movies hesitated
no longer than one of his own heroes

  in an instant he was standing before
count de ramillies his brain on fire
with a stupendous thought

  message from mr dawson sir
he said sharply

  the tall frock-coated figure paused
impressively his heavy-lidded dark
eyes examined the speaker with a scru-
tiny that was startling in its keenness
ah  the office boy of monsieur daw-
son is it not

  sure mike replied jimmy lanni-
gan with reckless disregard for truth
the boss left something for you in the
office was sending me over to the rail-
road to get you

  a package a letter asked the
frenchman hurriedly what could he
leave for me

  a package answered jimmy un
blushingly it was a surprise he
wanted you to have before you went
down to the country said he couldnt
give it to you down there too many
rubbernecks around

  well hurry up and get it was the
impatient rejoinder i cant wait here
long

  jimmys eyes were quite guileless as
he gazed up at the eager almost wolfish
face above him

  that package has gotta be signed
for mister that aint no bunch of
christmas presents from the five-and-
ten-cent store no sir the boss
went down to the bank himself to get it
believe me its some package

  the counts dark eyes dilated with
pleasurable emotion and the hand that
stroked his short dark mustache ac-
tually trembled he made a sign to
the man who was carrying his suit case
wait here until i come he said curlly
and to jimmy he added all right
hurry up

  a minute later they stood before a
door the glass upper half of which bore


the popular magazine

the magic letters theophilus dawson
private

  jimmy unlocked the door with the
key he had forgotten to return earlier
in the day and the two entered the de-
serted office there were two rooms
opening into each other both looking
upon the street in the second of these
wras the mahogany roll-top desk which
belonged to the great philanthropist and
beside it a small flat table also ma-
hogany the count pushed into the
room his eyes flashing with impatience
i see nothing he cried with a ring
of disappointment where did you say
it was

  but jimmy lannigan had had too
much experience of the movies not to
be dramatic his right hand slipped
gingerly into the drawer of the flat
table emerging with a revolver which
he leveled at the frenchmans chest
put up yer hands came his cheerful
invitation

  the count de ramillies gazed blankly
at the end of the very businesslike re-
volver then he shrugged his shoulders
are you crazy he askecthoarsely

  put up yer hands was the savage
answer now-or im going to shoot

  for an instant the man hesitated
then a look at the boys set face and
flashing eyes convinced him of the folly
of delay slowly reluctantly he held
up his hands

  you will pay for this he cried fu-
riously where is the package

  isnt any was the tranquil reply

  the very absurdity of the situation
calmed the victim so you brought
me here for a joke boy he said
slowly dont you understand i am
the count de ramillies  and that im
going to marry your employers daugh-
ter this evening

  wrong three times affirmed jimmy
lannigan i lost my job so i have
no employer get that then if i
have no boss how can my boss daugh-
ter get married  silly question number

two then as to being a count-

jimmy laughed scornfully say i saw
yer picture in the paper and i knowed
ye yer no real count yer a play-
acting count-the fellow that used to
play the imitation french count in the
unigraph films

  the face of the count de ramillies
had grown a beautifully livid green
his eyes darted fire you lie you las-
cal he cried sharply canaille
jimmy lannigan smiled a calmly su-
perior smile you can get me mister
on that french talk maybe but when
it comes to the movies-huh -youre
not putting nothing over on your uncle
not if he knows it i seen you dozens
of times in the unigraph films and
say maybe yer didnt give me a pain
ye bum actor

  its a lie shrieked the actor furi-
ously i tell you its a lie

  oh no it isnt said jimmy more
calmly still i seen yer picture in the
paper i tell ye and i know that put
me hep to ye quicks a flash he threw
back his shoulders with a gesture that
he had often witnessed in the hero of
the movies im wise to ye old boy
wise dye see

  manifestly the man did for he grew
suddenly silent staring at boy and re-
volver in an odd impersonal way as
though he were engaged in the solu-
tion of a difficult problem

  youve got me he said finally got
me dead to rights it was clever of you
i admit it he smiled ingratiatingly
but look here ive no quarrel with
you and you have none with me sup-
pose you let me go well ill marry
miss dawson wont i  and ill give
you twenty dollars a week for the rest
of your life how about that

  twenty plunks a week jimmys
voice was hushed with awe  gee
twenty bucks he repeated his eyes
round with amazement that sure is
going some for me

  the man in the frock coat made a
a motion-picture hero



step forward then youll take it
he asked anxiously

  take it exclaimed his captor
not in a million years but it sure
makes a feller throw a chest

  the very gardenia in the adventurers
coat seemed to wilt at the rebuff his
shoulders drooped then what on
earth do you intend to do boy said
he wearily

  keep you here until its too late for
the ceremony said jimmy politely
after that-he shook his head sol-
emnly-well see

  so saying the boy backed toward the
door locked it with one hand while he
covered his captive with the other put
the key in his pocket and motioned to-
ward a chair

  sit down frenchy he advised
kindly youll get tired out standing
and the day is young

  if black looks could kill a healthy
office boy jimmy lannigans days
would surely have been numbered but
as a mere matter of fact he was quite
oblivious of his captives scowling face
for the telephone bell was ringing
shrilly and insistently which rather
complicated matters

  to ignore the call was of course the
safest thing to do yet suppose-just
suppose-it were miss dawson herself 
she might think her father still in the
office and in that case-jimmy hesi-
tated no longer the revolver in his
right hand covering his captive he
caught the receiver in his left hello 
he called

  that it was not miss dawson jimmy
knew at once who it really was he
never found out for at that precise
instant the hand which was holding the
revolver accidentally collided with the
telephone instrument there was a clat-
ter and the revolver fell harmlessly be-
hind the roll-top desk quite out of
reach of both occupants of the room

  jimmys face was a study as he put
up the receiver and faced his adver-

sary-no longer a cringing coward but
a man who seemed suddenly to loom
immense in the narrow office now
you guttersnipe he heard a far-off
voice say savagely and he dimly rea-
lized that the big mass of the man was
hurling itself toward him give me
the key

  for an instant jimmys heart gave an
exultant bound he had the key and
until he lost it miss dawson was safe
with a side step a champion boxer
would have envied he slipped by his
bulky antagonist and ran to the far end
of the office with a surprisingly quick
turn the actor followed there was an
instants dodging then he had jimmy
by the arm

  that key he cried angrily that
key

  sometimes the hero of the motion pic-
ture is in dire straits his hopes blasted
the villain confronting him in triumph
on such occasions does he whimper 
or yield not perceptibly jimmy re-
called in fact a perfectly hopeless
situation generally acts as a spur upon
the heros inventive powers with this
thought in mind jimmy promptly drove
his head into his opponents stomach
while with his right foot he kicked him
squarely on the shins

  you rascal cried the real rascal
flinging the boy upon the floor and
clutching him by the throat give me
that key

  it may be doubted if any motion-pic-
ture hero was ever in a worse predica-
ment than that of jimmy lannigan
the mans weight was so great that at
times the boy felt sure his chest must
break his throat was caught in an iron
grip that showed him the folly of fur-
ther resistance and yet where a wiser
man would give up the office boy fought
on raining ineffectual blows upon the
actors face squirming struggling kick-
ing without the smallest thought of
yielding once twice the man loosened
his grasp to reach for the key only to


the ppulcr magazine

find himself attacked with such savage
fury that he speedily realized that be-
fore anything else could be done the
boy must be beaten into submission in
the next few minutes jimmy lannigan
seemed to himself to live several life-
times he was dimly conscious that an
overpowering force was slowly master-
ing him yet regardless of terrible pun-
ishment-he fought on then with-
out warning the door clicked open and
theophilus dawson stood upon the
threshold

  count de ramillies he cried aghast
he took a step forward and his aston-
ished gaze fell upon his discharged of-
fice boy now a rather gruesome spec-
tacle and jimmy lannigan he
turned to his intended son-in-law i
came back because i forgot my wedding
speech and to find you in this condi-
tion-- he paused abruptly as

count de ramillies scrambled to his
feet

  the counts silk hat was gone the
wreck of it fronting him from the per-
sian rug gone too was the gardenia
and with it a section of his coat collar
while from his split lips a tiny red
stream trickled down his chin all in
all he presented a very different appear-
ance from that of the debonair gentle-
man whom jimmy had stopped upon the
avenue

  the boy locked me in he said furi-
ously and i was trying to get the key
from him

  yes said theophilus dawson in-
credulously he looked at the battered
wreck that had once been jimmy lan-
nigan now scrambling to his feet you
shouldnt have hurt the boy he com-
mented gravely

  jimmy lannigan with difficulty
opened one eye when the motion-pic-
ture hero finishes his fight there is al-
ways a girl to gaze admiringly at him
this was a part of the program poor
jimmy missed oh he didnt hurt

me he cried through swollen lips
i wasnt going to let him go down to
marry miss virginia because he aint no
real count hes the feller that used
to play the counts part in the unigraph
films his name is peter kistler he
laid a hand on theophilus dawsons
arm look at him he asked thickly

  but there wras no need of further
proof with a face livid with baffled
passion the exposed adventurer was
slipping out of the room mr dawson
watched him silently his own face very
grave until the door banged behind him

  youve seen him in the-the-mo-
tion pictures he stammered

  dozens of times was the prompt
answer

  hm said theophilus dawson
and how did you come to find him
here 

  he listened to the boys explanation
very quietly and when he was beat-
ing you-poor boy ill have a doctor
look after you -didnt you want to
give in 

  jimmy lannigan laughed as heartily
as his battered lips would allow give
in quit he asked say did you
ever see a moving-picture show 

  bless me no

  the hero in them never quits ex-
plained the boy never

  oh he doesnt cried the great
enemy of the films thoughtfully so
you learned that from the pictures
he wralked slowly up and down the of-
fice his face working strangely pres-
ently he paused and laid a friendly hand
on the boys arm next week jimmy
after you get looking like a human being
again you are coming back here he
said kindly your salary will be dou-
bled and some afternoon you are
going-

  he swallowed hard yes asked
the boy breathlessly

  you are going to take me to the
moving pictures said theophilus daw-
son grimly

by theodore goodridge roberts
author of in dog seal bay the missionary etc

     aside from a m chisholm we know of few authors who can tell a
 story of the northern woods with more charm than theodore goodridge
 roberts in the master of the moose horn he has a novel that will
 enthrall you it has the quality of interest that holds the attention at its
  highest pitch a tale of loggers and trappers of red men and white of
 love and hate of disaster and triumph

in two paris-part one

chapter i

in which snow falls on gramercy
park and on the moose horn
country

snow was falling in new york
city floating and twirling down
silently in large soft flakes as fiat
as feathers the high iron fence
of gramercy park was already pointed
and outlined in white trees and shrubs
and garden benches were spotlessly
hooded and cloaked the dauntless
sparrows were gone to roost in the mar-
tin houses windows of homes the
high windows of painters studios and
the wide entrances of clubs glowed
warmly through the falling veils of
the snow the still air was mild and
yet it was pleasant to be able to con-
template one of those glowing porticos
with the knowledge of the right to enter
unchallenged

  snow was falling in the tobique
country in the northern woods-fall-
ing swiftly relentlessly in small crisp
flakes the new ice on moose horn
branch was already covered by a white
quilt seven inches thick the sky was

 black for all its spinning of white no
 wind moved the falling and striking
 of those millions of frost feathers whis-
 pered upon the silence now and again
 some incumbered spruce or fir let slip a
 weight of snow from a bowed limb with
 a sound as light and vague and hollow
 as the drumming of a cock partridge
 the darkness was like midnight but the
 evening was young

   from a square window in a log wall
 - a smudge of yellow light struck feebly
 into the twirling veils of the snow
 within the cabin john hollis lay in his
 bunk silent motionless ashen gray of
 face the doctor had come up to him
 for a few hours three days before all
 the way from plaster bluff and for
 three days and nights his daughter had
 nursed him with unfaltering vigilance
 and tenderness but the fight was fin-
 ished he was unconscious now and
 had been so for hours

    marjorie the daughter crouched on
 the floor in front of the hearth grief-
 stricken and sick with want of sleep
 she too had given up the fight a
 long gasping sigh aroused her from her
 stupor of misery and fatigue she
 sprang to her feet and darted to the


the popular magazine

bunk her fathers eyes were open
now-and blank as the windows of an
empty house the bitter spirit of the
man haj passed

   marjorie sank to her knees beside the
bunk and gave herself to tears she
made no effort toward self-control she
had battled so long against grief-and
weariness and fear-and now fortitude
and vigilance counted for nothing tor-
tured nerves and muscles relaxed be-
neath the weight of her despair even
her dauntless spirit fainted now from
tears she passed unconsciously into a
deep sleep of utter weariness and
misery

   the fire of dry maple fell to glowing
coals on its bed of gray ashes the
cheap clock on the chimneypiece ticked
the drifting seconds away heedless and
unfaltering the dead man stiffened
beneath his blankets and still he stared
up at the brown roof of poles with
wide blank eyes the snow climbed
against the little panes of the window
a wood mouse appeared fan across the
floor and vanished the battered lan-
tern on the tabic beneath the window
continued to burn steadily and to throw
its blunted rays against the spinning
white curtains outside

  something soft struck against the
door and fumbled blindly there for a
moment

  in the wilderness one learns to
waken swiftly from any sleep save that
of death marjorie hollis turned her
face toward the door on the instant of
the lifting of the wooden latch ter-
ror took her pinching her at heart and
throat and striking her face as white as
paper who visited this isolated house
of death at this hour of this night of
blinding storm

  the door opened slowly a squat
muffled figure entered crusted with
snow and closed the door with a dull
thud

   peter is it you cried the girl

  yes replied the visitor removing

his fur cap and beating it against his
body and legs until the dry snow flew
in clouds come darn long ways-
from ben stickneys place mighty bad
night for travelin how yer pa feel
to-night 

  he-is dead whispered marjorie
in a stifled voice

  peter paul crossed the room noise-
lessly and gazed down at the dead man
in the bunk his own face was as ex-
pressionless as the face of the dead

  that right he said calmly john
hollis he dont trap no more fur on
moose horn too bad too darn
bad what you do now hey 

  marjorie shook her head in answer
and covered her face with her hands
the elderly malisefct stooped swiftly
and closed the dead mans eyes then
he patted the girls twitching shoulders

  come long ways for you to-night
he said you come back with me now
little tom stickney he mighty sick an
need medicine darn bad

  she turned a stricken face up to him
but beauty and youth shone there like
pale ghosts in spite of tear stains and
the finger marks of grief and fatigue

  is tommy ill what is it she
asked

  almighty sick all choke up re-
plied the maliseet

  but how can i go-to-night 

  you come with me an bring medi-
cine yer pa dont care he dont need
you any more but little tom stickney
he need you darn bad 

  marjorie packed her very consider-
able collection of medicines in a leather
knapsack then retired to the inner
room of the shack and dressed for the
ten-mile tramp up the moose horn to
stickneys cabin her brain felt like
feathers her eyes and limbs like lead
and her heart was numb but she saw
the way of her duty and accepted it
she was far too tired to think

  upon returning to the main room
she found the fire burning and peter
master of the moose hon



paul awaiting her with a pot of steam-
ing tea she drank thirstily emptying
the big cup twice peter finished the
pot then asked if john had left any to-
bacco around handy she pointed to a
battered tin box on the chimneyshelf
the maiiseet opened the box and
helped himself to three cakes of to-
bacco from one he shaved a few
slices and filled his pipe

  john dont need it any more he re-
marked he dont mind old peter to
take it john wasnt never stingy with
his tobac anyhow

  they covered the fire with ashes ex-
tinguished the lantern and left the
cabin and its dead they fastened the
door on the outside with chain and
padlock snow was still falling they
bound their snowshoes to their mocca-
sined feet then peter led the way
down the bank and up the rivers level
floor through a blanketing darkness
that was flecked blindingly with white
close against the eyes

  marjorie followed close in the old
maliseets tracks the dear familiar
scent of her fathers tobacco drifted
back to her they walked in silence
the only sound in the world was the
vast faint encompassing whisper of the
multitudinous flakes of snow alighting
upon the wilderness gradually the
young womans brain and blood awoke
to the cold stinging of the snow on her
face and the keen air in her lungs

  they reached ben stickneys cabin
after three and a half hours of steady
tramping stickney sprang forward at
the opening of the door and dragged
the girl inside

 thank god he exclaimed i
knew yed come

  he brushed the snow from her with
his bare hands removed her short
blanket coat knelt and loosed the snow-
shoes from her feet

  marjorie darn tired said peter
me too get some rum get some
tea

  marjorie swayed dizzily with fatigue
ben stickney supported her with eager
arms but she freed herself swiftly and
gently and swayed into the embrace of
old peter paul

  that a right said the maiiseet
now you fetch some rum darn
quick

  marjorie swallowed a sip or two of
brandy and recovered herself in a mo-
ment she threw aside her fur gloves
and cap and went to the sick child who
lay flushed and moaning in his boxlike
crib he was in a high fever and de-
lirious his breath wheezed in his ten-
der laboring chest his small face was
flushed his bright lips and little bal-
sam-stained hands were hot and dry

  marjorie asked a few brief questions
of the father then set to work she
administered a dose of some sort of
quinine preparation then rubbed throat
and breast with hot camphorated oil
she set stickney and peter to the task
of cutting out and sewing a little jacket
of old soft blanket when the jacket
was finished she warmed it at the fire
and placed it on the child he opened
his eyes and closed them they were
wonderfully blue and attractive eyes
but now they were unnaturally bright
on the surface strangely dull in their
depths

  marjorie had worked steadily for an
hour since her arrival for a few min-
utes she continued to stand beside the
little cot watching and listening it
seemed to her that the childs moans
were less frequent now and that his
breathing was becoming easier she
knelt then sank lower with her fore-
head against the rough-hewn side of the
cot the sleep of utter exhaustion
flooded over her like a warm black
tide

  ben stickney lifted marjorie ten-
derly and laid her in his own bunk
peter turned the coarse pillow beneath
her unconscious head and spread a
blanket lightly over her then both

men turned again to the boys cot they
stooped over it listening bens tanned
face was lined sharply and his gray
eyes were dull with fear and anxiety

  will he make it he whispered
will he pull through i-i aint got
the courage to lose him i guess id
go clean off my head if he was to die
guess he make it a right replied
peter marjorie one darn good doc-
tor he get his breath easier now what
you think yes

  they sat down on rough stools still
with their unwinking eyes on the boys
cot

  hows john hollis gettin on
asked stickney

  dead said peter die to-night
little while before me an the girl start
for here he was dead when i git to
the shack-an she mighty nigh dead
too so darn sorry an tired

  lord murmured the other softly
an yet she come right along

  marjorie awoke an hour later and
again worked over the sick child the
applications of warm oil in time began
to relieve the laboring chest and the
medicine cooled the fever a little the
old maliseet closed his round eyes and
slumbered with his back against the
wall ben nodded and slept by snatches
where he sat on a three-legged stool of
his own construction but marjorie did
not relinquish her vigil again until five
oclock in the morning then she slept
beside the cot

  the little boy ceased to moan and
toss from delirium he drifted into
slumber the father slept too
crouched on the stool with his elbows
on his knees and his face between his
hands sleep held them all peter
grunted dreaming of a long journey
through new-fallen snow the fire
failed and fell in the deep nitch of the
chimney the tallow candle on the
table burned to an end and expired
smokily the black square of the east-

ern window changed to blue lightened
from blue to gray warmed from gray
to red the sun was over the frozen
edge of the world striking his first hot
glances through the black stems of the
forest

  little tom stickney sighed and
opened his eyes some of the surface
brightness had gone from them and
their depths were clear and calm he
saw marjories hands on the edge of
his cot something of her white brow
and the coils of dark soft hair for a
little while he continued to gaze at these
things in silent wonder and delight at
last he raised a hand and touched the
girls fingers they stirred at the touch
turned slowly and closed upon the lit-
tle hand she lifted her face and
opened her eyes

 oh tommy do you know me
now she whispered

  always know you whispered the
child

  in new york city the snow ceased
to fall at midnight by that time it lay
deep and white over all the thousands
of acres of roofs and hundreds of
miles of hard pavements an army of
midnight workers arose and commenced
the gigantic task of clearing roofs and
streets

  mr william morgan bayford en-
tered gramercy park from the west
just as the snow ceased to fall and the
clocks struck twelve he walked for
he had been forced to abandon his taxi
half a dozen blocks away the snow
had set thousands of others afoot that
night but bayford did not grumble at
having to walk in the snow he
scarcely noticed the cold clinging stuff
through which he waded his mind
was engaged in contemplation of a far
more serious inconvenience than this
to call the subject that occupied his
thoughts to the exclusion of cold feet
an inconvenience is to put it mildly to
tell the truth he was in a tighter fix
master of the moose horn



a more deplorable situation than he
had ever before experienced in all the
twenty-seven years of his merry and
amiable life

  he turned before two big lights in
wrought-iron baskets and stepped down
into the glowing entrance of his fa-
vorite club to one boy he gave up hat
overcoat and stick while two others
brushed the snow from his legs he
sighed as he pocketed his coat check and
nodded to a friend who greeted him
from the top of the short flight of
steps but he did not go up instead
he went down another short flight and
around to the bar a hot scotch made
him feel warmer but not happier he
went upstairs looking for solitude it
seemed to him that he had never be-
fore seen the club so full of happy and
prosperous men not an actor of them
all nor a poet nor a novelist nor an
artist nor a war correspondent nor
even a patron of any art looked as if he
had ever known care he found soli-
tude at last in a little dim-lit reading
room he sat down at a table in a win-
dow and clasped his head between his
hands so he sat for a long time mo-
tionless trying to think

  bayford was disturbed by a light
footfall beside his chair and a light
hand on his shoulder he dropped his
hands raised his head sharply and for
several seconds stared stupidly into the
pink-and-white face of mr charles
wayland

  the devil exclaimed wayland
are you ill

  boyford laughed and pulled himself
together

  i must have been asleep he said
i was nodding anyway

  you look hipped my son have
you been losing sleep lately

  if sleep were all

  youve been at it again

  yes-for the last time

  ive heard that before bill you

idiot if you knew just ten times as
much about the game as you do youd
know enough to leave it alone

robe some pictures some books some

  ill take you home bill youll
soon wake up

  come by all means ill give you
a chance to buy some of your own pic-
tures at your prices of four years ago
bayford lived just across the little
park from the club within ten min-
utes of reaching home he had convinced
his friend of the amazing and discon-
certing fact that his last hundred thou-
sand dollars even his last hundred
cents had passed from his possession
though convinced of the fact way-
land could not grasp the idea

  in six years he murmured it
couldnt be done i thought you were
made of it

  what am i to do asked bayford
suggest something ill sell all this
stuff of course but what then

  i thought you were made of it
murmured the painter feebly

  you need something to clear your
wits said bayford can you reach
that bell without getting up thanks
each consumed a scotch and soda
and a long cigar without arriving at a
solution of the problem of bayfords
future

painter but a man who rids himself
of two millions in six years without a

chapter ii

in which marjorie hollis is visited
by an unpleasant stranger

  ben stickney farmed in the summer
and trapped fur in the winter he had
lost his wife three years ago and im-
mediately after her death he had tried
another way of life for a few months
he had gone out to plaster blufif with
the year-old baby but with the first
thaw of march he had returned to the
log house on the moose horn with his
son and many tins and bottles of in-
fants food on the sled at his heels
since then he had devoted himself to
his new-land fields the trapping and his
child

  marjorie hollis and old peter paul
remained at stickneys place for two
days until tommy was out of danger
then they went downriver peter dug
a hole in the snow dug a grave in the
frozen earth and buried john hollis

  john sleep good now he said and
went away to his hut on snowshoe
brook leaving the girl alone with her
grief

  marjorie did not sleep that night
she sat beside the hearth through the
crawling empty hours and fed the fire
her father had been the dearest thing
in life to her during the five long years
that she had lived in the woods she
had not been blind to his weaknesses
but he had been her friend her com-
rade her protector she had never
loved her mother but she had always
loved her whimsical gentle ruined fa-
ther she had chosen between the two
and had never regretted her choice
and now he- was dead now she was
alone on the moose horn with no
other home in all the world and no
friends except peter paul and ben
stickney and little tom she nursed
her grief that night holding it close to
her heart the better to know it but
she was not afraid she did not fear
the empty bunk the shadows beyond
master of the moose horn



the play of the firelight or the finger-
ing of the frost on the roof

  peter paul proved a friend in need
he went the round of her trap line for
her and helped her skin the few mink
and foxes taken and stretch the pelts
and he gave her advice he advised
her to remain in the woods for the
balance of the winter at least she had
a snug cabin traps provisions enough
to last until spring and six hundred
dollars in cash which her father had
left her peter promised to help her in
her work and to look after her as if
she were his own daughter she
thought the old mans advice good she
felt no desire to go back to the world

  marjorie had been out since sunrise
in the empty frost-stilled forest and
the east was as gray as ashes and the
west as red as a fallen fire when she
got back to her cabin she lit the lan-
tern and was frying bacon for her sup-
per when a sound at the door caused
her to straighten her back and turn
sharply the door opened slowly with
a thin outcry of frosty hinges a
bulky misshapen figure appeared on
the threshold-a tall stooped shape
that seemed to sway and totter as it
peered into the room the girls heart
leaped and chilled in her side she
could not move the swaying thing
tottered forward and fell flat a big
pack done up in a waterproof blanket
rolled over on the iloor

  the girls blood raced warm again
she had seen such packs before her
visitor was human after all-a lumber-
camp peddler he was not a large
man his pack carried high on his
shoulders had given him height and
that terrible bulkiness she turned him
over and looked into a thin bewhis-
kered swarthy face she got brandy
and poured some of it between his gray
lips he opened his eyes-eyes as
black and cold as new ice on a deep
river

  lost he whispered three days
more brandy

  she gave him more brandy then a
mug of hot tea she made him a bowl
or oatmeal gruel which he drank
greedily he sat up and looked about
him his glance dwelt curiously on
the long shelf of books against the far-
ther wall and on the silver cigarette
box and candlesticks on the mantle-
piece he suggested opening his pack
and doing some business but marjorie
would not hear of it

  where is the mister he asked

  he is-out said marjorie

  the peddler smiled slyly

  you live all alone is it he said
i guess so lady

  i live here with my father she re-
torted and now i think you had bet-
ter be moving along before he comes
home follow the trail five miles up
the river and peter paul will house you
for the night

  the peddler chuckled unpleasantly

  what your father doin out so late
he asked

  then marjorie lost her temper she
sprang to the door and opened it she
lifted the peddlers pack and threw it
out he rushed after his pack scream-
ing strange oaths and she slammed the
door and bolted it she hastily fastened
down the sashes of the little windows
and covered them with blankets

  he pounded on the door until mar-
jorie threatened to open it and shoot
him at that he ceased his kicking and
thumping again she cried to him to
go five miles upriver to peter pauls
she received no answer she filled the
magazine of her rifle her indigna-
tion continued to simmer for an hour
and then a chill of apprehension took
possession of her she began to fear
that rat of a man she thought of his
sly black heartless eyes and the fear
grew she did not retire to her bunk
until dawn

  it was late when marjorie awoke
the popular magazine

and the incident of the peddler was the
first thing that flashed into her mind
she felt angry and uneasy the wil-
derness which she trusted and loved
had produced a thing at once repulsive
and menacing she remained in and
near the cabin all day looking out anx-
iously for peter paul but peter did
not come

  the next night passed uneventfully
but the morning did not bring the old
maliseet or entirely restore her cour-
age toward noon she saw ben stick-
ney top the bank and approach across
the clearing she felt a glow of relief
here was a friend and a man whom
she understood she was about to tell
him of the visit of the peddler when
she suddenly thought of his child she
asked if he had left peter at home with
tommy

  nope peter aint at my place he
answered

  then who is who is taking care
of tommy she asked

  the woodsman hesitated for a mo-
ment he shuffled his feet uneasily and
his glance wandered

 he wont come to no harm he
said hes gettin along fine an will
be up an out agin in a few days ive
come to see how yere makin it

  do you mean to say that you have
left the baby alone-alone in that cabin
ten miles from anywhere she asked

  stickneys tanned face flushed darkly

 maybe i do anyhow i reckon i
know how to look after my own
youngster he said

 you dont or you wouldnt be
here  she retorted angrily have you
no imagination no heart he may be
crying for you now and in need of
you-and here you are ten miles away
from him three hours away from
him

  hes all right i tell ye answered
the man sullenly but that aint what
 come here for this livin alone in
the woods aint a decent life for a girl

like yerself ye must be terrible lone-
some will ye marry me marjorie
her eyes flamed and the lines of her
young face hardened

  please dont worry about my lone-
liness she said her voice low and cut-
ting like a lash think about your
baby he is lonely he needs you-
and i dont he wants you-and i
dont go home to him

  you aint got no call to talk to me
like that he cried savagely then he
turned and strode away

  marjorie stood for a full minute mo-
tionless staring unblinkingly into the
fire

  the dull fool she exclaimed sud-
denly he does not deserve to own
the child and i suppose he thinks that
he loves me-that love for me made
him forget and neglect his duty to the
baby love the dull beast and
et he believes himself to be a man-
like my father

  she sank upon her knees hid her
face in her hands and sobbed rend-
ingly what particular emotion or
what combination of emotions inspired
her tears im at a loss to say

  peter paul arrived at marjories
cabin some time about mid-afternoon
but he looked a changed peter his
legs wabbled from ankle to hip his eye-
lids were red and puffy and his eyes
were dull

  peter what is it she cried in dis-
may poor peter have you been ill 
thats a right said the old mali-
seet wearily come to see you
couldnt come yestiday too much
rum lemme lay down

  you have been drinking again
peter and i thought you had grown
too old and wise for that she said ac-
cusingly

  the maliseet lowered himself to the
floor and leaned his back against the
wall he sighed heavily

  never too old to be one darn fool
he said
master of the moose horn



  where did you get the rum or
whatever it was

  gin square-face peddler sell im
to me he stop at my place two three
days forgit how long he sell me
plenty rum an two tin watches no
good start im off this mornin for
sampsons camp on red brook

  he was here said marjorie he
is a detestable person

  peter nodded heavily his eyes
closed slowly

  and ben stickney was here to-
day continued the girl

  peters eyes opened swiftly

  what he come for he asked

  to do me the honor of asking me
to become his wife she replied scorn-
fully

  that no good for you you dont
want to go marry ben stickney

  i am beginning to hate and fear the
woods and this cabin and the moose
horn-since the peddler and ben stick-
ney visited me stickney had no right
to come here and speak to me as he
did he would not have ventured to
do it if father had been here i think
i shall go away after all

  peter had nodded again but at that
his round eyes snapped open and he
sat bolt upright

  go way he cried where you
go to you got no place to go to

  i can go anywhere in the world
she replied why not why should
i remain on the moose horn now that
it has been spoiled for me by that ped-
dler and ben stickney i have six
hundred dollars and some good pelts
and i can find work of some sort in a
city

 you stay right here on moose
horn exclaimed peter you safe
here with me for to take care of you
you got one darn good friend on this
river anyhow-me peter paul you
go to a city you git that six hundred
dollar thiefed from you in ten min-
utes john he never want you to go

work in no city what you work at
anyhow

  but im afraid of that peddler said
the girl i know he will try to do me
an injury and i dont want to see
ben stickney again i shall start for
plaster bluff in a few days and from
there out into the world

  peter grunted and fell asleep the
fumes of his recent potations enthralled
him he slept on marjories floor all
night for she had not the hardness of
heart to waken him and send him away

  by morning peter was steady
enough in the legs but very dull of
spirit he would not eat any break-
fast but drank a couple of mugs of tea
then he volunteered to go out and at-
tend to marjories traps she refused
the offer kindly but firmly she told
him that with the poison of the gin
still in his blood he was not fit for a
hard days work

  but if you can spare the time you
will oblige me greatly by keeping house
for me while i go the round of my
traps she said

  a right he answered in a muffled
and injured voice you think you
darn sight better trapper nor me a
right peter paul stop at home an
play old squaw an keep the kittle
bilin

  left to himself peter nosed about
the cabin prying into everything with
the innocent curiosity of a child he
withdrew and opened several books
from the long shelf discovered a box
of very dry cigars and promptly lit
one of them examined all the pelts
on the walls and the floor and at last
happened upon some loose poles in the
flooring he lifted the poles and dis-
covered a black dispatch box it was
locked and he had no key but he shook
it about close to his ear heard the
crinkle of paper and the clink of heavy
coins and decided that it contained the
six hundred dollars

  wish the devil would bewitch it


the popular magazine

clean away he mumbled then she
wouldnt go way from moose horn
to them darn cities

  he replaced the box in its earthy
bed replaced the poles above it and
the caribou skin above the poles then
he lay down near the fire and slept
the poison of the gin was still in his
blood he slept soundly and did not
awake until marjories return late in
the afternoon he felt much better by
that time helped the girl stretch a
couple of new fox skins ate a bite of
supper with her and then departed for
his cabin on snowshoe brook

  marjorie barred her door and cur-
tained her windows for an hour she
sat before the fire planning her deser-
tion of the woods and trying to guess
the future she felt at once excited
and sad at the prospect of returning to
the great world she planned the short
journey to plaster bluff and counted
her marketable pelts mr sam mc-
nair the storekeeper at the mill
would give her a fair price for her
skins then she decided to count her
money again and crossed the room to
get it she kicked the caribou skin
aside and lifted the loose flooring the
box was not there

  for a few seconds marjorie stared
at the empty hole in the earth with
blank eyes and a blank mind she re-
covered quickly she felt anger rather
than dismay it was a serious loss of
course but no loss of dollars could
daunt her now it did not spell star-
vation or any other desperate thing but
it meant that she would not be able to
leave the moose horn country before
spring that was her first thought
and her second thought was that old
peter paul had taken the box anger
toward peter glowed in her like a hot
coal it was well for him that he had
gone away immediaely after supper
but not for a moment did she accuse
him of being a thief no he was sim-
ply a silly old busybody-and that was

bad enough he had not taken the
money for himself and he would surely
return it to her some day he had sim-
ply taken it so as to keep her on the
moose horn

  without waiting to replace the poles
of the floor marjorie pulled on her
overstockings and moccasins her
blanket coat and mittens and set out
for snowshoe brook with the intention
hot in her to tell old peter what she
thought of his methods of persuasion
and to recover her money immediately
she would let him know that she was
her own mistress all fear of the ped-
dler had gone from her she did not
give him a thought the excitement
of her anger against poor peter had
driven every other trouble and doubt
from her mind for the time the
night was bitterly cold and the stars
were bright the track between her
cabin and the mouth of snowshoe
brook was well beaten and she made
good time on it she reached pe ji s
lowly door and straightway fell to ham-
mering upon it with her mittened fists

  who there what you want in-
quired the voice of the old maliseet
from the other side of the door

  it is i-marjorie hollis replied
the girl

  the door was opened on the instant
she stepped inside quickly purpose-
fully peter closed the door and lit
his smoky lantern he was quite pre-
sentable for it was his custom to sleep
in most of his clothes he lifted the
lantern high and scanned her face with
round anxious eyes

  what the trouble he asked
house afire

  you cant fool me peter she re-
torted sharply though i admit that
you are a clever actor ive come to
tell you what i think of you

  he sighed and set the lantern on a
bench against the wall

  why dont you tell me to-day 
gimme hell now i suppose for gittin
master of the moose horn



drunk that aint good sense you
have plenty chance this mornin
dont waste your time trying to pull
the wool over my eyes i am here for
my money-and to tell you that you
have no right to interfere with my plans
-even if you are my friend give me
my money

  peter raised the lantern again and
again scrutinized her flushed face she
returned him glance for glance but his
dark eyes did not waver he set the
lantern down again

  you talkin bout yer six hundred
dollar he asked

 yes what have you done with
it

  i dont do nothin with im you
keep im in one black box hey

  yes but if you are so ignorant
about it how do you know that i keep
it in a blak box

  that a right look round cabin
today an see that box under the floor
look at im an put im back dont
take nothin-nothin but one cigar
tell you the truth marjorie you
think i rob you 

  i think that you have hidden the
money so that i cant go away

  i think of that too but dont do
it put im back then go to sleep
maybe dig im up agin in my sleep an
hide im dunno

  are you telling me the truth
peter

  yes never tell no lies to you you
better believe me or maybe you git me
darn mad

  i am sorry peter but if you didnt
take it who did it isnt there now-
and you were in the cabin all day
maybe i hide im in my sleep

  are you serious 

  you bet peter paul dont make
no joke on six hundred dollar

  late as it was the two returned to
marjories cabin they hunted high
and low indoors and out for the black
dispatch box but they didnt find it

cja

  perhaps some one came in and took
it while you were asleep  suggested
the girl

  maybe agreed peter

  that peddler perhaps he did not
go over to red brook at all

  maybe we hunt his track to-mor-
row anyhow

in which bayford undertakes to
hide his diminished head in
the woods

  mr william morgan bayford re-
mained in new york after the night of
the prodigious fall of snow only long
enough to receive written particulars
from his late aunts lawyers and to sell
his furniture books and pictures he
felt thoroughly ashamed of himself
shame dominated all other emotions in
his breast after the first bewildering
and unnerving shock of his change of
fortune had passed pie swore charlie
wayland to secrecy he called upon a
certain young woman who had engaged
much of his attentions during the past
six months told her that he was a fool
and proved it to her satisfaction and
accepted his dismissal with a very good
grace he was even thoughtful enough
to express his satisfaction at hearing
that she had never really loved him for
if she had the situation would really
have been rather painful

  bayfords lawyer and his friend
wayland sold his furniture books and
pictures for him and while this was
going on he lay doggo in waylands
rooms in spite of his precautions the
papers had scented enough of his story
for elaboration into half a page of
their sunday editions he was the
man who had gambled away two mil-
lions of dollars in six years and yet
had never played the game with force
or intelligence enough to create so much
as a momentary ripple on the surface
of the financial river he was the

of the arts and sciences-and who was
unable to earn his own living

  one possessor of the pen of a ready
writer reversed the actual figures of
his disgrace and stated that he had
squandered six millions of dollars in
two years another suggested that he
become an art critic he read the pa-
pers and wondered how and when he
had made so many enemies to his
knowledge he had never wished or
done any harm to any one in the wide
world he became a trifle bitter-but
none the less ashamed of himself for
that so he lay low in way lands
rooms ashamed to enter his clubs
ashamed to appear on the streets
ashamed to attend to the selling of his
own treasures in his own house he
was the fool who could spend money
but who could not earn bread

  wayland did very well with the sale
but by the time bayford had settled
a score of little accounts about town
he had only twenty-six hundred dollars
left

  bayford started for the north and
the moose horn country immediately
after the sale feeling that twenty-six
hundred dollars would last him longer
in the woods than anywhere else also
he felt some curiosity concerning his
six thousand acres of wilderness

  at plaster bluff he outfitted and ob-
tained guides his guides were archie
douglas an old woodsman and joe
creamer a young one they dragged
the outfit on two toboggans the first
ten miles of their way led along a
beaten road over which many loads of
provisions had been hauled to a big
lumber camp owned by one nixon at
the end of the ten miles this road swung
sharply to the right and bayford and
his party had to take to the river

  bayford was sound and in fair con-

dition but he had never done much
snowshoeing he soon began to feel
a weariness in muscles that had never
before been weary his snowshoes
felt heavy then heavier and heavier
but he set his jaws and continued to
plod onward along the level white sur-
face of the river he kept it up for
three hours then fell without a word
or a groan the muscles of his legs
were cramped so that he could not rise
the woodsmen lifted him to one of the
toboggans and dragged him ashore joe
creamer made camp and archie rubbed
bayfords legs with warm bears grease

  you got sand mister he said
youll be able to step out as looise as
ashes to-morrow

 they breakfasted at dawn and
reached the mouth of the moose horn
long before noon the distance from
the mouth to bayfords lower line was
sixteen or seventeen miles by river but
archie said that three miles or more
could be cut off by taking to the woods
so they took to the woods with the
old man in the lead a keen wind was
blowing and the dry snow was drift-
ing in clouds but in the shelter of the
woods they escaped much of the sting-
ing drift but the going was heavier
than on the river and their progress
was slow after covering about five
miles exhaustion halted them in a
place of upright and wind-felled tim-
ber some fierce gale of long ago had
uprooted great pines and cast them
crisscross upon the forest floor

  this is about the worst mess of
windfall i ever see said archie
reckon id best take a cruise around
an find a way out

  he returned to the others in half an
hour

  i found two things he said calmly
a way out an a dead man

  a dead man cried bayford
  dead as bill lundys sow

  give im a name said joe creamer
  it aint nobody that matters abe
master of the moose horn



liveen the peddler there aint no
marks on him got lost an froze to
death i callate hed dropped his
pack about two hundered yards from
where he laid aint nothin much gone
from the pack but what he sold to the
boys at the mill-but he had a bunch of
money in his pocket countin way up
round six hundered dollars

  lets have a look at the money said
creamer

  archie produced it-a wad of green-
backs and some gold tied up in a cor-
ner of a red handkerchief

  hes sure robbed a camp said joe
maybe nixons or maybe simpsons
over on red brook

  nixon an simpson both pay with
checks said archie but i callate
hes robbed some one sure enough
they got their toboggan clear of the
blow-downs then went to take a look
at the dead peddler

  hes froze all-fired stiff remarked
archie in grave and contemplative
tones i never seen a man froze so
darn stiff before

  we must bury the unfortunate fel-
low said bayford shivering

  he aint worth it mister returned
archie it would take us a hull day
for to cut out a real grave for him-
an dull our axes into the bargain he
aint worth it-nor no other thievin
peddler what good would it do him
anyhow well jist hist him up into
the top of that there young birch sos
the foxes wont git him

  that is what they did and it did not
take them long to accomplish it and at
the foot of the young birch tree they
placed the bulky pack of worthless
watches rings watch chains pins and
mouth organs then they returned to
their toboggans and continued their
journey it was some time before bay-
ford could clear his mind of the pic-
ture of the frozen peddler fastened up
in the tree with the rope from his own
discarded pack

  after a couple of hours of hard haul-
ing archie called a halt

  we cant make hollis place before
sundown an not then without strainin
ourselves so we mays well camp right
here he said

  they were all asleep by eight oclock
with the heat and glow of the log fire
beating into their lean-to shelter

chapter iv

in which marjorie recovers her
money but not her peace of
mind

  they had not beenn asleep more than
fifteen minutes when bayford awoke
with a violent start from a dream of
the frozen peddler he sat up sharply
in his blankets with the chill of the
dream creeping on his scalp he saw
a squat human figure standing between
the fire and the front of the tent not
more than seven feet away from him
and black as a bear or a peddler against
the yellow glow

  for a moment his sleep-drugged
brain was unable to distinguish between
sleeping and waking between the dream
and the reality and it seemed to him
that the frozen liveen had actually de-
scended from the tree and followed
stiffly into camp he did not cry out
for his tongue had suddenly gone as
dry in his mouth as a slice of fried
bacon but he clutched archie doug-
las shoulder with one hand and joe
creamers with the other the old
woodsman and the young came up in
their blankets as if he had touched a
spring in each-and at the same mo-
ment the squat figure spoke

  good night it said see yer fire
an come along an warm out the frost
a little almighty cold

  the minds of the three men in the
tent must have been haunted by the
same thought for joe ducked his head
beneath his blankets and old archie
cried out in a rusty and fear-shaken

john hollis

  johns quit smokin cigareets re-
plied peter sleepily johns dead
the four made an early start next
morning with peter leading the way
and broke into the little clearing around
marjories cabin before the sun was a
mans height above the spruce tops
they found the girl at home washing
her few breakfast dishes archie and
joe had seen her before archie clasped
her hand heartily and yet with a subtle
suggestion of tender sympathy

  im danged sorry to hear as yer
father is gone he said

  young joe took her hand awkwardly
and waggled it about for several sec-
onds in silence

  but william morgan bayford had
never set eyes on her before and had
not expected to set eyes on anything
like her in the moose horn country
he pulled his fur cap from his head
with both hands leaving his hair stand-
master of the moose horn

 

ing wildly on end and gazed at her with
unveiled astonishment  why had no
one warned him of the fact that this
was a highly civilized and favored quar-
ter of the globe why hadnt peter
paul given him the tip to shave he
felt that he looked like a fool in the
shapeless garments which mcnair had
sold to him

  the girl met his eyes and blushed at
the sight of his astonishment and con-
fusion she extended her hand and
smiled

  im marjorie hollis she said

  my name is bayford-william bay-
ford he stammered dropping his cap
and several pairs of mittens to the
floor

  he seized her hand and waggled it
about as awkwardly as young joe
creamer had waggled it he tortured
his brains for some suitable and com-
monplace remark

  i didnt expect to meet you here
he said

  then he dropped her hand and re
covered his cap and mittens

  you see her before queried peter
his bright glance fixed on the flushed
face of the new yorker

  ive never had the pleasure of see-
ing miss hollis before answered bay-
ford with a fair show of composure

  you act an talk darn foolish said
the maiiseet

  joe creamer guffawed at that old
archie drew the wad of bills and the
red hankerchief from somewhere deep
down in his breast

  heres the money that there ped-
dler stole offen you he said

  bayford and his party refused mar-
jories invitation to remain to dinner
they continued on their course upriver
for about three miles there peter
paul who had accompanied them
called a halt

  guess you somewheres on yer own
land now bayford he said holding
bayfords map wide-spread between his

mittened hands both sides of river
what he raised his glance from the
map and regarded one shore then the
other there one darn fine place fer
yer cabin he concluded

  they pulled the toboggans to the edge
of the level stream and up the drifted
bank they ascended through the slop-
ing grove of spruces and firs to the top
of the knoll which peter had suggested
as a building site archie and joe were
also of the opinion that it was a good
spot for a shack it was close to the
river yet well above its reach in time
of flood a bubbling spring of sweet
water smoked at the base of the knoll
in a cup of green moss rimmed with the
ice and snow that could not still nor
cover it on the roomy flat top of the
knoll stood enough timber for a dozen
cabins so they pitched the tent and
made a fire they banked the back and
sides of the lean-to high with snow

  peter joined them at the midday meal
and at the afternoons chopping that
followed he gave bayford instruc-
tion in the art of swinging an ax
many a big spruce fell and was de-
nuded of his sweeping branches before
the sun went down behind the west
peter took his departure immediately
after supper with a cordial invitation
to come again

  three days passed before marjorie
saw anything more of peter paul or of
mr bayford and his men she won-
dered what had brought bayford into
the woods at this time of year she
had liked his eyes and his voice-and
even his manners which had improved
after the first few moments of aston-
ishment and confusion she did not
make any further arrangements toward
her departure from the moose horn
but decided to mark time for a week
or so she had hidden her money in
a new place and she had nothing to
fear now from the peddler and she felt
a strong curiosity concerning the per-
sonality and affairs of william morgan


the popular magazine

bayford remembering her father she
ws of the opinion that the young
stranger had not come to the moose
horn in the middle of december by
accident

  peter paul turned up at marjories
cabin on the morning of the fourth day
after the arrival of bayford on the
river

  bin watchin bayford he said
learnt im to chop help him build
his shack what you think about im
anyhow 

  do you mean about the young man
who was here a few days ago with ar-
chie douglas and joe creamer she
asked

  the maliseet permitted himself a
swift faint smile

  you think him one pretty fine fel-
ler hey

  he seemed very bashful and awk-
ward  but i have not thought of him
at all-except to wonder why he came
to the woods at such a time as this is
he a naturalist

  he look mighty simple when you
first see im an act mighty foolish-
but he aint no natural good feller
bayford like im darn fine he come
from new york

  and what is he doing on the moose
horn

  dunno nothin own some land
-six thousand acre plenty timber on
that land you bet he dont know
aothin about timber you goin away
so darn quick now

  i have not decided now that the
poor peddler is dead i am not afraid
that my cabin will be burned every time
i turn my back on it perhaps ill not
go out before spring

  that a right you think maybe
bayford kill somebody

  no why should i think that of
him he does not look like a mur-
derer what put that idea into your
head peter 

  dunno maybe he rob some money

out of a bank or maybe he git married
an run away from his wife like john
done

  marjories cheeks paled and a shadow
of suffering darkened her eyes but she
smiled bravely at the old maliseet

  he looked too young to be mar-
ried-too young to have run away from
his wife at least she replied and
he looked far too honest and fearless
for a fugitive from justice why do
you think such dreadful things of him
peter-and at the same time say that
you think he is a good fellow you
must be careful how you talk about
him

  dont think nothin-jes wonder-
in said peter like im fine he
aint so darn ignorant like stickney
bring im over to see you to-morrow
maybe smart feller talk jes as good
as john used to soons he git started
good he ax me all about you but i
dont tell im much

  asked you about me  what did he
ask about me 

  first thing he ax how the devil
come one darn nice girl like that in
these here woods a-livin in a shack
i tell im you bin livin here on moose
horn five year with yer pa an yer pa
die little while back an that how you

man but one darn poor trapper he
ax me what night john die an i tell
im then he say on that same night
i first see what a darn fool i am and
on that same night mighty late i first

  did he tell you what kind of a fool
he had so suddenly seen himself to
be  asked the girl

  he say darn fool

  please dont talk about me any more
to mr bayford-about me or my af-
fairs it isnt fair to me peter

  that a right said peter
master of the moose horn



  he went home to his denlike hut in
the morning he went the round of his
short line of traps in the afternoon he
called on bayford

  you come long with me an make
visit on marjorie he said

  i didnt come into the woods for
that sort of thing replied bayford

  you run away what maybe you
got a wife back on new york hey

 a wife bless my soul no i
wouldnt be able to support her if i
had

  you aint got no money

  thats about the size of it peter
i had some but i lost it

  peter paul went away grumbling
he went straight to marjories cabin
and found the girl at home her eyes
were bright when he first opened the
door but the brightness slipped out of
them when he crossed the threshold
alone he noticed and understood
the girl wore a lace collar that was
new to him at her round white throat
pity and anger moved hot and cold in
him he knew that she had wanted
bayford to come that she was lonely
for folk of her own kind and the
darned fool had refused to come

  bayford say he cant come an see
you to-day he said he mighty busy
workin on his cabin

chapter v

in which bayford feels loneliness
    like a slow fever and is of-
    fered a tempting price for his
    land

  as soon as the cabin was completed
bayford paid off archie douglas and
joe creamer and dismissed them left
alone he devoted several days to chink-
ing the cracks in his walls with moss
and to struggling with his chimney
which smoked prodigiously stone by
stone he rebuilt the chimney from the
hearth to the pitch of the roof and it
smoked more heartily than before so

he gave it up and sat around and
thought regretfully of his past

  for the first time in his life he was
breast to breast with loneliness it put
an edge to his nerves and a restless-
ness in his brains and feet from the
smoky interior of his new cabin he fled
to the empty forest urged by some hope
or longing as potent yet as vague as a
summons in a dream and from the
frozen forest he returned to the cabin
as if the devil trod upon his heels peter
paul had not come near him since the
departure of archie and joe so after
five days of solitude he set out to find
the old maliseet wondering if he had
offended him in any way

  bayford found peters shack without
much difficulty in spite of tha fact that
it looked more like a snowdrift than a
human habitation but the door was
fastened and no smoke arose from the
squat chimney he found the prints
of snowshoes leading away from the
door and as snow had fallen heavily
only twenty-four hours ago he knew
that the trail was fairly fresh so he
followed the trail into the woods

  within a few hundred yards of the
drifted shack the trail swung sharply
bayford gave no heed to its direction
but followed it intently and at his best
pacedriven along by a sense of utter
loneliness that haunted him like a ghost
or a humiliating memory he longed
to hear again a voice that was not of
the wind of the sliding snow or of the
frost-tortured trees he longed to
smell again the smoke of tobacco that
was not of his own burning he trav-
eled fast and far without overtaking
the old maliseet on the trail suddenly
he parted a screen of underbrush and
stepped into a little clearing he be-
held marjories cabin within twenty
yards of him with smoke going up 
cheerily from the chimney he hesi-
tated for a moment then crossed the
clearing and knocked on the cabin door
it was opened to him by peter


the vpulatr magazine

  that you bayford said the maii-
seet darn good thing you come
marjorie cut her foot las night with
the ax

  is it serious asked bayford peer-
ing into the dim interior over the top
of peters head isnt there something
i can do

  mighty bad cut maybe it git poi-
soned what you pretty good doc-
tor what

  no i dont know anything about
that sort of thing worse luck

  darn pity you dont learn something
au the time you live you got long legs
anyhow you go out to plaster bluff
an send in the doctor jes as darn
quick as you know how

  right you are ill travel for all
im worth

  wait one minute come in you
got to take some grub an extry pair of
snowshoes in case you bust somethin
rig you out in one minute step in
an shut the door

  bayford crossed the threshold bare-
headed and closed the door behind him
the small window and the fire lit the
place dimly he saw the girl in her
bunk covered with blankets to her chin
her eyes were open and her white face
was turned to him her hair lay
against her cheeks in thick braids he
approached the bunk diffidently

  i am sure there is no need of send-
ing you away out to plaster bluff she
said it is not bleeding now-and
peter has bandaged it very nicely
you must have a doctor miss hol-
lis really answered bayford im
ashamed at not being one myself but
i can get one i can be of that much
use im glad to say

  you are very kind it is a long
trip-a long trip to make for a
stranger

  pleease dont mention it and please
dont speak like that for we are neigh-
bors

  you sling these snowshoes on yer
back an put this grub in yer pockets
said peter paul drink this mug of
tea an quit talkin you got thirty-five
mile to go stick to the rivers-dont
try takin no short cuts through the
woods there  now you travel quick
as you darn well know how

  au revoir said the young man

  au revoir returned the young
woman and thank you again-and
again dont get lost

  put on yer cap an git out said
peter

  bayford went straight over the crest
of drifts and down the sliding bank to
the surface of the river down the cen-
ter of that level way the winds had
brushed a clean track of hard-pressed
snow not more than ten or twelve inches
deep as bayford turned into this
wind-swept track he glanced at his
watch and saw that the time lacked two
hours of noon he had been early
afoot but he felt fresh and strong he
broke into a jog trot leaning well for-
ward

  in the first hour he trotted more than
he walked and judged that he had cov-
ered more than five miles during the
second hour he did not trot quite so
much or walk quite so fast but he had
caught his second wind by then and
made as good speed in the third hour
as the second he rested for a few
minutes loosed and retied the thongs
of his snowshoes sipped at a flask of
cold tea laced with brandy which he
found in his pocket and ate a little
bread and cold bacon

  he started forward again at a mod-
erate pace but as soon as the slight
stiffness had been worked out of his
knees and ankles he broke into a trot
when he issued onto the wider floor
of the larger stream he halted and
looked at his watch again it was two
oclock he had done fifteen miles in
four hours and lunched into the bar-
gain feeling that this was good but
master of the moose horn



not quite good enough he continued his
journey at a somewhat forced pace

  twenty miles still to go bayford
jogged along steadily with his eyes half
shut his thoughts which had been
roaming afar now came homing to his
skull they refused to deal with any-
thing but the task at his feet the girl
fifteen miles behind and the doctor
twenty miies in front were vague as
characters in a half-forgotten story

 he counted his steps miles are
made up of steps after all he trotted
for one hundred steps then slowed to
a walk for fifty steps then trotted
again the idea came into his head
that it would be a fine thing to keep up
his jogging trot for two hundred paces
instead of one the going was good
and he did not feel tired-only a trifle
stuffy in the chest and a trifle stiff in
the thighs so he did it-two hundred
paces and ten more for good measure
but when he tried to slow down to a
walk he fell flat on his face he lay
still for a minute feeling very tired all
of a sudden then rolled over got stiffly
to his feet and readjusted the thongs
of his snowshoes

  im making great time he mut-
tered ill keep it up and set a rec-
ord

  he continued his journey with un-
flagging courage walking running
counting his paces and losing the
count staggering to his knees now and
then and now and then falling flat
his falls became more and more fre-
quent and his recoveries slower as time
passed and the white miles were wound
up on his snowshoes that was a pretty
idea of his own-the winding up of
the white miles on his snowshoees no
wonder they were growing heavy-
heavier and heavier with the gathering
in of each mile he emptied the flask

  bayford looked up and beheld a big
heap or brow of new-cut logs on
the nearer bank he sat down in his
tracks rubbed the calves of his legs

with both hands and regarded the logs
drowsily he knew that the logs were
important and that he should bring his
mind to bear upon them but his mind
was in no mood to be disturbed he
managed to arouse it at last however

  nixons camp he said nixons
camp for sure how far into the camp
i wonder must get into camp and
send a fresh man for the doctor

  he staggered to his feet and shaped
his course for the shore he fell half
a dozen times while getting to the top
of the drifted bank beside the brow of
logs he topped the drift at last and
came face to face with a man in a red
woolen cap and a green-and-brown
jumper

  all in he muttered and pitched
into the well-beaten road with a clatter
of fouled snowshoes

  he opened his eyes five minutes later
and saw that he was being carried by
the knees and the shoulders toward a
big camp in a big clearing though his
legs were numb his brain was clear and
alert

  hold on  he yelled

  the man who had him by the knees
turned a bewiskered inquiring face
over a bulky shoulder but neither he
nor the man behind paused in their la-
bored stride

  miss hollis on moose horn has
cut her foot said bayford will you
send a man out to plaster bluflf for the
doctor immediately ill pay him for
the trouble

  doc wilkins is in the camp this very
minute returned the man who held
him beneath the shoulders he come
in last night to set bruce mcdonalds
busted leg

  nixon himself was in camp he was
a big lumberman big industrially as
well as physically he carried on his
operations against the forests in half a
dozen widely separated localities as
soon as he heard bayfords story he
ordered one of his men to accompany


the popular magazine

doctor wilkins upriver another to mix
a hot scotch for bayford and yet an-
other to help bayford into a bunk and
to rub his legs with liniment

  bayford slept soundly after the mug-
ful of hot scotch he did not wake
until morning for muscles and nerves
were drugged with fatigue the big
room was lit by many lanterns when
he opened his eyes and from the double
tiers of bunks along the walls the men
were issuing sluggishly and clothing
themselves for the day these were
the choppers swampers team tenders
and yard tenders the teamsters had
been up and out to feed their horses
more than an hour before and were
now smoking their pipes by the high
stove near the western end of the room
the cook and his assistants were busy
at the wide low stove near the other
end of the shack

  the long table was already laid for
breakfast-set out with mugs and
plates platters of hot biscuits of hot
fried pork of fish cakes dishes of fried
potatoes plates of doughnuts cans of
butter tin-topped pitchers of molasses
slabs of gingerbread plates of white
bread huge pots of tea and coffee bay-
ford had never seen had never even
suspected such a breakfast he
climbed from his borrowed blankets
dressed washed his face and hands in a
tin basin full of hot water supplied by
the cook and then took his seat at the
table with the others

 nixon hunted bayford up after
breakfast gave him a long cigar asked
a few questions about his life on the

moose horn then offered him twelve
thousand dollars for his land on that
river bayford smoked slowly and
thought hard he shook his head

  twenty thousand said the lumber-
man

  bayford looked through the window
at his elbow and considered the sum of
twenty thousand dollars it was a con-
siderable sum of money but what good
would it be to him if he went back to
his old life with it and he thought of
his six thousand acres of forest-and of
peter paul-and of the girl whose need
of a doctor had sent him out yesterday

  im not selling he said

  on his way home he decided that he
had done a wise thing in resisting the
temptation of nixons offer but for
the life of him he could not understand
how he had managed to resist it he
was tired of life on the moose horn-
tired of sitting in his lonely shack and
pondering over his past foolishnesses
he reached the hollis clearing at five in
the evening and learned from peter
that the doctor had arrived safely had
already dressed the cut foot twice and
was of the opinion that it would heal
quickly and cleanly he saw a young
woman with a blanket over her head at
the window of the cabin

  who the mischief have you there 
he asked

  that dolly sacobie daughter to my
daughter replied peter she come
over height of land las night to beg
grub off me so i set her to nursin mar-

the engineers

by alan sullivan

the ways of the lord be manifold he has fashioned divers men

to fret the earth for a little space with labor laughter and tears

to strut in the light till the world forgets and buries them deep-and then
the lord he stiffened his good right arm and fashioned the engineers

where the naked ribs of the liner curve and the straining rivets whine

where the plunging crosshead spatters the oil in the incandescents glare

where the clanging coal scoop swings in the gloom and the blistering clinkers
      shine

behold him-cool as an icebergs foot-the slave and the master there

when you come to the end of the old known land to the far horizons rim

  to the raw crude plain where the uplands lift and the mountains clamber
     sheer

the small wise men of the ledger halt and the call goes forth for him
who laughs at the everlasting hills-the master the engineer

by lathe and chisel by hammer and forge he is shaping the things that be

he has harnessed the stream to his dynamo he has said to the tides beware

he grubs in the echoing womb of the earth and sits on the floor of the sea

  and rides athwart of the thunderstorm in the hollow caves of air

smooth and silent and very sure he fingers the locking switch

where the yellow copper is glutted with death as it gleams on the marble wall

and he turns on his heel when the red lamps wink to balance his power and pitch
through the gloom of the throbbing canon streets the might of a waterfall

he weighs the world and the eye of a fly and he measures the light of a star
and plays with a key at the end of a wire till the slumbering cities hear

he whispers low and cradles his words on the curve of a waxen jar
  that the bottom end of the earth may list to the voice of the engineer

he has come to grips with eternal truth and he dallies not with lies

he has ravished his mind of its small conceits and he knows not how to shirk

for the thing-the ultimate perfect thing is glimmering in his eyes

and a voice a small reiterant voice is whispering will it work 

when we come in time to the end of the road to the step of the golden gate
  we shall see a fellow in overalls and hell probably stop and peer

to see how the gate is built and then if we only watch and wait

we shall notice him oiling the golden hinge-the beggar-the engineer

by wells hastings
author of lthe dancing dollthe patriots  etc

  the dancing master and his assistant unearth a dastardly plot on
  the high seas and provide a few surprises for two very famous
  gentlemen who exerted a powerful influence on american finance

when at last in the heat of
summer we closed our new
york salle de danse and took
up our classes in the semi-
open pavilion which rene had leased
at newport and christened en plein
air we entered upon a quite different
daily routine in new york we had
treated our patrons as our guests with
the relaxed formality of summer our
patrons now treated us as theirs we
began the season with our customary
decorum but it occurred to some in-
genious spirit to have a morning class
in bathing suits on baileys beach and
one cannot very well execute the lulu
farde in bare feet and be occasionally
upset with ones partner by an unex-
pected seventh wave and retain the stiff
formality which the stricter etiquette
dictates

  even in this circumscribed class peo-
ple began to take on individuality and
somewhat to my surprise i discovered
a few who were likable and fairly ra-
tional being or believing yourself to
be constantly in the eyes of the world
tends to smooth out superficial pecul-
iarities but if a man raised nothing but
peacocks and studied them as closely
as the sluggard is advised to observe
the ant he would probably find that al-
though his flock was largely common-
place there were here and there nota-
bly sweet or notably villainous indi-
viduals

  the two very famous gentlemen who
exert such a powerful influence on
american finance and whom rene
chose to dub the gold bond twins
we met here for the first time there
was nothing angelic about mr archer
-as i shall call him-but he was a
spirit of light compared to his power-
ful rival mr bemis-as i shall call him
both of them as all the world knows
are somewhat past middle age and con-
duct their private affairs with a secrecy
as strict as their public life is elegantly
ostentatious as a barefoot dancer
neither of them was a great success

  we liked herbert archer but it was
julius bemis who made much of us
in all the brilliant affairs at valhalla
the spreading and turreted marble cot-
tage of julius bemis rene shawn and
i were made the focal points of inter-
est the evenings stellar attraction we
were mr bemis guests at the casino
and not infrequently carried out by
his speed launch to a select little dinner
party on his ocean-going yacht the vi-
king we smoked his especially im-
ported havanas and drank his vintage
wines and thoroughly detested the
man the very sight of him jarred
renes sesthetic sensibilities

  in the public prints he may be pass-
able enough frank he said in the
black and white of a flattering artist
he may get by but that great bleached
moon face of his has sickened me once
high seas



and for all with the fancy that the
moon itself is made of green cheese if
vampires walked in real life they
wouldnt look like beautiful sharp-
toothed young women but the spit and
image of julius bemis in a large way
too he is a vampire for he is busy
every moment sucking the lifeblood of
the nation in the smart-aleck ameri-
can phrase he might very truly be said
to be the guy who is taking the trans-
ports out of transportation and putting
the end to dividend and i suppose
if he knew as much about us as he
thinks he does he would be the first one
to call us a menace to society i should
like to tell him to go hang with his little
dinner

  rene straightened the ends of his new
evening tie and began vigorously brush-
ing his flaming hair back from his fore-
head

  i wonder what he is up to frank
we are to be his only guests to-night
you know

  give it up i answered probably
it is only a little private instruction
the bigger and grosser a man seems to
be the more confident he is nowadays
that he can become a rene shawn

  to the devil with you frank  rene
laughed flinging his long opera cloak
about his shoulders hurry man the
launch must be waiting for us already

  rene had not been mistaken julius
bemis was up to something for a man
of his presumable intelligence he made
his proposal childishly

  gentlemen he said once the elab-
orate dinner was over and we were com-
fortably settled to our cigars on the
broad after deck as you must have di-
vined by now i have taken an unusual
liking to you he blew a great cloud
of smoke into the air i do not make
friendships easily and i think that i
may say that my friendship is-well-
worth something i have been trained
in a hard school of experience and have
come to the time of life when i am fond

of occasional relaxation most of us
are inclined to take life too seriously
we can live better and do better work
if we get some fun out of living it is
an idea which i have been vainly try-
ing to impress upon herbert archer
but you know his stiffness the man has
not unbent in so long that he is in
danger of ossification he is so bound
up in affairs that his entire horizon has
come to be bounded by wall street and
the london market i have tried to do
missionary work but nothing i can say
makes any difference to him so at last i
have decided upon a plan which should
give us all some amusement and bring
archer to a view of life for which he is
certain to bless me as long as he lives
i intend to present him with a vaca-
tion

  bemis waved the hand which held
his cigar in a broad and comprehensive
gesture there was a moment of si-
lence as if the great man waited for
his idea to be caught by lesser intelli-
gences frankly i must own that i saw
neither his intention nor how it con-
cerned rene or myself but i noticed
that shawn was stiffening like a high-
bred pointer

  would it be too much to ask said
shawn just exactly what you mean by
presenting him with a vacation and
what part frank colvaine and i are to
take in a presentation i suppose that
we have some part or you wouldnt
have brought us here to talk it over

  you are quite right said bemis
my plan is in the nature of a jest and
i find that i need help you monsieur
shawn and you monsieur colvaine
strike me as unusual men in this stodgy
community the word is peculiar but
if i may say so you are sprightly-
that exactly expresses my feeling about
you you are also resourceful and in
this i need the assistance of resource-
ful friends he bared his teeth in a
hard smile this is a joke at which
the whole world will laugh i am go-


the popular magazine

ing to give herbert archer a three days
cruise on the viking he has never
been out of sight of land on a private
yacht it will broaden his horizon con-
siderably

  shawn tossed his cigar over the rail-
ing and got to his feet you mean
that you are going to give him this
cruise alone  that you are not going
to be aboard yourself he asked

  bemis nodded and rubbed his great
moist hands together

  it is not a jest i care to have any-
thing to do with shawn snapped and
took hp his long cloak

  gome come young man why not
you go off like a spoonful of powder
you know nothing of my plan and yet
you say youll have nothing to do with
it

  do you wish me to speak frankly 
asked shawn

  most assuredly

  then mr bemis to my judgment
which may be hasty you are proposing
nothing more nor less than a gigantic
kidnaping scheme in which colvaine
and i are to be at once cats-paws and
scapegoats i can only guess at the de-
tails of your proposal but i can tell
you now before you have made confi-
dences which you would afterward re-
gret that you have come to the wrong
people i cannot imagine what induced
you to think that either of us would be
party to any such lawless undertaking
we are peaceful law-abiding folk-
you should have heard the ring in
renes voice as he said this-content
to teach what we know of dancing and
to follow the routine of honest toil from
day to day men in your position mr
bemis are too prone to feel that you
can move the rest of us like puppets
any simple thing we could do in friend-
ship we should be glad to offer our-
selves for but above all we respect the
law and its voice is sovereign to all
others

  even the great have their weaknesses

rene shawns was his sense of situation
and humor more than once it has run
him into such great danger that i have
trembled for him and over and over
again i have remonstrated with him but
the vice seems to be incurable when
the thing he is saying happens to strike
him as amusing he will carry it to peril-
ous limits which are only tempered by
his scornful judgment of the intelligence
of his listener it seemed to me now
that these fulsome protestations of vir-
tue must topple over by their sheer mag-
nitude bemis had no reason to think
us anything but what we pretended to
be but knowing what we had been my-
self renes impudent bombast seemed
like a cynical and jocular confession

  oh sit down said bemis you
misunderstood the spirit of this thing

i have no doubt of your honesty and i
am not coming to you because i am
looking for men to put through a shady
operation but because i thought that
you two could relish a joke that i want
to play on a mutual friend let me tell
you all about it then you can decide
whether you want to come inside or
not

  bemis scheme was briefly this he
proposed to give a dinner party to ar-
cher and shawn and me archer was
known to have something of a weak-
ness for vintage wine and more than
once he had spent the night after a ban-
quet as the guest of a discreet host
bemis planned to play upon this foible
of his friend and to keep him on the
yacht overnight he himself then was
to go ashore and shawn was to be put
in authority and to give the captain in-
structions to make for open sea the
key was to be turned in the door of
archers stateroom the supposition be-
ing that shawn supposed him ashore
and when he made so much disturbance
that he could be ignored no longer he
was to be discovered and apologized to
but told that the engines had unfortu-
high seas



nately broken down we were to be
away three days

  it made me uneasy while bemis
talked to see the flicker of those red
fires in shawns amber eyes that i
had come to know portended trouble for
somebody it was unthinkable that he
should lend himself to any such mad-
ness as this but that in the end was
exactly what he did-he accepted not
only for himself but for me there
was something in the back of his mind
but though i questioned him later he re-
fused to enlighten me

  three nights later the bemis launch
took us out again to the viking lying
at anchor in the harbor rene i re-
member hummed a little french song
under his breath all the way out while
i sat glumly in the stem sheets filled
in spite of my confidence in him with
the keenest foreboding if this thing
fell through we wouldnt even have
money enough left to pay a lawyer for
the bulk of our earnings had been de-
posited under other names abroad and
what we had earned since rene had
sent yesterday to our brokers for his
proposed speculation-an act which in
itself would go a long way to help in
our conviction as it drew a straight line
between the crime we contemplated and
our motive for it

  we arrived as had been arranged a
good half hour before the time set for
dinner bemis met us as we came up
the side and i will say for him that he
showed few evidences of-being nerv-
ous he still persisted in his pretense
that the crime he had conceived was
nothing but a practical joke of gigantic
proportions from which its victim
would really derive physical and spir-
itual benefit he was chuckling as he
took us below to show us what arrange-
ments he had made

  this is to be your stateroom mon-
sieur shawn he said and this one
adjoining it is for monsieur colvaine

you see they are opposite my own
as archer is to be guest of honor i
have given him that he should find it
comfortable

  bemis pushed open the door as he
spoke and waved us in before him
nothing is lacking i think he added
as we looked about at its luxurious ap-
pointments nothing not even the
key which i have left as you see on
the outside of the door but it has oc-
curred to me to have the electric call
bells disconnected and we will keep the
crew and stewards away from this part
of the ship as long as possible it might
be managed for a day or even two
days with luck so lest archer suffer
too much-he is too fond of the flesh-
pots but that is no affair of mine-i
have made this little arrangement

  he pushed open a second door and
we all went through into a beautifully
tiled private bathroom on a small
table beneath the heavy porthole light
were three bottles of wine in a rack
a plate of bread-and-butter sandwiches
and another piled with symmetrically
arranged slices of various cold meats

  even archer should be able to live
a couple of days on that said bemis
i would have had more put up but
it would have been too clear evidence
that i had planned to have you sail
away with him intentionally even this
is a little large but aside from that it
is only the lunch which it is the stew-
ards routine duty to place here every
night when i might possibly be aboard
it should easily satisfy a temperate man
for two days among the poorer
classes i have heard the life of a
whole family is maintained for a period
as long as that on a quantity of food
no greater and naturally of a much in-
ferior quality he concluded piously

  once on deck again bemis sent his
steward for the captain and the mate

  captain carlson he said when he
had introduced them to us i am lend-
ing the viking to these two friends of


the pocpullr magazine

mine they intend i believe to take
a three or four days cruise out to open
sea i shall take it as a favor if you
will consider yourselves as much under
mr shawns orders for that time as
if he were the owner i trust that you
and mr andrews will do everything
you can to make things comfortable
both of you know that i like my orders
obeyed unquestioningly and i wish mr
shawns orders or mr colvaines for
that matter to be followed in the same
spirit he narrowed his round eyes
in the queer manner he had when he
wished to particularly impress his hear-
ers if they wish to go hunting ice-
bergs or whale or to make a bonfire
forward of the deck chairs they are to
be obeyed for tlje time of the cruise
the viking is to be theirs absolutely
do you understand me

  without a smile or any other-expres-
sion of emotion carlson who was a
short and stocky norwegian nodded
mr andrews the mate a tall stoop-
shouldered scot forced a reluctant
smile and muttered that he knew his
duty

  very well answered bemis your
next orders will be from mr shawn
i go ashore to-night

  there he continued when cap-
tain and mate had gone back to their
quarters you are all arranged for i
have set my heart upon this gentle-
men and i am not going to run a
chance of failure he took a little
folded square of white paper from his
waistcoat pocket and held it forward
for our inspection in the palm of his
hand i dont think i shall need this
he said but if archer proves unusually
hard-headed i shall start a fit of cough-
ing which is to be a signal to you to
create some sort of diversion thatwill
sufficiently occupy his attention to give
me an opportunity to drop this harm-
less little powder into his glass it
can do him no harm and will only
give him a refreshing sleep but if

i know archer there will be no need
of using it

a boatswains  whistle sounded
shrilly and bemis leaped to his feet
here is archer now he said hur-
riedly everything is clear is it not
quite so said shawn

  shawn and i stared into each others
eyes as bemis hurried to the side

  what do you know about that
shawn whispered there is a dime-
novel villain for you i wouldnt miss
this for a thousand dollars frank
figure to yourself the scene as one of
the richest men in america slips an-
other one a pinch of knock-out you
and i are babes in the wood frank
when we travel in this class

  i hope he knows what hes doing
i whispered uneasily

  you can bet he does here the old
judas comes with his dear friend now
people that live by their wits must
keep their wits clear both rene and
i love to savor life but neither of us
is given to the fleshpots we believe
with the greatest modern essayist that
a good bush needs no wine yet for
mere appearances sake i had to drink
that evening the dinner started with
cocktails and every one of its numer-
ous elaborate courses was attended by
its appropriate wine and the silent
stewards were constantly busy filling the
emptied glasses i drank as sparingly
as possible but long before the dinner
was over i felt my pulses drumming
and gay fires running in my blood

  shawn to all appearances was
simply raised to the level of his best
he was cool and witty and graceful
full of sparkling anecdote and as adept
as usual at the difficult accomplishment
of giving brilliance by a deft word or
so to the commonplace utterances of
others

  bemis drank nervously and greedily
tossing off the precious old wines with
a gulp holding himself with a sort of
hoggish stolidity but i saw that his
high seas



broad white face began to glisten with
sweat as the dinner advanced

  archer a gentleman born and bred
as alt the world knows drank more
than any of us but with a control and
grace which masked the guzzling and
gluttony

  rene and i have a handy code of
which we often make use it is simple
enough being merely an adaptation of
the morse alphabet a spelling in dots
spaces and dashes the index finger
is a dot the middle finger a dash the
third finger a space and for conveni-
ence the little finger means that a let-
ter is completed the thumb that a word
is finished and closing the hand that
the whole signal hasycome to an end
the fingers may be moved silently or
drummed in a seemingly careless fash-
ion toward the end of dinner i saw
renes right hand carelessly playing
with the tablecloth he was in the
midst of an elaborate story but the
message to me was spelled out without
a break 

  go to the captain frank and tell
him to have them get up steam

  i made some excuse and left the
table i was somewhat vague in my
mind as to where the captain of a pri-
vate yacht should be looked for but
eventually i found him smoking a
cigar upon the bridge and he took my
orders readily enough practically re-
peating them down the speaking tube
near at hand the air was delight-
fully cool and fresh after the smoke
and the heavy scents of food and wine
the stars were out and the harbor beau-
tiful with the twinkling lights of all
sorts of craft i lingered a moment to
refresh my lungs and eyes and brain

  when i got back rene was sitting
alone at the littered table and sur-
prised as i was i felt the old thrill
of pride that this man was my friend
all about him was elegance in disor-
der the heavy damask cloth was strewn
with broken nutshells and stained with

ca

the still-creeping red blotch of an over-
turned glass of wine smoldering cigar
butts lay in their ashes in the saucers
of empty coffee cups and crumpled
napkins had been flung to the floor or
marked the empty places before the
empty chairs there is nothing much
more sordid than the wreck of a recent
feast but rene sitting there cool and
immaculate his heavy cigar laid aside
and one of his long russian cigarettes
between his fingers looked as if no
disorder or confusion could touch him

  where are they i asked

  for answer shawn put a key which
i recognized as that of bemis private
stateroom upon the table

  you told them to get up steam
he asked good we shall start as
soon as the launch gets back again

  but-how could it all have happened
so quickly i asked archer seemed
all right or right enough when i left
and i couldnt have been gone ten min-
utes

  ten minutes is a long time jfrank

  then i saw that his coolness was a
little unnatural that it covered an un-
usual excitement to the world in gen-
eral rene is inscrutable enough i im-
agine but i know him too well to be
often deceived i knew now what had
happened

  the powder i asked did he
use the powder

  shawn nodded listen he said
they are hauling the launch aboard
and i must give them their sailing
orders

  my stateroom was perfect in all its
appointments my berth was broad and
as easy as the clouds which religious
artists furnish for their angels repose
its sheets were the finest linen and its
blankets the softest fleece but for all
that i slept uneasily that first night
as we headed east northeast for open
sea

  rene had said he was tired and had
gone to bed as soon as his orders were


the popular magazine

given and we were under way he was
quite cheerful and showed no signs of
anxiety but in spite of my confidence
in him i found it difficult to view the
affair with the same sanguine indiffer-
ence he might have a very plausible
story prepared for the pacifying of his
captive but to my mind it would be
only a little short of impossible to soothe
the righteous anger of a man of ar-
chers undoubted mental attainments
with a lie or an apology bemis mo-
tive would be instantly apparent to him
and our own was to be easily inferred

  hour by hour as we left brentons
reef lightship behind and the sea grew
heavier and the viking began to give
voice to the multitudinous squeakings
and clangors of a steam-driven rolling
ship in heavy weather i expected to
hear the thud of fists against the stout
door across the passageway and the
roaring voice of the distinguished vic-
tim of our treachery no sound came
bemis powder seemed to have done its
work but it was only toward morning
that i dropped asleep

  i was up early but i found shawn
ahead of me when i came on deck the
day was a glorious one with a heavy
breeze astern which was blowing the
waves flat and catching white handfuls
of spray from their crests and chasing
smoke-white streamers of cloud across
the brilliant blue above us the wal-
lowing wrenching roll had disappeared
and the viking seemed to trip along at
her eighteen-knot clip with a swing and
sway not altogether unlike the dances
from which we were playing truant
the cold salt plunge which i had taken
below had much refreshed me i felt
pleasantly reckless glad to be at sea
in any cause good or bad and grow-
ing keen for breakfast

  frank said rene with his amber
eyes sparkling there are certainly
some advantages in being a millionaire
my ambition has been growing dull but
this sqrt of thing gives it a new im-

petus i dont yearn for a marble cot-
tage but you and i must arrange to
have a yacht of our own while we are
still young enough to enjoy it

  i was thinking the same thing
rene i said and indeed with the in-
toxication of air and sun i believed
that rene and i could easily come by
such a trifle my present imagination
was however more immediate how
about breakfast  i asked

  i have arranged to have it sent up
here on deck

  in this breeze  i protested why
the coffee will be blown out of our
cups

  for all that i think we shall try
it renes red head was cocked a lit-
tle to one side and suddenly i realized
that he was listening

  i listened too the wind was sing-
ing through the low rigging but above
its shrill voice i heard another deeper
one muffled to be sure and coming
from some distance below us but with
a roaring energy about it that made its
anger unmistakable

  let us take our breakfast here by
all means i assented as cheerfully as
possible in my abrupt dismay for the
moment i had forgotten archer but
now it was only too clear that the ef-
fects of the sleeping powder had worn
off and that he had found the door of
his stateroom locked on the outside and
realized something of his predicament
a glance through the heavy glass of
his porthole must have been sufficient
to convince him that we were well out
of sight of land

  my appetite for breakfast had dis-
appeared but i managed it somehow
if i were not fond of danger if peril
and uncertainty were not meat and
drink to me i should be more than a
fool to lead the kind of life i do but
although this adventure was danger-
ous enough heaven knows its risks
were not of the sort in which i take
pleasure i like a chance to win my
high seas



way out by quickness of wit or some
physical strength or agility ther is
no getting away from a boat at sea
quick thought or quick action cannot
help much when there is no possibility
of escape and a great private yacht has
the individuality of a person of im-
portance-in a hundred ways its goings
and its comings are watched and
known

  even while we ate i noticed that the
commotion below was attracting atten-
tion the well-trained stewards
paused a moment as the passed each
other their usually blank faces touched
for once with curiosity and concern
members of the crew drew together in
small groups whispering and question-
ing and pausing in the midst of their
questions to listen once more to the
muffled hullabaloo below i saw the
boatswain go off in the direction of the
captains quarters and presently mr-
andrews the mate came and stood
before us

  mr shawn he commenced uneas-
ily i hate to disturb you at your
breakfast but the men are asking ques-
tions and-and i wondered if you had
noticed the racket that is going on be-
low one of the stewards tells me that
it comes from the owners stateroom
that somebody is locked up in there
who claims-

  mr andrews shawn interrupted
will you be kind enough to ask cap-
tain carlson to step here a moment
come back with him please

  the mate turned on his heel and hur-
ried away probably the captain had
been expecting some such call for it
was only a moment before he came back
with mr andrews both of them evi-
dently were uneasy and the captains
glance at shawn held more of suspi-
cion than respect

  captain carlson rene began i
have asked you to come here with mr
andrews because i am sure you must
be very much puzzled by all that is go-

ing on at present and i wish to remind
you that i am under orders and that
for the time being you are directly un-
der mine i should like to acquaint
you with what is going on but i should
be exceeding my instructions if i did
so you may remember that mr bemis
told you that i was to be unquestion-
ingly obeyed and that he even went so
far as to give you some hint that my
instructions might be peculiar that is
all i have to say i merely wished to
remind you for your own comfort of
your owners explicit commands give
the men something to do that will oc-
cupy their attention and forbid any
one to go near mr bemis stateroom
you need not fear any trouble that
is all i think

  but he is shouting that- com-
menced the captain

  shawn silenced him with a gesture
and got to his feet not another
word he said shortly you have
your orders

  when rene shawn drops his air of
graceful refinement and stands his rigid
six feet two with humor and kindli-
ness gone from his face and his wavy
shock of red hair fairly bristling with
a kind of spiritual electricity men do
not stand on the order of their going
like one man carlson and andrews
saluted and went forward the whis-
pering groups on deck broke up and
the viking as she plowed along be-
came the scene of much earnest and
rather meaningless activity

  the clamor died down after a while
but by luncheon time it was renewed
with what seemed to me redoubled
vigor the inarticulate shouting and
the thudding of clenched fists was no
longer heard btit the occasional crash
of some hard object against the panels
of the door below made it ominously
plain that our captive was making a
more intelligent effort at escape we
had been trying to hold a calm conver-
sation on any subject but the one up-


the popular magazine

permost in our minds but at last i
could stand it no longer

  listen rene i said after a par-
ticularly loud crash that sounds as if
he had taken the bed to pieces and was
using one of the bars as a battering-
ram no door can stand that kind of
thing very long he will be up here
presently

  rene laughed i never saw you in
such a funk he said come you
need diversion go to the wireless
house and find out how our little flut-
ter in general atlantic is getting on
the market should be closing in a few
minutes

  the wireless house on board the
viking was much like the customers
room at a prosperous brokers except
of course that it was on a tiny scale
to his duties as operator the marconi
man added that of brokers clerk and
kept a miniature stock board of the
bemis specialties constantly checked up
with the market so that the owner
could tell at a glance the exact trend
of his manipulations atlantic general
the archer specialty headed the list
and one agonized look was enough to
tell me that there had been some dread-
ful mistake bemis was the head and
forefront of the bear movement against
atlantic general and since morning the
stock had risen twenty points our
brokers must have sold us out long
ago

  atlantic general-you are sure you
have the figures right there is no mis-
take i asked the operator

  he shrugged his shoulders the
error of a fraction would cost me my
job on this boat sir

  it was hard to tell rene what i had
discovered his plans go wrong so sel-
dom that he is apt to take his rare re-
verses with no very good grace there
was no breaking it gently

 rene- i began

  out with it frank whats the
trouble 

  nothing much wre have lost our
money but there is more where it
came from i suppose

  what makes you think weve lost
it

 atlantic general has gone up
twenty points

  i did not hear shawns answer it
was drowned in a deafening crash from
below there was a rush of heavy
feet and the whole deck seemed to
ring with the hoarse and strident roar
of profanity i ducked just in time to
avoid a blow from the long steel side-
bar of one of the vikings brass beds
but although the blow missed me i felt
that i had taken leave of my senses
until i heard the astonishment in renes
voice

 mr bemis he cried you
what has happened  how did you get
here

  you rascal shouted bemis i am
omitting his fluently profane qualifica-
tions you-even more brilliantly
qualified-crook ill have you in
states prison for this if i leave enough
of you to put there

 why mr bemis said shawn
sweetly i cannot understand this at
all have you changed your mind
about mr archer have you let him
out

  out you fool he was never in
there i was in there i julius bemis
do you hear and you sir are at the
bottom of it

  shawns mannerchanged he shoved
aside the odd weapon which bemis car-
ried and gripped the magnate suddenly
by both shoulders holding him away
from him and looking down into his
face as he spoke

  we will have no more of this if
the criminal dirty work which you
planned for me has gone wrong you
have only yourself and your strong
wines to blame his voice rose
when you planned to kidnap archer
high seas



-he paused and looked over his shoul-
der both bemis and i followed his
glance the captain and the mate were
coming toward us on a run when

you planned- shawn commenced

again

  bemis did not get to his position in
the world without certain unusual men-
tal magnitudes in spite of his tower-
ing rage and his inner certainty that
he had been victimized he took in the
situation and its possibilities and ac-
cepted defeat before the captain
reached us

  very well he muttered look
out for yourself for the rest of my
life young man good afternoon cap-
tain carlson no nothing is the mat-
ter mi shawn and i have been de-
ciding a little bet he had an idea that
i could be locked up in my own boat
but i think that i have convinced him
of his error a fine brisk day to be
at sea is it not 

  the viking put back that night for
newport bucking the stiff breeze un-
der orders of full speed ahead it was
not a very genial party but for my
part i was happy enough to have es-
caped the shadow of arrest shawn
came into my stateroom that night to
smoke a cigarette with me

   i am sorry i couldnt tell you
frank he apologized but i knew you
could act your part better if you didnt
know and then this morning it amused
me to see you trying to answer your
apprehensions with your faith in your
worthless friend it was the only way
i could devise to turn that bhuidering
old highbinders scheme into honest
profit i gave the merest hint to
archer our investments in atlantic
general were made with his firm with
instructions to buy-not to sell as of
course you expected frank but to buy
-and to pyramid all day archer
seems to be a man of intelligence in
spite of his fondness for the grape the
only thing that troubled me was that
sleeping powder in bemis pocket i
got hold of it as soon as i could-and
i flatter myself that even you frank
dont know when that was they are
dangerous things to carry i myself
should never have thought of using
one but having it handy naturally sug-
gested dropping it into the wine which
bemis had ordered watered for his own
consumption we have made an en-
emy but we have made a strong friend
too and archer only needed one day
to make himself the strongest man in
america how would you like to buy
a yacht like this one frank

my friend the eneimy

by robert j pearsall

author of revolt  picked for serviceetc

this thing of loving your enemy is all right to sing about but it has small place
in the council halls of the nations when war is declared here is an instance-one
of the rarest sort-where a soldier makes a friend of the enemy the results are curious

it was me mused sergeant nichols
lord it zvas me though id be
more satisfied if i could see the
muster roll detached would be
opposite my name but for what and
why i was detached no adjutant ever
discovered and first i was right or
last i was right and the other wrong
but which was which ive never rightly
discovered myself

  hurriedly to prevent interruption i
kicked corporal gordon on the shin
refilled sergeant kellys glass and pro-
duced cigars but nichols refilled his
pipe while he was getting an even
glow he surveyed us critically then
after a long puff he began his narrative

  it isnt every one id tell this to for
the most of it does me no credit but
two of you are marines and the other
as good i guess and all of youve been
younger than you are so you ought to
understand young uns and thats
what we were boys the lot of us ex-
cepting the noncoms and raw recruits
at that

  wed made one liberty in manila
from the deck of the transport and
spent five days leaning over the rail of
a gunboat southbound and that was
all we knew of the islands and what-
ever wed imagined of soldiering in
them was knocked cold our first day in
bantaigas maybe it was because we
were recruits that we were sent there

but if so its another proof that all the
wisdom of the world doesnt abide with
headquarters one week in the field
and wed been fit for anything but as
it was captain malden had as neat a
chest of human dynamite as ever man
was required to sit on and he was of-
ficer enough to know it

  bantaigas was a lighthouse and cable
station on a spit of sand and rock half-
way down the western coast of min-
danao by nature it was an island but
the spaniards had connected it with the
mainland by a narrow stone causeway
it was about five hundred yards long
by two hundred wide not figuring the
causeway and from end to end there
wasnt a tree nor a shrub nor a blade
of grass there was just us twenty-
five of us and we were forbidden to
swim for fear of sharks and to hike
for fear of natives and all the drilling
we were able to do on our two-by-twice
parade ground wouldnt have put a dint
in the energy of a company in the old
soldiers home

  ill not take time to explain how
things began to shape up or why it
was all natural the only thing that
dont seem natural to me is the part i
played in it me sergeant nichols
steady old plow horse-but i was a
two-year-old then and from the first
as i remember i led the agitators i
was kicker in chief sea lawyer in gen-
eral  and if ever ive heard a rookie ex-
my friend the enemy



press a fool opinion about the service
that i didnt express and swar by i
dont recall it

  i kicked about everything- the food
the restrictions the drills the tents-
we were sleeping of course in shelter
halves-but mainly i kicked about be-
ing there at all i got the bug-you see
its natural for me to refer to it dis-
respectfully by now-the idea well say
that many a civilian had at that time
the natives were peaceable all they
wanted was to be left alone if they
were treated as friends theyd be
friends but of course if they were
treated as enemies theyd be enemies
it was all a job an office holders job a
trick to keep the army in the islands so
as to provide some more swivel-chair
patriots and shoulder-strapped aristo-
crats with easy billets but why should
we sizzle on that blame flapjack of an
island for their sakes that was me
morning till night and the thing that
made me dangerous was that i believed
every word of it myself

  and of course i had my assistants
between them and me and natural per-
versity and the healthy human energy of
those cooped-up recruits i can see now
that at the end of a month things were
near the breaking point its hard to
say what wouldve happened mutiny
maybe more likely only a quarrel
among ourselves and a free-for-all fight
or a general liberty breaking and a
big drunk for some of us knew the art
of making bino-but as i hinted before
captain malden was an officer that
knew his trade one morning at office
hours i found myself in front of his
desk with him sizing me up and talking
me over to himself much the same as
though id been a bale of cotton

  whats the matter with you he
asked me toward the last

  i dont know sir and i was tell-
ing the truth standing before him so
and after his talk i knew id done him
an injustice and yet so help me there

was -something bubbling up in me that
wouldnt let me feel repentant nor yet
afraid thats youth i guess that
devil-may-careness that unmoral rest-
lessness and its a trouble maker but
glory me it has its advantages too

  youve done a lot of mischief and
youre liable to do a lot more went
on the captain youve got half the
men believing that theyre not getting
their full rations that theres a leak in
the q m now i happen to be quar-
termaster as well as commanding of-
ficer here-but well let that go and
youve preached that rot about the ma-
lanaos until youve got them believing
that too why i even heard you the
morning we planted that alarm on the
causeway-the alarm that may save a
sentrys life some night or all of our
lives for that matter-spieling about
our lack of trust and swearing that was
the sort of thing that caused all our
trouble trust youd trust those
monkey-minded twist-brained savages
are you a soldier or a sky pilot

  a soldier sir i said that rather
hurt me

  well youll have to learn to act like
one theres no room in this detach-
ment for an agitator you know weve
no brig here and that im the only of-
ficer in three hundred miles and no
chance of a court-martial and you take

advantage- no i wont say that

if i thought that was all there was to
it id ship you back to manila in irons
but im responsible for this command
and youve gone as far as i can allow
you to here take these

  they were two perfectly regular or-
ders one informed me that i was
temporarily detached from the com-
mand and would proceed at once with
shelter tent and full equipment to a
point on the mainland not over one
hundred yards from the eastern end of
the causeway and there encamp my
duties were to keep the detachment in-
formed of all movements of natives in


the popular magazine

the vicinity i was to report at reveille
and retreat to the sentry on the cause- t
way but was not to cross his post un-
less in case of an emergency the
other was a requisition on the quarter-
master sergeant for ten days rations

  i was a recruit but id heard of men
being beached before i didnt need the
captains explanation

  report to cornell he finished and
if i find he gives you an ounce more or
less than that order calls for ill have
him broke youve kicked at the mess 
make your own mess youve kicked
at the camp make your own camp and
at the end of ten days if you still like
it come in and draw more rations
whenever youre ready to soldier come
in and stay thats all

  no it wasnt murder as youll see
he wasnt even putting me in any spe-
cial danger if i did my duty kept
my eyes open remembered that i was
in an enemys country id besafer even
than the sentry on the causeway for
the natives would know where he was
and would know too that theyd have
to pass him in order to get to the de-
tachment a single boloman might spy
me out but the malanaos were pretty
well disciplined at that time and made
war when they did in a body of
course i didnt know anything about
these matters at the time but the cap-
tain did and i suppose he weighed
them pretty well before taking action

  well i went to my tent and packed
while the rest of the men stood around
and either cheered or jeered me ac-
cording to their turn of mind but
there were more cheers than jeers and
i left them laughing not at me but
with me which shows i wasnt an ordi-
nary trouble maker when i passed
the captains tent i saluted it sarcastic-
like so that they laughed some more
no one should think he had me bluffed
or even worried

  i whistled my way past the sentry on
the causeway and i sang through the

operation of tent pitching and camp
making and it wasnt pretense i was
happy that pent-in cramped-up feel-
ing was all gone and i felt as free as
the wind that rustled through the bam-
boos or the birds that sang in them
and there was green grass here instead
o bare rock and cool shade instead
of the blazing sun and by the time id
got everything fixed shipshape i was
just tired enough to lie down and smoke
and enjoy it and lay out my plans for
the next day for of course i con-
sidered the captains instructions about
looking out for natives as so much flub-
dub  he had to give me something to
do the hours between reveille and
retreat were my own

  and i must say before going on
that i enjoyed them it was fine to hear
the bugle sound for drill and to lie in
some cool spot and watch the fellows
rushing from their tents and falling into
line it was fine to hear taps sound and
to break out a bit of reading and a sec-
ond candle just for contrarities sake
knowing that over in the camp the ser-
geant of the guard was passing the hail
of lights out and it was finer still
to start out in the morning with haver-
sack and canteen and rifle and to tramp
and tramp and tramp with no captain to
pick my course for me and no corporal
to measure the length of my stride

  still i guess i was getting lonesome
i remember the second or third time i
reported to the sentry on the causeway
i hung around for a minute or two
hoping against hope that hed forget the
regulations and stop and talk a bit i
just wanted to hear the sound of his
voice and id catch myself staring
with a sort of empty feeling across
the half mile or so of water that sepa-
rated me from the camp oftener than
i liked maybe at the end of the ten
days id have been glad enough to come
in but a lot was to happen before then

  the third day i took stock of my
rations and found them most amazingly
my frienv the enemy	

shrunken i blamed it on my long
hikes and consequent big appetite and
i suppose it was partly due to my waste-
ful methods of cooking but anyway
it was calculated to give me a little bet-
ter opinion of the men that ran the camp
mess but i had no intention of going
hungry as long as there was game and
the nexlt day along toward evening i
was lucky enough to bring down a deer

  after id carried the parts that i
fancied to camp and hung them up i
happened to remember some shooting-
gallery instructions and i pieced to-
-gether my sections of ramrod and went
after the powder fouling in the bore of
my rifle with a bit of cloth but id
no more than started when i discov-
ered that there was more than the bore
that needed cleaning the nights had
been damp and there were little specks
of red rust all over the bright work and
some had even crept in between the
barrel and the stock

   well i took it apart and cleaned it
i was soldier enough for that but the
next thing i did wasnt at all soldierly
considering where i was by the time
the pieces were ready to reassemble i
was hungry i left them where they
were scattered out on my blanket and
started to build a fire in the stove id
improvised out of some rocks and a
piece of tin

   i didnt hear anything i dont know
what made me look up but i did just
as id started slicing the venison and
i found myself staring straight into a
pair of round black eyes set in a brown
face peeping out of the shrubbery
then quick as lightning the eyes and
 the face were gone and still there
wasnt even the rustle of a leaf

  my own eyes went to the pieces of
my rifle lying there as useless as so
many of these poker chips i wont
say i wasnt scared but i do claim i
grinned id fixed things so that my
theory as to the innate gentleness and
friendliness of the natives was going to

be tested and that within a very few
seconds a sort of creeping sensation
came over my skin as though every
inch of it was shrinking from the touch
of a bolo and my ears strained till
they ached for the whir of one through
the air but i kept on as steadily as
i could carving up the meat

  that lasted about a minute then a
peculiar sound began in the bushes some
dozen feet or so to the right of where
id seen the face it was the sound of
a man crawling and yet there was
something i straightened up and
faced it relieved but puzzled too for if
the man was coming to me openly why
didnt he walk upright

  but the next minute the bushes
parted and i knew a head and as
perfect a pair of shoulders as ive ever
laid eyes on shoved through the brown
body followed and the legs trailed be-
hind just trailed without a movement
he was crippled from his hips down
he was so strong in the arms and shoul-
ders though that he moved even in
that position almost as fast as i would
walk and as easy that took away
some of the pitifulness of it

  he wore a breechclout and a flaming
red sash and a belt with a three-foot
bolo it was the first id seen but id
heard enough about them that i
stared at it half fascinated thinking
how easy it would have been for him
to have cut md down with it from the
brush then my eyes came back to his
face and i didnt feel quite safe yet
he was smiling but it wasnt a healthy
smile  there was something forced about
it his eyes were tense and watchful
and i noticed that his right hand as
he came forward was never placed
much in advance of his shoulder it
was always near the bolo hilt

  well i smiled my broadest and was
rewarded in a way i didnt expect he
hitched himself around sat up well out
of my reach and spoke

  goo day he said me amigo


the popular magazine

  now amigo didnt mean anything
to me then i thought it was his name
i bade amigo welcome in as flowery
language as i could find and the way
i used the word seemed to please him
then i waved my hand at the food and
the fire by and by we eat i said

  but he sort of stiffened at that me
no want eat he said me all lone
you all lone me amigo

  you see he couldnt have said any-
thing that warmed me to him more
though he seemed to draw back into
himself the moment hed said it but
while he sat there silent as an owl i
cooked up a double ration of every-
thing and a little more and he ate
after a great deal of urging but he
insisted again several times that i
understand that that wasnt what hed
come for and after the meal was over
and id pressed upon him a package of
londre cigarettes that id bought in
manila but hadnt got down to smoking
yet he loosened up and told me his
story

  he was a malanao a member of a
tribe whose village was some fifty miles
inland hed been in manila though
worked for a white man which was
where hed picked up his english he
liked white men some white men he
was careful to qualify but hed come
back to his tribe to marry and a rival
lover had set a trap for him a bamboo
trap he showed me how it worked a
bolo fastened between two bent bam-
boos a slip cord how hed stepped over
the bolo into the cord how the bolo
had leaped up and caught him behind
at the knees hamstrung he was for
life and the children of the village
laughed at him and the older people
pitied him and he had gone away to
live alone oh he was some romancer
he had seen me and he liked me but
he didnt want to see the other white
men pointing across to bantaigas
some of them would laugh too

  i hardly believed that but it was

plain that if i reported his presence
captain malden would investigate it
and id lose amigos confidence and
i didnt want to do that so when re-
treat sounded i went out on the cause-
way walked down as far as the barrier
of buried wires waited till the sentry
came up and reported alls well
then back again and that night the
monkey-minded twist-brained sav-
age as captain malden had called him
shared my shelter tent and never
since that time have i taken stock in
the idea that a mans instincts warn
him of danger    but i woke in
the morning safe enough

  well there followed four peculiar
days amigo as i still called him stuck
to me like a brother we couldnt
travel far in a day but we didnt have
to he knew his jungle tracks and
trails and watering places and he could
move through it like a shadow and take
his pick of what was in it and before
long from imitating him i got to be
almost as skillful the only trouble was
that his list of food animals was a bit
more inclusive than mine but after
wed spent an hour following a certain
kind of cat that will never be domesti-
cated i took to instructing him in this
regard and i must say that i found
him flatteringly willing to change his
standards

  and he was good company too of
course he hadnt many words but he
made those he had useful he told me
about his people how they lived in bam-
boo boxes mounted on stilts or perched
in the crotches of the palm trees that
sprung out of the mud of the river bed
how they tilled their fields of palay
and rice with sharp sticks and wooden
plows how they fished and hunted
with their praos and dragnets and har-
poons and bows and arrows oh it
was a domestic picture he drew and
this was the bloodthirsty tribe for fear
of which captain malden had cooped
his men on bantaigas  i wondered how
my frienv the enemy



long the men would stand it after they
found out the truth

  i believed him and as the days
passed by i got to like him more and
more of course that was to be ex-
pected i suppose a man would get
fond of a rattler if he was alone with
it night and day long enough and i
suppose the rattler might get fond of
him not that thats a fair comparison
but-

  at the same time i couldnt hide the
fact that there were things about him
i didnt understand for one there was
the peculiar gleam that would come to
his eyes sometimes just when wed
seem to be friendliest a gleam that
made me watch his hand that was near-
est his bolo in spite of myself and
yet my reason told me that he could
have killed me a dozen times while i
slept but his face would twitch and
the muscles of his arms and even of
his crippled legs of course id never
heard then of the juramentado if i
had it would have been me to ban-
taigas and on the double

  many a time id seen him staring
over toward bantaigas especially when
the men were at drill he seemed to
be studying them and i knew every
move i made he watched once he
asked me why i reported to the sentry
on the causeway and when id satis-
fied him as to that why i always stood
just where i did i didnt like his no-
ticing that why you no walk to sen-
try why you stand little ways away
at night at morning you go close
why you no go close at night

  i told him it was the rules but of
course that wasnt- any explanation
the real reason that if i took one step
farther id set off captain maldens pet
electric contrivance the alarm thatd
bring every man out of his tent double
time and under arms-no i swear i
wasnt fool enough to tell him that
and that the beggard have sense

enough to figure it out for himself i
never surmised for a moment

  then there were other things hed
never touch me not once during the
four days did his hand touch mine or
any part of me and whenever id
seem about to touch him when we were
skinning a deer or doing suchlike work
hed draw away as though i were so
much carrion and there was the big
fact the thing id noticed when i first
laid eyes on him that his useless legs
instead of being shriveled and shrunken
were as tight-skinned and firm-fleshed
as the legs of a marathon runner id
seen it i say but it was with my eyes
only until the third night i never gave
the matter another thought

  that night i woke with a feeling of
missing something i rolled over and
discovered that my tentmate wasnt in
his place that puzzled me a bit and
i was considering what to do when i
heard something that made me settle
down again mighty quiet some one
was moving in the brush-but it
couldnt be amigo for this man wasnt
crawling it was quite a little distance
and i could hear the footsteps but the
difference was plain enough

  i lay there for about a minute
frankly i didnt like the thought of in-
vestigating the night was like a black
cat and if there was anything wrong
itd be two against one and id learned
enough the last few days of the ma-
lanao art of bushwhacking to know
what chance id have but it seemed
like i had it to do and id forced my-
self to the flap of the tent when i heard
amigo coming back again just amigo 
there was no mistaking that scraping
dragging sound i crawled back into
my blanket but i got no more sleep that
night

  the next morning i noticed some-
thing strange about him hed look at
me sometimes and his black eyes
would kind of soften like a dogs i had
once and then hed force them away


the popular magazine

from me and his face would go hard
and that crazy look that had half fright-
ened me the first few days would come
back to it and there was a sort of
gloating in it now the look that you see
in a cats eyes that has a mouse help-
less and is playing with it and after
breakfast was over he sat for a little
staring at the brush and then he an-
nounced abruptlike that he was going
to be away for the rest of the day but
would return at night

  this big malanao church day he
said all malanaos go out alone to-
day stay alone i like you you good
friend but me stay alone and i
liked him and was mighty glad of the
excuse hed given it didnt take much
imagination to see that some such thing
might be the explanation of last nights
visitor-for mark you i still held to
the idea that the steps id heard had
been the steps of a visitor a courier
probably to remind him of a religious
rite

  so he left-and i missed him gee
how i missed him i guess a man just
naturally has to have some one or
something to care for and the few days
hed been alone with me counted for as
much as so many months of ordinary
companionship and i was mighty
glad to see him come crawling back
along toward night but i wasnt glad
for the change in him the softness
had all gone out of him he was short
and curt with his words and if a stran-
ger had looked at me as he did now
mid then id have reached for my gun
but he couldnt harm me he couldnt
after all id done for him and so we
slept as usual that night side by side
with either at the mercy of the one that
chose to keep awake and we both
woke in the morning sound but the
same half-mad look was on him

  i hadnt hunted the day before and
our meat was about gone so after wed
eaten we went out after game the
same as always before he creeping

along in advance i on my toes behind
him trying to move as noiselessly as
he and mostly failing by noon we
had three rabbits and we started to
work back toward camp

  all of youve been in the islands and
you know how sudden a bagnio comes
in the open if youre a native or an
old-timer you have the warning of it
at first a black spot lying low with the
clear sky above and all around it then
a coppery monster of a cloud that seems
to grow and fill the heavens as it rushes
on you but what sky we might have
seen through the underbrush was cut
off by the palms andmolaves and the
only notice we had was a sudden dark-
ening and a great moan like the jungle
knew what was coming on it and was
afraid amigo looked back at me said
something i didnt catch and then the
storm struck us

  it was a howling rush of wind and
a driving sheet of water and though
most of the force of it stayed in the
treetops it was all i could do to stand
up against it but i did and i cleared
my eyes and head in time to catch an-
other backward look from amigo a
swing of the hand ahead and two
words trees fall he shouted and
before id fully got the meaning of his
words they were interpreted for me
there was a crash behind me i looked
back and saw that a calentas about a
hundred feet high and studded with
short thick branches almost like giant
thorns had hit the ground with all the
force of the wind behind it it would
have been taps for any one that had
been caught under it

  amigo had mended his pace he was
straining ahead at what was for me a
fast walk i followed him glad enough
that he was there i wouldnt have
known which way to turn i kept a
sharp lookout however and skirted
around any tree that seemed danger-
ous but amigo from his position
my friend the enemy



couldnt see as well as i which prob-
ably accounts for what happened

  hed almost reached safety a clear
space about a hundred yards across that
hed had in his mind from the start
and he glanced back to see if i was
following him he looked over his
right shoulder and at the same instant
about fifty feet to his left another cal-
entas snapped short off at the bottom
and flung itself straight at him

  his ears told him of his danger as
quickly as my eyes for an instant i
thought a miracle was going to hap-
pen that his dead legs were coming to
life again indeed he did raise part
way to his knees but as i started for
him he collapsed again his arms
however were working like pistons but
not more than half fast enough to
carry him out of the path of the tree

  yes you heard mesay i started for
him oh i dont claim any credit for
it it wras just impulse you know the
way a babys helplessness gets to you
-well his affected me in much the same
way before i knew it i had both
arms around him beneath the shoulder
and was racing with the falling tree

  i thought id lost the race-that
thought and a ripping pain at the back
of the head and an explosion of lights
and then sudden darkness is all i can
remember after the tree or rather the
end of one of the branches struck me
but i came to after a bit and found
myself lying well out in the clearing
with the rain beating down on my face
and none the worse except for a head-
ache amigo was bending over me
he had one of my hands but as my
eyes opened he dropped it

  you hurt he asked you all
right-amigo 

  it was the first time he called me
by that word and i wondered what he
meant by applying his own name to me
but i let it pass i twisted around a
bit and then got to my feet

  im all right i said and how

about you i remembered hed been
under me when i fell

  you save me he answered me
thank you me no forget

  that was about all there was to it
the malanao isnt emotional and in
another minute the wind having died
down as suddenly as it had risen we
were on our way again but for the
rest of that hike and even after wed
reached camp and straightened it up
after the storm and prepared supper
and eaten it i wasnt easy in mind it
was plainer than ever that there was
something wrong with amigo

  he wouldnt look at me he wouldnt
really look at anything he stared off
into the jungle but i knew he wasnt
seeing it now and then though hed
stir restlessly as though he were try-
ing to wake himself or make up his
mind to something or change his
thoughts sometimes when he did that
his hand would creep back toward his
bolo and the old fanatical glare would
begin to show up in his eyes but it
never reached full growth that night
something else that doglike softness
seemed to well up and cloud it over and
drown it out and then his shoulders
would droop and creases would come
in his brown forehead

  if hed been a white man of course
id have tried to get to the bottom of
his trouble but you know it isnt
merely that one mans white and the
other brown and even the shape of the
brain and the make-up of the body seem
to be only the signs of the difference
the real difference is deeper-and yet
there must be a deal in common too
i could see afterward that he tried to
do what i hadnt the courage to do
he tried to bridge the gap

  it was about time for taps we were
lying in the shelter tent and i was be-
ginning to doze when i heard amigo
stir and then speak

  you my friend he said me your
friend me think so tree hit you


the epocpular magazine

maybe you die you no care you
sleep maybe me kill you you no
fraid we be very good friends it
was a mixture of a statement and a
question he seemed to be considering
the thing

  thats so i said and yet to save
me i couldnt keep a note of doubt out
of my own voice

  you americano he went on more
slowly as though he were searching for
ideas as well as words me see in
manila americano know all things
you tell me why you americano why
me malanao why you white why me
black  why one day we fight why one
day we be friends why one man tell
me kill you why myself tell me love
you you tell me

  lord knows was the best reply i
had but youre not going to do any
killing are you

  the answer wasnt quick in coming
no me no kill you he said at last
but still there was a sort of uncertainty
in his voice as though he had another
problem

  neither of us spoke again but i was
doing a heap of thinking oh i know
i should have acted i should have
acted long before that but you see
i couldnt give up my theory amigo
was a friend he had to be for id
treated him as such and i was right
and i was wrong and the devil and all
knows which i was mainly

  after a bit i slept-and then i woke
fighting some one had me by both
shoulders and was dragging me to my
feet my first thought as i aimed a
blow at him was that it couldnt be
amigo for this man was standing up-
right and shaking me with the strength
of a giant and then i began to sense
the words that he was pouring into
my ears

  wake up  no too later   
wake up wake up    save ameri-
canos    swimming cross   
me amigo amigo and my right fist

that had already started up stopped just
short of his chin

  amigo  you  in the name of-

  no importe me malanaos they kill
americanos they come back kill you
they no cross causeway they know
bout trap wire me tell them me
what you call spy no leg hurt all right
you no savvy

  i savvied and i agreed with him no
importe him or me either id betrayed
my trust hed betrayed my friendship
and neither of us had many minutes to
repair our fault i was scrambling out
of my tent with my rifle and ammuni-
tion belt in my hand as i fired the next
question at him

 how many

  whole tribe maybe hundreds
  where are they

  i tell you in water swimming no
fraid sharks sharks get two maybe
three rest get cross they swim to
sentry bolo sentry no noise then camp
then you that why--

  i didnt hear any more i was busy
with my rifle five times i fired as
fast as i could work the bolt and pull
the trigger and as i fired i ran and as
i ran i yelled by the time my maga-
zine was empty i wa at the jungle end
of the causeway with amigo just be-
hind me

 post number one the guard
crackled out ahead of me and my blood
ran warmer the malanos hadnt got
the sentry yet two shots followed an
interval and then three more fired ir-
regularly and i was charging up the
causeway bellowing dont shoot
nichols nichols at the top of my
voice

  the sentry was the cool hand as
i tore over the buried wires and set off
the belated alarm in the garrison i
caught sight of him he was lying
crossways of the causeway with his
head sticking over the west bank study-
ing the water and whenever he caught
sight of a bobbing black spot in it he
my friencd the enemy



fired but that wasnt often for the
night was black and the water was
black and the malanaos knowing that
they were discovered were mostly
swimming under water

  i wondered why he didnt make for
the garrison but as i plumped myself
down beside him my knee went into
something warm and wet but when i
went to feeling for the wound he
twitched away from me

  never mind he grunted bolo-
thigh-just a scratch the next time

you come up my brown brother-

theyd have got me if youd been a sec-
ond later with your shots they were
just coming over the bank-look out

  hed caught sight of amigo but i
gripped his rifle and shoved it down
hes all right i said came with
me- there it goes

  it was call to arms i could imagine
the scramble in the tents the grabbing
in the dark for shoes and rifles and
bayonets and what-not the lazy ones
whod have to be pulled out of their
bunks the excitable ones whod got
the wrong accouterments the wise
ones whod come out half equipped
sure it was a drill and not a real
alarm as it wras theyd have time
to straighten up but if it hadnt
been for amigos last-minute repentance
and the malanaos had found them in
their bunks-well even now id rather
not think of what would have happened
to them

  there were no more black spots in
the water the malanaos having passed
us were leaving it taking to the cause-
way we could hear them scrambling
up the bank of a sudden there was a
single yell then a chorus of them

  i wonder said the sentry are we
out of it or aint we if we are-

  my rifle answered him id heard
just the faintest rustling ahead and by
straining my eyes i could make out
something moving but at the sound
of my shot the moving something leaped

upright and four others with it and
they came down upon us side by side
in a rush

  i got one man the sentry another
and then i heard a whir and a thud
and the sentry slumped down on his
face the bolo that had struck his head
glancing off behind him i fired point-
blank and the third native crashed
down almost at my feet but there
were two left and one was right upon
me his bolo arm darting out and up
from his side i leaped inside his
stroke and heard the bolo whistle down
behind me as i caught him around the
body

  then i knew they had me and he
knew it too for his arms closed on me
as we whirled i could see the other
malanao whirling with us looking for
an opening i got one glimpse of
amigo and my last hope died for his
hands were empty his bolo still in its
sheath

  i tried to use the natives body as a
shield but suddenly he twisted and i
knew i was exposed i threw myself
forward tripping him and we fell to
the ground but he was on the bottom
i on top and he held me so with the
whole length of me open for the stroke
of the others bolo

  i wraited for it quivering but it
didnt come instead i heard the sound
of a surprised snarl and of a tearing
up of earth and then heavy dragging
steps mixed with a regular torrent of
angry words i twisted my head around
and saw amigo with the other ma-
lanao struggling like a wild cat in his
arms standing at the edge of the
causeway he braced himself gave a
great heave and his load shot into the
water then he turned came back to
where i was still wrestling with my
slippery foe and stood silent looking
down on us hed do no more for me

  as it happened though i didnt need
his help singly my native was no


the popular magazine

match for me i couldve killed him or
i couldve taken him prisoner but i
did neither he followed the other into
the water and i could hear them strik-
ing out for the jungle and felt some
way no temptation to send a shot after
them

  all this time the air had been filled
with the rattling of rifle fire and i
hadnt been too much occupied to feel
the chill of two bullets as they ripped
past close to my head now came a
regular storm of them and i realized
that the whole detachment must be fir-
ing straight down the causeway i felt
amigos hand on my arm

  my people come back he said and
i thought there was a great sadness in
his voice

  we were in their path and there was
only one hiding place the sentry was
beyond any further hurt as i knew
from the first touch of him but i
couldnt leave his body to be tramped
i dragged it over the edge of the cause-
way down to the waters edge and
amigo slipped down beside me the
next minute there was the pattering of
bare feet above us the malanaos were
being driven pell-mell

  something came plunging down the
bank almost upon amigo it would

have gone into the water but he caught
and held it and i saw that it was a
malanao and that his body was as limp
and dead as that other body that lay at
my right and then above us shod
feet followed the bare and the crackling
rifle fire went on toward the jungle

  it was a long minute before i spoke
and then my voice didnt sound like i
wanted it to we can go now i said
i felt amigos body stiffen

  ill tell the captain what you did
i went on hell be your friend same
as me hell send you back to manila

get you very good job i-

  amigo had let loose his hold on the
dead body and it slipped down into the
water i stopped and i knew what he
was going to say before he spoke

  you go me go other way

  but you cant i- cried theyll
kill you that man you let go will tell

them-

  maybe so but they my people i
know now good-by with the last
word he followed his dead into the
water

  and i lying there with my own dead
beside me was sorry to see him go and
yet glad and whether i was more glad
than sorry or the other way about is a
thing ive never been able to decide

what the book says

al ajor j j dickinson is an official of the state department in washington
and a kentucky gentleman of the highest order having been born in the
good old days he is fully alive to the value of any well-bred person having behind
him a long line of distinguished ancestors

    one day his son julian was reading a book about inventions

    i wonder who invented the typewriter observed julian turning over the
pages

    ill tell you who invented the typewriter suh said the major with great
dignity that book wont tell you those infernal books are always wrong
but the man who invented the typewriter was my uncle and guardian colonel
r t p allen thats the inventor of the typewriter now look in your darned
old book what does it say 

    it says colonel r t p allen julian informed him

    fine approved the major let me have that book ill bet its the
best book i ever read

if you have never been to a moving-
 picture show you might as well go
at once-for go you will sooner or later
and its worth while going now and then
but unless you want to lose in energy
and ambition dont get into the habit of
it if you feel however that you have
too much vitality that your brain is too
keen and active that you have too much
enterprise that you are generally too
stirring and successful and getting ahead
of other people all the time-then by
all means go to the movies every night
get to be a regular movie fan con-
sider a new production at your favorite
theater more important than the destruc-
tion of a city or the opening of a great
waterway do this and you will be giv-
ing other ambitious and deserving peo-
ple a better chance in the life struggle
you will surely become a humdrum con-
tented and after a while rather unin-
teresting citizen there are other kinds
of dope besides the things the druggists
refuse to sell without a prescription
and the movies in excess is one of the
least harmful and efficacious

a a

the trouble with the movies is that
 they cant talk we know enough
already of the history of the world to
know that language is the thing that
counts it was the ability to speak a
few gutturals that picked out some
family of apes to be the ancestors of
mankind everything facjes and perishes
but the written language it expresses
ideas which music cannot do it records
actions in time where sculpture and
painting fail it gives us everything of
life through the medium of the brain
and the imagination an idealistic litera-

ture is the sure foundation of mental
and material development shakespeare
and milton set free the minds of men so
that the great discoveries in material
science in the centuries that followed
them became possible stories and poems
are the things that arouse the minds and
imaginations of men that stir the intel-
lect to activity that create in humans
that divine discontent that makes ad-
vancement and progress possible and in-
evitable and the poems and the stories
must be of the romantic idealistic type
or they have none of the divine stimulus
in them realism may be a good an-
tiseptic or corrective against idealism
that is false or spoiled but in itself
realism is barren and can produce noth-
ing the movies are realism gone mad
or which is quite as bad realism carried
to its logical conclusion you see every-
thing on the screen the actual yacht
which takes fire and burns before your
eyes the hero as he plunges into gen-
uine water-you can see the splash and
the spray-and swims off the trouble
with the movies is that all the non-
essentials are there but the essentials
are not it is the soul of the hero that
counts not his appearance as he jumps
into the water but what he is thinking
you can see an urchin take a dive at
the foot of any dock but what your
hero feels and thinks can only be told
in words

 

we have no doubt at all that the
novel at the moon trails end
which appears complete in the next issue
of the pouplar would make a splendid
six-reel picture theres enough action
in it enough thrill enough breathless
and exciting incident if you want an
a chat with you-continued

ideal character for an adventurous story
on the screen we can think of no one
better or more interesting than bob cor-
rigan tlie central figure in the novel
we know of  actor however no mat-
ter howr accomplished who can make
bob seem as real and alive to us as
william slavens macnutt the author
does in the pages of his novel it is
quite likely that at the moon trails
end will appear soon either as a play
or a picture play but we confess that
for our part we prefer it as a novel
if a man reall- knows how to write if
he has something big to say and some-
thing interesting to describe it is ten
times more satisfactory and stirring to
read what he writes than to look at any
pantomimic representation if a story
interests you and absorbs jour attention
it is a good story but if it does a little
something more than that-if it stirs
your blood and wakens a new life and
energy in you it is a little better than
good the reading of at the moon
trails end will give you more genuine
thrills than watching any picture ever
w ill because it lias in it something of
the soul of life which is infinitely more
interesting and precious than its outward
and visible form

	a

another case in point is the story
called the projectile written by
edwin balmer and also in the next issue
of the populak it would be possible
to give some idea of this story in a
photo play but all the intimacy all the
finer understanding would be gone you
would be able to see the dash of the
aeroplane against the zeppelin you
might get some idea of the line of gray
battleships stretched in a great crescent
across the gray north sea you might
see the heros wild plunge as he is
thrown from the soaring plane and
plunges into the deep between tile bat-
tling fleets but you can get no idea

save through the medium of the printed
word of the feelings and emotions of
the american and of the strange per-
sonality of the girl who has assumed
command of the aeroplane and whose
will for a moment or so dominates the
whole scone of battle no one can read
either of these stories without feeling a
certain wholesome stimulus without be-
ing a little more alive and awake for the
experience and of the many great
services that literature does this is one
of the mos important

thing

ontrast not harmony is the
 spice of dress it is surprising
how many men fall into the error of
dressing in a single color under the im-
pression that this is smart it is many
removes from being smart or even
pleasing

  a brown suit brown-striped shirt
brown neckscarf brown hat brown
gloves and brown boots create a mo-
notony of color which is negative and
insipid your dress needs high lights
to throw it into relief and these are
supplied by contrasting colors as brown
with green and
gray with purple

the o ny
to consider about a
hat is to get a
shape that becomes
y o u r h e a d and
face if you do
this your stock
will go up several
points with your-
self m any men
wear a hat that
would look capital
on somebody else

that its the latest
style seems but a
period after the
matter regardless
of whether the hat
suits the type

 all wrong

fashion in hats is
a protean affair it
can assume almost
any shape it
chooses and its

right if its becoming the new silk
hat for - has a tallish crown
slightly belled and a very narrow silk
not felt ribbon it is worn well over
the forehead instead of tilted upward

  its a smart shape if it suits your
face if it doesnt stick to something
less audacious for a silk hat is the fly
in the ointment of many a man whose
dress is otherwise impeccable

get rid of
 gun fear

these war times demand it

    evfry gim-sliy mother and every gun-shy daughter should get rid of gun
    fear specially in tiiee limes which make idlers which in turn muke
    more imrhirs and more brute for who knows when the left alone
    may hear the brute monsters knock at the kick door or who can tell
    when the dreaded burglar knowing them to be alone may hash the terror of
    his light and mask and gun in their helpless faces

    out into the hack lot witi your family and a harmless savage today
    when they discover its eas aim cracking ten light ling shots into the hulls
    eye watch their gun fear change into shooting enthusiasm their gun hate to
    gun affection their burglar and their brute terror to haughty indifference in
    other words watch them get rid of gun fear

    the savage shoots two to four more shots than any other automatic shoots
    only one shot per trigger pull but shoots as fast as you can crook your finger
    and is as harmless as a e it around the house because a toifeh or a look tells
    whether it is loaded or empty

cal crown to which frenchmen and
americans have been tolerant

  thick watch chains are no longer the
fashion one wears a thin fine-linked
gold chain this should not stretch
taut across between the lower pockets
of the waistcoat but should arch in the
center

  pins are only correct in neckscarfs
like the ascot which cannot be held in
place without them they should not be
worn with lounge suits

  since collars were out with open-
spaced rounded-off fronts the waist-
coat openings were lowered neckscarfs
had to be broadened to let them be
pulled up right and tight an innova-
tion is the four-in-hand puff

  this is made with a longish narrow
knot and very broad puffed aprons that
are flipped out from the shirt with a
marked bulge the effect is midway
between that of a four-in-hand and the
ascot

  to get this carefully careless
bulge or flip to your scarf it should be
pinned up underneath a small gold
safety pin serves admirably and will
not become undone

  figured designs-traceries vine and
leaf patterns splash treatments and
the like are more fashionable in neek-
scarfs than stripes which have staled
from excessive use though they are in
no wise outmoded

  evening suits are now seldom worn
in plain patterns hut rather in birds-
eye basket-weave diminutive check
and crisscross designs so loomed that
artificial light throws them into clearer
relief

  if you dance much the weight of
your evening suit makes an appreciable
difference between comfort and an in-
voluntary turkish bath

  if you dance little or not at all
heavier fabrics are preferable because
they keep shape better-sleeves are not
so prone to rumple trousers dont kick
up behind and the like

  in the present season tailoring of a
smart evening coat all the softness is
put into the lapels and tails which are
made as crushable as a handkerchief
the chest and body are kept tolerably
firm to drape well and ward off
wrinkles
