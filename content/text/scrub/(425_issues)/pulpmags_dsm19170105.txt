isabel curwood

do think suitors are the worst nui-
sance ever declared grace cur-
wood tossing one letter on the
floor as she opened another

    tis love tis love tis love that
makes the world go round chanted
isabel whos your troublesome
adorer 

   oh my adorers arent troublesome
its the one who wont adore who trou-
bles me

  oho the russian count wont
he bow at your pretty feet

  no he bows at yours and you
  i a ds

know it oh isabel do let me have
him

 have him indeed you may i
dont want him ill trade him for your
new spangled scarf

  but he wont be traded he wor-
ships the ground you walk on

  isabel in front of her toilet mirror
was tilting a new hat to the exact angle
of reflection and she pulled out a long
hatpin and pushed it in again without
speaking

  i cant see why you dislike him so
went on grace continuing to skim
through her letters oh i say heres
an invitation for the fords week-end
hes sure to be there theres the


detective story magazine

telephone of course its more of those
bothering suitors let me answer it
isabel it may be the count good
morning yes yes oh its you ed
yes isabel is here hold the wire
its ed stuart she said handing the
receiver to her sister such a come-
down after i hoped it was the count

  worth a hundred counts said isa-
bel gayly as she came over to the tele-
phone

  the ponsonby where the curwood
girls and their mother lived was one
of new yorks newest apartment
houses it was therefore overornate
as to architecture and decoration but
it was comfortable and luxurious and
so proved satisfactory to the pleasure-
seeking class that tenanted it

  though the curwoods were out of
town at such seasons as fashion de-
creed just now in mid-december they
were at home for matters of impor-
tance required their presence in the
city and too mrs curwood a ma-
tron of fashionable inclinations was
partial to new yorks winter gayeties

  mrs curwoods philosophy so far
as she had any was an unbounded will-
ingness to let everybody have his or
her-own way and as a result she and
her two daughters did exactly as they
chose in every respect but though in-
dividual and self-reliant the curwood
girls were not unconventional and as
they were both pretty and charming
they were acknowledged social favor-
ites

  isabel perhaps because she was the
elder was inclined to be dictatorial and
grace who adored her sister amiably
submitted to her dictates indeed the
russian count who had recently in-
vaded their social set was the cause of
graces first disagreement with her
sisters opinion

  why dont you like him isabel
she resumed as her sister turned away
from the telephone and returned to her

absorbing occupation of discovering the
exact frontage of the plumed hat

  of course i dont dislike him she
said you cant dislike anybody that
you never liked to begin with

  dont say clever things it doesnt
suit you-especially in that frivolous
hat if he saw you in that hed pro-
pose at once

  oh i dont know said isabel care-
lessly turning well round in her chair
as she moved a large hand mirror to
and fro before her eyes to get the re-
flected view of the back of her hat
sometimes grace i think its you
the count admires and not me

  oh isabel do you really i wish
i thought so but youre so much
handsomer and more attractive than i
am

  there there grade dont angle for
compliments from me you get enough
from the men

  yes i do but not from him oh
isabel isnt he grand

  he doesnt interest me at all ive
no use for a russian count and im
not sure he is a count though theres
no doubt hes a russian

  of course hes a count isabel said
mrs curwood coming into the room
that is if youre speaking of kovroff
as i suppose you are how absurd of
you to say such things no one doubts
count kovroffs title or wealth or
charm

all right mother said isabel gayly
i grant him all those attractions you
mention and as many more as you like
but all the same he doesnt appeal to
t

me

  no returned mrs curwood with
a reproving glance at her elder daugh-
ter you care only for ed stuart a
nonentity and a neer-do-well i hate
to see you throw yourself away on
young stuart you know as well as
i do that he has no money

  but i have enough for both
mother so why consider that question 
his hand and seal



  but your fortune wont last long
once ed stuart gets hold of it you
know his proclivities

  i know what you mean mother but
its merely rumor and you have net
right even to mention it

  i havent mentioned it returned
mrs curwood noting isabels indig-
nant expression

  pooh its an open secret declared
grace ill mention it myself ed
stuart gambles and everybody knows
it why all he wants is your money
well he can have it returned isa-
bel good-naturedly but first i must
get it myself mother guardy
weatherby says he has settled my af-
fairs and is going to pay me my
money

  oh i suppose thats all right child
but why arent you content to let it go
on as it is until youre married

  not i im an independent young
woman and im twenty-one years of
age so mr weatherbys guardianship
is legally at an end and i am glad of it
perfectly ridiculous for your uncle
albert to leave your fortune in mr
weatherbys care anyway said her
mother he should have made me
your guardian and xnot to do so was
rude and discourteous

  oh he didnt mean it that way
mother but mr weatherby as a busi-
ness man is much more capable of tak-
ing care of my money and looking after
it for me why he told me some years
ago that he had invested it so well that
he had nearly doubled it you couldnt
have done that

  no i couldnt youll be a rich
girl isabel and thats why i hate to

  oh i know what you hate to see
mother you neednt tell me youll
hate to see me walk up the church aisle
with mr weatherby and back again
with mr edwin stuart but youre
going to see it all the same so you
may as well make the best of it

   mr weatherby doesnt approve of
 it any more than i do said mrs cur-
 wood though knowing that the guard-
 ians opinion would have little weight
 with her willful daughter

   i know it mother but that only
 proves guardys poor taste and judg-
 ment he doesnt know ed very well
 and doesnt appreciate him oh well
 whats the use of being a free and in-
 dependent american citizen if you cant
 marry whom you like ill guarantee
  that after we are married and ed is
 one of the family you and grace will
 love him as a son and a brother just
 as i am also positive you never could
 make a satisfactory son and brother of
 any russian impostor

   count kovroff is no impostor said
 grace quietly and you know it isabel
 for some reason youre prejudiced
 against him and i know the reason
 too its because he knows something
 about ed stuart that you wish he didnt
 know

   grace youre horrid exclaimed
 isabel turning an angry face toward
 her sister i forbid you to say any-
 thing more against the man im going
 to marry and as to that old fake count
 i believe youre in love with him your-
 self

   i am not declared grace though
 the color rising to her cheeks contra-
 dicted her words

   you are so your blushes prove
 it youre as red as red

   there there girls dont quarrel
 said mrs curwood languidly its such
 bad form and it isnt a bit becoming
 and it doesnt do a bit of good
 supplemented isabel as having ad-
 justed her hat to her satisfaction she
 picked up her street coat hold this
 coat for me wont you gracie and
 dont quarrel any more and when
 guardy gives me my own check book
 ill buy you the prettiest necklace you
 can pick out on fifth avenue

   where are you going now isabel


detective story magazine

i thought you were going out to
luncheon with ed

  i am why

  i dont think this coat is dressy
enough why dont you put on some-
thing better

  oh this is all right a plain black
tailor-made is always correct and im
going to wear my gray feather boa-
its so becoming

  that old thing  it is becoming but
youve worn it so much im tired of
it

  i like it and im going to get a
lot of new things soon so ill only wear
it a few times more what are you
doing this afternoon mother

  im going to a bridge party and
afterward to mrs malcolms tea
grace will meet me there and youll
come too wont you isabel

  yes i think so im going to
luncheon with ed and then after that
im going to madame laurestines to
try on some gowns i shall spend some
time there but ill go on to mrs mal-
colms and meet you both say about
six

  yes or a bit earlier good-by
dearie where are you lunching

  at sherrys and then ed will take
me to madame laurestines

  isabel looked very beautiful as she
bade them a smiling good-by and went
away going down in the elevator she
gave a few admiring touches to her hat
and noted with satisfaction the mirrored
reflection she was of a large and
handsome type and though quite aware
of her own good looks she was not
vain or conceited she dressed in
rather better taste than her mother or
sister and to-day in her quiet black
cloth costume large black hat and light
gray feather boa she looked correct
and inconspicuous she took a taxicab
down to the restaurant and as it came
to a standstill at the niarquise edwin
stuart stood at the curb awaiting her
its a great thing isabel he said

after they were seated at the table he
had selected for a woman to wear
her clothes as well as you- do you
look perfectly well dressed in the plain-
est sort of a rig and lots of girls dont
one reason is youve a good idea of
color

  black isnt a color returned isabel
smiling

 it is for costume purposes and
that gray boa suits you awfully well
but i regret to say youll have to dis-
card it soon

  why it isnt old-fashioned

  no but it has seen its best days
see it sheds little bits of gray feather
all over your coat and mine too
he added as he picked a couple of
wisps of ostrich feather from his sleeve

  i wont wear it again said the girl
smiling grace told me it was passe
but im fond of the thing its so soft
and fluffy ed do you know theyre
still throwing that count at my head
are they dear well so long as
he doesnt reach your heart it doesnt
matter much but i wont have you
bothered isabel ill tell you what
lets go and get married this very after-
noon

  dont be ridiculous i dont want to
do anything so foolish

  im not ridiculous and it isnt fool-
ish you do want to marry me dont
you 

 yes but i want a wedding and a
white veil and an enormous bouquet
and yards of satin train that i can
scarcely drag after me but i want to
drag it up the aisle to mendelssohn
and back to lohengrin oh no i
dont want any impromptu justice-of-
the-peace performance-and i dont be-
lieve you do either why did you say
that ed

  oh only because i thought it would
save you further molestations from that
very objectionable count but the
young mans manner and expression
were not entirely ingenuous he did
his hand and seal



not meet his fiancees direct gaze but
shifted his glance uneasily about the
room

  oh he doesnt molest me isabel
declared its really mother and grace
who do the molesting

  well marry me and even they
shant molest you any more isabel
cant you fix up your white satin and
your lohengrin soon i dont want to
wait long darling

  the girl looked at him the words
were exactly those of a fond lover to
his promised bride and yet she missed
something from the tone that she felt
sure ought to have been there and
again there was his wandering glance
surely an eager bridegroom would look
straight into the eyes of the girl he
loved with a look that would say even
more than his words

  but she responded lightly non-
sense boy we cant be married before
spring of course i had thought of
june but if youre so insistent ill think
about april  not may-thats un-
lucky

  oh isabel do make it sooner than
april thats ages away

  indeed i wont and i think more
likely it will be june what has made
you so impatient all at once and ive
a lot to do before i think about getting
married i have to take over my for-
tune from guardy weatherby and i
have to learn to be a business woman
and keep a bank account and manage
my stocks and bonds and invest my
surplus income im not going to man-
age my affairs that silly womanish way
everybody makes game of im going
to learn real business ways and i shall
take care of my estate as well as any
man could mr weatherby will teach
me ive already asked him to and
he has promised

  i should think isabel that a mar-
ried woman would expect her husband
to manage her financial affairs

  thats just where you make a mis-

take edwin mine that sort of thing
was in vogue i believe some years ago
but the woman of to-day if she has
any money looks after it herself so
lets consider that settled before we go
any farther

  but i dont like the way youve
settled it i really think dear that
youre acting in too independent a
manner

  i am independent ed and you
know it you have always known it
and im glad we understand each other
im of age now and guardy is going
to give over my estate to me at once
he is going to teach me to take care
of it and as i expect to learn rapidly
that wont take long and then after
that ill promise you that i will begin
at once to make preparations for our
wedding

  it doesnt become me isabel to ob-
ject to your plans but you know how
i detest strong-minded women i hope
you will at least turn to me for ad-
vice and assistance when you need it
when i need it ed i will

  a short silence followed which be-
gan to be a trifle embarrassing and
then isabel spoke lightly of other sub-
jects and the question of her financial
affairs was not again referred to

  when they left the restaurant stuart
said which way are you going shall
we walk for a few blocks

  yes im going up fifth avenue
to madame laurestines and ill ask
her what she thinks of an april wed-
ding really shes the most important
personage to be considered in the mat-
ter

 how absurd you are why do
brides think they want such a lot of
toggery

  and why do bridegrooms always
voice that very sentiment no matter
how they express it

  stuart laughed he was a handsome
young fellow a fair type of new yorks
society man courteous  well-man-


detective story magazine

nered and alert but with an easy-going
effect which was in strong contrast to
isabels decision of character

  well of course you want me to be
a conventional bridegroom otherwise
youd marry that erratic and uncertain
count so come along my lady and
ill take you up to your modistes and
then im going to the club but i say
isabel m shy for the moment could
you let me have a little money for a
few days

  why of course ned with pleasure
how much do you want

  about five hundred dollars girlie
if you have it by you

  isabels curved red lips set themselves
in a straight line ned she said in
a firm voice are you going to gamble
with it

  stuart looked at her disapprovingly
as if to rebuke her bad taste

  isabel you shouldnt say things like
that in the first place gamble is not
a word to be used among people of
our set and too a young girl like you
shouldnt mention such a thing

  isabel looked him straight in the eyes
if im going to marry you she said
slowly there is no subject that i may
not mention to you especially one so
closely connected with your own repu-
tation

  what do you mean 

  just what i say i am told there
are rumors of your gambling and when
you ask me for money im naturally
interested to know if it is for that pur-
pose

  your interest seems to me more like
curiosity no i take that back dont
let us quarrel of course the money
isnt for any such purpose so let me
have it dearie wont you 

  i havent that much with me ned
and i dont want to give you such a
large sum anyway but i have to go
to the bank to cash a check and if you
like well go there first and ill give
you a hundred wont that do ned

  no that wont do little one i hope
you can make it a trifle more than that
lets take a taxicab to the bank
very well said isabel

chapter ii

the dark hour

it was almost half past six that same
evening when mrs curwood and
grace returned to their apartment in
the ponsonby

   there was a telephone message
maam said a maid appearing in the
doorway mr stuart maam tele-
phoned that miss isabel would go with
him to tea

  very well jane did he say what
time she would be home

  no maam nothing about that
shell be in soon said grace i
think she was rather clever to go to
tea with ed instead of that place we
went to now run along to your room
motherie and get a little rest so youll
look your best this evening itll be
rather a gorgeous dinner you know
it was nearly a half hour later when
grace curwood who was lounging on
a couch in her own boudoir glanced
at her clock and concluded it was time
she began to dress she pushed the
button of an electric bell and in a few
minutes her maid appeared

  ill wear that blue-and-silver ar-
rangement to-night she began sitting
up on the couch and untying the ribbons
of her pretty negligee gown

  but as she rose she fell back again
to the couch with a startled exclama-
tion for the room had gone suddenly
dark there was not a glimmer of
light and by sudden contrast it was the
very blackness of darkness

  good gracious marie what has hap-
pened something wrong with the
electrics of course theyll flash on
again in a minute

  yes miss grace came maries
voice through the darkness just stay
his hand and seal



still till they light up or you may fall
over a chair and hurt yourself

  oh ill stay still laughed grace
cuddling back among the pillows the
longer the lights stay out the better
ill like it for it gives me a few mo-
ments more rest i wonder if mother
is frightened cant you grope your
way to her marie and tell her to keep
still until the lights are right again
marie went away obediently and
grace could hear her fumbling her way
to mrs curwoods room

  but even after marie had made her
way back again the whole place was
still in total darkness

  your mothers all right miss
grace said the maid she has a lit-
tle lamp that she has lighted and shes
going on with her toilet she says
havent you a candle or something
no ive no candle and no electric
lamp but if this darkness keeps up
theyll send us some sort of lights from
the office im sure at any rate i
cant go on dressing until i have a light
of some kind

  grace made her way to the window
and looked out the whole near-by
portion of the city was dark its a
district she said i think the electric
light is all portioned out in districts
and if anything goes wrong the whole
section is affected but i never knew
this sort of thing to last so long be-
fore

  marie went away on a search for
lights of some sort and when she re-
turned bringing candles she said its
a bad lookout miss grace the janitor
sent a boy up with these candles and
though i didnt get all the right of it
its a short circuit or something like
that and the whole house is pitch dark
and not only that but the electric ele-
vators wont work he says the light
and power are both cut off

  oh well marie we must make the
best of it you can do my hair by
candlelight youre such a clever girl

im sure you can and then by the
time i have to get into that blue gown
we shall probably have the lights again
lets hope so anyway

  but by the time that miss curwoods
beautiful hair had been drawn into the
fashionable shape that was decreed that
winter light had not yet been restored
grace had telephoned to the office but
had received only a corroboration of
maries account more candles had
been sent up and the apartment was
now fairly well lighted though out of
doors it was still dark

  grace went to her mothers room
shall we go to the dinner she said
well have to walk down eight flights
of stairs here and up a lot more at
mrs merwins the electric elevators
are out of commission you know can-
dles will be all right on the dinner table
but i hate to ride through the dark
streets dont you

   i dont care anything about the din-
ner grace-whether we go or not but
im worried about isabel where do
you suppose she is 

  oh shes all right shes with ed
stuart you know and of course hell
look after her they probably went to
the ritz for tea

  yes but they would have left there
long ago i hope theyre not lost in
the darkness

   well theyd be in a taxicab and by
the lights on the cab the driver could
find his way here of course

  yes thats just what worries me
they ought to have been here long ago
its almost eight oclock what can we
do i wish youd call ed on the tele-
phone

  what good would that do for i
know i could not get him he must
be with isabel wherever they are

  as they were talking the electric
lights flashed on once more and the
whole place was as light as usual
thank goodness for that cried


detective story magazine

grace but it must have been a bad
accident to put out the lights so long
now well have to fly round to get to
the dinner in time though of course
tardiness is excusable in a case like
this

  mrs curwood and grace returned
from the dinner at half past eleven only
to learn that isabel had not yet come
home

  has she telephoned asked mrs
curwood of jane the parlor maid

  no maam there has been no mes-
sage

  its the craziest thing i ever heard
of declared grace isabel is wild
about ed but she ought to know better
than to stay out with him as late as
this do you suppose they are dining
somewhere 

  i dont know theyve no business
to be dining alone together anyway
and if it was brought about by that
electrical accident they surely ought to
be home by this time im very much
annoyed ive always let isabel do as
she chose but she never before did
anything that i could criticize i dont
know what to do about it

  i dont see as you can do anything
mother we could telephone to ed
again but i know we wouldnt find him
at his home or his club so whats the
use you dont think theyve eloped
do you

  no of course not isabel cares too
much for a showy wedding to do any-
thing like that

  well perhaps theyve gone to a the-
ater

  thats the only plausible thing to
think of but isabel isnt dressed for
the theater and too she would have
telephoned if they had done that they
may have gone somewhere to call and
been persuaded to stay late

  well we cant do anything so we
may as well go to bed of course isa-
bel is all right since shes with ed and

when she does come home shell give
a satisfactory explanation i know
yes of course she will jane will
have to sit up for her im glad the
lights came up again somehow i feel
sure it was because of that accident
that they stayed away to dinner
well dont bother about it go right
to bed my pretty little mother and to-
morrow morning i shall scold isabel
roundly for the anxiety she has caused
you

  not long after twelve oclock the
curwoods apartment was dark save
for its night lights and both grace and
her mother slept quietly without dream-
ing of the missing isabel jane occu-
pying an easy-chair in the hall waited
up for the late coiner but as the hours
went by and janes vigil was unbroken
sleep overcame her and at last her
head sank on her breast and she too
slept

chapter iii

where is isabel

it was a little more than half past six
the next morning when grace cur-
wood was awakened by the murmur
of voices her drowsy eyes opened
slowly and then stared at the unusual
spectacle of three women gathered at
her bedside

  they were jane marie ad ellen
the cook and all three white faces
looked scared and awe-struck

  marie spoke first oh miss grace
she said miss isabel hasnt come
home

  grace laughed well i dont sup-
pose the world will come to an end if
she hasnt she must have spent the
night at some friends house

  oh do you think so exclaimed
marie in great relief

  of course i think so where else
could she be and did you wake me
up at this unearthly hour to tell me
this go away all of you and let me
finish my sleep
his hand and seal



  it was a couple of hours later when
mrs curwood wakened and marie
bringing her morning tea told her the
news she didnt take it as calmly as
grace had rising at once she slipped
on a kimono and hurried to her daugh-
ters room

  grace she said where is isabel 
goodness mother i dont know i
havent hidden her

  but she didnt come home

  then she must have stayed out
probably she stayed overnight at ade-
laide piersons

  oh grace if she had done that
she would have telephoned us

  i should think so but perhaps the
telephones went out of order when the
lights went out last night

  but we telephoned

  only in the house perhaps the dis-
trict was affected i dont know what
a district is but its always affected if
anything goes wrong with the electric-
ity

  grace do be serious im sure
something dreadful has happened to is-
abel

  well nothing could happen except
that she has eloped with ed stuart
and that isnt so very dreadful for
she was bound to marry him anyway
mrs curwood sighed i wish she
would give him up ljes undesirable in
every way and im almost certain
count kovroff is interested lh isabel
interested i should say he was
but she wont look at him sh sees
nobody but ed stuart run along
mother and get dressed isabel will
turn up all right of course she hasnt
really eloped and youll hear from her
soon

 mrs curwood went back to her
room but graces prophecy was not ful-
filled when ten oclock came and no
sign of the girl even grace began to
feel anxious

  i think ill telephone ed stuart

she said and hell tell us where she
went last night after he left her
will he be at his office yet 

  i think so if not ill call him up
at his rooms

  grace succeeded in getting stuart on
the telephone but as she talked with
him her face assumed a bewildered ex-
pression

  i cant understand it she said go-
ing back to her mother ed says he
left isabel yesterday afternoon at ma-
dame laurestines and he hasnt seen
her since

  what exclaimed mrs curwood
now dont get excited mother its
all right im sure isabel spent most
of the afternoon trying on gowns and
then she went to adelaides or some-
where and stayed there all night at
any rate she hasnt eloped with ed
but grace mr stuart telephoned
you know that he was taking isabel to
tea jane said so

  why so she did i had forgotten
that mother there is something queer
about it all im going to telephone mr
stuart again

  after her second conversation with
the young man grace was more mys-
tified than ever

  he says that he didnt take isabel
to tea and that he didnt telephone up
here at all but hes coming up here
himself right away he seems to think
theres something wrong

  something wrong i should say
there was if he didnt telephone who
did

  i dont know im sure ill ask
jane about it

  but jane when summoned and ques-
tioned could only repeat the message
that had been given her

  it was a gentlemans  voice miss
grace and he said tell mrs cur-
wood that miss isabel is going to tea
with me and i said who is this
please and he said mr stuart
and then he shut off quick like


detective story magazine

  are you sure it was mr stuarts
voice asked grace

  im not sure miss grace i couldnt
tell his voice over the telephone but
thats what he said

  of course it wasnt ed stuarts
voice if he says he didnt telephone
yesterday said mrs curwood its
all very strange grace

  it is indeed mother perhaps she
has eloped with count kovroff

  if thats the case ill forgive her
gladly but that isnt it grace some
accident has happened to isabel

  oh pshaw mother dont lets
think that until we have to im sure
isabels all right but i cant understand
that telephone message

  im sure it was ed stuart that tele-
phoned though who else could it be
and this morning for some reason he
sees fit to deny it hes a rogue grace
and i wouldnt trust him as far as i
could see him

  well youll see him soon mother
and as we cant do anything in the
meantime lets stop worrying about it
grace went away to her own pursuits
but the mothers anxiety was not so
easily allayed mrs curwood was a
frivolous-minded matron and often
thought more about her own gayeties
and entertainments than about her
daughters welfare but this state of
things was largely because her daugh-
ters welfare had always been seemingly
assured now that there was a pos-
sibility that something untoward had
happened mrs curwood was as much
troubled and alarmed as if she had
been a mother of the brooding and hov-
ering type	

  after what seemed to her an in-
terminable wait stuart arrived

  he came in with his usual debonair
manner and a quizzical smile played
on his handsome face as he said
whats all this about my taking isabel
to tea i did ask her but she refused
my further hospitality we had lunch

together you know and i think she
felt she had seen enough of me for
one day

  but where did she go after she left
you  asked mrs curwood eagerly

  why i left her at madame laures-
tines she said she was going to be
there most of the afternoon looking at
some of that ladys newest importa-
tions

  yes said mrs curwood thought-
fully  she didnt have a fitting engage-
ment she just went there to look at
some models but where did she go
after that

  i dont know im sure i offered
to come back for her and take her to
tea but she said no she wanted to go
home early as she was dining out
then she did intend to go to thfe
merwins dinner after all exclaimed
grace but she seemed to cut out
the malcolm tea

  but where is she urged mrs cur-
wood mr stuart something must
have happened to her

  this is the funny part said grace
we were out at a tea mother and i
and when we came home jane said that
you had telephoned that you were tak-
ing isabel to tea

  why i didnt do any such thing
declared stuart i didnt see isabel
after three oclock and ive no idea
where she went i didnt telephone
your maid must have mistaken the
name

  that must be it agreed grace
she said she didnt recognize your
voice but then one wouldnt expect
her- to and she said shes sure that the
gentleman said he was mr stuart
what other name sounds like stu-
art inquired the young man thought-
fully and then he added with a smile
kovroff doesnt

  thats the worst of it said grace
smiling too if it had been count
kovroff mother wouldnt mind a bit
his hand and seal



in fact shes hoping that isabel has
eloped with him

  you make a mistake mrs cur-
wood said stuart gravely count
kovroff is a new man among us and
im by no means sure that his creden-
tials are unimpeachable

  thats what isabel says declared
grace and i know shed never run
away with him she hates him i think
she just went to stay overnight with
oneof the girls and she never dreamed
wed be anxious about her

  well i think there is some cause for
anxiety why dont you telephone to
some of her friends

  oh if you and mother are both go-
ing to be anxious ill have to do that to
prove my case ill call up adelaide
first

  for the better part of an hour grace
was at the telephone after calling up
various houses where isabel might be
she called up unlikely ones but all with
the same result no one seemed to
have seen or heard of isabel curwood
the afternoon before and now grace
herself was not only as anxious as
the other two but even more so

  something has happened she de-
clared as she hung up the receiver after
her last futile call something dread-
ful has happened to isabel what shall
we do mr stuart how can we find
her

  oh well find her i cant think
anything dreadful has happened but
its mighty queer about the telephone
message i cant think why any one
should have used my name

  what time did you leave isabel yes-
terday at the dressmakers  asked
mrs curwood

  it was just about three a trifle after
perhaps

  did you go right there from
luncheon 

  yes replied stuart but he spoke
after an instants hesitation

  did isabel seem in good spirits
asked grace

  oh yes of course dont talk as
if you thought she went off to drown
herself and how could a girl be other
than in good spirits when she was go-
ing to look at paris gowns and i
may as well tell you mrs curwood
that we discussed the date of our wed-
ding day i persuaded her to consider
april as a good time to get married
mrs curwood looked displeased
you know mr stuart she said i
have never given my consent to your
engagement to isabel though nowa-
days a parents consent is not consid-
ered necessary i believe

  you believe quite right said young
stuatt gayly so long as you dont
put any definite obstacle in our way
we consider ourselves engaged by
jove i wish i had eloped with her
yesterday and then wed know where
she is now but mrs curwood theres
no use blinking the fact that something
must have happened i confess im
alarmed and i think we should set to
work at once to find out where she is
but what can we do asked the
mother helplessly

  the first thing to do said grace
decidedly is to send for mr weath-
erby if the matter is serious which i
cant think it is hes the one to con-
sult

  send for him grace said her
mother and meantime ill go and lie
down i feel faint

  now dont do the despairing act
mother isabels all right and youll
find that mr weatherby will take a
sensible view of it

  leonard weatherby arrived shortly
and was soon in possession of the facts
of isabels disappearance mr weath-
erby was a capable-looking man and
seemed the very one to whom to turn
in a disagreeable predicament

  he was of the large type often de-
scribed as portly and his face wore


detective story magazine

the imperturbable expression of a man
of the world his black hair was gray
at the temples and his large dark eyes
and olive complexion gave him some-
what the look of an actor there was
decision of character shown in his
strong square chin and on the whole
leonard weatherby was a man whom
the most casual observer would recog-
nize as a power and a strength

  and indeed he seemed so to the
curwood ladies and both they and
young stuart felt a sense of confidence
in his presence

  of course the girls all right he
said in his hearty way im quite sure
she hasnt been abducted and i trust
no accident has happened but we must
do all we can to find her you say you
telephoned to all her girl friends
yes replied grace even to those
houses where i am positive she never
would have gone

 then went on mr weatherby
gently i cant think of anything else
but to telephone the hospitals now
dont faint he added as mrs cur-
wood turned white you know in
case of even a slight accident if isabel
had been alone she might have been
taken to a hospital

  but in that case they would have
telephoned us  cried grace

  yes-that is unless-

  you mean unless she were uncon-
scious oh mr weatherby how can
you make such dreadful suggestions
and grace clapped her hands over her
ears

  i didnt grace you suggested it
yourself but surely it can do no harm
to inquire at the hospitals for if she
isnt there youll certainly feel re-
lieved

 thats true enoughand again
grace went to the telephone

  but a round-up of the hospitals
brought no news of isabel curwood

  just as i expected exclaimed
grace as she returned to the group

of course im glad isabel isnt in the
hospitals but i wish i knew where she
is what shall we do next mr weath-
erby 

   i dont see that you can do anything
except wait for her to come home
there are dozens of things that might
have happened perhaps she met some
friend who took her motoring and the
 car broke down a long distance from
anywhere it might easily happen that
they couldnt telephone and perhaps
they stayed at some farmhouse over-
night or even camped out under the
stars

  why of course thats it declared
mrs curwood her volatile nature re-
sponding to this happy thought why
didnt we think of that before mr
weatherby youre a great comfort
im sure your supposition is right
well well see and in the mean-
time theres nothing to do but wait

   i dont agree with you said grace
in her straightforward way if shed
been in a motor accident and wasnt
killed isabel would have let us know
somehow before this

  oh probably not an accident put
in mr weatherby just a burst tire
or some delay of that sort dont take
it so seriously grace

  i didnt at first returned grace
but now i feel sure that it is serious
there is no rational or explainable place
that isabel could be from which she
couldnt have sent us word and i
know what im going to do im going
to send for mr britton

  yes let us do so said mr weath-
erby though i dont know what he
could do more than we can

  i dont know either but hes our
lawyer and when anything like this
happens he ought to be called in

   i think so too said mrs curwood
of course mr weatherby you and
mr stuart and grace and i are all
deeply concerned for isabels welfare
but perhaps the very depth of our feel-
his hand and seal



tng makes us less capable of rational
action than an outsider mr britton is
cool-headed and clear-headed and as
our family lawyer i think he should be
consulted

  t agree with you mrs curwood
mr weatherby said for i now begin
to fear that it is a serious matter al-
though of course isabel may come in
at any moment

  well theres no harm done if she
does said grace jumping up and go-
ing once more to the telephone im
going to call mr britton anyway
tell him what has happened said
her mother  and then he can come
here or not as he sees fit

  after graces conversation with the
lawyer she came slowly back to her
former seat with a white scared face

  hes very much alarmed she said
and hes coming right up here he
wants mr weatherby and mr stuart
to stay until he comes

  of course well stay declared
weatherby if britton thinks the
matter serious it may be so hes a
fair-minded man as i recall him i
dont know him very well

  i dont know him at all said stu-
art but if he can find isabel for us
hes a good fellow

  but james britton was about the last
man in the world to whom one would
apply the term a good fellow in its
usually accepted significance small of
stature sharp-featured alert and ener-
getic his whole make-up betokened a
hard-headed lawyer of an ascetic tem-
perament he was a little given how-
ever to bustle and fluster and he en-
tered mrs curwood library with a
quick nervous stepand delivered him-
self of hasty flurried greetings

  what-whats all this about isa-
bel gone disappeared who saw her
last

  so far as we four know i did
replied stuart and then he told the
lawyer of his parting with isabel at

the door of the fashionable modistes
the afternoon before

  did she say how long she would
remain there asked mr britton con-
cisely

  she said she would be there some
time and afterward would go directly
home but she didnt say this definitely
and if she met any friends at the dress-
makers or afterward she might easily
have gone somewhere with them
never mind what she might have
done the lawyer flung out the
question is what she did do

  that i cant tell you replied stu-
art a trifle annoyed at the lawyers
brusque manner

  then we must find out some other
way youre the last person that we
know to have seen her mr stuart but
we assume that the next one was this
dressmaker you tell of let us tele-
phone her at once

  what a sensible idea cried grace
i felt sure mr britton youd know
what to do ill call her

  but after grace had succeeded in
getting madame laurestine on the wire
and had talked with her a moment she
turned and asked mr britton to speak
to her

  the fussy little lawyer flew to the
telephone and his short crisp sentences
brought consternation to the anxious
four who were listening to him

  not at all are you sure yes-
terday-yesterday afternoon please
be very certain it is most important
thank you that is all

  he turned from the telephone and
announced curtly isabel was not at
madame laurestines at all yesterday
afternoon

  this speech was received with utter
silence on the part of his auditors for
each of the four was dumfounded ed-
win stuart turned perfectly white and
mr weatherby looked at him curiously
his dark eyes narrowing and his square
chin setting itself firmly


detective story magazine

  mrs curwood looked both stunned
and bewildered and it was grace who
first found voice to exclaim

  then what do you mean ed stuart
by saying that you left her there
but i did half stammered the
young man and still leonard weath-
erbys dark eyes gazed at him with a
look of unbelief

chapter iv

the apartment in the
hammersmith

a well-dressed and quiet-look-
ing lady walked slowly along one
of the streets among the upper forties
she had been on several other streets
in her endeavor to find an apartment
that combined all the especial advan-
tages she desired but never did she
stray very far from fifth avenue

  she paused in front of a carved stone
entrance and taking in the general
effect of the house at a glance she gave
an approving little nod the doors
opened at her approach and she said
to the hallboy is this the hammer-
smith 

yes madam responded that rather
ornate personage in conventional tones

  i wish to see the janitor please
call him

  yes madam and in a fairly rea-
sonable time the janitor of the ham-
mersmith appeared

  you have a vacant apartment i
believe asked mrs dellenbaugh in
the businesslike manner of one who has
interviewed many janitors regarding
vacant apartments

  y-yes maam and mrs dellen-
baugh stared slightly at the unusual
spectacle of a janitor who was defer-
ential instead of pompous

  very well i wish to see it

  yes certainly-of course this
way madam

  as the elevator rose mrs dellen-
baugh concluded she had been mistaken

in the janitors mental attitude for as
she looked at him longer she observed
that he bore himself rather with an air
of swaggering bravado

  but mrs dellenbaugh was an experi-
enced house hunter and accustomed to
all sorts of apartments and all types
of attendants who showed them off

  the elevator stopped at the third
floor and the janitor preceded mrs
dellenbaugh to the entrance of the va-
cant apartment the door was not
locked and he threw it open with a
flourish

  very attractive liall mrs dellen-
baugh murmured as her quick eyes took
instant note of the white doric columns
and elaborate doorframes together
they went through several rooms the
lady commenting on details that pleased
her and the janitor mumbling agree-
ment with her opinions

  at the entrance of one of the bed-
rooms the man stepped aside to let
mrs dellenbaugh precede him when
she gave a gasp and fell back almost
into his arms

  whats the matter maam he said
hastily as she put both hands over her
eyes and seemed about to faint dont
scream he added as after looking
into the room himself he led the trem-
bling lady from the door

  im not going to scream she said
and though her voice was faint she
was evidently regaining her composure
by sheer force of will im not the
screaming sort but-but theres a dead
woman in there

  though still trembling she was
standing now without the mans sup-
port and perhaps of the two he was
the more shaken

  maybe she isnt dead maam he
whispered as he cast furtive glances
toward the door but made no move to
enter

  oh she is im sure she is but
if she shouldnt be we must go to her
assistance go ahead and ill follow
his hand and seal



  oh please dont make me go in
there maam i-im awful sensitive
about such things let us go down-
stairs and send for somebody maam
coward what sort of a man are
you youre in charge of this place
and its your duty to investigate this
thing come if you wont go first i
will we must see what is the matter
with that poor woman

  mrs dellenbaugh stepped across the
threshold and as she approached the
quiet figure lying on the floor her look
of horror turned to one of compassion

  the poor girl she exclaimed
what can have happened to her
what is your name man

  taylor maam

  well taylor dont stand there like
a trembling idiot  this is an awful
emergency now do your part like a
man this young woman is beautiful
and well to do she must have come
here because she wanted to end her life
or it may have been death from illness
are you-are you sure shes dead
maam 

  of course she is shes stone-cold
but it isnt our business to say so in
fact we oughtnt even to touch her
you must send for a doctor at once
oh havent you any sense at all dont
stand there looking perfectly blank go
at once and telephone for some doctor
do you know of any

  i-i think maam it will be better
to call the policc first i think thats
what we ought to do

  well im glad youve waked up to
the fact that we ought to do something
i expect youre right go and call the
police then and go at once

  and leave you alone with-with
that maam

  yes im not afraid of course i
was shocked at first but im not one
of those foolish women who lose their
wits in an emergency cant you tele-
phone directly from this apartment
without going downstairs

 yes ill tell the hallboy maam to
step out and bring in the policeman on
this beat then he can telephone head-
quarters himself

   taylor went back to the telephone
which was in the hall and mrs dellen-
baugh immediately proved that her fem-
inine trait of curiosity was stronger
than her equally feminine attribute of
nerves

  with no effects of fear or horror
she scrutinized the appearance and be-
longings of the dead girl she noted
the quiet elegance of her tailored cos-
tume the beautiful fashion of her
french hat and the exquisite correct-
ness of all the minor details of her ap-
parel with a swift glance at the door
she hurriedly opened the girls wrist
bag and glanced over the contents she
even drew out a visiting card and looked
at it replacing it just in time to escape
the notice of the returning janitor

   ive sent for the policeman maam
and hell be here soon

  very well have you any idea
taylor who this can be

   no maam indeed i havent

   it isnt any one then that lived in
this house

  no i never saw the lady before
did you

   at this sudden question mrs dellen-
baugh looked a little embarrassed no
i never did she replied but one can
see at a glance that she was refined and
well bred its very mysterious

  the hallboy came in followed by a
tall policeman both men were very
white and shuddered at the sight they
faced indeed it seemed strange that
mrs dellenbaugh should show com-
posure and even curiosity when all of
the men present were nervously shaken

  you henry you go back to the
door said the janitor gruffly theres
no call for you to stay here and i
say officer you dont need me do you
let the hallboy go taylor but you
stay here and answer a few questions


detective story magazine

you cant have a dead girl found in
your house and walk off without a
word where did she come from and
who killed her

  oh she hasnt been killed has she
exclaimed mrs dellenbaugh

  yes maam she has and may i ask
who are you

  im mrs roger dellenbaugh and i
came here to look at this apartment
with a view to renting it the janitor
brought me up to show me the rooms
and here we found this girl

  the policeman looked at her in ad-
miration mighty few ladies can tell
a story so brieflike and to the point
he commented perhaps you had bet-
ter stay maam until i can phone the
station house and they get the coroner
here but ill guarantee that he wont
keep you long if thats all you know
about this case

  thats all and im quite willing to
stay until the coroner comes i know
nothing of the case as you call it but
i might be able to assist in some way
shall you send for the poor girls
friends 

  the officer gave her a swift glance
how can we maam when we dont
know who she is  do you know 
how could i know evaded mrs
dellenbaugh i never saw her before
of that im sure

  at that the policeman seemed to lose
all interest in mrs dellenbaughs pres-
ence and devoted his attention to tele-
phoning

  its going to be a big case he re-
marked bigger than anything thats
happened around here for a long time
you can go downstairs if you like tay-
lor but dont leave the house

  in rather a shorter time than mrg
dellenbaugh had dared to hope the cor-
oner arrived and almost simultaneously
inspector fox appeared

  it did not take the coroner long to
learn such facts as were evident and
after examination of the body he an-

nounced briefly the poor lady was
strangled-choked to death-by some
brute how could it have happened
in this house are any of the other
apartments vacant

  no answered taylor all the
others are occupied

  heres her name and address said
coroner hills opening the wrist bag
that mrs dellenbaugh had already in-
vestigated at least we have reason
to suppose that the card in this little
cardcase is hers

  who is she asked the inspector
and hills read miss curwood the
ponsonby

 thats up on seventy-second
street said inspector fox better
telephone up to her people

  oh dont do anything like that
exclaimed mrs dellenbaugh think
how it would shock them

  the inspector looked at her curiously
what would you suggest he in-
quired with just a trace of irony in his
tone

  there must be some other way
she said looking thoughtful why
dont you call up say the superintend-
ent of the ponsonby and ask him
something about her

  inspector foxs manner changed
thats right he said women al-
ways have more tact than men its
an awful business anyway

  and that was how it happened that
mr merritt superintendent of the pon-
sonby apartment house presented him-
self to the little group assembled in
mrs curwoods drawing-room just as
they were discussing the advisability of
asking police aid to search for the miss-
ing isabel

  not at all liking the duty he had to
perform mr merritt stood looking
from mrs curwood to her lawyer and
back again  mr weatherby and ed
stuart were there also as they had been
most of the day but as usual it was
grace who took the initiative
his hand and seal



  youve heard something from isa-
bel i know you have she exclaimed
and as mr merritt bowed his head in
grave assent she went on something
dreadful has happened to her i know
it has you may as well tell us at
once what it is

  wait a moment cried mr weath-
erby springing to mrs curwoods side
if youve anything unpleasant to tell
tell me or britton first

  yes indeed said the lawyer as
jumping up he took mr merritt by
the arm and drew him into the next
room

  grace too ran to her mothers assist-
ance and ed stuart followed for at
the first appearance of mr merritt
mrs curwood had felt forebodings of
trouble and at graces words about isa-
bel she had given a low moan and
fainted away

  stuart rang for marie and as she ap-
peared with jane also mrs curwood
was left to their care and graces while
the men gathered in the other room to
hear mr merritts story

  he told them that an inspector had
telephoned him from the hammersmith
and that there was reason to believe
the dead girl found there was isabel
curwood also the inspector requested
that some one come down there imme-
diately to identify the body

  the three men listening were aghast
at this statement and lawyer britton
spoke first

  it may not be isabel you know
after all so dont tell the whole story
to mrs curwood and grace until we
are certain i suggest that mr stuart
stay here with them and mr weath-
erby and i will go down to the place
at once and see for ourselves mr

weatherby is isabels guardian-

  but i am more closely related to
isabel than that broke in edwin stu-
art impetuously let me go with you
mr britton and let mr weatherby
stay with the ladies

  a ds

  as you like responded the lawyer
what do you say weatherby
whatever you think best britton
if stuart prefers to go with you i will
stay in charge of things here let us
hope there is some mistake ifi the mes-
sage mr merritt received

  there must be cried stuart it

cant be that our isabel is-

  of course the inspector told me
but the merest facts said mr mer-
rittt and he said they based their
knowledge of the girls identity on a
card found in her cardcase

  but sometimes ladies have other
ladies cards with them suggested
stuart

  so they do my boy said mr brit-
ton kindly come with me then and
we will go at once well telephone
back weatherby whatever we may find
out

  telephone to mr merritt then
dont stir up this apartment-that is
unless you have good news for us and
im afraid mrs curwood is pretty ill
perhaps wed better send for a doctor
for her

  no said grace coming into the
room mothers quite herself now
mr merritt tell me what this is about
my sister tell me the worst at once
it is my right to know

  were not sure there is any worst
grace said mr weatherby there
has been an accident to a young woman
and while it may be isabel yet it may
not dont worry my dear until you
are sure you have cause to

  the other three men had already left
the apartment and as mr weatherby
would tell her nothing further of the
report that had been received grace
was forced to control her anxiety as
best she could mr weatherby ad-
vised her very sensibly to do all she
could to lessen her mothers fears and
this had the effect of lightening in a
measure her own terrible anxiety


detective story magazine

  meantime the two men in a taxi-
cab were hastening to their destination

  the hallboy at the hammersmith di-
rected them and soon they stood in the
presence of the lifeless remains of isa-
bel curwood

  there is no doubt about it said
mr britton as after the briefest of
glances he turned away

  doubt no indeed declared stu-
art as he stood gazing at the beautiful
white face what can it mean mr
britton who could have done it
are you sure it is murder asked
the lawyer of inspector fox

  sure yes sir the girl was stran-
gled and the marks on her neck show
it but the coroner says she must be
taken to bellevue for an autopsy
edwin stuart shuddered at the awful
suggestion but mr britton said yes
that must be done for of course we
must discover who killed her it seems
incredible that any one could have done
so that beautiful young girl

  but before the body is removed

sir said mr hills we will have an
inquest

  is that necessary asked mr brit-
ton

  i think it would be better to do so
in this case it probably wont take
long sixll be enough for a jury
taylor you can round up that many in
the house cant you

  probably yes sir

  then go ahead get six men and
bring them in here as soon as you can
the janitor went away leaving stu-
art and britton aghast at the business-
like way in which the affair was carried-
on but the bare fact of isabels death
was so appalling that the minor details
of procedure seemed insignificant in
comparison

  in accordance with his promise mr
britton telephoned to the superintendent
of the ponsonby and told him that the
dead girl was isabel beyond all doubt
and that he must tell mr weatherby
who would break the news to the cur-
wood ladies

why radium is so valuable

jne-sixth of the worlds output of radium is made within seven miles of
philadelphia in a factory at lansdowne which is one of six plants of
its kind in the world it has a capacity for producing three grams of radium a
year the process by which the metal is made was discovered by doctor d h
kabakjian assistant professor of physics in the university of pennsylvania and
a resident of lansdowne

    some idea of the delicacy of the secret chemical processes which the carno-
tite ore undergoes can be gleaned from the output of the factory hundreds
of tons of carnotite are used during the course of a year twenty-five men
working nine hours a day for a year will produce three grams of pure radium
salt the market price of pure radium is one hundred thousand dollars a gram
at this time and the lansdowne factorys yearly output is worth three hundred
thousand dollars a gram is one-twenty-eighth of an ounce

    radium is sent to all parts of the world from the factory in lansdowne
we have to be mighty careful how we ship this material said doctor

penny nail
i had been installed as curate at
cowleton only about six months
when after a long days tramp
over the moors where i had been
visiting the parishioners i returned to
my lodgings to find awaiting me a tele-
gram from my old friend demers who
was still on the staff of the morning
call the message read

  come at once interesting case on hand

demers

 it was monday evening and i was
free for the week so i scribbled a note
to the vicar replaced my clericals with
a tweed suit took my automatic pistol
-the one presented to me after the so-
lution of the silver bullet case-and
made for the station

  demers short fat jolly and busy
as ever met me at waterloo and we
took a cab to mount joy hill where he
and i had roomed together for nearly
three years it was late and demers
was on an important assignment for
the morning issue so he soon left me
and i turned in

 the next morning at breakfast
demers gave me an outline of his in-
teresting case and i found that even
his enthusiasm did not overestimate the
interest of it we had been boyhood
chums we had lived together in lon-
don after demers by his wonderful
work in distancing scotland yard in
the solution of the explosive pearl
case had secured his present place on
the call and we had traced together the
intricacies of crime in a number of
causcs celcbrcs but none had more

mysterious features than the one which
had now been assigned to him to un-
ravel

  thats all we have to go on so far
but mr ivors is coming at ten and
he will tell you the whole thing and
then you will understand it better
as he spoke the bell rang and we
heard mrs gammie letting in a visitor
we went across the hall to the room
which demers had fitted up as a chem-
ical laboratory and it was there that
i first saw mr harrison ivors dem-
ers removed a box of test tubes from
the only chair and begged his visitor
to be seated i found a place on a
trunk and demers perched on the edge
of the sink mr ivors was a man of
about forty-five tall and distinguished
in appearance naturally of a nervous
temperament now accentuated by the
evident strain under which he was la-
boring but with such self-command
that he was able to tell his story with a
straightforward simplicity his quiet
voice and manner showed him to be a
person of culture and he gave evidence
of being a man of very strong will

 two years ago he began my
eldest son gerald was found dead on
the morning of his fifteenth birthday
the night before he had gone to a
party given by a cousin in honor of
the event and his mother and i sup-
posed he had decided to stay all night
we found afterward that he had made
some excuse to leave his cousins house
before midnight in the morning his
body was found lying at the foot of an


detective story magazine

oak tree in my grounds clothed in a
womans silk dressing gown tied about
the waist with a piece of greenish-yel-
low whipcord there was absolutely
no sign of a wound or of poison and
he lay quietly as though asleep we
never learned how or why he died

  yesterday morning the tragedy was
repeated in the person of my youngest
son jack and again it was on the
morning of his birthday i had become
acquainted with the great success mr
demers has had in solving such prob-
lems and i have put the case in his
hands i implore you and your friend
if he will be so good to help me and
bring to justice if there be such a thing
as justice for such diabolical crimes
the fiend who has murdered my sons
expense does not matter and i give
you a free hand in every way

  demers sat silent for some minutes
presently he washed out a new test
tube carefully shaped a spatula from
a piece of cedar and selected a stick
of wax well perhaps wed better
take a look over the ground first mr
ivors and if you will show us the way
we will start at once

 as we drove through the busy
streets demers asked him if jack had
been found dressed in the same sort
of silk dressing gown as gerald had
worn and was answered yes

  the carriage stopped at mr ivors
gate the house stood far in from the
street and was approached by a gravel
walk which wound in and out among
beds of flowers along the street was
a high iron fence with a spiked top
and the sides and back were inclosed
by a stone wall at least eight feet high
to the left of the entrance gate stood
a group of oaks and mr ivors was
leading us toward them to point out the
exact spot where his boys had been
laid but demers held us back dont
go near there yet he said well see
that later beyond the oaks was a

splendid tennis court and in the far
comer a little summerhouse

  we went up the front steps and mr
ivors let us in in the hall we met
mrs ivors a dark-eyed brunette hand-
some in face and figure evidently some
years younger than her husband and
the daughter doris who strangely
enough was very fair and blue-eyed
she was about seven years old after
introductions mrs ivors who was
obviously quite unstrung besought
demers to do his utmost to dispel the
shadow which was so heavy upon them
then she burst into tears and left the
room taking doris with her

  let me see the dressing gown first
said demers and ivors brought it from
a closet in the library it was the whip-
cord that he handed to me and as i
examined it something struggled in my
memory it was a greenish-yellow in
color like an unripe lemon and
roughly tanned it had been cut seem-
ingly with scissors from a wider piece
i felt i had come across similar mate-
rial before but my memory refused to
make the connection demers mean-
while was going over the blue silk with
a lens and he now called to me

  dont touch it he said but look
at it what do you think of it

  i think it is about the clumsiest bit
of sewing i ever saw for one thing
and the lace around the throat is of
the cheapest in contrast with such ex-
pensive silk

  right a man made it-a man who
did not dare to have it made by a seam-
stress for that would provide a clew
now mr ivors will you pardon us if
we ask you to leave us alone here with
the body of your son for a little while

  mr ivors had hardly closed the door
when demers had the lid pushed back
from the casket which held the remains
of the unfortunate boy and we looked
upon the face of jack ivors a hand-
some lad the picture of his father
the pity of his early and tragic death
the white cell



surged over us both as we looked at
him and it was some minutes before
we could bear to continue then dem-
ers stretched upon the body the dress-
ing gown to ascertain as i discovered
the approximate position on which the
different parts of it would lie

  near enough he said directly
hold my lens and these handing me
the test tube and spatula and he began
to undress the body it is not pleasant
work sometimes that of an investi-
gator of crime but it has to be done
when demers had bared jacks legs
he laid the body tenderly down took
the magnifying glass and examined
the knees with extreme care presently
he looked up

  if i were out on your moors at
cowleton i would yell for joy like a
maniac was his characteristic remark
look here i bent over the coffin
demers very cautiously seized the skin
just above the left knee and ordering
me to hold the glass so that he could
look through it he began to press the
skin gently then more firmly as i
watched i saw a thin film shiny like
the slime of a snail break suddenly
and from under it there oozed out in
two places a minute drop of a colorless
sirup yes id yell id yell like a
maniac id yell id yell id yell
it was demers way to mutter some
silly thing like that when he was
strongly excited he carefully scraped
the drops from the skin with the cedar
spatula dropped it in the test tube
sealed it and gave it to me in a few
moments the body was dressed the
cover replaced and we were ready to
depart mr ivors was waiting to show
us out

  advertise your house and grounds
for sale mr ivors said my friend
put a prominent notice in both the
morning and evening papers that for
personal reasons you must dispose of
the place within a week you dont
have to accept any of the offers that

may be made but it will enable me to
carry out my plans

  mr ivors assented though he did
not relish the extra publicity to which
it would expose his name as he was
closing the door my recalcitrant mem-
ory suddenly was in operating order
again and almost before i knew what
i was saying i had asked mr ivors
were you ever in canada

  the question obviously was unex-
pected he paused a moment before
replying no that his only trip out
of england had been to india

  demers and i walked to paleys
lane where he left me you can
walk around to smellies and leave
that test tube for analysis ill be back
for luncheon why did you ask ivors
about canada

  i was trying to remember where i
had seen whipcord like that before i
suddenly recollected my visit to que-
bec the leather is the kind the in-
dians and habitants there call babiche
they use it for their moccasins and
snowshoes i wonder how that piece
came over here

  three days later when ivors an-
nouncement of the sale of his property
had begun to attract the attention of
realty agents demers-who had not
said a word to me about the case in
the meantime in fact i had hardly
seen him there was a big dock strike
at the time-asked me after we had
lurtched together at tonis to go with
him to melton road where ivors lived
when we got there by arrangement
mr ivors met us and showed us
through the house and then over the
grounds as he had already that day
conducted three other parties around
i soon saw the meaning of the ad-
vertisement of course if the house
were for sale no notice would be taken
of a couple of prying detectives- who
were ostensibly buyers we had gone
over all the grounds which were not
very large and inspected the back wall


detective story magazine

where the only opening was a trades-
mens gate opening on a lane connect-
ing the two side streets

  as we stood for a moment in the
lane we heard a man behind the oppo-
site wall which was back of the house
facing on the next street parallel to
melton road indulging in an enthu-
siastic and awesome address to the uni-
verse on the general subject of vandal-
ism fools and trees we listened to
the flood of invective and then demers
by a running jump managed to catch
the top of the wall and draw himself
up where he could see the unknown
orator

  whats wrong he shouted

  the hidden speaker told him with
fervor and profane fluency what was
wrong here i go away to brest for
ten days and when i come home i find
some scoundrel has taken the liberty
of coming in and sawing off one of
the biggest branches of my only oak
look at it what sort of pruning do
you call that its a nice-looking tree
now isnt it and two years ago i
was away just two days at the hook
and again some kindly rascal provided
me with free fuel by cutting off a
branch on the same side its a lovely
state of affairs when a man cant grow
a tree in his back garden without his
neighbors interfering with it

  demers dropped back into the lane
and i could tell by the gleam in his eye
that he had an idea of a new sort we
had purposely avoided till now ap-
proaching the fatal oaks in ivors
grounds but now demers led me di-
rectly there and seated himself in the
exact place where the bodies had been
found asking me to sit near him

  now take this newspaper and hold
it up as though you were inspecting a
map-there-a little higher-there stay
there  demers was gazing intently
through a small field glass over the top
of the paper i held presently he said
change places with me you will see

a brick house straight east of here
look at the middle upper window and
tell me what you see i did as he
bade me but though i looked at all
the upper windows of the house he had
indicated i could see nothing but the
blinds tightly drawn down the blind
in the middle window appeared to have
a round hole cut in it i told demers
what i had seen and he seemed satis-
fied and you will notice he said
that our profane neighbors oak almost
prevented your seeing that middle win-
dow and that if the branch he is la-
menting had not been cut off you could
not have seen it at all

  on our way home we discussed how
a body could be brought into the
grounds over the high walls and fence
when all three gates-the carriage en-
trance the front and back gates-were
fastened demers was impatient at the
question that can easily be settled
afterward what were after now is
the rqan theres nothing very dif-
ficult in getting through a gate if one
has a little ingenuity here is the street
where the house stands which we were
scrutinizing here it is-no  i see
you go up and ask if mr jackson
byers lives there ill go on slowly

  i turned in at no  it was a big
house standing in very neglected weed-
infested grounds i pushed the bell
button repeatedly before the door was
opened by an old man ugly unkempt
and frightened looking

  does mr jackson byers live here
i inquired

  the old man pulled out a card on
which was printed i am deaf and
dumb master is not at home so
i wrote my question on a slip of paper
and he replied in the negative when
i had rejoined demers and told him
how i had been received he nodded

  evidently master is never at home
if he has that information printed for
the benefit of all who come to his door
therefore no friends or perhaps one
the white celi



or two who give a private signal when
they arrive a deaf-and-dumb serv-
ant eh what a man cant hear he
cant tell we have a clever gentle-
man to deal with alton but well see
what can be done as i went bv i
took a look at the house and its sur-
roundings and i see where we can get
in and in we go to-night

  we set out from the mountjoy hill
chambers about eleven oclock and
walked till we came to morning street
it was not a well-lighted street at the
best and no  was as dark as a
cave we kept in the shadows by the
front wall till we came to the corner
of the grounds when it was the work
of a moment to leap over the wall and
we were in the weedy lawn luck was
on our side that night we were mak-
ing for the south side of the house and
had just reached the corner when we
heard the door open and in the dim
light of the hall jet we could see the
master stand for a second before
closing the door-a tall fashionably
dressed gentleman he descended the
steps rapidly made his way to the
street and disappeared

  now for it whispered demers
follow me and quietly

  by the side of the hous was a yew
tree and demers said one of the
branches would get us to an upper win-
dow up he went and i followed as
quickly as i could by our combined
weight we managed to bend the branch
far enough for demers to insert a
jimmy under the lower window sash
with a sudden effort the inner fasten-
ing broke and the entrance was open
in another moment we were in the
room and demers produced his flash
lamp

  the room was unfurnished and full
of dust we opened the door into the
corridor demers led the way across
the passage opened a door and we
were in a room quite as dusty near
the window was a chair-you will

notice there is no dust on it said
demers-and in front of the chair a
small telescope was mounted on a tri-
pod facing a hole about three inches
in diameter cut in the blind

  if it were daylight do you know
what you would see through that tele-
scope asked demers

  mr ivors oaks

  closing the door we went down the
stairs to the next landing a door was
ajar and we peeped in it was a luxu-
riously furnished bedroom and seemed
to be in actual use demers stepped in
flashing his lamp here and there sud-
denly he began to mutter im sure
yes im sure certainly im sure surely
im certain it was his queer way of
communing with himself when excited
he had opened a wardrobe door and
displayed to me still another blue silk
dressing gown identical with the others
and with the strip of babiche hanging
beside it so theres to be another vic-
tim i said

  looks like it growled demers
but well try to anticipate that now
for the lower floor though we have
evidence enough now to hang forty
men

  after listening for a few minutes at
the top of the stairway we started
down the gas was turned down very
low on our left at the bottom was
an open door demers used his flash
lamp just long enough to take a glance
at the windows all heavily curtained
everything is safe heres the gas
and well have a little light he struck
a match and we looked around curi-
ously it was a large uncarpeted room
with well-filled bookcases on the walls
evidently the study of some literary
man the floor was a bizarre design
in squares and triangles done in vari-
ous colored hard woods

  by one window almost behind the
door as it stood ajar was a small writ-
ing desk with a heavy swivel chair
behind it and a smaller chair in front


detective story magazine

there was absolutely no other furni-
ture in the room on the wall directly
facing the swivel chair hung conspicu-
ously the only picture the room con-
tained it was a portrait by a german
artist with the title sin it repre-
sented a luxuriant woman with pale-
amber face framed in raven locks-a
young woman whose shining eyes were
touched with a smile at once startled
and sick with longing-while the cold
body of a serpent pressed its heavy
coils round her body it was a ter-
rible picture and a little overcome
by its powerful suggestiveness i turned
and seated myself in the desk chair
come said demers we must not
waste time here the man may be
back any minute

  i started to rise when suddenly a
part of the floor directly beneath the
picture gave way and seemingly actu-
ated by the same impulse a heavy sheet
of clear glass was projected out from
the firm part of the floor so as to cover
the space about four feet square where
the floor had dropped away

 demers and i sprang forward
through the glass we saw a large
chamber built of brick and illuminated
by a strong light which seemed to be
directly beneath the place where we
stood the walls were circular and
they and the floor of the cell were
painted a brilliant white

  our first business now is to find
how to close this up so that our pres-
ence here wont be known said dem-
ers one of us has touched some ac-
tuating mechanism perhaps stepped on
a cunningly contrived loose board
anyway let me see if this will work

  demers inserted the edge of the steel
jimmy between the wall and the glass
the glass moved back easily and at
the same time the missing square of
the floor began to swing up into its
place by moving the glass still far-
ther back we discovered that the pow-
erful illumination of the chamber was

extinguished we pulled the glass out
again and once more the light blazed
in the mysterious cell we could see
that the walls were solid except that
one brick was missing on the lowest
tier we were not long left in doubt
as to the purpose of that for almost
immediately there glided through the
opening a thick brown snake with a
peculiarly marked head

  the gentleman keeps a cobra for a
pet said demers

  i watched the horrid creature curi-
ously it went around the cell two or
three times raising itself and expand-
ing its hood as though to strike then
disappeared again through the wall

  demers pulled back the glass the
floor came up and caught in place with
a snap and we arose from our knees
evidently the picture is the bait for
this infernal trap i suggested the
glass enables the owner of the snake
to watch his victims death and at the
same time prevents all possibility of
his screams being heard

  well answered demers weve
seen all we need see here lets get
away upstairs

  we reached the room by whose win-
dow we had entered the house but de-
cided not to leave till we heard the
master of the house come in lest we
should run across him as we left the
grounds presently we heard him fum-
bling at the front door in a moment
i was out on the friendly branch of the
tree demers followed letting down
the window carefully as he came we
made our way safely from the grounds
and returned to demers rooms

  when i awoke next morning dem-
ers was standing by my bed fully
dressed i have just been called away
to guildford he said sanderson is
going with me and we will not be back
till to-morrow evening unless some-
thing extraordinary turns up dont
worry about the ivors case you might
go down if you like and see if smellie
the white cell



has analyzed that sirup you left him
and he was off

  i stayed in the chambers all morn-
ing expecting or at least hoping that
mr ivors would come in i exam-
ined all of demers strange souvenirs
of cases he had finished i opened
nearly every book in the study i tried
some experiments over the sink but
mr ivors did not come i resolved
to spend the afternoon making some
calls and visit ivors house in the eve-
ning i did so and about ten oclock
that night i set out for melton road
as i reached the curb in front of my
own door a womans voice hailed me
from a cab it was mrs ivors who
drew up near me

  oh mr ivors has gone out and
i am so frightened

  why are you afraid where has
he gone

  i dont know inspector sander-
son telephoned about six oclock ask-
ing him to meet him somewhere and
saying that he would not only learn
how his boys had died but see the
author of their deaths as well mr
ivors left me a note in just those
words and i am so frightened she

repeated to-morrow is- and

she stopped

  i thought over the situation the
telephone message of course was a
trap for sanderson was in guildford
with demers but she did not know
that and i began to see that she had
grave reason to jbe fearful for her hus-
bands safety the only thing for me
to do was to attempt to prevent the
carrying out of what i now saw was
the last stage of a plot already fiendish
enough

  asking her to wait in the cab i
rushed up to my room seized my pis-
tol and rejoined her as we drove
to her home i tried to assure her that
her husband was safe and told her i
thought i should be able to find him
without any difficulty

  mrs ivors if you expect to see
your husband alive again you must not
conceal from me any fact that might
help you do fear some individual
do you not

  yes

  is it a man or a woman

  a man

  what is his name she hesitated
but i repeated my question firmly

 edmund wynn

  and this man wynn has come into
the lives of you or your husband be-
fore for he knew the exact dates of
the boys birthdays is that true

  she assented

  why do you fear him perhaps i
have no right to ask that but tell
me do you think he is insane or has
he some reason which he may consider
a valid one for doing any of your fam-
ily an injury

  he may have a reason but i do
not think he is insane unless being a
murderer is evidence of insanity

  what is to-morrow   at this
question mrs ivors broke down com-
pletely and i could not learn anything
further

  i had not much heart for my task
for it was now drawing on to mid-
night and i knew that every moment
lessened my chance of ever seeing
ivors alive i concealed my anxiety
while i helped mrs ivors into the
house the instant that was done i
was out again and in the street i ran
down to the corner made my way at top
speed to the second street back and
raced for no  not a constable was
in sight and i had no time to search
for one though i did not relish going
alone on such an errand

  no  was the fourth house from
the corner and as i approached i slack-
ened iny pace it was useless to try
to enter the house except by stealth
the gate was open i slipped around
to the side of the house intending to
climb the tree to the window by which


detective story magazine

demers and i had entered the night
before but there was a dim light burn-
ing in the room it would have to be
one of the basement windows

  unluckily i had forgotten my flash
lamp but i felt around in the darkness
along the wall of the house and pres-
ently discovered a narrow window it
was fastened i was disheartened and
irritated by the accumulation of de-
lays was not ivors possibly facing
death at that very instant

  i gave the glass a smart stroke with
the butt of my pistol reached through
and dropped the catch and crawled in
feet first i dropped only a few inches
and found myself on the clay floor of
the cellar i struck a match to find
my way about directly in front there
was the huge brick chamber standing
by itself in the midst of the cave where
i was it was fitted with a low stee
door with a combination lock like a
safe it was the door of the white
cell where was the cobra my match
suddenly flickered out and i stood not
daring to move for one step might
bring me square upon its brown body
perhaps even now it was creeping upon
me in the darkness after what seemed
like an hour of agony i found another
match and looked about

  the floor was bare and clean on all
sides and i breathed freely again i
went up to the white cell and examined
it carefully at one side opposite the
steel door was a large iron box set
close to the brickwork and covered with
a close mesh of wire netting lighting
another match i looked into the box
the cobra was lying in one corner at
sight of me he raised himself and tried
to strike the wires but they were too
high

  all this had taken but a moment or
two and now i turned to find the way
of ascent to the floor above i soon
discovered the steps and started up

  now had come the most difficult and
dangerous part of my task and i should

have to observe the most extreme cau-
tion i took off my boots on the top
step and i pushed open the door very
slowly till i could see a light through
the crack a little farther and i could
see the deaf-and-dumb servant sitting
before the kitchen fire his back was
toward me so there was no danger of
being seen but i could not proceed on
my quest without attracting his notice

  by this time my anxiety had become
unbearable i drew my pistol and
started toward him but his eyes were
closed and he was asleep resolved to
lose no time i hastily opened two or
three doors which gave into the kitchen
pantry back stairs passage leading to
the front hall i was for advancing
straight down the front hall to the
study when i heard the tinkling of an
electric bell and at the same time a
green incandescent bulb in the kitchen
began to flash the flash recurring with
each sound of the bell it was the
masters device for summoning his
servant the bell i suppose was to
warn himself if visitors came

  i had barely time to open the door
to the back stairs and close it behind
me when the dumb man was aroused
by the flashing of the light and i could
hear his steps as he went to admit his
master so wynn-for i was sure of
my man now-had been out for a walk
while i thought he and ivors were to-
gether in the ominous house

  where then could ivors have gone
and how was i to conceal myself i
ran softly up the stairs till my eyes
were on a level with the upper corridor
floor and in the dim light of the hall
i could see the top of the front stair-
way if wynn came up those stairs
instead of entering his study should i
suddenly confront him or run the risk
of being discovered  i was in an awk-
ward predicament i could of course
hear no sound of voices if there were
any conversation it was in the sign
language i heard the servant return-
the white cell



ing to the kitchen i was still on the
flight of steps my eyes on a level with
the floor and i watched the front
stairs expecting every moment to see
wynns head appear the light was
still on in the lower hall i should see
him easily enough but i was soon con-
vinced that he was not coming up i
advanced cautiously till i was stand-
ing on the floor and then made my way
forward till i could see the whole
front stairway no one was in sight
i heard the scratch of a match in the
study what now i had been so sure
that ivors was in the house that now
i knew wynn was alone i felt i had no
motive for remaining it would be
better to slip away quietly and set the
police to find ivors if he had not re-
turned

  catching the scent of tobacco i de-
cided that wynn would be quiet for a
while and i would have a chance to
get out of the house some other way
i tiptoed along the passage to get to
the second flight of stairs and was
about to start up when the last flicker
of my match showed me something that
stopped me surely that was ivors
cane which had a most uncommon
head carved on it another match
near the cane all neatly folded in a
corner was a suit of clothes i lifted
the coat from which dropped three let-
ters all addressed harrison ivors
esquire

  i saw it all now i had come just
too late ivors had come-and gone
but between his coming and his going
another frightful crime had been com-
mitted ivors was probably lying now
on the grass in his own grounds
dressed in the mocking blue silk dress-
ing gown with his life stilled forever

  for a few moments i was stupefied
with the horror of it all then-the
murderer was calmly smoking in the
room below if i had not proofs
enough now of his guilt i never should
have but i must be careful for i

realized that i had a very dangerous
and cunning man to deal with one who
would hesitate at nothing to protect
himself i was now at the top of the
front stairs again i went down slowly
and the thick carpet drowned my steps
twice i was stopped by hearing a most
peculiar noise from the study the door
of which was half open on the bot-
tom step i paused and heard again the
strange sound which broke the deathly
stillness of the house i turned down
the hall and crept along the wall till
i was at the edge of the door

  if as i expected wynn was in the
swivel chair ly the window his back
would be toward me very slowly i
moved forward till i could see part of
the room no one was in sight i
stepped just within the door still keep-
ing behind it again that weird sound
i was now able to look around the edge
of the door and i saw wynn sitting at
his desk his head bowed and hidden
in his hands and even while i watched
again a great sob broke from him

  where is air harrison ivors i
had stepped out from behind the door
and stood confronting him with my
pistol

  at my first word wynn bounded
from his chair with a sharp cry and
stood glaring at me he was a tall
man with an intellectual cast of coun-
tenance his hair was slightly gray
but his fine blue eyes made him appear
almost youthful

  who are you what do you want
here 

  as i said i am here in the interest
of harrison ivors i have come here
to find him

  he is not here he left the house
over an hour ago the frightened
look was gone now wynn had dropped
into a pleasant nonchalant manner
which seemed his natural one and ad-
dressed me in the friendliest tones pos-
sible

  he was here then


detective story magazine

  i ran across some information
which i thought he desired in regard
to the death of his sons though i live
so near him i only learned of that
tragedy from the newspapers for i
go out very little he spoke of a mr
demers-i suppose you are he-who
was investigating the unfortunate af-
fair you will be glad to know that
before he left mr ivors learned how
his sons had died doubtless he is
awaiting you now at his house

  all this was spoken in a clear well-
modulated voice in which there was
no trace of emotion unless it were
pleasure at having been of service to
a fellow being and his story was so
obviously probable that i had difficulty
in remembering that after all we were
standing directly above the white cell
and its deadly occupant

  how did you enter mr demers
i did not hear the bell and will you
not put up that pistol firearms make
me nervous

  by the cellar mr wynn but i
kept the pistol in my hand my knowl-
edge of his name seemed to startle him
and i fancied his hand was approach-
ing one of the drawers of the desk
you have a very dangerous serpent in
your cellar wynns hand was rest-
ing on the drawer handle a cobra
isnt it i have suspected jack ivors
came to his death by a cobra bite and

i think you will have to come-

  did mr ivors walk from this house
or was he carried demers stepped
suddenly into the room and shot the
question at wynn who was hardly
more startled than i was at his sudden
entry upon the scene

  he walked of course just as he
had come

  mr wynn as i heard you called
it may interest you to know that mr
ivors is dead in precisely the same cir-
cumstances as his two sons

  wynn stood before us for a moment
bending forward as a man bends to

shelter his face from a harsh wind
presently he recovered himself

  will you sit down and let me tell
you about it i see you know the truth
i am responsible for the death of ivors
sons and now he has followed the
boys to the hell where he belongs let
me tell you my story no one knows
it now but myself and mrs ivors
when i come to trial i shall not open
my lips let the law do with me what it
will but i should like to have one
person hear my side of all this tragedy
that i may be judged aright all the
world will have its own opinion of
me will you listen and judge

  we assented there was a pathetic
eagerness in his voice and i for one
could not resist besides i was cu-
rious to know what were his reasons
for his crimes was ivors after all
not the man he had seemed but one
himself so guilty so treacherous that
even wynns atrocities had a semblance
of justification it was entirely pos-
sible who knows the dark and un-
plumbed depths in the inner spirit even
of the most guileless and innocent we
seated ourselves i taking the swivel
chair and wynn the other chair dem-
ers remarking significantly that he pre-
ferred to stand

  you caught me weeping do not
think that my weakness was due to re-
morse for five years i have lived for
this night of the eighth of june and
yet now that it is all over memories of
other days came over me so powerfully
that i was not quite myself you will
understand soon

  ivors and i were boys together he
was a couple of years older than i but
we were inseparable companions were
in the same form at eton and entered
cambridge the same day when we
left the university ivors married and
entered the army and seemed likely to
remain there i did not settle down
for a year or two and then resolved
to study for the bar in due course
the white cell



i was admitted but clients were long
in coming and i was devilish poor
with all my poverty and wretched
prospects in those days i was hopeful
and confident with a good-natured be-
lief in men and women the world
was a good old world after all-you
know the attitude in the midst of it
all i fell deeply passionately in love
with edith somerville sister of one of
my fellow barristers a chap whose
cases were as scarce as mine only he
had his family behind him you see
and miss somerville seemed to be as
deeply in love with me as i undoubtedly
was with her if she had only known
her own heart then she was beau-
tiful attractive with that mysterious
charm that even other women love to
look upon there was an unclouded
frankness about her brown eyes that
made me believe her a loyal royal soul
i did not disguise my poverty she
hardly knew what the word meant and
thought it would be jolly fun to try
living on three pounds a week

  i need not go into the story of our
hardships you can know that there
were hardships and how they would
press on my wifes young life but
she bore herself bravely and there was
no complaint this went on for nearly
two years and i was beginning to make
better progress in my profession when
one day i received word that an uncle
employed in the russian secret service
had died and left everything to me i
should have to leave for st peters-
burg at once-that is as soon as i could
borrow enough to take me there where
could i leave my wife meanwhile her
own people were in france for the
winter i thought of ivors he had
been invalided home shortly before and
was living with his two boys at the
home of his widowed sister for his
wife had died a couple of years before
it was soon arranged that my wife and
my infant girl doris should stay with
mrs raleigh and i set out for russia

 my windfall proved to be worth
about eight hundred pounds a year but
i had great difficulty in proving iden-
tity and conforming to a host of legal
refinements that our code knows noth-
ing about so that it was quite seven
months before i could set out for home
how my mind pictured the greeting i
should receive and the pleasure and
relief my little fortune would procure
i was proud as any king-i was young
then-at the thought that i now had it
in my power to make up in some de-
gree for the privations my wife had
undergone for my sake when on the
last day of may five years ago i
reached ivors house mrs raleigh met
me at the door and burst into tears

   where are ethel and doris  i
cried she did not answer me but gave
me a letter addressed in ivors hand
which read

  ethel and i have decided to cut along and
start life somewhere else greenway is my
solicitor there will be no defense the
sooner you sue the better	ivons

 there was a little note from my
wife

  will you forgive your wife life has
been too hard too dull i cant stand it any
longer	ethel

   when did they leave 

  yesterday morning

  i need not waste your time telling
you about my agony of mind at the
disclosures made to me i did not
blame ethel i knew ivors with his
powerful magnetic personality and his
abundant means would have been a
temptation to women more experienced
and with happier prospects than my
poor wife i did not know what to do
i had plenty of money in my pockets
now and resolved to follow them for
so many weeks i had dwelt on the glad
picture of my home-coming and the
happiness of displaying to my wife the
means of our release from poverty that
somehow the feeling still possessed me
that i must even yet find her and tell


detective story magazine

her it did not take much ingenuity to
discover that they had sailed for india
via canada i followed on the next
steamer and even during the brooding
loneliness of those long days and nights
on board ship i could not clearly define
to myself what i would say or do when
i confronted my wife but i wanted
to see her again and my little child

  at length on june th i reached
quebec two days behind the moranic
on which ivors had crossed i searched
the register of guests in two hotels be-
fore i found at the hotel montmor-
enci the names henry ivors wife
and child the clerk told me the num-
bers of their rooms but said mr ivors
had stepped out it was my chance

  i went up the broad staircase and
found the rooms by the numbers on
the doors as i stood for a moment
i heard a low voice sing a lullaby
doris was being put to sleep i pushed
open the door and entered and was
greeted only with a startled exclama-
tion my wife was dressed in a blue
silk dressing gown with a belt of
leather the girdle was loosely fas-
tened and fell off i reached for it
and put it in my pocket-probably you
gentlemen have seen pieces of it i
crossed the room and looked at my baby
asleep upon the bed-and went out

  so tumultuous and perplexed had
my emotions been that i did not realize
till long afterward that i had not
spoken a single word to my wife dur-
ing the harrowing minutes we were
together we seemed to understand one
another without the aid of speech i
followed them during their whole trip
i was seen only once-at nagpore
where my wife caught a glimpse of me
it was the day i bought my cobras-
there were three but two have died

  gradually and in a very dull way
i began to formulate my future i
closed up the house in which we had
lived after our marriage and for a
time took chambers i managed by

careful saving to buy this house one
day i found this picture and he
pointed to the portrait wonderful in
its beauty horrible in its suggestive-
ness which hung over the fatal cham-
ber i bought it and one day i knelt
here and prayed to all the evil and de-
ceit and murderous lust that is por-
trayed there to sustain me in my pur-
pose of revenge i have even burned
candles before that seductive image in
my mad worship

  wynns eyes were gleaming now and
i could notice an insane passion gradu-
ally creeping over him as memory
brought up the past his flushed face
and twitching hands warned us that he
was becoming dangerously affected by
his recital demers and i watched him
narrowly expecting every moment that
his nervous control would give way
and we should have to deal with a ma-
niac suddenly he arose and stood be-
fore the picture

  you have encouraged me and up-
held me even until now he whispered
to it and i am thankful and content
he raised his hands before it as a
suppliant intensely responsive to the
whole shocking scene i leaned for-
ward in the swivel chair when to my
horror the floor beneath wynn gave
way and he was precipitated even as
his victims had been into the brilliance
of the white cell the heavy glass
closed over the opening so suddenly
that we scarcely heard his shriek of
terror

 in a moment demers and i were
prying at the glass to get it open again
but in some way it had fastened itself
too firmly and it resisted every effort
to break it demers rushed away for
a hammer and i continued pounding
the glass with the butt of my pistol
it was of no avail

  i saw a brown head and an agile
body appear upon the floor of the cell
it raised itself gently and moved its
horrid head back and forth how and
the white cell



again spreading out the curiously
marked hood in token of growing rage
wynn had backed to the wall as far
as possible from his deadly instrument
of vengeance the snake began to ad-
vance toward him i could tell by the
contortions of wynns face that he was
suffering the tortures of the damned
once he screamed but it came to my
ears only as a whisper he never
raised his eyes but his hands were
high above his head the serpent was
advancing and stopping presently it
was within striking distance still it
remained as though undecided

  wynn was absolutely motionless i
saw his tongue slip across his lips the
cobra raised itself a little drew back

its head and distended its spectacled
hood its mouth opened-and it struck
wynn still stood as he was and the
snake struck again then turned to the
hole whence it had come wynns
arms dropped to his sides but he re-
mained upright and when the police
and the coroner arrived an hour later
he was still standing in the blazing glare
of the white cell

  i hurriedly explained the circum-
stance to doctor smellie

  yes he said sometimes when
persons die while at the climax of a
powerful emotion their muscles retain
the rigor in which they were held by

  famous scotland yard detective chief dies

a lfred ward chief inspector of scotland yard who made two trips to the

    united states to bring back ignatius tribich lincoln former member of
parliament and self-confessed german spy died recently at- a hospital in london
england

    inspector ward was one of the best-known police officers of europe and
handled some of the greatest cases and investigations of recent years one of
the most noted was the solving of the theft of the famous seven-hundred-and-
fifty-thousand-dollar pearl necklace which took place july 

    the investigation of this mystery was one of the most remarkable examples
of detective work on record and was declared to stamp inspector ward as being
the foremost criminal investigator of europe

    all that scotland yard had to guide it were three lumps of french sugar
and a torn scrap of a french newspaper found in the registered packet that
should have contained the necklace

    the thieves who had hoped to obtain a consignment of cut stones when
they stole the packet soon found the necklace to be a white elephant on their
hands they dared not break it as the pearls were widely known through the
advertisement which described each one and eventually determined to sell it in
its perfect form

    two paris jewel merchants were approached and through them inspector
ward established the connection that led to the arrest of the four thieves and to
their receiving heavy sentences in old bailey court

sheriff parker crooked one
leg around the horn of his saddle
and let his horse drop its head
and graze while he took tobacco
sack and papers from the pockets of
his open vest and began to twist a ciga-
rette he had just reached the top
of a high grassy knoll and as he
smoked his eyes wandered restlessly
over the plain in front of him fifty
miles straight ahead the hazy tops of
the bear claw range stood out against
the sky line and in between the rolling
prairie stretched in a series of brown
waves broken here and there by green
alfalfa fields and shining irrigation
ditches at irregular intervals a ranch
house with its surrounding outbuild-
ings stood out in the sunlight and a
score of miles to the horsemans left
a faint haze of smoke showed where
the thriving little city of elktooth lay
hidden behind a fringe of hills

 the sheriff wasted no time how-
ever in looking toward the city he
had left there only a short time before
and his work lay ahead of him not
behind for a while he impartially scru-
tinized the entire country then his gaze
centered on a small red house which
stood near a clump of cottonwoods at
the edge of a little creek some half
dozen miles away despite the distance
the place was surprisingly distinct in
the hot glare of the midday sun and
parker eyed it thoughtfully for many
minutes before he touched his horses
flanks lightly and rode slowly down the
slope

  as he rode along silent and inscru-
table as the dun-colored plain itself
his mind was busy with the errand
which had brought him into that neigh-
borhood for many days mounted on
the roan gelding-whose looks belied
his speed and staying qualities-clad in
faded khaki gray shirt open black
vest and high-crowned soft hat pulled
well down over his eyes he had been
wandering around in a search for clews
which would lead him to the headquar-
ters of a gang of rustlers that had in-
fested the county for months gradu-
ally the trail had narrowed until now
the sheriff was on his way to jim car-
rolls ranch his mind settled in the be-
lief that the cattle thieves whoever they
were had established their base some-
where in its vicinity just what he
would do when he reached the ranch he
had not decided although it was in his
mind to ask for a nights lodging and
then keep his eyes open for anything
that might turn up

  about half a mile from the ranch
parker stopped his horse and gazed
with speculative eyes at the sight which
confronted him at this point the trail
wound around the base of a tall dome-
shaped butte and a dozen yards beyond
the trail-between it and a huge alkali
spring-was a mass of black sand
which moved and billowed in the after-
noon sunlight like the surface of a
restless sea barring the sheriff and
his horse not a sign of life was any-
where apparent and there was some-
thing uncanny in the sight of the rest-
sinking sands



less undulating mass which made both
man and beast shiver slightly as they
watched it

  the place was well known to the
sheriff as it was to every resident
within a radius of many miles  people
called it the sinking sand and in its
time it had sucked down into its bot-
tomless depths many an unwary horse
and range steer and several humans
who had approached too close to its
treacherous edge nearly a quarter of
an acre in extent it surged ceaselessly
waiting always waiting for whatever
might step into its clutches shaking
himself together with a little shrug
the sheriff touched his horse and moved
on after all fascinating though it was
in a weird sort of way the great quick-
sand had nothing to do with his present
mission

  not a soul was in sight when the
little officer finally rode around the edge
of the cottonwoods and stopped his
horse at the hitching rack in front of
carrolls house dismounting slowly
and stiffly he climbed the porch steps
mildly surprised that not even a dog
was on hand to greet him the door
was wide open however and he paused
on the threshold and rapped sharply
with his knuckles against the jamb
when he had waited several minutes
without obtaining any response he
stepped inside and looked around

  parker found himself in the main
living room of the ranch house-a com-
 bination of dining room office and
lounging quarters a long pine table
stih bearing the remains of a meal
from which a cloud of flies rose up at
the sheriffs entrance stood in the cen-
ter there was a battered desk in one
corner in another lay two saddles and
their equipment and a telephone was
on the wall opposite the door but not
a human being was in sight crossing
the room the sheriff entered the kitchen
which save for a sleeping cat was

  a ds

empty also and satisfied at last that
the dwelling was entirely deserted he
went out into the yard and approached
the barn

  here a score or two of hens were
scattered about over the sun-baked
ground and a dozen young calves dozed
in a corral everything barring the
absence of any human occupant seemed
exactly as it should but there was a
mournful brooding silence about the
place that somehow got on parkers
nerves though he would have found it
hard to tell just exactly why it was
not until he stepped inside the gaping
doorway of the bam that the little of-
ficer paused abruptly and iis inquisi-
tive eyes narrowed slightly behind their
sheltering glasses

  just inside the door half a dozen feet
or so from the heels of a three-year-
old saddle colt which stood tied in a
stall lay the body of a very stout man
he lay on his back arms and legs
spread-eagled and his wide-open eyes
staring straight up at the floor of the
loft above him he was dressed much
as was the sheriff himself flannel shirt
overalls and vest and a felt hat lay
a few paces away save for a thin
dribble of blood from his nostrils there
was no sign of violence or injury about
him but his first quick glance told
sheriff parker that jim carroll was
dead

  the officer bent over the body and
placed his hand on one naked wrist
the wrist was cold and rigid proving
conclusively that death had occurred
several hours before

  straightening up again parker
cocked a calculating eye at the colt
which had turned as far as its halter
would permit and was eying him in
the suspicious wild-eyed manner com-
mon to all young or half-broken range
horses judging from the blood at
carrolls nostrils and the exterior ab-
sence of any wound it looked very


detective story magazine

much as though he might have been
killed by a kick while in the act of
entering the colts stall but the little
sheriff seldom jumped at conclusions

  lifting the body by the shoulders he
dragged it a few feet then he gave
vent to a little grunt his eyes had
just fallen upon a small hole in the
flannel shirt sleeve over the mans up-
per arm and long acquaintance with
bullet wounds told him what had hap-
pened even before he raised the arm
to find it broken and that the bullet had
passed through it into the body be-
neath it was beginning to look very
much like a case of murder after all
and the officers eyes lit up with pro-
fessional interest as he turned them
upon his immediate surroundings

  but the hard-beaten litter-covered
earth floor of the barn could tell him
nothing and after looking through the
half-empty hayloft also barren of
clews he covered the dead man with a
blanket and returned to the house
thus far he had been able to discover
nothing beyond the fact that carroll
had been apparently shot from above-
he deduced this from the downward
course taken by the bullet-by a high-
power gun of about  caliber

  a systematic and painstaking search
having thoroughly satisfied hinvthat the
house both upstairs and down was ac-
tually deserted the sheriff sat down at
carrolls desk and ran through its con-
tents several papers taken from the
bottom of a drawer made him open his
eyes and purse his lips thoughtfully
but there was no direct clew to the
murder or the deserted condition of
the premises and he finally left the
room and went outside here he wan-
dered about until he had poked his
nose into every nook and cranny large
enough to conceal a mouse but without
any result worthy of note when he
finally sauntered toward the little grove
of cottonwoods however his eyes

brightened and he whistled to him-
self

  near the edge of the trees the
ground slightly damp at this point was
cut by the footprints of a large-footed
man who seemed to have walked slowly
toward the barn although the trail was
lost again on the hard clay beyond the
shadow of the grove a little farther
on the grass was broken and bent as
though by some heavy weight

  rolling a cigarette in a thoughtful
way the sheriff sat down on a con-
venient rock and smoked dreamily for
several minutes then he measured sev-
eral of the footprints with a pocket
tape finally he returned to the house
and telephoned the coroner of his find
telling that official that he would await
his arrival which would be at the end
of about three hours at the ranch

  by this time the afternoon had
turned into evening and the dusk of
the summer night was beginning to fall
a dusk that was considerably intensified
by a dark bank of clouds which had
come up from the northeast there
was the feel of a storm in the air and
as he smoked and pondered upon what
he had discovered parker watched the
scudding clouds and wondered if his
friend the coroner would reach the
ranch before it broke from some
notes and accounts he had found among
carrolls papers the officer was inclined
to think that jim carroll had been
mixed up in the cattle stealing and he
wondered if the murder could be the
result of some quarrel among the
thieves

  one paper especially among those in
the dead mans desk puzzled the sheriff
exceedingly it was a crude drawing
or map showing the location of some-
thing that seemed to have been buried
and as he sat thinking over his prob-
lem parker took it from his pocket and
spread it on his knee in an attempt to
sinking sands



fathom its secret before the coroners
arrival

  for a long time parker studied the
drawing trying hard to guess what
f r might mean and wondering
if the thing was really important or
only a sketch of some part of carrolls
ranch the figures might mean almost
anything but taken in conjunction with
the word dig and the crooked line
through the center of the map it looked
very much as though they were meant
to denote distance along some path or
trail suddenly the sheriff sprang to
his feet

  by george he exclaimed aloud in
an excited tone that must be it
the general outline is the same and
if a man had anything of importance
to bury he could not pick a better spot
than the quicksand provided of
course that there really is a safe path
through it ive never heard of any
but carroll knew the place better than
anybody and he may have found one
that f r too may stand for flat
rock-theres a big one close to the edge
of the sand i remember on the whole
i believe ill look into it it may be the
solution of the whole business

  having arrived at this conclusion
the sheriff put the map back in his
pocket and he was of two minds
whether to ride out to the quicksand
right away or wait until daylight the
next morning when a sudden rising of
the wind decided him the shower
was coming up quickly already the
wind was blowing in strong sharp
puffs and big drops of rain were pat-

tering on the roof hastily closing the
doors and windows parker lighted a
lamp and sat down at one end of the
table in the living room to resume his
study of the map which now seemed to
be his most important clew

  he had been busy at this for some
time when all at once he thought he
heard some one step on the boards of
the porch for a little he sat still lis-
tening intently but aside from the roar
of the wind and the sharp rattle of the
rain he could detect nothing unusual
with the thought however that the
coroner might be arriving he got up
and opened the front door 

  by this time it was dark and as he
stood peering down the road the sheriff
began to doubt if the coroner would get
there at all before morning at any
rate there was nothing in sight at the
moment and he was turning back into
the house when a slight movement at
his left caused him to whirl quickly
he was not quite quick enough how-
ever for before he could protect him-
self in any way something dark and
heavy was thrown over his head and
shoulders and he was knocked to the
floor here in spite of his violent
struggles he was held and bound hand
and foot then he was picked up and
carried into the living room where he
was dropped on top of the saddles

  a moment later the dark blanket--
like thing which enveloped him was
plucked awray and he found himself
gazing into the grinning face of the
tallest man he had ever seen at least
that was what parker thought at the
time although he afterward realised
that the flickering lamplight somewhat
accentuated the mans height he was
tremendously big however big in
every way and he towered like a giant
in the low-studded room

  startled you some i reckon eh
he remarked with a throaty chuckle
i must say youre a cool hand camp-
in here as comfortable as you please

after killin poor jim when i found

his corpse in the barn i thought-

but never mind that what you done
with the money

  money sheriff parker looked in-
credulously up at his captor despite
his natural anger and chagrin at the
easy way he had been captured he
thought he grasped the situation
youve made a mistake my friend
i know nothing about any money and
i didnt kill carroll-i was investigat-
ing his death when you attacked me

  thats a likely story the big man
sneered in an ugly tone ive been
watchin you for some time partner
an i know what you been up to jim
carroll and i was pals and i aim to
see that you get whats cornin to you
after i locate that cache ah he
gave vent to the last exclamation as his
roving eyes fell on the map on the table
and he grabbed it up eagerly

  for several minutes he studied the
paper intently paying no heed to the
sheriffs attempts at explanation he
merely laughed and shrugged his shoul-
ders when the prisoner proclaimed his
identity finally he turned and with-
out a word stuffed the end of a towel
into the officers mouth and tied it
there thus gagged the prisoner could
only glare his rage as the big man
folded the map put it in his pocket
and left the room

  for a time parker struggled furi-
ously with his bonds but he finally
gave up his strength was not equal
to the task of breaking them although
he could make the rope give a little
with cach violent heave soon the cor-
oner would arrive and when he did so
things would be put right after all
the big stranger seemed merely to be
laboring under a misapprehension of
the true state of affairs even though
his questions about the money and his
delight at finding carrolls map did
look decidedly odd the sheriff was
considering the possibility of the stran-

ger being a member of the rustler gang
when he was aroused by the chugging
of an automobile

  the soft dirt road made muddy by
the heavy shower caused the car to
labor considerably but it finally came
to a standstill and soon afterward steps
sounded on the porch outside unable
to speak or move the sheriff could only
wait until the door swung open and the
coroner stepped into the room giving
vent to a little outcry and a start of
surprise when his eyes fell on the help-
less man in the corner he was just
springing toward him when a tall figure
loomed up behind and there was a dull
thud the coroner collapsed in his
tracks

  humph another one of you eh
the big man stooped over his latest
victim and carefully searched his pock-
ets bringing to light among other ar-
ticles a revolver which he tossed on a
chair

  i hope this is the last he muttered
as he dragged the senseless man away
from the door ive got my work
cut out for me as it is but i can make
it now the shower is over an the moon
cornin up that quicksand was sure
some hidin place for the loot i hardly
gave jim credit for that much brains
-thought id find the stuff about the
place here somewheres after our tussle
in the grove this mornin oh yes i
shot him-had to in self-defense-an
theres no use tryin to keep up the bluff
any longer as it is ill have the coin
and be plumb gone away before you
or your partner here is able to take
after me

  he turned and strode heavily out of
the room without another word

  sheriff parker chewed savagely at
the rag in his mouth he saw the whole
thing now and he was mad clear
through carroll and the big man had
been partners in the cattle stealing and
carroll had hidden the proceeds of
their thievery then they had quar-
sinking sands



reled and carroll had been killed now
the stranger was on his way to the
quicksand to dig up the loot and hide
himself in the hills before any one could
get on his track

  possessed with but one thought-the
determination of arresting the mur-
derer before he could get clear away
the sheriff renewed his assault on his
bonds with all the strength he had as
before however his efforts seemed
useless and he was on the point of
falling back exhausted when his eyes
lighted suddenly

  lying on the littered table not far
from the edge was a long keen-bladed
carving knife and if he could reach it
all might yet be well rolling off the
saddles he managed to hitch himself
along the floor until he could reach one
leg of the table and joggle it violently
by throwing his body against it at
the end of ten minutes of violent exer-
tion the knife fell on the floor and
within five minutes more the officers
hands were free when he had untied
his feet he stooped over the coroner
for an instant saw that he was only
stunned and smiled grimly then he
caught up the revolver on the chair-
his own weapons had been taken by
the murderer-and hurried out of the
house

  kneeling in the middle of the heav-
ing black sand which - in the faint
moonlight seemed even more repellent
than by day the murderer was digging
with his bare hands when the sheriff
crept over the top of a little rise and
paused to watch him he was digging
furiously feverishly like a man crazed
and now and then he cast a swift glance

to right and left as though afraid that
the hungry sand would rise over the
narrow path on which he knelt and
engulf him suddenly he gave vent to
a little cry of delight and reached down
to pull a small bag out of the hole he
had dug without pausing to open it
he turned and began to pick his way
toward solid ground

  sheriff parker watched him in si-
lence having no mind to attempt an
arrest until the man was safely out of
the quicksand for he felt sure that the
murderer could not escape him now
for twenty feet or so pacing in the
methodical manner of one who counts
his steps the big man zigzagged along
safely enough then something seemed
suddenly to go wrong-his right foot
planted carefully ahead of him failed
to rise for the next step for an in-
stant in a kind of desperate frenzy the
man tugged at it with all his strength
then he gave vent to a wild scream
which the sheriff could never forget

  its got me he yelled the sand
has got me and then he began to
struggle madly like a man in a fit

  the sand rose swiftly and with hor-
rified eyes sheriff parker watched it
creep to the murderers middle and
then to his shoulders with one last
horrible shriek the mans head went
under and the quicksand was calm and
unbroken as before still surging still
waiting for another victim

  shaking himself together like one
who has just awakened from some ter-
rible dream parker retraced his steps
to the ranch- where he found the cor-
oner sitting up and wondering what
had happened to him

the hand of the dead

six weeks after they were back
from their colorado adventure
donald carrick seated in the
carpeted section of doctor john
flemings wonderfully compact labora-
tory uttered an exclamation of wonder
as the chemist whirled about he beheld
carrick drawing very hard at his pipe
and staring steadily through one of the
windows 

  whats going on outside to draw
such an outburst from my calm friend
fleming asked

  nothing in the gardenette before
this window responded carrick
briefly continuing to send up great
clouds of pipe smoke

  fleming who had started to join his
friend now turned back to a bench on
which stood a test-tube rack containing
liquid in a dozen test tubes to which he
had just added as many reagents

  for at least three minutes carrick
continued looking out of the window
though he saw no near object at last
picking up the newspaper he resur-
veyed what he had been reading

  thats strange he muttered

  is it permissible to ask what is so
strange fleming inquired lightly as
hie reached to an upper shelf over the
bench and brought down a two-liter
bottle of tentlvnormal acid

  why the spokane of the blue
stack line is missing-nine days over-
due and not sighted anywhere replied
carrick shes a freighter last stop
san jose de guatemala bound with
general cargo to san francisco i own
a bit of stock in the blue stack line

  i see said the chemist nodding
looks as if she had been lost how
do you relish a slump in the returns
from and value of your stock

  not particularly pleased over the
prospect responded the master
hound though at the moment i was
not thinking of that incidentally
fleming the spokane carried in her
strong room something over two mil-
lion dollars in gold shipped from south
american banks to meet collections in
san francisco

  but if the spokane was wrecked
fleming argued the line is hardly re-
sponsible for the value of the money
the value of the money in any
event will come out of the pockets of
the underwriters at san francisco re-
torted carrick

  lets see mused doctor fleming
clamping to a stand the burette he had
just filled with acid solution and turn-
ing around wasnt the steamship hal-
cyon of the red m line lost about three
weeks ago in the pacific with two mil-
lion and a half in gold on board you
are beginning to see light i believe
fleming said carrick
li shoons nine lives



  not the light that is illuminating
or irritating your mind i fancy re-
plied the chemist with a smile if the
san francisco underwriters have to
face a loss of four million and a half
dollars it must make them peevish yet
how does it affect you you havent
any funds invested in marine insurance
have you

  not a penny carrick declared
promptly

 then-

  but see here fleming went on
the master hound quickly neither
steamship can have been lost in a gale
for there was no gale along the pacific
coast at the time either craft was last
seen nor for many days after both
boats are american owned had no mu-
nitions aboard so could not have been
blown up by submarines besides none
of the warring nations have submarines
in those waters it seems highly prob-
able thereforethat both the spokane
and the halcyon foundered in smooth
seas

  did neither craft carry wireless

  both did carrick went on his eyes
gleaming that makes the mystery all
the more dense no distress signals
were received anywhere from either
craft

  but there is only one class of men
who rob ships and then sink them de-
stroying their crews the chemist ob-
jected such men used to be called
pirates and pirates are extinct in these
days of steam

  that doesnt mean that a new breed
of pirates couldnt spring up donald
carrick interposed speaking almost im-
patiently for one of his equable tem-
perament in fact if piracy has been
committed in these two instances then
we are bound to admit that pirates
exist or reexist the point fleming
is right here for weeks there have
been no other losses in the pacific from
panama up and the only two vessels
to vanish are curiously enough the

only two that carried notable lots of
gold coin

  does the newspaper say anything
that could throw more light on the
double mystery the chemist inquired

  heres the article replied the mas-
ter hound you may read it for your-
self

  hastily the chemist scanned the
printed paragraphs then shook his
head for he had really learned nothing
that his friend had not already told
him

  if it werent a flat impossibility
carrick went on musingly i should be
tempted to say that the vanishing of the
two ships hasmany of the earmarks of
the uncanny work of the dread li
shoon but that can hardly be since
we saw li and his satellite weng-yu
leap to death over the edge of that
colorado precipice more we saw their
mangled bodies lying crushed in the
gully below

  that would be proof enough of the
death of most men laughed john
fleming but would even such proof
hold good in the case of an archfiend
and a piece of cleverness like our chi-
nese friend li shoon

  once more donald carrick picked
up the paper studying it attentively
through eyes one-quarter closed

  i could almost swear that li was
behind this job he grumbled

  fleming sprang to answer the tele-
phone but quickly swung around to
say

  telegram for you carrick

  the latter moved to the instrument
listening intently at last he said
briskly

  send that telegram here in writing
and deliver it as speedily as you can
resuming his chair and his pipe car-
rick smoked harder than ever sending
up clouds of smoke yet uttering no
word knowing his friend well flem-
ing asked no questions but continued
letting a drop at a time fall from the


detective story magazine

stopcock of the burette into a flask
underneath

  within ten minutes tako flemings
japanese servant knocked then en-
tered handing a telegram to the hound
then silently withdrawing tearing off
the end of the envelope carrick read
twice through the message on the yel-
low page

  see what you think of this flem-
ing he said finally and the chemist
read

  your two chinese fugitives who were
supposed to have leaped over the precipice
several weeks ago it turns out did nothing
of the sort their supposed remains in
the gulch difficult of access were inspected
closely yesterday proved to be only two
stuffed dummies in chinese garb that
were thrown down from cave in face ol
cliff near top the fugitives really jumped
after fastening around their waists con-
cealed ropes tied to roots of big bushes
at edge of cliff bushes show marks of
ropes signs in cave which opens into cliff
less than ten feet from top of cliff show
that four or more men presumably chinese
lived in cave at least two days then regained
top of cliff and escaped nothing has been
heard from any of them any instructions
do you mean to come out here to take up
clews beginning at cave and gulch

  the telegram was signed by bowers
sheriff of the colorado county in which
was the mountain precipice from which
carrick and fleming believed they had
witnessed the suicide of li shoon and
weng-yu

  i never did a more foolish thing
than not to investigate the two sup-
posed bodies at the bottom of the
gully remarked carrick rather bit-
terly when he saw his chemist friend
lay the sheet down

  it would have taken hours to have
reached that gully doctor john flem-
ing responded and the scene laid out
for us was so real that i do not won-
der that even you carrick were fooled
confound li shoon he appears to
possess the nine lives of a cat

  li shoon would make a cat look
foolish by comparison retorted car-

rick more bitterly it seems impos-
sible to slay him i never really thirsted
for any mans blood-not even lis-
but i am certain that it would not grieve
me greatly if i were to see him cut
into small pieces only then could i
feel certain that he had ceased to girdle
this suffering earth with his villainy

  are you going to do anything im-
mediately in this matter fleming
asked

  nothing more than to think about
it if you mean the disappearance of
the tw treasure ships

  i have finished this bench work
fleming continued as he lifted three
racks of test tubes and some other bits
of apparatus and stacked them neatly
at the back of the bench so now if
you do not need me i thought i would
run up to sylvias hotel and chance a
visit if she is out i will come right
back

  what if she has already vanished
suggested carrick though he smiled
for he regarded the chance of that as
slight it was enough though to cause
fleming to turn a bit pale with a
spring he was at the telephone calling
up the hotel where miss dorrance
lived he soon heard that young ladys
voice at the wire

  if i arrive in about fifteen minutes
inquired the lover do i stand a good
chance of being able to have a little
time with you

  an excellent chance laughed
sylvia

  ask if i may call with you sug-
gested carrick fleming did so though
he frowned slightly over the request
lovers have sometimes been known to
be impatient of the presence of third
parties

  you are wondering why i wish to
go carrick continued as fleming
hung up the receiver i shall not dally
long john but i wish to warn miss
dorrance in my own way against any
efforts that li shoons emissaries may
li shoons nine lives



make to lure her once more into cap-
tivity such as she was forced to endure
on two other occasions

  that will be as well smiled the
chemist thoughtfully though after
what i have said to sylvia on that very
subject i doubt if she would be likely
to be trapped by anything less than
downright force

  for five minutes fleming busied him-
self with his toilet then passing his
own inspection in a mirror he turned
away just as tako came in to report
that the doctors motor which he had
ordered brought round stood at the
door fleming and his friend went out
the former taking his place at the steer-
ing wheel quite punctually to their
appointment they presented themselves
at the hotel desk to have their names
telephoned up to miss dorrances
rooms two minutes later the callers
were received by the elder and the
younger miss dorrance

  we did not know but that you had
already vanished smiled donald car-
rick unfortunately we have news
that li shoon though officially dead is
again at large

  you cannot mean it gasped sylvia
dorrance much of the color fading
from her lovely face

  it is true replied fleming while
carrick pleasantly inquired 	s-

  has li made any effqrt to get you
away from your hotel again to some
point at which you might again fall into
his power

  no said sylvia dorrance regain-
ing most of her composure on the
contrary in yesterday afternoons mail
i received a much pleasanter letter and
one which auntie and i have been won-
dering if we could not accept it was
from elsie duveen one of my school
chums she and her mother are at
citrusville california and they have
invited us to spend a few weeks with
them

  california quickly inquired car-
rick barely concealing his deep interest

  here is the note said miss dor-
rance rising going to a desk and re-
turning with a folded scented sheet of
paper perhaps you can read elsies
horrible scrawl i used to tell her that
she had never really learned to write

  and this is her writing-her own
writing carrjck inquired as he
glanced at the letter

  there can be no mistaking elsies
handwriting said miss dbrrance

  thank you said carrick passing
back the sheet after having read it
through miss dorrance may i ad-
vise you not to think of starting to cali-
fornia until i am able better to advise
you 

  why-what-do you really think
asked the young woman in astonish-
ment

  later to-day i shall be able to tell
you just what i think donald carrick
replied rising and when i advise
you i shall know

  most courteously he took leave of
the ladies next nodding cheerily to
doctor john fleming who despite the
little that he knew of the hounds
thoughts now appeared to be a bit mys-
tified

  as he dropped in the elevator to the
office floor carrick said to himself

  at present i suspect old li shoon
of knowing all about the disappearance
of the treasure ships inside of two
or three hours i think i shall know posi-
tively whether that yellow scoundrel is
now after the yellow metal of ships on
the pacific

chapter ii

smoke from the blue stack

ctopping at the office of the man-
ager of the hotel carrick said
i wish to send a telegram in your
name and will show it to you in a
moment


detective story magazine

  i know it will be all right said
his friend the manager

  seating himself after the other -had
handed him a pad of blanks the hound
penciled this dispatch

miss elsie duveen citrusville california

  highly important to know if you recently
sent miss sylvia dorrance an invitation to
visit you in your present home kindly
wire answer immediately collect

  to this carrick signed the name of
the manager and the name of the hotel

  will you- have this sent for me at
once  asked carrick tendering the
money with the telegram

  with pleasure responded the man-
ager after a glance at the sheet

  then permit me to telephone it to
the western union in your name and
at the same time i will call up an official
in the company asking him to see to it
that both telegram and reply travel at
fastest speed west and east

  within three minutes carrick had
secured a pledge that the telegram
would be rushed in the livest sense
of the word the hound thereupon
turned to his friend the manager

  when the answer comes you will 
phone me at flemings laboratory wont
you  he requested

  without fail carrick

  outside stepping into a taxi car-
rick gave the chemists address and was
quickly back once admitted to the lab-
oratory by tako the hound glanced
down at his pipe resting on a table
then shook his head

  it may turn out that i need sleep
more he mused removing his coat
carrick lay down on the sofa tossing
a blanket loosely over him for outside
the winter air nipped in strong contrast
to the uniform warmth of seventy de-
grees within sixty seconds after lying
down the hound slept nor opened his
eyes until nearly two hours later he
was disturbed by the ringing of the
phone bell

  answer to your telegram pro-

claimed a voice from the hotel and he
recognized the managers voice this
telegram is signed j n skinner
caretaker the dispatch reads miss
duveen and mother now absent for five
weeks on trip to hawaii due to return
in about three weeks 

  thank you old man was carricks
fervent acknowledgment the money
that i left with you paid the charges
both ways yes thank you will
you be good enough to send that reply
up to miss dorrances room with a
copy of the telegram that i sent in your
name  wrill you kindly explain to miss
dorrance that i took the liberty of wir-
ing in your name and will you kindly
tell miss dorrance that under the cir-
cumstances i strongly advise against
her taking the california trip i am
sure that she will understand

  having adjusted matters to his
satisfaction donald carrick again
stretched himself on the sofa carefully
covering himself

  it must never be forgotten he
murmured to himself that li shoon
is an adept at forgery or controls the
services of such an adept nor must
it be forgotten that his yellow and
brown crew know well how to secure
specimens of handwriting that are to be
forged miss duveen did not write
the letter that sylvia dorrance showed
to me li shoon did write it or caused
it to be written miss dorrance must
have told him something about miss
duveen or else li obtained his infor-
mation in other ways though twice
the trick has proved futile li shoon
again sought to get miss dorrance
where she could be easily taken in un-
der his impelling control and that in
order to have a strong hold on fleming
and myself compelling our remaining
passive if li wanted miss dorrance
under his power in california then li
is also there or else he used california
as a headquarters therefore consid-
ering all the other facts that i now
li shoons nine lives



know one thing is certain li shoon is
behind and responsible for the vanish-
ment of the two treasure ships will
another or some more treasure ships
vanish from the surface of the sea
yes unless i can succeed in interfering
in season

  having reached this conclusion don-
ald carrick closed his eyes for some-
thing like thirty seconds he remained
awake at the end of that brief period
he was sound asleep to be awakened
only by the abrupt entrance of doctor
john fleming who shook the hound
brusquely by the shoulder

  ive heard said the chemist quietly
so miss duveens supposed note was
a forgery committed or inspired by li
shoon in the hope of getting sylvia
finally in his power is there no limit
to the ingenuity of that chinese devil
apparently not yawned carrick
sitting up and reaching for his pipe
and what ive learned to-day com-
pletes my reasons for knowing that li
shoon knows all about the missing
treasure ships

  a man trained as a chemist replied
fleming gravely would say that you
have strong reasons for believing that
you know the trend of lis present ac-
tivities but that you lacked anything
like logical proof of your suspicions
let it go that way then said car-
rick smiling indulgently however
li and his principal men must be at
work on the pacific coast or else they
wouldnt desire to lure miss dorrance
out there feeling that for this and the
third time they can really hold her from
rescue and that her captivity will
still your activities and through your
friendship will also induce me to quit
looking for the yellow rascals trail
for it cannot be other than li shoon
who has conceived the idea of sending
miss dorrance to california on a most
tragic wild-goose chase now my dear
fellow if your chemically trained mind
can admit that li shoon must be in

california or operating from there
then you must be ready to concede that
my next destination must also be cali-
fornia

  i shall have to grant your reason-
ing said fleming more especially
as i know you must be right anyway

  ting-a-ling-ling called the chemist
to the telephone

  carrick yes hes here ill call
him to the machine

  carrick moved over listened gravely
then directed quietly

  kindly deliver that message to me in
writing with utmost speed tell the
messenger to take a taxi and ill pay
for it

  turning to the chemist he asked

  john how long will it take you to
get ready to go to san francisco or
some other city in california yes
you are to go oh of course i under-
stand your reluctance to go far away
from miss dorrance but look at it
in another way the sooner we can
know that sod really holds li shoon
down in the bosom of mother earth
the sooner you may feel that miss dor-
rance is wholly safe for li will try
to get hold of miss dorrance every
time that he starts in with any new vil-
lainy he has an obsession that she is
a hostage who can be used to make us
stay our hands one of these days li
if he secures possession of your sweet-
heart again will in an excess of tem-
per remove her from this earth as a
rebuke to us so the thought causes
you to look a bit pale then you will
surely be glad to go to california with
me for this time we shall surely get
li and we shall just as surely bring him
back to new york here he can be
convicted of murder and executed
then and not till then will miss dor-
rance be safe and may we feel that we
are through with the yellow wretch and
at liberty to pursue happiness in our
several ways so run along and get
ready when you wish phone miss


detective story magazine

sylvia of course dont forget to tell
her that i am going to call on her within
half an hour with her cousin mr law-
rence semple you never heard of that
cousin i suppose not hes in the
criminal-investigation line and a most
clever and resolute fellow now dont
be jealous fleming even if i am going
to aslc him to put up at the same hotel
be known as miss dorrances cousin
and escort her about for a while sem-
ple is middle-aged a gentleman bald-
headed and has a wife and four chil-
dren hes a decent and cool fellow
and after i leave him at the hotel we
may both feel assured as to miss syl-
vias safety phone her now if you
wish fleming im going out to meet
the taxi

  nor did carrick have to wait long
at the door the message was deliv-
ered carrick after feeing the boy
carefully read the message before he
stepped inside then he returned to
the laboratory setting fire to the mes-
sage and dropping it in the grate

  the president of the blue stack line
wired asking you and me to take up the
matter of the disappearance of the spo-
kane as the company expects to ship
treasure by other steamers of that line
the hound went on you and i are
offered our own fees and all expenses
to take up the matter on the jump we
can hardly afford can we to decline an
offer so liberal 

  i cant fleming admitted honestly
but you humph you own more
money now than you will ever spend
youre going to accept the offer of
course

  i shall wire my acceptance as soon
as i have arranged for the safety of
miss sylvia dorrance and by the
way fleming semple will be only the
outward sign of miss sylvias safety
he will have such help as he needs it
will be part of our expense account for
the job that the blue stack line will pay
why not i shant attempt to fool the

blue stack people about it now do
you feel like going

chapter iii

the apparition of the uudzibu



has learned to keep under cover
well grumbled the hound nearly
a month later

  it is time he did agreed fleming
placidly he appears to have nine
lives but even nine may be lost in time
besides there are no more treasure
ships sailing the steamship companies
have secretly instructed their masters
not to accept specie shipments

  they will resume presently de-
clared carrick rather moodily there
will be a ship start up the coast with a
whopping treasure as soon as i have
found the slightest clew to li and his
scheme of operations it would be
murder and robbery to have treasure
brought up the coast with a practical
certainty that crew money and ship
would be lost but dont think i have
been idle fleming

  i know full well that you havent
been idle was the chemists grave an-
swer weve put in breathless days
in san francisco and have raked chi-
natown with a fine-tooth comb we
have been in spokane and seattle
weve been in los angeles fairly tak-
ing up the carpct of that town prying
underneath and now weve been ten
days in san diego and theyve all been
busy ones

  the two friends sat just inside the
balcony of a parlor in the del coronado
hotel at san diego of the suite two
of the rooms were chambers there
was also a dining room and bath the
balcony overlooked the salt water near
the door to the balcony stood a mounted
telescope of unusual power two pairs
of strong field glasses rested on a table

  li shoon cannot operate unless on
the sea carrick went on reflectively
naturally he would not ship on a treas-
li shoons nine lives



ure craft itself hence he must have
some vessel of his own that vessel
would have to possess speed for on
account of the disturbances in mexico
several united states war craft are
sailing up and down the coast li or
his lieutenants if overhauling a treas-
ure ship would need speed if while
the operation of boarding and robbing
was going on a united states war ves-
sel were to appear li would have to
have a good deal of speed in order to
get away from some of our long-range
guns a craft of from twenty-eight to
thirty knots would be needed or safety
could not be secured that would mean
a yacht for none of the coasting ves-
sels possess such speed i have had all
the yacht registers examined and can-
not find the slightest reason to believe
that li has chartered any craft along
this coast where then did he get his
vessel

  a submarine perhaps hinted
fleming

  there are no private ones returned
carrick with a shrug of his shoulders
true one could be built but one could
not be hidden it would have to put in
somewhere for supplies and then its
existence even though it had been
built secretly would almost surely be
known

  there are little ports or bays along
the western coast of mexico where it
could be hidden fleming suggested
mexican rebel officials could be bribed
to keep the secret and could sell sup-
plies at outrageous prices

  a mexican rebel official might be
bribed for most things carrick re-
turned but it would be difficult indeed
in the case of a submarine the mex-
icans of all factions are daily looking
for - a possible war with this country
they have no submarines but would
sell their souls to own one for in the
event of our making war upon them
their coasts would be blockaded they
would prize a submarine that they could

send out on a mission of sinking block-
ading craft no there is hardly a shade
of a chance that mexican rebels would
protect li shoon in running into one
of their smaller bays or harbors or
even in appearing along the open coast
besides a submarine does not possess
speed enough to make sure of her over-
taking a liner the chance would be
too much of a hit or miss to please
li shoons longing for sure things
fleming we must find lis craft in
some above-water craft and she must
be an unusually swift one-therefore a
yacht

  the chemist did not argue further
he knew that his friend was generally
right in his deductions instead the
chemist rising sauntered close to the
balcony while carrick lounging back
in his chair blew smoke lazily toward
the ceiling

  i wonder if a yacht like that one
could be fast enough said doctor
fleming a few minutes later

  instantly the master hound was
upon his feet snatching up a glass and
gazing intently

  if that boats engines match her
lines cried carrick eagerly she
should be good for thirty knots an hour
see shes making for the harbor
going to put in here ill know in a jiffy
what craft she is and my new friend
at the customhouse will hold his tongue
about my inquiry too

  carrick seated himself at the tele-
phone table and called for one of the
officials at the customhouse a short
conversation ensued to which fleming
did not pay much heed for he was
busy with the field glasses that he had
snatched up

  carson will find out as speedily as
possible all about that yacht carrick
announced at last i shall remain here
until he calls me

  do you wish me to motor over to
the harbor fleming inquired

  no for if that yacht be really com-


detective story magazine

manded by li shoon or one of his
lieutenants what more could you do
than show yourself and perhaps put the
chinese on their guard

  so fleming continued to watch
presently he reported that the yacht
had run into the harbor and had moved
as though going to a pier but obstacles
prevented his seeing either the craft or
her possible berth

  she went in under good speed i
noticed that much the chemist added

  twenty minutes later the phone bell
rang carrick jotted down the infor-
mation that the yacht was the budzibu
of dutch sumatran register with a
mr ronnvald aboard as owner with a
party of guests a customs inspector
had reported that he saw no chinese
in the crew or among the guests the
yacht had put in for oil fuel and sup-
plies and would put to sea again as
soon as these had been obtained the
owner was cruising for pleasure and
had not decided upon his course or next
port of call

  thats unusual carrick added
after he had told fleming the news
he had received im going to note
that craft a little closer

  calling the office carrick ordered a
car with closed body to be at the hotel
entrance immediately

  come along fleming requested
the hound after examining his auto-
matic revolver and glancing at a set
of papers that he drew from an inner
pocket

  the car swiftly bore them to a point
from which they could examine the
wharf at which the budzibu lay it was
plain that great activity was being dis-
played in the loading of the yacht

  theyre filling the yachts fuel-oil
tanks with two great hose pipes car-
rick explained it is altogether suspi-
cious speed one would expect the
owner and his friends to want a little
time ashore after having been for days
at sea well take a chance or two

fleming perhaps the yacht wont sail
as early as planned im going to head-
quarters get some policemen and go on
board i have with me a duplicate copy
of the new york warrant for the arrest
of li shoon weng-yu and ming we
can take two officers with us in this car
and a whole motor patrol wagonload of
policemen can reach the water front
not far behind

  and there will have to- be some
lively apologizing done if it proves that
none of our fugitives are on board

  im a very convincing apologizer
said the hound smiling then he
leaned forward to give the chauffeur
his orders there was but brief delay
with the police two policemen stepped
into the car and more were ordered
into a patrol motor swift time was
made to the water front just as the
car turned into the short street leading
to the wharf carrick uttered an excla-
mation of rage

  there is the budzibu putting out al-
ready  he announced pointing the
yacht was indeed making for open
water at a speed of not less than twenty
knots

  stopping the chauffeur carrick
jumped out to confer with the police
lieutenant in the patrol motor that
lieutenant was a gem in the way of
knowledge of san diegos water front
the patrol motor returned as useless
but one of the two policemen in the
car took a seat with the chauffeur while
the lieutenant seated himself beside
carrick

  within five minutes the ocean-going
tug terence was steaming out of the
harbor at her best speed fourteen
knots turning south after the now van-
ishing budzibu that police lieutenant
on shore with his two remaining men
had most complete instructions for tele-
graphing donald carrick in a craft
of half the speed had begun his chase
-around the world if need be-of the
budzibu
li shoons nine lives



  yet aboard the terence unsuspected
by one even as astute as the master
hound chinese ears listened atten-
tively to the words that passed between
donald carrick and doctor john flem-
ing as they sat in the tiny cabin that
had been turned over to them

chapter iv

devotee of the sporting chance

re in the open water now an-
nounced carrick filling his pipe
as he glanced through the cabin win-
dow it will be a long chase my
friend you didnt hear my instruc-
tions to the police lieutenant did you
it was needless replied the chem-
ist with a wave of his hand i knew
that you knew what you were doing
and you didnt need my help

  do you believe that this fourteen-
knot boat can overtake the budzibu
with her best speed of twenty-eight
knots 

  it can if you say so and plan it
replied fleming with easy confidence

  im not quite such a fool replied
carrick the yacht vulcan with a
best speed of twenty-nine knots is two
hundred miles up the coast and on her
way south i ordered her four days
ago to be fitted and sent to a little bay
twenty miles north of san diego that
i might have her at need i gave lieu-
tenant allen a message that the vul-
cans master will understand he will
chase this tug which has wireless of an
amateur order some time to-morrow
the vulcan will overtake us and well
transfer to the right boat after that
-the real chase

  but why didnt you wait for the
arrival of the vulcan fleming asked
wonderingly

  because no one can tell what will
happen to or on the budzibu before
to-morrow replied carrick gravely

  but if you overhaul the strange
yacht at sea what then  fleming

asked you have no authority to board
her and can do so only by courtesy if
li shoon is on board and in charge
surely you wouldnt trust much to his
courtesy

  events will have to provide for
themselves was the enigmatic answer
which caused the listening chinaman
english educated though he was to
hold his breath and wonder

  it was in the wainscoting that the
chinaman stood hidden not only was
his place of secrecy secure but he had
easy means of leaving that hiding place
to go to any part of the tug li shoon
knowing that donald carrick could al-
ways be counted upon to dog his steps
had surely left the master hound and
his chemist comrade well watched m
new york so cleverly had the trail-
ing work been done that though car-
rick had not once detected any sign of
shadowing their whole course since
leaving new york had been closely
watched

 and this chinese member of li
shoons fraternity of evildoers had suc-
ceeded in secreting himself aboard the
terence because he knew when to ex-
pect the strange bitdsibu in port and
also because the terence was the fastest
tug at that port li shoon meant to
know whether carrick was really trail-
ing him in the event that carrick
tried to follow in the terence plans
had already been laid for sendirfg that
tug to the bottom of the ocean

  as he listened the stolid young chi-
naman-he did not appear to be past
thirty and was dressed in white mans
attire of a rough seagoing sort looked
puzzled but soon a wicked grin over-
spread his face

  it will be rough on me he mused
if this tug transfers her passengers to
the vulcan i could not hope to smuggle
myself into the transfer but doctor
li shoons orders provide for the al-
ternative of destroying the tug before
help for carrick can arrive this tug

will have to go to the bottom with all
on board including myself unless i can
manage to provide myself unseen with
a life preserver no matter - my life
does not count as much for the ui
kwoon ah-how as carricks does
against it i can die with our enemies

  the stolid shrug with which that was
said was quite worthy of the traditions
of murderous unselfishness belonging to
the dreaded body the uikwoon many
yellow members and some brown-
lascars and malays-had already sac-
rificed themselves in other treasure-
amassing adventures

  as i may have to be up a good deal
to-night carrick presently proceeded
i shall turn in now for forty-one or
forty-two winks and you fleming 

  i am not sleepy now returned the
chemist i shall take the air on deck

  doctor john fleming passed out on
deck using his sea legs as the terence
plowed southward against the consid-
erable swell on the water the master
hound was soon asleep the watching
chinaman in the wainscoting softly
opened a hitherto invisible panel that
he had constructed three days before
through the narrow slit thus made the
mongol eyes studied the sleeping face
of carrick

  shall i slip into the cabin and stab
him pondered the member of the ui
kwoon but carrick has the name of
being a light sleeper i might shoot
him but the boat is rocking if i only
wounded him and could not make good
with a second shot then my mission
would be defeated i must not lose my
chance through haste a few hours
patience and then i can condemn all
these americans to death

  so the panel closed as noiselessly as
it had opened carrick slept on dream-
lessly

  five minutes later the panel again
opened ling cheng devotee of the
sporting chance had been unable to re-
sist the temptation to bewilder and per-

haps warn his enemies-the enemies of
ui kwoon

  in his hand he held a tiny atomizer
noiselessly he sent sprays in two or
three directions into the little cabin as
the panel closed a subtle pleasing odor
filled the room-one compounded of
llang-llang and sandalwood

 and now donald carrick really
dreamed some unanalyzable influence
of that long-unsmelled but not-to-be-
forgotten odor caused him to dream of
that hidden chinese rendezvous in the
philippines in which he had years be-
fore first come face to face with that
prince of deadly plotters doctor li
shoon

  but the dream passed though for a
few seconds the gentleman adventurer
stirred uneasily in his berth half an
hour later the door opened to admit
doctor john fleming the hound
opened his eyes

  i say carrick what is this strange
baffling odor demanded the chemist
it smells like-let me see sandal-
wood or llang-llang or-hang it-
both of them

  i do catch some odor assented
donald carrick sniffing and now it
is plainer

  the next instant his features dis-
played a singular gravity it was the
nearest thing to terror that any man
had ever seen on the hounds face

  i smelled that odor first on a terrible
night he went on it was then the
dominant scent in lis headquarters
many thousands of miles from here
but it must be imagination-here at
sea on the terence 

  if it is declared fleming seri-
ously then it is odd isnt it that your
imagination equally afifects me and i
never smelled this combined com-
pounded odor before

  yes the scent is quite unmistak-
able agreed the hound sitting up and
drawing on his shoes i cannot ac-
count for it
li shoons nine lives



  is it possible that some of that chi-
nese crowd can be on board this boat
cried fleming

  donald carrick surveyed his friend
with a queerly quizzical smile

chapter v

wireless and wave crest

a fternoon had changed to night

    the two passengers had dined with
captain mike rourke the early eve-
ning passed carrick and his friend
were in the captains cabin as the tug-
boat plowed along a few miles away
from the coast	

  it had been left to the bow watch to
report the unlikely event of sighting the
long-vanished budzibu

  in a tight little hutch back of the
boats pilot house the wireless operator
leaned back in his chair headpiece ad-
justed on the chance of picking up the
signal q-q-q at any hour during
the night

  from somewhere aft on the hurri-
cane deck a figure might have been
sighted hiding cautiously behind a life-
boat only his head showing it was
lingcheng sometimes the devotee of
the sporting chance but now neither
taking nor giving foolish chances

  only the mate in the wheelhouse and
the bow watch were observing the
course or neighborhood of the craft
these two and the wireless man were
the only ones visibly on duty the door
of the wireless room hung ajar

  with an evil smile ling cheng
studied the scene it was one nearly
to his complete liking by the aid of
a tiny flash light he cautiously read the
position marked by the hands over the
dial of his watch

  from the course and the time
elapsed since leaving san diego harbor
i can come very close to giving our po-
sition he told himself with a low
chuckle and the wireless man need
not be long in the way yet i must
a ds

be wonderfully careful until after i
have sent my own wireless word

  after listening intently ling moved
forward in the felt-soled shoes he had
donned for this grisly work his eyes
taking in all that was to be seen ling
glided on through the night like an
apparition

  in the wireless room eyes closed
ready after the manner of his kind to
open them at the first click through his
headpiece the operator undeniably
dozed larry dorkins would never
wake again

  there came a swift flash a burying
of steel through flesh and between ver-
tebrae the knife was withdrawn again
plunged and withdrawn there were
some blots of blood  on the flor but
that mattered not in ling chengs de-
sign picking up the slight body of
the late wireless man ling bore it to
the starboard side of the hurricane
deck the boat was wallowing in a
rough sea watching the most favor-
able instant ling cast all that was left
of larry dorkins far out so that it
splashed in the sea and was swiftly
astern on the waves

  then ling turned though even his
stolid disposition recoiled when he
heard the incredulous wrathful bellow
of captain mike rourke as that
doughty master bounded from the top
of the railed deck-house ladder to the
deck

  not a word was spoken but the mas-
ter came on warily without waiting to
summon help ling crouched and
waited gauging his man and judging
that the encounter was one of life and
death worse unless ling came out
victor there was but scant chance that
he could send his message over the
waters

  so the two faced each other but
mike rourke was not the type of man
to favor delayed action warily yet
with a bound full of latent power the
tugs master leaped at the chinaman


detective story magazine

ling ducked dodged then struck with
the knife

  but rourke expecting that was not
to be caught at the other end of the
dagger instead his right fist crashed
against the chinamans arm breaking
it the dagger dropped to the deck

  one murddher is enough for ye in
a night bellowed rourke as he
gripped his man holding him with one
massive hand by the collar like an
eel ling cheng sought to slip out of
that coat only to find his left arm held
crushingly in one of rourkes massive
hands

  its not gettin away yell be doing
uttered the master grimly shaking the
prisoner as if he would empty him
watch below there bow watchman
is that you  send donovan to the foot
of the laddher

  in a trice donovan a deck hand
scarcely less powerful looking than
rourke himself reached the foot of
the ladder and hailed

  here i am wid a lad i want ye to
take hold av roared captain rourke
appearing with his captive his right
forearm is broken but break his head
as well donovan av he thries to give
ye the slip even av he does give ye
the slip let it be nowhere but over-
board 

  with that and steadying himself ex-
pertly despite the lurches of the wal-
lowing tug mike rourke passed the
yellow man down to donovan who
reached up to take the human offering

  i dunno where this yellow ape came
from announced rourke but he
killed dorkins i misthrust an threw
him overboard hould him donovan

  then still awake to all his duties
as master rourke ran to the wheel-
house where he gave orders to make
a short turn and put about over the
foam-indicated course as closely as pos-
sible in another instant the bow
watchmans hoarse tones tumbled all
hands on deck

  carrick and doctor fleming barely
in their cabin noted the abrupt chang-
ing of the course accompanied by the
noise of swift orders

  something out of the ordinary has
happened remarked carrick bound-
ing up and opening the door he and
the chemist were soon on the deck the
first very tangible abject on which their
gaze lighted as displayed under a deck
light was the now rather crumpled fig-
ure of ling cheng in the relentless grip
of donovan

  how did this man get aboard  de-
manded carrick indicating the pris-
oner

  ask the captain-he dont know
retorted the deck hand naythur do
i but this yellow snake threw dor-
kins the wireless man overboard
were putting around to foind him av
it can be done

  then a white glare shot over the
waters ahead the terences search-
light was being employed in the task
of keeping as close as possible to the
widening and gradually vanishing track
of white foam left by the tugs propel-
lers

  dont let that scoundrel slip away
urged carrick and strode forward

  long keen and earnest was the
quest for mike rourke believed that
larry dorkins might be still alive and
swimming more or less feebly rourke
was no man to abandon another he
was a finely competent master of his
seafaring trade and bawled his orders
from the bow to the wheelhouse yet
presently even a man of rourkes re-
source and resolve was forced to give
up the quest if dorkins body still
floated it had been impossible to pick
up a glimpse of it on the crest of any
white-capped wave or in the darker
shadows of the trough of the sea with
a gulp and a tear in either eye cap-
tain rourke was at last compelled to
give the order to put about and follow
the course yet for a full three miles
li shoons nine lives



on the resumed southerly course that
searchlight was kept playing over the
waters ahead

 dye see how i can do anny
more av me duty rourke demanded
hoarsely at last

  you have done your full duty cap-
tain donald carrick assured the tugs
master

  then its time to find out what we
can be learning from that-begging
your pardon sir-r-that dhirty hay-
then scoundhrel ive bro-oken his
ar-rm but ill be breaking his hear-rt
av he doesnt begin tellin all about him-

stranger or pirate

it was time to devote some attention
to ling cheng for the members of
the crew were giving him an unwelcome
amount of consideration donovan was
doing his best to keep his grip on the
captive and at the same time to fight
off four angry deck hands who ap-
peared bent on at least a partial lynch-
ing of the unpopular mongol

  captain shouted donovan ill be
glad whin yere relievin me came
hoarsely from the temporary captor
its not much longer ill be able to
hould on to the pig-tailed reprobate

 avast there lads bellowed
rourke striding down the deck shove
off there will ye if its anny wan
to be killin the yellow lowlife ill be
doin it mesilf twas i that caught
him red-handed

  elbowing his way through captain
rourke grabbed hold of ling nodding
to donovan to step aside

  drown the heathen demanded the
crew angrily

  im not blamin ye lads retorted
captain mike rourke an maybe well
soon be doin that very thing itll all
depind on the way the scoundhrel talks

up an tells what he knows come along
wid ye chink

  into the dining room rourke dragged
ling cheng that being the largest room
available for an inquisition having
hurled the yellow man inside and beck-
oned carrick and fleming to follow
him rourke carefully locked the door
dropping the key into his own pocket
a now stand up me lad an let me
frisk ye ordered the tugs master
forcing ling to stand in the middle of
the room away from the tables folded
against the walls rourke ran his hands
up and down ovej the chinamans
clothing without finding any weapons
ling had left a revolver in his hiding
place in the wainscoting

  yeve no fightin tools on ye
rourke conceded at last now ye
yellow disgrace talk up for yersilf
what can ye say

 ling cheng shook his head as though
to convey that he did not understand

   ye can talk some english all right
ill be bound rourke roared at him
now will ye make a good thry or do
ye prefer some av this

  this was the burly fist that the
master shook under the assassins nose

  im beggin yer pardon gintlemin
rourke continued glancing at his pas-
sengers but this is a black-hear-rted
murtherer an he killed wan av me
crew so av he wont condescind to
talk thin the least i can do will be to
trim his face for him

  go ahead said carrick who did
not see the necessity for applying the
rules of ordinary humanity to one of
li shoons aids

  now will ye talk last call
warned rourke

  but the chinaman again shook his
head whereupon rourke let fly with
his fist hurling ling across the room
the chinaman folding up into a heap
on the floor after him sprang the
tugs master picking up the wretch and
administering to him a shaking that

threatened to dismember the wretched
victim this course was punctuated
with blows that must have left welts

  now thin whats your name your
josh-house name mind ye bellowed
rourke

  ling cheng came rather promptly

  good enough  vouchsafed rourke
now yeve shown that ye know eng-
lish so be quick with yer other answers
how did you come to be on this boat

  no savee replied ling trying to
look perplexed

  yell savee all right whin im
through wid ye retorted rourke ad-
ministering more of the recent treat-
ment ling must have ached from
head to foot when rourke hurled him
to a sitting posture in a chair now
thin tell me how ye came aboard this
boat

  me stow awhile chattered ling

  stowed away ye mean all right
why did ye do it

  no savee

  smash  whack ling suffered from
the course in chastisement when
rourkes question was repeated insist-
ently he at length answered

  me think you go mebbe mexico side
me want get there-no pay fare

  and was that why ye murthered me
wirelessman  demanded rourke

  again ling cheng was troubled by a
fit of silence nor could rourkes fistic
persuasion induce him to talk

  yed better be tellin me the tugs
master warned the yellow assassin
av ye dont i may decide to let me
crew in here av i do they will get
something out av ye av its only yer
life

  but ling persisted in remaining sul-
lenly silent rourke was too big-
hearted possessed too large a sense of
fair play to go beyond a certain point
in manhandling even a chinese assassin

  bad luck to ye thin for an obstinate
haythen growled the tugs master

av ye wont talk at all thin well lave
it to the american courts to take it out
av ye wid the electhric chair yell get
that all right as soon as i return wid
ye to the states and hand ye over to the
law in the meantime tis no chance
yell have to betther yersilf wid not
speakin yeve shown that ye can un
dherstand english and yell do no eat-
ing nor drink anny wather until yeve
loosed up the joints av yer tongue so
now ill be takin ye to a room that yell
find to be as stout a brig as iver aven a
decent american sailor was iver locked
up in come on wid ye

  gripping lings collar rourke led
him to the door unlocked it and
stepped with his prisoner out on to deck
to face the wrathful waiting crew

  r-r-rip swift as a flash the seem-
ingly cowed ling cheng tore out of
his jacket away from the captain he
bounded diving between two deck
hands

 gr-r-rab him bellowed mike
rourke

  but all hands reached the rail too
late leaping up there ling without
an instants hesitation dove into the
sea he sank as though his body had
been drawn in under the crafts hull

  all in one breath rourke gave the
order to turn and put about in a wide
arc the tug obeyed her helm back
over the course went the tug and again
the searchlight was brought into play
but the quest was in vain and rourke
at last felt forced to give the order to
go about and resume the course

  av hed only done the last thrick
first grumbled mike rourke id still
be havin larry dorkins wid us in the
wireless room

  have you any other man fitted to
do the wireless work carrick in-
quired

  not a one rejoined rourke twas
that quick ye called me into ser-rvice
the day that i had no time to get
li shoons nine lives



hold of me other wireless man tim
shea

  then i must get up to the wireless
room carrick went on there must
be some one listening for signals or
the master of the vulcan would deem
himself on the wrong course and per-
haps turn aside

  fleming with rourke accompanied
carrick to the wireless room where the
three men gazed solemnly at the blood-
stains on the floor but carrick his
work of the night on his mind sat
down adjusting the headpiece that had
been so rudely wrenched from the head
of dorkins

  not during the next hour was there
a call such as he listened for at last
carrick bending forward over the key
tested the apparatus though weak it
responded to the test

  q-q-q signaled the hound into
the air he waited but no response
came

  the current doesnt drive far
enough for the vulcan to pick us up i
imagine he commented to the chemist

  or else perhaps li shoon has
agents on that yacht as he had aboard
this craft fleming suggested solemnly

  it doesnt seem possible and yet it
may be the case carrick assented
after a few moments thought if the
vulcan is done for then so is our quest
for the present anyway for she was
the one and only boat of the right speed
that i could find for our task

  it was after one in the morning and
rourke had turned in when the voice
of the bow watch reached the ears of
the friends in the wireless room as he
hailed

  strange craft five points off the port
bow sir seems to be making off from
the fttex shore sir thought i saw
her use her searchlight for a single
short flash but its dead just now

  fleming bounded outside carrick
laying aside his headpiece followed
quickly both edged around to the port

side of the wheelhouse to find the sec-
ond mate who had turned the wheel
over to a man sweeping the shoreward
horizon with a night glass

  can you make out anything car-
rick asked

  yes sir theres a craft there i
can make out masts but no hull she
must be under power but i cant make
out any smoke cloud

  an oil burner then hinted the
hound

  must be sir im wondering if id
better call the captain

  do you think the stranger is travel-
ing full speed demanded carrick

  too far away to be certain sir but
i should say she was

  then you would better call cap-
tain rourke advised donald carrick
quietly while to fleming he added in
an undertone if its the budsiku
then perhaps ling succeeded in signal-
ing her before fate overtook him and
shes trying to overhaul us

  trying to overhaul us retorted
the chemist she wont have to try
that greyhound cant fail to overtake
this slab-hulled sea cripple if she
overhauls us it will be a trip to the
bottom for us

  what did you say sir inquired
the second mate

  my friend was just saying replied
carrick calmly that it will be a very
excellent idea to call captain rourke
and to tell him that im afraid were
running into more trouble than hed
be willing to believe

  anything more than that sir per-
sisted the watch officer

  isnt that enough demanded the
master hound how strong a mes-
sage does it take to call your captain
from his bunk in the middle of the
night if that doesnt rout him out
just whisper the word pirates but
hurry my friend davy jones is wait-
ing for us at the bottom of the ocean

suspicion and the searchlight

captain mike rourke was
   speedily on deck

  whats this im hearin about a
pirate he demanded as he picked up
a pair of glasses and stood at the open
port window of the wheelhouse

  that craft over yonder carrick
answered quietly

  a pirate eh  remarked captain
mike taking a long look through the
glass dont ye call that inthresting
sir-r

  there was no hurry in his voice or
manner on the contrary it was plain
that he by no means discredited the in-
formation that had been offered him

  the strange craft the budzibu or
whatever she was remained for several
minutes at about the same angle on
the port bow she was making much
faster time than the terence could do
and was plainly moving to intercept the
tug

  would ye be afther likin me to
change the course asked captain
rourke

  what would be the use ques-
tioned carrick that craft can over-
take us and changing the course would
be interpreted as conscious flight on our
part

  nearer and nearer dashed the over-
taking yacht her hull was now
plainly visible

  its the budsibu an no mistake
commented captain rourke now out
on the deck behind the wheelhouse as
he studied the stranger i mar-rked
her well whin she came into por-rt

  im going to get out of sight before
she plays the searchlight on us de-
clared carrick i might be recog-
nized if that yacht is bossed by the
man who i think controls her move-
ments

  what shall i say av were hailed
demanded mike rourke

  carrick gave the master some gen-
eral instructions

  and on the way you handle the
matter captain finished the master
hound will probably depend the
safety of your craft and of all on
board

  ill do me best to bring ye through
safely sir-r promised the tugs mas-
ter itll not be my fault av ye and
yer friend come to har-rm

  im not thinking of myself nor of
my friend replied the master hound
gravely fleming and i took these
chances deliberately i shall be sorry
if i am the means of bringing you and
your men to grief

  it wont be the fir-rst time that anny
av us has faced throuble rejoined
rourke and av we get through wid
this it wont be the last time well face
throuble ayther im thinking but i
thank ye for the thought av us sir-r

  carrick and fleming slipped into the
wheelhouse where away from the win-
dows they could slip out of sight at
need

  ten minutes later with the yacht not
more than a mile and a half distant
the broad white band of her search-
light shot across the sky then dropped
full across the terence

  shall i return the compliment by
givm her a glimpse av our own light
queried the master standing near the
wheelhouse window

  it could do no good carrick an-
swered

  presently rourke reported

  shes overhauling us right fast
sir-r an there goes her whistle to sig-
nal us that shed like us to lay to for
a hail

  it would look strange if you didnt
oblige the hound answered

  so bells jangled in the tugs engine
room and by degrees the terence
slowed down running under reducing
headway and then rolling on the waves

  ahoy tug came the hail through
li shoonv nine lives



a megaphone as the yacht also barely
moving rounded in as close as was
safe the voice from the yacht though
hailing in english betrayed more than
a trace of foreign accent where are
you headed tug what business

  me own business sure rourke
bawled back in a seemingly good-hu-
mored voice his lips to a megaphone

  have you any objection to answer-
ing us candidly came the demand

  surely not since yere askin us in
a civil way rourke returned the
red m two-stacker pearl city is in some
throuble wid her propeller shaft and
were undher or-rders to proceed down
the coast and stand by maybe well be
r-reaching her be daylight or an hour
later

  we didnt hear any wireless signals
from the pearl city remarked the
voice from the yacht suspiciously

  then im glad ye didnt av yere in
the same business as mesilf retorted
rourke a grin in his voice im want-
ing the pearl city job all to myself
but yere a gintlemans yacht arent
ye

  yes

  then yell not be thryin to take
the job from me for i want it and
yeve more speed

  you know well enough that this is
a pleasure yacht came gruffly from
the budzibu

  ive the best av reasons for knowin
it rourke retorted good-humoredly
you tould me so yersilf

  i think ill send a boat aboard of
you continued the voice from the
yacht

  are ye in disthress queried
rourke

  we are not

  thin yell sind no boat aboar-rd av
us declared captain mike be yer
own confession yere no mon-o-war
and yell put on none av the airs av
wan

  rourke is handling it well carrick

whispered in but the budzibu is
plainly suspicious there are six life
preservers in this wheelhouse fleming
keep your eye on one of them if were
sunk

  id sooner go to the bottom at once
than prolong the agony the chemist
answered

  cap sir almost whispered the
second mate theres a searchlight
roaming the sky to the south of us
rourke wheeled saw the distant flash
of the new light and took his cue

  yell have to be excusin me cap-
tain rourke bawled through the meg-
aphone av im not mistaken thats
our customer looking for us now to
the southard av here good-by and
thanks for the talk full speed ahead
mr riley as soon as the engine is
turnin well

  instantly the second mate rang for
half speed the engine room respond-
ing from the budzibu there was no
further hail though two men could be
made out as they stood enveloped in
caps and long coats beside the yachts
officer on the bridge

  within three minutes at the latest
we ought to know whether we are go-
ing to be safe for the present car-
rick declared as captain rourke turn-
ing his back to the yacht leaned in
over the window sill

  second mate riley leaving the wheel
in the hands of a deck hand was now
busy uncovering the tugs searchlight

  better signal and ask what ship is
to the south of us suggested donald
carrick and rourke gave the order
sometimes heaven is good to
liars ejaculated riley as the unseen
stranger answered with her flash light
in the code that craft is really the
pearl cityr

   twas likely she would be as-
sented mike rourke whin i lied to
save me boat and its people i gave the
name av a steamer i knew was cornin
up the coast or was due to


detective story magazine

  a bare quarter of a mile away and
still holding to the tug at reduced speed
the budzibu seemed to watch as though
her controlling spirits felt that their
worst suspicions were about to be real-
ized

  howd she be sinkin us av she
thried it rourke asked suddenly
after a glance over his shoulder

  probably she carries concealed a
quick-firing cannon or two carrick
replied she may even have a tor-
pedo tube though i would doubt that
for a tube is not easily concealed when
making port

  again the yachts searchlight lay
broadly across the tug

  shell not give up thinkin bad av
us muttered rourke

  itll be all r-right sir-r av she does
nothing more than thinkin ventured
the man at the wheel

  but if she fires on us suggested
rourke surely the noise av her gunsll
be heard by the pearl city 

  it wouldnt bother the scoundrels on
that yacht to sink the pearl city as
well carrick answered

  thin i dont see much hope for us
rourke growled for the boss av
that yacht tis plain doesnt like the
looks av us at all see the way the sea
terrier hangs at our heels

  taking off his cap and at infinite
pains to expose only the top of his
head carrick glanced swiftly out be-
tween rourkes broad body and the
window frame

  shes undoubtedly going astern to
rake us declared the master hound
gravely the budzibu must mount
her gun or guns forward

chapter viii
dangers haunting look

leeping just about a quarter of a
mile astern the yacht followed
along the tug did not deviate from
its course nor was any one allowed to

be visible on the terence aft for that
would have looked as though the mas-
ter of the tug believed the budzibu to
be dangerous

  none the less carrick fleming and
captain rourke had gone below they
now watched the yacht through the
ports of the darkened after cabin

  li shoon may decide to follow us
along until he learns whether the pearl
city really needs your help said car-
rick after a while if he finds that he
has been fooled li will then not hesi-
tate to sink both the tug and the liner

  why should he be such a murdher-
ing scoundhrel  asked rourke

  hes an international criminal
carrick replied rather evasively hes
already wanted on a wholly provable
charge of murder so that nothing he
can do would bring him to any worse
punishment hes playing a game for
big stakes and will stop at no number
of murders to advance his game or to
save his own skin

  thin maybe hes wor-rking for the
dir-rty mexicans  suggested mike
rourke but carrick did not answer

  i believe the yacht is falling astern
cried doctor fleming presently

  she is losing a bit of her speed
rourke confirmed

  though the trio watched with night
glasses they could not at first make out
the game after a little the yacht was
half a mile astern presently a mile
then a mile and a half

  now shes turning in toward the
coast declared carrick finally where-
at rourke bounded forward to use his
glass

  unless that craft is playing a game
to fool us thin she has given up the
chase the master of the tug an-
nounced

  ten minutes later the trio ascended
to the hurricane deck in the darkness
the budzibu had vanished it seemed
good to be out in the open air once
more for a few moments that thought
li shoons nine lives



dominated over the realization that the
tug had not been foully sunk

  i wouldnt care to know that gin-
tleman the wan ye call lou shine
said rourke grimly be all ye say
about him he must have a bad con-
science

  the best and brightest conscience
that you ever saw carrick reversed
he has never given it the slightest use
since he was born

  presently the hull of the pearl city
was sighted the two craft passed
with hearty steam signals at this mo-
ment carrick was sweeping the coast-
ward horizon for any sign of the lurk-
ing presence of the budzibu but that
evil craft was not to be seen

  i hope the budzibu will try to run
us down when we are once safe on the
vulcan carrick confided to his
friend

  ah then the vulcan is armed
when we are aboard of her we shall
be more nearly on equal terms was
the hounds response and the vul-
can is a knot faster than the sumatran
boat i believe

  may the vulcan travel faster than
she ever did before uttered doctor
fleming fervently it doesnt seem
so bad to be shot at on dry land but
looking out over this inky waste of
salt water i cant help feeling that id
rather not be called upon to sink be-
neath the surface and remain under
it doesnt appeal to me as my choice
of deaths

  what is death mocked carrick
lightly merely the end of the strug-
gle-the wind-up of the fight the
only man who is afraid of death is the
one who realizes that he hasnt played
the best possible part in the fight

  i believe said the chemist gravely
that i prefer tobacco to the abstruse-
ness of philosophy

  the night being fine though dark
the two friends remained up on the
hurricane deck with their pipes until

nearly two in the morning it was now
in the first mates watch captain
mike rourke had long ago gone back
to his repose a stern watch as well
as the one at the bow had been set

  it was nearly nine in the morning
when fleming opened his eyes the
hound was still asleep though he
opened his eyes as the chemist slid from
the upper berth to the floor

  im going out to see if the vulcan
is in sight stated the chemist

  you neednt have spoiled your sleep
for that yawned carrick behind his
hand i left orders that we were to
be wakened at the first sign of the
vulcan

  but fleming hastily completed his
dressing and toilet and stepped out on
deck though there was a breeze the
weather was noticeably warmer for the
terence was now well down the mexi-
can coast and the sun shone with
greater brightness nowhere on the
horizon did a sail spar or smokestack
appear

  good morning doctor came
rourkes hearty greeting dye know
im all over the nightmare feelin av the
night

  it didnt last long said the chem-
ist laughing you went to sleep as
fast as you could

   twas bad while it lasted de-
clared the skipper gravely ive been
on the salt wather a good manny years
but niver did i hear of a scoundhrel as
bad as the wan your friend is playin
hide and seek wi

  if we encounter him out here it
wont be our first meeting face to face
replied doctor fleming

  is it so now asked rourke with
lively interest wud ye mind tellin
me a bit about the rapscallion

  im afraid mr carrick wouldnt like
me to be too talkative

  dont you read the newspapers
captain demanded thevoice of the
master hound as he came up behind


detective story magazine

them some months ago there was
plenty in the new york newspapers
about li shoon the yellow criminal
who murdered a few new york mil-
lionaires after getting their property
deeded to him

  now i did read about that fel-
low cried rourke but i thought he
wint to the electric chair

  no he escaped and has been at
large ever since cariick went on
that is all i wish to say at present
a foremasthead showing in our
wake sir hailed the stern watch in
a bawling voice the trio turned hast-
ily glasses were brought into play

  its the foremast of a yacht all
right cried fleming gleefully

  yis but tis wondherfully like the
rig av the budzibu said mike rourke
tensely oh well with a shrug of
his shoulders av she is coming up
again it wont seem as bad and dir-rty
as it did in the night

  if it is the budzibu then she evi-
dently discovered that we had no busi-
ness with the pearl city and she has
been scouring the water for us ever
since advanced donald carrick of
course she has sighted us by this time
for she must carry a foremast look-
out

  more and more of the foremast of
the pursuing craft came into sight
presently the top of the hull began to
appear over the curve of the horizon

	id injoy bein proved a bad
guesser asserted captain mike
rourke but i must say that the craft
yondher has all the look av bein the
budzibu an no other

chapter ix

seeking the trail in old mex

the trio had retired to the after
cabin using the portholes once
more a messenger had been stationed
to hasten any order to the watch officer
in the wheelhouse

  line after line of the other craft
came into sight every new glimpse con-
firming the suspicion that the stranger
was the sumatran yacht

  if our suspicions are right an-
nounced carrick in a steady voice no
man now on this boat has more than a
half an hour of life left

  ive said me prayers already re-
torted rourke so i have a free hand
for me duties but im sorry for the
boys undher rpe

  fleming said nothing though he
puffed his pipe with a slight accelera-
tion of speed

  maybe were three fools hinted
mike rourke two minutes later av
me memory is wor-rkin the su
mathran boat had her deck rails painted
white this craft has shinin brass
rails

  that much disguise would be quite
within the bounds of lis strategy
carrick answered dont be too san-
guine just yet captain

  a wireless question to the craft
astern might settle the question pro-
posed fleming

  and that wireless would be picked
up by the budzibu if shes anywhere
within a hundred miles or so carrick
retorted shaking his head the vul
can had especial orders to use no wire-
less for fear it might be picked up by
the enemy

  a mile nearer came the pursuing
craft then shook out a line of signal
flags from the foremast

  were a pack av fools i believe
uttered rourke that craft wants to
know av were the terence an av we
are she suggests that we lay to for the
transfer av two passengers

  it must be the vulcan then cried
fleming

whether it is or not we may as well
go out on deck decided carrick
even if it is li shoons private navy
wed go to the bottom soon anyway
acting on his own judgment rourke
li shoons nine lives



ran to the wheelhouse where he gave
orders for half speed next a full stop
onward swept the yacht in their wake
veering to port as she came close and
stopping her own engines within hail-
ing distance the name plate on her
wheelhouse had been obscured

 ahoy terence came a mega-
phoned voice from the yachts bridge
this is the vulcan have you pas-
sengers for us 

  two av thim answered rourke
gleefully an mighty glad we are to
know that yere the vulcan

  from the yacht a boat was lowered
manned by a mate and four men
rourke was now busy in picking out
other details in which this yacht dif-
fered from the sumatran craft

  aven at that though declared
captain mike the two boats are so
much alike id swear they were built
in the same yard at the same time
come into the cabin a moment cap-
tain carrick requested having the
skipper behind a closed door the
hound produced a bulging roll of bank
notes

  youll find here captain the stipu-
lated hire for the number of hours
also a hundred dollars for each of the
mates and the chief engineer and fifty
dollars for each other member of the
crew they are to receive the money
with the distinct understanding that not
one of them lisps a syllable of what has
taken place on this trip before sixty
days from this time

  theyll keep silent ill go bail re-
plied rourke though im sorry ye
thought me min had to be paid to hould
their tongues

  and here is a souvenir of two hun-
dred for yourself captain carrick
went on adding more bills to the pile

  at first rourke stoutly resisted but
carrick could be a diplomat and in the
end prevailed

  by this time the boat was alongside
carrick and fleming slipped over the

side amid cheers from the tugs crew
the boat slipped away a few minutes
later the hound and the chemist sig-
naled rourke from the starboard rail
of the vulcan

   twas their own boat thin mut-
tered rourke good luck to thim-
the best misther scanlon the course
is straight back to san diego

  amid a din of whistles the two craft
parted company the vulcan skimming
speedily south

  carrick had indeed found himself
among friends captain mulford was
a bluff hearty skipper his two mates
gray and kerrigan were keen-looking
young men the vulcan a narrow-
built craft of some eight hundred tons
was sure to roll in any kind of heavy
sea but her social and sleeping cabins
were provided with every kind of com-
fort and many luxuries officers and
crew were nattily uniformed after the
naval pattern

  this boat is in the united states
naval reserve mulford declared
proudly we try to keep up the best
traditions on this craft but there is
one bit of information you may be able
to give me mr carrick though my
crew is large and though i never car-
ried more than two mates before just
as we were ready to sail the agent sent
aboard a third mate and five more sea-
men mr olney is the new third
mates name i believe hes sleeping
now he can sleep all the time for that
matter for the instructions that came
with this olney chap were that he was
not to stand watch but was to observe
and learn all he wished to learn did
ever a skipper have a queerer mate sent
to him 

  i- cannot give you any information
about olney replied carrick gravely
and appeared to dismiss the matter
from his mind ar soon as fleming
found a chance he whispered to his
friend

  donald do you suppose that olney


detective story magazine

and his men represent any kind of
treachery that is to be sprung later
drop the idea counseled the
hound the agent through whom the
charter was made is not the kind to be
imposed upon whatever olneys mis-
sion aboard may be rest assured that
its an honorable one and that the ship-
ping agent knew what he was doing
i dont see a sign of a gun on board
either fleming continued if the
budsibu carries em and we get at
close quarters what then

  in any event fleming i believe that
the vulcan will prove able to take care
of herself

  further confidential conversation
was cut short by the stewards call to
table where captain mulford joined
them the vulcans skipper was anx-
ious to have his further sailing instruc-
tions in full

  how far will your wireless reach
asked carrick

  all the way to vancouver if need
be was the proud response

  then be- good enough to have this
signal flashed requested carrick
writing on a notebook page the letters
b-b-b-f-h-g-p

  and then- insinuated mulford

  that will be all declared the mas-
ter hound

  that signal is being watched for in
san francisco carrick confided in
an undertone as captain mulford
turned to hand the message with
orders to one of the table stewards
who ran out with the slip of paper it
will tell all that i wish to say and will
start our campaign

  after luncheon third officer olney
appeared on deck and was presented to
the passengers by second officer ker-
rigan fleming tried hard tb make up
his mind whether he liked olney who
had an extremely sleepy look the
chemist could not disabuse himself of
the idea that mr olney was not nearly
as sleepy as he looked

  the afternoon passed without inci-
dent fleming noticed that two men
were kept in the crows nest and that
both were vigilant in examining every
visible part of the sea to the circled
horizon the vulcan at nearly full
speed was out of sight of the mexican
coast the course being as nearly due
south as the outlines of the invisible
coast permitted yet with all her
speed the yacht burning oil under her
boilers did not leave a trail of smoke
behind there was little rattle of ma-
chinery but a good deal of rolling in
the rather brisk sea

  for three days the vulcan continued
in a generally southerly direction in
that time more than a dozen north-
bound and four southbound steamships
were passed each was asked by sig-
nal whether another yacht much re-
sembling the vulcan had been sighted

  at first there was no news then
some vague news came the fourth
of the southbound steamers flew several
signaled messages in response to the
questions that carrick caused captain
mulford to ask then both craft lay
to a boat was lowered and at the
hounds request third officer olney
was put in charge carrick descended
the side gangway stepping into the
boat fleming not having been in-
vited remained on the vulcans spar
deck smoking his pipe placidly

  in three-quarters of an hour car-rick
could be seen coming down over the
steamships side

  wre too far south he reported to
captain mulford on coming on board
put in to mattanegua bay which you
ought to reach in the hours of dark to-
morrow evening do not approach un-
til wrell after dark and i will have
further instructions ready an hour
south of mattanegua

  on an altered course sailed the vul-
can but fleming felt well pleased he
was satisfied that the hound was work-
ing on definite knowledge
li shoons nine lives



  at nine oclock the next evening
captain mulford called donald car-
rick to the bridge for a conference
the coast of mexico was now just
vaguely in sight off the starboard quar-
ter at reduced speed the yacht pro-
ceeded at a quarter of ten when she
lay to the vulcan was not more than
half a mile from the shore low
sloping hills rose from the beach seen
through the night glasses these slopes
were covered with short dense growths
of what looked like scrub oak

  no sooner had the vulcan lain to
than a boat was lowered kerrigan be-
ing this time in charge

  look to your weapon muttered
carrick take two extra magazine
loads with you and a full box of car-
tridges

  i have them on me fleming an-
swered

  then well get into the boat

  while they were being pulled toward
the shore carrick continued to talk in
an undertone

  never much of a port mattanegua
bay is now closed to commerce he
said the town around the bay is
headquarters for some two thousand
mexican rebel troops calvoras their
commander is a typical mexican rebel
-arrogant cruel unreasoning and
densely ignorant but he is a power
among his men the budzibu was seen
to enter the bay and doubtless is still
there our task on shore is to find out
all we can about the budzibu and li
shoon without running into the rebels
or bandits-call them which you pre-
fer we are landing three miles below
the bay

chapter x

a hint of the truth

pausing only long enough to see
the boat pushed off to return to
the vulcan donald carrick turned his
back on the water to inspect the jungle
ahead of him then he tugged at flem-

ings sleeve leading the chemist not
more than a hundred feet into the
jungle now the hound sat down as
comfortably as though at his journeys
end

  whats the idea queried fleming
in a whisper seating himself beside his
friend

  both the vulcan and the landing of
the small boat may have been observed
by calvoras lookouts though i hope
not was the hounds response if
they have seen us and we do not pres-
ently appear these same lookouts will
come down to the shore to investigate
then we shall know that we have been
observed

  after that the master hound was
silent it was so dark where they hid
that the chemist unable to see his
friends face clearly wondered if car-
rick dozed

  at length the boat reached the yacht
which soon after stood out to sea the
vulcan was not running with lights to-
night and fleming could hardly be
sure of what he did see yet the mov-
ing of a shadowy mass told him that
the yacht had left them behind

  not until some time after did car-
rick after listening with his ear to the
ground rise and whisper

  evidently our coming was not ob-
served we will start on our way

  owing to the tangled masses of
shrubbery and low forest through
which they moved donald carrick was
forced to take his course from such
glimpses of the stars as he obtained
both trod softlyy taking pains not to
tread on crackling brush in the under-
growth

  in the matter of poisonous snakes
which are reported to abound here
whispered the hound during one of
their brief halts you must trust en-
tirely to luck we could not see a
snake in time to avoid it

  it seemed to fleming as though they
had walked for many hours when car-


detective story magazine

rick suddenly brought him up short
with a grip of his nearer arm the
hound pointed ahead to a glow on the
ground distant some two hundred
yards as the two friends stood there
observing they saw several figures flit
to and fro past the dying camp fire
fleming soon guessed that there were
at least a dozen men near the fire car-
rick from other signs that he detected
judged that there were from fifty to
sixty men ahead probably an entire
company of mexican rebel soldiers

  a low hum of voices came to them
at last the hound began moving for-
ward a cautious single step at a time
minutes passed ere the friends again
made a halt this time within plain eye
range and audible distance from the
little groups in the clearing as both
carrick and his friend spoke spanish
they were able to comprehend the
words that reached them in the mexi-
can jargon

  with the three thousand new rifles
and all the cases of cartridges my cap-
tain our general calvoras will doubt-
less soon begin recruiting and increase
his army

  it is even so lieutenant calderas
replied the captain and then when
our generals new and mighty friend
brings still more rifles calvoras will
take the field openly and we shall
sweep across mexico our general has
promised me that i shall soon be a
colonel and you lieutenant will doubt-
less become a major

  lieutenant calderas a youth of not
more than twenty-three stroked his in-
cipient mustache with an air of mili-
tary pride

  how many rifles are to come next
time captain bustanobo

  our great and good friend prom-
ises not less than four thousand he
will even try to get six thousand but
he informs our general that he is
obliged to buy with great care through
many agents and in small lots that he

may not excite suspicion within a
few months we shall doubtless have
fifty thousand rifles and that with the
valor that our men exhibit will be
plenty to make calvoras president of
mexico me i shall doubtless be a
general of division by that time but
lieutenant have you seen to it that a
close watch is kept

  i have been on the alert my cap-
tain i will call sergeant penumbra
and he shall tell you what he is doing
pass word for sergeant penumbra
the name was-uttered in tones loud
enough to be heard at a distance soon
a little brown man came running up
though he rubbed his eyes as he came

  sergeant demanded the lieutenant
you have kept vigilant watch over the
water 

  my men have done so excellent
lieutenant always two have remained
standing since dark begun their eyes
turned out on the sea they have seen
no ship of any kind

  it is well sergeant declared the
lieutenant faithfully serve the new
republic of calvoras and you shall be
rewarded you may become a lieu-
tenant like myself if you detect the
coming of such a ship and report it in
time think what it will mean to be
a gentleman in the new and glorious
republic

  never doubt my alertness my lieu-
tenant begged sergeant penumbra sa-
luting and retiring when he received the
signal

 when a mexican knows that an
enemy is near he is a marvel of watch-
fulness whispered carrick in flem-
ings ear but sometimes the mexican
soldier is found napping on his post
that sergeant and his men have surely
been making up some arrears in sleep
may the whole command here sleep
forever was the doctors pious wish

  farther on a group of half a dozen
soldiers played cards almost silently
by the light of a second fire many
li shoons nine lives



men of the command wrapped in their
tattered rags were now sound asleep
under the stars

  there is little to be feared from this
sleepy lot asserted the hound
come we will move around them and
on toward mattanegua we must
learn if the budsibu is at anchor in the
bay we already have a fairly good
idea of how li shoon if he be here
has managed to gain asylum in this
pirates nest of a closed port he is
spending a part of his wicked plun-
derings in bringing in munitions of war
to calvoras it is a clever way of
gaining the hiding place and protection
that he needs

  with infinite care the hound picked
his way around the camp under the
deep shade of the trees but on the
northern side of the camp the two
americans despite their stealth made
slight sounds that reached the ears of
two mexican sentries this brown
pair after listening for an instant
slipped silently on their bare feet be-
hind two tree trunks carrick and
fleming passed between the trees just
another instant and rifle butts de-
scended on their heads both men
pitched forward to the earth half-
stunned

  alerta al numero sierte bawled
both sentries at once it was their
way of summoning help for post no
 two rifle bolts clicked ominously
and two rifle muzzles were pressed
against the two dismayed captives

  in the camp confused murmurs fol-
lowed half a dozen soldiers ran up
at once others could be heard fol-
lowing with instant death as their
portion in case of resistance carrick
and fleming wisely made no effort to
draw their automatics had they been
on their feet they would have opened
vigorous fire then taken to their heels

  ah we have prisoners and ameri-
canos at that cried captain busta-
nobo turning the rays of a lantern on

the captives these must be they for
whom we were told to watch

  that is hardly likely my captain
since they did not come by ship in-
terposed lieutenant calderas gravely
but none the less they are ameri-
canos and our brave general loves that
breed so well that he sends them imme-
diately to heaven

  guard the prisoners and kill them
if they attempt to escape ordered cap-
tain bustanobo briskly

  you are taking a lot of trouble to
be sure of securing two unarmed men
scoffed carrick in spanish

  search them commanded busta-
nobo a dozen eager hands were
stretched forth at once as though the
soldiers hoped to discover real loot
of course the automatics and extra
magazines as well as the cartridges
were speedily brought to light

  lieutenant cried bustanobo joy-
ously you and i have long craved just
such excellent revolvers they are
ours now and men who lied to us
about being unarmed will prove no
more truthful in anything i shall ask
them no questions but will take them
at once to our brave general lieu-
tenant you will take command of the
camp and you will keep as close look-
out as before against the coming of the
expected ship sergeant take a guard
of ten men and stand ready to shoot the
prisoners at any sign pf a wish to
escape march

  forward the little procession went
what carrick and fleming may have
said under their breaths does not mat-
ter much through a seemingly endless
jungle they finally arrived upon the
semblance of a road which became
somewhat better as the party came
within sight of the lights of the little
port of mattanegua now the arrest
party passed a few outpost guards
at frequent intervals then down
through a street the captors marched
their prisoners halting before a large


detective story magazine

two-story white building before which
stood at least a dozen armed guards
these saluted bustanobos party per-
mitting them to enter an oblong court-
yard within bustanobo passed in
through a guarded door but soon reap-
peared to say

  the prisoners will follow me
under his guidance carrick and his
friend were led into a corridor and
through the second door to the right
in that room stood two young officers
while a man of fifty-five seated at a
table with a bottle and wineglasses at
his elbow turned to scowl at the pris-
oners

 welcome my most excellent
friends exclaimed an unctuous voice
and li shoon in richest chinese garb
appeared in a doorway

chapter xi

calvoras takes the helm

lowr demanded general calvoras
in a somewhat thick voice then
these are the two americans whom you
hoped to catch doctor li

  the very pair cried the interna-
tional criminal joyously they are the
two american secret-service agents
from whom you have most to fear
they have penetrated the secret of your
source of supply in munitions of war
general you will know what to do with
them

  i shall have them shot within sixty
seconds exclaimed calvoras wrath-
fully captain bustanobo you have
heard my pleasure 

  it shall be done at once my general
as you say assented the captain

  i beg you to let them remain for a
moment pleaded li shoon in sweet-
est spanish carrick fleming you
are balm against the soreness of my
eyes in my darkest moments i knew
that this time would come it was
promised me by hop how my sooth-

sayer i shall reward him for this
prophecy which has come true
beginning with his address to the
hapless prisoners li had dropped into
english he now continued

  you two should have known that
you could not long hope to baffle me
you had your brief triumphs yet they
lasted but moments after all and
now all the score is settled

  li spoke carrick steadily you
can send me to death but i can take
you with us your yacht is under the
guns of these miscreants in seven
words i can inform this make-believe
general that your yacht contains hid-
den away carefully yet discoverable
millions in gold coin that you have
stolen from ships that you have after-
ward sunk this braggart bogus sol-
dier will forgive you your villainies all
except the fact of your concealing from
him the enormous stores of gold coin
that you have on the budzibu when
he hears of the gold he will kill you
either before or after he has seized the
gold for which he will hunt like a rat
on the scent of grain unless you can
save us li you are done for as surely
as we are think are your wits
quick can you save our hides and
your own

  do you think im fool enough to
carry the coin on the yacht taunted
li that would be more stupid than
to smoke in a powder mill

  calvoras after listening in a stupid
noncomprehending way drained an-
other glass of wine then rose heavily to
his feet breaking in in spanish

  i understand doctor li shoon that
you are talking over old grudges let
it be so i will leave you alone for a
while then i will send my file of sol-
diers to see that these scoundrelly
americanos are taken out and shot a
quick shooting doctor li always saves
bother

  the door closed and the three were
alone had carrick wished he could
li shoons nine lives



have sprung upon this odious china-
man and killed him with his own hands
li was an outlaw without rights before
man but the hounds mind was work-
ing fast along other lines

  as if he realized his own danger li
glided to another door clapping his
hands smartly in came a dozen chi-
nese led by ming executioner to the
ui kwoon ah-how

  amuse these gentlemen said li in
english but the gesture was enough
accompanying their leaders evil smile
at a guttural word from ming the yel-
low assistants seized upon both ameri-
cans immediately there began a series
of horrible arm twisting and straining
of joints fleming had the hardest
work of his life in keeping his groans
back he felt like yelling hysterically
great drops of cold sweat stood out
all over his forehead his cheeks his
entire body carricks face was more
immobile he looked almost calm under
the fiendish torture though his soul
writhed under every wrench but car-
ricks was the more imperturbable na-
ture besides he had had years of ex-
perience in the oriental world

  at a word from ming the torture
stopped at another word three of the
chinese left the room soon returning
with implements of torture that made
the comprehending carrick shudder
visibly

  ah you know what is coming
said li shoon smiling sweetly i al-
ways strive to give the best of my
hospitality and after these machines
i have others that provide even more
amusement oh we shall have a rare
night of it when it is all over then
general calvoras may send his firing
squad in with the dessert if he then
thinks it worth while

  yet even as ming superintended the
sorting and preparation of the torture
machines a heavy tread sounded at the
door in strode a mexican captain

  sa ds

in heavy boots followed by a sergeant
and eight barefooted privates all
armed with rifles

  it is by general calvoras orders
that i take these prisoners from you
doctor he said with a courteous bow
they are to be shot at once

  but i am not through li protested
shrilly

  that i regret to hear but you will
understand that i can only obey my
generals orders said the captain cour-
teously sergeant take the prisoners
march

  quivering with rage at being so
coolly deprived of his prized prey li
shoon moved swiftly from the room
the sergeant and his squad surround-
ing fleming and carrick marched them
out of the building through the court-
yard and up the principal thoroughfare
of mattanegua

  shooting is a welcome relief from
what was to hve been offered us
muttered carrick i have had many
meetings with li but never saw him
in such a fiendish mood as he was to-
night

  he will probably have the orders re-
voked suggested fleming a mes-
senger with altered orders is likely to
overtake us at any moment

  as he spoke the chemist tried to
glance backward down the poorly
lighted street but a soldier jabbed him
with a bayonet forcing him to keep his
eyes ahead as the squad moved
along mexican rebels and the popu-
lace smoked indolently in the streets
hardly turning their heads to gaze after
such a familiar scene as an execution
party

  past the town and out into the woods
the mexican captain marched his party
at last he halted in a grove of tall trees

  you will be tied each to a tree
trunk gentlemen he announced and
four men will hold rifles against each
of your chests death should be in-

under the shower of gold

i have a few courteous words cap-
tain that i would like to say to you
and your men carrick replied gravely

  courteous words to executioners
are rare gentlemen said the rebel cap-
tain fondling his mustache

  what i wish to say carrick went
on is that i appreciate the fact that
you are soldiers therefore you must
obey your orders and i bear you no
ill will i have one request to make
and that is that you take full pains to
make our deaths instantaneous i am
going to reward you for doing it for i
have gifts that our first captors over-
looked i have with me twelve hun-
dred dollars in american gold worth
nearly twenty-eight hundred dollars in
mexican silver and worth more than
a shipload of your paper currency i
propose captain that this gold shall go
to you and your soldiers

  as he spoke carrick fumbled dex-
terously with his clothing in a-twin-
kling then he brought forth his money
belt his nimble fingers ran along the
catches over the pockets opening them

  some of this money is in coin and
some in american gold notes which
are as good as gold coin at any bank
in the world captain i propose to
give your men a merry scramble for
it

  as he spoke carrick swiftly took
hold of the belt by one end twirled
it and hurled it far into the bushes

  as the belt flew a golden shower of
coins could be heard dropping to the
earth gold notes fluttered against the
faces of some of the soldiers as with
stifled cries they raced after the for-
tune nor could even the captain resist
the lure these mexicans had been too

jpng without real money and on scant
food

  weve about seven seconds whis-
pered carrick striking flemings arm
follow me like a streak

  but fleming dallied for at least four
of the precious seven seconds he had
noted that several of the soldiers had
dropped their rifles to join in the hot
scramble after the money like a
hawk the chemist pounced upon the
three nearest rifles and also a ban-
dolier of cartridges that one of the sol-
diers had carried on his arm then
the doctor fled

  good work and a happy thought
panted carrick as he relieved fleming
of two of the rifles now we can
at least die fighting

  but the fugitives were out of sight
ere the mexican rebel captain realized
he was a victim of trickery while still
searching nervously for coins or notes
he called to his men to look after the
prisoners each eager soldier how-
ever left obedience to be rendered by
his fellows when the captain finally
by the use of many curses brought his
soldiers to their senses the captives had
long vanished and leaving not so much
as a guiding sound

  again the master hound had to have
recourse to the stars when he could
espy them through the thick treetops
he took a generally northerly course
through the thick forest in which there
was not a trace of a path to be found

  behind them two rifle volleys crack-
led out fleming halted for a moment
to chuckle noiselessly

  i know our mexican neighbors well
enough to know what is happening and
will happen he whispered to fleming
the captain and his men have fired
that they may be able to back up the
tale they are going to tell of the execu-
tion they will even lay out two
mounds then go back and report that
we are dead but they will search that
li shoons nine lives



forest until no more money can be
found captain and men will hold
their tongues as to what really hap-
pened for they possess a secret that
would hang them all

  more deliberately now the hound
led the way through the forest listen-
ing all the time when he halted again
it was to say

  fleming the snatching of these
rifles and the cartridges was a stroke
of genius at the worst we fear no
one now for we can go down giving as
good as we get

  it was soon plain that to the north
of mattanegua at least where the for-
est ran that no rebel outposts had been
stationed carrick after half an hour
of flight walked with lefes caution until
he heard the noise of an automobile
moving slowly somewhere to the south-
east of them he halted to listen

  there must be a road parallel with
our course fleming whispered that
car is coming our way and seems likely
to pass us within a stones throw
getting his bearings carrick led the
way forward once more shaping his
course so as to approach gradually the
road that he believed to lie to the east
of them

  its a poor enough road judging by
the cars noise fleming whispered as
the car passed them to the eastward
going north i wonder who can have
a car over here

  a minute later the car stopped car-
rick though he did not halt moved
with greater stealth an example that
the chemist at once imitated soon
they heard the murmur of voices dead
ahead and next the unctuous tones
of doctor li shoon came to them the
wretch was talking in english pre-
sumably that no passing mexican
should understand li preferred when
useful the modern tongues to chinese

  i brought you here weng li was
explaining as the americans drew

near that there might be no danger
of calvoras knowing what i have to
say though they apparently under-
stand only spanish i am always suspi-
cious that some of the generals officers
may know too much english for our
good while i do not expect to die i
am always aware that fate may be
about to press the cup to my lips i
have good news-wonderful we now
have four and a half million dollars in
gold coin you know where it is hid-
den

  yet i could not go to it objected
weng-yu

  i am coming to that li went on
with a wave of his hands but the
news you know that sing yen just
came ashore from the yacht with a
wireless telegram for me it was sent
from san francisco in our chinese
code that not a soul in the world could
read outside of the ui kwoon ah-how
and that code message-it is exhilarat-
ing barely more than a hundred miles
to the south of here the steamer sea
king is proceeding slowly north against
difficulties with her machinery she
has wirelessed san diego for aid
though she can keep slowly under way
unless a further break occurs in her
machinery and the san francisco
newspapers express grave concern for
the sea king carries in her strong room
the sum of eight million dollars in gold
think of it weng

  truly the thought is enough to
drive one out of his mind quivered
weng-yu that with four and a half
millions already hidden is one-fourth
of the whole sum needed to launch the
ui kwoon ah-how on its glorious work
of subduing all of asia to chinese
rule

  we would have had the entire fifty
millions ere this had it not been for
that dog of a carrick and his hardly
less dangerous friend fleming ut-
tered li bitterly the gods of our an-


detective story magazine

cestors be praised that both of the med-
dlesome americans now sleep in their
last beds by to-morrow forenoon
weng that eight millions should be
ours and all traces of our work lost
under the waves the sea king carries
fifty passengers as well but what are
fifty more lives when the glory of ui
kwoon ah-how thrills our hearts

  nothing whatever declared weng-
yu snapping his fingers i would kill
all on the american continent to see
the ui kwoon triumph

  there was a third in the group-
ming but that mongol stood by in
grave silence his were only the deeds
of blood not his to use his brain but
his hideous tools

  yet the gods of our ancestors may
call me before my work is done as i
would see it li shoon continued mus-
ingly i have had that thought for
though i have boasted of possessing
nine lives the number may be nearly
run therefore weng i am giving
you now to be hidden securely a copy
of my map showing where the four
millions and a half in gold are hidden
you have seen the spot but have not
followed the navigating map closely
you know the little bay when you see
it six miles below cape marca on the
coast of lower california you know
as well the three trees whose trunks
form a triangle yet you could not
reach the spot again with surety with-
out this map if the gods put the cup
to my lips then you will go there and
get the hidden gold as well as that
which is to be taken from the sea king
to-morrow you know what is to be
done with it you know also that you
are to succeed me as head of the ui
kwoon

  weng-yu stretched forth his hand to
receive the precious paper before his
fingers could close upon it it was
snatched away by donald carrick who
sprang from behind a tree

chapter xiii

mexico is one huge trap

the gods have sent your spirit back
to torment me gasped li shoon
for an instant lis face was as near
pallid as a chinamans may be

  but the click of a bolt as fleming
cocked one of the rifles and stood back
to cover the yellow trio was accom-
panied by the chemists jeering retort
spirits dont use rifles at least i
never heard of a case

  having tucked away the map car-
rick too presented the muzzle of a rifle
for the inspection of the momentarily
baffled ones

  but you two were shot protested
li his voice still a bit shaky it was
difficult indeed for him to overcome
his belief that the hound and the chem-
ist had been duly executed

  we came to life again said car-
rick briefly we came back long
enough to have our reckoning with you
doctor li of course you are aware that
you are an outlawed man and there-
fore any mans lawful prey

  in america perhaps but not around
mattanegua li retorted mockingly
he had found his nerve again though
neither he nor his companions ventured
to dash against rifles held by men whom
they knew to be full of resolution

  mexican rebel law could have no
terrors for me declared the hound
coolly doctor li have you any rea-
sons to offer why i should not kill
you

  only that you do not dare kill me
mocked li shoon a single shot and
you will bring down upon you the sol-
diers-my friends i will make you a
proposition give me back the map
and i will let you go

  a wonderful favor  exclaimed the
master hound with biting irony you
will let us go-where we are hun-
dreds of miles from our own country
and all the mexicans for scores of
li shoons nine lives



miles obey calvoras wherever we go
if discovered we are killed it would
take us weeks even if not caught to
walk to our own country and safety

  is it as bad as that queried li
with huge satisfaction you did not
follow me by sea but came overland
then truly you may as well drop your
rifles and ride back with us to mat-
tanegua you can only be shot to
death therefore why not be done with
it

  fleming step back about six paces
and cover these wretches  commanded
carrick calmly if one of them stirs
kill him do not mind the noise of the
shot and for preference kill li
shoon

  to do so will afford me great pleas-
ure replied the chemist coolly

  carrick darted east to the road
there at the edge he found the car
moreover in the tool kit he found a
file and a monkey wrench for a brief
time he filed industriously against the
steering rod of the motor car then
adjusting the wrench tightly to the rod
he snapped it

  that is all announced carrick
coming back to where his friend held
the yellow trio at bay li you and
your friends will walk back to mat-
tanegua whoever attempts to follow
us will be killed by daylight if we
have good fortune we can be a dozen
miles from here and farther in the
jungle doctor li in the patter of this
country adios

  at a run carrick and his friend dis-
appeared going northeast after some
three minutes of running carrick
halted abruptly throwing himself to the
earth where he listened with his ear
against the ground while fleming
peered behind him into the depths of
the forest through which they had
come

  i do not believe we are being fol-
lowed the hound whispered in his
friends ear now we will see if we

can find the spot on the coast for which
we should aim

  for carrick in landing had given
orders that the vulcan should attempt
to pick them up at a point some miles
north of mattanegua instead of south
of it

  shaping his course once more by the
stars carrick trudged on ahead flem-
ing following some dozen feet to the
rear the latter carried two of the
three rifles carrick wore the bandolier
of reserve cartridges

  despite the season it was almost
stiflingly hot in here among the trees
both men were bathed in perspiration
by the time they reached the coast at
the point for which the hound had
aimed

  this cannot be the place carrick
murmured we are too far south
probably by at least two miles come
in under the trees again it would not
do to walk on the beach

  so they continued on for nearly an
hour more then through the trees
they beheld a little bay lighted only by
the stars

  there is our place carrick mur-
mured we will go down to the edge
of the trees and wait if you are as
footsore as i am the rest will be wel-
come to you	- j

 welcome indeed murmured
fleming

  still in the lead carrick had not
more than emerged from under the
trees when half a dozen mexican rebel
soldiers leaped to their feet aiming
their rifles

  para quien vivet halt who
goes there came the sharp hail

  company halt called carrick de-
liberately doctor fleming just in
time called company halt

  fleming made noise enough with his
own feet to give some idea of men halt-
ing under the trees from the beach
he was invisible

 put down your guns my men


detective story magazine

ordered carrick confidently you are
outnumbered by an american naval
party you do not wish to be wiped
out then attempt no resistance
obey my orders and your lives shall be
spared

  as the rebel soldiers hesitated car-
rick motioned impatiently frowning as
though he could not credit such stub-
bornness

  if you do not at once drop your
rifles my men will fire and sweep you
from the earth he cried angrily still
in spanish have none of you men
families or sweethearts that you would
throw your lives away down with
your rifles on the ground now
march away from your pieces hands
up that is right halt

  sheer bluff had won cowed the
mexicans had obeyed they now stood
with the nearest a hundred feet distant
from his rifle

  lieutenant hailed carrick sharply

  aye aye sir from the chemist

  send the sergeant down here to bind
these men

  aye aye sir

  then as the chemist appeared car-
rick added

  you can tie their wrists behind them
with their own sashes and leave ends
sufficient to tie them to the trunks of
small trees

  doctor fleming accomplished that
with a speed born of some knowledge
of the art of tying he soon had the
men tightly lashed

  now march commanded carrick
leading the way while fleming with
rifle at the ready brought up the rear
fully six hundred feet up the wooded
slope the men were led then lashed to
trees

  it will be of equal value to gag these
men carrick declared so the gagging
was accomplished by cutting pieces
from the mens clothes and stuffing into
their mouths the tying being done with
knotted strips cut from their jackets

patiently as dumb animals these men
submitted preferring the humiliation to
the loss of their lives

  one doesnt feel pleasant about de-
spoiling these poverty-stricken fellows
of their only clothing murmured car-
rick in english fleming have you
any gold pieces

  a few admitted the chemist -

  then slip one into the trousers
pocket of each prisoner carrick
begged next adding in spanish his apol-
ogies to the men and informing them
that the gold was to be used in provid-
ing themselves with whole clothing

  the task ended carrick striking and
shading a match glanced at his watch

  it lacks but two hours of daylight
he announced if we are to escape
after all we have but little time in
which to do it

  down the slope they ran but soon
slowed down going on tiptoe as they
heard some body of men moving
through the forest

  li must have got back and given
the alarm whispered carrick if so
and if this be a searching or relief
party and our gagged friends are
found then all we can do is to die
game

  dropping to the ground moving the
three rifles before them and placing
the bandolier so that either could reach
for reserve cartridges the masted
hound and the chemist awaited devel-
opments

  up in the forest above could bef heard
not very plainly the sounds made by
moving bare feet through the under-
growth

  theyre halting now whispered
carrick if they try to communicate
with the missing outpost at this point
guess what is going to become of us

  i never bet on sure things doctor
fleming replied grimly

  picture to yourself how the tied and
gagged soldiers are struggling to free
themselves that they may give the alarm
li shoons nine lives	

at once and they know the direction
that we took

  mexico is one huge trap sighed
the doctor easy to get into but hard
to get out

chapter xiv

the sea tragedy staged

the movements of the prowling party
changed in direction twenty min-
utes later some thirty rebel soldiers led
by a young lieutenant came out on the
beach from a point to the northward
they marched down halting on about
the spot where the two americans had
captured the rebel outpost with them
was a figure more portly than is com-
mon in mexico

  you said there was an outpost here
hinted the voice of li shoon

  they were posted here before dark
replied the lieutenant but they are
new men not veteran soldiers it is
plain that the rascals finding it near-
ing daylight decided that their duty
was done they have returned to mat-
tanegua or else they have stolen into
the woods to sleep

  the discarded half dozen rifles and
bandoliers would have given a hint to
the searchers but fortunately fleming
some minutes before had crawled out
and brought these things to the spot
occupied by carrick and himself the
two friends now listened and watched
breathlessly ready for any clash that
might come

  we are wasting time said the lieu-
tenant indolently your americano
fugitives are making fast time through
the forest while we linger here
march

  away drilled the column li shoon
despite his size keeping tirelessly with
them

  there will be no more searchers here
now proclaimed carrick with a sigh
of relief we must leave li to attend
to his affairs and give all our attention

 to our own you might stay here
 though with the arsenal

   exploring an inside pocket carrick
 on the beach brought forth a small
 electric flash light forming a shield-
 ing cone with his hands the hound
 flashed the light seaward just seven
 times he waited a few seconds then
 flashed the light seven more times

   after that he seated himself on the
 sands ten minutes went by ere he
 could discern any answer to his signals
 then something merely dark and vague
 appeared on the water beyond that
 something came nearer and nearer re-
 solving itself into a swift launch pro-
 pelled by a noiseless petroleum engine
 it glided in like a thing of mystery to
 where carrick stood on the beach wav-
 ing his arms some forty feet from the
 shore it lay to on account of shallow
 water

   whos in charge hailed carrick
 in a hoarse whisper

i kerrigan sir are you ready
more than ready came the
hounds heartfelt answer

   over from the launch sprang two
 barefooted sailors their trousers rolled
 up for wading

   take these rifles and bandoliers
 first  whispered carrick they are
 souvenirs the doctor and i have been
 collecting to-night

   with flemings help the sailors car-
 ried the rifles and bandoliers to the
 launch then back they came lifting
 the two adventurers and bearing them
 dry shod to seats at the stern of the
 launch as the two sailors sprang in
 the launch turned and put silently out
 to sea

  and now observed the hound
 producing pipe and pouch i propose
 to enjoy a smoke

   the doctor preferred to roll a ciga-
 rette they lijt up with shielded
 matches keeping their faces turned
 westward that the glows might not at-
 tract attention from shore


detective story magazine

  straight out for five miles directed
the hound then return to ship

  that was done in a little more than
an hour carrick and doctor fleming
found themselves ascending the side
gangway of the vulcan while captain
mulford stood on deck to receive them
the yacht lay in a little indentation of
the coast line some miles south of mat-
tanegua she had a single anchor out
at a spot where a curving projecting
wooded arm of land served to shield
her from direct observation from the
sea

  if youve no immediate instructions
sir will you be good enough to come
into my cabin  requested captain mul-
ford by the time the two friends had
seated themselves there the skipper
handed carrick a sheet of paper on
which were written a lot of gibberishy
words

  whats this smiled carrick as he
read  quong king lee sing chui mien
sen- 

  thats a chinese wireless isnt it
asked captain mulford our operator
took it down some time after you went
ashore

  it was intended for the operator
on the budsibu laughed the hound
and he received it as i happened to
hear this wireless was sent from san
francisco probably and i was behind
its being sent these words have a
chinese formation but theyre code not
straight chinese this code messags
informed li that the sea king par-
tially disabled is coming up the coast
needing help and the further informa-
tion that she carries eight million in
gold in her strong room but the gold
isnt there the captain of the sea
king has his own orders furnished in
the navy code and knows just what
he is to do li shoon will attempt
to board him this coming morning and
we shall be at hand also

  after looking at his watch carrick
exchanged a few words with the vul-

cans wireless man next with a cabin
steward on duty then he and fleming
went to their own cabin where they lay
down in their berths without removing
more than coats and shoes

  at a few minutes after eight the
wireless man knocked on the door
springing up the hound threw the
door open

  the sea king is wirelessing san
diego that her machinery is becoming
more and more useless sir and to rush
a tug to her the operator reported
here is the message as i took it down
how far south is the sea king
carrick asked glancing at the paper

  twejve miles to the southard sir
and making not more than four miles
an hour

  has the budzibu gone south yet
shes not been sighted sir and must
be still in mattanegua bay

  theres time to spare then said
carrick to his friend and hastened out
to find captain mulford and give direc-
tions on shore in the top of one
of the tallest trees on the projecting
arm of land that hid the vulcan a quar-
termaster and a sailor kept vigilant
watch

  his conference with captain mulford
finished carrick returned to his cabin
selecting changes of clothing from the
baggage he had brought on board then
he hastened to one of the baths the
doctor to another

  half an hour later as they were
dressing in their cabin carrick heard
hurried steps on the deck overhead fol-
lowed by sounds of hoisting a launch
that had been waiting tc bring the quar-
termaster and sailor back

  the budsibu has started south said
the hound you may depend upon
that

  once on deck however they learned
that li shoons pirate craft had only
appeared outside of mattanegua bay
the launch had returned to shore with
mr olney third officer who went to
li shoons nine lives



the edge of the land it was an hour
later when he reappeared signaling for
the launch olney came on board re-
porting 

  the budsibu is now steaming south
at about eight miles an hour

  at a nod from carrick the launch
was once more hoisted on board a
machinist stood by the donkey engine
ready to begin hoisting the anchor as
soon as the signal should be given just
the barest glimpse of the sumatran
yacht was had after a while then
she passed wholly out of sight car-
rick and fleming now took up their
post at the door of the wireless room

  another age passed ere the operator
turned to say

  message flying

  his pencil traveled over the paper
as he listened at last he leaned side-
ways to hand carrick this message
taken from the air

   the master of the sea king will lie to and
prepare to receive a boarding party he will
keep all passengers and all but two of his
crew between decks

  the message came very weakly sir
reported the operator to the flushed
frowning hound

  thats because li shoon doesnt
want the message to travel far enough
to attract any attention carrick an-
swered

  again the operators pencil touched
paper he handed over the sheet com-
menting 

  evidently the reply from the sea
king

  this message read tersely

   why the devil should i lie to for boarders

  the sea kings master will soon
learn was carricks grim word

  the answer flashed back

  because we carry cannon which you will
see our crew uncovering if you dont lie
to immediately we shall be obliged to sink
you with your crew and passengers if you
have any regard for the lives intrusted to
you you will obey at once you are deal-
ing with mexicans who will spare or de-

stroy you as you merit will you obey or
shall we open a fire that will send you to
the bottom in five minutes 

 back from the master of the sea
king came the response

  dont fire have women and children on
board will put crew and passengers be-
low hatches and await boarding party

  running forward carrick called to
captain mulford

  time to get the anchor up sir and
be under way at once full speed south
and straight to the budsibu 

  in a wonderfully short time the vul-
can was under way passing out of the
little inlet and out upon the broad
waters of the pacific

  see if there are any more messages
fleming called the hound but the
chemist swiftly returned with a negative
answer

  racing like a deer the vulcan was
destined to come up within effective
distance within twelve minutes and
now an unexpected thing happened for
at a nod from carrick mr olney
stepped forward with a letter which he
handed captain mulford that skipper
read and was astounded

  its all right mr olney he ex-
claimed glancing up from the letter
this order informs me that yeure
ensign olney united states navy and
that the five seamen you brought aboard
are united states navy seamen fur-
ther that when you decide to take com-
mand of this craft temporarily i am to
take your orders until the crisis is over
go ahead sir i shall be up on the
bridge prepared to cary out any order
i may receive from you

  under olneys crisp orders the for-
ward hatch was thrown open and tackie
swung onto a  inch naval gun that
all on board knew was there for the
track had been laid on the deck days
before with precision the gun was
swung upward and laid on the track
olneys five naval seamen aided by the
yachts sailors pushed the gun to posi-

tion over the port bow all was made
secure the breech opened and a shell
rammed home with closed breech
once more olney stood by with field
glass while a naval gunner took obser-
vations through the sights

  three points to starboard sir ol-
ney shouted to the bridge afterward
he added and now sir stand in
more toward shore

  every minute brought the vulcan
closer to the spot where the budzibu
lay to while half a mile to the south-
west of her the sea king lay motion-
less on the waters two-thirds of the
way from the sumatran yacht to the
liner two launches rode the water
they contained a total of some fifty
men lascars and chinese as it after-
ward proved carrick and fleming
could realize the way the sea kings
decks would run blood to the scuppers
if once this piratical crew got foothold
on board

  so far the vulcan had approached
without discovery so intent were all of
li shoons men on the eight-million-
dollar prey that they believe the sea
king to be

  but now a man in one of the launches
caught sight of the racing rescuing
vulcan and stood up in the launch sig-
naling violently to the budzibu 

chapter xv

treasure-trove

a naval battle between us and the
sumatran cried doctor fleming
athrill with the pepperish prospect

  boom sounded the vulcans gun a
few seconds later the watchers saw
the shell strike one of the budsibus
launches there was a cloud of smoke
a geyser of salt water then the launch
vanished blown to atoms while her late
crew struggled in the water

  boom that shot struck fifty feet
astern of the second launch doing no
harm wincing ensign olney fired a

third shell the second launch after
a few seconds had followed the first

  go in to rescue the men pirates
though they are olney shouted to-
ward the bridge at the same time the
ensign kept his gaze toward the bud-
sibu for he could see that she mounted
two nine-pounder guns forward and an
effective shell from either of these
would be enough to sink the unarmored
vidcan

  carrick at the port rail a little be-
hind the gunners held glasses to his
eyes as did fleming on the deck for-
ward the could make out both li
shoon and weng-yu-could even read
the astounded expressions on their yel-
low faces ten feet behind them stood

ming

  t-

  and then the all-but-incredible thing
happened the budzibu as though re-
alizing the hopelessness of conflict
against the vulcans  swung around
her bow away from the gallant intru-
der as though declining conflict

  its strange that one of li shoons
temper should prefer capture gasped
the hound

  maybe he doesnt hinted the chem-
ist

  butt he has pointed his guns away
from us

  watch him doctor li is a man of
deadly resource

  apparently ensign olneys suspi-
cions too had been aroused for he
abandoned his humane purpose of res-
cuing the launches crews and ordered
another change in the vulcans course

  what can li simoon do carrick
wondered as he saw the  trained on
the sumatran yacht

  he wont keep us guessing long
fleming ventured nor did his guess go
astray

  a minute of inaction passed-a min-
ute of the kind that lives ever afterward
in mens minds then a tremendous
half-muffled roar shook the air
through the forward deck of the
li shoons nine lives



budzibu belched a crater of flame and
smoke pitching like a living thing in
the death throe the budzibu began set-
tling by the head

  run in as close as you dare sir to
rescue survivors shouted ensign ol-
ney

  ahead forged the vulcan yet before
she arrived the budzibu had vanished
from sight under the waters

  not even my gun could have worked
half the havoc of that internal explo-
sion gasped olney turning to carrick
your chinese prince of crime must
have given thorough thought to mining
a ship like that

  while the sea king still lay to the
vulcan searched in vain for trace of a
single survivor either from the budzibu
or her two launches the destruction
had been complete lis pirates know-
ing well their fate at the laws hands
if caught had preferred to drown all
the mystery of master and owner of
the yachts strange charter had gone

down with the budzibu
             k

  li shoon has at last given up by
his own hand his ninth and last life
uttered donald carrick solemnly

  when all chance of saving survivors
had been given up the vulcan ran over
alongside the sea king lying to at a
afe interval to be greeted with tumul-
tuous cheers from the liner

  i want to tell you captain bick-
ford that you did your part in a mag-
nificent manner donald carrick
shouted through a megaphone to the
sea kings skipper you will find
yourself well though not sufficiently re-
warded by the blue stack company
when you reach frisco you will now
of course proceed on your way under
the speed you prefer

  with another interchange of cheers
and much blowing of whistles the sea
king which really carried no gold at all
in her strong room and which had
acted under secret naval instructions

altered to a course farther offshore and
proceeded on her homeward way

  the vulcan kept somewhat inshore
going at full speed until she overhauled
a mexican coastwise fishing smack a
few miles north of mattanegua to
the master of that little craft carrick
shouted information as to where the
half dozen soldiers of calvoras rebel
outpost would be found tied to the
trees

  from there a nearly record run was
made to the spot indicated on li
shoons map between the aid fur-
nished by that document and what he
had overheard in the talk between li
and weng-yu carrick was occupied but
a few hours in finding an artificial cave
wonderfully constructed and concealed
in which was found intact the hoard
of four and a half million dollars taken
from the halcyon and the spokane
this money was transferred to the
vulcan and started on the way to its
rightful owners in san francisco

  in san francisco the ever-active re-
porters got wind of enough of the story
so that the rest of it was given out at
the blue stack line offices over the
united states and the world flashed the
news that doctor lis ninth and last life
had been offered up and canceled by li
himself

  carrick and fleming did not linger in
the city of the golden gate after set-
tling their financial affairs with the blue
stack company they hastened east

  on the day of his arrival in new
york doctor john fleming was joy-
fully able to confide to his friend his
hour-new marriage to miss sylvia dor-
rance

  i shall not again have to fear for
her safety in connection with doctor
li fleming declared with a heartfelt
sigh

  for any other human beings tragic
death i might feel sorrow donald car-
rick answered li shoons death un-

der even more terrible circumstances
can only fill me with entire satisfaction
will the ui kwoon ah-how live
after this  inquired the doctor

it may replied the master hound

but it will be confined to china only
the evil genius of a li shoon could
make the ui kwoon a world-wide men-
ace and there is but one doctor li born
in a thousand years

japs wary of death phone numbers

it is interesting to find science and superstition locking horns in connection with
telephones in japan it is not strange to find convenience cutting a figure
in the choice of numbers of instruments a single-figure phone sells in tokyo
for from eight hundred to one thousand yen-three hundred and ninety to four
hundred and ninety dollars per year the luckiest number in the estima-
tion of business men is eight because the character for it spreads downward
and suggests the idea of gathering in prosperity no  is also a lucky num-
ber because children are presented at shinto shrines on their third fifth and
seventh birthdays indeed odd numbers are lucky three-figure numbers are
not objectionable if they are easy to remember like  or  the most un-
lucky numbers are  and  because the former may be pronounced shini
which means to die and the latter may be pronounced shiku which means
death and suffering therefore it is said that these numbers are avoided
by individuals and are generally taken by government officers schools police
stations and other invincible institutions

    another interesting point not of superstition but of convenience rather of
inconvenience is the fact that numbers are not abbreviated as in america but
are always given in full but the japanese will doubtless before long see the
time-saving elements in saying one two three four instead of saying one
thousand two hundred and thirty-four as yet they are not in a great hurry

back in the toils

raptured as he was preparing to enter the home of george p royster in
sacramento california john adams has been identified as a professional
burglar who has already served three different sentences for robbery since
 he has spent practically all of the time behind prison bars

    when taken before max p fisher identification expert adams was recog-
nized at a glance as the burglar who was captured in sacramento in  by de-
tectives ryan and kramer and policeman koening after he had burglarized the

sergeant ryan

the inspector in charge of the de-
tective bureau at police head-
quarters was talking to half a
dozen reporters and at the
same time was exchanging a dress coat
for one of dark blue which was not
part of a uniform though suggestive
of it

  i dont know any more about this
case than you do he was saying id
been to a theater and was eating sup-
per afterward when i got word of it
the report that came to me was that
a man named prescott carroll had been
arrested for the murder of oliver
brundage-ollie brundage you all
know him

  the reporters nodded the name
and fame of ollie brundage were quite
familiar to them he was a young man
of good family a bachelor and club-
man who managed to move in the
highest society without any visible
means of support they also knew
carroll who had gone out of journal-
ism into literature eight or ten years
before and had won a certain measure
of recognition

  the arrest was made by a patrol-
man and detective hines of my staff
continued the inspector it seems
that carroll knocked brundage down
with a sand club or something of that
kind and was going through his pock-
ets it was on west seventy-eighth

street just opposite the new church
the prisoner was taken to the station
house but i sent word to have him
brought down here brundages body
is at the station now thats all i
know

  the reporters exchanged glances
then one of them asked whats this
about a millionaires pocketbook being
found in carrolls pocket

  i heard a rumor to that effect said
the inspector but im not prepared
to answer any questions

  isnt it a fact queried one of the
reporters that there have been a good
many holdups in the neighborhood
and that your man hines was up there
on that account

  there have been some wild stories
in the newspapers the inspector be-
gan but checked himself as he per-
ceived a lieutenant entering by a door
upon the left the lieutenant executed
a sort of military salute and departed
without having opened his mouth

  you boys will have to get out of
here now said the inspector ill see
you later 

  the reporters filed out like so many
pallbearers every one of them looked
at his watch though there was a clock
in plain sight on the wall it was half
past one in the morning and minutes
were precious

	no one remained in the room except


detective story magazine

the chief and a man in a dark-gray
suit who sat against the wall opposite
the door where the lieutenant had ap-
peared

  you know him carter dont you
asked the inspector

  three years ago replied the de-
tective i knew him as a brilliant and
promising fellow but he passed out
of my sight

  writer eh ive read one of his
stories it was good too why the
devil should he have done this thing

  carter answered only with a gesture
the inspector glanced quickly toward
the door then leaning forward in his
chair with his right elbow on the desk
and his open hand against the side of
his face he waited in the shadow

  the brim of carters hat was nearly
level with his eyes and as the principal
souripe of light was a cluster of laimps
against the wall and almost directly
over his head his countenance was
scarcely visible

  the door at the left swung open and
two officers appeared with the prisoner
between them they paused an instant
so that the man seemed to come alone
into the white glare of light and the
oppressive silence

  he was tall and of a strong frame
but excessively thin he had wavy
dark-brown hair a high forehead pain-
fully wrinkled above the bridge of the
nose pale-blue eyes with that faded
look one sees in the eyes of tired
women a light mustache and a well-
molded but rather weak chin with a
dimple in it he wore a shabby black
overcoat above what seemed to be ex-
pensive and fashionable evening dress

  carter who remembered prescott
carroll as he had been was shocked at
the change in him he seemed to have
lived a dozen years between twenty-nine
and thirty-two

  there was a straight-backed wooden
chair which standing alone in the mid-
dle of the big and bare room had a

singular effect of isolation carroll
looked at it perceived that it was for
him and sat down with a shudder

  at that moment hines the headquar-
ters man who had assisted in the arrest
appeared at the door the inspector
beckoned to him and he came for-
ward  while carter crossing the room
whispered to one of the policemen who
immediately went out

  well said the inspector address-
ing hines

  at ten minutes past twelve re-
sponded the officer i was going west
along seventy-eighth street toward
berkeley avenue there is an apart-
ment house on the southeast corner
with an alley behind it which runs half-
way down the block and then turns to
the avenue theres an iron fence with
a gate on each end

  close by this fence where there isnt
much light i saw this man stooping
over a body that lay on the sidewalk i
ran up and at the same time patrol-
man bruce came from the direction of
the avenue we had the man between
us and when he saw that he surren-
dered he seemed to be dazed and we
couldnt get him to say anything to us

  i recognized the man on the ground
as oliver brundage he was alive
then but unconscious hedied before
the ambulance came there was no
weapon brundage was killed by strik-
ing his head in falling we had the
body taken to the station house and
took this man there he talked to him-
self on the way he said dont
worry dont worry ill be all right
its the best thing that could have hap-
pened he admitted having killed
brundage but that is all we could get
out of him

  the inspector turned to carroll and
asked him whether he had anything to
say warning him in accordance with
the law that whatever he said could be
used against him on the trial

  he remained silent for perhaps half
the mysterious highwayman



a minute during which interval hines
laid upon the inspectors desk a pack-
age containing all that had been taken
from the prisoner when he was
searched at the station house

  denial is useless said carroll at
last i was taken in the act

  his manner was indefinably strange
if one may attempt description it was
more like an invalids than a criminals
this man of cultured mind and deli-
cately sensitive nature seemed to feel
neither remorse nor shame there was
evidence of considerable anxiety but
this state was repeatedly interrupted by
involuntary outbursts of reassurance
almost of satisfaction

  what was your motive asked the
inspector

  robbery replied the prisoner
cheerfully i was driven to it by pov-
erty

  the inspector looked hastily at car-
ter who returned the glance meaningly
both men perceived that the prisoners
answer was a lie and that it covered
a mystery this case which on a cas-
ual view seemed so clear being the
arrest of a highway robber beside the
body of his victim became at once to
these experienced men a problem for
close and rigid investigation

  i thought you were successful in
your profession said the inspector

  i might have been was the reply
but i had bad luck and many burdens
there were people dependent upon me
i never worry about myself i sup-
pose nobody does it was about
others

  he became excited as he spoke and
his self-control slipped away it was
obvious that he did not mean to tell his
story but that it told itself just as the
first words he had uttered in that room
had overridden his will

  it appeared that he had been married
five years before and that his wife had
almost immediately begun to lose her
sight as the result of a malady rare

and little understood gradually with
that steady deliberation which nature
commands and human torturers vainly
strive to imitate the shadows had
closed around her carroll had beg-
gared himself with doctors he had be-
come a borrower under the pressure of
a need that could not be postponed
his friends had turned from him and
some of them for the sake of the spite
that grows out of money had raised
up other enemies when their own
power to injure him had seemed in-
adequate

  meanwhile his strength had de-
clined and his imagination too much
occupied with images of his own in-
creasing sorrow had ceased to suggest
the pictures which his art required his
earnings had decreased as his needs
grew he had labored under that
enormous disadvantage of visible mis-
fortune he had become the lame wolf
which the pack rends

  throughout the latter part of this
wretched period his sister and his
brothers widow with two children had
been dependent upon him his wife
at last had gone to a private hospital
where the charges were excessive and
the benefits few

  the wonder was that the man had
not gone mad laboring with a brain so
clogged with miserable thoughts yet
he did not seem to be insane though
surely on the brink of it

  neither carter nor the inspector in-
terrupted carrolls recital which he
himself finally broke off with an ex-
clamation of despair

  you see i cant help telling this
he said though upon my soul i did
not mean to do it

  the inspector glanced at carter and
touched his forehead unperceived by
carroll the detective made a nega-
tive sign

  let us see what we have here said
the inspector opening the packet which
hines had brought


detective story magazine

  it contained a few trifles separately
wrapped up because they were obvi-
ously the prisoners and the things that
he was supposed to have taken from
brundage the latter consisted of a
handkerchief some letters a cigarette
case a cardcase and several keys
another  handkerchief-a womans-
and small coin to the value of sixty-
four cents were marked as having been
found in brundages pockets by the
police

  then you got no money at all  said
the inspector

  i got a pocketbook replied car-
roll with hesitation

  do you mean to say that you got
this from brundage demanded the
inspector holding up the wallet

  certainly answered carroll but he
did not meet the eye of the questioner

  do you know whose pocketbook it
s

  they told me at the station house
said carroll faintly that it was stan-
ton ripleys

  stanton ripley was a young man
about town possessed of great wealth
and a barnful of wild oats the
pocketbook bore his initials and the
crest of his family in gold and enamel
it was a plain light russia leather
book of the sort that folds in the mid-
dle with one large compartment on each
side carter received it from the
chiefs hand and discovered that it
contained three thousand and ten dol-
lars-one one-thousand-dollar bill four
of five hundred dollars and two of five
dollars all new

  they found this in the prisoners
coat-tail pocket said the chief were
you aware he continued addressing
carroll that this was in brundages
possession when you attacked him

  carroll pondered upon this question

  i couldnt know that he said at
last in a faint voice

  carter observed that he had taken
hold of the sides of his chair as if to

keep from falling out of it and that a
bluish pallor had overspread his face

  is there anything i can do for you 
asked the detective kindly

  could i have something to eat
said the prisoner in an embarrassed
tone of course if its too much trou-
ble-

  i have already sent out for some
supper for you replied carter look-
ing closely at him it occurred to me
that you might like it i wonder it
hasnt come before this

  carroll expressed his gratitude and
while he was doing so a policeman en-
tered with several packages the de-
tective drew up a small table and set
forth a bottle of milk and a loaf of
bread at sight of which the prisoners
eyes shone behind him the policeman
was opening a box from which he took
a steak and potatoes on a wooden plate
and a knife and fork he held up
the knife and looked inquiringly at
carter who nodded and the utensils
were laid upon the table

  the prisoner ate well many times
he spoke aloud in praise of the food
clearly not meaning to do so for he al-
ways checked himself with shame

  now he said at last i feel first-
rate heavens

  the exclamation came suddenly
carroll half rose and then sank back
he passed his hand across his forehead
which had become wet in an instant

  my wife and my sisters he cried
how shall i tell them

  i am afraid that the newspapers
will anticipate you unless you tele-
graph said carter

  he took a pad of blanks and a pen-
cil from the inspectors desk and laid
them before carroll who after many
attempts wrote this message

  be prepared for very bad news yet all
for the best dont try to understand
dont come here will send money

  he puzzled a long time over the last
sentence but finally let it stand the
the mysterious highwayman



message was addressed to his sister
miss hilda carroll in a small town in
massachusetts at the bottom he wrote
a request to repeat the-telegram to his
wife in care of the physician in charge
of the hospital where she then was

  carter gave the telegram with money
for its transmission to one of the po-
licemen who went out with it immedi-
ately the inspector meanwhile was
answering a call upon the telephone
that stood on his desk he received
a long report at the close of which he
ordered that the prisoner should be
taken into an adjoining room

  nick he said as soon as they were
alone ive just got word from the
man who was sent to ripleys rooms
when the pocketbook was found upon
carroll ripley has just come home
with a bad wound in the head he
seems to have been wandering around
the streets dazed for quite a long time
he was at his club until about eleven
oclock when he started out for a walk
on fifth avenue alongside the park
about sixty-third street he saw a man
step out from behind a tree as he
turned to face the fellow he got a rap
on the left side of the head and the
next thing he remembers he was on
the other side of the park way up by
eighty-first street and it was more
than two hours later

  where he had been in the mean-
time he doesnt know his pocketbook
was gone and his watch nothing else
was taken he says he probably could
not identify his assailant though the
man looked familiar he knew carroll
very well they were in college together
he lent him some money a year or
more ago then they had a falling-out
and he hasnt seen carroll since he
doesnt think it was carroll who as-
saulted him what do you make out
of this 

  well it seems somewhat extraordi-
nary said the detective that a man
on the verge of starvation should not

  a ds

have used one of those five-dollar bills
to buy a meal it occurs to me that we
havent found ripleys watch and i
am also puzzled to know why a man
who had made a haul of three thousand
dollars should take the desperate
chance of assaulting brundage who is
well known never to have any money

  perhaps carroll didnt know him
suggested the inspector

  its as bad one way as another
replied the detective he wouldnt
have risked three thousand dollars and
his liberty on the chance of what might
be in a strangers pockets however
we might ask him about it

  carroll was brought back into the
room and was informed of what had
been learned about ripley he made
a strong effort to cover his emotions
but carter was of the opinion that for
some mysterious reason the prisoner
was not only surprised but pleased

  it is true he said i did not take
the pocketbook from brundage i took
it from ripley

  where demanded the inspector
who had not mentioned the place desig-
nated by ripley

  in central park was the reply i
followed him from his club

  at this point the prisoner showed his
first disinclination to answer questions
yet he consented to hear  few from
carter and this exchange resulted
were you acquainted with brun-
dage 

  i knew him by sight and by reputa-
tion

  when did you first see him this eve-
ning 

  when he turned out of the avenue
into seventy-eighth street

  did you recognize him

  yes

  did you speak to him before attack-
ing him

  no

  where did you get that dress suit
  ripley gave it to me a year and a


detective story magazine

half ago when he got me to go to a
dinner at a club

  do you mean that he bought it for
you 

  no it was his he had just had it
made it was one of his freaks to give
it to me

  what is that stain

  it was a reddish mark as if from a
blow with a rusty iron bar and it ex-
tended across the back of the overcoat
about the waistline the garment was
lying on a chair carroll looked at the
stain with mild surprise and said he
did not know what it was

  your dress coat was tom in the
struggle with brundage i suppose
said the detective indicating a ripped
seam at the back of the left shoulder
and some further damage here and
there

  carroll nodded

  you had your overcoat on when
you were arrested didnt you 

  yes i just slipped it on after the
-the struggle

  why didnt you run through the
alley when you saw the policemen com-
ing r

  i didnt know there was any gate in
the fence replied the prisoner

  this closed the examination and
carroll was consigned to a cell

  it is a singular coincidence said
the detective that i happen to be very
familiar with the spot where this arrest
was made i waited there some hours
on a recent evening the gate in the
fence could not be overlooked by any
one and just within it there is a rusty
iron bar extending from the gatepost
to the side of the house from the
appearance of the mark on carrolls
coat i should say that he had leaned
against that bar i came very near do-
ing it myself so carroll had a neat
way of escape and did not take it
the inspector drummed with his fin-
gers upon his desk and gently whistled
a little tune

  for a case that opens with a con-
fession said he at last this is a
beautiful muddle to begin with the

man is such a purposeless liar-

  i would hardly say that rejoined
carter he knows what he is about
a liar he certainly is-one of the most
perverse and incalculable that i ever
encountered-but his statements help to
clear the view obviously he is will-
ing to say anything which will tend to
show that he attacked brundage for the
purpose of robbing him

  now of course this crime was not
robbery though carroll tried to give
that color to it and on a hasty inspira-
tion too or he would not have com-
mitted the absurdity of taking the mans
handkerchief to say nothing about this
rubbish of cigarette and cardcases
you mean that he killed brundage
for some other reason asked the in-
spector

  did you observe the weather re-
joined carter with a smile it has
been snowing a little and the pave-
ments are a mess carrolls coat shows
a considerable struggle and by all the
evidence the two men must have fallen
to the ground one gripping the others
throat it was then that brundages
head struck the projection of the iron
fence but the assailant could not imme-
diately have known the result with-
out doubt they rolled there together in
the dirt yet there isnt a mark on
carrolls knees

  thats so but the elbow and left
sleeve of his coat are soiled not the
overcoat hed taken that off

  it is all very singular said the de-
tective i am being gradually led to-
ward a remarkable conclusion but i
am not ready to talk about it yet i
suggest that we put the whole thing off
till to-morrow

  the case is in your hands said
the inspector if you will be kind
enough to take charge of it

  on the following day the detective

called upon stanton ripley at his
rooms which have sometimes been
mentioned in print as the most luxuri-
ous bachelor apartments in new york
ripley was under a doctors care but
had almost ceased to require it he
had a contusion on the left side of his
head behind the ear but was suffering
principally from mental strain the re-
sult of his adventure of the previous
night

  it was necessary to avoid exciting
him and the detective proceeded with
the utmost caution ripley declared
positively that his assailant was not
carroll and after an hour of shrewd
questioning he admitted his belief that
it was brundage then he seemed to
regret having made the statement and
he concluded by asserting his ignorance
of the highwaymans identity

  it became necessary therefore to
trace brundages movements on the
previous evening and this proved to be
easy from nine oclock until a few
minutes before his death brundage had
been in the apartments of a young
widow a mrs haskell who lived with
her mother and sister in that building
on berkeley avenue behind which ran
the alley that has been referred to
there had been three other guests a
man and two women and brundage
had put them into a cab just before
going to meet his fate it had undoubt-
edly been his intention to walk across
to his home which was on central
park west

  this negatived any idea that carroll
could have found ripleys pocketbook
in brundages pocket but where had
he obtained it since ripley was sure
that he was not the robber  and what
motive could have induced carroll to
play his singular part in this affair

  a study of the locality could not fail
to raise the presumption that carroll
had been lying in wait for brundage
the spot was well chosen yet carroll
was unknown to the haskells and

could hardly have had any means of
knowing where brundage would spend
the evening indeed all the evidence
that carter could collect seemed to
show that carroll and brundage had
no common interest and no possible
ground for animosity

  there were rumors of ill feeling be-
tween ripley and brundage on account
of the fascinating mrs haskell at
whose home both were frequent visi-
tors but even upon the wild supposi-
tion that ripley had been sufficiently
jealous to employ carroll as his bravo
he would hardly have paid him with his
watch and pocketbook nor would
carroll have collected his price with the
aid of a sand club

  the newspapers saw in carroll a
mysterious highwayman they exag-
gerated one or two small robberies in
the neighborhood into a great list of
desperate crimes and the young author
was pictured as one of the famous de-
generates of the age but the real puz-
zles of the case remained unanswered
nobody could account for carrolls re-
tention of that pocketbook for his
senseless risk in attacking brundage
while carrying so great a plunder from
another crime for his failure to take
an easy chance of escape

  in the evening carter called at head-
quarters and found carrolls sister his
sister-in-law and the latters two chil-
dren the women had come to the
city with a vague idea that their pres-
ence was required and without enough
money to take them back again they
and the children were in tears and the
scene was intensely distressing it be-
came positively harrowing when the
inspector yielded to their entreaties
and summoned the prisoner from his
cell

  somewhat to carters surprise the
man was greatly improved in appear-
ance his bearing was marked by a
sad serenity he beheld the tears and
accepted the reproaches of the women

with perfect composure and it was
only when they spoke of their imme-
diate need of money that he showed any
considerable anxiety he referred
them to a lawyer whom he had retained
during the day saying that he would
probably assist them otherwise he
said nothing to them except vaguely
reassuring words and though they said
that they would come again on the fol-
lowing day-a suggestion which the in-
spector did not see fit to contradict-
carroll bade them farewell with an air
of finality

  when the prisoner had been re-
moved carter inquired about his law-
yer and learned that a corporation
attorney practically unknown in crim-
inal courts had been retained car-
roll had given the name and address
and the attorney had been summoned

  to the best of my judgment said
the inspector he had never seen the
prisoner before carroll was ar-
raigned and waived examination-as
you know of course

  during the evening carter obtained
a bit of evidence not altogether unim-
portant it appeared that when ripley
left his club on the night of the crime
a man answering carrolls description
who had been loitering for more than
an hour in the neighborhood had fol-
lowed him two cabmen were the wit-
nesses on this point and they were per-
fectly confident but they said that
ripley had gone up fifty-ninth street
instead of fifth avenue carter called
upon ripley in regard to this contradic-
tion and was informed that the young
man had walked a little way up fifty-
ninth street but had returned he had
not seen carroll following him

  about noon the next day carter
called upon the inspector who began
conversation by stating that he had
been devoting a good deal of thought to
the brundage case

  and you have evolved a theory

said the detective with a smile shall
i tell you what it is

  the inspector shut one eye and scru-
tinized carter closely out of the other

  go ahead confound you he said
youll tell me what it is and then
youll show me why it isnt good for
anything

  on the contrary replied the detec-
tive it is very near the truth in fact
there can hardly be two theories of this
affair i happen to know that one of
your men compared the stain on car-
rolls overcoat with the iron bar i spoke
of-as to height from the ground gen-
eral appearance et cetera the conclu-
sion that carroll knew about the gate
and the way of escape through the alley
is thus verified why didnt he run
the obvious explanation is that he re-
mained to cover the retreat of some
one else

  precisely said the inspector if
the snow hadnt melted so soon we
would have found tracks

  you believe continued carter
that this young man in his half-crazy
desperation had formed an alliance
with some thug that it was the thug
who attacked ripley that the ease with
which ripley was disposed of sent
them both upon a mad career of depre-
dation with the intent of doing one
big nights work and then quitting the
town

  well something of that sort ad-
mitted the inspector

  then it is the pal who has engaged
this lawyer and has supplied carrolls

relatives with money--

  have they got some 

  plenty replied the detective and
they have gone back to massachusetts
and i can tell you something more
agreeable two of the leading medical
experts of this city have taken an in-
terest in mrs carroll-who by the
way is a very charming woman whose
needs but never her importunities have
the mysterious highwayman



burdened our friend for she is different
from the others

  you have seen her

  yes this forenoon she does not
yet know of her husbands misfortune
it was deemed unwise to tell her but
-would you believe it-those experts
who were so much interested by the
accounts of her case published yester-
day in connection with this affair tell
me that she has a good chance of re-
covery that the treatment hitherto has
been all wrong and that she may fully
regain her sight

  well im glad of that said the
inspector

  the experts are great men said
carter but they are not philanthro-
pists  they are sure of their money by
the way have you seen carroll to-
day 

  yes and the change in him is won-
derful upon my word he has gained
pounds of flesh and he looks positively
handsome

  his mind is relieved responded
carter you remember that he never
worries about himself that is the
truest word he spoke to us worry for
others has driven him half crazy-
money worry-and now that it is over
he sees the electric chair before him
and is cheerful

  i was near forgetting he con-
tinued after a brief pause that i have
recovered ripleys watch some of my
men searched the west side of the park
from seventy-seventh street north-
ward this morning and they found it
where some one had thrown it ovet the
wall a portrait on the inside of the
case at the back has been scratched
with a knife but the job was done in
the dark and the face is still recogniz-
able it was mrs haskells

 why in blazes-

  my friend it is as clear as a bell
match it with my discovery that car-
rolls coat showed every mark of the
fight with brundage in which singu-

larly enough his nether garments seem
not to have shared

  do you mean that he changed coats
with the real assailant gasped the in-
spector

  beyond a doubt

  the inspector sprang up and seized
his hat from the rack on the wall

  lets go down to the tombs he
said carroll is there

  in a private room of the famous
prison-the prisoner in the brundage
murder case ied from his cell he knew
not why found the inspector and the
detective waiting for him

  mr carroll said carter kindly
the cat is out of the bag

  the prisoneftarted violently and
his face flushed

  you were in desperate straits the
detective continued you knew not
where to turn for help you had quar-
reled with ripley who once had be-
friended you and yet in your emer-
gency you could think of no one else
you dressed as well as you could in
the suit that he had given you and yet
when you came to the club your shabby
overcoat kept you from asking for the
man you wished to see when he came
out you followed him hesitating to
speak for miles along the streets in
the winter night you kept him in sight
while he with a foolish burden of jeal-
ousy on his mind did not see you

  at the corner of berkeley avenue
and seventy-eighth street he stopped
presently he turned back and you
stepped within the iron gate to let him
pass then brundage appeared be-
fore you realized what was happening
the sharp struggle was over ripley
had gratified his jealousy far more fully
than he had planned to do brundage
lay dead on the sidewalk and ripley
bending over him groaned in agony

  a sudden grotesque and terrible
thought leaped into your mind-to ex-
change burdens with ripley to take
his deadly sin and give him your care


detective story magazine

that would rest so lightly upon this
croesus with what insane relief he
accepted your offer what promises he
made in those few thrilling moments
we can readily imagine

  he had taken off his overcoat that
he might be the more free to punish
his rival his clothes showed the
struggle as your two suits were iden-
tical the change of coats was a natural
suggestion the purse with the money
was forgotten but ripley after he had
escaped through ihe alley remembered
it and his story of robbery was the
only invention that could meet the situ-
ation the rest comes naturally in-
cluding your queer lawyer whom rip-
ley recommended

  curse you cried carroll leaping
to his feet you have ruined me

  in return let me promise my help
said carter i pity you driven mad
by care as you have been there is no
reason in the world why you cannot
bear your burdens when you have had
rest with an easy mind i can prom-
ise it to you

  carroll sank back into a chair and
began to weep hysterically

  the inspector viewed him with pro-
fessional self-control yet with some
signs of sympathy

  shall i send a man for ripley he
whispered

  i have attended to that responded
the detective he is on his way to
headquarters by this time

  manslaughteri suppose muttered
the inspector ill bet a hat that he
doesnt get over five years

  ravenswood gazed at both from a
swivel chair at his large roll-top desk
it stood in a handsomely furnished
room on the second floor of an office
building on broadway two wide
plate-glass windows overlooked a side
street both were emblazoned with
large gold-leaf letters stating the re-
cently established business of the occu-

  pants or presumably so as was true
of a highly polished brass sign on the
corridor door

reliance detective bureau
henry dale manager

  the entire interior had a correspond-
ing veneer of probity and eminent
respectability there was another roll-
top desk in the main office a large
safe occupied one corner a case of
law books stood against one of the
walls a handsome leather-top table
was laden with reference books and
publications bearing upon the business
a costly persian drugget covered most
of the floor a door to the right led
into a finely furnished private office
one to the left opened into a rear room
in which were other equipments and
several less expensive desks ostensibly
those of men employed as private de-
tectives by this bureau of secret crim-

what blind could be more ef-
fective ravenswood had forcibly
argued when advocating the audacious
project what field could be more
broad and rich with possibilities
where could safer headquarters be
found what police official not ex-
cluding joe glidden himself would
even dream of such a subterfuge or of

seeking in such an environment and
seeming vocation a flock of thieving
red ravens

  ravenswood was right the very
audacity of it rendered it reliable nor
would lynx-eyed joe glidden even
have recognized in henry dale the
directing genius of the artful enter-
prise with his gray-streaked hair his
flowing mustache and drooping im-
perial the versatile and resourceful
knave by whom he had been repeatedly
outwitted and was so anxious to appre-
hend

  pay paddy indeed the game is
well worth the candle ravenswood
replied with assurance drawing up in
his chair i have looked over the en-
tire ground i have covered every foot
of it osgood has been the bank mes-
senger for seven years hes as honest
as the day is long but custom dulls
the sense of responsibility and the edge
of caution paddy and of that we can
take advantage

  but suppose dickie-

  suppose nothing ravenswood in-
terrupted i am not building on sup-
positions paddy but upon reasonable
certainties osgoods habits are very
regular his round of collections does
not vary materially after a big day in
the stock market he covers nearly the
same ground when he arrives at the
waite building where he invariably
calls on sage   slocum the bond
brokers the leather bag he carries
chained to his wrist alwayi contains
from fifty to eighty thousand in cash
bonds and negotiable securities that
surely warrants taking chances

 long chances dickie nolan
readily admitted theres no denying
that

  well take them then paddy

  but what about his trailer butler
who is always close behind him with
his hands on a ready gun in each side
pocket we must figure on getting
him dickie as well as osgood

  sure thing drogan appeared a bit
doubtful get him dickie is right
and get him first or his canisters will
start barking right off the reel

 how can that be done nolan
questioned its not easy to down two
such chesty blokes one with a brace
of  gats and get away with the coin in
broad daylight outside of that
dickie it looks easy

  i have it perfectly planned re-
plied ravenswood confidently

  say how then out with it

  to begin with paddy there now is
a vacant office adjoining those occu-
pied by sage  slocum it is directly
back of the two private rooms of the
firm and the door must be passed by
any one going there from the elevator
or stairway

  faith thats clear in my coco
nolan nodded what more

  that vacant office must be rented
we must establish two of our red birds
there as if in legitimate business that
done-stop a bit ravenswood broke
off abruptly with a glance toward the
rear door call fallon murdock
badger and billy green all hands
will be needed in this job i will state
my plans to all therefore and show
you how we can pick this plum with-
out even scratching a finger slip the

  two men both of rugged and reso-
lute aspect were walking briskly up
broad street one morning a week later
one about fifteen feet behind the other
they were approaching the heart of the
financial district

  edgar osgood in advance was the
trusty messenger of the fidelity na-
tional bank he carried a strong
leather satchel closed with a strap and
fastened to his left arm with a steel
chain concealed by his sleeve and cuff
the other trailing him constantly was
one of the bank detectives david but-
the return of red raven



ler the messengers bodyguard or con-
voy so to speak with vigilant eyes and
his hands gripping as paddy nolan had
said a ready gun in each side pocket

  none of the throng of men in busy
broad street appeared to have any in-
terest in them as osgood was ap-
proaching a corner nevertheless which
he turned almost daily to go to the
waite building a red raven in an
opposite doorway signaled to murdock
and badger then waiting in the side
street

  guided by these signals both men
arrived at the corner just in time to
pass osgood when he turned it and
strode on toward broadway upon
rounding the corner however which
butler was at that moment approach-
ing they pretended to resume a bitter
altercation coming quickly to ugly
oaths and vicious blows when directly
in front of the lank detective

butler stopped short suspecting
nothing but naturally impelled to in-
he thrust badger aside cry-
sharply as he separated the two
men

  cut that this is no place for a
fight

  cut what badger retorted con-
fronting him what are you butting
in about

  youll learn what for you ruffian
unless-

  the threat on butlers lips was never
completed he turned upon badger
while speaking when as quick as a
flash murdock seized the opportunity
and dropped him with a blow from one
side a blow that would have felled an
ox then while the few startled ob-
servers near by stood aghast for the
brutal deed was done in a dozen sec-
onds murdock and badger ran across
broad street aiid entered a motor car
driven by fallon and in a moment they
were speeding north safe from imme-
diate pursuit

  butler was lying on the sidewalk

senseless blood flowing from his nose
and ears a crowd quickly gathered
two policemen appeared upon the
scene a physician forced his way
through the throng none knew the
stricken man the physician exam-
ined him hastily then ordered his re-
moval to the nearest hospital the
ambulance came and departed the
crowd dispersed and the street re-
sumed its customary appearance-and
the first move in the knavish game was
successfully made

 ravenswood was right custom
dulls the edge of caution for in the
meantime without a backward glance
in search of the man supposed to be
following him and without having
heard the brief disturbance around the
corner osgood proceeded quickly to
the waite building where he ran up
the stairs to the second floor and ap-
proached a suite of offices in the end
corridor

  as he came nearer he noticed a
masons tools and a pail of cement on
the floor at the same moment too
a man in a long linen coat with a pen
over his ear appeared at the open door
of-the recently rented office

  ah it is you mr osgood ra-
venswood could be very suave and im-
pressive on such an occasion this
way in sir if you please

 that way osgood paused in-
voluntarily

  sage  slocum are enlarging their
quarters so as to include this office
their doors are temporarily blocked by
the workmens stagings you can en-
ter this way however and-

  yes yes certainly

 osgood suspected nothing he
walked blindly into the- trap he fol-
lowed ravenswood into the office just
as a supposed clerk paddy nolan was
rising from his seat at a desk at the
same moment too he heard the door
behind him closed noisily and the sharp


detective story magazine

click of the lock-but he saw and heard
no more

  drogan darting from behind the
door felled him with a single blow of
a sandbag

 ravenswood caught him when he
fell placing him quietly on the floor
and saying as calmly as if no desperate
deed had been done

  bring in those tools paddy and the
pail of cement our web has caught
the fly the rest should be easy

  like breaking straws dickie no-
lan laughed audibly pipe the leather
bag stuffed like a holiday bird it
has the golden goose skun a mile
faith dickie its like money sept from
home

  detective glidden spread both of his
muscular hands on his broad knees and
gazed grimly at the venerable cashier
of the fidelity national bank in
whose private office he was seated about
an hour after the two crimes were com-
mitted he very soon had become as
ravenswood had anticipated an active
and aggressive figure in the case the
result of an urgent appeal to police
headquarters and he now wore a look
that challenged opposition

  an absconder thats what your
man osgood is mr harvey in spite
of your faith in the fellow he was
forcibly insisting the circumstances
admit of no other conclusion theres
nothing else to it i know whats what
all right in a case of this kind

  but it seems incredible mr glid-
den utterly incredible mr harvey
shook his head doubtfully osgood
has been in our employ for a dozen
years i have known him ever since

he first-

  since the lord made little apples
perhaps but that has no weight with
me i can size up a job of this kind
mr harvey with half an eye

  but our bank detective butler also
is-

  oh ive talked with butler glid-
den cut in gruffly hes down and out
with a broken head luckily however
his mind was clear and he told me just
what came off in broad street there
was nothing to it

  do you meant that the fight-

  that was a frame-up nothing else
glidden again interrupted it was
pulled off only to detain butler and give
one of the ruffians a chance to down
him then both of them bolted and
got away in a waiting motor car as i
have learned from several observers
all this speaks for itself the whole
infernal job had been carefully
planned

  planned by osgood mr harvey
anxiously questioned is that what
you think

  think be hanged i know it was
glidden was nothing if not positive
osgood took that way to elude butler
that had to be done before he could
bolt he hired those two ruffians o
turn the trick while he pretended to
be hurrying on to the waite building
that butler states is where he was
heading but did he go there not
by a long chalk i have telephoned to
sage  slocum the bare fact that
osgood did not call on them clinches
the case against him

  unless he was waylaid and the vic-
tim of foul play harvey suggested

  nonsense glidden growled it
was only half a block to the waite
building the street was alive with
people he could not have been way-
laid thats out of the question

  well you may be right still-

  i know im right take it from
me mr harvey osgood was the only
man back of any foul play he has
absconded theres nothing else to it
-save to run him down and recover
his plunder

  you may be right mr glidden but
the return of red raven



it seems utterly incredible mr har-
vey repeated wringing his hands i
could not have believed it i had abso-
lute faith in osgood

  too much faith far too much
glidden arose abruptly osgood has
taken advantage of it as hundreds have
done under like conditions but dont
you be down in the mouth hell be
some slick mark me if he can slip
through my fingers i have set the
wheels in motion hell be nabbed in
some quarter within twenty-four hours
how much did he get away with 

  about sixty thousand dollars as
near as i now can tell chiefly in bonds
and negotiable securities

  well recover them take it from
me glidden jammed on his hat
well get him ill be off with arm-
strong now and try to pick up his trail
he may have been seen near the waite
building i want a word with sage
 slocum too as he is known to have
been heading for their office youll
hear from me later now jack well
be off

  glidden did not wait for an answer
followed by armstrong who had been
assisting him in the investigations al-
ready hurriedly made he strode out of
the bank and entered a waiting taxi-
cab gruffly giving the chauffeur his
directions he had not a shadow of
doubt uncertainty was foreign to
gliddens nature he felt sure he was
right sure he had sized up the case
correctly and sure that he soon would
be hot on the trail of the supposed ab-
sconder all this seemed to be entirely
warranted moreover when he entered
the waite building and talked with the
superintendent whom he chanced to
meet on the stairway

  one moment said he stopping
him youre the man  judge who
looks after this building

  i am sir martin ready by name
sir he replied

  do you know a bank messenger who

frequently comes here named os-
good 

  faith sir i do ready nodded
ive known him for years by sight
seen him lately

  he was here to-day sir along about
noon

  he was eh gliddens grim eyes
lighted where did you see him
turning in the end corridor sir on
the second floor he was going to sage

	slocums office sir i think he often
goes there

  do you know that he went there
no sir i only saw him heading
that way

  how did he look did he appear
excited or in haste

  well he seemed in a bit of a hurry
sir but not more than common he
always walks brisklike

  did he have the leather satchel he
usually carries

  he did sir i can swear to that
you did not sjee him leave the build-
ing

  i did not ready shook his head
he left by the other door mebbe
which leads into the court at the end
of the building he often goes that
way

  i see gliddens brows knit closer
thats all ready he went through
this building armstrong only to avoid
observation and don a disguise i see
his game its a safe bet that his own
mother would not have known him
when he went out through the end
corridor

  not from a side of leather arm-
strong agreed while they moved on up
the stairs he aimed to break off his
trail right here joe hoping to mystify
the police or lead them to think he war
killed and robbed somewhere in the
building

 mystify be hanged glidden
growled derisively he cant blind
me im not to be fooled in a case of
this kind ill trace the thieving rat


detective story magazine

armstrong in spite of all he can do
this way to sage  slocums office
well stop there for a moment only
then head out through the end court
theres the stairway yonder well
find some one believe me who saw him
leaving and can tip us to his disguise
glidden found both bond brokers in
their main office but they could only
repeat what they already had told him
by telephone that they had been ex-
pecting osgood with a quantity of
bonds but that he had not delivered
them nor been seen that day by any of
their clerks

  he was seen in the adjoining cor-
ridor nevertheless within five minutes
after butler was assaulted glidden
confidently informed them i know
one man who saw him and there may
be others if so i want to find them
try the new tenants in the next of-
fice mr sage advised they may
have seen him

  new tenants glidden snapped
like a hungry trout at the possibility
suggested how long have they been
there

  less than a week

  do you know them or anything
about them

  only that two men are occupying
the office

  whats their business

  i cannot say not having inquired
sage smiled expressively as he spoke
they have not appeared to be doing
much

 havent eh glidden swung
around with a growl ill mighty soon
find out go with me jack-but not
you two gentlemen he quickly added
when both brokers were about to fol-
low him well look after this busi-
ness you attend to your own

  by jove joe there may be some-
thing in it said armstrong as both
returned to the corridor new ten-
ants right here and at just this time
may be more than a coincidence

  thats the very point replied glid-
den striding to the office door it
warrants suspicion at least

  he tried the door and found it
locked gazing through the keyhole he
could see a cheap chair and an ordinary
flat desk much defaced and entirely
destitute of writing materials a fact
which instantly increased his suspicions
starting up he jerked out a ring of
keys saying with bulldog determina-
tion 

  well go in there it looks leery
to me armstrong and not on the level
ill bet my roll against a bean pod-
ah this key will open it

  glidden opened the door while speak-
ing and stepped into the deserted office
the pail of cement was on the floor
in one corner near by was a trowel
and a few small tools a plaid woolen
suit somewhat worn hung over the
back of a chair upon seeing it glid-
den vented a wolfish snarl and cried
exultantly

  i was right by thunder as right as
a rivet thats the very suit osgood
is said to have worn harvey men-
tioned it when describing the rascal
wrere hot on his trail jack all right
as sure as theres skin on a lemon
but its no lemon for me armstrong
not this time you can bet on that
but what do you make of all this 
armstrong questioned perplexedly gaz-
ing around why was this office
rented  who are the tenants  whats
this stuff in the pail it looks like
cement

  glidden did not reply immediately
he caught up the plaid suit and hur-
riedly searched the pockets finding
them empty he then drew oyit the
desk drawers glancing into each and
violently closing it all were as empty
as a drum next he strode to the win-
dow and looked down on the narrow
court then out to the near street

  hang it armstrong its as plain as
twice two he cried turning back it
the return of red raven



clinches my theory no business has
been done here bar knavery theres
not a pen pencil or scrap of paper in
the desk it was picked up second-
hand and brought here along with the
rest of these traps only for a blind
osgood was one of the tenants per-
haps coming here at times in disguise
or possibly the two ruffians he had hired
to down butler this morning thats
dead open and shut

  you think that this office was

rented then-

  only to provide osgood with an
immediate temporary refuge glidden
plunged on interrupting one in
which he could change his clothes and
so disguise himself as to preclude rec-
ognition and prevent being traced
theres nothing else to it-nothing
armstrong absolutely nothing

  by gracious joe i think youre
right armstrong always had faith
in gliddens theories there cer-
tainly seems to be nothing else to it
seems be hanged its a copper-
riveted cinch glidden declared glanc-
ing at the tools and cement on the floor
those things cut no ice they were
brought here only to suggest a legiti-
mate business the birds have flown
armstrong and we must get after
them we waste time in searching an
empty nest come on go with me
while the going is good theres a
fellow outside i think who can hand
us something

  glidden had caught sight of him
from the window he was in nearly
the same place and position too when
glidden hurried down the end stair-
way and emerged into the narrow
court now feeling doubly sure that he
was hot on the trail of the absconder

  his immediate quest however was
a miserably clad man who was lean-
ing against one corner of the entrance
to the court selling an occasional lead
pencil to passing pedestrians he was
a pitiable-looking fellow his hair and

beard were unkempt his garments
were soiled and in rags his eyes were
protected with blue spectacles denot-
ing that they had in some way been
injured

  glidden approached him and took a
pencil giving him half a dollar

 thats near enough he said
gruffly have a good time with it
i reckon theres not too much coming
your way how long have you been
standing here my man 

  the blue glasses turned squarely
upon the detective seemed to light up
with a look of surprise the man
chuckled audibly eagerly pocketing the
coin while he replied huskily

  thankee sir ive been right here
all day im here every day its
where i pick up-a living

  seen any men come out this way
from the waite building questioned
glidden tersely

 only two sir not many come
this way i wouldnt have known of
them sir bar hearing them talking in
the court where they waited a minute
for a taxi they didnt see me i
was just around the corner

  what were they saying

  one was telling about a swell lodg-
ing house where hed got a room for
the other and where he could hang out
safely the landlady not being wise to
something i dont know what he
meant they talked so low i only
heard a little

  i see gliddens eyes were glow-
ing exultantly do you know either
man

  i dont sir and that was all i
heard	

  was one of them carrying a leather
bag

  he was sir the one with whis-
kers 

  whiskers eh  glidden laughed
grimly with a significant glance at
armstrong that does settle it did
he leave in the taxi
 c

detective story magazine

  he did sir and the other walked
up the street thats all i can tell you
-bar one thing

  whats that my man out with
it

  i know the taxi driver by sight
  fine come across

  hes a tall man with broad shoul-
ders and a big black mustache you
might find him jiear the imperial ive
often seen him waiting there to pick
up a passenger

  glidden lingered to hear no more
he felt in fact that he had learned
all that the pencil vender could tell
him he had swallowed it as easily
as a concord grape he drew arm-
strong away crying exultantly while
he hurried him up the street

  hand us something was right it
was a cinch that he must have seen
osgood if he fled through the court
as i suspected well get him arm-
strong all right therell be nothing
to it now if we can round up the taxi
driver

  that should be no great task

  no task at all glidden was aglow
with confidence it will be some
feather in our bonnets all the same
if we snap bracelets on osgood before
sunset were hot on his trail all
right hot on his trail and going some
jack going some wehl soon get
him

  it was seven oclock nevertheless
when gjidden after impatiently watch-
ing in the locality mentioned saw in
forty-second street a taxicab driven
by a powerful man of the description
given him by the pencil vender hail-
ing him to the sidewalk glidden dis-
played his badge and asked gruffly
did you have a passenger about
one oclock to-day a man with a beard
and carrying a leather bag

  i sure did sir the driver quickly
admitted leaning out i got him on
a telephone call

  where

  down near the waite building he
was talking with another man near
the end court

  do you know either of them
nothing doing i never saw them
where did you take the man with
a bag

  to a house in columbus avenue
im not sure but i think its quite a
bang-up lodging house i heard the
man ask for the landlady

  do you remember the house can
you take us to it questioned glidden
as armstrong approached

  sure sir i can said the cabman
dead easy

  do so then but-stop on the oppo-
site side and a few doors away get
me

  bet you im no bonehead
tumble in jack glidden pushed
armstrong into the cab weve got
our man weve got him armstrong
as sure as death and taxes by
heaven this was good work jack
though i say it who shouldnt weve
got him all right

  it was half past seven when the
taxicab stopped nearly opposite a
block of handsome brownstone dwell-
ings the detectives sprang out and
the cabman turned and said

  its the second house in the block
the name on the door is-barnard
glidden gazed over at the house not-
ing that the vestibule and hall were
brightly lighted though all of the front
rooms were in darkness

  wait here cabby he said gruffly
we have a crook to take to head-
quarters bring two policemen jack
and station them at the front and back
door well make dead sure of him
youd better enter with me

  five minutes passed

  a burly policeman then was guard-
ing each door

  glidden mounted the front steps and
ring the bell
the return of red raven



iii

  its worth it paddy worth every
copper of it ravenswood gazed at
nolan from a luxurious armchair in
the handsomely furnished library
think what this infernal dick has
done to me and my brood of precious
red birds hes due for a jolt i told
you id hand him one mark me
paddy i will make joe glidden the
laughingstock of headquarters

  faith dickie that sure is worth
something nolan thoughtfully al-
lowed but three hundred dollars for

the use of this crib-

  its worth it paddy ravenswood
insisted i have a leaning you know
toward luxury and refinement i
wanted attractive quarters in which to
turn the trick that will add to glid-
dens chagrin and cut him the deeper
wait until the force learns paddy that
the absconder he was running down
was handed to him by the very crooks
who did the job take it from me
hell never hear the last of it

  hell beef some dickie all right
nolan grinned broadly but you took
a long chance in bringing osgoodhere
we could have left him where we
downed him and got safely away with
our plunder he might have squealed
on the way

  a man doesnt squeal paddy who
knows he will be instantly silenced with
a blade of steel he had no alternative
but death what matters now since
the safe in our detective bureau our
unsuspected headquarters contains the
plunder

 but suppose-

  what need  ravenswood cut in
again there is no contingency on
which i have not figured i had the
job itself perfectly planned i have
not provided less carefully for the
sequence

  sure dickie theres no denying
that nolan admitted admiringly

  it was a foregone conclusion
ravenswood went on that glidden
would be called into the case that he
would immediately suspect osgood
that he would visit sage  slocum
that he would learn of the new tenants
in the next office that he at once would
suspect them and-but bah why re-
view it i provided him with a soft
trail paddy so soft that i knew he
would follow it

  he sure has dickie if-

  there are none paddy his every
move has been reported by telephone
our red ravens have not been idle
it is nearly half an hour since he en-
tered the taxicab he already may be
-but have a look slip into the front
room paddy and have another look
nolan darted back of a portiere and
disappeared

  ravenswood arose and laid aside the
cigar he was smoking he bore no
likeness to henry dale of the auda-
cious detective bureau which he was
planning to turn to vast advantage
nor did he resemble any personage pre-
viously assumed his fine figure was
nearly enveloped in a handsome smok-
ing gown from the side pocket of
which while he paused near the table
he drew a revolver which he briefly
examined he was doing so when
nolan hurriedly reappeared saying a
bit excitedly

  theyre here dickie the taxi is
waiting across the avenue glidden

has just crossed over he-

  ravenswood silenced him with a
gesture pointing again to the front
room 

  wait there in the darkness he di-
rected calmly have things ready for
me

  trust me for that

  it will take me only a few minutes
to hand him whats coming to him if

he ventures to-

  ravenswood broke off abruptly the
doorbell was ringing noisily he


detectivestory magazine

waved nolan away drew his smoking
gown around him replacing the re-
volver in the pocket and then he walked
out deliberately through the brightly
lighted hall there was a subtle gleam
deep down in his fine eyes however
when he opened the door and saw glid-
den and armstrong in the vestibule
and a burly policeman at the base of
the steps

  good evening gentlemen he said

suavely why-

  wheres the landlady glidden
bluntly interrupted stepping into the
hall

  wait ravenswood opposed him
haughtily you have not been in-
vited to enter mrs barnard is absent
i am her husband however and will
attend to any matter concerning her
there was a look in the eyes of the
red raven that briefly quelled glid-
den even for he drew back a little
and said more courteously

  her husband eh you will do as
well then we are from headquarters
my namejs glidden

  glidden detective glidden
  the same

  i have heard of you said ra-
venswood with subtle dryness brows
drooping but why do you come here
in this way  this is a reputable house

 can see no occasion for-

  oh weve got nothing on your
house mr barnard or on your
estimable wife glidden again cut in
quite gruffly youre all right no
doubt but you have been imposed on
imposed on how so

  you have a lodger here who is a
crook an absconder we want him
and will do you anj your house a serv-
ice in taking him

  a crook ravenswood appeared
greatly shocked impossible we
have only one stranger here

  came to-day didnt he

 why yes he-

  hes the one glidden drew arm-

strong in and closed the door he
still is here isnt he

  why yes the man is in his room
but-

  show us the way well do the

rest he-

  one moment ravenswood barred
the way to the stairs protesting firmly
with a tinge of sarcasm in his voice
you detectives may be mistaken i
suppose it is possible that even you
detective glidden may be mistaken
maybe but not this time glidden
growled impatiently we have a
cinch case against him come come
mr barnard show us to his room
well if i must ravenswood
yielded with seeming reluctance but
let there be no disturbance no violence

  there wont be glidden cut in
well take him as quietly as a baby
takes a bottle get a move on

  this way then but please be quiet
the house will be ruined gentlemen
if this leaks out

  well choke that off also its
enough for us to get our man

  this way then he has our best
back room the door is ajar i see
and i think he is reading yes-see
for yourselves

  ravenswood opened the door while
speaking neither detective saw that
the key was on the outside the large
square room was brightly lighted
above the top of a large armchair
near the fireplace well across the room
the back of which was turned squarely
toward the door could be seen the top
of a mans head-that of the victim-
ized bank messenger then deeply
drugged and wholly insensible

  ignorant of the last of course both
detectives rushed into the room to seize
him-when ravenswoods voice rang
out like a trumpet

  stop all hands up-or therell be
a dead dick here

  both detectives had caught sight of
the return of red raven



the senseless man and both swung
around as if electrified then their
hands went into the air

 ravenswood stood erect on the
threshold his disguise gone one hand
on the partly closed door th other
covering both officers with his re-
volver  he laughed derisively and a
half-choked roar broke from glidden

  good heaven he cried its
ravenswood-that red raven leader

  right ravenswoods voice had a
vicious snap ive not forgotten
glidden that day on the aviation field
heres where i hand you one you
see that even you glidden may blun-
der and be mistaken is this what you
call a cinch case

 blast you-

  oh theres nothing in that ra-
venswood laughed scornfully theres
your man your absconder glidden-
but the red ravens did the job and
have their plunder the broad street
fighters were red ravens the pencil
vender was another the taxi driver
is another you see glidden i fixed

a soft trail for you-and you fell for
it ill make sure that the force and
the press learn all about it come and
get us glidden you know how to
catch a bird put salt on his tail

  ravenswood did not linger longer
he closed the door with the last and
quickly turned the key then darted
down the hall stairs he heard what
he was expecting-the crash of both
detectives against the door and then
the bang of a revolver and the splin-
tering of one of the panels he ran
down to the front door and called to
the policeman

  glidden wants you ijp there hes
in a fight with three crooks in the back
room

  the policeman rushed in and tore
up the stairs at top speed

  ravenswood turned to the parlor
door and threw off his smoking gown

  now paddy my coat and hat he
said quickly this way out lad and
lively to the taxi fallon will whisk
us to cover glidden has his man-
but we have the sixty thousand

man who could not remember crime probated

though edward burke pleaded guilty of burglary at sacramento cali-
fornia recently he will not go to prison for his offense instead he will be
sent to an institution where he will be treated for the affliction which is believed to
have brought him within the shadow of penitentiary walls

    burke was convicted of having burglarized the room of florence adamson
last august policemen caught him as he emerged from the room with a
revolver in his hand he made no effort at resistance

    it was claimed that burke committed the crime while his mind was a blank
he steadily professed to have had no recollection of the occurrence character
witnesses came to his defense testimony was submitted showing that on
several other occasions he had lost all memory of prior events

    upon recommendation of the probation officer burke was placed on six
years probation by superior judge malcolm glenn he also is to be sent to an
institution for the treatment of inebriates

murder will out

when thomas jarvis with a
grim expression on his tightly
closed lips came into the
room there was a look of
curiosity on the faces of both louden
powers and andrew lampton

 the man who had been called
howard milmarsh was the only person
in the large circle about the massive
mahogany table who seemed not to be
interested he was sitting opposite
thorndyke flint his head bent for-
ward so that his chin almost rested on
his chest and his eyes fixed vacantly
upon the table

  now that we are all here you may
go said flint dismissing the two men-
servants

  dont we have anything to drink
asked louden powers or is this to
be a dry session 

  we wont drink replied flint
but i dont think it will be so very
dry we shall see

  flint did not say anything more until
dobbs and kelly had withdrawn then
he made a motion to his assistant jud-
son who locked the door and handed
the key to his chief

  now mr jarvis well hear you
first announced flint wfiat are you
here for

im here to take possession of my

property replied jarvis i have had
my attorney go through all the neces-
sary legal forms and i demand that you
all leave this house forthwith

  louden powers and andrew lamp-
ton laughed aloud and even judson and
ray norton indulged in a quiet smile

  i dont think there is anything to be
said about that mr jarvis except to
inform you that howard milmarsh is
here and that therefore your claim is
nothing at all your attorney should
have known that

 im my own attorney snapped
jarvis i have been a lawyer long
enough to know my rights

 your knowledge of law may be
fairly good-very good returned the
detective but the action of law must
be based on sound facts and it seems as
if you have overlooked them i tell you
that howard milmarsh is here to claim
his inheritance

  you mean that man at the table
barked jarvis he is not howard
milmarsh

  youre wrong interposed louden
powers thats just who he is
billings had been gazing curiously at
the man powers pointed te and who
still sat with bent head taking no part
in the proceedings and seeming hardly
to know that he was there

thorndyke flint understood what
was passing in the big truckmans mind
there are things that seem to you
a battle for right



contradictory billings said flint as
their eyes met for a moment i will
explain to you later you will find that
i told you the truth

  bonesy billings shook his head in an
embarrassed way as he answered
hastily

  i hadnt no thought of nothing else
mr flint but i saw that gentleman
over there and i didnt know what it
meant

  now that is all i have to say in-
terrupted jarvis this is my house
and i should like to have it to myself
in the absence of any other legal heir

i am the owner the property passes
all to me as next of kin my son
would have inherited it had he lived
but he died

  he was killed suddenly thundered
flint he was struck down by a
champagne bottle there are witnesses
to prove it i have one of them in this

room-

  now flint interrupted captain
brown jumping to his feet you have
kept that quiet all these years why

should-

  ill tell you why captain brown
broke in the detective there is an
effort on the part of thomas jarvis to
rob the owner of this property of his
rights and i am obliged to say what i
do in the interests of justice
justice

  it was louden powers and andrew
lampton who uttered this word in uni-
son in an apprehensive tone there
seemed to be something about it that
grated on their sensibilities

  thomas jarvis was sitting stiff in his
chair his eyes fixed upon flints face
while he tried to mumble some protest

  i intended to keep this a secret to
the end because i have always felt that
the slayer of richard jarvis had great
provocation and doubtless was carried
away by the excitement of the moment
to do a deed that he has been remorse-
ful for ever since

  didnt it come out at the time
asked bonesy billings murders dont
often get away from the police in these
days

  youre right billings i dont sup-
pose this would have been hushed up if
a person who-who has some influence
had not prevented all the facts becom-
ing known

  id let it go at that if i were you
flint pleaded captain brown his usu-
ally bronzed face a grayish white
theres no sense in raking up such a
thing as this

  yes there is rejoined flint jar-
vis here has challenged me and i will
take it up he claims this property
is-

  it is mine put in jarvis doggedly
  because your son is dead

  yes

  and when you knew that howard
milmarsh had run away from this part
of the country you figured that he
never would dare return and that your
son richard would be the heir

  you can say what you like the
property is mine growled jarvis as
if determined to stick to one idea

  if your son richard were to die it
would leave you the next of kin so far
as legal forms go therefore it might
be to your interest if richard were to
be put out of the world he was not
really your son you know but your
stepson

  how did you know that de-
manded jarvis half rising it isnt
true anyhow	

  oh yes it is i can prove it if
necessary was the detectives answer
you knew that howard milmarsh the
elder was in poor health you had
learned that his doctor gave him only
a few more months of life and pre-
dicted that he would die suddenly all
that was part of your knowledge

  i dont care to stay here any longer
abruptly declared thomas jarvis rising
to his feet i will go but there will


detective story magazine

be proper officers here during the day to
eject the rascals who are trying to steal
my estate good morning

  but the door was locked and the key
in thorndyke flints pocket

  better sit down till i have finished
speaking he advised coolly i do not
intend to let you leave this room until
i am ready

  what do you mean

  ill tell the rest of my story and
then you can answer your own ques-
tion you will know what i mean
rot

  thomas jarvis resumed his seat and
stared at the detective those about the
table observed that he seemed to have
grown very much older in the last min-
ute or two his eyes had become dull
his jaw sagged and he did not appear
to be as truculent as he had been when
he came into the room

  the truth is went on flint that
you killed your son richard in a quar-
rel in the old pike inn-

  flint protested captain brown
this will ruin my house

 you knocked him down with a
champagne bottle as he came toward
you to strike you he fell flat with his
head against the corner of the iron
fender but the blow against the
fender was a trifle it glanced and
hardly cut the skin the stroke that
killed him was delivered by the cham-
pagne bottle in your hand

  bonesy billings captain brown
louden powers and lampton were all
on their feet in their excitement the
man who was supposed to be howard
milmarsh and thomas jarvis were the
only persons who remained in their
chairs judson and ray norton had
both arisen as if to prevent any demon-
stration by powers or lampton

 sit down commanded flint
there is nothing to be done the
man who killed richard jarvis cannot
escape

  the others dropped into their seats

again the two crooks showed more
terror than had been in their faces since
first they knew flint was in the house
if this shrewd deep-seeing detective
could wind the toils so easily about
thomas jarvis for a crime committed
years ago why would he not put them
in cells for offenses of yesterday as it
were 

 both louden powers and andrew
lampton were uneasy it is true that
the latter had practically a promise of
safety if he delivered t burton potter
into the hands of the detective but he
was not prepared to produce potter ex-
cept as a last resort to keep himself out
of prison

  as for louden powers he was a bold
scoundrel and he intended to make a
desperate fight to get away if he found
flint and his men closing in on him
only he wished he were not locked in
a room like this with the odds in num-
bers against him

  theres flint and his two men he
mused captain brown i guess and
that big billings that would be five
against one-for i dont suppose i could
count on that weak-kneed lampton
he has some sort of pull on the detec-
tive i wouldnt mind betting hes a
squealer 

  now mr jarvis continued flint
you have forced me to take this ac-
tion if you had not attempted to cash
in your crime i should have been in-
clined to let it- rest in the oblivion to
which you thought it consigned the
fact that you have compelled me to re-
mind you of it in the presence of these
witnesses emphasizes the world-old
truth that murder will out what have
you to say 

  there was no answer thomas jar-
vis gaze was fixed on the opposite wall
and he had slumped curiously down in
his large armchair

  look here flint broke in captain
brown again you dont have to drag
me into this
a battle for right



  you were a witness replied flint
coldly as a good citizen your duty
is to tell the truth-if you are asked

  it has been remarked already that
captain brown was a business man
he thought more of the old pike inn
and its reputation than anything else
on earth probably he groaned at
flints suggestion

  chief suddenly shouted judson

  he and norton rushed to thomas
jarvis simultaneously but they were
not in time to prevent his slipping to
the floor

  half a minute later as flint on one
knee by the side of the prostrate man
with a finger on the stilled pulse looked
up and said solemnly

  you need not worry about being
called on to testify captain brown
the matter will never come up

  is he dead

  the response of the detective was to
reverently cover the face of thomas
jarvis with his own handkerchief

chapter xxxiii

still hunting

f course thomas jarvis never was a
real factor in this matter re-
marked flint fifteen minutes later
when all that was mortal of jarvis had
been removed to another room but
we will go into the claims of that young
man who has been sitting silently at the
other side of the table from the begin-
ning of the conference and who-

  the detective broke off the chair
occupied by the man who had been de-
clared by louden powers and andrew
lampton to be howard milmarsh was
empty and he was not in the room

  norton and judson had both helped
remove the body of thomas jarvis and
no one had taken any notice of the
young man he had been sitting there
when everybody else went out watch-
ing the disposal of the still form on a
large sofa in the library

  they were just returning with flint
in the lead and speaking as he came
when he saw that the alleged howard
milmarsh had disappeared

  there was a search all about the
house and grounds which lasted for an
hour or more at the end of that time
when not a trace of the missing man
could be found flint decided that there
was nothing more to be done there
and he told judson and norton pri-
vately that he was going back to new
york

  louden powers and andrew lamp-
ton had both taken an active part in the
hunt they were loud in their pro-
testations that he was the real heir and
that somebody must have spirited him
away in the interests of enemies

  what do you mean by enemies
asked flint quietly when the whole
party were again assembled in the
dining room do you mean that per-
sons who believe him to be actually
howard milmarsh have hidden him so
that they can bring a spurious one in
to take possession

  you guess well grinned louden
powers

  mind i dont guess a little too well
for your peace of mind powers was
flints rejoinder this estate has not
been settled yet besides those people
waiting at the station for billings might
come up here again and hold you per-
sonally responsible for the fraud of
paradise city they count you partly
in the swindle as you know

  powers sniffed scornfully and
lighted a cigarette to show how much
at his ease he was andrew lampton
was discreetly silent he had not the
bravado of his companion

  the crowd has gone back an-
nounced ray norton who had been at
the telephone they got tired of wait-
ing for bonesy and they took that train
which went out an hour ago its lucky
for these two guys that they didnt come
back the station agent tells me they


detective story magazine

was as hot as fresh tamales if it
hadnt been a three-mile walk some of
em was coming back to lick the pair
of em just for luck

  gone eh exclaimed bonesy bil-
lings

  it is just as well put in flint
come over here billings i want to
talk to you

  the result of a minute or two of pri-
vate converse between the detective and
billings was that the big truckman
smiled grimly and stood by the door of
the dining room to indicate that he was
ready to obey orders at once

  you see judson explained flint to
his principal assistant i want you to
come back with me to new york and
it would be asking too much of norton
to guard those two men alone

  he could do it all right returned
judson i dont think they would get
away if ray wanted to hold them be-
sides there are menservants in the
house

  i dont depend on servants judson
-especially when they are new and
have no personal interest in the place
in which they are employed you re-
member we heard two of them talking
about their situation when they did not
suspect that they were overheard

  when we were behind that big pic-
ture 

  yes so ive engaged billings to
stay here and act as a sort of sergeant
at arms while we are away he and
norton together will insure louden
powers and andrew lampton being
here when we return

  what are we going to do about
howard milmarsh broke in louden
powers who had been wondering what
the detective was talking about but
could not very well inquire i think
id better go down to new york and
look around

  where would you look 

  in places where he generally hangs
out theres a lot of joints where you

could find him most any time and
i-

  i never knew howard milmarsh to
hang about in new york interrupted
flint i think you have somebody
else in mind

  who demanded powers defiantly
  t burton potter for instance

  im talking about howard mil-
marsh

  well we will let you remain in the
house here while i look for howard
milmarsh im quite as anxious as you
are to find him was flints reply
come on judson

  you want andrew lampton and me
to stay here asked powers with a
suspicious inflection thats some-
thing different from what youve been
giving us you were handing it to us
that we had no business in this house
you have business in it now lou-
den because i believe you may help
to solve the problem of the missing heir
captain brown you will take us down
to the station wont you my car has
gone back to new york

  ill take you down with pleasure
was the prompt response of the man-
ager of the old pike inn

  captain brown was so relieved to
know that he would not be called on as
a witness to prove that thomas jarvis
killed his son that he was willing to
do anything for anybody

  ill go with you if you like volun-
teered lampton even if i cant find
howard milmarsh i might get my
hands on t burton potter you re-
member you wanted me to find him
i did want you to do that admit-
ted flint but not now im in hopes
that i can find him myself even if i
dont it wont make much difference as
things have turned out you remain
here with louden powers billings you
know what to do you too ray
thorndyke flin and judson swung
out of the dining room with captain
brown no sooner were they outside
a battle for right



than the door closed and they heard a
key click in the lock

  ray norton and billings are not
taking any chances observed judson
smiling

  that is the only way to deal with
men of that stripe judson captain
if we hurry we can make that two train
for new york

  they just made the train and as
flint and his assistant sat silently side
by side while the train rushed toward
the metropolis each was occupied with
his own thoughts

  where shall be go first  asked
judson as they left the train at the
grand central and walked through the
lofty concourse to forty-second street
home i suppose

  yes well go there and see what
mail there is and if anything special
calls for attention then well visit the
universal hospital

  what do you suppose has become
of that fellow who vanished from the
house up there this morning-the man
who called himself howard mil-
marsh 

  that i dont know and i dont
much care at present but i should
like to correct you in one little par-
ticular judson it is louden powers
and andrew lampton who have been
calling him howard milmarsh you
did not hear him say much about it
thats true assented judson reflec-
tively heres a taxi i called him
up just now

  theres an old man and a young lady
waiting for you in the library sir said
the butler as they went into flints
quiet house i told them i didnt know
when you would be back but they said
they would wait half an hour anyhow
perhaps by that time you might be
home theyve been in the library an
hour already i was up there ten min-
utes ago

  they must want to see me rather
badly was flints comment as he ran

lightly up the stairs did they give
you their names

  no sir they said they would tell
you when they saw you

  very well

  flint opened the door of his library
as he stepped inside he knew who his
visitors were

  why its the young lady who was
in the fire that night he exclaimed in
a tone of warm welcome miss sil-
vius isnt it

  yes and this is my father if it
hadnt been for you we couldnt be here
now we wanted to see you so much
mr flint i didnt know till to-day
who it was that got us out of that fear-
ful fire i have not seen mr gordon-
i mean mr milmarsh-since

  flint shook hands with bessie silvius
and her father and then introduced
judson who thought the girl wonder-
fully pretty and showed it in his face

  i-i-wanted to thank you for what
you did mr flint faltered the girl
and also-to ask if you knew where
mr milmarsh is

  i know where he is replied flint
gravely

chapter xxxiv

the girl in the case

ill you take me to him asked
the girl with a blush then she
went on in a more resolute tone and as
if she knew she had nothing of which to
be ashamed he has asked me to
marry him mr flint

  ah

  yes thats what i told him she
continued innocently i said it could
never be

  i didnt say anything smiled the
detective

  i know you didnt at least you
only said ah but i know what you
meant and i agree with you

  i wish you would explain miss sil-
vius

  you mean that he is a multimil-


detective story magazine

lionaire if he chooses to claim his own
if i were to marry him people might
say he was throwing himself away on
a poor girl

  i dont think it would matter what
people might say

  it would matter a great deal to me
she interrupted with decision i am
getting a living by teaching music my
father teaches the violin we both play
when we get a chance and-and-
sometimes the places we play at are not
at all-at all nice

  poor girl murmured flint below
his breath then aloud we all have
to do things we dont like sometimes
miss silvius i can assure you know-
ing howard milmarsh as well as i do
that if he asked you to marry him
he will insist on your doing it-pro-
vided of course that you care for
him

  i do burst out the girl involun-
tarily then she blushed again t did
not mean to say that ive told him i
shall never marry and i intend to keep
my word

  no doubt girls always intend to
keep their word when they make a rash
assertion of that kind said flint with
a laugh you say you havent seen
him since the night of the fire

  no we were all so much excited
and my poor father who had rheuma-
tism was in such a dangerous state
that i was only too glad that some of
the neighbors took us in and cared for
us when i came to myself and could
make inquiries about mr gordon no
one knew where he was i couldnt
find any one who remembered seeing
him after he came down the ladder ex-
cept that a policeman said he was hurt
i took him away in my motor car
said flint quietly

  you did and is he well can
you take me to him is he here in
your house

  not at present but what made you
think of coming here to-day  why did

you connect me with the disappearance
of this-er-mr gordon

  the same policeman who told me he
was taken away in a motor car saw me
on the street this morning we have al-
ways been on speaking terms since the
fire he said to-day he had heard that
the motor car in which mr gordon-
as everybody called him where he lived
-was taken away belonged to the de-
tective thorndyke flint

  yes

  it was not difficult to find your ad-
dress so my father and i came down
to try to see you i was so disap-
pointed when your man said you were
away we had come a long way and i
was determined to see you if i could
so we said we would wait

  you have been here more than an
hour 

  yes but we didnt mind waiting so
long as you are here at last we should
have waited another hour and more
than that and if we had not seen you
to-day we should have been here again
to-morrow

  thats true sir added roscoe sil-
vius who had hardly spoken i cant
say all i should like but i dont think i
need speak my gratitude you surely
must know why mr flint you
plucked me out of the very jaws of a
horrible death

  im very glad i happened to be
there returned flint earnestly at
such a time as that any man would have
done what i did mr-er-gordon
was as active as i was

  yes but he couldnt have done it
alone although i saw that he would
have given his life to save us then
there is the young man over there at the
other side of the room-mr judson
i remember how he helped to get my
father down that ladder when it was
breaking in the middle i wish i could
say something to him that would seem
only partly adequate

  dont say anything miss silvius
a battle for right



put in judson blushing like a girl him-
self it was the chief who did it
i only helped him a little and-and-it
was all in my days work nothing to
talk about

  well now mr flint will you take
me to him asked the girl going back
to her former request

  i should hardly like to do that with-
out first seeing him answered the de-
tective kindly you see-

  he is still ill isnt that it mr
flint

  there was an agony of anxiety in
her voice that caused it to tremble as
she looked eagerly into his face

  yes he is ill admitted flint i
am going to see him at the hospital 
is-is he very bad

  i dont know i do not think so
the last time i saw him some days
ago he was up and dressed the trou-
ble is with his mind the shock of the
injuries he suffered at the fire still af-
fects him i hope-and expect-it will
soon pass away

  i wish i could see him

  in intend that you shall-but not
just now

 when

  let me see it is now four oclock
i will go to the hospital you may have
an opportunity this evening i cannot
promise but it may be so will you re-
main here until i get back you have
spent over an hour in this room he
added smiling you wont mind an-
other half hour or so im sure

  how kind you are she murmured
not at all as judson says it is
all in my days work

  judson brought a bundle of maga-
zines to her and placed a chair for her
at the big table with another for her
father

  flint smiled inwardly as he noted the
assiduous attentions of his assistant
bessie silvius liras a pretty girl

  with a cheerful nod of farewell to
bessie and her father and another for

judson the detective went out picked
up a taxi at the next corner and sped
away to the universal hospital

  he knew his way about the big build-
ing and did not require anybody to
show him how to reach the private room
he had engaged for howard milmarsh
it was on the fourth floor and there
was good elevator service in fact
there were two passenger elevators be-
sides others for taking patients on cots
from one floor to another and for other
hospital uses

  most of the doctors and nurses knew
him and he had to stop and speak to
several of them before he was allowed
to enter the elevator and tell the attend-
ant to put him off on the fourth

  as he walked down the long corridor
on his way to the room he met the
nurse who was in charge of howard
milmarsh at night

  how is he miss jordan asked
flint

  he had a good night mr flint
but i havent seen him since seven this
morning

  his mind

  i fancy it is better he seems to re-
member things a little i feel sure he
will quite recover in time

  this nurse had had long experience
comparatively she was nearly thirty
years of age and was considered one
of the most competent of her profession
in the hospital when she said a pa-
tient was better there was reason to be-
lieve she was right

  im glad to hear it miss jordan
were you going to see him now

  yes i dont go on till seven but
as i am in the hospital ill go in of
course to see my patient i am deeply
interested in the case it is a sad one
it seems to me for i hear that he is a
very wealthy man

  miss jordan looked inquiringly at
flint but if she expected to receive
any information from him as to how-
ard milmarshs private affairs she was


detective story magazine

disappointed the detective was not
given to idle gossip

  the young man was known in the
hospital as robert gordon if he had
been entered in the name of howard
milmarsh there would have been alto-
gether too much curiosity about him in
flints opinion

  the two reached the door of the pri-
vate room and miss jordan tapped at
the door

  it was opened quickly and flint saw
that there were three doctors and as
many nurses standing between him and
the bed and all were talking with more
excitement than is usual in a sick
chamber

  is anything the matter demanded
flint

  hes gone  replied one of the doc-
tors with a jerk the patient has left
the hospital and we are questioning
miss sawyer the day nurse to find out
how it happened

  gone echoed flint sharply do
you mean he ran away without any-
body knowing he had done so

  no no mr flint not so bad as
that such a thing could not happen in
a well-managed institution like the uni-
versal hospital but he went for a
stroll about the building and on the
lawn and slipped out of the front door
without anybody in the office on the
main floor noticing him that is the
report

  oh thats the report is it ob-
served flint dryly

chapter xxxv

getting to a focus

f you mean that he was allowed to
go walking about the hospital by
himself so that he could slip away un-
noticed 

  it was flint asking the question and
he was seated in the room from which
howard milmarsh had vanished talk-
ing to the day nurse miss sawyer

while the night nurse miss jordan
listened

  i did not say that replied miss
sawyer his brother was here

  his brother

  yes he was the very picture of
mr gordon-except that he was not
pale from staying indoors like the pa-
tient in everything else they were so
much alike that you knew they were
twins

  oh you knew it

  yes you could tell it from their
remarkable resemblance to each other
besides the other mr gordon said they
were twins

  had you ever seen the visiting
brother before

  no

  he had never paid a visit to the pa-
tient till to-day did he explain why
that was 

  yes he said he had been away
from new york for a long time-in the
west he had heard of his brother
being -sick and had come to the hos-
pital as soon as he arrived in the city
and then-what

  he talked to mr gordon for a- little
while trying to make him understand
he spoke of being in the west and
mentioned a place he called maple
well

  mr gordon appeared to recognize
that name for he smiled and said some-
thing that sounded like a girls name
what name

  bessie or letty or nelly i could
not be sure what it was for he does not
talk plainly you know he never has
had complete control of his tongue since
he came here

  was that all you noticed when they
were talking was there any other
word that seemed to penetrate to his
brain 

  not that i saw they talked for
about fifteen minutes then mr gor-
don as he said his name was-the vis-
itor-proposed that he should walk his
a battle for right



brother about the hospital and out to
the garden at the back

  and you let him do it

  yes it seemed reasonable that they
should like to be together after so long
a parting reasonable for the visitor
that is the patient did not make any
sign one way or the other beyond a
half smile as if he were pleased when
the name of the girl was on his tongue
he was just as he always is

  it might have been better if youd
gone along too miss sawyer re-
marked the detective you would then
have seen them when they went out of
the front door the patient had his
hat i suppose

  yes he wore his usual clothing
hat and all there was nothing in his
appearance different from hundreds of
men you may see on broadway or fifth
avenue at any time i wish i had gone
with them but i argued that he would
be quite safe with his twin brother
and his absence gave me an opportunity
to look after little things about the room
which are difficult to attend to when he
is there

  flint saw the nurses point of view
and resolved not to make a complaint at
the office as he might easily have done
instead he walked out stepped into his
waiting taxicab and hastened home

  he told exactly what he had found
at the hospital leaving it to judson to
make any comments that occurred to
him

  the girl and her father simply looked
bewildered they did not feel that any
harm had been done by the patient leav-
ing the hospital with his twin brother
indeed bessie smiled as if pleased that
he was well enough to go out

  you know who the twin brother is
of course chief  observed judson

  it is not hard to guess

  what is the game 

  that we must find out

  when 

 now

  where are you going to do it
the milmarsh residence it appears
to me replied flint

  milmarsh did you say asked the
girl do you suppose he has gone
there 

  it seems probable

  so it does assented bessie silvius
oh mr flint perhaps he is quite
well-recovered his memory and every-
thing  well if he has that is all i
want to know it is all i have a right
to know well go now my father and
i you wont mind my coming again-
to-morrow or the next day-to hear
how he is will you

  the pitiful appeal in her tones would
have touched a much harder heart than
the detectives he walked close to her
and took one of her hands in his

  miss silvius i hope you will not
have to wait until to-morrow to hear
how mr-mr gordon is i was about
to ask if you would go with us to mil-
marsh

  milmarsh

  that is the name of the little place
where the residence of the milmarshes
is up on the hill there is not much else
there besides the old pike inn and a
cluster of small stores to supply the
country homes around we shall take a
train in three-quarters of an hour

  it will get us up there in less than
an hour added- judson its an ex-
press the chief has that train schedule
down fine he never has to look at a
time-table

  meanwhile i will have the house-
keeper give us a meal of some kind
she is a wonder at preparing a tasty
luncheon or supper at short notice

  i dont think im hungry protested
the girl

  i know better contradicted flint
smiling as he saw that judson was al-
ready at the house telephone giving di-
rections to the housekeeper and your
father needs something too you
wouldnt deprive him of the refresh-


detective story magazine

ment he needs i am sure even if you
were to refuse it for yourself

  thus chatting to prevent bessie sil-
vius objecting further flint led the way
into the dining room where in a won-
derfully short space of time there were
tea coffee cold meat cake pie and
other articles of food set forth in appe-
tizing array

  roscoe silvius evidently was hungry
the old gentleman attacked everything
set before him and praised each dish as
it reached him bessie also was hun-
gry although she was not so ravenous
as her father while flint and judson
disposed of their food in the business-
like manner of sensible men who did
not know when they would get a meal
again and were determined to make the
most of the one they had

  the taxi that was to take them to the
grand central was at the door when
they went downstairs and they were
comfortably seated in a parlor car two
minutes before the time for the train to
pull out

  it all seems so wonderful declared
bessie smiling as she settled down in
the comfortable roomy chair and
looked along the car this morning i
had no thought of finding him again in
this world now in the evening i am
on my way to see him

  you are almost too optimistic im
afraid said flint with a smile we
may not find him at milmarsh only i
think that he may be there i have
reasons of my own for believing so
but they may all turn out fallacious
there goes the train

  in less than an hour they were in a
motor car hired at the station and on
their way up to the milmarsh mansion

  hello  whats all the fuss on the
porch exclaimed judson look
chief it isnt the poor people that
were fooled on paradise city there
again is it

  i see billings moving about very

actively said flint- hurry driver
lets get there

  the chauffeur put on more power
and sent his machine along at a head-
long pace which brought it up in front
of the porch at the main door with a
rush

  what is it shouted flint at ray
norton who was by the side gf the big
truckman

  the guy they called howard mil-
marsh is back again was the reply
hurled back by norton

chapter xxxvi

where they found him

dlintjumped out of the car leav-
ing to judson the congenial task of
helping out bessie silvius and bolted
into the house

  where is he

  in the dining room locked in with
the others reported billings coolly
as soon as he came snooping up i
shoved him in with louden powers and
lampton and let them have it out
between them then i came out to
see who it was coming up the road in
an automobile it was you the other
guy came only just a little while ago
you mean the man you have in the
dining room

  yes he said he walked up from
the station talking to another fellow
who was with him when suddenly he
missed him

 who

the other guy he was talking to
do you mean to say that he allowed
a man to get away from him while they
were actually talking and didnt see
where hed gone 

  thats what he told told us

  i dont believe it for one put in
judson

  unless this mug in the dining room
is daffy then it might have hap-
pened suggested norton who is he
anyhow 
a battle for right



  flint did not stop to answer although
he could have done it he went over
to bessie silvius and asked her to wait
in the drawing-room with her father
for a little time while he straightened
out a little misunderstanding that had
occurred

  but mr flint is that mr gordon
in the dining room i mean the man
they say came walking up the road with
somebody else or was it he who sud-
denly left the other

  i shall have to go into the dining
room to see the man before i can an-
swer that question

  he directed judson to stay in the
drawing-room with bessie and her fa-
ther it was a mission that judson un-
dertook with cheerfulness flint saw
him leading bessie and roscoe silvius
to the drawing-room with chester-
fieldian politeness and did not trouble
any further about him

  billings opened the door of the dining
room with the key he had in his pocket
and flint went in

  he saw just about what he expected
louden powers and andrew lampton
each had a cigar going and between
them still slumped down in his chair
as if he never had moved was the in-
dividual who had been put forward as
the real heir of the stupendous mil-
marsh estate

  flint went to this man and shook him
until he looked up vacantly

  where is he demanded flint

  i dont know i was bringing him
here because you wanted him but he
wouldnt come the whole distance and
it was no fault of mine i guess he is
somewhere about the grounds

  why didnt you search for him in-
stead of coming up to the house
because i believed hed come here
it is what anybody would have believed
but as soon as i came up to the porch
some of these fellows of yours saw me
and dragged me into this room

  the speaker was not exactly stupid

he seemed to be rather dazed by a rapid
surge of events that was the way
flint regarded him and doubtless he
was right he bent over and whispered
in the mans ear

  the result was a brightening up and
a much firmer tone of voice as he said-
aloud

  of course ill go with you and i
reckon i can find him too but you
will have to keep these two men off
me pointing to powders and lampton
they feel that things are slipping away
from them and they will kill me if they
have a chance

  that is quite probable murmured
the detective inaudibly

  flint led the cowed man out of the
room and saw that norton followed
he turned to his young assistant and
told him not to let anybody out of the
house till they returned

  once in the open air flints com-
panion seemed to become a different
man his step was springy and when
they came to a fence separating them
from a part of the grounds that was full
of high grass and tangled shrubbery he
vaulted over it as lightly and cleanly as
flint himself his voice was almost
firm as he said

  i saw him looking over here as we
came up the road and once i heard
him mutter something about the west
meadow he seemed to know that part
of the estate although i did not hear
him say anything else

  the west meadow repeated flint
yes i think i know where that is
they walked for some little distance
through the bushes and grass until
flint stopped and pointed to what was
evidently a recent trail

  see somebody has walked through
this high grass and made a deep wide
furrow we shant have much trouble
in finding him now i think

  perhaps flint was surprised to find
that the trail ended at the stone founda-
tion wall of the house at the back


detective story magazine

where the cover of the tunnel that used
to be part of the underground railway
was made to look like the surrounding
stones this tunnel has already been
described

  get in there commanded flint

- this man was not inclined to obey
he seemed to fear it meant getting him
at a disadvantage-perhaps locking him
up in some dungeon from which he
might never emerge save to go into a
regular prison

  but flint was not in a mood to be
held back by anybody-least of all by
one whom lie felt had no right to con-
sideration

  so the man went down the chute just
as judson had not so long before and
flint followed him

  there is no necessity to tell bit by bit
how they went along the secret corridor
which finally brought them to the back
of the large picture in the dining room
where flint and his assistant had
listened to the conversation of the con-
spirators-one of whom was now actu-
ally in the corridor himself

  suddenly a man sprang out of the
blackness and seized flint by the throat
forcing him backward and almost to his
knees

  it was only for an instant that the de-
tective was held at a disadvantage he
hurled his assailant away and bringing
out his pocket flash saw the man who
had come with him lying on the floor in
the narrow space while facing him
with wild vengeful eyes was the sick
man from the universal hospital

  it was evident that the escaped pa-
tient did not recognize either flint or
the other man and equally certain that
he regarded them both as enemies

  even as the detective watched he
could see the long fingers leah and
clawlike from long illness twitching to
get at his throat while the madmans
jieet shuffled slightly as if preparing for
a sudden spring

  flint took the initiative telling the

man on the floor to get up and lend a
hand he threw one arm around the
strange creature who had found his way
in some mysterious way to this secret
corridor and seized his wrist from be-
hind by this wrestling trick the de-
tective had both the hands of his cap-
tive firmly held

  hold him for a moment he com-
manded the other man who had arisen
by this time poor fellow  he is too
weak to resistmuch had you any no-
tion where he was 

  how could i have was the re-
joinder in an injured tone i never
was in this hole before where are we
anyhow 

  ill show you replied flint

  he felt along the wall until his finger
touched a small knob

  the next moment a panel turned open
silently and they were looking through
a doorway some four feet wide down
into the dining room where sat the men
they had left there half an hour before

  a shriek of horror burst from an-
drew lampton but louden powers
only smiled derisively he had an iron
nerve and nothing could surprise him
very much he had always known
there were secret passages about this
strange old house although he never
had found them for himself

  the appearance of the two ghostly
personages in the bedchamber on that
night had confirmed what he had heard
about the hidden places in the house
so it did not seem so very extraordinary
that flint should suddenly show himself
in the wall by two of the large pic-
tures

  at first only flint was visible to the
people in the dining room but as flint
stepped forth upon a chair and thus
to the floor he led the escaped sick man
from the hospital while following him
was the person the two conspirators had
declared to be howard milmarsh

  what chief shouted ray norton
in delight did you get him
a battle for right



  by hooky  roared bonesy billings
theres two of em they look just
alike now i know how you told the
truth mr flint while it looked like-
like the other thing

  the detective only nodded as he put
a large chair for the pale-faced invalid
and forced him into it gently

  the belligerence had gone from the
face of the newcomer he seemed to be
wondering-that was all

  the most peculiar thing in the whole
affair was that the man who had been
set forth as the real owner of the mil-
marsh estate and who had appeared so
dazed and in such terror of powers and
lampton now held up his head and
actually smiled as if a great weight
had been lifted from his shoulders

  louden powers scowled at him but
he replied only by a stare of defiance

  that mug is going to give the whole
snap away muttered andrew lamp-
ton in the ear of his fellow conspirator

  til kill him if he does whispered
back louden powers

chapter xxxvii

this rightful heir

dring in that young lady and her
father with judson ordered the
detective as he swung the secret panel
shut and nodded to ray norton

  gi me the key bonesy

  billings unlocked the door and while
ray was absent he stood guard not
that it was needed for nobody made an
attempt to get out

  here they are chief cried ray
as he came in with the three persons he
had been sent for

  the girl would have run to the sick
man as soon as she saw him and it
could be seen that a cry of recognition
was ready to spring from her lips

  not yet warned flint patience
for a just a moment

she nodded obediently and sank into

the chair judson set for her her fa-
ther bewildered was already seated

  now gentlemen went on the de-
tective in the first place i will ask
this man who has been posing as how-
ard milmarsh what his name really is
what is the use of my saying
grumbled the man he addressed you
know it and of course these other fel-
lows do he pointed to louden pow-
ers and andrew lampton they
thought it was a slick game and that
we could get away with the bluff i
knew we couldnt

  you could if youd had any nerve
snarled louden powters but you
never could see a thing through you
are all right at the beginning but you
havent the pluck to stay with a thing
to the end youre like a wet fire-
cracker theres a whiz and a puff
and youre done you make me sick
t burton potter

  potter smiled he did not care what
was said now that the truth had come
out

  then if this guys name is potter

the other one must be- began

bonesy billings

  flint held up a hand to silence him
then he whispered to bessie silvius

  yes mr flint she answered aloud
i believe hell know me- ill try
him

  she stepped over to the man who had
spent so long a time in the universal
hospital and laid a hand on his arm
he started and looked at her

  bob she whispered dont you
know me 

  it was very difficult for him to draw
his senses together but it could be seen
that her voice had touched a responsive
chord in his being he held out his
hand to her

 as she took it he murmured
brokenly

  bob gordon yes that is what
they call me but-but-it isnt quite
right how is it-bessie

  she laughed half hysterically

  did you hear that mr flint he
knows me he called me by my name
he is coming to himself

  the detective shook his head doubt-
fully he was willing to admit that re-
membering the girls name was a good
sign but it was not enough

  let me try he said

 touching the young man on the
shoulder he bent over and whispered
sharply in his ear

  howard milmarsh

  there was a slight movement but
it could not be said that the name had
brought him to his senses he slumped
down in his chair again and in a weary
voice murmured bessie

the only thing he can think of re-
marked judson hes a lucky man
i dont see where the luck comes in
if hes off his nut rejoined ray nor-
ton

  bonesy billings judson and ray
norton were all gathered about him
each one watching for some other in-
dications of returning intelligence be-
sides that contained in the single word
bessie	

  it was this moment of which louden
powers took advantage with a sign
to lampton louden crept toward the
door

  but flint was on the alert even
though so deeply engaged

  not yet louden he shouted as
he rushed forward to cut off the ras-
cals escape

  get back roared powers youd
better if you dont want to get this

  he had picked up a heavy cut-glass
water bottle from the table and was
swinging it around his head

  flint dashed at him and louden let
the bottle go with all his force

  the detective ducked and the bottle
went past

  a shriek from bessie silvius made
him turn quickly

 howard milmarsh-the real one-

was lying back in his chair and a thin
red stream trickled over his forehead

  get that fellow shouted flint
over his shoulder as he rushed to the
wounded man crumpled up in the big
armchair

  ive got him all right replied
bonesy billings

  billings had backheeled louden
powers just as he got to the door and
now was kneeling on the chest of the
discomfited scoundrel

  lampton scared was in his chair
he had jumped up when louden tried
to get away then seeing that the at-
tempt would fail he prudently resumed
his seat in a hurry

  flint was examining the wound put-
ting his handkerchief to it and noting
at the same time that the sufferer was
talking rapidly

  it just caught him with a glancing
stroke announced the detective it
jarred him but that is all it is not
serious just enough of a concussion

  he stopped and looked around him
with a hopeful look in his keen dark
eyes

  whats this the wounded man was
saying in a natural though weak
voice are we off the roof is the
fire still burning we didnt go
through did we wheres bessie

  here i am here i am she an-
swered eagerly

  he took her hand and stared into
her face then he smiled this time
it was with as much intelligence as her
own

 mr flint mr flint she
screamed

  yes

  he has got back his senses look
at him

  do you know who you are asked
flint close to him

 howard milmarsh to you mr
flint howard milmarsh what is
the use of my saying my name is any-
a battle for right



thing else you know me i dont
care who knows it now anyhow i
had determined to give myself up i
killed richard jarvis

  no you didnt youre mistaken
you did not kill him declared the de-
tective emphatically you will take
my word wont you

  take your word mr flint of
course i will-i must but are you
sure 

  of course im sure i can prove
it

  then is richard jarvis alive

  no but he died by an accident-
after he had quite recovered from the
blow you gave him it was only a
knock-out he came to in a few min-
utes you were scared unnecessarily
now you will come into your own
but-my father ah yes i know
my poor father

  tears-real comforting natural
tears-flowed from his eyes they
would have proved if there had been
nothing else that howard milmarsh
was again himself and that he was pre-
pared to face whatever might be his
fate

  flint turned away to see what
bonesy was doing to the prostrate curs-
ing louden powers

  take him away billings lock him
up in a cellar till the police come

  as bonesy billings promptly obeyed
by yanking louden powers to his feet
as if he had been a sack of oats an-
drew lampton exclaimed in a terrified
tone

  police have you sent for the po-
lice

  flint waited till louden powers was
out of the room then he went close
to lampton and spoke to him quietly
look here lampton i promised
that if you brought t burton potter to
me i would do something for you i
will keep my word by giving you half
an hours start of the police get out
id advise you to get over the canadian
a ds

border as soon as you can do it dont
ever show up in new york again if
you do i wont answer for the conse-
quences understand 

  andrew lampton did understand
he was out of the house almost before
the detective had finished speaking

  are you going to bring any charge
against me whimpered t burton
potter or may i go

  i know you are a crook potter but
in this case i recognize that you were
led into mischief by stronger wills than
your own your attempt to defraud
howard milmarsh of his rights would
mean perhaps ten years in sing sing
if the charge were pressed but you
helped me to find the right man at last
and i believe you are really sorry for
what you have done

 yes and--

  get out of this house interrupted
flint the same advice i gave to
andrew lampton applied to you lose
no time in jumping over the line into
canada you may escape that way
it is your own lookout go and may
you lead a better life in future

  i will returned t burton potter
earnestly i have had such a scare
this time that im through with crook-
edness for all time

  i hope thats true

  you bet its true insisted potter
as he hurried from the room

  it seems to me that youre letting
all the crooks get away chief pro-
tested-judson mildly i think both
potter and lampton ought to have been
handed over to the police with
powers

  strictly speaking according to the
law i suppose they should conceded
flint but i have to consider how-
ard milmarsh he has recovered his
senses it is true-thanks to that bottle
over there-but it will be some time be-
fore it will be safe to put him through
another mental strain

  i guess youre right


detective story magazine

  of course hes right put in ray
norton hes always right it seems
to me that you had a lot of nerve to tell
him he wasnt

  that will do interposed flint
smiling i cant afford to have my
two men-both of them the most loyal
lieutenants a man could have-arguing
over me

  but he said- blurted out nor-
ton

  i know what he said and he was
right in a way but there are circum-
stances that make it desirable that how-
ard milmarsh should take possession
of his estate with as little fuss as pos-
sible i promised his father that i
would see he was allowed to do so and
thats what i have to do

  it was three months after that excit-
ing night at the great milmarsh man-
sion on the hill another night of an
exciting nature may be mentioned the
excitement this time was of a much
more pleasant nature however the

wedding of howard milmarsh and
bessie silvius had just taken place

  thorndyke flint judson and norton
were all there together with billings-
who wore evening clothes for the first
and only time in his life judson had
been the best man at the ceremony and
a niece of captain browns was the
bridesmaid

  among the guests were all the peo-
ple who had been swindled over the
paradise city land project they had
all got back their money with a large
bonus to each person in addition and
now were there to cheer the finest man
who ever had lived in that part of the
country in their opinion howard mil-
marsh

  thats all right so far as it goes
remarked ray norton to judson sotto
voce but where would howard mil-
marsh have been to-day if it were not
for the chief

  thats so agreed judson how-
ard is like all of us he has to take off
his hat to thorndyke flint

 alfred plowman

it was saturday morning and the
hands on the dial of the great clock
in the main banking room of the
third national stood at half past
eleven

  before the windows of each of the
three paying tellers was a long line of
impatient customers cashiers of com-
mercial firms paymasters of factories
and the usual miscellany of the week-
end some had checks in their hands
which they fingered nervously some
shifted restlessly from foot to foot all
kept glancing impatiently down the
line half angry when a customer de-
layed a teller for a moment more than
seemed necessary

  the line before the window of teller
no i was unusually troublesome
teller no i as the brass sign in the
window announced was mr haskell
a middle-aged man with thinnish light
hair on the top of his head which
made his forehead seem very high he
had watery blue eyes a fair complex-
ion and when he was nervous or ex-
cited the blood would mount from his
throat to the high wall of his forehead
seeming to lose itself under the thin
strands of his carefully parted hair

  mr haskell was a bachelor had been
with the bank for many years and was
head paying teller because the other
tellers worked under him he occupied
cage no i and because cage no i
was nearest to the door mr haskell

handled more customers than any of
the other tellers

  on this saturday morning the line
before window no i was so trouble-
some that even such an experienced
teller as mr haskell was to be excused
for becoming peevish the next man
in line stepped up and pushed a check
under the bars good morning five
hundred in twenty-dollar gold pieces
mr haskell grunted and looked up
the man was paymaster of a large hat
factory confound it everybody
wants what i havent got wont
twenty-dollar bills do

  no the directors voted tokens of
appreciation to the old employees my
special instructions were to pay it in
gold 

  mr haskell glanced at his stack of
gold pieces i havent got it here ill
have to go down to the vault the
line moved angrily confound it all
look at the string-and almost
twelve he picked up his bunch of
keys and turned around-paused--then
threw the keys upon a desk in the cor-
ner of the cage where a young man sat
listing checks on an adding machine
go down to my vault moore and
bring up that sack of gold lying on the
floor just inside the door

  he turned to the window again
step aside please hell be back in a
moment the next man in line moved
up and laughed mr haskell looked


detective story magazine

at him saw that his eyes were directed
to the corner of the cage and glanced
around the assistant teller sat at his
desk immovable his hand poised over
the keyboard of the machine his eyes
fixed on the bunch of keys looks
like hes hypnotized said the man

  well well get busy moore or-
dered mr haskell sharply

  yes sir-yes sir and the young
man sprang up a frightened look on
his white face mr haskell eyed him
a moment undecided then turned re-
luctantly to the window again

  the young man pressed back the
spring lock on the door in the rear of
the cage and passed out he threaded
his way through the maze of book-
keepers desks the bunch of keys
clasped in his hand his eyes fixed
straight before him he knew now
that he would do it-knew that he had
always thought of doing it-knew that
he had only been waiting a favorable
moment the plan which had been
lurking in the hidden chambers of his
mind sprang into sudden birth and he
was powerless before the strong temp-
tation

  he passed down the steps to the
basement where the vaults were lo-
cated as he approached the bunch
of keys swinging from his hand the
watchman rolled back the iron gate and
admitted him to the vault room be-
fore him was an immense cavern with
the great door of many tons thrown
wide open he stepped inside-into the
money vault-into the very heart of
the bank

  the vault was divided into compart-
ments each a miniature vault in itself
guarded by a steel door which closed
with lock and key in some were kept
the reserve funds of the bank-cur-
rency and securities there was a com-
partment also for each of the tellers
and the first one on his right was mr
haskells he inserted the key into
the lock and threw open the door

when he had done this he was com-
pletely shielded from outside observa-
tion as the door of the subvault ex-
tended more than halfway across the
main entrance

  as he stood there packages of money
stacked high on the shelves-money in
sacks-bills gold silver-the very air
freighted with its odor-as he stood
thus a dizziness seized upon him im-
pulse-that destroyer of multitudes of
men-laid its hot hand upon his reason
he fought against it-hesitated-
yielded

  with eager trembling fingers he un-
buttoned his office coat then his vest
then his shirt he tightened the belt
around his waist reached up to the
topmost shelf and from the farthest
corner took a bundle of bills the top
one was for fifty dollars and upon the
bands which held the package together
was stamped two thousand dollars he
slipped the bundle inside his shirt and
reached up again then again and again
until he had seven packages pressed
close against his body

  afraid that more might bulk too
large and arouse suspicion he quickly
buttoned his shirt and vest and coat
ran his hands over himself to feel that
the bundles lay flat and even and
stooped to pick up the sack of gold

  in that moment of stooping a light-
ning flash of reason illumined the mad-
ness of his act outraged conscience
sprang up in arms he saw himself
a malefactor the hand of society
against him branded a felon by the law
lashed by the scourge of his own guilt
he straightened up and began to tear
open his coat then he heard voices
without the vault

  i say tom did you see moore
down here

  yes hes inside the vault replied
the watchman

  footsteps approached moore hastily
buttoned his coat and reached for the
sack of gold the head of an office
the letter in the mail



boy appeared in the doorway say
moore old haskells about to have a fit
upstairs he sent me to look for you
said the boy with a grin

  moore did not answer he closed
the door locked it and with the bag
of money in his hand he left the vault
fate had intervened one mad mo-
ment had changed the course of his life

  at the rattling of the cage door mr
haskell steppe back and released the
lock it took you a long time he
grumbled taking the sack and keys
from the young mans hand

  moore muttered something about
stopped to get a drink of water and
taking his seat at the desk resumed his
operations on the adding machine

  soon the hands on the great clock
touched twelve and the official-banking
day was over the last few stragglers
were served mr haskell hung out
the tin sign bearing the word closed
before his window and began to count
his cash moore worked steadily away
on the machine the other tellers their
currency counted turned out the lights
in their cages and carried their trays
of money down to their compartments
in the vault one by one the clerks
and bookkeepers through with the
days work left the building

  presently mr haskell stepped back
and looked down the line of darkened
cages all gone eh great scott this
was a beastly day im glad to-
morrows sunday about through
moore

  just finished answered the assist-
ant clearing the machine

  good help me carry this stuff
down to the vault ive got to hurry
got an engagement for two oclock

  moore picked up several sacks of
money and waited while mr haskell
turned out the light in the cage they
passed out into the deserted banking
room

  all right mr wade said mr

haskell as they passed the cashiers
desk

  the three of them-moore first with
the bags of money then haskell carry-
ing the tray of bills last the cashier-
descended to the vault room

 the trying moment had  come
moore hardly breathed with suppressed
excitement haskell thrust the key into
the lock of his compartment and threw
open the door he placed his tray upon
a shelf then turned and took the sacks
from moore these he put beside the
tray he stepped back shut the door
and locked it as they passed out of
the vault moore drew a long breath
and wiped the sweat from his face

  the cashier was setting the time
locks forty-three and one-half hours
mr haskell he said working on the
dials

  right

  the watchman swung the ponderous
door into place the cashier laid hold
on the wheel and turned it there was
a clicking of bolts a falling of levers
into place and moore knew that until
half past eight monday morning his
secret was safe

  he wished the others good night
in a strange unnatural voice his lips
were so dry that they cracked as he
parted them to speak he went up-
stairs to the lockers put on his hat and
coat and five minutes later was on the
street

  as he passed down the crowded
sidewalk he was conscious of a curi-
ous sense of elation which mingled
strangely with the hateful torture of
his thoughts did he not have pressed
warm and close against his body what
all this hurrying throng was striving
for money-money truly it was
money made the world go round he
had it-it was his-a fortune-thou-
sands of dollars power was his
freedom was his could he keep them 
he smiled grimly at the thought

  his plan began to shape itself in his


detective story magazine

mind he would take a train to phila-
delphia in order to baffle pursuit and
at once embark for south america by
midnight he would be miles out on the
atlantic with forty hours start he
should be able to elude the hue and cry
he stepped into a cigar store and tele-
phoned the railroad ticket office a
train left for philadelphia at four
oclock he had no time to lose

  he boarded a street car and in
twenty minutes dismounted at his cor-
ner he walked halfway up the block
ran quickly up a flight of stone steps to
the door and thrust his key into the
lock as he opened the door he was
met by the dank musty smell peculiar
to boarding houses of the second class

  he glanced down the empty hall
then softly closing the door he tip-
toed to the stairway and cautiously as-
cended to the second floor

  safely in his own room he locked
the door and taking a cigarette box
from his pocket placed the last ciga-
rette it held between his lips and threw
the empty box into a corner

  for a moment he stood puffing rap-
idly his face pale and nervously twitch-
ing his hand trembling as he took the
cigarette from his feverish lips at
last he unbuttoned his shirt and took
the money package by package from
its hiding place throwing it upon a
small center table

  when he had taken it all out he
sank down upon a chair and stared at it

  and so it was for this-this handful
of faded and dirty bills-that he had
bartered his honor his peace of mind
his quietude of soul for this he had
become an outcast a wanderer upon
the face of the earth who for all this
wealth would give him back the right
to walk with honest men how now
could he look upon the world and say
that it was good all was black and
murky discolored by the guilt upon his
soul he laughed aloud discordantly

and rocked his body to and fro in an
agony of vain remorse

  if only the boy had stayed away one
little moment longer if only one of
the other clerks had been sent for the

gold if only- cursed cursed fate

that had conspired to undo him

  once he thought of taking the money
back and confessing xo that was im-
possible the irrevocableness of his act
sickened him how could he erase
from mens minds the knowledge of his
guilt  would they not rather pity him
as a weak fool too cowardly to carry
out the thievery he had devised

  and the others-clerks bookkeepers
tellers mr haskell honest men all
poor hard-working struggling along on
meager salaries heads of families all-
all-upon all would fall the shadow of
his guilt mistrust would light upon
all

  once before a clerk had stolen and
had been detected it took six months
to dissipate the vague suspicion which
hovered over the bank

  philip jerked upright in his seat and
seized a pad of paper which lay upon
the table he would do what he could
in reparation so far as lay within his
power he would make amends hav-
ing no pen and ink he took a lead pen-
cil from his pocket and wrote

  mr haskell  this letter will not be de-
livered to you before nine oclock monday
morning and by that time i will be out of
reach god help me i cannot tell why i
have done what i have done it was a mo-
ment of madness already i repent and am
miserable i write you this not in a spirit
of bravado but merely so that no innocent
party shall suffer i have no accomplices
-no one else is guilty-i am alone i hope
that no one else will be implicated i as-
sume all responsibility thank you for past
kindnesses	philip moore

  he put the note in an envelope which
he addressed to haskell care city
bank

  he sealed the letter feeling a warm
glow of charity and good will run
the letter in the mail



through him at the act of justice he
had done at least he would bear the
consequences of his wrongdoing he
felt almost heroic his crime had been
dignified with returning ease of mind
came thoughts of escape he dragged
a battered suit case from beneath the
bed into this he packed the money
then filled the case with clothes from
his trunk

  this done he searched his pockets
for a cigarette then remembered that
he had used the last one he glanced
at his watch it was two oclock to
idle away an hour or more without the
solace of tobacco was impossible he
arose from his chair and picking up
the letter left the room locking the
door after him

  he dropped the letter into the mail
box on the corner then as the lid fell
with a clang thought that he might just
as well have waited until later how-
ever it did not matter-the banks mail
was not delivered until monday morn-
ing he purchased four packages of
cigarettes from the corner druggist nd
returned to his room all was as he
had left it

  he busied himself going through his
trunk seeing if there was anything else
he cared to take and burned a few let-
ters he moved about leisurely taking
a mental farewell of the cheap little
room and its contents he took a five-
dollar bill from his pocket and put it
on the dresser for the landlady then
remembered that he would need money
for his railroad and steamship tickets
it would not do to be always unpacking
his bag

  undoing the fastenings of the suit
case and reaching under the clothing
he drew out a bundle of bills he
slipped ten or twelve bills from beneath
the bands and then-with mouth agape
and starting eyeballs-stood looking at
what he held he dropped the pack-
age and in an ecstasy of madness tore
open the other bundles all were the

same they were dummies some one
had been before him the top and the
bottom bill of each package were genu-
ine-all between were worthless

  he sank down upon the bed and for
a long time he sat staring straight be-
fore him his mind a wild jumble of
unmanageable thoughts what did it
mean who had done it what was
he to do with this secret he had stum-
bled on  flight was impossible now
that he had practically no money
should he go back to the bank on mon-
day morning and resume his duties as
usual and then there flashed across
his mind the remembrance of the letter
he had posted

  with the thought he leaped to his
feet in an agony of fear he had con-
victed himself of a crime of which
though guilty in intention he was al-
most guiltless of execution the room
swirled around him and he was near
to fainting and then out of his mad-
ness came the way of escape he
would go to mr haskell confess all
and throw himself upon the tellers
mercy no other course was possible
there was nothing else to do

  in feverish haste he crammed the
bundles into the suit case locked it and
thrust it beneath the bed he left the
roonvlocking the door after him and
almost ran to the corner drug store

  moore was so nervous that he could
hardly find the number in the telephone
directory of the hotel where mr has-
kell lived it seemed an age before
the operator gave him the connection
he was told by the clerk that mr has-
kell was not in his room

  he remembered that the teller had
spoken of an engagement for the after-
noon he left the drug store and wan-
dered up arid down the street in a
half hour he tried again with the same
result he kept on telephoning every
half hour but it was almost eight
oclock when he got mr haskell on the
wire


detective story magazine

  hello mr haskell this is moore
i must see you at once-but it is most
important its about the bank i will
come to your rooms-all right ill be
there in twenty minutes

  hanging up the receiver he wiped
the sweat from his forehead a clerk
was watching him curiously but he
paid no attention to him and hastily
left the store

  he boarded a street car and stood
on the rear platform trying to think
how he should word what he had to
say mr haskell was a bachelor with
apartments at the buckingham hotel
he had told philip over the telephone
that he had an engagement for the
evening and the young man was in a
turmoil of anxiety lest the teller leavfe
his rooms before he could get to him

  at last he reached the hotel and was
shown to mr haskells rooms by a bell
boy he knocked upon the door with
a hand that shook until his knuckles
rattled against the panel

  at the word to enter he opened the
door and stepped into the room he
was in a magnificently furnished li-
brary or study lined with books and
pictures the furniture was heavy and
luxurious in the center of the room
stood a massive table on which was an
electrolier whose colored globe threw
the recesses of the room into shadow
just beyond the table stood mr has-
kell in evening dress a lighted match
held to the cigar between his lips
philip closed the door and crossed the
room

 hello moore what the deuce
brings you here at this time of night
youll have to make your visit short
im just going out

  philip placed his hat upon the table
and coming around stood before his
superior pm sorry mr haskell but
im afraid that what i have to tell you
will spoil your evenings pleasure its
about the bank

  well go on

  mr haskell ive been a clerk at the
third national five years ive always
been honest but lately something has
been the matter with me at first i
had great hopes for the future but
advancement was slowr-very slow i
didnt seem to attract much attention
i began to get discontented and my life
seemed gray and monotonous then
there was the money-money every-
where when a man gets to feeling
like i did he must watch himself all
the time when there is money around

  i cant tell you how i came to do
it ive beefi afraid of it for a long
time several times i was on the point
of giving up my position because i
couldnt trust myself i lost my head
to-day and did it

  did what asked haskell in a
harsh voice

  stole i had been thinking about it
for six months-thinking that i would
until i came to believe that i must i
tried to put the thought away from me
but i couldnt the harder i tried to
get it out of my mind the more i
thought of it by trying to reason
myself into being an honest man i
badgered myself into being a thief
im sick-thats what i am-brain
sick

  heres the deuce to pay  ejaculated
haskell pushing forward a couple of
chairs sit down why do you tell
me this  how much have you taken 

  next to nothing replied philip sit-
ting down on the edge of the chair
and boring one hand nervously into the
other you remember when you sent
me down for that bag of gold this
morning

  yes go ahead

  while i was in the vault i took
seven bundles of bills from your com-
partment and put them inside my
shirt

  good heavens haskell leaned
forward in his seat the blood rushing
up his face in waves his eyes blazing
the letter in the mail



from where did you take this
money 

  from your reserve currency on the
top shelf answered philip watching
the other in amazement

  haskell leaped to his feet and paced
the room cursing under his breath
puffing furiously at his cigar philip
watched him-astonished at the others
passion

  well go ahead burst out haskell
after a turn or two dont sit there
like a graven image what next  did
virtue triumph in the end

  no sir im sorry to say it didnt
i went home fully resolved to take a
steamer to-night and leave the country
when i got home i happened to open
one of the bundles then i opened them
all mr haskell some one has been
tampering with your reserve funds i
had seven bundles of old confederate
bills only the top and bottom bills
were genuine

  haskell took out his handkerchief
and wiped his face good heavens
moore this is dreadful wrhom do
you suspect

  mr haskell you dont know how
glad i am to hear you say that you
believe what i am telling you asked
philip eagerly

  of course i believe you if you
were not speaking the truth you
wouldnt be here why should i not
believe you

  philip drew a long breath thanks
for your confidence it makes the rest
easy i am sure you will help me
why-what do you mean 

  before i discovered that the pack-
ages were dummies i mailed a letter to
you confessing to the robbery and free-
ing any one else of suspicion

  you-you did what

  mailed you a confession i didnt
want any one else to bear the blame
the letter will be delivered to you
monday morning i came here to-night

to ask you to give it back to me-un-
opened

  the letter is in the mails now 
  yes sir

  for fully a minute haskell stood be-
fore philip staring into his face then
he turned away put his cigar into his
mouth and finding that it had burned
out lighted a fresh one he walked up
and down the room a few times finally
he came up to philip and in slow even
words said moore i am the man
who tampered with the reserves
you cried philip staggering
back

  yes i do you think that no one
ever steals except a professional thug
and a half-starved forty-dollar-a-month
clerk  ive lost money in speculation-
all i had then i tried to get it back
-with other peoples money-like the
fool i am i fixed up the dummy pack-
ages and stole from the reserve funds
i lost again and stole more ive lived
in a hell for the past three months
every time a teller asked me for money
i thought i was discovered every
time a bank examiner entered the door
i broke into a cold sweat at every
meeting of the directors i had to half
fill myself with whisky to brace myself
for the shock i thought was coming
ive been walking the plank and ex-
pected every moment to come to the
end heavens its awful awful i
tell you the words rushed from his
lips in a torrent tripping over each
other he paced the room carried
away with excitement

  philip stared at him speechless
haskell came quickly toward him
talking rapidly but thats all over
now moore well fix it-fix it so that
we both get what we want you-
money me-peace

  they stood close together staring
each into the others pale face dont
you see breathed haskell ill give
you a thousand dollars to-night you
can catch a steamer in an hour mon-

lars to paris ill take the money from

absence-lull suspicion-delay investi-
gation when you are safely out of
reach ill bring out your confession
then well laugh at them moore-you
in paris-i here-safe-in peace he
sank down into a chair and covered
his face with his hands his body shaken
by a paroxysm of hysterical sobs

  philip watched the bowed figure

striving to comprehend at last--

ill not do it he burst out passion-
ately ill not do it

  haskell lowered his hands and looked
blankly up not do it then spring-
ing to his feet why you fool
werent you going to steal the money 
yes but i didnt get away with it
and im glad of it do you think i
want to change places with you did
the money make you happy look at
what you are now-a wreck a liar a
thief and a coward-yes a coward
you want to shift the responsibility for
what you have done to another bah
im a hundred times better man than
you are i accepted the consequences
of my wrong i even wrote a letter pro-
claiming myself the thief i didnt
shirk i was willing to pay for what
i had done

  curse your heroics will you do
as i say

  no-once and for all-no

  haskell looked steadily at him for a
moment then going to the door he
locked it and put the key into his
pocket coming back to the table he
pulled open a drawer and took out a
revolver by heaven you will
though he said with a snarl youll
take the money and leave town to-
night or else to-morrow morning youll
be in jail

  what do you mean stammered
philip starting back

  simply that ill have you arrested
for stealing from the bank have you
forgotten the confession you mailed
me 

  you wouldnt use that against me
cried philip wildly why ill tell the
truth ill tell them what you have
told me to-night

  that for what youll tell them
jeered haskell snapping his fingers
do you think theyll listen to you 
what is your word against mine
backed up by your written confession
ill send you to the penitentiary for ten
years

  let me out of here panted philip
losing all self-control let me out of
here ill go to the postal authorities
ill beg them to give me back the letter
you shant have it

  i will have it said haskell coldly
now sit down and dont make a fool
of yourself will you leave the city if
i give you the money

  no-a thousand times

  all right-now listen to me pm
going to keep you here all night i
have a lock box at the post office in
which all my personal mail even if it
is addressed to me in care of the bank
is placed i rented it to receive my
numerous communications from bucket
shops and stockbrokers it would never
do to have such mail coming to the
bank i had no idea it would serve
me such a good turn as it has to-day
early to-morrow morning i will send
a bell boy down for the mail when
your confession is in my hands ill give
you one last chance to decide if you
refuse my offer ill have you arrested
and accuse you of the theft as certain
as that my name is wilbur haskell
now thats all there is no use argu-
ing about this thing go into my bed-
room if you like and lie down ill
sit up and watch if you prefer to keep
me company all right

  he took off his dress coat and put-
ting on a lounging robe which lay on
the letter in the mail



a chair he dropped the revolver into
the capacious pocket of the gown he
brought cigars cigarettes and a decan-
ter of brandy from a cellarette and
placed them upon the table sit down
moore we might as well be com-
fortable we have a long wait before
us he drew a chair to the table and
poured out liquor for them both

  philip sank down into a seat his face
white and agonized mr haskell-
please-please dont make me do this
thing look at me im not a thief
think of the temptation think of the
gray sameness of my life give me
another chance

  haskell slowly placed his glass upon
the table whats the use moore
you would do it again you talk about
the sameness of your life what about
mine you couldnt stand it for five
years ive been up against it for
twenty i tell you it would get you
again-a man cant fight it down for-
ever now whats the use of sitting
there hugging up to your misery like a
sick kitten to a hot brick here are
your friends my boy-make the most
of them he tapped his fingers on the
decanter then rattled the loose silver in
his pocket his manner and speech
chilled philip to the heart

  the hours dragged wearily into the
past few noises came up from the
street passing footsteps ceased to echo
in the corridor in the brooding
silence the two men sat philip rousing
himself now and then to make a plea
for mercy plunging back again into a
sea of trouble at the cold heartless
reply to his appeal struggling vainly in
the net which enmeshed him haskell
sure of his power watched his victim
now sneering now snarling now
amused now half angry then would
come a long term of silence broken only
by the scratching of a match or the
tinkle of a glass

  the east began to redden presently
a beam of sunlight flashed into the

room and put the electric light to
shame haskell pushed back his chair
and arose at last the day is herel
he went to the window and raising it
a little stood drawing the crisp air into
his lungs with thrown-out chest

  philip watched him his face gray
and drawn from the long strain mr
haskell he asked do you still intend
to do as you said you would

  haskell closed the window and com-
ing to the table turned out the electro-
lier i most assuredly do have you
made up your mind 

  philip did not answer and after a
moments silence haskell pressed a call
for a bell boy he came back to the
table and removed the decanter and
glasses whistling softly

  at a knock on the door he took the
key from his pocket and opened the
door a little way oh its you is it
peter i want you to bring me up
some coffee and some sandwiches-any
kind will do bring two cups and sau-
cers and come back here yourself

  in a few moments the boy returned
with a coffee percolator and some sand-
wiches upon a tray haskell opened
the door for him and he brought the
things forward to the table

  now peter said haskell standing
before the boy with his hands in his
pockets and a smile on his lips i
want you to do something for me here
is some money and a key take a taxi-
cab and go down to the post office
the key is for lock box no  open
the box and bring the mail here you
may keep the change hurry now
when the boy had left the room
haskell started toward the door as if
to lock it then turned around with a
laugh no need to keep you under
lock and key eh moore i guess you
are just as anxious to stay as i am to
have you he went to the percolator
and drew two cups of coffee theres
something will make things look
brighter moore help yourself to


detective story magazine

sugar and cream he took up a sand-
wich and began to eat

  mr haskell said philip with dry
lips pushing aside the cup this is a
dreadful thing you are about to do do
you realize that either way you are
ruining my life

  oh come now im only obeying
the first law of nature you dont sup-
pose i am anxious to change all this
-waving his hand-for a striped suit
and a four-by-eight cell you wouldnt
either i wish you would take my
advice and my-or rather the banks-
money and make tracks for europe
youve helped me out of a mess and i
appreciate it im not a bad sort im
mighty sorry for you but as long as
it must be one of us why naturally
id rather it would be you than me
but why me  asked philip bitterly
why dpnt you play the man and pay
for it yourself i havent done you
any wrong

  well console yourself with the
thought that it is often the innocent
who suffer im not going to argue my
actions on moral grounds im satisfied
with results as they are he lighted
a cigarette and sipped his coffee

  philip arose and began to pace the
floor - as he neared the door he heard
a step in the corridor then a knock
instantly he called out is that you
peter

  yes sir

  how many letters have you 
  three sir

  one addressed in pencil-the stamp
upside down

  yes sir

  remember that letter

  he turned around and faced has-
kell the teller was on his feet his
revolver leveled at philip

  get away from that door haskell
snarled under his breath

  philips face was white and the hand
of death seemed on his heart he did
not move

  get away from that door or ill
kill you

  you wouldnt dare theyd know
the letter wasnt in your hands

  haskells face was fearfully dis-
torted his eyes seemed starting from
his head he had the appearance of a
man completely unnerved the crisis
had taken him off his guard

  philip backed slowly toward the
door keeping his eyes fixed on the
spasmodically working face of haskell
it was horrible-the sight of this man
trying to work himself up to the point
of killing another man

  you dont dare shoot philip
spoke in a whisper forcing the thought
rather than the words across the space
which separated them you dont
dare youre a coward-thats what
youare youre afraid of blood-red
blood youre a coward-a coward
his hand slid along the door and found
the knob

  you havent got the nerve to shoot
its an awful thing to kill a man you
see the death watch-the little door-
the chair he turned the doorknob
slowly and then youre a coward-
dont forget-a coward he waited

  my god youre right i cant
the cry was wrung from haskells
agonized lips i cant-i cant he
turnfed suddenly and rushed toward the
bedroom stumbled blindly cursing in-
coherently the revolver clutched tightly
in his hand

  philip jerked open the door and
seizing the startled bell boy pulled him
into the room get the police-quick
something-something dreadful will
happen

  he grasped the letters from the boys
hand then pushed him toward the door

  suddenly a shot rang out from the
inner room followed by a groan and
the crash of a heavy fall then silence
philip stared into the blanched face of
the boy a wreath of blue smoke
floated through the bedroom doorway

   two gentlemen crooks successfully carried out a robbery of big propor-
tions and for several months continued to live in the neighborhood of the scene
of their job without apparently arousing the slightest suspicion one of the
crooks jim had a close friend dugan with whom he spent a good part of his
spare time one night when jim was dining with dugan at the mammoth restau-
rant in one of our largest cities a page brought him a small white envelope
excusing himself he proceeded to examine the contents a moment later he
glared wild-eyed at dugan muttered a brusque apology for a hasty departure
and bolted from the room dugan sprang forward to intercept him but was
too late in his haste jim dropped the message he had just received upon
examining it dugan found it to be a cipher message which when translated
proved to be cause enough for a crooks hasty departure from that immediate
locality what was in the note

the snitch



in a door at its end quong wong a
fence for crooks and keeper of an
opium den listened until a signal for
entrance had been repeated with unmis-
takable distinction only until then
did the oriental approach near the door
and open it slightly to scrutinize the
features of his nocturnal visitor

  its me quong a voice whispered
jimmy dolan-dont you know me 

  the oriental continued to stare he
knew the face only too well but if he
recognized the man he gave no indica-
tion

  come on quong let me in you
know me i come your place all the
time-long time ago-you remember-
got arrested here-sent to san quentin
remember 

  after a moment the oriental asked
you in trouble

  no-no trouble quong why you
ask

  the oriental did not answer he
drew back and allowed the white man
to enter the visitor strode down the
passageway with a quick nervous step
at the other end he admitted himself to
a dimly lighted room where a row of
bunks on each side gave it the unmistak-
able identity of an opium den the
oriental followed quickly behind him

  wheres the gang quong asked
the man

  all gone was the reply then
after a pause police-a-man come
raid slim him get catched the kid
too

  the name kid smote upon the
white man and if the oriental had
noticed he would have seen his eyes
narrow

  whatd they get the kid for

  police-a-man say break safe

  he lies-some one snitched and
the white mans attitude for the mo-
ment was menacing quickly he recov-
ered himself

  who stooled he persisted and his

eyes bored through the oriental until
the slant-eyed heathen had to shift his
gaze

  no understand the oriental has
fortified himself behind two english
words which furnish an impenetrable
barrier for further questioning when
the wily yellow race chooses to evade
cross-examination

  the white man shifted on his feet
come on quong get the layout i
havent had a smoke in ages quit a
five-year sentence this morning cut to
three and a half

  the oriental went to a closet arid re-
turned with a large tray and a thick
pipe the white man took off his coat
and prepared to smoke the oriental
watched the mans every move-all but
one had his eyes remained on the
white man he would have seen a quick
substitution of the opium to a harm-
less hard substance with the same pun-
gent smell as the deadly drug that went
into the pipe instead the white man
stretched himself on a lower bunk and
drawing deeply on the pipe dropped off
into the apparent lethargy that the juice
of the poppy brings to its slaves

  satisfying himself that his visitor had
gone to the land of dreams the ori-
ental stole quietly from the room if
he had turned he would have caught
the white mans eyes following his
movements half an hour elapsed
the white man never moved then
the oriental came back into the room
a figure followed him closely but
neither spoke

  him same dead the oriental said
after a silence before which the new-
comer had gone to the side of the sleep-
ing man and raised an eyelid him
no smoke four years--sleep much now
the chinaman continued

  all right quong the man spoke
for the first time keep an eye on that
bird and let me know every time he
comes here we dont want him now
but you can never tell lies only out

a day give him time hell go hack
to a moral certainty thanks to you
quong his pal has a home in folsom
for a bit thatll keep him out of mischief
for fifteen years clever job ouong
without the tip wed neverve got him
this bird ought to be at folsom with
him quong-and the man started
toward the door-youve sent more
crooks to the pen than the whole de-
partment might drop in later when
this bird comes to want to break the
news that the kid has gone on a long
journey glancing back in the direc-
tion of the man who lay sleeping he
passed through the door

  an hour later detective jos goss of
the san francisco chinatown squad
rapped a signal on a door of a house
in wakeley alley there was no re-
sponse then he tried the door and
found it open groping his way along
a passageway he stumbled over a body
stooping he took an electric flash light
from his pocket and the first thing its

bright rays disclosed was a pool of
blood then the still white face of
quong wong

  the detective didnt stop to notify
the morgue-there was more important
business at hand in twenty minutes a
police net had been spread throughout
the city for jimmy dolan ex-convict
and until that same morning known
as convict no 

  it was almost dawn when goss was
summoned to the city hospital at the
door of the accident ward he was met
by a plain-clothes man

  we got him goss but he put up an
awful fight the doc says hes done
for-lightll go out any minute now
stepping over to the bedside of the
wounded man goss bent over him
dolan opened his eyes when the detec-
tive spoke to him

  youre going to die bo why did
you do it

  i should worry the dying man
gasped for i got that dirty yellow
