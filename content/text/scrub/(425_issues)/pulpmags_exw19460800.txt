a department for readers conducted by captain ranger

the hombre who knows something
about trapping fur-bearers or the fel-
low who craves to leam can find a wide
scatterment of trapping opportunity in the
west he can take his wife along to live
with him in the wilderness if shes the out-
door type of girl a lot of modem trappers
do but hitched or single the trapper ought
to be in for some good seasons for several
perhaps many years to come

  the war did it its effect on trapping was
definite and far-reaching during the time
we were engrossed with the big job of put-
ting the squash on hitler and hirohito trap-
pers too did their bit they came out of the
woods down from the mountains and in from
the fork of the creeks

  leaving their cabin homes snug and locked
against the day of their return they joined
the armed forces or went to the cities and
engaged in essential war work patriotism
thinned the ranks of these outdoor men just
how much is a story that hasnt fully been
told but it is estimated that at least in one
western trapping section perhaps close to
 percent of the professional trappers left
their traplines untended during the war

an increase in wild life

  as a result wildlife has increased tremen-
dously during the past few years true of
the valuable fur-bearers this is equally
true of the crafty predatory creatures ani-
mals such as wolves and coyotes region-
ally the increase has been widespread it
has been noted in the far north in alaska
and in the eastern trapping states as well
as in the west

  large and small animals alike have been
staging a numerical comeback due to the
dearth of trappers and hunters in the field
during the war

  for example last year there was a regular
bull market in bears up around patten
maine some  of the big bruins were killed
one man shot  and another near east-
brook shot  in one day

 michigan too had a bear boom so much
so that the state has declared a year-round
open season on bears in about a score of
counties

  in the small animal department last year
saw new yorks first open season on otter
in ten years trappers under conservation
authority regulations were limited to 
pelts and not all the state was thrown open
but its a start additional evidence of the
definite increase of fur-bearers and last year
the fox take in new york was according
to preliminary estimates destined to be
greater than at any time in history-an esti-
mated  or more

the wily fox

  because of the states unprecedently high
fox population the n y s conservation de-
partment last year utilized professional trap-
pers to help catch the over-awundant foxes
and enlarged its schedule of trapping dem-
onstrations given to teach trappers and oth-
ers how best to trap the wily animal

 in addition expert trappers were made
available by the department to help out in
local cases where poultrymen and farmers
were suffering heavily from fox damage
there was talk of establishing a fox bounty
in some sections

  out west the same thing has been happen-
ing on a similar scale take texas for in-
stance stock owners there have been bom-
barding commission officials with complaints
that coyotes are causing extensive damage
in south texas and up along the canadian
river in the panhandle

chapter i

a shot on the trail

tombstone jones and speedy
smith were very miserable someone
in lazy moon valley had told tomb-
stone of a short cut out of the valley and
tombstone was always in favor of the
shortest distance between two points that is
all right if you have a destination in mind-
which tombstone didnt have

  just now they were coming down a can-
yon facing a bitter wind in which there was
a hint of snow-or at least cold rain they
wore yellow slickers which flapped in the
wind speedys had only one button and that
at the collar which caused him untold
misery as the slicker billowed out like a sail
in the wind and threatened to blow him off
the saddle any time he shifted his position

  speedy was five feet seven inches tall
shaped like a reed and was about the same
weight tombstone jones was built exactly

a tombstone and speedy novelet
	exciting

like speedy except that in his high-heels and
sombrero he was seven feet tall these two
had finished up a job for the cattlemens as-
sociation and were evidently trying to get a
birds-eye view of the country

 you and yore short-cuts groaned
speedy dismally here we are on top of
the world a-headin for the north pole
didnt the man say where this here alleged
cut-off would take us

  he jist said it was a short way out of the
valley replied tombstone i plumb forgot
to ask him where itd take us

  naturally but if we cant talk eskimo

tombstone jones

we better go back i tell yuh im froze to the
bone nothin in sight down yonder except
pine trees high rocks and rain cornin down
the divide

  tombstone drew his slicker closer arouftd
his skinny neck and then tried to beat his
arms around his body which caused his horse
almost to leave the hill-and tombstone
jones

  at least he panted when he got the
animal back on the trail it warmed me up
im good for miles nqw

  in lessn an hour itll be dark said
speedy ill betcha some explorer will come
through here in seven eight years and find
two grizzly skillingtons on the trail thatll be
me and you tombstone hell mark the spot
and-

  whats skillington asked tombstone

  thats a man with his insides out and his
outsides off

western

  why queried tombstone would a ex-
plorer come through here

  short cut replied speedy maliciously
theyre all crazy too

  after all said tombstone were detec-
tives we cant get lost

  that said speedy wearily is a state-
ment that aint shared none by jim keaton
jim keaton snorted tombstone yuh
know speedy the more i work for that peli-
cano the less i think    oh-oh cows
cornin up the trail we aint lost as long
as theres cows-

                    

a rider spurring past the advancing
herd half-buried in the brush jerked
up his stumbling horse tombstone threw
up one hand in a trail greeting and a mo-
ment later the man had drawn a gun and
shot at them speedys horse flung down
its head started backward in a lunging rear
and went down flat on the trail while speedy
fell into the brush

  the man had whirled his horse and was
going back as fast as his horse could travel
in the heavy brush and rocks tombstone
lifted in his stirrups and sent three shots
after the man the canyon echoing from the
bombardment

  are yuh all right speedy asked tomb-
stone anxiously

  no i aint all right fm sores a boil my
horse is dead

  t figured he wasnt doin that act for fun
said tombstone cut yore saddle loose-no
use losin that too

  ive done got the cinch loose panted
speedy what do yuh reckon made that
feller shoot

  his brains probly frost-bitten

  yeah grunted speedy probly went
back to get a warm one here hang onto
that saddle until i can git up behind yuh
the cattle had stopped some drifting down
into the canyon while others humped their
way further up the slope speedy crawled
up behind tombstone who handed the saddle
back to him it is none too comfortable
riding double and carrying a forty-pound
saddle

   wish i knowed what to do said tomb-
stone apprehensively

  yore a detective reminded speedy
anyway do somethin this blasted hull
weighs a ton

  if we go on down the trail well meet that
sudden jasper speedy

  hit for the top of the hill mebbe we can
make it

  they did from there they could not see
the short cut	

into the canyon and the brush wasnt too
bad they went carefully along for a mile or
so but did not see anybody finally they
came to a hogback which led down into sort
of a small valley and here they found their
trail again

  it was growing dark and there was a spit
of rain in the air

  we better find some place to hole up or
this broomtail were ridin will have per-
mnent bow-legs said speedy i wish this
here saddle of mine had wheels on it we
could haul it behind

  this here country dont look inhabited
noways sighed tombstone

  at that moment they heard a locomotive
whistle far down ahead of them

 sounds good said tombstone must
be people where theres a train

  probly some people in it said speedy
goin through here as fast as possible

  a mile further on they broke out into the
open it was raining now but ahead of them
was a small railroad station and a water-
tank perched beside the tracks they could
see the tracks leading away on one side the
heavy grade visible to even an unpracticed
eye

  water was dripping off the eaves of the
depot as they dismounted and walked around
the narrow platform it was so nearly dark
too that the depot agent in this far-away spot
had already lighted an oil lamp on his coun-
ter there was no passenger room

  the agent a slight hatchet-faced flea-
bitten sort of a person came to the doorway
an old corn-cob pipe clenched between his
teeth

 howdy tombstone grinned mind if
we come in out of the wet

  well i aint runnin no hotel

  thank yuh kindly interrupted tomb-
stone and came in with speedy at his heels

  it was warm in there and dry they took
off their old slickers

  the agent surveyed them grimly

  just takin over the place eh he said
coldly

  speedy placed the slickers in a pile on the
floor and turned to the agent

  its night and its rainin he said slowly
i hope you aint one of them fellers who
think that hospitality means goin to a hos-
pital

  i aint allowed to have nobody in here
he said

  thats all right-youve done yore part
said tombstone nobody aint goin to blame
yuh for not throwin us out how about
somethin to eat

the agent backed against his counter
and eyed them grimly

wait a minute he said you two bust
in here not bein wanted at all and youve
got the gall to want me to feed you

thats right speedy grinned simple
as that say can yuh send a telegram for
us

 the agent relaxed yes i can send a tele-
 gram-if you pay for it

you can take it collect said speedy
where-at is a pencil

tombstone couldnt read nor write but
speedy had an education of sorts so speedy

speedy smith

 wrote the telegram to jim keaton secretary
 of the cattlemens association it read

where do we go next and is a dead horse
legitimate expenses how about liniment
wire quick or we may be gone

speedy signed tombstones name the
agent sat down at his desk eying the tele-
gram which he proceeded to send the two
cowpokes watched him

i never could read that kinda stuff
tombstone said dontcha know it

 i suspected it said speedy dryly the
 agent filed the wire

 so you boys work for the cattle associa-
 tion eh he remarked

tophands bragged tombstone actu-
ally we run it jim keaton is jist sort of a
office boy for me and speedy

 thats nice said the agent howd your
exciting western



horse get killed

  oh said tombstone some half-witted
cowpoke took a shot at us back yonder and
killed the horse

  thats interestin said the agent thought-
fully no reason for shootin at yuh eh
he probly did have said speedy yuh
cant tell anyway he didnt stop to tell us
his reasons how about somethin to eat im
hongry

  the agent took them up to his living quar-
ters over the depot where a pot of stew was
warm on the stove he did his own cooking

  there was a double bed in the place the
agent set out some dishes and put the stew
on the table he said he wasnt very hungry
and he had to be downstairs until after cer-
tain trains went through

 the two hungry cowpokes made short
work of the stew while the wind whistled
around the eaves and the rain washed down
the windows

  that there bed shore looks awful invitin
sighed sleepy but it aint noways big
enough for three growed-up men
tombstone yawned and nodded they
smoked and eyed the bed until the agent
came up

  you boys better hop into bed and get a
good sleep he said ill be down at the in-
strument most all night i reckon theres
a pretty big storm in the hills tonight and
ill have to watch things go right to bed and
dont worry about me see yuh later

  the agent went back down the stairs
speedy didnt waste any time in getting un-
dressed tombstone was thoughtful as he
pulled off his boots

  well shuck yore duds and hit the hay
said sleepy

  shore shore replied tombstone huh
what made that feller git so danged nice all
at once growled like a badger at first
huh

  never look a gift horse in the mouth
said speedy man is this a soft bed i
could sleep for a week

  all yuh think about is personal comfort
said tombstone me ive got to do the brain
work for two brains i was just sayin that
this here station agent seemed too polite like
a tinhorn tryin to bait a greenhorn into a
sky-limit poker game

  how would yuh know speedy yawned
ive been baited into them games tomb-
stone replied starting to undress i tell yuh
that i dont like the looks of this im just
curious enough to sit up the rest of the night
but if nothin happened then yuhd be laugh-
in at me all day tomorrer

chapter h

no holdup

ombstone went to bed
but with misgivings he
was tired but disturbed
in the mind that man
downstairs had gone out
of character too quickly

  then tombstone got
out of bed went over to
the door to the stairway
and listened but there
was another door at the
bottom and this was
closed all he could hear
was the staccato clatter of the telegraph
sounder occasionally so he went back to bed

  it was warm up there and the bed was soft
so tombstone forgot his fears in slumber
suddenly he was awake he listened closely
there was little wind now but a steady drip
from the eaves then he heard muffled voices
he slid out of bed and felt his way to a front
window it opened noiselessly and he
crouched on the floor listening the voices
were low but he could hear them

  i dont like it-cow detectives too a
man said

  i tell you theyre in bed and asleep i
couldnt get rid of em just a couple of
dumb cowpokes been asleep for over an
hour

  its all right said a deep voice well
cut that train and be out of here before any-
body knows it well tie andy up now its
almost time to get busy cmon andy

  tombstone scratched his head and studied
what he had heard they were going to tie
andy up and cut the train why that had
all the earmarks of a train robbery and
what a place to pull it miles away from any
other place nobody there except the depot
agent maybe cut the wires

  tombstone felt his way back to the bed put
his hand over sleepys mouth and yanked his
ear it was effective sleepy sat up like a
jack-in-the-box but never made a sound

  theyre goin to hold up the train tomb-
stone whispered do yuh understand

  leggo m ear holdup eh waitll i get
m -

  come over by the window and listen

  they managed to get back to the window
as the two men came outside there was
some sort of a projection from the front of the
depot and on it hung a red lantern burning
brightly from far down the canyon came
the wail of a locomotive whistle

	exciting

    shes on time one of the men said
  cmon i know where that engine will stop
  ive spotted it twice

they went swiftly away in the darkness
didja ever see such hair on a dawg
speedy said theyre goin to stick up the
engine crew cut off the baggage and ex-
press car and head for the top of the hill
thats the idea i reckon said tombstone
from far down the canyon they saw the
sweep of light as the engine swung around
a turn and again they heard the wail of that
whistle

    yore duty speedy is to go down and
  take away that red light tombstone said
  my duty why you long-legged-

    its got to be done speedy

    no by me mebbe one of them jaspers is
  lookin out for just that kind of a move and
  id get m earthly envelope punctured you
  do it-yore tallern i am

   listen exclaimed tombstone one
  more turn and that danged train will be in
  sight and then its too blamed late

    never too late said speedy watch
  me

j speedy had brought his colt forty-five over
  to the window now he rested the gun
  against the side of the window took quick
  aim and squeezed the trigger the windows
  rattled from the explosion but the red light
  went out in a shower of broken glass

    a few moments later the headlight of the
  locomotive bathed the depot in light and the
  heavy train came grinding in past the little
  depot hardly a light showing from the
  coaches they watched it until the tail-
  lights disappeared around another curve

    suddenly there was a pencil-like flash of
  light from up the track and a bullet smashed
  into the side of the window a foot from
  speedys head and the report of a rifle shot
  echoed against the hills speedy yanked the
  window down

    that son-of-a-gun wants to play he said
  quietly

    yea-a-ah breathed tombstone probly
  irked

  he felt his way over to the door lis-
  tened for a while then locked the door
  and came back to bed speedy was already
  under the blankets tombstone sighed as he
  rolled in

    i feel better now he yawned every-
  thin is cleared up

    speedy sat up suddenly we forgot that
  depot agent he said

    well well probly find him someers
  around in the momin no use botherin

western

about him tonight

  yeah thats right agreed speedy i
hate to be woke up thataway

  i reckon well make it through now  

  it was late next morning when they awoke
the storm had cleared and sunshine slanted
through the windows speedy yawned and
sat up downstairs the telegraph sounder
clicked monotonously

  mebbe we better find the agent sug-
gested speedy after all he treated us fine
yeah agreed tombstone hes a very
thoughtful person but mebbe we better
rustle some breakfast first theres some aigs
on that shelf and coffee mebbe yuh can find
some bacon or ham well find him after
breakfast i hate to do any huntin on a
empty stomach

  they ate a hearty breakfast stacked the
dirty dishes on the table and went down-
stairs the agent was in an arm-chair roped
tightly an old towel tied around his head
and forced between his lips his jaw was too
cramped for conversation and his arms and
legs were numb all in all he was a very
miserable and mad person

  what a way to sleep exclaimed speedy
imagine a man givin up a soft bed to sleep
like this probly walks in his sleep

  mebbe talks in his sleep too added
tombstone soberly

  gradually the agent recovered his speech
and locomotion

  what happened last night he whispered
painfully

  nothin replied tombstone we slept
fine thank yuh

  who tied me up and what for

  you tell us suggested speedy

  some masked men stuck me up and tied
me here you didnt hear em

  no-o-o-o drawled tombstone whyd
they do that

  i dont know you say nothin happened
  nothin happened to us said speedy

  the agent limped over to his desk as the
sounder began clattering again he opened
the key and tapped for a moment shutting
the key and picking up a pencil they
watched him writing a message it was for
them and read

  am not interested in dead horses go to
silverbend and wait a letter wire receipt
of this telegram

  wants a receipt eh grunted speedy
gimme that pencil

  aint interested huh grunted tomb-
stone
the short cut	

 speedy wrote

 received from jim keaton one telegram
without interest on a dead horse riding
double to silverbend

 where-at is silverbend asked tomb-
stone

  its about thirty miles down the line
said the agent huskily

 thirty miles-both of us on one horse

  i didnt put it there snapped the agent
and got busy on his key again

 the two cowpokes went outside

  lovely dove ill bet that bronc is starved
to death right now tombstone said we
forgot him cmon

  but there was no horse no extra saddle
they had tied him inside an old shed but
the shed was empty they went outside and
stood in the warm sunshine

  yuh better wire jim keaton and tell him
were walkin tombstone finally said

  speedy sighed and shook his head thats
what we get for not mindin our own business
last night we bust up a train robbery and
lose our horse and saddles do we get credit
for same we do not them fellers got mad
and set us on foot but we aint walkin-not
as long as freight trains go to silverbend
lets go down the track and wait for one

 they wandered down past the water-tank
and sat down on a pile of old ties beside the
track far up the track a freight whistled

 and we never thanked the agent for his
kindness speedy said

 yuh can send him a card from silver-
bend said tombstone

  but we dont even know his name

 send it to andy the agent at gunsight
depot hell get it

they managed to climb onto a flat-car
as the freight slowed to a walk and then
went on down the winding grades about
ten miles down into a small valley they
stopped at vista robles a three-house town
there were several men at the depot and
two of them got on the caboose about a
mile and a half out of the town was a big
loading corral empty now

 it was past noon when they stopped at
silverbend and the two dusty and tired cow-
boys climbed off the flat-car there is nothing
more miserable than a cowboy without a
horse on the way down they happened to
remember that their war-sacks the wardrobe
trunk of the cowpoke were still tied to the
missing saddles all they had left were the
clothes on their backs

  between them they had forty dollars
business looked good in silverbend which
was a mining town with a cow background
a recent silver strike had given the place a
mild boom tombstone and speedy sized up
the town tombstone had the money in his
pocket but speedy made him split it when
speedy saw a roulette wheel in every saloon
tombstone loved a wheel

  yuh cant get tempted moren twenty
dollars said speedy pocketing his half of
their wealth and twenty dont last long on
a wheel

  they went over in front of the one hotel
in the town and sat down to consider their
next move a tall lean individual came
from the hotel stopped short and looked
them over on the lapel of his stringy vest
was a sheriffs star he wore a walruslike
mustache and his adams apple didnt seem
to be fastened at any spot it moved around

  howdy mister law said speedy and
grinned hows crime

  purty good drawled the sheriff thought-
fully i dont reckon ive see you boys
around here before just got in

 yeah were new to yore domaine
sheriff

  uh-huh uh-huh which way yuh come
  from the north said speedy quickly
  oh yeah-up around red water eh

  gers asked tombstone

  tombstone passed it to speedy who read it
aloud

two masked men tied me up last night and
attempted to stop no forty-five failed
when they smashed the red light one tall
one short may have boarded freight goinc
west

andy wells agent

 the faces of the two cowpokes never
changed expression speedy handed it back
to the sheriff who put it in his pocket
	exciting

  yuh see i have to be careful explained
the sheriff

  yeah thats right agreed tombstone a
sheriff has to

  well much obliged boys ill see yuh
later

  the sheriff went down the street tomb-
stone spat dryly

  if yuh want to send that postcard speedy
andys last name is wells he said

  speedy drew a deep breath that son-of-
a-gun he snorted why if i ever run into
him again  we might both be in jail
right now if you hadnt lied govment
men

  i didnt say we was-he said it

  yeah thats right well we better hire a
room i reckon

chapter hi

govment work

 nside the hotel lobby an
old rancher was talking
loudly to several other
men

  i tell yuh they got
the whole blamed herd
he crackled we threw
over a hundred head of
beef steers into that
loadin corral near vista
robles it was about
noon but there wasnt
no cars spotted for us so
we went to town to wait at dark that
corral was as empty as the sheriffs head-
every cow gone i tell yuh this mornin
we cant find out which way they went
so i caught a freight and come down here
to tell the sheriff a lot of good it done
me he said hed look into it look into it
my gosh youd have thought i complained
about a hole in the ground

  it was the same man they had seen getting
on the freight that morning that empty
loading corral must have been where the
cattle which were stolen had been

  tombstone and speedy paid for a room
then went to the post-office but no letter
had arrived for tombstone jones on the
way back they met sam walters the sheriff
with a short fat deputy who fairly waddled
with his bow-legs he had a peanutlike
nose and a cast in his left eye which gave
him a very confidential expression

  the sheriff introduced him as smoky
falls smokys handshake was a quick
twitch and a quick release his voice was

western

husky as he said

  welcome to silverbend gents any friend
of sams is a friend of-uh-sams glad
to meetcha

ill go up to the depot and send that
telegram to andy wells said the sheriff
i reckon hes been drinkin tequila again
smoky sat down with tombstone and
speedy on the hotel porch

  sam tells me you two are ridin sign for
the govment he said

  secret work said tombstone quietly
yeah cant even hint what she is eh
smoky do yuh read much-books news-
papers et cettery

  i read a book once replied the deputy
what about it

  if yuh read the papers explained tomb-
stone youd see that the scientists claim
that the oceans are shrinkin every year
youve seen a ocean aint yuh

  nope i know there is such things
theyre shrinkin said tombstone a bit
dismally its a awful thing to think about
this here country owns a lot of battleships
and all kinds of boats and weve got to
have someers to float em

  yeah i reckon youve got to have water
for them things

  thats right smoky now dont mention
this to a soul but me and sleepy are lookin
over this country trying to find the right
spot to put a- new ocean and-tombstone
lowered his voice carefully-i dont mind
tellin you that this here valley is just
what weve been lookin for

  yea-a-ah well uh-but whatll yuh do
for water

  water tombstone laughed shortly
smoky youd be surprised all we have
to do is put a ce-ment bottom in this here
valley and the rainll do the rest its a
cinch

  yeah i can see where- smoky blinked
thoughtfully cement bottom in the valley
suddenly he said quietly ill buy a drink
i thought i was a pretty fair two-handed
liar but i find i aint been around enough
cmon

  as they started to leave the hotel the
old cattleman came out he was still fuming
about his lost cattle he saw smoky and
said

 well aint you and that bug-headed
sheriff gone huntin the men that stole my
cows

  well get around to it rio assured
smoky i want yuh to meet mr jones
and mr smith rio gents this is rio boggs
which owns the circle b spread out there
the short cut	

in the wilderness north of vista robles

old rio shook hands gravely with the
two cowpokes

 jones he said thoughtfully i knowed
 a jones once awful nice feller named
 zibe

well well exclaimed tombstone my
missin uncle zibe jones we aint heard
from him for years awful nice feller-

 down here to report a rustlin job wasted
 time a hundred head of fat beef-gone

 rio stared at him for a moment

harshly

no replied tombstone meekly if i
was tryin to be smart id ask yuh who took
em what was the circumstances of the
disappearance

 they was stolen

oh they was where-at

rio boggs choked back a suppressed de-
sire to throttle tombstone he sighed deeply
and turned to smoky

after tm gone to the depot got on the
train and am half-way to vista robles will
you take this gent aside and tell him where
my cows were stolen-if its any of his blasted
business

rio boggs whirled and bow-legged his
way toward the depot tombstone grinned
slowly

well do yuh still want to know tomb-
stone smoky said

 no-o-o-o i dont reckon so smoky you
 spoke about a drink

in the silver star saloon they met ed
ferris buyer for the silver queen mines
where five hundred miners were employed

ed used to was a cowpoke said smoky
like me he reformed

ferris bought a drink he wanted to
know what outfits they had worked for
where they came from and where were
they going

 theyre on a secret mission for the gov-
 ment said smoky

 secret huh queried ferris

so secret confided speedy that me

and tombstone only knows half the ques-
tion-me half and him half

  well how can yuh ever ask anybody the
question

 that said tombstone is why we
stopped here we wanted a nice quiet place
to figure it out ourselves

  it sounds crazy to me declared ferris
not when yuh know the answer
well do you know the answer asked
ferris quickly

  shore tombstone nodded soberly tve
knowed it all the time

  but-well if you knowed the answer
why didnt they-

  confidentially said speedy hes such
a liar that they didnt believe him they
sent us down here to prove it

  huh grunted ferris thoughtfully

  i can believe part of it-them not be-
lievin him smoky said

  do you buy beef ferris asked tomb-
stone

  ferris looked curiously at the tall lean
cowpoke

  with over five hundred men to feed three
times a day what do you think

nope-we buy anywhere have you got
any to sell jones

  not here down in texas ive got-well

  ferris laughed and told them he had to
go back to the mine they went outside
and ran into the sheriff

  i sent a telegram to that crazy agent at
gunsight he told them i want some
more information about that attempted train
robbery the agent here hadnt heard a
thing about it except that telegram that
andy wells sent me hes trying to find out
more from the division superintendent if
he knowed that one man was tall and the
other short he must have somethin more
thatll help us

 yeah said tombstone soberly he
should

speedy was worried and he explained
his worry to tombstone

 nobody knows us nobody saw us at
gunsight if that blasted agent wants to
identity us as the two men who tried to
stick up that train what defense have we


exciting western

got the answer is-none

  well i heard- began tombstone

  the jury aint interested in what yuh
heard tombstone theyre only interested
in what yuh know

  well jim keaton can prove we aint
train robbers

 can he how

  thats right-he cant but he can prove
we was at gunsight

  thatll help us a whole lot mebbe they
couldnt convict us but id hate to stay in
jail a month or two waitin for a trial
mebbe we better pull out speedy
yeah and make it look worsen ever
anyway were half-out of horses and sad-
dles if you remember

  yeah i can remember that

  tombstone got into a poker game that
evening simply because he didnt have
money enough to make a good play at the
roulette wheel speedy refused to let him
have any of his money tombstone wasnt
a good poker player and speedy figured
they were or soon would be half-out of
money so speedy went back to the hotel
sat around for a while and then went up to
the post-office to see if that letter from jim
keaton had arrived- it had speedy put it
in his pocket and started back to the hotel

  it was quite dark along that particular
stretch of sidewalk and speedy was about
half-way back to the hotel when something
struck him over the head he was walking
near the inside of the walk and someone
must have used a pick-handle at any rate
his consciousness went out in a shower of
shooting stars and he was jerked off the
sidewalk

  the next thing he remembered he was on
the sidewalk doing a very erratic job of loco-
motion not understanding why the seas
were so heavy and not exactly caring a
whole lot there was no one in the little
hotel lobby so speedy managed to get up
the stairs where he considered everything
concerned after due deliberation he man-
aged to remember the location of their room
and reached there eventually

  the dusty mirror showed him hatless and
with a lump the size of a hens egg over his
left ear a trickle of blood on the side of his
face and very dusty clothes

  smith yore a mess if i ever seen one
he said

  his gun was still in his holster but the
letter was gone speedy wet a towel and
sat down holding it against his head some-
one had hit him and taken that letter his
mind was still a little hazy when tombstone

came in tombstone threw some money on
the table and sent his hat spinning over on
the bed

  i won three hundred and sixty dollars
he exclaimed triumphantly i went down
to the feed corral bought two horses two
saddles and theres seventeen dollars left
and you said i cant play poker

  speedy didnt say anything tombstone
sat down and looked at him

  lovely dove he blurted didja fall
down the stairs look at that knob man
you-what hit yuh

  ive been robbed replied speedy wearily
i got that letter from jim keaton at the
post-office and someers between here and
there somebody patted me on the head with
a wagon-tongue and took the letter
yuh did whatd the letter say

  i hadnt opened it sighed speedy
mebbe it had money in it and they
knowed it

  why would jim keaton send us money
countered speedy

  thats right-he wouldnt weu ill be
darned hit yuh over the head and stole a
letter from jim keaton dont make sense
mebbe it was somebody that never had a
letter

  wait a minute interrupted speedy jim
keaton was sendin us some instructions in
that letter mebbe    wait a minute we
sent that telegram from gunsight and we
got the answer there jim said he was
sendin us a letter yuh know somethin
speedy rubbed his sore head tm goin
back to gunsight and pistol-whip andy
wells he told somebody about that letter
and theyve got it

  ill betcha thats it speedy jim keaton
had a important job for us and now we
dont know what it is what do yuh think
about me winnin some rollin-stock for
us i drawed four cards to an inside
straight

  you done what asked speedy drawed
four cards to an inside straight

spot and got all the rest and you alius say

  i take it all back sighed speedy ill
never again say that you cant play poker
but i will say that you dont even know
the first thing about the game draw four
cards to an inside straight

  well admitted tombstone reluctantly
i will agree that there was a element of
luck connected with it but after this ill
stick to good old draw poker roulette is
all luck
tiie short cut

  i think said speedy soberly ill let
you get the mail next time

chapter iv

kind and patient

y next morning the
swelling was down a
little but speedy was
still obliged to wear his
hat jauntily on one side
of his head after they
found it against the
sidewalk where he had
been when he was hit
after breakfast they met
sam walters the sheriff

  this is a good one
boys walters said
that agent andy wells never reported that
attempted robbery to the railroad company
they dont know anythin about it not
only that but andy wells wired his resigna-
tion yesterday afternoon and walked off the
job before they could send in a relief man
the company wants me to find andy wells

 what do they want him for asked
tombstone

 they want to know why he reported
an attempted holdup to me and not to them

  jealous huh

  i suppose so sighed the sheriff

  sheriff said speedy did rio boggs
ever have cattle stolen before i mean did
he complain before this hundred head was
taken

  well yea-a-ah he did several times
me and smoky spent a week up there but
we didnt find nothin

  what other spreads are up in that neigh-
borhood

  well the broken fork spread is north
of boggs place it aint a big outfit belongs
to tom sneed he only hires a couple men-

id

feller they dont get down here very often
do their tradin at vista robles mostly

ride alone

  this fits in just right speedy said to
tombstone id bet a hundred dollars against
a doughnut that jim keaton told us in
that letter to go see rio boggs

  ill take the bet said tombstone soberly
it aint like me to gamble but them odds
are too good to pass up why on earth would
he ask us to see rio boggs

  the association replied speedy is con-
cerned with cattle thieves and rio boggs
has been losin cows yuh dont have to be
awful smart to figure things out let them
pirates have that letter we dont need it
yeah agreed tombstone with our
brains we dont need letters

  with our brains added speedy we
better start gettin smart

turn page
	exciting

  to do detectin asked tombstone

 no-to keep from gettin shot every
rustler in the country knows who we are
by this time them train robbers has got a
mad on against us and were goin to stick
our necks right into the lions den

  why speedy how you talk were just
goin to try and find the pore scrawny little
andy wells

 andy wells never stole them hundred
head of cows-but he was in with the train
robbers you heard what they said andy
wells is a mucho malo hombre if yuh ask
me he got scared and quit his job

  we better saddle up them new horses
said tombstone well match to see which
one we take smoky ort to be ready by this
time

  the two horses tombstone had purchased
were a tall mean-looking gray mare and
a snake-headed roan they solemnly flipped
a coin and tombstone won he took the
gray they got their saddles and went into
the corral where the roan proceeded to
chase speedy over the fence he came back
to the gate uncoiling his rope in time to
see tombstone fling his saddle into the
roans face and also climb the fence

  he probly knows yuh held one card and
drew a straight said the skinny speedy
i thought you bought two horses not
tigers

  watch me out-smart him said tomb-
stone

  he shook out his loop made a long cast
and dropped the loop over the roans head

he quickly snubbed the animal to
the fence while speedy went into the
corral roped the horse from another angle
and tied off the rope the gray stood there
dumbly watching the show while speedy
and tombstone saddled the roan which now
seemed about half-out of fight

  smoky riding a bay gelding came over
to the fence

  yuh better put glue on that saddle ad-
vised smoky

  i drawed him and fll ride him panted
speedy

 the gray never moved a muscle while
tombstone drew the cinch tight they led
the two horses out into the street speedy
went into the saddle like a cat and the roan
whirled wildly but never offered to buck
tombstone chuckled as he swung up

  i like em kind and patient he said
mebbe theyre a little slower but awful re-
liable cmon ol man river

 tombstone touched the gray with his

western

spurs and it was just like throwing an
electric switch that slow-looking gray
bogged its head going half as high as the
corral fence and putting on as dizzy an
exhibition of plain and fancy bucking as
silverbend had ever seen

  tombstone caught off balance lasted just
four jumps landed standing up in the
watering-trough and threw water all over
the place the gray whirled against the
corral fence stopped and shook itself

  kind and patient remarked speedy
ol man river my my

  tombstone walked back to the gray leaned
against the fence while he poured the water
out of his boots and told that gray a few
things regarding its ancestry then he
climbed into the saddle whirled the animal
around socked in the spurs-but nothing
happened

all cocked and primed but the trigger
stuck said speedy yuh cant never tell

turned him over to the stable man and told
him he could have all over fifty dollars
well you blasted burglars exclaimed
tombstone i paid him a hundred dollars
i know it he gave me my fifty

stone

  that replied smoky will require some
research

  it was late that night when they reached
the circle b everybody was in bed except
rio boggs who was suffering from tooth-
ache he stood aside as they trooped into
the main room of the rancbhouse

  what have i done to deserve this he
said

 in his high-heel boots cursing his aching
 tooth

 he aint got nobody but himself to blame
 declared tombstone id shore like to take
 it out for him its awful simple

 not as simple as hed be to let yuh
 said speedy go to sleep

 it was just getting daylight when rio
 boggs came part way down the stairs and
 called softly

 jones are yuh awake jones
 tombstone slid out of his blankets and

went up the stairs preceded by rio who
had difficulty in keeping upright the smoky
oil lamp disclosed about one drink left in
a quart bottle rio was blind drunk but
suffering tombstone wore a sagging union
suit his hair standing up on his head rio
sat down on the edge of the bed

  youve gotta pull it he declared im
goin crazy

  everythin points thataway agreed
tombstone examining the pair of pliers
he yawned and scratched his head before
handing rio the bottle yuh better finish
it he said rio did

  i wish i was as drunk as you are-thisd
be fun he said

  he tried to prop rio up in the chair but
he kept sliding out so he put him on the
bed pulled the table close to the bed and
moved the lamp to a new position rio
opened his mouth at tombstones suggestion
and tried to point out the offending molar
with a stubby finger

  agh-h-thug-g-g-ssn he said doogle-
ugh-fizzoli

  the same to you and may they all come
true said tombstone

  he looked the tooth over critically it
looked bad rio closed his mouth and al-
most bit tombstones finger so he pried
the mouth open got a-straddle of rios head
and held it open

  the operation had to be done quickly he
set the pliers around the tooth twisted
hard hard-and the roots let loose then
he triumphantly slid off the bed and held
up the tooth in the pliers

  nobody can ever say that i cant pull
teeth he declared thats as clean a job
as i ever seen bar none

  rio was snoring so tombstone padded
back down to his bed-roll and crawled- in

  rio didnt come down to breakfast hop
lee the old chinese cook let the boys
sleep late before calling them to breakfast
he knew smoky falls the other cowboys
had all gone to work rio was still in bed
when the boys finished breakfast

waving both arms

mebbe he was too drunk to know which
one ached well anyway he wont have that
tooth to worry about later on in life some
day hell thank me

tombstone dryly

chapter v

dynamite

or no particular reason
except that they had to
do something they rode
to gunsight the new
agent didnt know andy
wells but didnt blame
andy for leaving the
job it was a lonesome
place to live tombstone
speedy and smoky sat
on the old platform and
watched a freight train
go past

 yuh know said tombstone tve got
me a idea

  it must be repulsive t say the least
remarked smoky you had one last night-
and pulled the wrong tooth

  no it aint nothin like that yuh know
speedy ive been thinkin about that jasper
that shot at us back in that canyon that
was late in the afternoon and-

it was almost dark corrected speedy
yeah it was well yuh could easy steal
a cow at vista robles and drive it up here
in that lenth of time mebbe that was rio
boggs hundred head

  wait a minute snorted smoky whats
this all about anyway you aint supposed
to have been here

  listen my child said speedy soberly
and i will tell thee

and speedy proceeded to tell smoky

falls all about their experience in reaching
gunsight and what happened there that
night smoky wasnt inclined to believe
all of it especially about speedy shooting
out the red light and saving the train
you read that someers declared smoky
we lived it feller declared speedy
well why didnt yuh tell the railroad
company and git a reward

 and have andy wells swear that we
was the robbers not a chance

  yeah i can see that angle huh heroes
in disguise

  heroes in disgust corrected speedy
and let me tell yuh how i got that knob
on m head

 knob why tombstone said that was
the handle yore folks used to pick yuh up
with when yuh was a child howd it
happen

  speedy had to tell him about the telegrams
to jim keaton and the loss of the letter
smoky marveled openly

  this whole thing he said would make
a awful good story to tell somebody that
dont know either one of yuh where do we
go next

  were goin back up that canyon and try
to find them cows

  speedy yore crazy-cow-crazy fd say
yea-a-ah which way is the broken
fork spread from here

  smoky studied the hills scratched his
head thoughtfully and finally pointed in the
general direction as well as he was able

  all right said tombstone that canyon
must head within ten miles of the broken
fork probly on their spread looks better
all the time

  smoky shook his head the broken fork
are honest men tom sneed aint no
rustler

  listen smoky said speedy soberly
when the world has picked out the dumbest
man they can find ill match you agin him
and win hands down you set there and say
hes honest what proves it

  well replied smoky sheepishly he
aint never been in jail

  and that said tombstone dont prove
anythin with the present officers in the
office at silverbend and if bluebeard lived
there he could kill forty more wives and
you wouldnt know it

  not even if they yelled all together
added speedy

  all right all right growled smoky
well look at yore canyon

  you aint so hard to convince after all
said speedy i thought youd be stubborn
the short cut	

 they left gunsight and headed for the
canyon which was easy to find as was the
old trail but the rain had washed out all
tracks of cattle and horses smoky was
still unbelieving they showed him where
they were forced to climb to higher ground
but there was nothing to show him that
they were not still lying

  the old trail led to the top where a long
mesa stretched in every direction they
finally found a trail which had been cut up
with cattle tracks and followed it smoky
had no idea which direction was toward the
broken fork an overcast sky had ruined
their ideas of direction so they just kept
on riding

 we cant go back to the boggs ranch
said smoky  rio would massacree all
of us it kin da looks like a dry camp for
tonight

it was getting rather late when they
rode out along a brushy point where
they stopped and dismounted to try and
get their bearings the land sloped sharply
below them and they could see the outlines
of an old abandoned shaft-house smoky
grew a bit enthusiastic

 thats the old gray ghost mine he
exclaimed it aint been worked for twenty-
five years i know where we are now
where asked tombstone

  well were right here replied smoky
that old mine is about ten miles from the
broken fork ranchhouse

 which way asked speedy

 that admitted smoky is a problem
ill be darned if i just know wait a minute
there used to be a old road that went past
the broken fork and down through sole-
dad canyon and-i aint shore but i think
it came out someers around where the
silver queen mine is now mebbe we can
find that road

 hold fast exclaimed tombstone
theres a rider down there hes behind
that big patch of mesquite now watch on
that right-hand side there he is leadin
his horse

 theres a shack down there exclaimed
speedy quietly see it

 thats where hes a-headin for said
smoky yuh can see the front and one
side who do yuh reckon he is

 hes stopped and l lookin around
said speedy now hes goin

  ill betcha hes seen us said tombstone
watch that hombre

 the man led his horse around behind the
house where he left it he came around to

the front and stood there looking all around
for a matter of minutes before he went into
the house and closed the door

  he wasnt in there very long but appeared
at the back of the place where he seemed
to be scrutinizing the surroundings care-
fully finally he led his horse away down
through the brush where he mounted in
the heavy cover and rode swiftly away down
a trail

  and that declared tombstone aint
normal

  they mounted and rode down to the old
shack it was a very old one-room house
and smoky said he believed it had been
built by an old wolfer who trapped in
there for years speedy started to go up
to the front door but tombstone stopped
him

  aint i never learned yuh to not do
that he asked be shore yore right before
yuh open a front door cmon

  they went around to the rear there
was another door and a muchly-patched
window the back door was locked with
a padlock tombstone tested the window
twisted a couple of crooked nails aside and
took the whole thing out then he pulled
himself up went in head-first and pulled
his feet after him the other two looked
through the window as tombstone lighted
a candle

  well we wont starve he called to
them plenty food

  unfasten that front door will yuh
asked speedy

  speedy and smoky went around to the
front tombstone was mumbling to himself
but finally opened the old door

  it wasnt locked he said quietly as the
door swung outward

  whyd he lock the back door asked
speedy

  heres why replied tombstone see
that little wire it was wound around that
nail on the door open the door-pull the
wire

  whatd that do asked smoky curiously

  tombstone was down on his knees easing
away a piece of the old flooring following
the small wire which ended up in the top
of a fifty-pound box of high percentage dy-
namite an old single-action six-shooter had
been wired tightly cocked and pointing
into a box of detonators the small wire
was wrapped around the trigger of the gun

  lovely dove breathed speedy one
yank on that door-a nice evenin to you
saint peter why that fifty pounds of
dynamite would have moved this layout
	exciting western

plumb to nevady

  tombstone smiled grimly and that dirty

killer is someers down the mesa listenin
for our demise if he dont hear no blast hell
figure we didnt find the place mebbeso
hell come back

  yea-a-ah bretthed speedy and get
the drop on us im outside if anybody wants
me

they closed the door and went to their
horses leading them back into the brush
where they loosened the saddles and moved
back quietly with their bed-rolls tomb-
stone went into the house secured three cans
of baked beans and came back

  dynamite dont hurt my appetite he told
them

  they sprawled on their bed-rolls and ate
the beans after an hour or so they went to
bed but the man never came back

 after daylight tombstone and speedy
searched the old shack while smoky kept
watch but there was nothing to indicate
ownership they took enough food for
breakfast got their weary horses and rode
up to the old shaft-house a half-mile away
where they ate their meal

  there was little left of the old shaft-house
but they found unmistakable evidence that
butchering had been done there and re-
cently there were many burro tracks around
the outside tracks of high-heeled boots
cigarette butts and the rim of the old two-
hundred-and-fifty-foot shaft showed that it
had been made the receptacle of all the offal

  smoky sat down and studied the situation
but it was beyond him

  i figure it thisaway said speedy some-
body stole cows butchered em here and
packed the meat on burros where they
went weve got to find out whose cows-
quien sabe the hides are two hundred and
fifty feet down if yore estimate of depth is
correct

  i reckon im right as to depth said
smoky

  all right said tombstone well hit
that old road thatll show the burro tracks
foller em to the bitter end-and there yuh
are

  they found the old road but there were
no burro tracks for two miles they fol-
lowed it but nary a track

  a right good idea busted sighed tomb-
stone yuh say this road leads to the
broken fork ranchhouse smoky

  i think it does or awful close

  yore a swell guide remarked speedy
well probly end up in philadelphia is

there a road from the broken fork to rio
boggs place 

  no there aintf but i can find my way to
 the circle b

  do yuh suppose yuh can find it for all
three of us asked tombstone wed like
to go along yuh know

  glad to have yuh mebbe we better pick
a few flowers along the way in case rio
boggs gets a good shot at yuh

  aw hes forgot that tooth by this time
 anyway i aint scared of the little side-
 winder if he monkeys with me ill pull em
 au out

chapter vi

vista robles

hen they found the
broken fork ranch-
house it was past noon-
time there was no one
at home except the pot-
bellied old cook who
looked them over sadly
he was a frowsy old
rannahan badly in need
of a haircut and some
clean clothes

he said huskily

  tom i dunno said he might go to

 misery made vague gestures which
covered a lot of country

here

  yeah kinda washed out years ago
yuh can foller it almost down to the silver
queen if yuh know the trail yuh can
make it hongry

  thats right misery got any grain for
the horses
the short cut	

help yourself down at the stable ill
rustle yuh a snack

they fed their hungry horses and went
back to the house miserys kitchen was
almost as dirty as his person but the food
was good as they ate their meal misery
squatted in the kitchen doorway smoking his
pipe

where-at did you fellers come from
he asked

well replied tombstone weve been
kinda in a circle last night we slept at
the old gray ghost mine

misery took his pipe from his mouth and
stared at it for a moment

there-uh-aint no place to sleep up
there

that shaft-house is kinda dirty ad-
mitted tombstone but it kept the wind
off us

 the-uh-shaft-house all fallen in aint
 it

 no its pretty good yet needs cleanin
 up dont smell good misery who owns a
 pack-train of burros around here

burros i dunno whod use burros

the kind that dont make tracks in the
road

kind that dont    hu-u-uh misery
stared at tombstone i dunno what yuh
mean

 misery got up with visible effort because
 of his paunch and filled their cups with
 coffee

be back in a few minutes he said
huskily and went down across the yard
toward the stable

smoky stared at tombstone

 whats the idea of sayin things like that
 to him he asked

what would he know about it added
speedy

thats what i wondered replied tomb-
stone moving his chair back he must
know somethin about that old shaft-house
he said there wasnt any place to sleep up
there

 yeah said speedy yeah he did didnt
 he huh

tombstone stepped over to the one win-
dow and looked out as he rolled a cigarette
the other two finished their coffee tomb-
stone finally came back and sat down after
filling his cup again

 tastes like stewed gunny-sack he said
 but i like it

smoky yawned and reached for his to-
bacco

which way is vista robles from here
smoky tombstone said down that way

 tombstone pointed toward the back of
the kitchen smoky looked got up and
stepped outside

 thats right he said howd you
know

  i thought it might be thats the way
misery miller went

mokys jaw sagged

 mu-misery miller he asked
why he aint gone is he

  yeah he circled away from the stable
hit the brush but headed that way i just
had a hunch he was goin to vista robles
he saddled a horse asked speedy

  or had it saddled already tombstone
nodded he shore high-tailed it out of here
mebbe i made him nervous

  well ill be chinamans great-aunt
snorted smoky you ask him some crazy-
no yuh didnt ask him yuh told him crazy
things and off he goes leavin us here it
dont make sense any way yuh look at it
hes probly a sensitive soul said tomb-
stone jist cant bear to listen

  but whats he headin for vista robles
for asked smoky

  probly goin to call out the militia said
speedy mebbe he thinks tombstone is
crazy and needs a keeper

 and again-tombstone smiled-mebbe
he thinks we know so much that hed better
warn the rest of the world to look out for
us if yuh dont mind gents i think we
better head for vista robles

  we cant make it by dark said speedy
its a long ways

  the darker the better said tombstone
soberly and we better not ride in a bunch
either i dont think misery miller went
down to get a brass band to greet us at
vista robles

  darkness came when they were only half-
way to vista robles that rutty old road
seemed to wind all over the landscape an
hour later they strung out in single-file
traveling as fast as possible but it was after
nine oclock before they saw the few fights
of vista robles

  quietly they swung off the road and circled
the little town coming to a halt in the deep
shadows of some cottonwoods about two
hundred yards from the main part of town

  just what do we do here asked smoky
you aint said

  i dont know replied tombstone weve
got to find misery miller-if hes here yuh
must figure out that he didnt come here
just for a ride somethin is on foot

  i hope it wont be us said speedy we

  well split up and make a search said
tombstone smoky you take a look at
this side of the street the store is still
open ill check up on the saloon and
around there and speedy will injun around
the depot then well meet at the right-
hand end of the depot ill check on the
hitchrack at the saloon lets go

  rio boggs came to vista robles about
seven oclock that evening he was nurs-
ing a swollen jaw a hangover and his usual
dreary outlook on life in general he had
made his mind up to get on the first passen-
ger train no matter which way it was going
and find some town where there was a
dentist

  rio hadnt had more than five or six
drinks when in walked sam walters the
sheriff dusty and tired rio greeted him with
a bellow

wheres that half-witted deputy of yours
and his ignorant pardners he demanded
sam walters looked rio over critically
which one of em kicked yuh on the
jaw rio he said

they aint men enough to kick me on
the jaw walters if i find that long-geared
jones ill cut his throat from ear to ear
if youll shut up long enough to swaller
ill buy yuh a drink

  well yeah i can shore but if yore
tooth ached like mine-

  why dont yuh get it pulled

  pulled where thats why im here
got to take a train to a dentist

  if i had some pliers- began the sheriff
but rio exploded

  you too eh pliers look at this
mulffigzz uggle zugg-ff

  rio shoved a finger in his mouth and
explained fluently

  eskimo if i ever heard it spoke the
bartender said

  the tooth is out said the sheriff

 a good one is out yuh mean that
blasted long-legged half-witted limber-
jawed-

  yuh mean jones pulled the wrong tooth
asked the sheriff

  the best tooth i had if i ever find
him-

didnt yuh show him which one rio
rio sighed deeply i-i dont remember
sam i drank a whole quart tryin to kill
the pain when i woke up my good tooth
was gone

  and so was jones huh queried the
sheriff

  did he take the tooth asked the bar-
tender

rio downed his drink and leaned his
elbows on the bar

 whatr you doin up here sam he
asked

  oh i just rode over to look around
whered smoky and the others go after
they left yore place

  i dunno hop lee said they went toward
gunsight if it hadivt been for that peace-
lovin chinee id have massacreed jones
sam walters leaned on the bar and
squinted at the fly-specked mirror over
the backbar

  zeke he said to the bartender you
aint seen andy wells around here have
yuh

  no i aint sam

  for gosh sake whats that shrimp done
grunted rio boggs smoky and his canni-
bals asked the same question youd think
he was wanted for murder-or is he

  the sheriff shook his head no charge
rio i just want to talk with him

  thats punishment enough fr one man
to stand id almost as soon have a tooth-
ache fill em up alex my train wont

where jones is huh

  hes with smoky wherever smoky is-
which i dont know well heres hopin the
next tooth out will be the right one

  i hope so if it aint ill be mumblinm
food for a long time

  as they put down their glasses misery
miller walked in he had no coat wore an
old pair of slippers and the hat he wore
didnt fit him he had picked it up in the
stable on his hurried departure he saw
the sheriff hesitated but came on up to
the bar

  howdy misery said the sheriff you
look like yuh went off half-cocked

  when misery gets dry said rio he
dont stop to dress

  aint that true added the bartender
i member one time that misery was here
two days drinkin straight whisky and all
he had on was his boots drawers and a
slicker and it was a hundred and ten in
the shade a thirst like that is a awful thing
misery grinned with evident relief being
eccentric has its advantages rio bought a
drink

 hows tom and the boys asked the
sheriff

  theyre fine i git lonesome for a drink
once in a while fill em up zeke
the short cut

ment inaugurated by the sheriffs office in

mself said the sheriff

chapter vn

plotters

peedy smith wasnt
having much luck with
his part of the search
he worked his way
around behind the store
reached the comer
where he peered into a
comer of a front win-
dow two or three men
were in there but no
misery miller as
speedy sagged back off
the wooden walk a gun
was jabbed into his back

 back up and keep yore hands high
hombre a voice whispered

  shore whispered speedy comm back

  speedy started slow but went into high-
gear suddenly he kicked back trying to
locate a shin-bone twisted away from the
gun but his kick was wide and the next
thing his lights went out in a shower of
stars the man picked speedy up in his
arms and went staggering away in the dark-
ness

  tombstone jones was having a little better
luck he located the hitchrack where he
was able to look over the three horses one
was the sweat-coated black that misery
miller had ridden from the broken fork
the sorrel belonged to sam walters the
sheriff of silverbend and the hammer-
headed buckskin was the same horse that
tombstone had seen at the circle b be-
longing to rio boggs

 misery miller sam walters and rio



boggs muttered tombstone huh

 he saw misery miller come from the
saloon heading down the small sidewalk to
the hitchrack tombstone crouched behind
the sheriffs horse which was at the end of
the rack misery stepped off the end of
the walk

  misery a voice called quietly from the
heavy shadows beside the saloon

 the broken fork cook stopped short
looking in that direction the voice called
a name which tombstone couldnt hear and
the old cook walked quickly into the shadow
tombstone listened closely the two men
were talking too quietly for him to hear
much although he did hear them mention
smoky and walters then he heard avoice
say

  we know it-we got one of em

  then the two men moved away together
tombstone tried to figure out what this was
all about was it another attempted train
robbery he wondered he went over and
managed to look into the saloon rio boggs
sam walters and the bartender were play-
ing three-handed poker

  the whole thing was very puzzling to the
tall cowboy something was going on in
vista robles but the sheriff didnt know it
misery had thrown all caution to the winds
and headed for vista robles to warn some-
body warn them of what warn them that
their butchering spot had been uncovered
if so why were they in vista robles it
didnt make sense

  tombstone drifted out behind the saloon
out in the direction taken by misery miller
and the other man there was an old corral
out there partly fallen down but no build-
ings he could see a darker mass beyond
which might mean buildings but it proved
to be only a grove of cottonwoods and two
walls of an old adobe he sat down to think
some more and heard a horse paw the
ground

  pushing cautiously through the brush he
found the horses tied deep in among the
trees seven saddled horses

  seven muttered tombstone only three
men at the broken fork it looks kinda
funny

 then he made another discovery one
of the horses was the one which had been
stolen from him at gunsight it was his
saddle too seven horses all saddled hidden
away in the brush too that meant dirty
work of some kind

  youll walk home if yuh dont mind
he muttered and proceeded to untie six
of the animals tied up the tie-ropes and
exciting western



let the animals loose

  they were willing to drift he kept his
own horse moving it to another spot a
hundred yards away

  if somethin pops he declared some-
body is goin to be headin away from here
on foot

in the meantime smoky falls was being
very cautious he had circled the depot
twice he had crouched for a long time
against a pile of old railroad ties but heard
nothing saw nothing it was plainly evident
to smoky that everything was normal
around the vista robles depot the depot
office was lighted and once he saw the agent
come outside

  smoky wanted a cigarette so he made
his way back to the depot platform where
tombstone had told the other two to meet
him sat down and rolled a smoke they
should be coming along shortly he lighted
the cigarette and relaxed wondering what
had become of misery miller and why he
had nan out on them queer thing to do

  a man came quietly around the corner
of the platform ten feet away

  everythin is quiet around here speedy
said smoky find out anythin

  it wasnt speedy the muzzle of a double-
barrel shotgun prodded into smoky falls
waist-line

  slide off there and shut up a husky
voice said

  smoky slid-and he didnt make any re-
marks a deft hand removed his gun from
the holster and the man prodded him in
the back

  get goin he whispered and if you
make one fool move youll get it

  i wont assured smoky you do the
guidin

  straight ahead-and shut up

  the two men disappeared in the dark-
ness leaving everything serene around the
depot again

  not far away tombstone leaned on the
hitchrack in the deep shadows and watched
a long freight train pass through vista
robles when the caboose rattled out of
sight down through the mesquite tomb-
stone decided to keep his tryst with smoky
and speedy

  at least he could tell them that the broken
fork cook had contacted somebody and
that he had found seven horses including
his own also that rio boggs and sam
walters were in the saloon playing poker
with the bartender tombstone wished he
was too poker was more fun than playing

hide-and-seek with danger

  tombstone circled the depot keeping far
away from any lights but saw nothing of
speedy and smoky they were certainly
not where he had told them to meet him
he went back to the street and circled the
general store it was all very peculiar

  over in the saloon the three men hunched
over the poker table there had been little
conversation the snapping of a card the
rattle of poker-chips was about the only i
sound

  what the devil became of misery sam
walters said finally

  yeah said the bartender three off the
top rio

  he said he was goin to stable his horse
remarked the sheriff been gone almost an
hour wonder what happened to the old
soak fell down and cant get up i wonder
give me one rio hows the tooth

  never mind the tooth growled the old
cowman easin up a little nobody opened
it i cant aint had openers since sittin
bull stood up wonder if its pretty near 
train time ive got to take a trip-if this 
tooth dont stop achin cuss that long-geared
gimlet-eyed jones got m head between
his knees and yanked out a good tooth
too bad he didnt pull all of em said
the bartender i hate to hear anybody brag-
gin about bein in pain ive done my share
of sufferin but i done her in silence

  you aint got brains enough to know
where yuh ache zeke takes a smart man
to suffer properly get the bottle will yuh

  and the law takes the pot on three
aces declared the sheriff a few minutes
later i wonder where misery miller went

the old rannahan

  not me declared the bartender if he
never come back ill give three cheers hes
a darned pest spends a week down here
pourin whisky down into his bottomless pit

  i didnt know he could sing said rio
he darned well cant does it anyway
pass

  have yuh heard anythin about yore
missin cows rio asked the sheriff ab-
sently

  didja think theyd send me a postal card
misery miller came back and leaned
against the bar the sheriff looked him over
curiously draped around his waist almost
hidden by his pot belly was a gun-belt
holding a holstered gun the sheriff knew
that misery had not been wearing any gun
the short cut

before and there was something familiar
about that gun butt

zeke got up and poured a drink for
misery who turned to the bar giving
the sheriff a good view of that gun-butt
the sheriff rubbed his shin thoughtfully
misery miller was wearing smoky falls
gun that gun was smokys most precious
possession he wouldnt sell it to anybody
at any price the sheriff lost interest in the
poker game

  rio boggs took another stiff drink of raw
whisky spilled all his poker chips on the
floor and kicked them aside with his foot

  gotta git a train pretty shoon he an-
nounced goin shome place

  i reckon the games closed zeke said
the sheriff

  zeke picked up all the chips cashed them
in and shoved the money into rios pocket

  f yuh shee jones lemme know will
yuh asked rio drowsily

  id shore like to see him said the
sheriff grimly id kinda like to see smoky
too

  misery miller paid no attention to the
sheriffs wants

  thats pretty good liquor zeke he said
fill er up agin  

  outside of the saloon down at the depot
tombstone jones circled the saloon again and
cautiously made his way up to the depot
but the rear platform was still empty there
was no doubt in his mind that something had
happened to speedy and smoky or theyd
have been there before this tombstone
crouched in the shadow wondering what to
do next

  about a hundred yards up the track was
an old tool house used by the section crew
it was barely visible-a black spot in the
night tombstone decided not to overlook
anything and that tool house seemed about
the only thing he hadnt investigated

 traveling carefully he made his way
around below the old shanty where he
stopped for a while watching the place then
he saw a man come out-just a moving blur
in the darkness watching closely he saw
the man go back in a few moments at
least there was someone in the tool house

  tombstone circled around to the back and
crawled the last hundred feet to the rear
of the house it was not a big place possibly
a dozen feet wide and fifteen feet long he
edged in against the rear and listened closely
after a while he was sure he could hear
muffled voices but was unable to hear whak
was said there were no windows in the



place and the walls were fairly thick

  after a long wait he heard more low voices
but they were outside now at first it was
difficult to understand what they said but
tljeir voices were higher now

  like i said weve got to be careful a
voice said we aint goin to lose this
chance cause well never have another if
what misery says is true the whole deal is
busted up and well have to scatter but
itll be worth it

  yeah all right said another voice nerv-
ously lets get this all straight four of
us scatter out one goes to the horses and
brings em in behind the saloon one watches
the front of the saloon another the front of
the store and one to the rear of the store
if anythin starts we start shootin you
pull the job head for the horses and away
we go am i right

  thats right in less than ten minutes the
train will be here ill handle my end of the
deal dont forget that jones is somewhere
in town misery can handle the sheriff when
things bust all set lets go-but take it
easy weve got time dont make any move
until i give the signal

  tombstone was unable to recognize any
of the voices the five men melted away in
the darkness headed for the main street

  this dont look like a train robbery
declared tombstone to himself one man
pulls the job while four men block anybody
from interferin thais awful queer mebbe
we better look in on the deal

chapter viii

double roundup

oving past the old tool
house tombstone
headed for the depot
plainly visible with its
lighted front but the
tall cowboy had not lost
his caution these men
were dangerous and
they were intending to
pull a big job of some
kind something that
they had said was worth
it

  tombstone reached the end of the plat-
form where he had agreed to meet speedy
and smoky he could see the lighted front
of the saloon from there as he crouched
there he heard the far-away wail of a loco-
motive whistle the train was coming-and
some sort of a trap was set
		exciting

  again the long station whistle wailed and
a moment later the powerful headlight of the
big locomotive bathed the depot and tracks
with light tombstone had leaped to the plat-
form and in against the wall of the depot
shielding himself from the rays from the
engine he did not see anybody

  the big limited ground to a stop at the
depot lights gleaming from every coach it
only stopped for a moment then went on
slowly gaining momentum a single figure
came through the depot-a man carrying a
heavy valise he halted looking toward the
lighted saloon as though expecting someone
the train was gone now its tail-lights bob-
bing up the track

  out from the shadow of the depot came
another man walking swiftly he went up
to the man with the valise tombstone was
fifty feet away he didnt see exactly what
happened but the man cried out there was a
sudden movement of the two men and the
sound of a solid blow

  then one man went down like a pole-axed
steer and the other man had picked up the
valise backing away from the figure on the
platform then he whirled and started walk-
ing fast

  tombstone leaped off the platform and
yelled at the man

  hold it pardner

  the man with the valise whirled and
shot at tombstone but the bullet went high
smacking into the depot wall from down to-
ward the saloon came a strident yell

  look out our horses are gone

  the man shot once more in tombstones
direction turned and started to run tomb-
stone braced against the high platform fired
once twice he was shooting by instinct in-
stead of taking deliberate aim because of
the darkness the man stumbled fell to his
knees but got up and went on leaving the
valise on the ground he was running
drunkenly

  from down at the saloon came the thud
of a shot one man was running to intercept
the man tombstone was after tombstone
slowed

  are yuh all right the man panted
wheres the valise

  tombstone couldnt hear the reply but
he saw the man fall again and the one who
had intercepted him swearing bitterly came
toward tombstone who dropped flat the
fellow shot once and the gravel drilled holes
in tombstones big hat but tombstone fired
once and the man yelped painfully went to
his knees and tried to crawl away

  youll stay hitched my friend panted

western

tombstone and went running down the
street

  guns were flashing down there too a man
was trying to untie a horse at the hitchrack
as tombstone came running

  cuss em they got our horses he blurted
im pullin out better get a horse while the
gettin is good

  yeah panted tombstone and dived into
the man

 they went down almost under rio
boggs horse which busted its tie rope and
went out of there in a hurry tombstone
didnt waste any time in trying to subdue the
man he swung the barrel of his six-shooter
in a short arc and the man collapsed

  there goes my horse yelled rio boggs
them sons-of-guns

  what the devil is it all about sam
wailed the bartender all of them were out
on the sidewalk

 dont ask me snapped the sheriff
when misery pulled that gun i got him
blast his old hide he was wearin smokys
gun and that fool andy wells-tryin to
make a pass at me with a gun ill betcha
hes through makin gun plays at officers
dont ask me why they done it im just
as    oh-oh whos this

it was tombstone jones dusty panting
stepping into the light from the saloon
windows

  i might have knowed hed be around
rio blurted jones you blasted-

 shut up rio snapped the sheriff
whats the trouble tombstone

  i dont know admitted tombstone fool-
ishly i shot two men and gun-patted an-
other how many you got sam

  i got two replied the sheriff and i

 four men shot and one with a busted
head and nobody knows why they done it
howled rio

  shut up rio advised zeke well find

  wheres smoky and speedy asked the
sheriff

  i aint shore sam but i think i can find
em now cmon

  the four of them went up toward the depot
where they found the two men tombstone
had downed one man didnt need a doctor
the sheriff lighted a match and looked at
him

  ed ferris he blurted why-why ill
be darned why eds with the silver queen
mine whos the other one

 the other one was tom sneed owner of
the short cut



the broken fork alive but unable to navi-
gate he glared at them and cursed bitterly

 tombstone what happened asked the
sheriff pleadingly

  theres another one over here replied
tombstone but ferris was the one who hit
him that started the trouble this feller
got off the train and ferris jumped him
they found the man crumpled on the plat-
form he had been hit quite hard and his
head was bleeding

  i never seen him in my life before de-
clared the sheriff what a mess why did
ferris hit him tombstone howd you get

over the head and put me in here what hap-
pened-all that shootin

  i got hooked at the depot wailed smoky
thought it was speedy and it was a man
with a shotgun lordy am i glad to see yuh
sam where on earth did you come from
how many did you get tombstone
asked speedy not waiting for any answers
or did they get away-as i expected
they didnt said tombstone with great
finality

 didnt they get the money asked
graves huskily rubbing his sore jaw
what money asked the sheriff

this is a holdup gents get out and give
me that rig-or your lives

 the red mask had the drop on the fellows in the buckboard all right-
 but just at that moment tombstone jones and speedy smith came along
 and saw what was happening

 holdup snorted tombstone can yuh imagine that

 as if these words were a signal guns flamed in the cowtown street
 there was a rapid confusing battle and when it was over the red mask
 had disappeared and the buckboard and its riders were in an inextricable
 tangle and tombstone ws sitting up on the ground holding his head
 in both hands

 i dunno where i got it said tombstone but i feel like he blowed my legs right from under
 me ruint for life-an- me right in m prime

 he got to his feet and speedy reminded him you aint lost no legs youre standin up
 maybe its m head considered tombstone

 a man was shot in the street shouted someone in the crowd

 im the man that was shot insisted tombstone

 investigation proved that the heel of tombstones right boot had been shot out from under him-
 and no other damage done and thats the kind of luck tombstone has in coyote luck for
 tombstone-one of the most entertaining yarns w c tuttle has ever written this rollicking
 novelet is in the next issue-look forward to it	

into the battle what in the devil does it all
mean two men try to gun me why

  i never was no good on answers replied
tombstone it just seemed to work out that
way

  yore awful dumb said rio do you go
around killin folks and dont know why

 it-it kinda looks thataway rio lemme
think oh yeah cmon

  tombstone started at a dog-trot and the
others followed him he led them straight to
the tool house where he opened the door
in that small room were speedy smoky and
a man named frank graves one of the
officials at the silver queen all three were
well-tied and gagged

  tombstone held matches while the sheriff
released the three men none of them had
been injured but they were all plenty mad
speedy was the first to get his vocal cords in
action

  blasted thieves he blurted they hit me

 the pay-roll of the silvpr queen i came
 here to meet the man who was bringing it
 they caught me and put me here they were
 going to take it away from him where is
 it

 the sheriff turned to tombstone did
 you see any money

 money wait a minute by golly ill
 bet-

 tombstone was running toward the depot
 how much money graves the sheriff
 said

 over sixty thousand in currency thats
 all sheriff

 sixty thousand exclaimed rio

 and ed ferris knew it was cornin here
 said the sheriff

 ed ferris queried graves why ed
 ferris sheriff

 terris knocked down the man with a
 valise graves but ferris is dead

 why the dirty crook gasped graves


he tried to steal it
yuh cant blame

exciting western

tombstone came back lugging the
valise and they took it to the depot it
was intact full of currency the sheriff
turned it over to graves

  if anybody gets credit for this its tomb-
stone jones graves he said

   am sure that the silver queen will not
forget mr jones said graves

  they took tom sneed down to the saloon
he was badly hurt but also profuse in his
profanity when accused of attempted rob-
bery

didnt do anybody any good for misery miller
to ride down here he only piled the dead-
wood on yore outfit for stealin rio boggs

when murderous outlaw foes leave him tor dead on the plains
pony express rider alamo paige returns as an avenging spook

twilight was closing down over the
green wyoming hills the setting sun
a red ball hung suspended as if hesi-
tating for a moment even the insects had
stopped humming and the night birds had
not as yet started their nocturnal calls

 all of life seemed inanimate except for
the lean chestnut racer which carried alamo
paige and the pony express mail horse and
rider skimmed swiftly along the crest of a
hill dipped down a gentle slope which led
to the crossing on green river and were

hidden by the tall lush grass which grew on
the margins of the peaceful stream

  alamo paige was a little man but a mighty
warrior he weighed a hundred and twenty
pounds with full equipment but he had the
wide shoulders and powerful arms of a
middleweight paige was the ace of the pony
express riders who carried the mail for
russell waddell and majors the mfiil al-
ways went through

  alamo paige crouched low across the neck
of his fast horse as a feeling of uneasiness




exciting western

swept over him it wasnt fear paige feared
nothing that he could see this was some-
thing different as though unseen eyes were
watching him or perhaps a portent of im-
pending disaster

  the lean racer stretched out and put on a
renewed burst of speed as they swept
through a low grass-grown swale then the
horse tripped

  the racing animal went down as though
its legs had been cut from under it by a
mighty blade alamo paige was hurled
through the air and his head struck a small
tree for a moment he was stunned

  as the chestnut racer rolled over and
came to its feet a man rose up from the
bushes and snatched off the mochila the
leather blanket bearing the mail the horse
jerked loose and ran way the man ducked
out of sight just as the sun sank behind the
distant horizon in the west insects began to
hum and the night birds began to call in
muted tones

 alamo paige still lay motionless where he
had fallen a rope whisked out of the brush
and snared one of his very small boots then
a horse appeared and dragged the pony ex-
press rider roughly into the clear as two
men stepped out of the heavy bracken

  alamo paige was not wholly unconscious
but his brain was foggy from the terrific
fall he was not sure that he heard voices
in the hazy distance and he did not see the
tall thin man who drew a heavy pistol as
he stepped forward the pistol swung down
viciously to club alamo paige on the head
and the fading light vanished as the pony
express rider lost consciousness

fl m uickly the second man drew a bowie
knife from a scabbard on the left side
of his belt he lunged down at the uncon-
scious jockey in the gathering gloom and
the tip of his blade was stained with crim-
son as he withdrew the razor-honed knife
and plunged it in the grass-roots to clean it

  throw that loop off his boot bowie the
tall man growled at the knife-wielder tod
is coiling his twine and i see he has that
mochilas alamo paige has carried his last
batch of mail for the pony express

  bowie crane threw off the noose and
tod lampson rode up with the flat mail
blanket over his right arm he grinned at
the tall man whose bald yellowing head was
like a skull in the semi-darkness

  better get on your horse jay turner
the roper said quietly we all had a grudge
to settle with alamo paige now his pards
can plant him down along the river if they

find him lets head for the hideout

    

  alamo paige groaned and opened his eyes
for a moment he remained quiet as he tried
to get his bearings he grimaced wryly as
memory concerning what had happened came
back to him

  now it was pitch dark only the early stars
studded the sky here and there paige re-
membered the stumbling fall of his racing
horse and his own flight through the thick
bracken he also remembered the distant
voices and the blow on the head which had
knocked him unconscious

  a pain in his left shoulder sent his fingers
exploring under his heavy buckskin shirt j
and a little murmur escaped from his tight 
lips as he withdrew a heavy folded piece of
white silk nat duncans wife had told him
to get the cloth in order to make him a new j
shirt

  paige knew that the folded cloth had saved
his life as he felt the tattered cloth which
was moist with his own blood only the point
of the knife had pierced his skin to make a
clean shallow wound though the blow on
the head had glanced off it had rendered
him unconscious for awhile paige smiled
grimly he told himself he had been hurt
worse many a time

  the jockey rider ignored his injuries and
he went about the task of reading sign he
crawled up the trail where it passed between
two cottonwood trees he knew that a rope
had been tied between the trees just about
ankle-high the rope was gone but paige
found the scars on one of the trees where
the hemp had cut deeply into the green bark

  paige leaned back against the tree until a
wave of dizziness had passed he could see
a faint shimmer about fifty yards away where
green river lapped at the grassy banks he
crawled down to the river bank and doused
his head beneath the clear cool water and
the dizziness passed soon his strength began
to return

  a horse snorted off to the right and alamo
paige made out the outline of the chestnut
thoroughbred talking softly paige made his
way through the grass and found the bridle-
reins caught in a dead tree near the water

  easy hoss paige whispered as his big
hands stroked the quivering racer then
those oversized hands of his passed down
the slim front legs as he spoke felt the rope-
bums where the taut rope had tripped fhe
running horse and alamo paige growled
deep in his throat
ghost

 texas-born alamo paige had been well
taught in plainscraft he could read sign an
ordinary man might have missed it was
difficult for him not to forget his oath as a
pony express rider now as he reconstructed
what had happened he had promised not to
use intoxicating liquors or to use profanity
also to guard the mail with his life

 the evidence was plain his horse had
been tripped and he had been roped by the
right boot he remembered that much and
he knew that he had been clubbed with a
gun the slight wound in his left side com-
pleted his chain of evidence

  them three he whispered hoarsely tod
lampson did the rope work jay turner
belted me with his hand-gun and bowie
crane knifed me they thought i was dead
the bushwhackin thieves

paige knew that only the heavy folded
silk had saved him from death at the
hands of bowie crane the mochilas was
missing from the light racing saddle now it
was becoming clear to alamo paige

  one of the packets in the mail pouch con-
tained ten thousand dollars in cash cal
fowler was buying the powder rim ranch
and the owner had demanded cash paige
was positive about the identity of his attack-
ers and then he remembered something else

  a hunting trip had taken him back into the
river reaches of the powder rim ranch and
he had stayed overnight in a line camp hid-
den among a cropping of granite he hadnt
thought much about that camp until he had
seen jay turner and bowie crane riding
along a high ridgejust after a stage hold-up
they were wanted in california for robbery
and murder but there wasnt much law along
the wild frontier the line camp would be
the natural hideout for the wanted outlaws

  paige tightened his saddle and drank deep-
ly of the river water strength had re-
turned to his wiry frame and the mail had
to go through his groping fingers touched
his empty holster but paige grunted softly
and retraced his steps to the trail where his
horse had stumbled

  paige went to his hands and knees and be-
gan to search through the bracken where he
had regained consciousness a little hiss es-
caped from his lips as his groping fingers
touched his dragoon cap-and-ball pistol
and a while later he found his issue knife
where it had fallen from the sheath

 pony express riders were picked because
of their small size and enormous strength
they had pledged themselves to guard the
mail with their lives neither summer

rider	

droughts nor winter storms could stop the
mail from going through and if the mail was
lost for any reason the fighting jockeys had
always recovered it

  paige straightened up and studied the
star-studded sky he would not have to read
sign to follow the trail of the three outlaws
and he muttered grimly below his breath

  they left me for dead the drygulching
robbers so ill just stay dead for a little
while

  silvery light from a sickle moon filtered
over the green wyoming hills as alamo paige
rode out of the river bottom on the chestnut
racer his hair was plastered close to his
head from the water of green river

  now he was in the foothills leading back to
the low mountains toward the norjh sage
brush and mesquite dotted the arid plains
and among the rubble of rocks there grew an
abundance of an air plant resembling a cab-
bage

  paige stopped his horse in a nest of rocks
and dismounted he had discovered where
the indians got the white pigment with which
they daubed their bodies for their ceremonial
dances the under-side of the leaves of the
cabbage-like plant were heavily coated with
a white substance resembling heavy talcum

  the jockey rider plucked leaves and
rubbed the undersides on his face and hands
he also rubbed some of the sticky powder
on the chestnut racer and he grinned in the
pale moonlight as the chestnut began to look
like a ghost-horse

  a vine was growing from the rocks where
it had obtained moisture from some source
alamo paige picked a cow melon and covered
it with the sticky white substance a plan
had formed in his fertile brain-a plan which
might work-that is for a dead man

    

  pale light from the waning sickle moon
threw a glow over the badlands which
marked the southern boundary of the powder
rim ranch alamo paige had seen a few
range cattle near the water holes and now
he judged the time to be an hour after mid-
night

  he was riding through a stand of creosote
brush when his attention was attracted to a
blotch of dark color his breathing quick-
ened when he rode over and found the
mochilas where the robbers had discarded
it of the four pockets on the leather blanket
only one had been slashed open with a knife
the one which had contained the ten thou-
sand dollars for cal fowler


exciting western

alamo paige placed the mail blanket
on his saddle and gripped it with his
muscular legs it felt natural to snug the
mochilas against the light saddle but he had
promised to deliver all the mail

  again paige was riding through the rubble
of the badlands under the eerie fading light
at last he stopped and tied the thoroughbred
to a springy branch in a stand of mesquite
where the beans were plentiful he did not
want to risk a warning if his horse should
whicker at the horses of the outlaws it was
perhaps a quarter of a mile to the line camp
where paige was sure the robbers were
hiding

  there they would be safe from marauding
indians because the old cabin was said to be
haunted by the spirit of a crazy white man
who had been murdered for a treasure of
gold he had brought from the mining camps
of california alamo paige smiled grimly as
he remembered that a crazy person was safe
from the savage indians but civilized white
men were different

  alamo paige was wearing a pair of moc-
casins he had been taking to a friend in
laramie his feet made no sound among the
sandy rubble and he moved with all the
stealth of an indian as he worked his way up
through a brush-choked draw a trail had
been worn through the brush alamo paige
followed it to a pole corral where several
horses were penned

  now he worked slowly as a horse snorted
the animal had caught his scent but when
the horses placed that scent as the smell of
a white man they would quiet down paige
moved up slowly a foot at a time then he
was at the bars whispering softly under his
breath to soothe the curious horses

  he found the sliding bars and worked them
carefully along the rails the three horses
would find the opening and wander out after
he had left

  alamo paige crouched in the brush as he
studied the line cabin silhouetted against the
eastern sky not a sound came from the little
house and paige worked his way up closer
and hid behind a nest of circling rocks near
a water hole

 he picked up a chunk of granite and
weighed it in his right hand he drew back
his right arm threw the chunk into the
corral and the three horses snorted and
raced around the pen then they were
through the opening with a clatter of hoofs
and paige heard a muffled shout from the
line cabin

  git out there and see whats wrong with
them cay uses tod

  alamo paige crept closer with his issue
knife in his right hand the back door
opened and tom lampson walked into the
yard swinging his catch-rope

 alamo paige had propped up the cow
melon on a rock near the water hole and he
threw a small pebble in the direction of the
melon which was daubed with the sticky
white powder

  tod lampson turned his head to trace the
fall of the pebble then he grunted and his
right arm went back for a throw his noose
hissed through the air but alamo paige was
already moving

 now paige was behind the roper he
leaped like a tree cat with his left forearm
coming up under lampsons chin then the
issue knife rose and fell in the pale moon-
light and tod lampson grunted as he sagged
to the hard-packed ground

  alamo paige was gone into the brush like
a startled deer he could hear the shuffle of
boots in the moonlight and again he moved
the white cow melon so that it faced the back
door a low moan came from the lips of the
pony express rider as he crouched in the
dense brush

  i want my gold paige quavered in a
high-pitched voice

  the shuffling boots became quiet inside
the cabin silence for a moment and then a
hoarse voice whispered through the gloom

  must be the ghost of that old prospector
lets pull out of these badlands turner

  i dont believe in ghosts paige heard
jay turner mutter once more the pony
express rider began to moan softly

  its a ghost sure enough he heard bowie
crane exclaim oh look yonder jay

  alamo paige knew that crane had seen the
ghostly cow melon then the still air was
shattered by a pistol shot and the melon
wobbled on the high rock a second shot
sent the melon tumbling to the ground and
after the echoes of the shots had died away
there was a deep silence

  well yore ghost is gone he heard jay
turner boast and once more alamo paige
began to moan

  yuh cant nohow kill a ghost he heard
bowie crane say hoarsely i hear it kickin
up a fuss out yonder

     ow alamo paige decided upon a daring
move he stretched up out of the
brush took a few steps in the ghostly moon-
light and then made a sudden dive into the
brush and made himself thin but instead of
staying where he was he crawled through the
brush like a snake and came around on the
ghost

  other side of the cabin

   a shot blasted out at the place where he
 had showed himself then he heard bowie
 crane whisper in a shaky voice

   did you see what i saw jay

   yuh mean yuh saw it too

   it looked like that runty pony express
 jockey crane whispered hoarsely only
 it was all white

   shucks jay turner sneered but there
 was no conviction in his voice alamo paige
 was shore dead all over when we left him
 down by green river they never come
 back

   lookee out yonder alamo heard crane
 say tod lampson aint a-movin

   get out there and give him a hand jay
 turner ordered like as not he tripped over
 his own feet and hit his head again a chunk
 who me crane blurted uh-uh
 his voice grew sullen mebbe them ghosts
 never come back but i dont want no truck
 with either one of them

   alamo paige hugged the ground and lis-
 tened he heard the click of metal which
 told him that jay turner had thumbed back
 the hammer of his gun then turner spoke
 in a curious high-pitched voice

   get on out there bowie drag tod in here
  and after we slop him down with a bucket of
  water mebbe he can tell us something ill
  cover yuh with my gun but ill blow yore
  brains out if yuh dont do what i say

   alamo paige drew his issue knife and
 palmed the keen blade in his right hand he
 waited behind the circle of rocks which
 were also screened by dense brush at last
 he heard the shuffle of a heavy boot and the
 sullen complaining voice of bowie crane

   youre the boss turner crane muttered
i know yuhre plumb good with that pistol
but it would be different if yuh only had a
 knife

   it is different turner growled you
 make a pass at me with that knife and ill
 blow yuh out from under yore hat

   im goin crane muttered and paige saw
  a bulky form appear in the cabin door he
  also saw the sheen of the long-bladed bowie
  in cranes beefy fist and the pony express
  rider twitched with the memory of his wound
  from that terrible blade

bowie crane came out into the yard in a
crouch he circled slightly to the left which
took him out of the hne of fire from jay
i turners gun he avoided being sky-lined
 against the dark horizon as he cautiously ap-
proached the body of tod lampson

   alamo paige moaned softly as he watched
 through slitled eyes bowie crane had knifed

rider	

him while he was unconscious-had left him
for dead beside the river

  crane stopped and turned his big head
his battered hat was tugged low over his
piggish eyes the heavy knife was held for
a throw as he crouched in a listening attitude

  paige groaned again and stretched up until
his head appeared above the green brush he
saw bowie crane stiffen and he could hear
the big outlaws startled grunt

 that jocky ghost crane muttered
hoarsely and his right arm went back for
a deadly toss

  alamo paige shifted swiftly to the side and
his right arm swept out to hurl the issue knife
like a silvered shaft the blade struck crane
in the left breast just as the bowie knife left
his hand and alamo paige shuddered when
the knife quivered from the bole of a small
sapling

  bowie crane was swaying like a stricken
tree which has been hit by lightning he
lost his balance tripped forward to measure
his length and his outstretched hands almost
touched tod lampson

  alamo paige hunkered down on the heels
of his moccasins to wait silence for a mo-
ment after which bowie cranes boots be-
gan to rattle a tattoo on the hard ground
then the hoarse whispering voice of jay
turner came from the line cabin

  dont try no tricks with that knife crane
drag lampson back in here and quit that
shakin like a skeleton

alamo paige smiled without mirth as
he muffled his mouth against the sleeve
of his hunting shirt a low wavering moan
drifted through the still night air growing
louder as paige withdrew his arm from his
mouth and dying away to a whisper of
sound as he again muffled his voice

  paige did not see jay turner appear at
the door but he heard the outlaws startled
gasp which told him that turner had dis-
covered bowie crane on the ground near tod
lampson then turners voice whispered
through the hazy gloom

  bowie you all right

  alamo paige began to groan softly with
his head turned away he wondered if tur-
ner would venture into the yard and the
pony express rider loosened the cap-and-
ball pistol in its skin scabbard once he
thought he saw a shadow on the floor near
the door but he could not risk a shot to make
sure jay turner was a dead shot with a
colt and if his two partners were dead there
would be that much more loot for himself

  alamo paige again smiled coldly a man


exciting western

on foot was at a disadvantage on the plains
where he would be easy prey for the nomadic
indian tribes the three horses had
stampeded and it would require another
horse to catch them

  you bowie jay turner called again but
now his voice had a nervous rasp in it
answer me or ill make a ghost out of you

  alamo paige knew that the outlaws nerves
were on edge he also knew that turner
would have to shift far to the right to see the
sprawling form of bowie crane and paige
watched the bottom of the open doorway on
that side

  he could hear a dragging sound inside
the cabin and then all was still suddenly
a pistol roared savagely and burst into flame
almost at floor level and alamo paige saw
the body of bowie crane twitch convulsively
under the impact of the heavy slug

  him and tod lampson must have tried
to kill each other paige heard turner mut-
ter me i dont take no stock in ghosts
alamo paige turned his head and groaned
softly then he muffled his voice and spoke
haltingly

  i want the mail got to deliver the
mail

  he could almost feel the silence which
pressed down after his startling announce-
ment would he have to wait for daylight
and then keep jay turner forted up inside
the line cabin until the outlaws grub ran
out

  alamo paige shrugged and dismissed that
thought he had eaten a hearty supper be-
fore leaving green river crossing with the
mail and the outlaw would at least have
some supplies in the cabin a hail from the
cabin caused paige to jerk up his battered
head

  hey ghost which one are you

  paige decided that if he had his druthers
he might as well have the odds on his side
but it was a funny question for a man who
did not believe in ghosts now it sounded as
though turner was not sure alamo paige
muffled his mouth against the sleeve of his
buckskin shirt

  i want my gold he whispered in the
high quavering voice of an old man and then
he took a deep breath i want the pony
express mail he added in low deep tones
you cant get away from us

  i aint got the mail jay turner answered
after a pause we threw the pouch away

  i found the mochilas alamo paige an-
swered sternly one of the packets had
been opened with a knife

  alamo paige then did a strange thing he

crouched low behind his nest of rocks
fumbled on the ground until his fingers
touched the punctured cow-melon and he
picked it up gingerly the sticky white sub-
stance gleamed through the gloom like a
skull and paige found a short branch and
thrust the end through a bullet hole in the
ghostly melon

  i want my gold he wavered in the voice
of the old prospector

  as he spoke paige pushed the melon up
over the rim of the rocks a shattering roar
blasted from the open cabin door and the
melon jerked back as the heavy slug struck
it center

  alamo lowered the melon and moved to the
east then he again pushed the melon up
and over the rimrock again that shattering
roar blasted the night apart and the melon
fell to the ground in several pieces

  i want my gold alamo paige whispered
as he moved back to his former position

  yuhre dead old man turned shouted
and his voice sounded a bit more confident
i know yuhre dead on account of i shot
yuh through the head my ownself and bowie
crane drove his knife through yore heart
like he done for that runty express rider

w t pon hearing this horrible boast alamo
w-j paige felt the blood turn to ice in his
veins the tall outlaw had admitted one mur-
der and turner was also sure that alamo
paige was dead paige felt no remorse for
the two sprawling forms in the yard between
his hiding place and the line cabin they
were killers and the pony express rider was
an advocate of the survival of the fittest

  alamo paige remained silent as he thought
hard if jay turner had admitted murder
perhaps he would talk some more with his
mouth wide open at least it was worth a
try	

  what did you do with my gold paige
quavered

  he heard jay turner chuckle in the gloom
of the cabin we spent most of that cali-
fornia gold down laramie way turner
boasted i still got a poke of it hid out under
my bunk come on in and get it old man

  alamo paige listened intently but now his
nostrils were flaring with the desire for bat-
tle he had seen the old prospector occasion-
ally in laramie when old dad burns had
come to town for provisions a harmless old
man seventy years old an ancient pioneer
who rode a sway-backed old mare and who
had told many a stirring story about the wild
gold-camp of san francisco	

  alamo paige swallowed hard as memory
ghost rider



gripped him he had helped carry the plain
pine box in which old dad bums had been
laid away in what the old miner had called
his other clothes a suit of black broadcloth
grown green with age he had been killed
by a bullet between his kindly old eyes and
a deep knife wound through his stout old
heart

 the pony express rider gulped and
shrugged his square shoulders old dad was
gone and he wouldnt be needing anything
but the mail was something different the
mail must go through

 alamo paige gripped the handles of his
gfm as he stared across the gloom-shrouded
yard now a leaden finger was plucking at
the eastern sky to announce that day-break
would not be long delayed perhaps he could
find out something about the missing ten
thousand which had been consigned to cal
fowler and which had been intrusted to
the pony express for safe delivery paige
took a deep breath and spoke clearly

 alamo paige speaking turner i want
that ten thousand in currency

  what he heard the startled outlaw bark
you sound like that runty jockey in the
flesh

i am in the flesh alamo paige answered
truthfully you dont believe in ghosts
you aint him turner contradicted
fd take my swear on that not after bowie
did his work

 you cant kill a pony express rider
paige said dolefully and again his voice was
muffled i want that ten thousand dollars
for cal fowler he has to pay it over at
noon or lose the powder rim ranch

 to the devil with cal fowler the out-
law blazed back viciously thats for why
we stuck up the mail we had a safe hideout
and you was the only one who saw us back
here in these hills i should have killed yuh
the day after dad bums was planted
alamo paige decided on a last desperate
chance he slipped away through the brush
feeling confident that turner would not leave
the line cabin he headed for the mesquite
thicket where he had tied the chestnut racer

 the horse was eating beans and seemed
thoroughly rested the sticky white powder
still coated its glossy chestnut coat and
alamo paige threw off the slip-knot and
vaulted to the saddle a moment later he
was riding through the dying night in the
last faint rays of the sickle moon

 paige heard a voice as he drew near to
the line cabin jay turner was talking and
paige threw back his head and moaned he
kept out of pistol range as he circled the

cabin and rode along the rim-rock he made
no effort to avoid being sky-lined as he held
the white-coated horse to a slow walk

  a shot blasted out from the cabin but
alamo paige only shrugged he took his
little bugle from the saddle where it was
held by a bit of whang-leather the bell was
crushed and bent but alamo paige raised
the bugle to his lips and blew a blast

  another shot whistled harmlessly through
the brush below him paige reined into a
thicket slipped from the saddle and tied
the horse to a springy branch

then he crouched low and made his
stealthy way back to his hiding place
behind the circling nest of rocks which faced
the line-cabin door

 yuh cant nohow fight a ghost jay
turner screamed

  i want that ten thousand alamo paige
said softly as though he had been there all
the time

  come and get it turner screamed a
ghost couldnt have done for tod lampson
and bowie crane and yuh dont pack the grit
to face me for a shoot out

  yuh cant shoot a ghost paige answered
in a hollow voice it wouldnt be a fair
shake

  who are you turner whispered hoarsely

  mebbe fm a ghost rider but i feel like
alamo paige the answer came softly across
the clearing its coming on daylight tur-
ner the boys will be lookin for me when i
dont show up and i left a plain trail to
follow

 there was silence for a moment this
seemed to indicate that jay turner was
thinking when he spoke it was like a man
who has made a decision

  i dont take no stock in ghosts and when
i kill a man hes dead all over im coming
out and ive got that ten thousand in my
pocket

  alamo paige began to breathe deeply he
stretched to his feet keeping behind a clump
of brush he saw a vague slender shape blot
out the open doorway slowly jay turner
walked into the yard

  shoot ghost turner taunted brazenly
im clearing out of wyoming but i might as
well take what them two pards of mine have
in their clothes

  alamo paige drew his pistol and watched
the advancing outlaw jay turner was not
afraid hed give the outlaw that much tur-
ner stared curiously at bowie crane leaned
over and plucked the issue knife from the
dead mans breast
	exciting

  so it wasnt a ghost paige heard turner
mutter and now the light was getting
stronger i aint afraid of anything i can

see

  but youre jumpy paige taunted in a
whisper yuhd shoot at anything that
moves and yore gun must be running dry

  jay turner straightened up and turned
his head he was without a hat and his
bald head gleamed like a yellow skull in
the pre-dawn light his eyes were drawn
and puckered as he tried to place the spot
from which the voice came after a time
he shrugged his thin stooped shoulders

  ghost or not step out and bring me
powder smoke turner said quietly and he
holstered his grimy gun i aint never been
beat at the draw up to now

  alamo paige stared his unbelief then he
realized that the killer was taking his only
chance jay turner had nothing to lose but
his life which was already forfeited if the
outlaw won this gamble with death he could
ride out of wyoming a free man with money
in his pocket

  money that had been intrusted to the pony
express mail which alamo paige had
pledged himself to deliver at the risk of his
own life

  alamo paige pouched his pistol and
straightened his shoulders promptly he
stepped from the brush into the clearing he
heard a startled gasp from the stiff lips of
the tall slender killer

  alamo paige and you are a ghost

  paige had forgotten about the white pow-
der on his battered face now he was facing
the man who had killed old dad burns and
had robbed the pony express

  im not a ghost turner paige contra-
dicted but his voice sounded tired im
alamo paige in the flesh

  yuhre a ghost turner repeated and
his tongue made a peculiar rasping sound
as he licked his dry lips then the outlaw

western

straightened his sagging shoulders me i
dont believe in ghosts he spoke like a
man who tries to assure himself

  i want that ten thousand alamo paige
said slowly the mail must go through

  if it does it will be carried by a ghost
rider turner vowed savagely im cornin
at yuh smokin

promptly turner went into swift
action as his lips hissed the deathly
warning his right hand stabbed for the
gun in his holster but alamo paige also
struck with the suddenness of a deadly ratt-
ler his hand flicked down and up with
scarcely a pause and the dragoon pistol
roared like a cannon as he touched off his
powder

  jay turner jerked bck under the impact
of the ball and his finger pressed trigger to
send a futile shot into the ground between
himself and the ghostly rider turner swayed
forward buckled at the knees and sagged
to the ground like a limp buckskin shirt
his scarred boots rattled briefly and came
to rest

  alamo paige staggered from weariness as
he paced forward stiff-legged like a dog on
the fight he stirred the body of turner with
a moccasinec foot reached down and felt
inside the hunting shirt and found a
crumpled envelope the envelope had been
opened but the stiff paper currency was in-
tact paige stuffed the letter in his pocket
and slowly shook his head

  mebbe old dad bums will take his rest
now paige murmured and then he climbed
the sloping trail to the brush pocket where
he had left his horse he grinned as he
mounted the saddle on the white-coated
horse

  the mail must go through alamo paige
said with a little smile tugging at the cor-
ners of his hard mouth even if it has to
be carried by the ghost rider

the walls rocked with the sound of their guns and sterling smelled the sharp pungent smell of gunpowder

the quills of tebo sterling

by allan k echols

  it took a lowly porcupine to prove to young tebo of the
  fast gun and hot temper that neighbors are good people

when he saw the man come into
the saloon that saturday after-
noon in crosstrees tebo sterling
was certain that trouble had caught up
with him again the hot resentment which
always smouldered in him leapt into flame
he had never been able to understand why
he had been singled out so frequently as a
focal point for trouble but he had accepted
the fact and his acceptance made him short-
tempered and touchy



 it was not that the people of crosstrees
had been antagonistic but that they had
been reserved about him waiting to see
what kind of man this younger brother of
marshal pete sterling was they knew his
reputation and it was not  good one this
range had not accepted him and he knew it

  so his muscles tensed and his jaws clamped
tightly this saturday afternoon when the
man came in wiping trail dust from his red
sweaty face with a blue bandanna hand-
	exciting western

kerchief as he headed for the bar sterling
knew the man by sight and by reputation

  the stranger stood near sterling while he
ordered a beer then when his eyes became
adjusted to the shade he looked at the faces
up and down the bar and his gaze settled
finally on young sterling he spoke in an
undertone inaudible to anybody except
sterling

 howdy there fifty thousand i was
lookin for yuh

  tebo looked at him coldly the man was
squat and heavy and his wind-burned face
was not clean to look at nor were his eyes
good as they blinked back at him

 my name is sterling tebo answered
coolly i dont like the one yuh just called
me

  the man drained his beer at a gulp while
he thought that over then he wiped the
foam off his stringy mustache

  yuh dont have to git yore back up like
a danged porcupine he growled i knowed
yuh when that was yore number

  thatll be enough of that sterling
snapped we werent friends in prison and
were not friends now

  maybe not the man shrugged indiffer-
ent to the rebuff but i hear yuh got a nice
setup here with yore brother the marshal
and all remember lige boyce hes around
and him and me has got a little proposition
to make yuh

  mister sterling said in a low tight voice
move away from me right now  dont
want any part of you or boyce or any of
yore propositions

  the man drained a second glass of beer
and wiped his mouth again he did not seem
at all put out at the refusal he looked at
sterling through the backbar mirror

  thats mighty bad since i done talked
too much to yuh he said i didnt know
yuh were a white-livered skunk

tebo sterlings eyes were glued to
the backbar mirror and he saw the
mans hand sliding down toward his weapon
it was with a sense of fatalism coupled with
a cynical anger that he watched the man
taunting him into a shooting

  sterlings feet steadied themselves while
his eyes never moved he saw the sneak
draw could even now hear what the man
intended to say about shooting in self de-
fense the strangers gun came up hidden
from the crowd between his body and the
bar the muzzle rising toward sterlings
middle

  it was a dirty snide attempt at cold blood-

ed murder and sterlings restraint snapped
just in time he jerked his own gun free of
its scabbard and blew a hole through the
mans neck the man didnt even clutch at
the bar as he fell and died in the sawdust
lying on his own unfired gun

  it was the unfired gun that caused the
talk later

  while two men rushed out of the saloon
a hush fell over the others sterling looked
at them defiantly then picked up his beer
glass and finished emptying it then he
went out to find his brother not looking back
once at the dead man on the floor of the
barroom

  he found pete coming hurriedly toward
the saloon followed by the pair who had
eported the killing he met pete and drew
iim off to the edge of the wooden sidewalk

 pete was nearing forty big boned and
lean and with a aura of nervous hurry
about him which often expressed itself in
impatience

  whats the trouble he demanded

 tebo told him what had happened not
defensively but as a simple statement of
fact

  he had his gun out for a sneak shot
but i saw it and beat him to it it was
either him or me he finished

  pete scratched his chin

  but i dont understand why hed try to
kill yuh just because yuh wouldnt have any-
thin to do with him

  i know hes a hombre they called coyote
collins back in prison he bragged that
hed never got a dollar in his life except at
the point of a gun and never intended to
from what he said i figger he and lige
boyce whos worse had somethin planned
to pull around here and wanted me in on it
on account of you bein marshal probably
figgered you and me was workin some devil-
try of some kind then when i wouldnt
come in on it he wanted to shut my mouth
before i got a chance to tip yuh off about it

  pete thought a minute then looked at
his younger brother searchingly

  that could be of course he admitted
sure yuh hadnt had trouble back in
prison

  tebo felt his gorge rising

  i told yuh didnt i that id never had
any dealins with him before are yuh
doubtin my word

  pete started toward the saloon

 all right come on and dont be so
touchy thats whats wrong with yuh too
all-fired touchy

  they went back to the saloon and now
the quills of

the ranchers were gathered in a group which
suddenly became silent when the brothers
walked in pete sent a man for the doctor
then addressed the crowd in general
what happened

  there was no response pete scratched
his chin then changed his question
perkins what happened

  a silver-haired rancher sitting at one of
the tables looked uncomfortable

  well-to tell you the truth pete i didnt
see anythin till i heard the shot he an-
swered reluctantly then i seen that hom-
bre fall thats all i know

  did anybody see this stranger draw a
gun

  nobody had

 anybody hear any argument

 again nobody knew anything and tebo
felt anger rising in him toward his brother

  pete he said sharply i told yuh exact-
ly what happened the man was sneakin
his gun out hid between him and the bar
these gents wouldnt have noticed it because
he didnt want them to if yuh think im
lyin then lock me up

  perkins spoke up pete i dont think
any of us would be in a position to dispute
whatever yore brother says happened

 tebo saw what the man meant the
ranchers did not know that the stranger had
drawn his gun first but on account of pete
whom they respected they were not accus-
ing his brother of a deliberate killing they
were throwing it directly into petes lap
while they kept their own ideas to them-
selves and tebo had no illusions about
what those ideas were

                                  

pete made his decision quickly but he
gave tebo a long speculative look be-
fore he announced it

  yore story aint denied by anybody he
said carefully so ill take yore word for
it but id be a little slower to take offense
if i was you a man that shoots as fast a
gun as you do has to be extra careful

  then he turned and walked out

 tebos face burned with anger as he
watched his brother go he resented the
humiliation of being dressed down by pete
in the presence of these ranchers   

  although his own homestead was separated
only by the section line from that belonging
to pete tebo sterling did not see his brother
for ten days he purposely avoided him
because he was still angry

  he felt that petes asking the others in
the saloon about the shooting constituted
proof that pete doubted him and this hurt

tebo sterling	

him even more than the fact that now since
the shooting he saw a new coolness toward
him from everybody even the owner of
the general store while being polite was
pointedly impersonal neighboring ranchers
spoke stiffly when he passed them

  he was out back of his new pond putting
up some cross fencing when he next saw
him pete rode up his horse sweating and
he did not dismount

  now yuh got a chance to do some good
with that fast gun of yores he said bob
perkins whole herd of hereford yearlins
was stolen last night were formin the
posse at rock springs get yore gun and get
there as quick as yuh can hurry up
petes voice was sharp with authority
and with his natural tension it struck tebo
as a command and being still angry he
resented it

  im busy he answered he picked up
his post hole diggers and started another
hole

  but im tellin yuh pete answered
after a moment of surprise they stole
perkins herd we got to get em

  bitterly tebo remembered the white-
haired rancher refusing to voice anything
he knew about the shooting less than two
weeks before he remembered perkins for-
mal nod when they had passed each other
on the road less than a week ago perkins
was just like the rest of them looking out
for himself alone

  yuhre the law aint yuh he asked
well its yore job to catch the rustlers
pete sat his horse straight his fist on his
thigh and silently looked long at the youth
digging the hole finally he spoke

  yuh know that perkins is a neighbor
of yores dont yuh

  what if he is tebo returned angrily
i dont owe him anythin i got my work
to do same as he has

  after another uncomfortable silence pete
spoke again

  yuh know who stole that stuff dont
yuh if yuh had played that collins hombre
along and found out what they had up
their sleeves then told me this wouldnt
have happened the signs are that this is
the work of yore friend boyce and his gang
he waited for the impact of this to hit
tebo it hit with a blow that made his rage
boil over

  if yuhre tryin to connect me with boyce
yuhve got a job on yore hands he said
angrily i told yuh before that i never
had nothin to do with them men now go
on about yore marshalin and let me alone
	exciting western

will yuh

  pete dropped off his horse easily and stood
 facing tebo

  listen here you he snapped ive
done everythin for yuh i can but- cant
and dont even want to cover yuh if yuhre
mixed up with any of those crooks yuh
might have been telling the truth the other
night but im an officer of the law and i
wouldnt be doin my duty to my neighbors
if i passed up a killin without gettin all the
facts particularly if it was a brother of
mine thats got a reputation of bein a sour
itchy-fingered gun hand

  tebo hit him on the jaw with a sudden
surge of rage that knocked pete backward
into the dust as he fell petes gun slid
out of holster and fell a few feet away pete
rolled over instantly got up and stepped
toward his gun then he stopped he looked
strangely at tebo who stood unarmed his
fists still doubled up

  then pete turned his back on his brother
 picked up his gun and holstered it he said
 nothing as he mounted and rode away

tebo leaned on his post hole diggers
and watched the retreating form and
the feelings in him were so mixed that he did
not himself know why he felt like he did
he slammed the diggers down into the half
finished hole and stalked up to his cabin
disgusted with the whole world

  he could not remember of ever having
felt any other way since his early youth

  his step-father and petes had been an
old squatter who had spent his life blaming
more effective men for his own lack of
success and he had taken out his disappoint-
ment on the boys raised hungry both of
them had early learned to look out for them-
selves

  they had asked nothing of anybody and
tebo had no intention of taking any more
rough treament from the world

  his quick temper had got him two years
in prison when he had shot too quickly in
an argument the other man hadnt even
got his gun free of its holster he came back
more bitter than ever and with petes help
had homesteaded near him and now in this
last affair even pete seemed to be turning
against him
just as he picked up his diggers his yel-
low hound came tearing out of the postoak
woods down past the bam and ran yelping
up to him with three porcupine quills
dangling from his nose he caught the dog
to yank the quills out but the dog cried
and tried to pull away

  whats the matter he snapped im
 just tryin to help yuh come here yuh
 hammer-headed fool

  he caught the hound and held the ani-
 mals neck between his legs while he ex-
 tracted the quills the dog howled and tried
 to snap at him and when the quills were
 out he ran and crawled whimpering under
 the cabin

   now aint you smart he said to the cry-
 ing animal yuh go interferin in a porcu-
 pines business an he gives yuh just what
 yuh deserve an then yuh try to bite back
 at somebody thats tryin to help yuh outa
 yore own foolishness

  he hitched up his team and drove down
 to the creek to cut more posts his dog fol-
 lowed him and while he was cutting the
 dog again found the porcupine and set up
 a campaign of barking tebo found the ani-
 mals and watched them a few moments
 contemptuous of the actions of both

   he spoke to the dog

   yuh had warnin he said and if yuh
 aint got sense enough to let that critter
 alone yuh can pick the quills outa yore own
 nose after this that porky aint no good for
 anythin anyway either to himself or any-
 body else

   he went on with his post cutting and took
 a load of them back to the fencing job around
 his pond something was worrying him but
 he did not know what it was

   he had started digging post holes again
 when a rider came fogging the dust up the
 road and pulled into his place tebo had
 never seen him before

  mind if i water my animal here he
 asked i been kinda pushin him

   help yoreself sterling answered look-
 ing at the sweated animal looks like yuh
 been in a race

   i have the man answered im headed
 for town to try to round up some more posse-
 raen before that boyce skunk kills every
 decent rancher in the valley hes already
 killed three men and wounded the marshal
 and if we dont get him hes gonna keep
 on killin

  the marshal tebo repeated whats
 the matter they cant get this boyce hom-
 bre

   boyce and his partner is holed up in a
 rock cave up in the hills and they cant get
 him out without losin a lot of good men
 the marshal tried it after somebody in the
 posse hinted he was coverin his worthless
 brother that knowed them rustlers back in
 the pen somewhere

   tebo sterling felt the blood surge to his
the quills of tebo sterling	

face and he was on the point of slugging
the man when it dawned on him that this
man could not have known who he was and
that the man could only have been repeating
what he had heard from others

  aint there anybody up there can out-
shoot this boyce

  the man snorted decent ranchers aint
generally fancy gun hands they say there
aint but one man in the country that could
outshoot boyce and thats the marshals
brother and he may even be mixed up with
boyce anyway they say hes so unneigh-
borly hed see his neighbors stole blind before
hed raise a hand to help its a dirty shame
it sure is tebo snapped wheres
this boyce holed up

  six miles east on this road and about
a half a mile north halfway up a hill with
three big pines on the peak you wantin
to join in they can use all the neighbors
that will help

  yeah tebo said i might ride out and
try to give em a hand

 good the man answered pulling his
horse out of the edge of the pond tell
em im gone after more men

riding toward the hill of the three
pines tebo sterling rode with an
easier mind than he had ever known in his
life it was true that he was worried about
how badly pete was wounded but this was
not great as compared with the heavier
thing which had rolled off his shoulders when
he had suddenly seen the answer to his prob-
lem

 he knew now why there had been so
little satisfaction in his life why he had
gotten into so much trouble and why even
the men who should have called him neigh-
bor had distrusted him

 he had seen himself out in the woods
when he had looked at the porcupine when
he had seen this animal whose defenses
had made him so touchy that he was of no
use to himself or the world and whose
neighbors if they had any intelligence at all
left him strictly alone

 tebo sterling had demanded that the
world leave him strictly alone and it had
all except thrse who had been reckless
enough to foe with him and who had had
to pay for it even pete was paying for
being his brother paying with his reputa-
tion

  it was clear now and tebo rode up into
the hills eagerly

 the first man he saw as he dismounted
halfway up the hill where the sound of occa-

sional shots could clearly be heard was old
silver-haired perkins perkins looked at him
suspiciously from where he lay on his belly
a rifle propped over a protective sandstone
boulder the old man spat in the dust
tebo saw it and winced

  tebo dropped down beside the old rancher
just as a bullet whined and chipped the
rock

  wheres pete he asked and how is
he

  perkins kept his eyes on a cave entrance
high above him

  hes not hurt bad but bleedin too much
to move till a doctor patches him he re-
plied what do yuh want here

  i thought maybe i could help tebo
answered im not too bad with a gun

  yeah i know perkins spoke cryptically
i reckon well make out though we
wouldnt want to put yuh to any trouble

  listen here mr perkins tebo said
ive been a fool for a mighty long time
havin my back up an thinkin i wasnt
beholden to nobody just today it came to
me how wrong i was it aint easy to say
but id be mighty proud if my neighbors
gave me a chance to try to make it up to
em

  old perkins stared open-mouthed at him
until a bullet made him duck his head

  no he said finally i reckon a thing
like that wouldnt be easy to say petes
over behind that big round boulder i reckon
hed be mighty glad to know yuhre here
take care them buzzards is mighty straight
with a rifle

  tebo skittered between rocks until he
found pete lying back of a big outcrop
stripped to the waist and with his shirt torn
into bandages for his bloody chest

  look pete he said dropping to his
knees just take it easy ill go get boyce
for yuh yuh were right i been on the
wrong track now hows the best way to
get up there to them coyotes i dont know
this hill

  pete gazed at him a moment his first sus-
picious look turning gradually to belief and
then his face breaking into a broad grin
he saw the truth in tebos face and what he
saw made him glad

  bueno feller he said we can use
yuh but heres the situation that pair
picked them a spot and dynamite cant dis-
lodge em theres no way up to the mouth
of the cave without exposin us to their
rifles we just got to have so many men
they cant kill us all then rush em with
them protected and us exposed it aint
	exciting western

gonna be pretty

  thats kinda hard on the ranchers aint
it tebo asked speculatively

  it is pete admitted but its always
that way some good men have to die so that
the rest can live in peace its tough but
thats the way it is

  yeah tebo answered absently

  he was looking up the steep hillside a
tilted jumble of sandstone boulders and
brush scrub oak and cedars running upward
toward a towering rock wall of gigantic
boulders these great boulders stood on
edge like a massive row of curbstones and
they seemed purposely arranged there to
hold back the mountains summit from tum-
bling into the valley below

pete looked up too then turned a
thoughtful glance to his brother

  yuh can probably find something to do
to help he said after all yuh aint been
what yuh might call neighbors with the
rest of em so they wouldnt be expectin
yuh to take too much risk on their account
sure tebo answered absently but if
i was considerin bein a neighbor- he
broke off suddenly say is there a trail
that leads around that wall

  yeah but yuhd have to let yoreself
down to the ledge boyces cave is on with
a rope and yuhd be a sittin duck while
yuh was slidin down the rope i figgered
on that before but its sure death

  got a rope on yore saddle tebo asked
getting to his feet

  every man here brought his lariat-just
in case we caught em

  ill be back shortly tebo said 

  he found a lariat on the first horse he
located then spent a good half hour finding
the upward trail and working his way around
to the wall containing the cave he was
sweating and out of breath when he stopped
at the point he had aimed for and he sat
down and rested

  he was on the cap of one of the upturned
sandstone slabs which formed one side of
the cave entrance a sheer drop of twenty
feet below him would terminate on the ledge
in front of the cave mouth where boyce
and his partner lay behind a smaller rock
safely picking off every rancher who made
the mistake of exposing himself to their
accurate fire

not far overhead half a dozen buzzards
sailed ominously on the updrafts of air ris-
ing on still wings wheeling and settling
rising again-waiting patiently hungrily
tebo breathed deeply of the good air and

his eyes swept the miles of green and yellow
checkered valley below him followed the
winding ribbon of green woods along the
streams of clear cool water which ran down
from the hills he saw the herds dotting
the meadows black angus herefords and
polled shorthorns there were clumps of
buildings and outbuihirtgs painted white
and here and there windmill pointed its
steel fingers up toward the fleecy clouds

  it was a good country a land a man could
dig his feet into a land that a man could
call home and could love but it was a
land a man also had to swear allegiance to
a land stronger than one man where neigh-
bors had to join their strength to subdue it
and earn the right to call it home and
frequently they had to buy it with their
blood

  and now for the first time tebo sterling
saw these things and he did not think the
price too great

  he picked up the lariat looped one end
of it to the base of a twisted pine and
dropped the other end of it over the sand-
stone wall so that its lower end hung
dangling in front of the mouth of boyces
cave-knowing full well that it would be
seen gripping it ten feet from its anchor-
age he dropped over the ledge

  he was not wrong the cattle thieves
saw it and acted with speed boyces part-
ner came out of the cave to pick the intruder
off his swinging perch he looked upward
then raised his rifle

  tebo sterling saw the square ugly face
below him just as the slack in the rope
tautened with a jerk leaving him swinging a
full ten feet above the mans head the man
was taking aim expecting sterling to slide
smoothly down the rest of the distance a
sitting duck for an easy shot

  sterling fooled him he turned loose the
rope and dropped the remaining distance
to the ledge he landed rolling and would
have fallen the fifty feet from the ledge to
the next lower outcrop of rock if he had
not grabbed the mans leg as he rolled near
him

  the man braced himself and his finger
contracted on the trigger of his rifle the
gun roared and lead sent chips of stone fly-
ing into sterlings eyes sterling held his
grip on the mans leg his own feet dangling
over the cliff he hoisted himself up and
rolled back onto the ledge just as the man
freed his leg and aimed his rifle again

  sterling rolled toward the man clawing
at his own gun knowing that he did not
have time to get it into action in time he
the quills of

could only bump against the mans shins as
the man triggered he felt a burning pain
go through one of his legs but he had
thrown the mans aim off enough to give
him another moment of life and time to get
his gun out

 the man lost his head having missed
twice he clubbed his gun and tried to beat
sterlings brains out with the stock the
walnut butt of the rifle thudded against ster-
lings head and jolted him to his very toes
it left him dizzy and half blinded

sterling tried to get to his feet pull-
ing himself up on the leg of the rene-
gade who was desperately fighting him off
his wounded leg felt paper weak and when

tebo sterling



the man shoved him backward the leg gave
way and he was down again

  the man backed off to give himself room
and raised his rifle deliberately intent in
finishing his job this time

  sterling aimed his gun now through eyes
that wouldnt focus and pulled the trigger
just as the weight of the third slug sent him
rolling toward the lip of the ledge

  his foot caught in a gnarled pine sapling
and he saved himself the mans rifle had
dribbled out of his hands and his knees
were buckling when he fell he hit the
rim of the ledge and his body hurtled feet
over head down onto the rocks below

  at the sound of a foot disturbing a stone

sterling looked back at the cave mouth in
time to see boyce himself with his rifle
coming to his shoulder and the face behind
it contorted into a cold killing rage

  sterling whipped his gun around and his
lucky shot blew the winchester out of
boyces hand and slammed it back into the
cave then sterling seized the moment to
try to get to his feet again

  he managed to get up but the wound in
his leg had sapped its strength and he could
stand only by leaning against the stone
wall of the cave entrance his face was
bloody from the chips of stone buried under
the skin and his head felt like a great mass
of pulp from the rifle blows he could not
stand nor could he bring his eyes to focus
on the blurred figure of the man in front
of him

  but he knew that the man was backing
away clearing leather with his hand gun
and talking at the same time the words
drifted to him as from a great distance

  yuhre tebo sterling you and me done
time together feller boyce said there
aint no use in us fightin i could make
things pretty soft for yuh around here if
yuhd only git some sense there aint no
use in us shootin it out when we could
work together now is there

  dont talk-shoot if yuhre goin to
sterling snapped there aint room for both
of us here on my range my range i said
so shoot or throw down yore gun

  yuh cant even see me boyce countered
persuasively yuhre dead on yore feet
already i could kill yuh the first shot but
im givin yuh a choice-

  i named my choice sterling answered
desperately trying to see through the fog
that clouded his eyes we people in this
valley dont make any compromise with the
likes of you mights well drop yore gun
boyce theyll get yuh sooner or later any-
way

  yuhre a fool boyce said and while he
spoke the muscles in his finger tightened on
the trigger of his pistol

  tebo sterling felt the blow of the slug
tear through him felt himself flung viciously
against the cavern wall he was down and
he knew he would stay down this time

  the image of lige boyce was vague indis-
tinct and the gun was heavy in tebo ster-
lings hand but there was a kind of exultation
in his heart and it was only this exultation
that kept him alive his gun would not
staad steady as he aimed it at the crouching
advancing boyce but he triggered the
weapon with a kind of wild joy that drove

out all consciousness of pain

  the walls rocked with the roar of their
guns and the sharp smell of gunpowder
was pungent in his nose it was a good
smell the dim figure of boyce came un-
steadily toward him and presently it was
squarely above him in the echo of their
guns final explosions tebo sterling saw
the form toppling just above him

  then lige boyce fell squarely on sterling 
and the fall of the man knocked the last
vestige of consciousness from sterlings tor- 
tured body and a black oblivion swept
over him he lay under the body of boyce
the trace of a smile lifting one corner of
his mouth and complete repose smoothing
the muscles of his face   

it was the pain caused by the jolting of
an old studebaker wagon bed without
springs that brought him back to conscious-
ness he was a mass of aches and pains
from the bruise on his head to the wound
in his leg

  he heard the creaking of the rolling wagon
wheels and the clink of the harness and
he heard the thumping of many hoofs
neighbors were driving the herd which they
had recovered for perkins

  he tried to raise his head and look around
he saw the vague forms of bodies up in the
wagon bed under the drivers seat all cov-
ered with tarpaulins

  then he looked beside him and pete was
lying there grinning back at him

  i win pete said i had a bet that seven
bullet holes wasnt enough to kill yuh yuh
sure picked yoreself a stage to put on yore
act half the ranchers in this county sat
back on their haunches and watched the
bloodiest fight this county ever saw boy
yuhre a marked man yuhll be gettin all
my pistol business im afraid

  i dont want any of it tebo replied
grinning back unless some other coyotes
like them come in and try to disturb the
peace of my range

  old perkins pulled his horse up along-
side the creaking wagon and he had a smile
for tebo that was better than a weeks rest
son he said i never cottoned to a
man that was too handy with a gun before
but after what you done well its kinda
comfortin to know i got a neighbor to de-
pend on in a tight

  tebo sterling felt something in his throat
that interfered with his swallowing yet he
managed to speak thanks neighbor

  then he closed his eyes and his wounds
didnt mean much to him right then

had a word

josi it

by chuck stanley

many a calf had gone through the
branding chute and a good many
money beeves were on the way
to the slaughter houses in kansas city and
chicago before the old moss-back and the
young greenhorn were able to settle down
and relax one with his brown and scarred
pipe and the other with a chewed pencil stub
and his notebook for the discussion of
bronc-riders of ranch and rodeo

  one thing youve got to bear in mind
began the maverick is the fact that a
bronc-buster was right proud of his pro-
fession he was a king pin in the bucking-
and-busting business and everyone on a
ranch recognized that there were almost
as many words for a bronc-buster as there
are for a ranch cook and thats something
because since cowboys first started chasing
muleys most of them have been trying to
think up names to call the ranch cook

  the pilgrim was well aware of this and
several dozen of the more familiar and print-
able names for the cookie had gone into his
records in the case of the buster he dis-
covered that they were just as readily known
as rough-string riders bronc-twisters
bronc-snappers bronc-peelers jinete
flash-riders bull-bats and bronc-
squeezers

the contract-buster

  most big ranches had one or two bronc-
busters on the payroll pointed out the old-
timer but the smaller ones usually took
the services of a contract-buster as the
name indicates he was the sort of a rough-
rider who would come around regularly
and agree to break a certain number of
broncs at a fixed price you dont have to
debate the fact that a bronc-buster had
plenty of nerve and raw courage he literally
wasnt afraid of man or beast he proved
that to any man who disagreed with him
and he didnt have to prove it to the horse

because most cayuses like any other animal
know when a man is afraid of them and the
first time this happens theres no contest
the horse will always bust the man

  the pilgrim nodded soberly and the
mossy-horn went on to tell his willing
pupil that a bronc-rider never mounted a
horse he always topped him forked
him stepped-across the kak or hair-
pinned the hull

  before he did this the saddling operation
was usually in the hands of a hazer whose
job it was to blind the bucker with a bur-
lap bag or a cloth where no cloths were
handy the hazer frequently eared down
the bronc which consisted of holding the
horse with his head to the ground by grip-
ping both ears

  the waddy doing the saddle-mounting
job never described it in just those terms
he put the wood on screwed down the
kak or laced up the tree

  once these preliminaries were completed
and the buster was aboard and with a rein
or a halter rope in his hands he had a color-
ful group of phrases for cutting loose from
the hazers and saddlers

  he might tell them simply to shoot or
he might ask to have the animal turned
loose thrown off or let go

  most good bronc-busters paid most of
their attention to the horse under them but
they couldnt all ignore the advice of the
peelers or rannies on the top-rail opera
house of the corral or in a rodeo arena
these westerners invariably suggested that
the bronc-squeezer cinch her when she
bucks bust her wide open rake her with
the hooks tickle her feet rise to the
trot and scratch her

two types of bronc busters

  there have always been two schools of
bronc-busters declared the old-timer
some of them figured that the only way to

our tenderfoot discusses ranch and rodeo riders


exciting western



break a horse was to literally break its
spirit these came to be known as horse-
breakers the other school was the one
known as gentlers they figured and it was
the wise way too that a horse might have a
mind and spirit of its own and that a high-
spirited animal might prove a valuable serv-
ant as long as it realized that man was the

boss this type of bronc-scratcher is by far
the most numerous today

  the lingo of the rider when he is in the
rodeo arena is tied up to some extent with
the rules set down for competition riding
the old-timer went on to explain a cowboy
in such a contest is disqualified or loses
points when his foot comes out of the stirrup
when he changes hands on the rein or loses
his rein if he is bucked off or fails to scratch
the mount he also loses out if he wraps the
reins around his hand grabs any part of
the saddle with his hands or strikes the
horse with his hat or his hand

our pilgrim is ambitious

  this information was interesting to the
pilgrim since he was always seeing the
ranchs bronc-peelers working out with the
regular stock and preparing for the local
rodeos in which they frequently took part
he also had hopes of being able to engage
in this activity himself

  he discovered that scratching was the
cowboys description of the kicking motion
of the spurs or boot-heels while riding a
bucking horse in competition some cowboys
also described this as raking

  a good raker was able to roll his spur
rowels from shoulder to rump and could
count on a high point score for this accom-
plishment in rodeo competition

  coasting on the spurs was one way of
losing plenty of points it was a good way
to keep from falling off the horse however
since the rider who coasted was mounted
with his spurs hooked into the cinch or under
the horses shoulder blades some of the
boys who didnt go in for coasting did use
a variation known as screwing down the
spurs which consisted of setting the spurs
in the cinch and not moving them at all

  most contestants didnt try to use these
subterfuges however preferring to bicycle
which was the method of scratching with
one foot then the other as though he were
pedalling the old two-wheeler other boys
curried him out when they picked a tough

  bronc and this consisted of raking with the
spurs some horses were reefed or
combed with the heel-irons

  a cowboy who did more than the average
spurring was described as throwing the
steel or throwing the hooks and the
marks left on the unwilling hide of his animal
were known as hundred-and-elevens

  there are any number of times in actual
range-bronc-busting and in the competi-
tions when a rider used no spurs at all this
was more frequently seen in the ranch break-
ing corrals here the gentler felt that a
spur might make his job more difficult rather
than simplify it such riders were known as
slick-heels and they were therefore said
to be riding slick-heeled or merely rid-
ing slick

  the boys who spent all of their bronc-
busting days on the ranch were described
as riding the range while those who left
home frequently for the rodeo circuit were
said to be riding the shows

  once a cowboy managed to get into his
saddle and set his spurs for the ride there
was a colorful group of phrases that ex-

plained how his riding appealed to his cow-
hand companions invariably his severest
critics first of these was the expression
riding safe which indicated that the wad-
dy was well down in his saddle had his legs
well gripped against the horses sides and
his spurs hooked into the cinch

  a rider who followed the popular eastern
style of posting was said to be seeing day-
light each time he left his seat with the
jump of his horse

close to the plaster

  some safe riders were also spoken of as
sitting close to the plaster using a close
seat r hooked to his horse naturally
the more accomplished bronc-peelers
scorned anything of this kind knowing that
such riding didnt bring them any local fame
or attract attention in the big time rodeo
contests

  they preferred to be seen riding straight
up which meant that they were erect in
the saddle gripping the reins in one hand
and holding the other one straight up in the
air this was also described as riding with
a slick saddle in other words without any
help from a saddle roll hobbled stirrups
or grabbing the nubbin
the cowboy had a word for it



the saddle roll

whats a saddle roll interrupted the

tenderfoot

  the old-timer laughed then replied

  some folks may think its something like
a parker house roll or one of them stirrup
cups the eastern dudes drink out of before
they start out on a fox hunt but its nothing
like that a saddle roll was a gadget cooked
up by some bronc riders to get an advantage
over a tough horse when range-breaking
him these waddies couldnt sit a horse with
the seat of their pants and the pinch of their
knees so they took a roll of blankets and
tied it across the saddle just behind the
horn this wedged the rider down in the
saddle and he had to be pried loose to fall
out

  the pilgrim joined the maverick in his
laughing and decided that such a cowboy
must be a really cautious hombre unless his
horse was actually a tough one the discus-
sion continued and the arbuckle discov-
ered that these rolls were also known as
bucking rolls

  on the range the description of the work
of the bronc-peeler had almost as many
names as the bronc-twister himself when
in action the bronc-buster was said to be
taking the kinks out topping him off
setting his hair kicking the frost out
smoothing the humps out uncorking
him working him over unroostering
and ironing him out the last expression
was frequently employed when spurs or
other sexious means were used in the opera-
tion

the cowboy didnt always win

 naturally the cowboy wasnt always the
victor in these competitions with unbroken or
half-broken cayuses and the winchells and
woollcotts of the west had their own colorful
dialogue for describing the downfall of their
busting brethren

  a horse in the process of sending his rider
through the air was described as unloading
the buster turning loose the pack or

  sending him to join the bird gang

  equally descriptive word pictures were
drawn of the discomfited ranny who was
busting the breeze in a fashion he had

seldom anticipated he was said to be
dumped landed chucked or spilled
frequently this explanation of his plight
was made more colorful when he happened
to land on his face and scraped his nose
along the ground for a bit such an unfor-
tunate was said to be chewing gravel
grass-hunting eating dirt kissing the
ground or biting the dust

  naturally we all know that in indian-
fighting days biting the dust had a much
more serious meaning to the average west-
erner

  when a cowboy flew through the air with
the greatest of ease and didnt necessarily
scrape up the ground with his nose he was
frequently described as landing on his som-
brero or his j b or his stetson or said
to be sunning his moccasins

  the top-flight bronc-busters who succeed-
ed in keeping their grip on the mount until
he was gentled in the ranch corral or un-
til the signal at a rodeo was rewarded in
numerous oral descriptions

  sometimes he was spoken of as riding
him out then again he stayed in his tree
or stayed in the kak or gripped the

the horses one of these was known as
thumbing this was the practice of jabbing
the animal with the thumb to make him act
up bronc-busting was another type of
western activity in which the texans dif-
fered from their neighbors in other states as
to lingo a texans horse never bucks
he always pitches

  on the range there were a number of col-
orful bits of dialogue that do not crop up in
the rodeo arena but they are an important
part of the language of the western horse-
man

 frequently when cowboys were on a
roundup or a trail drive the safety of a herd
at night depended upon the waddies getting
into their saddles in a hurry and heading
for the bed-ground when a cowboy start-
ed toward his animal whether he happened
to be at a hitch-rack in a corral or on a rope
picket line he was said to be making for
his horse

 if he mounted the animal on the run he
was spoken of as taking a run the old-
timer explained that many people think that
taking a run means the act of riding par-
ticularly at a trot canter or gallop but it is
simply the business of climbing aboard a
horse while the animal or the man is in mo-
tion when the cowboy hit his saddle with-
out benefit of stirrups the action was known
as a flying mount

 this was also called a running mount
and in a rodeo or wild west show was fre-
quently featured as a pony express mount

them consarned longhorns

by tex mumford

them danged dogies could do some awful suange things-them old texas longhorns that built the west
from sod hut to pre-fabricated silo they have been replaced on the ranges by such fancy-sounding critters
as durhams herefords and polled anguses of course the new blue-ribbon stuff has to be fenced in and
fed up on-soy-bean cereal to make bigger and better steak but if it comes to walking you need a good old
longhorn and the old-time steer sure had a lot of footwork to do

    the drovers never could figure out what would happen on the market drives a story is told about a
herd that woke up every single night at eleven oclock sharp and went on the stampede-just like sleep-walk-
ers there was no way of curing the critters

    and theres another true yarn about a herd of longhorns that was sold time and time again by the same
man not long after this herd was taken off on the trail by the buyer they all stampeded home again and mixed
up with the range stock

    one trail outfit got its herd well trained to follow the chuck wagon on the drive north to wyoming
when the boys reached the oregon trail they were in trouble every time a wagon passed the herd got to
following it

    sometimes the longhorns would be spooked at the roost insignificant items and refuse to budge a step a
barbed wire fence with the sun glinting on it would halt the hull caboodle and there they would stand for
days sun rippling on water would halt a herd on the banks of a river and nothing would make the critters
cross until they made up their mind a plowed furrow would turn an entire herd aside and start it going in
the wrong direction and they just wouldnt cross a railroad track

    but of all the things that puzzled a longhorn more than any other that was the sight of a cowboy on foot
according to longhorn intelligence that puncher just had to be growed with a horse under him

  frequently it was necessary for a cowboy
to ride his horse up steep bluffs or down the
sides of ravines in order to locate missing
cattle such actions were described as
scratching gravel if the horsebacker was
merely out for the ride or taking a casual
jaunt into town his fellows spoke of him as
jiggling or racking

  the pilgrim entered this information in
his notebook and stood with pencil poised

but when the old-timer knocked the grey
dottle out of his browned corn-cob pipe and
began to replace it in the leather pocket of
his brush jacket he knew that the latest ses-
sion of the frontier lingo school was about to
be adjourned for the night he thanked the
mossy-back for his help the old-timer
smiled happily and said

  thats okay mister youre a good lis-
tener and weve still got a heap of palavering
to do before youre a cow-country webster
for sure

  with his comment the oddly-assorted cou-
ple broke up to meet with us some time later

jikfcoai horseshoe bit the barrel of the colt

the sheriff rings a killer

 by jackson cole

    when sheriff sam judson has his lucky horseshoe in his
    shirt its time for tough hombres to be plumb careful

it was quiet and warm out in back of
the small adobe building that was
the rocky gulch jail but not too warm
for the game of barnyard golf that was
going on however sheriff sam judsons
shirt was wet with perspiration as he picked
a horseshoe to toss he was a tall man and
fat and this game he was playing with his
deputy added up to quite a bit of exercise
for a hot day

  how do we stand now lefty judson
asked the deputy he was standing behind
the steel stake that had been driven into the
ground aiming at another stake just like it
sixty feet away six-four aint it

  thats right sheriff lefty doyle nodded
yuh made one ringer-that gave yuh five
points-then yuh got a closest which gave
yuh one more point i made a leaner and a
closest which brought me four



  like i thought said the sheriff nodding
slowly and deliberately he tossed the
horseshoe it went sailing through the air
dropped it hit the post with a clang of metal
against metal whirled around then slid to
the bottom of the stake

  ringer doyle shouted shucks sam
it just dont look like ill ever be able to beat
you nohow

  that was my third toss said judson
complacently yore turn lefty

  he stepped back as the deputy moved to
the stake holding three horseshoes in his
right hand-naturally doyle was called
lefty for the obvious reason that he was
left-handed taking one of the horseshoes
in that left hand he made his throw the
horseshoe landed about a foot to the left
of the far stake

 hey-you can do bettern that the
	exciting

sheriff called encouragingly you aint half

tryin

  doyle a lean raw-boned middle-aged man
didnt say anything but there was a look
of concentration on his rugged face as he
got ready for a second toss he had just
lifted the horseshoe when out on the street
on the other side of the jail came gunshots-
two of them spaced close together it was
a loud startling sound in the hot silence
doyle spat out a curse and dropped the
two horseshoes to the ground for an instant
he stood poised ready to leap with action

  trouble exclaimed the sheriff and we
aint even wearin our guns

they were good lawmen and far from
fools so they didnt go running out into
the street unarmed instead they headed
on the run for the back door of the jail
raced through it and pounded on to the
sheriffs office in the front of the building
yanking their gun-belts from wall pegs they
buckled them on

  folks gatherin across the street called
judson as he glanced out an open window
looks like trouble at the bank lefty

  holdup mebbe barked the deputy

  but sheriff judson was already through
the door and heading across the dusty street
moving fast and light-footedly for a fat man
deputy doyle was close behind him as they
reached a small group of men in front of
the rocky gulch bank

  they were all facing a husky young fellow
in range clothes and two of them were
covering him with guns judson knew the
young fellow-buck warren a cowman
who owned a small-spread over east of the
town

 whats happened here demanded the
sheriff as he drew up short

  why warren here tried to rob the bank
thats what shouted one of the men with
guns his name was dan marvin and he
was one of the biggest ranchers thereabouts
he shot and killed frank harper the
teller sheriff and was just gettin away
when i stopped him outside the door

  thats a lie warren said coldly sheriff
judson when i went into the bank the first
thing i saw as the teller on the floor with a
bag of money beside him i grabbed up the
bag and lit out to find you didnt seem
right to leave that dinero for just anybody
to pick up i ran into marvin at the door
and he fired two shots at me without askin
me any questions reckon i was lucky he
missed

  the lawman nodded it had always been

western

his policy to figure a man innocent until
proved guilty but he had to admit buck
warrens story did sound thin why would
anyone kill the teller and hightail leaving
a bag of money in plain sight

  afraid ill have to arrest yuh and hold
yuh on suspicion till this is cleared up
buck he said sorry son but thats the
way of it

  dont worry sheriff dan marvin put
in importantly this killer wont give yuh
any trouble-not while me and my foreman
got our guns on him anyhow

  judson just looked at the big square-
faced owner of the cross in a box outfit
dan marvin always had acted like he ruled
the roost around sage county just because
he owned the biggest ranch in that section
frankly sheriff judson didnt like the man
and he had no love for chet barr the little
gunslick who was marvins foreman either

 put yore gun away marvin judson
said mildly that means you too barr
up to now me and doyle been able to handle
our prisoners without help reckon we aim
to keep it that way

  scowling marvin thrust his gun back into
holster as he grunted something his fore-
man also dropped his colt into leather

  warren heaved a sigh as the sheriff walked
over to him

  i shore didnt aim to tangle with the law
he said

 judson and doyle took warren over to
the jail and locked him in a cell none of
the three said much but the sheriff was
doing a lot of thinking leaving the young
rancher without a word the fat lawman lum-
bered back to his office and sat down at his
battered desk lefty doyle dropped down
on a chair got out the makins and rolled
a quirly the deputy was the first to speak

  we heard two shots and marvin fired
em he said after a thoughtful silence
yuh reckon warren killed frank harper
with a gun that dont make any noise or a
bow and arrow or something sam

  all three of em said judson

  huh doyle looked at his superior in
surprise what yuh mean

  ive been wonderin why we didnt hear
three shots just like you have lefty the
sheriff said somethin almighty strange
about that groaning he got to his feet
come on lefty we better go look over the
scene of thfe crime as the feller says

 the two lawmen went over to the bank
again by now a crowd had collected in
front of it but someone had closed and locked
the doors so no one could get inside jud-
the sheriff rings a killer	

son marched up to the door and pounded on
it

  its the sheriff he called loudly open
up

someone inside the bank unlocked the
doors and adam harper local under-
taker and coroner peered out at them his
eyes were red and his face more lugubrious
than it was naturally the two lawmen
entered swiftly and harper slammed and
locked the door in the faces of the crowd the
undertaker was a tall thin man who looked
like a living advertisement for his own busi-
ness

  im shore glad yuh got here sheriff he
said hastily this is worsen yuh thought
not only was my brother frank killed but
i just found grayson dead back in his office
grayson exclaimed the sheriff good
gravy martin grayson

  martin grayson was president and owner
of the rocky gulch bank and an important
man in that part of the country judson
hurried into the bankers private office gray-
son was lying slumped down at his desk a
bullet in his heart

  we didnt hear any four shots either
doyle remarked dryly as he stood behind
judson while they gazed at the body yuh
reckon were gettin deaf

  mebbe the sheriff shrugged but it
shore looks like its up to us to prove we aint
dumb too he frowned grantin that
buck warren did rob the bank lefty why
would he come into this private office and
shoot grayson first

  you tell me said doyle i aint much
better at riddles than i am at pitchin hoss
shoes why

  i dont know yet judson said firmly
but i shore aim to find out

 why did warren have to kill frank
asked adam harper plaintively frank was
a good bank clerk a mighty fine feller but he
wasnt a fighter he told me plenty times that
if the bank was ever held up he wouldnt
risk his life tryin to battle no bandits
and yet frank was killed said sheriff
judson theres somethin mighty strange
about this here whole thing he looked at
doyle and nodded you take charge lefty
if harper here wants to move the bodies to
the undertakin parlor see that he gets help
to do it

  even as the sheriff spoke he was gazing
thoughtfully at two half-smoked cigars in
an ash tray on the bankers desk they
looked like expensive cigars

  yuh can go out the back door sheriff

harper spoke up ill unlock it for yuh
judson nodded im goin back to the
jail lefty want to be shore somebodys
guardin the prisoner

  yuh think buck warren might try to get
away asked doyle

  not exactly the sheriff said slowly but
i figger somebody might try to take him
away

  judson left the bank by the rear door
he went around in front of the building
some of the crowd had dispersed but a small
group of men stood on the plank walk listen-
ing as dan marvin talked to them earnestly

  you all know what we do with killers in
this part of the country the sheriff heard
the owner of the cross in a box saying
we string em up to the nearest tree
thats right shouted a man in the crowd
that was fast warming up as they listened
to the ranchers harangue what are we
waitin for get a rope somebody

  i figger you gents better calm down
sheriff judson said coldly as he joined the
men in front of the bank there aint been
any lynchin while ive been sheriff-and
there aint goin to be any

 there were angry murmurs from the
crowd judson didnt like the way those men
were acting it looked as if marvin had them
really stirred up

  remember what i say the sheriff went
on grimly anybody who tries to take that
prisoner away from me and my deputy stops
lead

  he turned away and stalked back toward
the jail and his office as he passed thelocal
blacksmith shop he noticed that it was closed
and remembered seeing the blacksmith with
the mob he remembered others also and
the situation grew more ominous

  judsons mein was determined as he en-
tered his office got a pair of handcuffs and
went back to buck warrens cell the young
cowman was the only prisoner in the jail

  folks are talkin of a hangin out on the
street the sheriff told warren as he un-
locked the cell door im goin to hide yuh
somewheres else buck till things quiet
down he frowned want yuh to know
yuhre still my prisoner though so im
puttin on these handcuffs

  warren didnt protest or try to struggle
as judson snapped on the handcuffs then
the sheriff led him out of the back door of
the jail they went along the back of the
buildings until they reached the rear of the
blacksmith shop

  in here judson said as he found a back
door open want yuh to stay here till i see
	exciting western

if i can get things cleared up buck will
yuh promise me yuh wont leave

  all right sheriff warren said slowly
i promise but what if some of the mob
should find me here i wouldnt stand a
chance handcuffed unarmed and alone

the sheriff hesitated then drew his gun
and handed it to his prisoner warren
stared at the lawman in amazement as he
took the colt

  provin im trustin yuh buck judson
said soberly reckon thatll protect yuh if
theres trouble

  nodding he went out the back door and
hurried along to the rear of the jail the
sun bright and hot gleamed on the horse-
shoes that he and lefty had been pitching
when the trouble started that seemed a long
time ago to the sheriff but he figured it
hadnt been more than an hour at most

  he saw his lucky horseshoe lying at his
feet and on impulse picked it up unbottoning
his shirt he thrust the horseshoe inside
maybe it was lucky as lefty so often said
if that was so he had never needed it more
than he did now

  judson lifted his head as he heard voices
out in front of the jail he had locked the
front door when he had gone to get his
prisoner and now someone was shouting
and pounding on it

  a lynch mob all right judson muttered
tightly come to get buck and no time
now for me to get another gun

  with no further hesitation he hurried along
in back of the buildings to the undertaking
establishment and slipped through the back
door the place was deserted though the
bodies were there evidently adam harper
had gone to see what all the excitement was
at the jail

  as a thought struck judson he began a
hurried search through the desk in harpers
office to his satisfaction he found what he
was looking for-a letter addressed to adam
harper and from the dead bank president
the sheriff read it nodded grimly as he put
the letter into his pocket

  figgered it might be somethin like that
he muttered now i got to clean things up
around here

  he stepped out into the street through the
front door and stood there listening from
the blacksmith shop came the sound of
hammering on metal judson cursed

  warren probably trying to get free of the
handcuffs but the noise would attract the
blacksmith and the rest of the mob who by
now had broken into the jail and found the

prisoner missing

  the blacksmith shop a man was in-
stantly shouting as he tore down the street
with others roaring after him

  warren must be in there yelled another
thats where the sheriff hid him and hes
tryin to get free

  sheriff judson ducked back raced down
an alley and along the back of the buildings
he had to get in that blacksmith shop by
the back door before the mob poured in
from the front

  as judson reached the back door he
peered in buck warren was standing at
the anvil pounding at the chains of the hand-
cuffs with a heavy hammer he had managed
to get one wrist free

  abruptly the front door was burst opened
and dan marvin lunged in with adam har-
per and other men behind him

  got yuh warren shouted marvin
yuhre goin to hang for them killins
warren straightened up the heavy hammer
in one hand the gun in the other he
flung up the gun aiming it straight at the
owner of the cross in a box judson reached
inside his shirt and pulled out the lucky
horseshoe

  come any closer and ill shoot to kill
warren snapped

  marvin just laughed and moved forward
judsons horseshoe went flying through the
air it hit the barrel of the colt in war-
rens hand and knocked the gun up just
as it roared

  we aint goin to have any more shootin
yelled judson as he bounced forward or
any lynchin either buck warren didnt rob
the bank he didnt kill frank harper and
martin grayson and i can prove it

  go ahead sheriff marvin said weakly
he was realizing how close he had come to
being shot if judson hadnt hit warrens
gun with the horseshoe he might be headed
for boot hill right now were listenin
grayson killed frank harper judson
said soberly staring at the undertaker
frank had been stealin money from the
bank and grayson found out about it the
banker wrote a letter to franks brother
adam harper sayin he knew the teller had
been stealin bank money

  thats a lie shouted harper yuh
cant prove anything like that sheriff
oh yes i can heres the letter grayson
wrote yuh adam

  judson drew it out of his pocket over
the heads of the men he saw his deputy
lefty doyle standing in the doorway listen-
ing
the sheriff rings a killer



  yore brother must have gone loco when
he learned he was discovered harper the
sheriff said somberly reckon he tried to
get grayson and the banker killed him in
self-defense probably happened in graysons
office which has thick walls and a heavy door
not much chance of hearin a shot fired in
there outside the bank

 then who killed grayson demanded
adam harper

  you did the sheriff said sternly yuh
paid him what he must have thought was a
friendly visit right after yore brother was
killed i reckon grayson told yuh what had
happened anyway yuh both had time to
smoke half a cigar-the cigars i saw in gray-
sons office

harpers eyes were darting about
nervously

 why should i kill grayson he de-
manded

  because yuh didnt want him to tell the
truth about yore brother bein a thief ac-
cused judson yuh shot and killed grayson
in his office then yuh decided to make it
look like a bank robbery so yuh put yore
brothers body out in the bank and left a bag
of money near it

  but how would that make it look like a

bank robbery demanded marvin the
rancher

  it was supposed to look like grayson and
harper died protectin the bank explained
the sheriff and that the robbers got away
without bein seen scared off mebbe before
they could grab their loot warren was the
first customer this mornin he found frank
harpers body just like he said and was
rushin out to look for me when marvin saw
him

  looks like i made a big mistake and
near got killed doin it dan marvin said
ruefully mebbe thisll learn me not to think
a man is guilty until im plumb shore about
it

  i always figger a man is innocent-till hes
proved guilty said judson grinning at buck
warren who grinned back at him even if
i have to throw a hoss shoe at him to show
im right

  doyle strode forward and took adam har-
per a prisoner the crowd slowly drifted
away all thoughts of lynching gone from
their minds

  now we got another prisoner to take care
of till the case goes to trial said doyle
with a sigh shucks just looks like we
never will get a chance to finish that game
of hoss shoes sheriff

jury for juniper

by wayne d overholser

trial by gunsmoke was the verdict tor nesters but juniper
jim ot fox butte sure believed in fighting fire with fire

chapter i
warning

jim malone hunkered down in the
dying sunlight before his shack and
watched the approaching dot become
a horse and rider

  behind them stretched the wide flat of
jericho valley great holes of emerald show-
ing in its sagebrush covering scattered
here and there over the valley floor were

homesteaders shacks

  six months ago there had been no holes
in the sagebrush carpet and no shacks at
that time jim could have had half a section
of valley land but instead hed insisted on
settling among the junipers on top of fox
butte they laughed at him down there in
the valley just as the townsfolk in ashfork
laughed and had fastened the name juniper
jim upon him

  it had been the locator zeb crofitt who
had laughed first and had thought of the

a complete action novelet


	exciting

name juniper jim crofitt had ridden out
from ashfork with jim and had wanted to
locate him at the western end of jericho val-
ley but jim had taken a look at the long
stretch of sagebrush flat then hed looked
at fox butte and hed said that was where
he was going to live

  zeb cofitt had thrown back his head and
laughed mightily

  dont be a fool malone hed said thats
no place to dry farm youve got to haul
everything you buy in town up a long grade
and youve got a tougher job clearing the
land with them junipers on it than youd
have down here in the valley

  jims jaw had set stubbornly

  im not going to live in the valley where
im all penned in im going to build my
house on the top of the butte where i can
see something

  before you make up your mind the
locator had urged lets ride up there and
take a look

  when they had reached the top of the
butte crofitt pointed north

  now look at that malone besides the
other reasons i gave you theres another
mighty good one why youve got no business
filing on this chunk of hill down theres
dry canyon im guessing youd lose about
forty acres in rimrock and canyon bottom
that aint worth a damn mebhe less but
anyhow whats the sense of taking this
piece when theres several nice half-sections
down there in the valley

  jim malone had turned his back to dry
canyon hed stood looking out across jeri-
cho valley breathing deeply

  get a whiff of that ozone crofitt heady
just like wine this is it heres where im
going to live

  dang it malone crofitt had exploded
ive been locating settlers for years and i
never did see one as bone-headed as you
you wont listen to nothing besides all the
things ive mentioned theres one more sure
as you locate here youll tangle with orv
baileys bar o outfit and youll wind up full
of holes every fall orv sends a crew up
here to cut wood in these junipers this be-
ing the only bunch in the country and dont
think youd last long bucking the tough
hands orvs got

  ive got a winchester that shoots plumb
straight crofitt now if you want a hundred
dollars out of me youd better find my cor-
ners

  all right juniper jim crofitt had
laughed sourly go ahead be a fool
that had happened six months ago now

western

malone had his shack with a small bam
behind it he had a wagon and team hed
cleared some ground and hed dug a well
but he wouldnt get in as much of a crop as
the men in the valley would and he wasnt
so sure he was as smart as hed thought he
had the ozone and the view but a man
couldnt fill his stomach on either

  still he thought stubbornly ann would
like it up here and besides it had been a
question whether he was going to settle
where he wanted to or where zeb crofitt
wanted him to he hadnt liked crofitt and
he didnt like him now it was worth some-
thing for a man to keep his independence
and hed keep his if he starved

the rider was close enough for jim ma-
lone to see that it was slim priddy one
of baileys bar o buckaroos he stepped
inside buckled on his gun belt left his win-
chester just inside the door so it would be
handy and sat down again

  he knew priddy had the reputation of be-
ing a tough hand and hed seen him kill a
man last fall this was the first attention
malone had had from orv bailey so it wasnt
likely priddy meant to make trouble still
and all it was just as well to be ready jim
didnt have any illusions about being a tough
hand but he didnt aim to be anybodys
pushover either

  priddy reined up in front of malones shack
  howdy

  howdy jim said get down and rest
your saddle slim

  nope im just up here to deliver a mes-
sage for orv been all the way through the
valley and id be on my way home if you
hadnt got it into your noggin to settle way
up here id like to know why

  theres a view malone said ann liked
views but a tough hand of slim priddys
caliber wouldnt know about what a girl like
ann would want

  a view priddy turned in his saddle and
looked back over the valley then he looked
down at malone and shook his head mebbe
youre loco like they say what good does
a view do aint you here to dry farm you
cant raise no wheat in a view

  no depth of understanding malone saw
just a hardcase who could pitch five slugs out
of a six-gun in a short time and fatal fashion

  now i reckon youre right malone
agreed but besides the view theres the
ozone

  ozone priddy cuffed back his sweat-
stained stetson and scratched his head nev-
er ate any
jury for juniper	

  you dont eat it malone explained you
breathe it

  now look priddy said in exasperation
mebbe i aint full of big words like you are
but theres one sure thing that even an ig-
norant cuss like me knows you dont breathe
nothing but air and brother thefes lots of
it around here

  right malone agreed heartily lots
of it thats what ozone is air pure and
refreshing air

  oh priddy thought that over for a time
then he laughed and his eyes malone saw
were light blue and his lean hard-lined face
wasnt nearly aswicked as it had been the
day hed gunned the man in town now that
youve made a fool out of me i aint sure
youre as big a fool as the folks in the valley
say you are might be something to this view
and ozone business anyhow you dont look
all tired out from grubbing sagebrush and
having kids like them valley grangers look
climb down and have a drink malone
said i see that i misjudged you slim
i could have talked all winter to those folks
in the valley and i never would have made
them see as much as you have here in five
minutes

  slim priddy climbed down without a third
invitation and took a long pull on the bottle
jim handed him

  aside from this view and ozone business
malone he asked why did you land up
here

  ive got a girl jim said back in idaho
i heard about this country that was settling
up and i said to ann that this was the last
chance wed have id been riding for an
outfit for three years slim and i wasnt get-
ting anywhere so i pulled stakes and came
out anns a girl such as you never saw she
likes things like views and ozone i aim to
raise a crop of kids and some wheat but im
going to do it where the kids can see out past
the end of their pug noses he rubbed his
own nose anns got the cutest pug nose
you ever saw slim her eyes are blue a
mite darker than yours and her hairs real
yellow

  so you were a cowhand before you got
clod-busting ideas priddy said thought-
fully i thought you was different than
them square-heads in the valley

  malone only half heard the long evening
shadows were across the valley now and the
distant hills were red with the transient
touch of the sunlight he was broke flat
broke and he was remembering how hed
stood with his arms around anns slim body

that morning last fall before hed got on the
stage

  just a year honey hed said ill get a
place going and a home that youll be proud
of well have something where we can put
our roots down and live a lifetime a years
all ill need

  a year ann had whispered it will
be a long year

hed kissed her and her eyes had been
closed as if storing the memory of that
last kiss then shed opened her eyes and
winked at him and kept on kissing him now
he was broke he had enough grub to last a
week perhaps two if he cut down on the
prunes for dessert he wouldnt get much
crop in hed wind up by selling his team
and wagon and going back to idaho to ride
for his thirty a month and beans

  i was going to bring her out here slim
malone said shed like the view and the
ozone

  well why dont you slim asked envi-
ously if i had a girl i wouldnt be fooling
around youre wasting the best years of
your life jim you ought to get started rais-
ing that crop of kids

  im broke malone said flatly plumb
broke maybe i wasnt as smart as i figured
the view and the ozone dont fill a mans
belly and i sure couldnt get a loan on it in
town

  hmmm slim said thoughtfully i never
thought id say this to a clodbuster but im
gonna do it anyhow ill loan you a couple
hundred which same is all ive got that
oughtta give you a hand go ahead and send
for that girl

  two hundred dollars malones eyes wid-
ended that would give him a hand all right
and maybe he wouldnt have to wait the year
out then slims face hardened and he began
to swear

  i reckon its the ozone jim the buckaroo
said i plumb forgot what i came up here
for orv bailey sent me around to tell the
grangers theyd better vamose if they didnt
want trouble

  we havent hurt bailey malone said
why is he warning us to get out

  did you ever see a cowman who wanted
a bunch of grangers moving in on his range
slim demanded besides you got him where
it really hurt when you filed on this juniper
patch for years hes got his wood and posts
and such from this butte

  malones jaw set stubbornly

  he can still get his wood and posts up
here if he wants to pay for them
exciting western



  which same mebbe jibll do orv aint no
trouble-maker fact is hell go a long way
to keep out of trouble but he figgers hes
getting tromped on he says hell turn some
cattle in here on your grain if you dont
vamose

  reckon i wont have much grain to worry
about malone said bitterly

  slim had swung back into the saddle

  that loan offer i made still sticks he said
reluctantly but orv would skin me if he
heard about it reckon im something of a
fool myself but i kind o like the cut of your
jib the only thing is orvs plumb stubborn
when he gets his mind set if he really gets
it into his head to move you off hell get you
one way or the other

 slim nodded and rode back down the
butte malone watched him disappear into
the dusk thinking that sometimes tough
hands werent always as tough as their repu-
tations but hed seen enough of orv bailey
to know that what slim had said about him
was true anyhow jim was thinking it
didnt make much difference if a man
starved out on a homestead there wouldnt
be much fight left in him and there wasnt
much to fight for

  then an idea hit malone slim had said
orv bailey would turn his cattle into jericho
valley and none of the homesteaders had
built any fence partly because theyd been
too busy clearing the sagebrush from their
land and partly because they hadnt seen the
immediate need of fences now theyd see
the need theyd want fence posts and theyd
want them quick thats where juniper jim
malone would come in hed furnish them
with fence posts and it should prove almost
as profitable as a gold mine

chapter h

you pay cash in ashfork

t took jim malone
most of the next day to
talk to the settlers in
jericho valley by late
afternoon the job was
done and he drove his
team into ashfork with
a feeling of warm satis-
faction in him there
wouldnt be much wheat
raised on fox butte but
he wouldnt be starving
out and that was the
main thing hed harvest his crop of juniper
and by fall hed have money to jingle in his

pocket if he had any luck at all hed be
sending for ann before the year was out

  you bet were not letting orv bailey run
us out of jericho valley the settlers had
said we heard what slim priddy had to
say but were sticking you get those posts
to us and well build some fence thatll keep
bar o cattle out o our grain then if bailey
wants to start cutting wire well see if he
wants to burn some powder too

  fox butte wasnt going to be such a bad
place to make a home after all malone was
thinking and as he drove past zeb crofitts
office he wondered what the little locator
would think when he heard how much cash
money the posts would be worth then as he
pulled up in front of matt royces mercan-
tile tied and moved around the pole to the
boardwalk he found himself facing crofitt
i was out to see you this afternoon crof-
itt said in an aggrieved tone you wasnt
around anyplace

  in the six months since jim malone had
settled on fox butte he had learned that
zeb crofitt was a good deal more than a
land locator he sold real estate he loaned
money and in one way or another he seemed
to control most of the things that went on in
ashfork he had a huge cigar tucked into
one comer of his wide thin-lipped mouth
his black eyes were narrowed as he pinned
them on malone and there was about him the
air of a man who expects obedience and who
still resented jims refusal to take his advice
when he had insisted on taking fox butte for
his homestead

  i was away malone said and started to
move around crofitt

  ive been wanting to see you the locator
said quickly and stepped in front of the
homesteader you were a blamed fool last
fall but im sure you see now why i told
you to settle in the valley therell be a lot
of grain raised down there and those men
will be fixed for next year what are you
going to live on juniper jim

  juniper berries malone said testily

  i dont see any reason to get funny
crofitt snapped im trying to do you a
favor when i was up there this afternoon
you had just about as much land cleared as
i thought youd have there are still a few
good spots in the valley ill buy a relin-
quishment and then ill locate you free in
the valley ill give you two hundred dol-
lars

  not interested malone said and again
tried to step around the locator

  i dont know why the devil i should try
to help out a stubborn bone-headed jasper
jury for juniper	

like you crofitt said in exasperation ex-
cept that i want this country to grow and
weve got to have settlers who can make a
living ill give you five hundred and ill
send a man out to help you move your stuff
look crofitt malone took the locator
firmly by the shoulders and lifted him to
one side ill explain this in simple terms
i dont want to move i like fox butte i
want to go into the store then he released
his grip on crofitt and went on into matt
royces mercantile

  royce was a big man easy-going and slow
of thought and speech jim malone had never
asked him for credit but he knew royce
had put some of the settlers on his books
jim ordered a sack of flour a side of bacon
and a dozen cans of peaches

  im getting so blasted tired of prunes
jim said that i have to turn my head when
i eat them i cant look them in the face ill
take this stuff out to the wagon and you lay
out a crosscut saw a sledge and a couple of
wedges ill be back in a minute

  as malone walked back along the counter
he saw that zeb crofitt had come in behind
him

  you aiming to cut wood for orv bailey
crofitt asked

  no malone said and went on by

  when he came into the store again crofitt
had moved up and was looking at the saw

  i cant see what youd want this stuff for
he said if you arent aiming to cut wood
i thought id start a toothpick factory
malone said and turning his back to crofitt
said matt id like to buy this stuff on tick
ill have the money in a week or so

  royce started to nod agreement and sud-
denly as if without thought on his part fin-
ished by shaking his head he was looking
past malone at crofitt and it broke across
jims mind in that split second that royce
was getting his instructions from the locator

  sorry juniper jim royce said apolo-
getically ive gone in kind o heavy with
some of em that have families in the valley
ive got to have cash

ithout turning his head malone
spoke

  of course crofitt wouldnt think much of
my toothpick factory on account of his false
teeth youre different matt i even figured
you were more than half human which no-
body ever said about crofitt

  you can have the grub royce said re-
luctantly not looking at crofitt this other
stuff ive got to have cash for

  if you need cash juniper crofitt said

meaningly you know how you can get it
when i take cash from you for anything
malone said ill be down to eating juniper
berries royce i sure had you wrong i
thought you were a man but i reckon youre
just a puppy dog jumping to crofitts whis-
tle

  mebbe if i knew what you wanted this
stuff  royce began

  i said id have the money inside of a
week or at the most two

  i heard that but if i knew just what you
had in mind  

  its no secret jim said coldly and lean-
ing forward so that crofitt could not hear
he added in a low tone im cutting posts for
the settlers

  posts royce said in astonishment i
didnt reckon theyd have time to put in a
fence now besides i thought theyd go to
the mountains for their posts this fall
crofitt had to know before royce would
make up his mind then hed get his signal
from the locator that was the way it looked
to malone and he began to realize the power
zeb crofitt wielded in ashfork he wheeled
to face crofitt a savage anger rushing
through him

  you say im a fool for settling on fox
butte jim grated you say youre trying
to do me a favor by buying a relinquishment
i dont think you ever did a favor for any-
body that didnt make you money i think
youve got some kind of a dirty trick up your
sleeve and i want to know what it is

  that talk wont get you anywhere juni-
per royce growled youre new here
if youd been here as long as i have youd
know that zeb crofitt has done a lot for this
country

  hes advertised it malone admitted
turning back to the storekeeper and hes
located us for one hundred dollars a crack
weve moved in royce and weve made
money for you now you come up with this
hard luck yarn about how you cant afford
to let me have this stuff on tick it sure
doesnt make sense unless youre into the
same business crofitts in or unless youre
scared of him and take his orders he
looked at crofitt eyes filled with contempt
i cant see why youd be scared of him
royce i dont know why anybody would
crofitt took the tooth-battered cigar out
of his mouth

  i dont reckon anybodys scared of me
juniper sure i try to make money i reck-
on we all do but like i sad im trying to do
you a favor for one thing id like to keep
you from getting plugged by baileys gun-
	exciting

slingers likewise im against you selling
posts to the settlers because bailey wont like
it whatever we do lets avoid bloodshed
you wouldnt have a chance with hardcases
like ace ansell and yaff dulane

  malone tapped a long finger thoughtfully
on the counter a new thought had come
into his mind most of matt royces trade
had been with orv bailey over the years
it had been baileys business that had kept
royce going the settlers trade was a new
addition that might not be permanent bailey
would be here a long time too zeb crofitt
might be baileys man it was certainly pos-
sible that crofitt wanted the settlers to fail
perhaps so he could locate a new bunch or
perhaps because bailey had put pressure on
him

  i cant quite see through this jim said
finally im not as slow in the head as some
folks and when i find out a little more about
the way you operate ill know what to do
theres just one thing royce i hope some-
body comes in here and starts a new store
with zeb crofitt telling you what to do ive
got a hunch you wouldnt last long

  when malone strode past crofitt he saw
the expression of deep and man-killing ha-
tred on the locators narrow face he knew
now if he hadnt before that crofitt would
murder him when and if he had the chance

  as malone stepped through the door he
heard a mans soft voice

 keep going dont look at me watch
your step

  the briefest of side-glances showed him
slim priddy leaning against the door casing
a cigarette drooping idly from one comer of
his mouth his eyes playing lazily along the
street he was apparently a man with no
serious intent or purpose

  as malone went on to his wagon he saw
what priddy meant two men had come
through the batwings of the union bar and
were heading directly for him one a red-
faced mcaty-lipped man was ace ansell
the other medium tall with nervous cat-
quick movements was yaff dulane both
were orv baileys men and like slim priddy
had the name of being tough hands but jim
knew there was at least one difference slim
priddy had been with bailey for years an-
sell and dulane were new men having come
into the country during the winter after the
wave of homesteaders had settled in jericho
valley

jim malone had untied his team and
was in the seat when ansell and dulane
came up

western

  we hear youre working the settlers up
against us juniper ansell said you aim-
ing to live long or short

  jims movement was swift and amazing
both ansell and dulane blinked as they
stared into the grim muzzle of jims gun

  gents he said coldly youre standing
a little nearer hades than i am which do
you make it a quick trip or do you care for
a few more earthly pleasures

  for a homesteader to draw a gun on two
known hardcases was something like a jack-
rabbit standing in his tracks and slugging
it out with a cougar when ace ansell re-
covered from the shock of surprise his tone
had gone mild now see here juniper
youve got us all wrong we just aimed to
talk things over with you we didnt aim to
get tough now mebbe youd better put that
hogleg up before it goes off i never saw a
nester who could hit a wall of his own house
when he was inside but you might have an
accident

  therell be an accident all right malone
said grimly right in your brisket if you
make a wrong move if you want to talk get
at it ive got a ways to go tonight

  i dont talk good with that thing poked
in my face yaff dulane growled go on
put it up

  if you dont want to talk    malone
began

  all right all right dulane broke in
here it is slim priddy saw you yesterday
about pulling stakes but you didnt listen
youre still here

  a profound observation jim murmured
i am for a fact

  you werent satisfied just to stay here
dulane went on you had to proposition the
rest of the clodbusters about buying posts
you aim to cut we dont aim to beat about
the bush none you deliver one of those
posts and youre a dead man

  that all

its enough aint it ansell snarled
why yes it sounds like it would be just
consider me a dead man i reckon all the
boys in the valley who buy posts will like-
wise be dead men

  mebbe not ansell said well get em
out after we get you out you seem to be the
tough jigger between that and the fact
that youve got all the juniper there is in this
whole blamed country you can figger youll
be on the receiving end of the hot lead when
we start slinging it

  and if i know anything about grangers
dulane added you dont need to expect no
help from them you may be tough juniper
jury for juniper

but you aint tough enough to fight the
bar o

  juniper jim wanted to get a look at slim
priddy but he didnt dare take his eyes away
from ansell and dulane somehow it didnt
quite add up slim had given a warning but
he hadnt talked as if orv bailey planned to
push things immediately malone didnt
know bailey well from what hed heard the
cowman was stubborn and a fighter but he
was also a fair-minded man now ansell
and dulane showed up with tough talk and
the promise of immediate death if he deliv-
ered a single post

  ive got no ambition to fight the bar o
jim said mildly ive seen enough fighting
to last me a lifetime all i want is to be let
alone

  it might be ansell suggested in a low
tone that if youd sell a relinquishment
youd be let alone

  the gunmen had been talking loudly loud
enough for slim priddy to hear but now an-
sells words were so low they barely reached
malone the feeling grew in the nester that
something wasnt right so he probed for
more information

 you willing to buy ansell malone
snapped the question at him

  sure ill buy the gunman said with
quick eagerness whats your price

 i hadnt thought about it would you
give a thousand dollars

  a little steep ansell looked at dulane
and then brought his eyes back to malone
yeah ill pay that

  isnt this funny business for a gunslinger
whos drawing fighting wages from orv
bailey malone queried

  theres no law against it ansell snarled
maybe bailey would pay more than that
malone shook his head thats funny busi-
ness too for a man like bailey 

  are we dealing or aint we ansell de-
manded

  no juniper jim said quickly but i
might deal with your boss tell bailey i
want to see him

  ansell looked like a small boy who had a
bag of candy within reach and then had had
it swept away from him his red face grew
redder with the quick wave of anger that
washed over him

  i wont tell bailey nothing he snarled
before were done you wont be so smart
and you wont be half so tough

  ace ansell swung on his heel and strode
back across the street yaff dulane waited a
moment sultry eyes on malone as if trying
to make up his mind whether the man could



be broken then he too wheeled away and
followed ansell

  jim malone had his look at slim priddy
then the bar o buckaroo had not moved
from the door the cigarette still dangled
from his lip he grinned at malone and the
nester grinned back

  the notion was in his mind that ansell and
dulane were talking for themselves and not
orv bailey

  as he drove out of town he thought about
it but by the time he reached home he had
come to no conclusion he knew men like
ansell and dulane they were the kind who
earned fighting wages by carrying out orders
and slamming lead at whoever got in the way
of their boss but this thing of paying one
thousand dollars for a relinquishment of
nothing more than a butte top covered with
junipers wasnt in line men of ansells and
dulanes caliber usually never got a thousand
dollars together in a lifetime

chapter iii

fire in the night

he following week jim
had little time to worry
about orv bailey or his
gunmen hed scoured
the valley and succeed-
ed in borrowing the tools
that he needed

 he was up at dawn
every morning that
week worked until dark
and fell into bed after
a hasty meal sore of
muscle and utterly tired
every night before he went to sleep he
thought of ann and there was a great satis-
faction in him when he told himself that a
few weeks of post cutting would bring in
enough money for him to send for ann be-
fore the summer was over

  then the satisfaction would go out of him
when he remembered the trouble he faced
he could not send for ann until it was set-
tled finally and completely

  there was no indication that any of baileys
men were watching malone that week he
had not expected trouble until he delivered
his first load of posts he drove back from
that first delivery the winchester within
easy reach eyes raking the sagebrush for
a drygulcher but he reached his shack and
unhitched without trouble

  then as he left the bam he saw something
that both surprised and puzzled him a sur-
	exciting

vey gang was working on the south rim of
dry canyon

  an army of buckaroos coming at him with
lead-belching guns would not have surprised
jim malone but a survey gang peacefully
working on the rim of dry canyon was some-
thing else

 he went back into the barn saddled a
horse and rode toward the canyon by the
time he had reached the rim the men were
gone their camp he guessed would not
be far away and he put his horse down the
south wall following the grade stakes to
the canyon floor an hour later he rounded
a turn and found himself in the camp

  i want to see the boss malone told the
first man he saw

 the man jerked a thumb at a graybeard
who was hunkered by the fire studying a
sheaf of papers

  clint he called this gent wants to see
you

 the graybeard rose and came toward
malone

  what can i do for you he asked

 you can satisfy my curiosity malone
answered when i got home tonight i saw
some of your boys on the south rim of dry
canyon before i got there theyd left
whats up

  you the gent who filed on fox butte

  yes

  a railroads coming into ashfork the
graybeard said not just yet but con-
struction will start by the time you get
proved up right now were trying to figure
out the best way to get up on the plateau
dry canyon gives us an easy grade into
this country but weve got to leave the can-
yon floor along about where you saw the
boys there must have been quite a river
through here at one time and it had a big
falls not far above here because we ran
smack into a two hundred foot cliff

  a good many things were clear as malone
rode home it wasnt the juniper on fox
butte that orv bailey wanted it was an
opportunity to sell a right-of-way to the
railroad an opportunity that meant a for-
tune that explained why ace ansell and
yaff dulane had pressed juniper jim a week
ago in ashfork and why ansell had offered
one thousand dollars for a relinquishment
to it explained zeb crofitts actions ma-
lone was still thinking about it when he
reached the south rim and saw the fires be-
low his house

  for a moment he sat his saddle stunned
by what he saw it was dark now dark
enough so that the row of fires looked like

western

a line of stars along the shoulder of fox
butte he knew without going any farther
that theyd burned his piles of posts

  a weeks work except for the one load
hed delivered was going up in smoke an-
sell and dulane hadnt been fooling they
said hed be a dead man if he delivered a
single post likely they were hiding up in
the junipers where hed been cutting ready
to pour lead into him the minute he showed
up

  a grim stubbornness came into jim ma-
lone then hed go back to his shack fill his
pockets with all the shells he had and swing
down along the south shoulder of the butte
so hed come in below them he rode slowly
confident hat his enemies would wait pa-
tiently for him making a wide circle on the
chance that if he had been seen leaving his
place earlier in the evening baileys crew
might have set a trap for him between the
house and dry canyon

  he left his horse fifty yards from the cabin
and keeping in the junipers along the edge
of the clearing hed made that winter
wormed his way toward the shack it was
possible but hardly probable that men like
ansell and dulane would set a trap for him
in his house and bam theyd expect him
to hightail for the fire which was exactly the
thing he meant not to do

carefully jim malone worked his way
around his woodpile and on to the cor-
ner of the shack there he stopped as a
match flame burst into life he heard a mans
low voice

 where in heck would juniper be slim
fm not going to sit here all night waiting
for him

  chances are hes seen the fires and hes
trying to root somebody out around there
figuring theyve set a trap for him

  it was orv bailey and slim priddy hun-
kering on the ground in front of the shack
without the least effort at concealment their
horses ground-hitched a few yards away
malone didnt move whatever purpose had
brought them here it was not to kill him
and obviously they did not expect him to
make trouble

  wonder who burned them posts bailey
asked

  hard to tell slim answered crofitt
mebbe he sure didnt want jim settling on
fox butte which same i cant understand
unless hes rustling our beef and figured jim
might see something from up here

  it aint that bailey said we havent
lost enough to get excited about
jury for juniper	

  malone stepped into view the hammer of
his gun back

  i dont know what this is about he said
but id like to know bailey dropped his
cigarette stub and toed it out

  its time youre getting here we were
about ready to ride

 somebody burned my posts tonight
malone said it might have been by your
orders bailey figuring that i was so near
starved out id be willing to quit if it was
you might be interested to know im not
quitting if anybodys going to sell a right-
of-way to the railroad i figure itll be me
whats the crazy galoot talking about
bailey asked slim

  im cussed if i know slim answered
mebbe you better talk sense jim

  orv bailey was either a good actor or else
he didnt know about the railroad coming up
dry canyon in the darkness baileys and
slims faces were dark ovals in a darker
night

  look malone bailey said slim told
me you said in town last week that you want-
ed to see me it aint my habit to go calling
on homesteaders but since youre kind of
a key man in these parts i thought i would
just to see what was in your head i didnt
give orders to have your posts burned and
i dont know anything about any railroad
whats more ansell and dulane were acting
on their own when they tried getting tough
with you in town the other day

  malone didnt believe bailey but he didnt
say so

  lets go in he said

  he lighted a lamp and set it on the table
bailey he demanded are you telling
me you didnt know anything about a rail-
road coming up dry canyon

  i sure dont bailey said doggedly ive
been trying to get a railroad in here for
years but id about given it up

  there was a sort of plaintive appeal in orv
baileys face that kept jim from calling him
a liar slim priddy had come in but bailey
was standing in the open doorway the lamp-
light washing into the night around him

  it sure is jim said i saw a survey
outfit on the south rim when i got home i
went down into the canyon to where their
camp was and talked to the boss he said
they had to come out of the canyon about
where i saw the outfit that makes my place
worth a pile of money bailey when i get my
patent it makes sense now why ace ansell
said hed give me a thousand dollars for a re-
linquishment i figured he was talking for
you

  t didnt hear him say that slim said
and i was sure bending my ears your way

  ansell wasnt talking for me bailey
shouted i  

  orv bailey never finished his sentence
from the fringe of junipers below the house
a winchester cracked the flash a vivid flame
in the night bailey lurched with the impact
of the slug and sprawled his length on the
floor

wim malone reached the table in one
long stride blew out the lamp and hit
the floor just as a second winchester from
the barn slammed a shot into the shack be-
fore the echo of the first had died

  the dirty sons that burned my posts
malone said have a look at bailey slim
im going after them keep up a fire from
the door and window so theyll think both
of us are in here

  he crawled through the door and around
the shack rifle bullets shrieking overhead
like persistent life-seeking hornets he
moved away from the shack into the clear-
ing and on toward the barn then he stopped
noting carefully the position of the man in
the barn he was probably malone thought
standing just inside the door but the night
was too dark to make out the mans figure

  the men below the house had stopped fir-
ing they were likely ace ansell and yaff
dulane malone guessed but why if they
were working for orv bailey would they do
the job they had done tonight

  he was convinced now that bailey had no
part in the effort to buy his relinquishment
nor in ansells and dulanes threats why
then were ansell and dulane carrying out
their threats for that question jim could
think of only one answer they must have
found out about the railroad coming up dry
canyon and they were working their own
thieving murderous game

  slim priddy was answering the fire from
the shack window with it distracting the
man in the barn malones movements against
a black earth would likely go unseen then
he remembered orv bailey and knew he
could wait no longer the cattleman had
gone down like a man either hit hard or
dead if he were wounded there would be
but little time to get him to the medico in
ashfork

  malone waited until the man in the bam
started shooting again then he began firing
laying his shots a foot apart and waist high
when his colt was empty he rolled away
reloaded and waited

  there was no sound still thinking of
	exciting

bailey malone ran toward the bam stumbled
over a body in the doorway and fell inside
he pulled the body away from the door just
as slim opened up again his bullets scream-
ing through the doorway or thudding into
the wall

  when slim stopped malone lighted a
match and cupping it with a hand held it
to the mans face it was yaff dulane stone
dead

  we got dulane malone called hold
your fire ansells probably down in the
junipers well root him out

  you bet well root him out slim yelled
the dirty son got orv purty hard

  again malone waited wondering if an-
sell had come toward the barn or whether
he was waiting in the junipers he didnt
wait long for a few second after slim had
yelled he heard the pound of a horses hoofs
below the house ace ansell would be on
his way to town and there malone thought
grimly hed finish the job unless ansell lost
his nerve and kept on going

  hes pulled his freight slim malone
shouted ill harness up and well get
bailey into town

  bailey had been hit high in the chest a
dangerous wound but not necessarily a fatal
one slim bandaged the bullet hole while
juniper jim harnessed his team they laid
bailey in the wagon bed and covered him
with a blanket for the night chill had set in

  it dont make sense slim muttered bit-
terly why that polecat would want to drill
orv unless mebbe he thought it was you you
and orv are about the same build mebbe he
let go before he knew who was standing in
the doorway i knew him and dulane was
no good and i told orv that

  how did bailey happen to hire them
malone asked

  priddy swore wrathfully

  matt royce talked him into it he claimed
wed have trouble with the grangers and
orv had better be prepared with some gun-
slingers it was royce that sent for em all
winter royce has been trying to egg orv
into getting tough i dont reckon hed have
sent me out the other day if royce hadnt
kept prodding him orv never was one to
make trouble

  ill drive and you better ride back in the
box with bailey slim said we dont want
him bouncin around and losin claret
take it easy malone instructed climbing
the wheel spokes to reach his patient and
keep a gun handy all the way to town
hand me baileys six-gun slim said
from the seat its quicker to get than a
rifle

western

chapter iv

the pay was in lead

t was midnight when
they pulled up in front
of the medicos office
the only lights along
main street were in
the windows of royces
mercantile and the
union bar slim pound-
ed on the door until the
doctor opened it a lamp
held in his hand he
	was wearing a white

	nightshirt and rubbing

his eyes

  whats wrong slim

  orvs shot doc hes got a slug in his
brisket and hes lost a lot of blood

  orv bailey the medico swung around
and put down his lamp all desire for sleep
going out of him howd he get into a gun
ruckus

  he was bushed slim said wrathfully
by ace ansell

  they carried bailey into the doctors of-
fice and laid him on a bed in a back room

  not so bad the medico said after hed
had his look but he wont be on his pins
for awhile ansell shot him eh i thought
ansell was working for him

  so did orv priddy said and began to
swear theres something going on i aint
figgered out we got dulane but ansell got
away

  gunslingers like that never do a country
any good the medico said

  malone went back into the office he sat
smoking thinking back over the things that
had happened since hed settled on fox butte
zeb crofitt had said hed have trouble with
bailey more than once when hed bought
supplies in royces store hed heard royce
say that bailey wouldnt let him stay through
his first year if anybody in the country
would know about a railroad coming in it
would be crofitt and knowing the country
he could have guessed that the railroad
would come in through dry canyon and
that it would leave the canyon at juniper
jims place

  it began to fit and malone knew he should
have seen it sooner he would have if crofitt
and royce hadnt successfully built a smoke
screen around orv bailey crofitt had want-
ed to keep fox butte open until he was sure
what route the railroad would take and then
likely he or royce would have filed on it
jury for juniper	

  malone stepped to the door and flipped
his cigarette stub into the street he stood
there wondering about ace ansell and not-
ing that now the only light along the street
was in the window of the union bar he
was guessing that ansell had hidden in the
store and he decided that it was as good a
time as any to wind this up he stepped
back into the office checked his gun and
returned it to its holster it was then he
heard steps on the boardwalk he wheeled
toward the door hand on gun butt as the big
figure of matt royce filled the doorway

  i saw your team out there royce said
smoothly and got to wondering what had
happened

  i brought orv bailey in malone said
watching the mans face he got plugged
in the back at my place

  orv why thats too bad hurt bad
bad enough jim snapped he thought
of saying that ace ansell did it and prob-
ably by either royces or crofitts orders
but he didnt royce wouldnt have come
here if he hadnt a scheme in mind and
the chances were good that royces or per-
haps crofitts scheming would do the very
thing malone wanted    bring ansell into
the open

  im sorry royce said you know
jim im plumb regretful about not letting
you have them tools last week i knew id
made a mistake as soon as you left you
come on down to the store now that youve
got your wagon in town you might as well
take em home

  it was a trap the smell was too strong
ansell had told royce and crofitt what had
happened and they aimed to finish the job
that had been started on fox butte finish
it with hot lead for jim malone still know-
ing that it was a trap he nodded agreeably

   thats right nice of you matt sure ill
go along

he should have told slim where he
was going three to one odds were
too big for any man to buck but it was up
to him to buck exactly that he didnt want
royce to know he was suspicious and if he
called to slim priddy the storekeeper would
know so he stepped through the doorway
with royce it might be a gun trap along
the street with ace ansell hiding in the
darkness of an alleyhead but jim didnt think
so not with royce along the chances
were too good that ansell might get the
wrong man in the blackness that lay along
the street

  it sure is too bad about orv royce was

saying as they moved up the walk toward
his store hes a big man in this country
if he dies theres no one to replace him
but you kept saying all winter that id
have trouble with him before the year was
out malone prodded

  and you did royce said quickly

  the trouble wasnt with orv bailey the
nester thought but he let it go he went
into the store with royce and followed him
through the darkness along the counter
ive got the stuff you picked out laid
away back here royce said i dunno why
i didnt let you take it the other day but
i guess it was because i dont do much credit
business and i didnt have time to think it
over

  matt royce was lying as fast as he could
talk but malone let him think he was put-
ting it over the storekeeper opened the
door into the back room struck a match
and lighted a lamp

  here it is jim he called over his shoul-
der want me to help you pack it out to
your wagon or can you make out i was
just walking home from the union bar
when i saw you in the docs office and i
thought you might just as well take these
things as long as you were in town

  malone had not gone into the room he
stood in the doorway gun in hand and his
words cut across the room with the sting
of a whiplash

  royce youre a liar and a killer inside
the room along the wall youve got crofitt
and ansell all set to burn me down when
i come in and then maybe youd try to pin
baileys shooting on to me ansell might
come up with a lie about seeing me do it
there was silence then the tight silence
that ribbons on and on and seems to have
no end seconds that pull out into what
seems hours royce stood with his back to
malone not moving still facing the table
where the lamp stood

  what are you going to call it royce
jim asked and pronged back the hammer of
his gun youre playing for big money
youll never get in case you didnt know
youd be interested in hearing that the
railroad survey crew is already up to my
place in dry canyon i figure you and crofitt
told ansell and dulane to burn my posts
so it would look like bailey ordered it then
they were supposed to gun me down so id
be out of the way and still the blame would
be on bailey it didnt work royce

  still royce made no move and again the
silence was upon them silence that pulled
mens nerves to the breaking point and past
		exciting

then royce made his play whipping a gun
from a shelf below the table top wheeling
and squeezing trigger malone let him go
that far and as he fired knew hed made a
mistake for it was then ace ansell came
into view his colt spewing lead royce
spun away from the table a chunk of lead
in his heart and sprawled over a sack of
grain

ansell had that advantage of time
enough to drive a slug into malone
that sliced along his ribs ripped open a
bloody gash and went on to bury itself in
the wall but ace ansell had hurried his
shot he never had another chance for
malone had laced a bullet into his chest

  he began to wilt gun dribbling from
nerveless fingers went down on hands and
knees held himself there an instant as he
groped in sudden blindness for the gun hed
dropped and then fell and lay motionless

  jim malone stayed in the doorway eyes
stabbing the shadows for zeb crofitt the
locator should be in on the play but he
wasnt malone didnt see him until hed
stepped into the room crofitt was lying in
the comer jim thought his hands and feet
were tied or he had been knocked cold but
when he knelt beside the locator he saw
that crofitt was dead his skull had been
smashed by a hammer

  you fool slim priddy shouted as he
dashed in from the store you crazy lame-
brained fool whatd you tackle this job by
yourself for then his eyes swept the
room and slowly came back to malone
admiration breaking across his face fella
you sure did a job

  i had all the powder-burning i wanted
malone said as he got to his feet when i
was riding for an outfit in idaho but guess
trouble just sort of rolls my way maybe
wed better go get the marshal and tell
him what happened

  later when the story had been told and
the medico had patched jims side slim
priddy stood beside the mahogany in the
union bar and poured the drinks he said
regretfully

  looks like well never know the whole
yam but i dont reckon weve missed much
i figger it was royce kicking all this up
trying to make it look like orv was doing it

  you know the real reason orv came out
to see you tonight was to find out all that
ansell and dulane said hed kept worry-
ing it around in his head all week after i
told him what- id heard in town he
couldnt figger out why they was so proddy

western

he hadnt said nothing to em about pouring
it on

  i dont reckon hell make any trouble
now for the grangers hes got enough range
and theres times when he needs to buy
hay and grain might work all right for
everybody orvs a purty good hombre
one thing well never know malone
said thoughtfully is whether crofitt or
royce was behind the trouble

  i still say royce slim said he was
the one who brought ansell and dulane in
dont forget that likewise he was the one
that sucked you into what he thought would
be a trap with ansell waiting to plug you
probably he found out through crofitt about
the railroad for years royce has belly-
ached about barely making a living when
other gents meaning orv wgs rolling in
dinero

anyhow crofitt got his they must have
had an argument about who got the gravy
or else royce and ansell wanted all of it
slim fingered his drink a far-away look
in his eyes

  you know jim orv had a girl once that
was before he built the bar o into a big
outfit he kept waiting to make a lot of
money and she up and let another galoot
put a loop on her i told orv about your
view and the ozone and about your girl
it kind o got him he was aiming to tell
you hed buy all the posts you didnt sell
the grangers and hed buy wood from you
he says if you send for that girl right quick
hed even see you got a real good bull for
a wedding present he says youve got to
run a few head of stock just to keep from
being a common old granger hell see to
it you and your new wife wont starve
then i reckon me and orv will get
along malone said he thought about ann
about her pug nose and her blue eyes and
her yellow hair he thought about the way
shed kissed him that last time and how
shed said it would be a long year

  orv says that all newcomers in a country
have to be kind o tried by a jury of what
happens before theyre a part of the country
looks to me like youve had your trial
tonight from now on youll be a part of
the country just like fox butte

  then ill be writing ann a letter juni-
per jim said and getting her out here
pronto yes sir slim were going to raise
wheat and a crop of kids maybe i wont will
them a lot of money when i cash in but im
sure of one thing im going to start them
on top of fox butte where they can see a
little ways past the end of their pug noses
he-man deputy

by joe payne

when a guitar-playing crooner came along and made eyes at
his gal deputy hunk sanders just itched for some actioni

my young deputy hunk sanders
stomped back to the office with his
wide mouth turned down he
planted his bow-legged chunk of body in
front of my desk and held out a pasteboard
container

  that he growled was the commotion
the barbers button poured some of it down
a customers collar i planted a boot in the
kids britches and confiscated the itchin
powder

  i pocketed the container grinning

  well hold it for evidence i said

  hunks blue eyes glowered into guldoros
main drag

  a heck of a place he opined four

months as your deputy and all that time the
town quieter than kiug tuts tomb

 i eyed him close

 why dont you quit grumpin and pop the
 question to grace loveland

 hunks face got red

 grace is not going to marry no two-bit
 deputy with exactly twenty frogskins in the
 bank

 maybe grace dont want no hero or rich
 plutocrat i pointed out

 hunk turned slow and looked me square
 in the eye

 listen he said a kind of huskiness in
 his tone my pa was a forty-and-fodder
 cowhand all his life when he died ma and
	exciting western

 us kids were livin in a two-room shack ma
 worked herself to death takin in washing to
 support us he drew a slow breath im
 not lettin grace in for anything like that
 before i ask her to marry me ive got to
 prove to myself i can amount to somethin
 i couldnt find any answer to that so i
 pulled the morning paper off the desk

  you must have gandered at this already
i told him

  the front page article stated that the safe
over at the sage city bank had been mysteri-
ously cracked the night before and ten thou-
sand dollars stole a reward of five hundred
dollars had been offered for the apprehension
of the thief or thieves

  i saw it hunk admitted thats the
second bank safe thats been robbed lately
a week ago it was the one at elk river
im keepin my eyes open

  no need suspectin every stranger you
see i admonished you been actin like
sherlock holmes all mornin

  hunk didnt answer he was staring at a
passing rider on a big bay horse he stepped
out the door and moved down the street i
followed

  the rider turned off at willow street into
the alley back of the bank and opera house
hunk was stompin after him watching him
so close he didnt see grace loveland ridin
her sorrel gelding into town

  i met grace at the corner she reined in
her brown eyes shooting daggers after hunk

  whats eating him she demanded he
passed me up like a lop-eared sheep

  hes hastenin to investigate an evil-look-
ing character so he can be a hero maybe or
get a reward so he can-

  ask me to marry him grace snapped
you told me that one before why didnt
that bow-legged lununox stay punching cows
where he belongs

  let us proceed to the alley i suggested
uncomfortable

  suddenly she blinked hard and her red
lips trembled

i love him she wailed id marry him
today if we had to live in a one-room nesters
cabin but i cant even get him to ask me
eyes stormy she turned her gelding to
follow me

  the stranger a salty-looking redhead
had stopped at the hoss-trough behind the
bank hunk halted beside him as we reached
the alley

  ridin through hunk asked cold or
stoppin

  the redhead glanced down from his sad-
dle

  yeah

 whats your business here hunk
snapped

  waterin my hoss

  i didnt like your mug when you passed
the office my deputy stated i hate it now
ride on

  this i take it is public property the
stranger sneered however ill ride on
since that is what i aimed to do in the first
place

  so sayin he galloped off

hunk stomped back to where we was
watching his face red

  howdy grace he said

  ignoring him she leaned down and grabbed
the newspaper i was still holding

  oh look she hollered a picture of
rudy manfredo

  she read the caption out loud

  rudy manfredo sensational singing gui-
tarist gae a program at the sage city opera
house last night as usual the handsome
young artist was well-nigh mobbed by femi-
nine admirrers his manager signor alberti
proved a suave master of ceremonies

  it went on to say that the audience was
held spellbound etc etc and ended by
statin that rudys next appearance would be
at guldoro friday night

  grace sighed and raised her eyes ecstatic-
like

what a package of male beauty she
breathed i can hardly wait till tonight
ladyfingers hunk grumbled any man
thatd spend his time lollygaggin around like
that wears lace on his shirt-tail

  thats not what half the women in the
country are saying grace retorted cool
you might get some pointers tonight
bah

  i grinned grace was layin it on thick for
hunks benefit she was takin a different
tack in egging him on

  speakin of the devil or angel as the
case may be i put in whats that gaudy
lookin wagon pulling into town

  its rudy grace squealed i can see
the sign on the side

  she swung the sorrel toward the guldoro
hotel where the wagon pulled by two white
hosses was stopping hunk and me fol-
lowed

  two men were gettin off the wagon seat
one was a short dark hombre the other
one tall and slim and blond started bowin
and wavin at the gals and the small fry
flockin around he kissed his hand admir-
ing-like at grace as she controlled the
he-man deputy



antics of her sorrel

 grace favored him with a smile like the
 sun bustin up over the desert and hunk
 cussed under his breath

 i dont like the looks of them hombres
 he muttered i got a hunch theyve been
 doin the bank robbin lately

 i snorted

 the green-eyed monster has throwed you
 for certain i told him

 barlow the editor of the sentinal scuttled
 up carryin his photograph outfit

 how about a picture rudy he chortled
 something snappy for the paper

 rudy bowed graceful

 delighted

 just a minute the dark hombre grinned
 lets put some local color in it he pointed
 at grace young lady could i prevail on
 you to pose with rudy

 easy grace answered prompt

 she swung off her mount and joined them
 the guitar player put an arm around her and
 grinned while barlow stuck his head under
 his camera cloth

 hold on hunk said his face like a
 thundercloud you hombres got a license to
 operate here

 certainly the dark one answered
 frowning the marshal knows about it

 hunk glared at me

 anyhow we can do it without this picture
 tomfoolery he said

 rudy looked at him then he looked at
 grace

 aha he said well my belligerent
 friend unless you can think up some law
 to stop us well let the young lady decide

 grace gave him an adoring look

 go on mr barlow she said

 they snapped the picture while hunk
 fumed then rudy kissed graces hand and
 beat it into the hotel like he was afraid of
 bein mobbed grace climbed her saddle and
 rode off givin hunk another good ignoring

 milksop hunk growled lookin like he
 aimed to stomp after rudy im a mind to
 knock him down and gallop his works out

 it looked like all guldoro was in the
 opera house at eight oclock i took my
 stand at the back where i could watch the
 crowd and stop any trouble before it got
 started i could see grace settin near the
 front and hunk settin two or three seats
 back of her

 hunk was glowerin like he was afraid
 somebody might see him there but he neednt
 have worried since all the so-called he-
 men were there likewise grace was eyein

 the stage breathless and now and then
 sneakin a glance at hunk

  the dark hombre came onto the stage
wearin a black monkey-suit they called a
tuxedo he skinned his teeth at the crowd
and held up his hand

  ladies and gentlemen he orated i
am signor alberti manager of tonights
artist i am happy to see such a fine crowd
this evening now without further ado i
give you the one you have all been waiting
for rudy manfredo

  rudy oozed onto the stage luggin a guitar
he had on a black mexican-looking outfit
with gold trimmins and a sombrero that
hung at the back of his neck he looked slim
and elegant and when he bowed his hair
shone like a new-minted penny a long
sigh swept through the opera house like
wind through pine tree tops

  rudy squatted on a chair the guitar across
his knees he raked off a couple of chords
and started to moan like a maverick caught
in a wire fence the moan wound up statin
that all that mattered in this vale of tears
was love

  squeals and howls came from the audience
the young females started a rush toward the
stage grace led all the others

  they swamped rudy manfredo tearin
buttons and braid off his outfit mussin his
hair and some even trying to plant kisses on
his face

  signor alberti tore out on the stage his
hands raised toward heaven

  ladies he hollered ladies

  he finally got them off the stage i could
see hunk glaring at grace lots of other
fellows in the crowd was doin the same to
their female companions i didnt blame hunk
much it was plumb disgustin

  rudy put his shirt-tail in and smoothed
his hair down he smiled toward grace then
faced the crowd actin mad

  whats the matter with guldoro he
asked sarcastic arent there any he-men
here

  a growl swept the room three or four
cowpokes jumped up but hunk beat them
all to the stage

  my deputy shook a fist under rudy man-
fredos snoot

  listen fauntleroy he snarled theres
lots of men around here can handle you i
can whip you any way you name

  rudy eyed him contemptuous

  if it isnt the belligerent law-man you
sure youre not takin advantage of this
he tapped hunks badge

  my deputy tore off his badge


exciting western

  if you was wearin a smoke-pole youd
eat your words he bellowed

  gentlemen signor alberti put in this
is a musical program

  he put out his hand dramatic toward the
audience then placed his paw on hunks
shoulder

  are you challenging rudy to a fight
he asked impressive a western duel
one of these days youre gonna reach
out an arm and draw back a stub hunk
growled throwin off the paw take what
i said for what its worth

  the signor glanced at rudy who was twid-
dlin his guitar strings careless-like

  rudy you have insulted the gentleman
he said you must give him satisfaction
since this started in public i suggest that
it be finished in public

  suits me hunk said

  as the challenged party i have the choice
of weapons rudy put in

  name it hunk snapped guns or
knives-or wheelbarrows at forty paces
wait the dark hombre said

  he scuttled into the wings and came back
with two pairs of boxing gloves and shoes
and two pairs of little panty britches he had
a metal gong too

  ten rounds to a decision he announced
marquis of queensbury rules

  hunk stared at the gloves and britches
hed never had a pair of either on in his
life i was gettin uneasy it was too cut
and dried it looked like hunk had stuck his
neck out likely the blond love moaner was
plenty handy with his lunch-hooks him
and his manager had worked this up deliber-
ate as part of the act but it was too late for
hunk to back out now even if he wanted to
hed done the challenging

grace looked tickled to have them fight-
ing over her she didnt care a blast
whether hunk got whipped or not shed
made him declare himself in a way

  i wont wear no panties hunk growled
you cant fight like street brawlers al-
berti said he raised his voice well need
a referee a home-town refei-ee i wont be
accused of bias well need a time-keeper
too he held up the gong three minute
rounds

  i stepped to the stage fast hunk would
need what help i could give him there was
a t-in-a-box cowpoke right behind me
ill referee i announced

  and ill keep time the cowpoke said
pulling a turnip out of his pocket

  alberti handed me the gloves and britches

he handed the gong to the t-in-a-box
puncher

  ill retire to the wings and let you nm
the fight when its over well continue the
concert

  i had a sudden idee that itchin powder
was still in my pocket

  shake hands i ordered

  hunk hesitated muttering but he finally
grabbed the paw rudy stuck out i grinned
to myself nobody had seen me palm the
itchin powder with my hand inside the pair
of green panties i rubbed them liberal with
the powder while pretendin to inspect them
and the gloves

  all right i said handing rudy the
powdered britches and hunk the others go
dress

  the excitement was growing men were
crowdin toward the front and betting money
was bein passed around the women were
sitting tight grace was laughing and shak-
ing hands with herself

  i grinned too when that itchin powder
hit rudy he wouldnt look so elegant my
own caloused palm was beginnin to itch and
burn like fire it was a dirty trick but rudy
and alberti had tricked hunk into makin a
sap of himself they had it cornin

  hunk and rudy appeared escorted by
alberti the signor waved them onto the
stage bowing then disappeared again in the
wings

  i sucked in my breath rudy had on the
purple britches and hunk had the green ones
with the powder in em the purple ones
fitted rudy better apparently and he
mustve been used to wearing em

  i laced on their gloves my brain goin like
mad hunk was all right yet the powder
hadnt hit him

  ill call this thing off i whispered to
him urgent

  hunk flexed his muscles grim-like eyein
the slim-built rudy who was posin at the
crowd

  like heck

  whats the matter your man wanting to
back out rudy cracked

  hunk glared i motioned to the cowpoke
with the turnip

  play ball i ordered weak

  the cowpoke hit the gong and hunk
rushed confident he was two inches shorter
than the blond moaner but broader and
solider he swung a haymaker but rudy
danced away and shot out a glove against
his snoot

  hunk growled and began to lash out hard
in all directions he only flailed the air he
he-man

was too slow and his footwork was awful

 mr rudy manfredo danced in and out
and around hunk grinning contempuous his
jong legs as graceful as an antelopes his
hair wasnt even mussed he wasnt hittin
hunk hard just cuttin him up a little 
saw he figured on carryin hunk along for
several rounds while he showed off

  the crowd was yelling hard the men for
hunk and lots of the women for rudy

  all of a sudden as i butted between the
battlers tryin to save hunk punishment
my deputy let out a bellow like a wounded
buffalo he jumped four feet in the air and
come down with his legs churnin he circled
rudy a mile a minute starin wildlike

  the surprised guitar-twiddler managed to
catch him a belt on the whiskers then hunk
was on him my deputy was a terror now-
a whirlwind of feet and gloves and elbows
that blew from all directions his footwork
was somethin to behold he swung three or
four haymakers at once and the last one
caught rudy flush on the chops

  the guitar player hurtled backward he
lit on the floor rolled clean over and lay
there toes up the crowd let out a roar
and i rushed at hunk but my deputy wasnt
waitin for his arm to be raised in victory
he tore into the wings like a turpentined cat

i hightailed after him hunk wasnt
in the wings but the stage door was
standin open i plunged into the alley

  i knew where hunk was headin if id
of been in his panties id of been hot-footin
for that horse-trough behind the bank too

  a sudden gunshot blasted i stopped short
another slug buzzed past my ear

  plungin out of the shadows cast by the
thin moon a horseman was tryin to ride
me down i jumped aside cussin and
grabbed my smoke-pole out of its holster

  i fired just as the rider did his slug flut-
tered my sleeves but i emptied the saddle
above me the hoss went plunging on

  i ran on lookin for hunk then i heard
splashin at the hoss-trough hunk was
settin in the trough up to his chest in water
he had signor alberti in a bear-hug

  the signor was threshin and cussin but
it wasnt doin him any good as i arrived
hunk got him turned the way he wanted him
he shot out his fist a couple of times and
alberti was quiet my deputy dumped the
signor out onto the ground

  there you are he panted i caught
him beatin it out the back door of the bank
with a satchel the satchels right by your
feet youll likely find it full of greenbacks

deputy	

jumpin bulfrogs i said snatchin up

trouble

by bill

     you keep away from the girl
     dave stewart is warned when

hen ruth ann sighted the wind-
whipped banners and dancing flags
of the rodeo grandstand her heart
began to thump with excitement this year
in the pecos stampede she was to be a con-
testant for the first time her trick sorrel
pony sergeant was attached by halter rope
to the tailgate of the buckboard that was
taking her and her father bill dart to
town

oh dad ruth anns voice was trem-
bling with excitement ive just got to win
my first try

you wont if you dont calm down and
take things easy bill dart answered with
a sly grin just make as if you believe
youre puttin your pony through his paces

anson

or put a gun on your hip-
he signs on the dart ranch

in our ranch corral ive told you lots of
times that the mark of a professional is a
cool head back on the rodeo circuit in the
old days when i was riding there was a
girl who  

ruth anns father launched into another
of his long tales about the time when he
was the state bucking champion in addi-
tion to many medals and ribbons to show for
those days bill dart also had a badly crippled
leg which he had received when a loco
bronc crashed into the arena fence his prize
money had been invested in a small breed-
ing ranch near the town of pecos but after
the death of mrs dart things had not gone
so well for bill dart and his daughter now
ruth ann felt it was up to her to earn money
trouble

for new stock and to fill the larder

 she had won out over her fathers pro-
tests that the rodeo ring was no place for a
girl as pretty as she was her sea-green
eyes and golden hair were the talk of the
pecos river country range gossip said that
ruth ann would soon be wearing curly
lamberts brand and that it would be wise
for young buckaroos to forget her curly
lambert was not only the biggest grower of
rodeo stock along the pecos river but also
the owner of most of the town of pecos

 what ruth ann had to say about her
purported engagement would have burned
the ears off curly lambert she was no
mans woman her chief interest in life was
horses not swaggering young swains

 ruth ann had bottle-fed her pony ser-
geant as a colt she had trained him to do
tricks that not even her father had seen on
the rodeo circuit starting this day she meant
to make a reputation for herself as one of the
most skilled riders of the west that was
why her heart was thumping so wildly as the
buckboard carried her past the rodeo grounds
and into the main street of pecos

 the moment the crowds before the false-
fronted stores saw ruth anns pretty cos-
tume they knew she was a performer and a
cheer went up she wore a frilled buck-
skin blouse divided riding skirt and cream
colored half-boots her white stetson had
a fancy rattlesnake skin band and about her
neck was a fancy bright-hued silk scarf
with indian drawings

 watch out for sergeant bill dart said
warningly as the belted and booted men
along the plank sidewalks uttered loud
yippees and cowboy yells

ruth ann had already sensed the
growing nervousness of her horse
this was the first time that her lovely sorrel
had been in a big crowd the movements of
dusty buggies and saddle broncs on the
street were beginning to frighten sergeant
had the pony not been tied to the buck-
boards tailgate sergeant would have run
away

 as ruth ann swung over the front seat
and quickly crawled through the wagon box
to reach the ponys halter rope she heard
several firecrackers explode in the road-
way she caught one swift glimpse of a
group of boisterous punchers just drunk
enough to be unthinking and mischievous
standing in front of the town hotel they
were the gun ranch hands and curly lam-
bert their boss was with them

 the gun ranch owner was waving to

brewing	

ruth ann he didnt see what she saw a
hilarious member of curlys outfit had ig-
nited the fuse of a cannon cracker and the
puncher now threw it into the road toward
the hoofs of the buckboard team that bill
dart was driving

  before ruth ann could release sergeants
halter at the tailgate the cannon cracker
exploded at once the buckboard team
reared up in terror the rig careened over
on its side the next moment the team was
leaping out in panic and the rig was dragging
at sergeants halter for a short distance
the buckboard lurched from one side to the
other before a swingletree tore loose and
the rig turned over

  bill dart shouted in anger as he went
sprawling into the roadway ruth ann was
thrown clear out of the back of the buck-
board her sorrel pony was dragged down to
its knees where it fought in the dirt to get up
again

  the girl landed hard in the road but she
was quickly on her feet running to help
her trick horse

  tearing the halter buckle open she re-
leased sergeant from the rope that held him
to the back of the overturned buckboard
the sorrel frantically was trying to get up on
its legs ruth ann gripped him by the
mane and talked soothingly in an effort to
calm his terror

  dont fight the pony miss a voice cried
to ruth ann looks like hes hurt let him
go hell do better by himself

  instead of rising completely sergeant sank
back to earth again and slid his left foreleg
out straight two arms strong as bands oi
steel closed around ruth ann they be-
longed to the man who had spoken behind
her he drew her away from the frantic
sorrel

  please let me go she said breathlessly
turning about youre right my pony is
injured

  he has to find that out himself the tall
stranger answered watch him hes getting
up now

  in her concern for the sorrel ruth ann
was only dimly aware that the man helping
her was dressed in the fancy calfskin vest
and bullhide chaps of a rodeo performer
she failed to notice until later how blue and
serious were his eyes and how handsomely
shaped was his strong firm jaw

 sergeant was shaking with fear as he
scrambled up and stood stiff-legged with his
eyes rolling wildly dirt covered his smoothly
curried flank he lifted his left foreleg and
pawed the earth nervously then put the leg
	exciting

down and turned his head to look at ruth
ann

  sergeant she cried the man released
his grip ruth ann rushed forward and
threw her arms aboyt the neck of the trick
horse then she let go stepped back and
tried to see if there was anything wrong

  a crowd was gathering the horse backed
away from ruth ann as he moved she
saw he was limping slightly

  get back friends the tall rodeo per-
former in the calfskin vest called out give
the bronc a little room

  it was at this moment that curly lambert
arrived

  ml take charge here dave stewart the
owner of the gun ranch said sharply you
better get on over to the arena if you intend
to ride in the bucking contest for my outfit
my girl doesnt need any more help from
you

  your girl ruth ann exclaimed turn-
ing toward the big-shouldered curly lam-
bert i never was and i never will be that
curly lambert it was one of your punchers
who threw that firecracker oh but you all
are hateful she swung away as she saw
her father limping up to the sorrel dad
are you hurt she asked

  its sergeant im worrying about bill
dart answered evasively but his pale cheeks 
revealed that he had not escaped the accident
without harm the team is getting chased
through town and the buckboard is ruined
plenty

  i fired the hand who threw the cannon
cracker mr dart curly lambert said
apologetically also since it was him who
was responsible for the bustin of your buck-
board you have the blacksmith fix it and ill
pay all the bills

  ruth anns temper got the better of her

  you knew this was my one chance to be-
come a circuit rider curly lambert she
flared up and i wouldnt be a bit sur-
prised if you didnt plan the whole thing
look at my pony now you cant make any
amends for sergeant with your money

  shucks ill buy the cayuse at top price
and lend you one of my broncs for the show
the gun ranch boss said grinning at the
irate girl

  the rodeo performer in the calfskin vest
had not gone away now he spoke reassur-
ingly to ruth ann

  hes more frightened than hurt the tall
stranger said

  are you sure she asked him anxiously
hes a trick horse i trained him myself

  just a minor strain in his left foreleg

western

miss its not serious but dont try to ride
him today its best not to i know a lot
about trick broncs

  nobody is asking your opinion stewart
curly lambert snapped i told you once
before to get over to the rodeo ring if youre
riding for me ill handle this

  are you riding in the contests for the
gun ranch ruth ann asked dave stewart
eyeing him with sudden disfavor

  i reckon i was riding stewart answered
forcing a hard smile

  ruth ann turned to her father

  ill take sergeant over to the ring and
see if hes able to go through his tricks she
said it would be better if doctor small
looked at your leg dad dont take a cent of
curly lamberts money we are through
with him

  that suits me bill dart replied hand-
ing ruth ann the halter that he had released
from the tailgate of the overturned buck-
board

  the crowd began to break up as ruth ann
haltered sergeant curly lambert made no
move to help her she saw dave stewart
walk over to a hitch-rail and swing aboard
a big black horse and ride off

  when she led sergeant down the street
toward the rodeo grounds the pony limped
slightly once the sorrel halted to rub its
nose on its left foreleg when sergeant lifted
his head again he looked at ruth ann with
appealing eyes then tried to walk without a
limp

concern for sergeant kept ruth ann
from participating in the thrill of this
picturesque western rodeo she ignored the
lively band music the gaily dressed crowds
the bright costumes and the jokes of the
light-spirited throngs the grandstand was
rapidly filling with women in gay summer
dresses and their escorts in ten gallon hats
over at the end of the arena steers were
kicking in the chutes and now and then a
wild horse squealed with fright and anger

  with sergeant in tow ruth ann passed
through the open gate to the big corral where
the performers saddle ponies were kept
several friends greeted her the rodeo vet-
erinary came up to ask her what had hap-
pened out on the main street

  a rider for the gun ranch just told me
to bandage the left foreleg of your sorrel
the white-haired vet added his name is
dave stewart

  i dont need any advice from curly lam-
berts employes ruth ann said but some
liniment for sergeant would help
trouble

  the vet went to work swiftly while a
crowd of performers gathered to express
their sympathies to the girl ruth ann saw
that dave stewart was not among them al-
though his big black cayuse was tied to the
rails at the far end of the corral when the
loudspeaker blasted on the grandstand side
of the arena all the performers ran to their
broncs for the big parade

  ruth anns heart sank she had planned so
long on this rodeo it was to have been the
first one in which she was privileged to
ride past the grandstand as a contestant

  better let the pony rest the veterinary
said after he had finished wrapping the sor-
rels left leg with cotton i can see hes a
trick horse hell be wary of putting that left
hoof down my advice is to get another
horse for the show

  that means ill have to withdraw ruth
ann said will it hurt sergeant to work
out

  it wont hurt the pony but you cant
expect good results the veterinary replied
tlie sorrel barked his fetlock joint above the
hoof the lower part of the leg is sore like
your thumb would be if you tapped it with a
hammer

  ruth anns heart sank she walked across
the corral and looked at the parade now
carrying the stars and stripes past the re-
viewing box as she stood there trying
to keep her tears back the performers came
on around the arena and then broke line at
the chutes now the crowd was cheering
so loudly that no one could understand what
the announcer was saying through the loud-
speaker

  the rodeo had begun the first contest
was trick roping the first team ran out
into the open to the platform laid on the
ground and there a cowboy and a cowgirl
started spinning ropes the spectators quieted
down and ruth ann could hear the an-
nouncer giving the names of the performers

  her interest died away she turned back
across the corral to inspect sergeant stand-
ing tied to the rails performers were putting
up their mounts and choosing new ones
everybody was too busy to pay any atten-
tion to ruth ann she slowly saddled her
sorrel then led the pony across the corral
twice watching to see if the horse limped
sergeant was walking easily on all four
legs but his spirit was down the horse
took no interest in what was going on around
him

  are you going to ride ruth ann one
of the girl performers called youd better
get ready

brewing	

  for the first time ruth ann realized that
the contestants now were watching her
closely this was her first performance
everybody was curious to learn how her act
would be received

 as ruth ann swung to the saddle she
forced a smile and she was glad to see that
her friends replied with confident grins
several wished her good luck as she rode
throuh the gate into the arena sergeant
was stepping none too lightly he constantly
nodded his head up and down shaking his
mane tossing the bit in his mouth

 now the band swung into a waltz a roar
of approval shook the stand the loudspeaker
announced the start of the trick riding con-
test ruth ann darts name was given as the
first contestant

 tickling sergeant with her spurs she
started at an easy lope down the arena
toward the stand at once it became appar-
ent that the sorrel was afraid a piece of
white paper made him shy which indicated
that sergeants mind would never remain
on the schooling ruth ann had given him
she was forced to apply spurs to get the
pony loping again

as she passed the grandstand she took
her hat and waved it at the crowd the
applause again made sergeant shy ruth
ann halted at the far end of the arena then
spurred the pony for the return trip her
first stunt was to stand in the saddle with
the toes of her boots snugged under two
straps fastened to the hull near the root of
the saddle tree it was very important that
sergeant maintain a steady stride

 ruth ann drew herself up in the saddle
and thrust one boot into the toe strap for
the first time she knew cold fear if ser-
geant should misbehave she might be killed
or crippled for life sergeant was loping
steadily the girl took a chance and thrust
her other toe into the saddle strap then
stood up straight allowing her body to sway
with the rhythm of the horse

 now sergeant was approaching the grand-
stand ruth ann removed her white stetson
and started to wave it a roar of applause
started sergeant broke stride he almost
pitched the girl over his head had she not
been waiting for just such a thing she surely
would have had a dreadful accident but
her knees flexed and she came down into the
saddle with speed catching at the pommel
with both hands

 her hat was lost ruth ann tried des-
perately to hide the truth of sergeants error
from the spectators but she couldnt fool the
	exciting

judges her hat went rolling across the track
like a lost dogie clamoring for attention
ruth ann swung her leg over the saddle
horn and tried to finish out her first trick
by riding backwards though the crowd
applauded she knew she was through for
the day

  sergeant had failed her she would never
be able to try any of her dangerous stunts on
a shying pony

  ruth arm rode on down the arena and into
the corral

  tough luck cowgirl one puncher called
to her ill get your hat

  were sorry partner a girl performer
came up to say youre sure wise not to
continue on that sorrel we could speak to
the judges and get you another chance on
my bronc

  no ruth ann replied stoutly i only
want sergeant and he is not to be blamed

  it was not until she had unsaddled her sor-
rel and fastened a nosebag of oats to its
head that ruth ann took complete stock of
the situation she had hoped for a share of
the prize money that day it would have
tided her and her father over for another
year until their small herd of stock was ready
for market but now there would be noth-
ing but hard times in prospect for them

  as she thought of the buckboard accident
she walked over to the corral gate and
glanced at the chutes where the bucking
horse riders were getting ready for their
event she saw dave stewart talking with
several rodeo officials there seemed to be an
argument going on curly lambert soon
walked up he turned on his new rider with
clenched fists the rodeo officials stepped be-
tween them then curly stalked off mad as
a hornet

  i hope something happened to him to spoil
his plans the way his tough punchers spoiled
my plans ruth ann said aloud and she
turned to watch the trick riding before the
grandstand

  it was hard to watch the contest through
for the contestants were doing the very things
that ruth ann had practised so long and
she had had some new stunts that would have
opened their eyes discouraged she went
back to sit on an upturned water bucket near
her sorrel

  the blare of the distant brass band told
her that the trick riding exhibition was over
she heard the names of the winners then
the applause of the crowd the girl riders
started coming into the corral they were
so excited about the prizes that they forgot
all about ruth ann

western

  the loudspeaker was again in operation
calling out the next event-the cowboys wild
horse riding contest with saddles

  theres been a program change folks
the announcer said through the loudspeaker
dave stewart a newcomer to our rodeo
will ride for the dart ranch instead of the
gun ranch the gun ranch has entered
needles burke in place of dave stewart
ruth ann sprang to her feet
what was that she- cried did the
announcer say that dave stewart was riding
for my outfit its a mistake

  at that moment a rodeo official walked into
the corral he only heard part of the ques-
tion which ruth ann put to her friends the
tall man with the official badge on his chest
walked over to the girl

  miss dart i thought that dave stewart
spoke to you before making the change be-
tween ranches the official said he told us
that the gun ranch had been responsible for
injuring your pony so it was only fair for the
outfit to make up the prize money to you by
his ride-if he wins

  i dont want any prize money from the
gun ranch ruth ann insisted desperately
whats more i saw that curly lambert did
not approve of the program change

  theres nothing we can do about it now
the official replied stewart has already
started on his ride youll have to argue
things out with him later

as the grandstand thundered with
shouts ruth ann looked through the
corral gate into the arena to see dave stewart
topping a vicious sunfishing bronc he rode
high wide and handsome his waving ten-
gallon hat was in his left hand while his
right fingers held the halter rope with each
crashing jump of the wild horse stewart
scratched the animal with his spurs

  the strange puncher was an expert there
was no doubt about it and the rodeo throng
knew it and accorded him his just applause
the jolting wild bronc could not shake him
loose as it bucked clear across the arena

  the three-minute gong clanged and two
pick-up men rode out to take stewart off
the back of the plunging cayuse swiftly he
changed from his saddle to the back of a pick-
up horse and the wild horse went plunging
away without his rider

  what a ride cried the rodeo official
the prize is in the bag for dave stewart
youre lucky miss dart

  not as lucky as you think ruth ann
answered for she could see curly lambert
slipping between the rails of the corral
trouble

  may i speak to you a moment girlie
lambert called out his mouth twisting in a
sheepish smile i want to talk about your
sorrel pony

  ruth ann walked across the corral and
confronted the gun ranch boss

  do i have to thank you for dave stew-
arts ride and prize money ruth ann
asked her blue eyes flashing if that is the
case you are wrong curly lambert because
im accepting no favors from you

  i had nothing to do with stewart riding
for your ranch lambert answered suavely
me and stewart had a little argument so he
quit my outfit he wanted to ride in the
show but he could only to do it by riding
for a ranch in these parts it was too late to
enter the contest as an independent per-
former i just wanted to tell you that he
took a ride with your dart ranch to get into
the show

  is that all you have to say ruth ann
demanded suspecting that lambert had not
only come to the corral to tell her about
stewart

  dont be so panicky ruth ann the gun
ranch boss said reaching out to take her
hand you know darned well that im
plumb in love with you i want to marry
you im so sorry about what happened to-
day that ill buy that sorrel pony for top
price

  ruth ann yanked her hand away

  youll never buy me or my sorrel she
cried sharply you cant bribe me you know
how badly pa and i needed the prize money
if you think i would sell sergeant to you
youre crazy

  now wait a minute girlie lambert
interrupted you dont have to sell ser-
geant you marry me and youll be able
to keep the pony ill tide bill dart over
with some breeding stock for the rodeo cir-
cuit for a poor girl you certainly have
uppity ideas

  at that moment dave stewart strode up in
his batwing chaps

  he stopped the words of retort on ruth
anns lips

  miss dart i couldnt speak to you before
the ride but i want to say that the prize
money is yours stewart said glancing at
curly lambert im well paid by getting a
blue ribbon thats all i wanted

  thats what you say curly lambert
flared up fists clenching you hired out to
me stewart and then you quit at the last
moment im not forgetting that whats
more im telling you to keep away from this
girl or put a gun on your hip

brewing	

  ruth anns dislike for curly lambert in-
creased

  ill choose my companions mr lambert
she said coldly who they are is none of
your business she turned to dave stewart
i am sorry that i cant accept the prize
money but i want you to know that i am
grateful

  dave stewart grinned at curly lambert
then turned to ruth ann as if the gun
ranch boss no longer counted

  no need to be grateful for something you
dont accept miss dart stewart said im
looking for a job id be powerful obliged
to you if i could work at the dart outfit
if you wont take the prize money how
about letting me work out the same amount
of cash

  ruth anns eyes caught the sudden swing
of curly lamberts fist the gun ranch
boss was stepping in to smash stewart be-
hind the ear she cried out in alarm she
didnt think that dave stewart was aware
of the danger but the strange puncher was
no fool stewart had evidently expected
foul play he had been watching curly
lamberts shadow he ducked and the fist
of the gun ranch owner sailed over his
head

 then the cowboy came bobbing up and
his fist swung in an uppercut which caught
the unbalanced curly lambert flush on the
jaw lamberts eyes bulged his face turned
deathly pale as he staggered back he fell
backward and lay still in the dirt of the
corral

  dave stewart chuckled turned to ruth
ann and presented his arm

  now if you will allow me i will take you
to the grandstand to see the rest of the rodeo
we might have supper together later on and
talk over that proposition im sure stuck on
that sorrel pony of yours ruth ann its
almost as pretty as you

hile ruth anns acceptance of dave
stewarts invitation might have been
for the purpose of showing curly lambert
exactly how she felt it had another result

  dave stewart was not a greenhorn bronc
stomper with ambitions to become a pro-
fessional rodeo rider he was a skilled horse-
man who had wandered far and wide break-
ing broncs for ranchers curly lambert had
hired him to break a horse string and upon
seeing stewarts prowess lambert had
entered stewart in the rodeo to win local
honors for the gun ranch lambert evi-
dently suspected stewarts charm and that
was why the gun ranch boss had been so
	exciting

eager to keep the puncher away from ruth
ann

  at supper in the pecos hotel after ruth
ann had called at the doctors cabin and
found her father comfortably resting on a
divan the girl soon discovered dave stew-
arts winning personality he knew exactly
how to play the gallant host he ordered a
beautiful dinner and saw that it was properly
served there was an orchestra in the hotel
lounge to entertain the rodeo guests and
dave stewart suggested a dance

  once in his arms ruth ann knew she had
met a real dance partner stewart soon
taught her a new step and before long all
the eyes of the guests were upon them tall
and graceful stewart guided her about the
dance floor he made no attempt to put his
cheek against hers but ruth ann felt a cer-
tain possessiveness tingling from his arms
into her being

  when they had sat down at the table
again dave stewart regarded her for a long
moment

  is it a deal he asked her finally ill
work out that prize money as a hand on your
ranch it would keep me close to rodeo
stock from what ive learned in this town
your father has some fine bucking broncs
and wild steers that he is breeding for
rodeos i could learn a lot by tending them

  ruth ann drew a deep breath from the
doctor that afternoon she had learned that
her father was in no condition to do any
hard work evidently dave stewart didnt
know how small the dart ranch was he
would have to do many chores humiliating
to a cowboy but ruth ann could not bring
herself to refuse dave stewart if she did
he might ride out of pecos and out of her
life forever

  perhaps you had better drive out to the
ranch this evening with pa and me she
said seriously then well make up our
minds after you have seen how things are

  thats the stuff stewart exclaimed a
light in his blue eyes and now how about
another dance before the ice cream is
served

  it was late that evening before the buck-
board which had overturned in the main
street was repaired and the trip to the dart
ranch commenced when ruth ann and
dave stewart drove to the doctors cabin to
get bill dart the rancher had to be carried
out to the wagon box on the long drive over
the plains and hills bill dart slept peace-
fully on straw packed in the rig ruth ann
and her new puncher sat side by side in the
moonlight while the team clopped easily

western

along the trail sergeant followed the rig

  the next day at the dart ranch dave
stewart announced his intention of remain-
ing there was no arguing with the tall blue-
eyed cowboy he took charge of the chores
as if he were a member of the family and
ruth ann centered her attention upon the
kitchen determined to make the best of the
small larder

  the only person who seemed worried was
bill dart his bad leg required rest he
lay on a cot his eyes upon the ceiling think-
ing hard when ruth ann came in to bring
him a hot cup of tea bills irritation ex-
ploded

  just an invalid he exclaimed im no
good to anybody thats what comes of sow-
ing wild oats on the rodeo circuit i should
have spent my time building a ranch and
now youve gone and fallen in love with an
hombre who wants to follow the circuit and
you want to become a rodeo star

  pa ruth ann answered reproachfully
im not in love with anyone im only
interested in training sergeant into the best
trick pony in the world dave stewart is
only trying to do what is fair he won the
prize money because he was riding for our
outfit

  pish posh bill dart retorted hes
here because hes in love with you he cut
out curly lambert and theres going to be
trouble you mark my words girl lambert
is no man to take this lying down

  you are just making up stories to frighten
me ruth ann answered and she left the
room

  but bill dart was not making up stories
he knew a great deal about curly lambert
darts ranch was about to compete with the
gun ranch in the sale of rodeo stock bill
dart realized that the gun ranch boss did
not look upon this competition with favor
the only reason that lambert had allowed
the dart ranch to exist next to the gun
ranch had been that lambert expected to
acquire it by marrying ruth ann

wt ow with dave stewart lending a hand
at the dart ranch lambert almost
certainly would start moving behind the
scenes

  it was not a week after dave stewart took
charge of the range that the local banker
from pecos drove up in a surrey small and
wiry wearing gold-rimmed glasses perched
on a red hook of a nose harry p sutton
climbed down from his rig climbed the
steps of the dart veranda and knocked on the
front door ruth ann had heard the arrival
trouble brewing



of the surrey she conducted sutton into
the living room of the ranchhouse where bill
dart was reclining in a big morris chair

  jest thought id call to see how you are
bill sutton began rubbing his scrawny
hands together theres talk in town that
you got a stranger working for you
thats right sutton bill dart replied
with a frown are you getting worried
about the money i owe you

  no not that bill sutton answered
glancing nervously at ruth ann i figure
youll be able to pay up the installment on the
loan next month just like you always do
but i was wondering how you could pay

  well the sheriff in town has got a warn-
ing from the cattle association to be on the
watch for an hombre who looks like dave
stewart his real name is don stalling
sutton answered hes tall and has blue
eyes and is powerful handsome with the
ladies he gets hired on ranches because hes
a champ bronc rider then the next thing
you know cattle begins to vanish

  bill dart flashed a trouble glance at his
golden-haired daughter ruth ann stood
taut and defiant

  if thats all you came to say then you
can leave mr sutton she said coldly i
dont think dave stewart is the man that

murder and robbery stalk

a complete navajo raine novelet coming next issue

that puncher high bronc-stomping wages at
the same time

  ruth ann interrupted sutton

  thats our private business mr sutton
she said

  certainly it is your private business miss
dart the banker said quickly i never
meddle in how a man runs his outfit and i
know you aim to sell off a small herd of
rodeo stock to meet the loan but what im
driving at is different theres talk in pecos
that this young puncher who calls himself
dave stewart is really somebody else
what do you mean by that sutton bill
dart demanded

  well folks are saying that this dave
stewart is a border hopper bill the banker
said smoothly you know what that signi-
fies they think he has been mixed up with
rustling texas cattle across the rio grande
what proof have you got ruth ann
demanded

the sheriff is looking for

  dont take no offense miss dart sut-
ton pleaded i dont mean no harm i just
wanted to make sure that everything was
all right out here i got obligations to meet
next month and ill be waiting for the next
installment on the loan

  with this veiled warning the banker
turned out the door and climbed into the
surrey and drove off in a cloud of dust

  curly lambert sent that horrible penny-
pincher out here to worry us ruth ann
told bill dart curly owns a big share of
the bank you know that dad i wouldnt
pay any attention to suttons false alarm
bill dart nodded he closed his eyes and
lay back in the morris chair but he was
troubled he knew that young buckaroos
didnt work for nothing dave stewart was
too wise a man to waste time with a small
outfit when he could be drawing top wages
	exciting

with curly lambert or some other big
ranch was there a chance that stewarts
interest in ruth ann was only a ruse

  bill dart spent the rest of the day trying
to find the answer

  ruth ann put on her frontier breeches and
an attractive blouse that afternoon she sad-
dled sergeant at the corral and rode down
the range to the antelope creek pasture to
talk with dave stewart

  she found him collecting stray stock from
the surrounding gullies and timber to make
a sale herd

  stewart waved his hat and came on the
gallop to meet her

  it sure is a welcome relief from work
ruth ann the puncher greeted her ive
been hoping all morning that you would pay
a visit and id almost given up

  ruth ann studied the tall rider seriously
dave dont you think it would be better
to move this stock up closer to the ranch-
house she said in a week well have to
take it to town and i dont want anything
to happen to it

  nothing can happen to it ruth ann
stewart assured her there is better graz-
ing here you want the stock in the best of
condition when it goes to the rodeo market
that means a lot to the buyers its quite
safe down here he paused lets ride up
on yonder knoll in the shade i want to talk
to you about something thats on my mind
what is it about ruth ann asked nerv-
ously

  its about your sorrel pony dave stew-
art answered with a flush which made his
face handsomer than ever

ruth ann rode stirrup-to-stirrup with
the bronc stomper up the grade to a
lovely knoll they dismounted and stood
looking at each other ruth ann felt warm
blood rise to her cheeks they were so much
alone in the great open world it had taken
time for them to get acquainted and the
odd part of this relationship was that they
were more embarrassed than they had been
before

  yes dave ruth ann said what was
it about sergeant

  i was thinking that hed make the finest
trick horse in the world dave stewart said
nervously but thats not all its you ruth
ann ive wandered around an awful lot
looking for somebody like you

 no dave ruth ann was distressed
you mustnt start saying things you and i
will regret

  but i cant help it stewart exclaimed

western

he stepped forward and took ruth ann in
his arms

  she tried to hold him off but she couldnt
a great happiness suddenly welled up from
within her like an intoxicating flood and all
thoughts of resistance vanished as she was
drawn into the bronc stompers arms she
felt as if she had always belonged there his
lips dropped to hers and ruth ann gave him
back the warmth of her fresh sweet kiss
for long they stood holding each other tight-
ly and then within ruth anns heart was
born a tiny pain that telegraphed a warning
to her mind

  she drew back

  no dave it is not fair she protested
this is something i didnt want to happen
we mustnt-we mustnt

  dave stewart refused to let her go

 im in love with you ruth ann he
pleaded i knew it from the first time i
saw you in pecos you must understand
that its the reason im here im through
with wandering

  ruth ann broke from his arms

 from wandering where dave she
asked flushing from wandering along the
rio grande from the united states to mex-
ico oh dave who are you and what are
you really doing here

  dave stewart tensed

 what do you mean by that ruth ann
why should you mention the border who
has been talking to you

  ruth ann turned to her sorrel pony
you are worried dave she said ancr she
swung to the saddle as he leaped forward to
help her but she mounted by herself i
think you had better make up your mind to
tell me the truth about your life dave

 it was curly lambert dave stewart
exclaimed he said something to you you
have seen him again

  ruth ann only tightened the reins and
galloped away

  when she returned to the ranchhouse she
found bill dart hobbling about the living
room collecting papers

  what did you find out the dart owner
asked

  ruth anns jaw set stubbornly

  i didnt find out anything dad she said
tartly but you can bet curly lambert is
behind all this business dave stewart is no
outlaw he is not wanted by the sheriff if
he is why doesnt the sheriff ride out here
and arrest him

  i dont know bill dart answered but
i do know that sutton has already dunned
us for his loan and that looks bad we bet-
trouble

ter get that herd to pecos as soon as we
can

  is that why you got up from the chair
ruth ann asked you can just go back to
resting again

  im taking orders from nobody bill dart
answered stubbornly this outfit needs a
boss and im nominated

  ruth ann went on to the kitchen to pre-
pare the vegetables for dinner she knew
there was little use in arguing with bill dart
he would do just as he pleased

  that evening when dave stewart rode in
for supper bill dart said nothing about the
bankers visit to the ranchhouse ruth ann
maintained a strict dignity stewart himself
was reserved the meal passed with very
little conversation it was obvious that there
was tension in the air

  i reckon ill take a little ride into pecos
dave stewart said getting up from the table
i wont be back until late so dont get wor-
ried if you dont see a light in the bunk-
house

  through a window ruth ann watched him
ride off on his big black cayuse she didnt
know but that he was going for good if
such was the case it was best for her

she went to bed early and lay tossing
for hours the silvery beams filtering
through the lace curtains at her window kept
reminding her of the moonlight ride home
in the repaired buckboard from the rodeo
when dave stewart had sat beside her and
bill dart had been asleep in the wagon box
on a pile of straw never until then had
ruth ann known such quiet peacefulness
now all the fear of life had returned

  she slept fitfully along toward dawn and
she was up early to prepare breakfast bill
dart was out of bed as soon as the scent of
coffee permeated the ranchhouse he hob-
bled out on to the porch and banged the big
steel ring that served as a dinner bell

 dave stewart did not answer the sum-
mons

  bill dart hobbled down to the bunk house
he returned with a serious face

 he never came back from pecos the
rancher snapped i reckon hes flown the
coop

  a terrible fear assailed ruth ann she
hurriedly gulped down her oatmeal and cof-
fee and without waiting for wheatcakes she
went out to tiie barn and saddled sergeant
then she mounted at once and galloped down
to the antelope creek pasture

  the dart herd was gone

  no wonder dave stewart didnt want to

brewing	

bring the stock up near the ranchhouse
ruth ann cried he stole it last night

  on the ride back to the ranch headquar-
ters ruth ann didnt know what she would
say to her father it was because of her that
bill dart had trusted dave stewart yet
ruth ann herself could not believe that the
bronc stomper had turned so treacherously
upon the darts she couldnt forget the look
in his eyes the afternoon before when he
had held her in his arms and told her that
he loved her

  had she not resisted had she told him
that he had won her heart he might not
have gone back to his old ways he might
have reformed but now it was too late

 the sale herd was gone and bill dart
stood to lose his ranch

  ill sell sergeant ruth ann decided
brushing tears from her eyes it is the only
way that pa can meet the installment on his
loan ive got to do it ill have to sell ser-
geant to curly lambert

  bill dart was standing on the ranchhouse
veranda with the aid of a cane when ruth
ann rode up the scowl on her fathers face
told her that he suspected the worst as
ruth ann dismounted he tried to smile

  dont tell me partner he called to her
i can figure what happened but we arent
licked yet ive put my faith in men before
and found them wanting

  but it took a great deal of arguing to con-
vince bill dart that sergeant had to be sacri-
ficed in fact it took the entire day bill
dart himself couldnt help wandering out to
the ranchhouse veranda and looking at the
long road toward pecos as if he expected to
see the tall figure of dave stewart topping
a bronc in the distance

  at the supper table bill dart made an
announcement

  hitch up the buckboard partner he
said im going to take a little pasear into
pecos to talk with sutton mebbe i can stall
him off i dont want to see him at the bank
ill catch him at his home you stay here
and get a good nights rest

  you intend to find out if dave stewart
is in town ruth ann exclaimed i am
going with you

  no youre not bill dart snapped im
going alone this is a mans work hot a
girls

  ruth ann went out to the corral for the
team she was finished harnessing the span
of bays to the buckboard when bill dart
came limping across the ranch-yard using
his cane he was wearing his old black stet-
son and shabby dark blue suit he looked
	exciting

poorer than a church mouse and ruth ann
felt a deep anguish tear her heart

  good luck dad was all that she could
say when bill dart drove off

  she sat on the ranchhouse steps too worn
out to go in and clean up the supper plates
the shadows of night began to fall a hor-
rible loneliness swept her the moon was
early in rising this night just as its golden
rim was lifting above the horizon of the
plains ruth ann heard the thudding of
hoofs a rider was coming across the range

  ruth anns heart leaped she wanted to
call out but she held the name of dave
stewart on her lips

  she recognized him as soon as his big
bronc turned past the corral stewart came
right up to the ranchhouse he saw her and
he smiled

  howdy miss dart stewart said mock-
ingly swinging down from the saddle
wheres your father ive got business with
him

ruth ann wanted to leap up and flee
she didnt want to talk with this man
who had injured her so but she found her-
self speaking slowly and frigidly

  my father has gone to pecos to talk with
the banker if there is any explanation mr
stewart you can make it to me

  dave stewart jingled in his spurse toward
her and she saw that there was a six-gun
strapped low to his thigh

  bill has gone to town he exclaimed
thats the worst possible thing he could do
theyll be waiting for him

  who will be waiting for him ruth ann
asked in alarm

  the rustlers stewart replied they
tried to stop me last night get your gun
ruth ann weve got to help him

  ruth ann jumped to her feet

  but you must explain she cried what
are you talking about

  no time to explain now stewart re-
plied turning to run toward the bam ill
get sergeant saddled

  ruth ann turned into the house for her
hat and gauntlets stewart had told her to
get a gun dazed she went into bill darts
room for the cartridge belt and holstered 
that her father always kept hanging above
his bureau the weapon was gone

  evidently bill dart had expected trouble
for he never took his six-gun to town ruth
ann wasted no time in trying to solve the
mystery which had been suddenly thrust up-
on her she ran to her own room and picked
up a light hunting rifle then met dave stew-

western

art before the ranchhouse he was mounted
on his own big black horse sergeant was
waiting ruth ann swung to the saddle and
they started off on the gallop toward pecos

  what has happened dave ruth ann
called out to him you must tell me

  the sale herd was rustled last night
dave stewart replied loudly when some-
body tried to bushwhack me on the road to
pecos i suspected the worst and rode to the
antelope creek pasture but i was too late
to stop the theft

  then it wasnt you who did it ruth
ann said to herself

  but dave stewart had sensed what she
was thinking a hard frown creased his brow
he didnt look at her his quirt went to the
flanks of his bronc and the animal began to
leave sergeant behind ruth ann bent over
the saddle hom using her own quirt on her
sorrel to catch up

  bill dart had a good hours start on the
road to town but he would drive at a slow
trot dave stewart and ruth ann pressed
their saddle ponies breaking their gallop
only while climbing the hills the trail ahead
was bathed in moonlight where the pair
crossed open range in the hills the road
was laced with dark tree shadows

  a dozen times ruth ann told herself that
they would never overtake her father but
dave stewart kept spurring onward now
and then rising in the stirrups as if he could
see througn the dark ruth ann herself
tried to catch the distant squeak of buck-
board wheels above the pounding of their
saddle ponies

  then quite suddenly far ahead both ruth
ann and dave stewart caught a flash of light
in the dark they tensed listening and to
their ears came the echo of a gun shot
their spurs went to their broncs ruth ann
saw the stomper draw the six-gun on his
thigh as they raced on fearing the worst
they saw another flash of light then another
their horses hoofs muffled the sound of the
firing

  the shots had been a mile away the
ranch girl and the bronc stomper covered
that distance in record time again and
again they spied the telltale flash of guns
and now they could hear the reports quite
plainly

  keep back dave stewart cried out and
he spurred his black cayuse into the lead

  sergeant was a trick bronc not a racer
though ruth ann used a quirt on her sor-
rel stewarts powerful mount steadily left
the smaller horse behind stewart was rid-
ing right into the thick of the fight ruth
ann saw him rise up in his stirrups throw-
ing his gun into aim

  then he spied a buckboard overturned
beside the road the team had broken out
of the traces and was not around at first
glance there was nobody near the rig but
a chorus of yells from the brush beside the
trail told her that men were hiding there
and suddenly dave stewarts weapon was
blasting bullets into the rocks and grease-
woods

  at the same time a familiar voice shouted
in the night

  give it to em cowboy theyve got him
holed up over here in the trees

  it was bill dart shouting to dave stewart

hastily ruth ann threw her rifle to
her shoulder and sent a shot into the
brush to the right of the trail where men
were now threshing through the branches to
escape stewart was shooting too ruth
ann heard a yelp of agony the bronc
stomper drove his bronc into the grease-
woods and vanished in the night in hot pur-
suit of the foe

  as stewart disappeared a man in a black
silk shirt and chaps ducked out from behind
a big boulder farther down the trail de-
spite the fact that the night hid his features
ruth ann recognized the big-shouldered fig-
ure of curly lambert there was a rifle in
lamberts hand but he was intent on get-
ting away

  curly ruth ann cried and she kept
her pony galloping toward him

  it aint curly the voice of lambert
badly disguised floated back keep away
from me or ill shoot

  then without warning dave stewarts big
black horse came leaping out of the grease-
woods beside the road stewart evidently
had heard the death warning curly lam-
bert whirled to throw up his rifle and shoot
but stewarts six-gun blasted flame-split
thunder and curly lambert pitched his
length in the road

  dragging her sorrel to a halt ruth ann
swung down from the saddle and bent over
the shuddering form of curly lambert a
dark wet pool was forming on his shirt front
his lips were drawn back from his teeth

  how did you find out curly lambert
breathed in pain i could have got away
with it if it hadnt been for that bronc
stomper

dave stewart came up and drew ruth

  eager to help in every way to cut- down
the coyote numbers that have reached al-
most alarming proportions in some districts
game officials have given out bait pointers
for trappers best bait they say is poisoned
pork fat the coyotes seem to relish it more
important it disintegrates in a reasonable
length of time after being set out

  lean meat on the other hand will dry out
then along comes a rain the meat swells
with the moisture and a pet dog or some
other domestic animal tries the poison-laden
morsel and gets killed

  figures show that last year in texas some
 pounds of fat were used by texas game
commission to provide about  poison
baits

bounty for coyotes

  the estimated kill was between  and
 coyotes nevertheless so bad has the
coyote menace become ih some areas that
locally counties have been authorized to pay
up to  bounty for the animals as preda-
tors a few of the bigger ranchers that have
been special sufferers have hired trappers
to rid them of the pest one south texas
ranch reported a single hired trapper on the
ranch caught more than  coyotes in three
weeks

 dont know whether that is a record or
not but the trapper did well both for his
boss and himself in addition to the value
of the pelts he received a bounty of from
 to  per coyote

  elsewhere in the west particularly in the
open desert country coyotes have been hunt-
ed and gunned from airplanes in addition to
being trapped or killed by poison bait for
the bounty on them as predators

  bobcats too have been on the increase as
have mountain lions in the wild mountain
country of arizona beaver are coming back
throughout much of the trapping country

 the increase in the more commonly
trapped valuable fur-bearers is proportion-
ate mink muskrats skunks and coons have
all experienced a wartime respite from the
trappers inroads like a ripe crop the
resultant surplus is ready to be harvested

 along the salmon river in idaho-famous
river-of-no-return-are hills blanketed
with snow in the wintertime where bobcats
may be trapped in the canyon and foxes
caught in the higher elevations its coyote
country too

 there are mink and muskrats along many
of the lesser known creeks and tributary
streams that should afford trappers a hand-
some seasons catch or a chance to lay out
a trapline that will provide work for years

in the same category of increased wildlife
population are the trappers mountain haunts
in the pacific northwest states of oregon
and washington

the far places

the experienced trapper who knows the
ropes and wants to tackle the far places might
do well in alaska but he should remember
before he plans the trip that a non-resident
trapping license will set him back  and
it is necessary that he reside within the
territory for three years before he can be-
come eligible for the more nominal resident
trapping license

northern canada is good trapping coun-
try and has been ever since the earliest days
of the famous hudsons bay company but
it is necessary to become a british subject
and a resident of canada before you can trap
there

there is no need however to go so far
afield in fact the part time trapper can set
his traps for the two most common fur-bear-
ers muskrats and skunks most anywhere in
the country where the animals are found
and make anything from a pin money catch
up to sizable winter earnings as many a
farmer or farm boy already knows

marshes ponds and the banks of slow mov-
ing streams are the muskrats favorite habi-
tat it is there they build their peculiar
dome-shaped dens out of the reeds and
sticks and water grasses found nearby
swamp flags and reed grass provide them
with cover and food though they will also
eat mussels crayfish and sometimes catfish

along streams muskrats usually build
their dens in low overhanging grass-cov-
ered banks the den entrances may be just
at the edge of or below the water line

trapped in winter

muskrats are trapped in winter when their
fur is prime a popular set for bank muskrat
dens is to place the trap just inside the den
entrance making sure there is enough room
for the rat to swim into it the stake should
be set out the full length of the chain in
water deep enough to drown a trapped rat
quickly

if local or state game laws permit the
practice marsh and pond rats may be
trapped by setting the traps on the sides
of the built-up muskrat house

otherwise they may be caught by trap sets
placed strategically in the trails they make
through the swamp grasses or along slides
and paths formed by their passage to and
from the water a number  trap the same

 size trap as used for skunks mink and wea-
 sels will hold a muskrat in a drowning set
 this trap has a  inch draw spread

a million-dollar crop

   out here in texas some  persons do a
 little or a lot of trapping each year and the
 value of the crop they obtain runs close to a
 million dollars annually

   from point of numbers caught the prin-
 cipal fur-bearers are possum skunk musk-
 rat and coon fox and mink as well as coy-
 otes are also trapped by the thousands every
 year

   texas muskrat run in three species the
 louisiana rat found in southeast texas in
 the country back of beaumont the pecos
 river muskrat and the panhandle sections
 great plains muskrat

   mink are trapped in the wooded regions
 and watered thickets of east texas beaver
 are found in the state the broad-tail beaver
 ranges along the rio grande and devils
 river

  once widely distributed and heavily
 trapped the animal known as the texas
 beaver is now rare it is found only in a few
 special localities notably on the llano river
 and in polk county

bobcats are caught in the wooded country

he deputy of apache butte looked at two
powerfully unusual hombres standing at
his desk and with a shiver of agony he
remembered them the lanky visitor with
the long tired face sad eyes and wide mouth
was tombstone jones the other gent
was a shrunken copy of tombstone except
that he was trying hard to grow a mustache
he was speedy smith

  how come you fellers drifted down here
deputy stormy knight inquired with mis-
givings

well ill tell yuh stormy said tomb-
stone we heard theres a good reward for
the red mask so we come down to git it
that the law man pointed out aint
nothin to joke about

  is he bad asked speedy curiously
hes plenty bad the deputy sheriff re-
plied he stuck up the bank at saguero
flats shot the cashier and got away with
a good haul hes stuck up the stage between
here and saguero flats twice once he got
a shipment of money for the bank here and
the last time he got the payroll of one of the
mines he also killed a spangler the guard
he stuck up don ellis a cowboy from the
broken shoe and j harrison cartwright
the owner when they was cornin from
saguero flats in a buckboard don didnt
have moren a couple dollars but cartwright
had a few hundred a good watch and a
diamond ring my my was he mad

  the red mask was asked tombstone
no the new owner of the broken shoe
the law man replied angrily cartwright
said he was goin to have the best detective

mask he swore all kinds of punishment

  thank you stormy tombstone said
grinning from ear to ear

  for tombstone and speedy were the best
detectives on earth sent to apache butte
to corral the coyote who wore a red mask
and thus the next issue of exciting
western begins another side-splitting
novel by w c tuttle about those two hair-
raising favorites tombstone and speedy

 coyote luck for tombstone is
the title of this featured opus in which our
cpa pards run into as loco a situation as
they ever encountered in their whacky wan-
derings this time they make a short over-
night visit to mexico and return with a cap-
tive-which is plumb against the law for
theyve got no right to drag a gent across
the border without a lot of papers signed by
united states and mexican officials

  just where did you arrest this poco hom-
bre tombstone deputy stormy knight
asks with qualms knowing full well that the
cpa man did the job down in mexico
where tombstone had no right to arrest any-
body

  where tombstone asks keeping a
straight face well i-uh-this country im
talkin about is awful strange to me deputy

  i sec says knight well its all right
but as a matter of fact i dont believe any of
you

  you mean it dont sound good tomb-
stone asks im tellin yuh that me an
speedy went to agua verde in mexico just
to look around we et supper in a little cafe
an we ordered steaks my piece o meat was
cut off the left hip of the cow critter which
had been branded pretty deep right there
on my plate was the broken shoe brand as
plain as yuh please

  i asked the cook where-at he buys such
de-licious meat an he tells me he buys it
all from poco aguilar we find the two
gents thats missin oscar an angel an all
four of us went to pocos corral which we
finds full of stolen broken shoe cows we
get our broncs and opened the gate intend-
in to take back what poco borrowed but
we aint moren got goin well until here
comes poco an about a hundred of his rough
compadres

  i yells to the boys tombstone continued
his strange narration an says take them
cows to the border boys ill hold back
pocos men for yuh well sir i laid back and
swapped shots with that army until i drives
em all to cover but as soon as i start on
here comes the remnants of that army agin
it was like that all the way to the border
and poco is the only survivor to reach it

  the boys have got the cows across the
line by that time when me an poco git
together our guns are empty an we lock
in mortal combat it was a case of truth
agin corruption-and truth won which it
alius does i knocked poco down seven or
eight times and the last time he fell on our
side of the border so i took him

  at least thats tombstones explanation
and its a mighty good one if you ask us
just as everything else he does is sure-fire
entertainment and the best of reading and
coyote luck for tombstone hits
the target every single shot so long as
tombstone and speedy are doing the shoot-
ing its a howler for the must list

  another favorite character navajo tom
raine the arizona territorial ranger fol-
lows tombstone and speedy in the next issue
of exciting western in a powder-
exploding novelet by jackson cole entitled
ranger on the run

  its a tale packed with thrills from the
moment navajo walks into a beanery and a
knock-down-drag-out scrap with strangers
puzzled over why these men should want to
kill him the ranger starts an investigation
that leads him down under the earth into a
complicated maze of abandoned mining tun-
nels under the old town ranger on the
run is full of surprises and crammed with
action
 here is a small sample

 navajo raine stepped out from behind the
shoulder of stone he came down the tunnel
like a tall shadow his moccasins making no
sound he stepped ten feet behind the three men
who were all watching the senseless girl closely
for signs of revival

  need some help raines voice was a somber
sound in the tunnel

  bill yeager and his two hirelings whirled
their eyes goggling at the tall ranger who stood
there brown face wooden green eyes narrow
bright slits that watched them alertly the lamp-
light struck dancing highlights from the tur-
quoise grips of raines guns and from the white
teeth that flashed between lips that grinned
without mirth

  raine bill yeager said and his voice came
back in hollow echoes as if the tomb itself were
mocking him

  you three are under arrest for robbin two
stages of gold bullion and murderin a shotgun
guard and stage driver durin each of the two
robberies raine intoned coldly

  kill the hellion nate pearsons nasal voice
screamed if we dont blast him down-

  but as raine had already guessed fat lew
castle was the deadliest of the trio castles
moon face was grinning his pale gray eyes wide
and innocent looking when his pudgy hands
blurred to his side

  navajo raines hands moved too yet his guns
were just clearing leather when lew castles
six-shooter threw thunder along the tunnel

 a new alamo paige story about the pony
express by reeve walker will be at the head

a group of cavalrymen beleagured by an
indian war party and his job is to deliver a
letter pleading for reinforcements

might send an opinion on the subject wed
be powerful happy to hear from you

  another reader doesnt feel quite the way
mr barnett does

  thunder river valley sold me the first ex-
citing western i ever read w c tuttle is a
western writer i have read since  i notice that
real westerners like tuttles stories while a certain
mr hicks from boston doesnt well who cares i
find tombstone and speedy perfect i have read five
over and over and haunt the newsstands for the next
numbers-rosalie m eckerlein springfield mass

  and heres another readers opinion

   i have been reading the last issue of exciting
 western and enjoy it because i am fond of texas
 i enjoyed the old story no money-no water i
 like different stories as for tombstone jones and
 speedy smith they are pretty good-private otis
 allen v s army

  it sure is good to hear from the armed
services about our stories for those readers
are far from home and exciting west-
ern many times brings them right back to
the good old usa in their minds

   its a cinch that if you fans dont tell us
 what you like then the editor wont know
 what to print so get busy and drop a line
 to the editor exciting western 
 east  street new york  new york
 well be waiting to hear from you

  good-by now and thanks to everybody

ann back from the dying man down the
road bohind them bill dart was limping a
six-gun in his hand

   he tried to stop me on the road bill
dart called but i was watching out after
your warning dave i drove with a gun in
my hand and i shot at the first sign of trou-
ble i just managed to dive clear of the
buckboard when they started shooting at
me and i crawled away into the trees where
they couldnt find me

   ruth ann heard the death rattle in curly
lamberts throat she turned and dave
stewart folded her into his arms

   i trailed the stolen cattle to curly lam-
 berts range dave stewart explained as he
 held the girl tightly i wanted to force the
 gun ranch to come into the open so i left
 a note tacked to the corral fence that the
 cattle association knew what lambert was
 up to

  the cattle association ruth ann ex-
claimed do you mean that you are their
agent

   thats right dave stewart said im a
 detective for the ca lamberts rodeo stock
 bears some pretty funny brand marks and
 we were looking into it thats why i got a
 job with his spread and why i could afford
 to work for you but all that can wait dar-
 ling it looks as if i solved myself a much
 bigger problem

  what in tarnation is that bill dart
demanded

   dave stewarts lips were pressed against
ruth anns mouth and she forgot every-
thing except the clamor of her heart for
she knew what the bronc stomper meant
the problem that he had solved was to find
the one girl in the world
