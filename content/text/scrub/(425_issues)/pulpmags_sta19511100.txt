should any of you detect a strange hand
at the throttle it is more illusion than
fact the impress of merwin remains
like footsteps on the sands of time only gradual
erosion will wear them away actually the im-
minences of publishing being what they are
the stories in this issue and many to come were
long ago selected by my predecessor with only
a slight assist from me the only things imme-
diately different therefore are the departments
in which you may detect a certain wary fum-
bling like unto a spaceman stepping out upon
a new world and testing the atmosphere mean-
while keeping a weather eye out for concealed
mines booby traps and bems

grist for the mill

  as to stories policy and so forth-it is our
belief that a magazines policy is not something
that is cast and hardened in its mold overnight
it grows and evolves and changes with the
times to begin with well have only one policy
-to come as close as possible to having no
policy that is we propose to be as catholic
as possible in our fiction tastes everything will
be grist for the mill that qualifies as good
science-fiction

  we expect to be open to change and experi-
mentation for unlike any other form of liter-
ature the stf story  declines the moment it
freezes in form and refuses to experiment we
intend to keep broadening its base

fiction of the future

  fortunately the auguries are good stf has
displayed a vitality in contrast to other forms
of fiction which is heartening in a very real
sense stf is the fiction of the future and it
becomes increasingly so as it moves out of the
flash gordon class and begins to deal with the
essential universal human problems molded and
motivated by future conditions

that our authors have been able to anticipate



and predict future conditions in so many in-
stances is a credit to them a great number of
stories we have bought would have graced the
shiniest of slicks heinleins jerry was a
man in our opinion outclassed several of its
successors which ran in the satevepost and
few magazines anywhere have printed anything
as sheerly magnificent as kuttners dark
world and mask of circe

  science fiction therefore can be all things to
all men-escape reverie prediction or what
have you but its potentialities are still not
fully realized the form is not fixed it is aston-
ishingly fluid

  for example there has been little done in
the realm of the deductive stf story to be sure
frank belknap long has created a space detec-
tive and jack vance an interplanetary sleuth
known as magnus ridolph sold to the movies
incidentally but these were only a tentative
approach to a large and intriguing field

a foothold on reality

  the essential question which opens up here
is this what will crime be like in the future
and what will the methods of detection be like 
the answers are apt to be a type of stf story
with something of a new slant gimmicks yes
but a foothold on reality a tie to the present
and a reach into the future

  the same with any problem of human rela-
tionships what will the family of the future be
like the politics of the future our pet peeve
is the story which goes  years forward in
time and  back for its politics coming up
with kings dictators emperors or other mediae-
val systems complete even the odds bodikins
school of dialogue is adopted intact this is a
confusion oi the fairy tale with science-fiction
but there is a clear line between magic and fan-
tasy even if it gets very thin at times you
might say that no one expects a fairy tale to
have logic or even be reasonable whereas a
turn to page 
try it some time concentrate intently upon an-
oilier penon seated in a room with you without his
noticing it observe him gradually become restless and
finally turn and look in your direction simple-yet it is
e positive demonstration that thought generates a mental
energy which can be projected from your mind to the
consciousness of another do you realize how much of
your success and happiness in life depend upon your
influencing others is it not important to you to have
others understand your point of view-to be receptive to
vour proposals

retribution

by wallace west

maidez -   

  have just obtained the july issue of startling
and am highly pleased with cover illustrations and
the kind words of your blurb but   

   i hope that by this time you finally have stopped
sticking yourself full of late roman fibulae and
are contemplating buying me a lunch after that
blooper through which you confuse brownings
cliilde roland with byrons chiide harolde
tsk it jumped at me because i hunted high and
low through byron for that quote before finding it
where it belonged just please tell the gentle read-
ers i had it roland in copy

  incidentally i agree that byron could have 
and did    write some nice science fiction his
darkness would scare the pants off iskra-ral-
ston new jersey

  yeah further research reveals the romans
did have diaper-sized safety pins in the days of
the empire which does mean that mr hunt iu
 pulled a fast one on the patent office

  echoes of this brawl reached me faintly
through the sage and cactus all i can say is
that if west wants merwin to buy him a lunch
hell have to interrupt him at his labors he is
we hope currently writing like mad

  witch war is the best story you have pub-
lished in months matheson is a genius his talent
is truly unique lets have some more of his work
in fact lets have lots more off-trai work i get
so doggone tired of the same old stuff over and
over hooray for matheson etc

  can you tell me the name of an old story in
which a cat enters a casket and chews up a dead
man  it is a grisly yarn old as the proverbial hills
and i think ambrose bierce wrote it id like very
much to get the title and author so i can look it up

all this and browning too

by washington ch divan

dear sir

    with reference to the dark tower shame i

   it was not chiide harold it was chiide
roland i

    it was not lord byron it was robert brown-
ing i

and both byron and browning were sf fans
even though the term wasnt used in their time

    browning often visited my great grandfather
simpson s divan in london and the old gentle-
man wrote in his diary of the excited discussion
of a polmorph by his guests

    browning probably picked up his key line-quoted
in ss-from the third act of king lear that is
chiide roland to the dark tower came and
shakespeare in turn was referring to an old scotch
ballad about a hero named chiide rowland

outside of the above the dark tower was
super- fifteenth st n w wash d c

   a word in your ear monsieur it is bad
enough to make a small error in bibliography
but to have nearly everybody in the us point-
ing it out conies under the heading of cruel and
unusual punishment which is expressly forbid-
den by the constitution we dont say this is
why merwin left town but we do hope he is
having a good time out in the pastoral atmos-
phere of the mid-west

-and more

by jack c miske

dear mr merwin

    i thought you might like to know about the
erroneous nature of some of your remarks concern-
ing the source of the title of wallace wests story
the dark tower although youve probably al-
ready heard too much about the matter

    i think mr west got the phrase not from byrons
chiide harold as you suggested init from robert
brownings mucli shorter poem childt rolande to
the dark toiver came browning in turn seems
to have got it from edgars song as the close of
act three scene four of shakespeares king lear
where edgar feigning madness sings

    child rowland to the dark tower came

    his word was still fie fob and fum

    i smell the blood of a british man 

    incidentally byrons name prior to his tenth year
was properly george gordon byron after that
george gordon lord byron the correct title of
the poem you mentioned is chiide harolds pil-
grimage based on italian history it is a major

they watched him come on the thick
carpet kept saying hush-hush as his feet
swept over it the silence the watching
eyes the whispering of the carpet the

leaden weight of deep unspoken anx-

culiarly penetrating examination which
served only to enhance their manifest
uneasiness one or two fidgeted like men
who feel some of their certitude begin-
ning to evaporate each seemed secretly
relieved when the gaze passed on to hia
immediate neighbor

  in the end his attention went back to
the lion-maned oswald heraty who pre-
sided at the tables center the pupils
of his eyes shone and the irises were
flecked with silver as he looked at
heraty and spoke in slow measured un-
hurried tones

  he said captain david raven at
your service sir

  leaning back in his chair heraty
sighed fixed his worried stare upon the
immense crystal chandelier dangling
from the ceiling it was difficult to tell
whether he was marshaling his
thoughts or carefully avoiding the
others eyes or finding it necessary to
do the latter in order to achieve the
former other members of the council
now had their heads turned toward
heraty partly to give attention to what
he was about to say partly because to
look at heraty was not to look at raven
they had all watched ravens entrance
but none wanted to study him close up
none wanted to study him none wanted
to be studied by him

  still frowning at the chandelier
heraty spoke in the manner of one

shouldering an unwanted but immovable
burden we are at war

  the table waited there was only si-
lence

tteraty went on i address you vo-
 cally because i have no alternative
kindly respond in the same manner

  yes sir was ravens totally inade-
quate response

  we are at war heraty repeated
does that not surprise you

  no sir

  it ought to put in a council mem-
ber on heratys right he was a little
aggrieved by ravens lack of reaction
we have been at war for about
eighteen months and have only just dis-
covered the fact

  kindly leave this to me suggested
heraty silencing the speaker with an
impatient wave of one hand for an in-
stant-only an instant-he met ravens
eyes as he asked have you known or
suspected that we were actually at
war

  no sir

  surely you should have done

  i have not bothered to estimate the
probable time factor that we would be
involved in war some time or other was
obvious from the start

  from what start inquired the fat
man on the right

               flying saucers and other scare phenomena have given birth to the
             constantly recurring theory that perhaps superior intelligences from
             somewhere in space are keeping an anxious eye on mans development
             here on earth the complexion of this watching eye has ranged from
             the horribly inimical to the blandly protective youll remember ted

and settled another planet raven told
him he was disconcertingly imper-
turbable about it war then became in-
herent in the newly-created circum-
stances

  meaning we blundered

  not at all progress demands pay-
ment war is the price sooner or later
the bill is presented

  heraty took over again never mind
the past we as individuals had no con-
trol over that its our task to cope with
the present and the immediate future
he rubbed his chin said to raven
venus and mars are attacking us of-
ficially we can do a fat lot about it its
a war that isnt a war

  a difference of opinion raven
asked betraying the shadow of a smile

  it began with that now it has gone
a whole lot further theyve turned
from words to deeds without any for-
mal declaration of war-indeed with
every outward appearance of friendship
and blood-brotherhood-they are im-
plementing their policies in a military

rrturner theyve been at it for some-
thing like eighteen months and weve
only just discovered that were being
hit that sort of thing can go on too
long

  all wars go on too long raven ob-
served

  they viewed this as a profound
thought there was a faint murmur of
agreement and much nodding of heads
two of them went so far as to glance
straight at him though as briefly as pos-
sible

  the worst of it is continued
heraty morbidly that theyve got us
in a fix of our own devising and offi-
cially at any rate theres no way out
whats the answer to that he did not
wait for suggestions he provided an
answer himself we must take action
which is unofficial

  me being the goat inquired raven
you being the goat heraty con-
firmed

  for a moment the silence was heavy
while raven stood waiting politely and

watchers	

raven

the council occupied itself with various
thoughts there was plenty of food for
thought there had been wars before in
the far past the very far past some
slow and tortuous some swift and
bloody but they had all been earth-
wars a conflict between worlds was
something different and posed new
problems to which bygone lessons did
not apply moreover a new-style war
conducted with new weapons employ-
ing new techniques likewise posed
fresh problems not solvable on the
basis of past experience there was
nothing to go by other than the hard
facts of today

  after a while heraty said venus
and mars have long been settled by
homo sapiens our own kind our own
blood they are our children but no
longer see it that way they think
theyre grown up theyve been agitat-
ing for self-government for the last
couple of centuries theyve been de-
manding the key of the house while
theyre still damp from their christen-
ing weve refused their hearts desire
weve told them to wait be patient see
where it puts us

  where invited raven smiling
	startling stories

  squarely on the horns of a dilemma
and both of them uncomfortably sharp
heraty shifted in his seat as though his
southern aspect was peculiarly suscep-
tible to suggestion without self-gov-
ernment the venusians and martians
remain terrestrials officially and
legally sharing this world with us en-
joying all our rights as common citizens
that means they can come here as often
and for as long as they please in any
numbers he bent forward slapped
ireful hands on the table they can
walk right in through the ever-open
door while crammed to the top hairs
with arson sabotage and every form of
malicious intent and we cant keep em
out we cant refuse entry unless we first
make them precisely what they want to
be namely aliens we wont make aliens
of them

  too bad sympathized raven
there are good reasons

  of course dozens of them including
some known only to a select few
heraty hesitated went on one such is
that we are on the verge of getting to
the outer planets thats a jump a heck
of a big jump to back it up to the limit
settle ourselves there in strength and
get properly established well need all
the resources of three worlds without
any short-view quibbling between
them

  i can well imagine that raven
agreed thinking of venusian fuel-de-
posits and of mars strategic position

t owering his voice to lend signifi-
-j cance to his words heraty con-
tinued  in due time therell be another
jump it will take us to alpha centauri
-and there is some good though unpub-
lished evidence to suppose it may bring
us head-on against another intelligent
life form if that does occur well have to
hang together lest we hang separately
there will be no room for terrestrials
venusians martians jovians and other
planetary tribes well all be solarians
sink or swim thats how its got to be
whether nationalist-minded specimens

like it or not

  so youre faced by another dilemma
remarked raven peace might be as-
sured by publishing the warning facts
behind your policy-and thereby creat-
ing general alarm plus opposition to
further expansion

  precisely heraty agreed youve
put it in a nutshell theres a conflict of
interests which is going too far

  hm a pretty setup as sweet a mu-
tual animosity as could be contrived i
like it it smacks of an enticing chess
problem

  thats carsons parallel remarked
heraty he called it super-chess for
reasons youve yet to learn he said its
time we stuck a new piece on the board
youd better go see him and get in-
formed carsons the man who raked the
world for someone like you

  me david raven registered mild
surprise are there no others like me
that i wouldnt know heraty
showed himself far from anxious to dis-
cuss the subject such matters are left
entirely to carson and he has his own
secrets youd better go see him right
away

  very well sir is there anything
else

  only this you were brought here to
let you see that the world council is be-
hind you even though unofficially your
job is to stop this war-if you can
youll have no badge no documents
nothing to show that you have any
special status all youll have will be
your own abilities and our moral sup-
port no more

  it may be enough

  possibly admitted heraty im in
a poor position to judge carsons more
capable in that respect for what little
its worth ray own opinion is that be-
fore long your life wont be worth a
minutes purchase-and i sincerely hope
im wrong

me too said raven blank-faced
the council fidgeted again suspect-
ing him of secret amusement at their ex-
pense the deep silence came back and
the star

their formerly evasive eyes were on him
as he walked away with the same slow
deliberate confident gait with which he
had entered only the carpet whispered
and when he went out the big door
closed quietly without a click

  war remarked heraty is a two-
way game

ii

c- arson proved to be tall thin sad-
faced like one who regretted both the
necessity and expense of floral offerings
his coffin-bearers countenance was a

leina

mask behind which lurked an agile
mind a mind that could speak without
benefit of lips in other words carson
was a type one mutant a true telepath
theres a distinction here true tele-
paths differ from sub-telepaths in being
able to close their minds at will

 looking approvingly at ravens
equally tall but broader heavier frame
and noting the lean muscular features
his mind made contact without an in-
stants hesitation invariably a m rec-
ognizes a fellow m at first sense just
as a man sees a man because he is not

watchers	

blind or hears when not deaf

  his mind inquired did heraty
spout

  he did dramatically and uniform-
atively seating himself raven eyed
the metal plate angled on the others
desk it bore an inscription reading
mr carson director terran security
bureau he pointed to it is that to
remind you who you are if you get too
muddled to remember

  in a way yes it radiates what it
says it is anti-hypnotic a sour grin
came and went or so they assure me
theres been no occasion to try it out-
and im in no great hurry to test it
either a hypno who gets this far isnt
going to be held off by a plate

   still the fact that its presence is con-
sidered necessary is a bit ominous ra-
ven remarked has everyone got the
heebies around here even heraty in-
sinuated id one foot in the grave

  an exaggeration perhaps but not
without basis heraty shares with me
thedark suspicion that weve at least
one fifth columnist on the council if
theres anything to it youre a marked
man from now on

  thats pleasant you dig me up in
order to bury me

  your appearance before the council
was unavoidable carson told him
they insisted on having a look at you
whether i approved or not i didnt ap-
prove and heraty knows it he coun-
tered my arguments with an unanswer-
able point in which you should be inter-
ested

  what was that raven invited
that if you were only one-tenth as
good as id maintained you ought to be
there was no cause for worry whatso-
ever the enemy could do all the worry-
ing and heaven help the sailors on a
night like this

ravens bow was ironical so now
im expected to live up to the repu-
tation youve concocted for me dont
you think ive enough grief

  plenty of grief is my idea said
is	startling stories

carson displaying unexpected tough-
ness were in a jam so were flogging
the willing horse

  half an hour ago i was a goat now
a horse-and maybe part of a horse
any other animal imitations youd
like im pretty good at bird-calls
too

  youll sure have to call a few
mighty queer birds if youre going to
keep pace with the opposition much
less get ahead of them tugging open a
drawer carson took out a paper
glanced at it this is as far as weve
got with a top-secret list of extra-ter-
restrial varieties nominally and ac-
cording to law theyre all samples of
homo sapiens in grim fact theyre
homo something-else he consulted
the paper again to date venus and
mars have produced twelve distinct
kinds of mutants and possibly more
type six mutants for instance are
malleables

  raven stiffened in his seat opened
his mouth and emitted a loudly vocal
what

  malleables repeated carson
theyre not one hundred per centers
no radical alterations of the general
physique they can do nothing really
startling from a surgeons viewpoint
but theyve pans backed with cartilage
in lieu of bones are incredibly rubber-
faced and to that extent are good
really good you would kiss one think-
ing he was your own mother if it
struck his fancy to imitate your
mother

  speak for yourself raven said

  you know what i mean carson
persisted as facial mimics they must
be seen to be believed

  indicating the highly polished sur-
face of his desk carson continued
imagine this a gigantic checkerboard
with numberless squares per side
were using midget chessmen and
playing white there are two thou-
sand five hundred millions of us
against a mere thirty-two million
venusians and eighteen million mar-

tians on the face of it thats some pre-
ponderance weve got them hopeless-
ly outnumbered he made a dispar-
aging gesture outnumbered in what
in pawns

  obviously agreed raven

  you can see the way our opponents
figure the situation what they lose in
numbers they more than make up for
in superior pieces knights bishops
rooks queens and-what is so much
the worse for us-new-style pieces en-
dowed with eccentric powers peculiar
to themselves they reckon they can
produce them until were dizzy mu-
tants by the dozen each worth a whole
battalion of pawns

  raven said acceleration of evolu-
tionary factors as a direct result of
space-conquest was so inevitable that i
dont know how it got overlooked in the
beginning

  in those days the old-timers were
obsessed by atomic power to their
way of thinking it needed a world-wide
holocaust to produce mutations on a
large scale it just didnt occur to them
that hordes of venus-bound settlers
couldnt spend five solid searing
months in space under intense cosmic-
ray bombardment their genes being
kicked around every hour and minute
without there being a normal working
of cause and effect heck they went so
far as to build double-shelled ships
containing anti-ray blankets of com-
pressed ozone cutting down intensity
to some eighty times that at earth
level-yet failed to realize that eighty
times is eighty times the vagaries of
chance even themselves up over a long
period of time so that we can now say
venus trips have created about eighty
mutants where otherwise there would
have been only one

  mars is worse raven pointed out

  it is agreed carson despite its
smaller population mars has about as
many mutants as venus reason it
takes eleven months to get there every
mars settler had to endure hard radia-
tions twice as long as any venus set-
tiie star watchers

tier-and he goes on enduring it be-
cause of mars thinner atmosphere
human genes have a pretty wide
tolerance of massive particles like
cosmic rays they can be walloped
again and again but there are limits
he paused his fingers tapping the desk
while he reflected a moment in so
far as a mutant has military value
mars war potential equals that of
venus in theory-and its faulty
theory as youre going to show em-
mars and venus together can put
enough into the field to give us a run
for our money that is precisely what
theyre trying to do up to the present
theyve got away with it

  seems to me observed raven
thoughtfully that theyre making the
same mistake as the original pioneers
in sheer excess of enthusiasm theyre
overlooking the obvious

  and how theyve become so mu-
tant-conscious that they cant see wood
for trees youre going to show them-
i hope

  hope springs eternal in what way
do you suggest i show them

  thats up to you said carson
cheerfully passing the buck fat lot
of notice youd take of our advice even
if we offered any he dug out some
papers scanned them and went on
ill give you one case which is typical
of this squabble and the methods by
which its being fought- it was this
particular incident that told us there
was a war on wed got suspicious of a
series of apparently disconnected
events laid several camera-traps most
were put out of action a few failed for
no known reason but one registered

eyes keenly upon carson raven
bent forward and breathed ah
the camera revealed how three
guys destroyed some important space-
ship data which will take a year or
more to replace the first of these
three a type one mutant a true tele-
path kept mental watch for inter-
rupters the second a type two mu-



tant a floater-

  levitator suggested raven

  yes a levitator he got them over
two twenty-foot walls and lugged a
rope ladder up to a high window the
third one a type seven mutant a
hypno took care of three guards who
chipped in at different times stiffened
them into immobility erased the inci-
dent from their minds and substituted
false memories covering the cogent
minutes as it happened the guards
did not know of the cameras the tele-
path was therefore unable to detect
the trap in their minds the hypno had
no cause to make them go mess up the
job but for those cameras we wouldnt
have known a darned thing except that
in some mysterious manner the data
had evaporated in smoke

 humph raven appeared more
amused than impressed

  there have been several big fires
which because of the importance of
their strategic effects were inclined to
blame on pyrotics though we cant
prove it carson emitted a long-drawn
sigh what a war they make their
own rules as they go along their an-
tics play hob with military logistics
and if there were any brass-hats these
days theyd already be ripe for the
loony-bin

 time has marched on raven
pointed out

  i know i know were living in mod-
ern times as usual he shoved a
sheet of paper at his listener theres
a list of known mars-venus mutations
numbered according to type and let-
tered for military value-if you can
call it that he sniffed as if there
were doubts about calling it that d
means dangerous d-plus more so i
means innocuous-perhaps and that
list may not be complete its as far
as weve got to date

  raven studied it carefully it read

	true telepaths	d

	floaters	d

	pyrotics	d

  	chameleons	t
 

	nocturnals

	malleables

        	hypnos

	supersonics

	mini-engineers	d

	radiosensitives	d

	insectivocals	d

	teleports	d

  when he had finished raven asked
so far as you know all these skewboys
remain true to type that is to say the
floaters can only levitate themselves
and anything theyre able to carry but
cannot cause levitation of objects the
teleports have the reverse aptitude of
levitating objects but cannot lift them-
selves the telepaths arent hypnotic
and the hypnos arent telepathic
that is correct one man one ap-
titude

  hah said raven grinning broad-
ly ha stuffing the list into a
pocket he got up went toward the
door they are under the delusion
that old mother earth aint what she
used to be 

  you said it shes aged decrepit
senile thick-witted and hopelessly out
of touch with the facts of life all shes
got left is her last dying kick you go
and shoot her full of life

  ill do just that raven promised
providing i can stay in one piece long
enough to take aim he went out
closing the door carefully behind him

ill

the fun started at once outside on the
street it could hardly have been
more prompt though naturally it lacked
the finesse that might have been evident
had the organizers enjoyed longer warn-
ing and greater time for preparation as
it was the tactic had a spur-of-the-mo-
ment touch about it but what it lost in
thoroughness it gained in swiftness

  raven walked through the front door-
way of the security bureau building
gave the come-hither sign to a taxi
prowling overhead the machine did a
falling turn into the lower northbound
level of traffic dropped out of that and
into the sitting level and hit the street

with a rubbery bounce

the taxi was a transparent ball
mounted on a ring of smaller balls de-
signed to absorb the landing-whack
there were no wings vanes or jets in
evidence it was the latest model anti-
grav-cab value about twelve thousand
credits

  opening the door the driver suffused
his beefy features with professional hos-
pitality noted that the customer did not
move welcome gradually faded from
the mat he frowned scratched his blue
chin-stubble with a cracked fingernail
and spoke with a cracked voice

  see here mac unless im imagining
things you gave me the-

  shut up until im ready for you
raven snapped he was still on the side-
walk some ten feet from the cab watch-
ing nothing in particular

  the cabbie increased his frown gave
the stubble another rake in sonic imita-
tion of a space-mechanic sandpapering
the jets his right arm was still extend-
ed holding the door open something
wafted the sleeve of the arm depressing
it slightly as if an unseen breath had
blown upon it

  raven came to life approached the
door but did not get into the taxi you
got a melter

  sure whered i be without one if a
bounce-arm snapped the cabbie pro-
duced one from his instrument-board
pocket it resembled a tiny hand gun
what dyou want it for

  im going to bum your seat raven
informed taking it from him

  are you now the drivers small
sunken eyes went still smaller more
sunken a smirk broke across his face
revealed two molar gaps its your un-
lucky day daffy his hand dived into
the same instrument-board pocket came
out holding another melter i happen to
carry em in pairs you fix my pants and
ill fix yours thats fair aint it

  a pants-fixing performance would
interest several scientists more than
mightily assured raven when done
with instruments effective only upon

metals he smiled at the others sud-
den look of uncertainty added i was
referring to the cabs seat of course
you must be sort of rear-conscious

with that he stuck the nozzle of the
midget auto-welder into a tear in the
rear seats upholstery squeezed the han-
dle

  nothing visible came from the melter
though his hand gave a slight jolt a
thin spurt of strong-smelling fumes shot
out of the plasticoid upholstery as some-
thing within it fused at high heat calm-
ly raven climbed into the cab closed the
door behind him

  all right on your way leaning for-
ward he put the melter back into its
pocket

  the cabbie moped confusedly at his
controls while the antigrav machine
soared to five thousand feet and drifted
southward his heavy brows waggled
from time to time with the effort of
striving to think it out

  ignoring him raven shoved an inves-
tigatory hand into the still-warm gap in
the upholstery felt around touched hot
metal brought up a badly warped in-
strument no longer than a cigarette and
not as thick it was gold-colored had
stubby wings now curled and distorted
	startling stories

by heat its pointed front end carried a
lens half the size of a seed pearl its flat-
tened rear was pierced with seven nee-
dle-fine holes

  he did not have to pull this contrap-
tion to pieces to discern what was in-
side it was all there and he knew it was
there the tiny engine the guiding scan-
ner the minuscule radio circuit that
could yell pip-pip for hours the match-
head sized self-destroying charge-all in
a weight of something under three
ounces

  turning raven had a look through
the rear window so many cabs tour-
ers sporters and official machines were
floating around on various levels that it
was quite impossible to decide whether
he was still being followed visually no
matter a mess of traffic effectively hid-
ing the hunters could also conceal the
hunted

  tossing the winged cylinder into the
pocket occupied by the melters he said
to the driver you can have that thing-
umbob for your very own it contains
items worth some fifty credits

  theres ten owing for that hole in
the seat

   ill pay when i get out

  okay the other perked up slightly
taking the winged cylinder out of the
pocket he fingered it curiously put it
back say how did you know it was
there

  it doesnt bear thinking about
  huh

  people who shoot dingbats through
cab doors should not think of what
theyre doing even if they are half a
mile away in no detectable direction
thoughts can be overheard sometimes
he smiled at the back of the cabbies
neck have you ever been able to do
anything without thinking about it
only once holding up his left hand
he showed the stump of a thumb it
cost me this

  pity that mini-engineers arent also
true telepaths observed raven mostly
to himself

  pity that whatzits arent whozita

inquired the pawn twisting in his seat
and waggling his eyebrows again

  take no notice i was reciting

tn silence they covered another for-
a ty miles still at the same level sky-
traffic was thinning out as they got well
beyond the city limits

  forgot to bring my mittens grum-
bled the cabbie shouldnt oughta for-
get my mittens ill need them at the
south pole

  in that case well call it a day part
way there raven told him ill let you
know when he had another long look
through the rear window meanwhile
you can get in some practice at shaking
off followers not that i can tell whether
weve got any but maybe

  cutting the dogs lead will cost you
fifty the cabbie eyed him via the rear-
view mirror and that includes a but-
toned trap guaranteed unopenable
youll open for them because you
wont be able to help it raven informed
darkly they have techniques involv-
ing compulsion and no cash he gave a
resigned sigh oh well by that time it
wont matter it will be too late any-
way the fifty is yours just for ducking
out he grabbed the seat-grips as the
cab swayed darted sidewise shot up
into a cloud you will have to do bet-
ter than this youre not radar-proof
gimme time i aint got started yet
lying back in his seat raven con-
tinued to hold the grips while the cabbie
performed the fellow was good his elu-
sive tactics indicative of the number of
uneasy characters he must have carried
in the past

  two hours later when they thumped
the lawn behind a long low house noth-
ing was visible in the sky except a high-
flying police patrol heading north the
patrol bulleted onward in complete dis-
regard of the sphere upon the lawn and
whined out of sight

  solemnly raven counted out the prom-
ised fifty

  the woman within the long low house
was a little too big a little too generous-
the star watchers	

ly proportioned and moved with the de-
liberation of those weighty above the
average her eyes were very big wide
apart and blackly brilliant her mouth
was large her ears likewise her hair a
coal-black mop physically she was no
sylph yet at one time or another twenty
suitors had pursued her and reacted to
her rejections with despair the reason
what burned within her shone visibly
through those great eyes and made her
surpassingly beautiful

  giving raven a warm big-fingered
hand she exclaimed with her mind and
not with her voice david whatever
brings you here

  he responded in the same manner
mentally two birds he smiled into
the orbs that made her lovely the two
i hope to kill with one stone

  kill did i sense you form that
dreadful word kill her grip tightened
a little as anxiety came into her face
you have been talked into something
i know it i can feel it you have been
persuaded to interfere releasing his
hand she seated herself on a pneumatic
lounge gazed morbidly at the wall we
have always agreed that we must never
be tempted to interfere it would not be
wise it would frighten humankind
frightened people strike blindly at the
source of their fear besides so long as
we are not guilty of interference they
may think us incapable of it

   that is excellent logic providing that
its premise is correct and unfortunately
it isnt he sat down opposite looking
at her leina weve slipped a little in
one respect namely that theyre
shrewder than we thought

  in what way

  they got desperate enough to search
the world on the million-to-one offchance
of finding someone able to interfere-
and traced me

  traced you her alarm heightened
how did they manage that
genetically through the records
they must have classified and analyzed
some ten or twenty successive genera-
tions wading through endless births

marriages and deaths knowing nothing
of what they were going to find if any-
thing but hoping for the best my case
was a giveaway in the face of so pains-
taking a system as that

   if they can do that with you they can
do it with others she commented un-
happily

  there seem to be no others only we
two-and youre exempt

  am i how do you know that
the sorting-out has already been
done he told her in proof of which i
have been fingered since you have not
been similarly nailed down i can only
conclude that they found you but ignored
you because you are female or alterna-
tively that you are concealed by benefit
of ancestors allergic to documents such
as one or two healthy pirates

   thank you she said slightly miffed
the pleasures mine he assured her
grinning

t eaning forward her eyes keened
into his david what do they want
you to do tell me

  in full detail he informed her what
had happened finishing so far the
mars-venus combine have been satisfied
merely to try crippling us by degrees-
the technique of long maintained and
gradually increasing pressure-knowing
that unless we can think up effective
counteraction something is going to
crack ultimately

   its no business of ours she decided
let argumentative worlds fight it out
between themselves

  thats how i was tempted to view
it he admitted until i remembered
how history shows that one darned thing
leads to another look leina it was
only a matter of time before earth de-
cided it had had enough and must hit
back that time appears to have arrived
if earth cant strike with finesse it will
strike without finesse roughly and
toughly mars-venus will promptly get
more riled than ever decide its time to
become really hard your own imagina-
tion can take it from there
	startling stories

  it can she agreed without relish
much as i dislike poking a finger into
human affairs he concluded i have an
even stronger distaste for the notion of
hiding under a mountain while the at-
mosphere flames and the world shudders
all around me carson thinks i can do
something about it single-handed

  oh dear her hands fidgeted why
must people be so stubborn and idiotic
then she added what do you wish me
to do for you david

  look after my best suit he tapped
his chest meaningly it fits me perfect-
ly and its the only one ive got i like it
and dont want to lose it

  david her mental impulse was
sharp and immeasurably shocked not
that you cant do that not without
permission it is a fundamental viola-
tion it isnt ethical

  neither is war

 but-

  hush he raised a warning finger
they are coming for me already it
didnt take them long to find me he
glanced at the wall-clock not quite
three hours thats what i call efficien-
cy his eyes moved back to hers do
you sense their approach 

  she nodded and sat waiting in silence
presently the door-gongs clanged softly
standing up she hesitated a moment
glanced at the impassive raven he
responded with a careless shrug she
went to the door opened it her manner
was that of one deprived by circum-
stances of all initiative

rv

   ive men were grouped by a bullet-
shaped sportship some four hundred
yards from the house two more were
waiting on her doorstep all were clad
in the black and silver uniform of secu-
rity police

  the two at the door were burly leath-
er-faced specimens alike enough to be
brothers but they were different the
mind of one probed at leinas while the
others did not one was a telepath the

other something else she countered the
telepath by snapping her own mind shut
the groping mentality immediately
sensed the closure and recoiled

  another m he told his companion
just as well theres a bunch of us isnt
it without waiting for comment he
spoke to leina vocally you can talk to
me of your own free will he paused to
enjoy a harsh chuckle went on or you
can talk to my friend involuntarily
whichever you please as you can see
we are police

  she said tartly a police officer would
refer to another as his fellow officer and
not as his friend neither would he utter
implied threats right at the start

  the second man who had remained
silent up to that point now chipped in
rather talk to me eh his eyes gained
a strange light grew larger a hypno

  what do you want she asked the
first man

  raven

  so

  hes here he added trying to peer
over her shoulder we know hes here
so

  were taking him in for question-
ing

  ravens voice sounded from the room
at back it is most kind and thoughtful
of you leina to try and detain the gen-
tlemen but it is futile please come in
the invaders slowed up as they got
into the room their expressions becom-
ing wary they had small blued-steel
guns in their hands and they kept well
apart as if suspecting their quarry of the
ability to lay both of them at one swipe

  still sitting and amused by their
alertness david raven said ah mr
steen and mr grayson he made no
attempt to stand and the sight of their
ready weapons disturbed him not at all
a telepath and a hypno-with a bunch
of other skewboys waiting outside i am
greatly honored

grayson the telepath commented
to his companion listen whos
calling us skewboys making an impa-
the star watchers

tient motion at raven he added all
right brain-picker pack your pemmi-
can and mush

  to where

   youll find out

  fso it seems agreed raven dryly
the ultimate destination does not ap-
pear in your mind i take it that you do
not enjoy the confidence of your supe-
riors

  neither do you grayson retorted
come on now-we cant stand here all
day

  oh well standing up raven
stretched himself his gaze rested on
steen the hypno as he inquired
whats eating you baggy never
found anyone so fascinating before

  steen responded im wondering
what all the excitement is about you
havent got four arms and two heads
whats supposed to make you so mar-
velous

  he isnt so marvelous grayson
chipped in impatiently looks to me
like headquarters have got stirred up by
the usual exaggerated rumors i know
what hes got and it isnt so much

  steen laughed mockingly

  you do asked raven looking at
him

 yes youre merely a new breed of
telepath you can read minds even while
keeping your own closed you read mine
while yours remained shut to me you
dont have to open your own before you
can peer into others its a nice trick
and a useful one he sniffed his con-
tempt but as an interesting variation



its not big enough to worry two plan-
ets

  then what are you worrying about
raven pressed having learned the
worst youve learned the lot beat it and
leave me to ponder the sins of my
youth

  weve been ordered to bring you in
for questioning that is to say in one
piece so were bringing you gray-
sons sniff was louder were dragging
back the tiger even though it smells to
me of kitten

  i-eina please fetch my hat and little
brown bag raven threw a wink to
where she stood in the doorway

  no you dont grayson rasped at
her you stay put he turned back to
raven go fetch them yourself then
to steen you go with him ill keep an
eye on the large lady

  the pair walked stolidly into the ad-
joining room raven leading steen close
behind grayson squatted on one arm of
a pneumaseat rested his gun-hand on
his knees eyed leina speculatively

  unload your dogs plentiful youre
no shapely statue

  she flushed a little sat down

  grayson continued i cant tell whats
in your mind another oyster arent
you anyway if youre hoping hell
manage to pull a fast one on steen you
can save your brain the strain of
thought

  offering no comment she continued to
gaze at the wall

maneuver any hypno at a distance be-
cause he can read intentions and has
space in which to get out from under
grayson gave it the authority of person-
al experience but close up he hasnt
the chance of a celluloid cat the hypno
is the winnah every time

  she did not respond her face was
strained as she strove to listen through
and beyond his talk grayson made a
sudden and vicious thrust at her mind
hoping to catch it unaware and struck
nothing but impenetrable blankness a
faint scuffle sounded in the other room
followed by the merest whisper of a
gasp

  grayson came erect looking like one
who has not heard something that he
should have heard besides theres me
here with this gun and theres a mighty
tough bunch outside he glanced at the
door of the other room all the same
theyre slow in there

oomething about her face or her
 eyes or the tone of her voice aroused
his suppressed suspicions on your
feet buxom walk in there slowly two
paces ahead of me well see whats
keeping them

  leina got up bracing herself a mo-
ment on the arm of the pneumaseat re-
luctantly she turned to face the door her
eyes lowered as if to delay the vision of
what lay behind the door or of what
might at any moment walk through it

  steen came through it rubbing his
chin and grinning wryly he was alone

  he tried to be funny announced
steen addressing grayson and point-
edly ignoring leina result hes stiffer
than a tombstone well need a long
board to carry him out

  hah grayson relaxed let the gun
droop as the other continued toward
him triumphantly he said to leina
what did i tell you he was a dope to
try it close up

  yes agreed steen coming nearer
nearer he was a dope he stopped
face to face with grayson looking
straight at him gaze level with gaze

not a chance close up his eyes were
brilliant and very large

  graysons fingers twitched loosened
the gun dropped thumped upon the car-
pet his mouth opened and shut faint
words came out uttered with difficulty

  steen    what the heck    are you
   doing

  ravens not here

  ravens not here mumbled gray-
son in mechanical tones his mind over-
whelmed

  we have seen nothing of him we
were too late

  grayson repeated it like an automa-
ton

  too late by forty minutes the over-
powering voice of steen insisted

  too late by forty minutes agreed
grayson

  he took off in a gold-colored twenty-
tube racing craft number xb the
property of the world council
grayson got it off pat word for word
he had the rigid pose and blank inane
expression of a waxy one gathering dust
in a tailors window

  destination unknown

  that too was parroted

  there is nobody in this villa but a
fat woman an im of no consequence
there is nobody mumbled grayson
glassy-eyed half-blind half-deaf and
mentally enslaved there is nobody 
nobody  but a fat woman of no conse-
quence

  steen said pick up your gun lets
go outside and report

  he pushed past the fat woman of no
consequence grayson following sheep-
like neither favored leina with so
much as a glance her own eyes were
on steen studying his face reaching for
what lay behind the mask

  she closed the door sighed and wrung
her hands in the manner of women since
the beginning of time there were stum-
bling sounds behind her turning she
faced the figure of david raven swaying
uncertainly two yards away

  the figure was bent forward hands
over its face rubbing its features as
the star watchers	

though not sure on which side of its head
they were placed the body sagged a
moment straightened the hands came
away revealing a tormented counte-
nance and eyes terribly shocked

  mine croaked ravens voice he
snatched away that which is mine and
mine alone

  he paused staring at her then he
moved forward arms outstretched fin-
gers crooked

  you knew about this you knew
about it and helped his fingers trem-
bled as they reached for her neck while
she stood unmoving impassive the
hands touched her neck closed around
she made no move to resist

  for almost a minute he held her like
that finally he let go of her backed
away hurriedly with shock added to
shock he found his voice again

  oh heavens above you too

  of course that was the bond be-
tween us she watched him sit down
and again start feeling for bis face
after a while she said there is a law
as strong and as fundamental as that of
survival it says  am me-i cannot be
not-me so unless-

  unless his hands came away fast
as he looked up startled

  unless you play it our way she in-
formed if you do then what has been
done can be undone

  what do you want of me he was
upright now a gleam of hope showing

  implicit obedience

  you shall have it he promised

h aller boss of the waiting bunch
was a thin-boned individual six feet tall
martian-born and a m-a pyrotic
leaning against the tail of his ship he
fiddled with a silver button on the jacket
of his phony police uniform and regis-
tered disappointment as steen and gray-
son came up

  welir

  no luck said steen

  you mean hed already gone

  of course

  haller pushed away from the wall
let go the button picked his teeth in-
stead i guess it was to be expected
the way he lit out from the bureau
showed he was leery and in a rush
how long has he been gone

  forty minutes informed steen
he had three hours start so that
means were catching up wheres he
making for

  that said steen is something he
omitted to divulge to the generous
helping of femme he left in the house
all she knows is that he came in a
taxi grabbed some stuff hed dumped
here and shot off in an xb

  a female in the house echoed
haller whats her place in his life
ha said steen smirking
i see declared haller not seeing
at all his gaze wandered to the silent
dummy like grayson and lingered there
half a minute later a frown corrugated
his forehead as he asked what the
devil is afflicting you

  eh grayson blinked uncertainly
me

  youre a m and supposed to be
able to read my mind although i cant
read yours ive just asked you ten
times mentally whether youve got a
bellyache and youve reacted as if
thought is a phenomenon confined to
some place the other side of jupiter
whats up with you to look at you
one would imagine you were suffering
from an overdose of hypno

  an overdose of his own medicine
steen put in he tangled with the lady
who happened to be another m howd
you like to be nagged to death tele-
pathically as well as vocally

  heaven forbid said haller his
suspicions lulled he added lets take
steps that raven guy isnt giving us
any time to waste

  he climbed into the ship the others
following while the lock closed and
the tubes warmed he dug out his inter-
planetary register thumbed its pages
found the item he was seeking
	startling stories

  here it is xb - berilligilt-
coated single-seater with twenty tubes
earth-mass three hundred tons max
range half a million described as a
world council courier-boat bearing
police and customs exemption hm
that makes it awkward to intercept
openly with snoopers around
assuming we ever find it offered
steen

confidently haller asserted
well get our cross-hairs dead on
it that half million range is a comfort
it ties him down to earth or moon
he consulted a coded list of radio
channels correlated with times three-
thirty  channel nine pressing the
appropriate stud he spoke into a hand
microphone what he said went out in
pulses scrambled and was much too
brief to permit detection and unsorting
by any eavesdropper

  combine call haller to dean
come in haller responded the
loudspeaker thinly

  find xb

  xb stand jay

  turning the pilots seat sidewise
haller sat in it lit a venusian cheroot
fifteen inches long he put his feet up
on the desk eyed the loudspeaker-
it said xb not listed in to-
days departures not shown on any
of todays police observation reports
stand by

  queer remarked haller taking a
long suck and blowing a lopsided
smoke-ring he couldnt lift it today
without getting it marked airborne
maybe he took it yesterday or the
day before and parked it here steen
suggested carefully he closed the door
of the pilots cabin made sure that it
was firmly shut he sat on the edge of
the desk alongside hallers feet and
waited for the next it came after ten
minutes

  dean to haller xb in charge of
courier joseph mcard at dome city
luna refueling for return closing
channel

  impossible haller ejaculated
m-possible he stood up bit off an
inch of cheroot spat it on the floor-
somebodys lying his eyes came
level with steens and promptly he
added you

  me with a pained expression
steen also stood up he was almost
chest to chest with the other

  either that or the dame gave you a
cockeyed number and grayson was too
dopy to detect it in her mind

  how could grayson penetrate a
mind as flat and blank as a mortuary
slab inquired steen

  he could have told you he was sty-
mied and let you take her over wheres
the point of you going around in pairs
if youre too dumb to co-operate
not dumb denied steen
somebodys nursing a month-old
mackerel haller insisted irritably i
can smell it theres something stinky
around maybe that dame stuffed it
up graysons vest hes got the stupe-
fied expression of someone whose best
friends have just told him thats not
like grayson go get him i want to
give him a going-over

  i dont think we need grayson
said steen very softly this is just
between us two 

  is it hallers self-command and
lack of surprise revealed him as a hard
character id a notion it was you
who lied steen i dont know whats
come over you but youd better not let
it go too far

  no

  lno youre a m but what of it
i can burn away your insides some
three or four seconds before you can
paralyze mine moreover paralysis
wears off after a few hours whereas
charring doesnt its decidedly per-
manent

  i know i know that is power
pyrotic power steen gestured and his
hand touched hallers casually al-
most accidentally the hand stuck
haller tried to pull his own away
found he couldnt the two hands ad-

  an equally swift and precisely simi-
lar change on the part of the other
thats funny so am i

  two hollow laughs as alike as twins
they sit down and play cards each
surreptitiously watching the other for
a moment when a face would forget-
fully relax and betray its owners true
identity

  two more enter intent on making it
a foursome one registers a moment of
intense mental strain floats clean over
the table and takes a chair on the other
side the second glares at a nearer
chair which trembles hesitates then
places itself under him as if shifted by
invisible hands

  the second entrant makes his cards
leap straight into his ready fingers
grunts as he studies them says com-
plainingly if you two dummies have
just got to be peters let us have differ-
ent smells sos well know who from
which another grunt i pass
grayson came into his subterranean
menagerie with his mind closed against
all intrusions his eyes alert suspicious
his manner jumpy he was in a hurry
and had the air of one with reason to
fear his own shadow

at the end of a long passage
where it terminated in a heavy
steel door grayson came face to face
with a hypno guard who said no
further chum this is where the boss
lives

  yes i know i want to see kayder
is it urgent and important
would i bother him if it wasnt
grayson stared back along the passage
made an impatient gesture tell him
hed better hear me before all this
blows up under us

  the other eyed him speculatively a
moment as if tempted to put him under
the influence and see whether it pro-
duced comments more sensible but
something in graysons bothered fea-
tures made him change his mind
shrugging he opened a mike trap in
the door spoke into it

  chief grayson of hallers crew is
here says its hot and wont keep
a voice came back ill give him two
minutes

  the guard whispered to grayson it
had better be good hes not full of love
today and opened the door

  a squat broad-shouldered man with
heavily underslung jaw kayder was
of venusian birth and probably the
only type eleven located on earth he
could converse in low almost unbear-
able chirrups with nine species of ve-
nusian bugs four of them highly poi-
sonous and willing to perform deadly
services for friends kayder therefore
enjoyed all the redoubtable power of
one with a personal army too vast to
destroy

  well he snapped glancing up
from papers on the bureau what is
it

  you dug up something about this
david raven and ordered that he be
brought in

  i did i dont know what hes got
but its alleged to be good where have
you put him

  nowhere he got away

  not for long assured kayder con-
fidently i know he is hell-bent for
a hideout some place it will take a
little while to dig him out he waved
a hand in dismissal keep on the
trail

  he wouldnt stay in a hideout long
grayson pointed out he might go
there for something he needed but hed
soon be away and jumping around
what good could he do squatting in
a hideout

  he could let the hue and cry go
past and emerge in his own sweet time
that would be his best technique as one
against a crowd-to tackle us in times
and places of his own choosing we
musnt give him any chance to do that
ive already told you said gray-
son that hes been trapped he was
flat on his belly with his tongue hang-
ing out and his sides heaving a fox
right at the last lap and he got away
the star watchers	

  kayder rocked back on the hind legs
of his chair mean to say you actually
had him you let him slip how was
that

  i dont know grayson was badly
worried thats why ive come to see
you

  be more specific what happened 

   we got into his hiding-place i made
a pass at his mind and got a complete
blank it was like feeling around in a
vacuum there was a woman in the
house and she was equally resistant
true telepaths both of them

  so what any average hypno could
easily-

  steen was with me as good a hypno
as any weve got raven made a fool
of him

  go on man dont stand there en-
joying dramatic pauses

  steen gave me the treatment con-
tinued grayson hurriedly and mor-
bidly he caught me on one leg and
made me marble-minded he made me
go back to the ship and confirm that
wed seen nothing of raven then he
went into hallers cabin

  what occurred after that kay-
ders eyes were like icicles

  a small spidery thing scuttled up
the leg of his pants lowering a casual
hand he got it helped it onto the
bureau it was thin and bright green
with eight crimson pin-heads for op-
tics

   distastefully watching this creature
grayson said a few hours later my
wits drifted back by then haller was
nuts and steen had disappeared

  you say haller was nuts

  yes he was babbling seemed as if
his brain had been twisted right
round

  hallers a pyrotic kayder ob-
served- you are a telepath did you
overlook those facts were you too
stupefied by events to remember
them

  i was not i took a look inside his
skull

  and what did you find

  it was mussed up something awful
his think-stuff was like freshly stirred
porridge he was nursing long chains
of pseudo-logic and working through
them like prayer beads batty more
than ripe for cushioned walls

  bad overdose of hypno diagnosed
kayder haller must have had hypno-
allergy theres no way of telling that
until a victim goes loopy probably his
condition will be permanent

  maybe it was accidental steen
wouldnt know haller was susceptible
i like to think so

  thats because you hate to think a
pal of yours could or would turn on
his friends and get them squinting down
their own spines its treachery

  i dont think so ravens got some-
thing to do with this insisted gray-
son doggedly- steen wouldnt do the
dirty on us without good reason

af course he wouldnt agreed
j kayder his features sardonic
he threw several tiny almost unbear-
able chirrups at the green spider-thing
it did a bizarre little dance that might
have meant something

  kayder continued every guy has a
reason good bad or indifferent i can
make a shrewd guess at whats wrong
with steen hes a low-priced man and
raven found it out

  even if hes the sort to be bought
over which i doubt how could he be
he made no contacts

  he was alone with raven wasnt
he

  yes admitted grayson for less
than a couple of minutes and in the
adjoining room with me still listening
in ravens mind remained blank
steens mind said raven turned casu-
ally to face him as if about to say
something raven touched him-and
steens mind promptly went blank too
a hypno cant shut off like a telepath
-but he did

ah said kayder watching him
that hit me immediately it was
mighty queer i got up to see what had
	startling stories

happened then steen reappeared i
was so relieved that i failed to notice
he was still blank before i could catch
on to that fact he had me where he
wanted me you dont expect an ally
to suddenly thump you on the dome
naturally endorsed kayder he
chirruped again at the spider which
obediently moved aside while he
reached for his desk mike well make
it a double hunt well have steen
dragged in for examination just as soon
as we can lay- hands on him

  youre forgetting something gray-
son offered im here

  kayder frowned what of it

  i couldnt get here without knowing
how and where he paused to let it
sink in steen knows too

  meaning you think were due for a
raid

  yes

  i doubt it said kayder calmly
pondering the point if terran coun-
terforces had learned of this center and
decided to put it out of business theyd
have moved mighty fast wed have had
our raid hours back

  whats to stop them biding their
time while they make suitable prep-
arations then blowing us sky-high
youre nervy there are several
things to stop them first theyd have
to work unsuspected and undetected by
us second a blowup would wipe out
a known center leaving them in due
time to seek its replacement some place
else

  i suppose so grayson was moody
uncertain

  third theyve no publicly satisfac-
tory excuse for becoming hard offi-
cially were terrans officially theres
no war were here on legitimate busi-
ness and can prove it that gets the
terrans all tied up in a mess of their
own contradictions until theyll admit
what they dont want to admit weve
got em where we want em

  i hope youre right

  you bet im right the terrans
are bogged knee-deep heads we win

tails they lose were betting on a sure
thing

  evidently steen doesnt see it that
way said grayson pointedly

  some people cant see further than
a fat wad providing its fat enough
i could go blind myself for whats in
the national treasury kayder sniffed
his contempt of those who put their
own price too low he switched his
mike activating it d hypno steen
has gone bad on us get him at all
costs and get him fast

  muffled by the heavy door an out-
side loudspeaker echoed d hypno
steen then another farther away
d hypno steen  get him fast

mjeina sensed ravens returning
she looked out the window saw him
entering the path reaching a decision
she drew away from the curtains
hes back i didnt expect him so soon
something must have gone wrong
she opened the door to the adjoining
room i cant stay and watch i just
cant

  dont leave me alone with him ill
try to kill him even though he kills
me ill-

  youll do nothing would you kill
your own self that would be a stupid
way to solve your predicament she
paused hearing a mental voice call
leina but not answering remem-
ber implicit obedience

  she went through closed the door
firmly deliberately finding a chair
she seated herself primly erect her
air was that of a schoolmarm about to
witness inexcusable vulgarity

  someone entered the other room his
mind reaching through the wall gently
nudging her its all right leina you
can come out very soon then vocally
to the other you ready to get back
a whisper yes oh heavens yes
here then

  leina covered her eyes though there
was nothing visible to hide a few swift
the star

little gasps and one small sob came
from the next room they were fol-
lowed by deep and thankful breathing
she stood up taut-faced and went to
the door

  david i warned you that you
shouldnt

  was there any other way out you
would rather i had taken she looked
at steen who lay limp and pale on
a pneumatic settee moving toward the
settee raven said i took your body
steen even though you are an enemy
i apologize for that it is not proper
to usurp the persons of the living
the living steen went two shades
whiter as he put emphasis on the word
his mind was in a turmoil you
mean-

  jump to no conclusions advised
raven seeing the others thoughts as
clearly as a page of print

  david put in leina eyeing the
window what if they come back in
greater strength and better prepared 
theyll come he stated but not
just yet he resumed with steen
theyre scouring the world for me
attributing to me an importance i dont
possess somebody must have given
them information to make them so ex-
cited do you know who gave it
no

  he accepted that without hesitation
theyre hunting for you as well
me steen sat up trying hard to
pull himself together

  yes i made a bitter mistake i
blundered badly by trying to take over
your vessels commander he was some-
thing more than a standard pyrotic
he had intuitive perceptiveness like
a rudimentary form of esp it en-
abled him to see or sense or estimate
things that he is not entitled to know

raven glanced sidewise as leina
put a hand to her throat

  i didnt expect that it caught me
by surprise he went on theres the
beginning of a type thirteen a pyrotic
with esp probably he doesnt realize

it himself he made a frantic snatch
at what he thought the only form of
self-preservation available by making
himself useless to me

  meaning inquired steen

  it was instinctive reaction raven
continued

  whats wrong with haller steen
persisted

  hes whirly said raven they
blame you for that

  why pick on me how could i-
lets put it another way-your body
is blamed 

  my body echoed steen slightly
fuddled but it wasnt me

  try convincing them of that
theyll put a telepath on me hell
read the truth i cant feed him lies
its impossible

  nothing is impossible the word
ought to be expunged from the lan-
guage you could lie all the way from
here to aldebaran if youd first been
conditioned by a hypno more powerful
than yourself

  they wouldnt kill me for that
mused steen openly troubled but
theyd plant me some place safe and
for keeps id rather be dead

  raven chuckled you mightnt know
it but youve got something there
youre in a sweet position to con-
sider it funny steen snapped back
who could put you in storage when
within five minutes you could confiscate
a guard and walk out on his legs why
you could even carry on from there
go grab the right official and sign an
order for your own release you could
   you could- his voice trailed off

  beginning to think of us as on the
winning side eh raven shifted his
aim to leina maybe its just as well
that i did take him over

  i say its wrong she responded
firmly always has been always will
be

  i agree with you in principle prac-
tice is something different necessity
knows no law now and again the end
justifies the means he returned to

steen look ive not come back for
the fun of it ive a reason and it
concerns you

  in what way

  first of all are you now willing to
play on our side or do you insist on
sticking to your own

  after this experience explained
steen fidgeting uneasily i feel that
changing sides would be the sensible
thing but i cant do it he shook
a positive head

  so you remain anti-terran

  no he shuffled his feet around
avoided the others gaze i wont be
anti-martian or anti-venusian to please
you or anyone else it goes against the
grain at the same time i feel that
this anti-terran business is stupid all
i want is to get home sit tight and be
neutral

  you may have a rough time trying to
sit on the fence raven observed
when parochial hysterics look around
for easy marks on whom to vent their
spite they usually choose a neutral

  ill take my chance on that

  have it your own way raven nod-
ded toward the door theres your road
out the price of freedom is one item of
information

  what do you want to know 

  some high-up terran blatted about
me and shoved the news out mighty fast
someone on our side is a stinker youve
already said you dont know who it is
who dyou think is likely to know
kayder said steen mostly because
he could not refuse

  whos he where does he live

that was easier not too dangerous
where does he live it enabled
him to picture kayder and his private
residence and at the same time to sup-
press all thoughts of the underground
center

  whats his special talent if any
raven asked after reading the previous
answers

  im not certain of that ive heard it
said hes a bug-talker
the star

  that will do me he jerked an in-
viting thumb toward the door out you
go and the best of luck

  ill need it steen admitted pausing
on the outer step he added and i hope
ill never see either of you again

  notice that leina became nervous
once more a helicopter coming
down she had a quick and wary look
herself falling fast david you talked
too much and stayed here too long what
are you going to do now

  he smiled at her it seems a woman
remains a woman come hell or high wa-
ter

  what dyou mean

when you get jumpy you slide right
off the band or close your receptive cir-
cuits or something its always best to
keep calm not everyone is an enemy
what are you talking about david 
listen he ordered

  mastering her emotions she let her
mind reach out now that her full atten-
tion was turned that way she could de-
tect the overhead jumble of thoughts
there were four personalities in the on-
coming machine their mental impulses
growing stronger every second and mak-
ing no attempt to blank out pawn-
minds all of them

house looks quiet whos that turn-
ing out of the path and into the road 
dunno but it isnt him-too short
and lumpy pause anyway carson
said thered be an outsize venus here
we can talk to her if we cant find him
hear that invited raven youve
got an unsuspected admirer-carson
never met him you must have been
telling him things she watched the
window continuing to listen the eerie
mind-voices seemed just over the roof

  dangling from twin circles of light
the thing lowered past the window
pressed its balloon tires into a bed of
marigolds four men got out one lean-
ing against the fuselage three heading
for the house all were in plain clothes

  meeting them at the door raven
asked whats this something ur-
gent

watchers	

  i wouldnt know about that the
leader eyed him up and down yes
youre raven all right carson wants to
talk to you he motioned toward the
waiting machine we came in this
drifter because it carries a security
beam you can speak to him direct from
there

  all right

  if youd had a telephone at this
place continued the other accompany-
ing him toward the helicopter he could
have called you without this trouble
thinking again he added no i guess
he wouldnt carson doesnt like snoop-
ers

  he shouldnt being who he is
agreed raven climbing into the ma-
chine he settled in its cubbyhole al-
lowed the other to switch the beam for
him

tjresently the screen livened
- glowed and carsons features came
into it

  that was quick he approved ive
got ten patrols out for you and thought
it might take them a week searching a
world for one man on the loose is a deal
tougher than it sounds what has hap-
pened if anything

  not much raven informed the
opposition has made two fast passes at
me ive made two at them nobody has
won a battle

  carson frowned thats your end of
the poker ours is less comfortable in
fact its white hot

  in what way

  the dexter united plant went sky-
high this ayem were keeping the news
off the spectroscreens as long as we can

  his hands involuntarily tightening
raven said dexters is a big place isnt
it

  big carson took a deep breath
the overnight shift which is their
smallest was just ending that cut
down the casualties to four thousand

  great heavens

  it has the superficial appearance of
an accident carson went on his tones


startling stories

harsh which means a heck of a lot be-
cause every incident is an accident so far
as we can tell we cant tell otherwise
until a few traps get sprung

   werent there any in this case
plenty ninety-five per cent of them
were blown to kingdom come the few
remaining were too damaged to function
or recorded nothing suspicious

  no survivors raven inquired
not exactly there were eyewitness-
es you could hardly call them survivors
since the nearest of them was a mile
from the plant they say there was a
sharp tremor in the ground a tremen-
dous whump and the entire outfit rained
around

  raven said gravely according to
what you first told me the oppositions
technique has been one of crafty but ef-
fective sabotage carried out without
spectacular loss of life if this is another
of their jobs it means a considerable
change of sentiment resulting in
changed tactics from now on lifes go-
ing to be cheap

  that is what we fear endorsed car-
son

  nodding agreement raven glanced
out of the cubbyhole why call me is
there a plan you want me to use

  no said carson what you do is
entirely up to you ive given you the in-
formation let you see what it may
mean he emitted a sigh rubbed his
forehead wearily real misfortunes do
occur from time to time even in the best
regulated communities without evi-
dence of some convincing sort weve no
way of telling a real one from a manu-
factured one

  you want me to drop everything and
look into this

   carsons features sharpened i dont
ending this senseless dispute somehow
-if it can be ended-is more important
than coping one at artime with its inci-
dents id rather you went right ahead
with whatever youve planned but i
also want you to use any opportunity to
dig up data on this blast

   all right ill keep my eyes open and

my ears perked youll get anything i
happen to find regarding the other
speculatively raven added just what
was this dexter plant doing anyway
you would ask me that
something secret that i shouldnt be
told

  well  he hesitated went on i
know of no satisfactory reason why you
shouldnt be told dexters were within
two months of completing a battery of
one dozen new-type engines employing
an equally new and revolutionary fuel
a small pilot model under auto-control
did a return trip to the asteroid belt end
of last year nothings been said to the
public-yet

  meaning were getting set for the
big jump asked raven

  we were carson displayed a touch
of bitterness four triple-engined jobs
were going to be aimed at the jovian
system moreover that was to be a try-
out a mere jaunt only the beginning
if they made it without trouble- he
let his voice die out

  the others on to pluto

carson repeated a jaunt

alpha centauri 

  maybe further than that its much
too early to estimate the limit but its
far away very far his attention set-
tled on ravens features you dont
look particularly excited about it

  im not it doesnt stir me in the
least offering no reason for his phleg-
matism he continued theres a skew-
boy around here a venusian named
kayder he operates the morning star
trading company im going to chase
him up

  kayder repeated carson making
notes on a pad not in view ill check
with intelligence even though hes le-
gally terran theyll have him on file as
a native-born venusian he finished
scribbling looked up all right make
use of that copter if you need it any-
thing else you want

   one fertile asteroid raven suggest-
ed for my very own
the star watchers	

  when weve taken over a few hun-
dreds of them ill reserve one for you
promised carson without smiling at
the rate were going itll be ready for oc-
cupation a hundred years after youre
dead the screen went blank

  for a short while raven sat looking at
it absent-mindedly faint amusement
lay over his lean muscular features a
hundred years after youre dead carson
had said in an era of expansion when
strange space-born aptitudes were pil-
ing up rapidly would unparalleled lon-
gevity be considered a mutation symp-
tom or what about imperviousness to
destruction at human hands

human hands david broke in
leinas mind-stream coming from the

ster on the rear plot watched two men
stow it in its little hangar they fas-
tened the sliding door joined him as he
walked to the back door of the house

  late again he grumbled the cops
are jumpy tonight swarming all over
the sky i was stopped three times he
sniffed his contempt

  something must have happened
ventured one though theres been
nothing out of the ordinary on the spec-
troscreens

  never is remarked the second
three weeks have gone by and still
theyve not admitted that raid on-
sh-h-h kayder jogged him with a
heavy elbow how many times do i
have to tell you to keep it buttoned

k-ayder came home as twilight
surrendered to dark dumped his sport-

 unlocking the door he went in warmed
 his hands at a thermic panel whats
 for dinner

  venus duck with roasted-

  the door-gongs made sonorous rever-
 berations kayder shot a sharp look at
 the taller of the two

  whos that

  the others mind reached toward the
 front came back he said fellow
 named david raven

  kayder sat down you sure of that
  its what his mind says

  what else does it say

  nothing only that his name is
david raven the rest is blank

  delay him a few seconds then show
 him in
	startling stories

  reaching to a desk kayder hurriedly
pulled out a drawer took from it a small
ornamented box of venusian bogwood
he flipped its lid upward beneath lay a
thick pad of purplish leaves mixed with
dry spike-shaped blossoms scattered
lightly over the center of this pad was
what appeared to be the merest pinch of
common salt

  he chirruped at the box promptly
the tiny glistening grains moved
swirled around

  he knows youre keeping him wait-
ing and why the tall man pointed out
he can snatch it straight out of your
bean

  let him what can he do about it
kayder poked the box across the desk
and nearer the facing chair a few shin-
ing specks soared out of it you worry
too much santil you telepaths are ail
alike he chirped again more living
motes went up circled spun into invisi-
bility show him in

cantil was plainly glad to get out so
 was his companion so far as they
were concerned when kayder started
playing around with his boxes the best
place was elsewhere

  their attitude gratified kayder it en-
hanced his sense of personal power su-
periority over pawns is a thing worth
having but to rise above those with re-
doubtable talents of their own is great-
ness indeed

  automatically the professional smile
of a trader welcoming big business suf-
fused his features as raven entered he
pointed to a chair was silent while he
weighed up the black glossy hair the
wide shoulders narrow hips collar ad
model he decided except for those sil-
ver-flecked eyes they looked too far
penetrated too deep

  they do said raven without ex-
pression very deep

  in no way disconcerted kayder gave
back im not jumpy see ive had too
many mind-pickers around me too long
ive been looking for you

  so nice of me to come raven sug-

gested whats the motive

  i wanted to know what youve got
kayder vfould much rather have stalled
over that and offered something decep-
tive but as he had remarked he was
accustomed to telepaths when your
mind is as wide open as the spectro-
screens sunday color-strips the only
thing you can do is admit whats on it
im led to believe youre extra-special
who led you raven watched him
keenly

  kayder gave a grating laugh you
ask me when vou can read it in my
mind

  it isnt in your mind maybe a hypno
dutifully eliminates it for you every now
and again as a safety measure if so
something can be done about that a
stamp can be erased but not the impres-
sion beneath it

  for somebody extra-special you lag
behind in the matter of wits kayder
opined what a hypno can do another
and better hypno can undo when i want
to keep something right out of my mind
i can dig up better and more effective
ways

  such as

  such as not taking it into my mind
in the first place

  meaning you get information from
an unknown source

  of course i asked for it to be kept
from me the best mind-picker this side
of creation cant extract what isnt
there

  an excellent precaution approved
raven peculiarly pleased with it he
swiped at something in midair swiped
again

  dont do that kayder ordered reg-
istering a sudden scowl

  why not

  those marsh-midges are mine
that doesnt entitle them to whine
around my ears he smacked hands
together wiped out a couple of them
the rest sheered away like a tiny dust
cloud besides there are plenty more
where these came from

  rayder stood up his face dark
the star watchers	

  in harsh threatening tones he said
those midges can do mighty unplea-
sant things to a man they can make
his legs swell until each is thicker than
his body the swelling creeps up he
becomes one immense elephantine
bloat utterly incapable of locomotion
interesting though sordid com-
mented raven cool and undisturbed
how nice to know im unlikely to be
the subject of their attentions
what makes you think that kay-
der beetled black brows at him

  several items for example what
information are you going to get out of
me when im bloated and buried
none but i wont need it when
youre dead

  an excusable error on your part
my friend sit down and compose your-
self think of the consequences of
bloating me nobody but a venusian
insectivocal could arrange such an end
so far as we know youre the only one
on this planet

  i am admitted kayder with a
touch of pride

  that narrows the suspects doesnt
it terran intelligence takes one look
at the body and plants a finger straight
on you they call it murder theyve
a penalty for that

glancing at the dust cloud kay-
der gave a sharp laugh thats
supposing there is a body for intelli-
gence to brood over but what if theres
not

  there wont be a body ill arrange
for it to be disintegrated and thus tidy
things up a bit

  you will arrange it mister were
talking about your corpse not mine
are we ravens smile was know-
ingly skeptical

  kayder pressed a button on his desk-
santil opened the door edged partway
through

  you heard anything kayder de-
manded

  no

  have you been trying

  of course it was no use i got your
mind only

  all right you may go kayder
watched the door close so youre a
new kind of telepath an armored mind-
probe one who can pick without being
picked that confirms what grayson
told me

  grayson echoed raven he gave
a careless shrug he who is only half-
informed is ill-informed id like to
learn who organized the dexter blow-
up

  huh

  they suffered a big blast it was
bad really bad 

  well whats that to me
nothing admitted raven deeply
disappointed

  there was good cause for discontent
a rush of thoughts had poured through
kayders mind in four seconds flat and
raven had perceived every one of them

  a big blow-up at dexters where
do i come in whats he getting at
putting that huge dump out of action
would be something of a master stroke
but we havent got round to it yet
could it be that those itchy martians
have started pulling fast ones of their
own i dont trust those martians
overmuch

  raven commented i doubt whether
you trust anyone or anything except
perhaps these bugs of yours his
attention went to the still-swirling
cloud seeming to have no trouble in
distinguishing and identifying every
individual within it some day even
those will let you down if only because
bugs must always be bugs

  when you talk about insects youre
talking to an authority said kayder
irritably he glowered straight ahead
youve read all my thoughts i cant
blank them out like a m and therefore
theyve been wide open to you so you
know that this dexter affair is no busi-
ness of mine

  i give you that at hour back id
have bet heavily on your being the
guilty party and id have lost thanks
	startling stories

for saving my money

  you must need it how much did
you pay steen

  nothing not a button

dyou expect me to believe that
like everyone else steen can stand
only so much raven told him youd
better write steen off as a case of battle
fatigue

  hell be dealt with in due course
promised kayder lending it menace
what did you do to haller

  not so much trouble with him is
that hes overeager hell be dead with-
in a week

  did you say dead

  yes studying him with cold amuse-
ment raven asked whats wrong
with that its not so long since you
yourself were openly gloating over
what id look like after your bugs had
been to work on me you enjoyed death
then didnt you

  i can enjoy it right now kayder
assured his thin mobile lips took on
a peculiar twist

  the telephone on his desk yelped
almost as if in protest of what was on
his mind he snatched it up well
it chattered metallically against his
ear finally he racked it leaned back
in his seat wiped his forehead haller
has done it he informed they say
he babbled some crazy stuff about
bright-eyed moths that fly through the
dark then he put himself down for
keeps

  was he married

  no

  then its of little consequence
raven casually dismissed it as if it
were a minor incident it was to be
expected he was overeager

  what dyou mean by that

  never mind all i will tell you is
this in the same circumstances you
would stand before me and joyfully
cut your own throat from ear to ear
laughing as you did it

  like heck i would kayder pointed
a finger weve met each other ive
got all i want out of you which is

that as something super-super you bear
a strong resemblance to a flat tire
theres the way out

  think as you please ravens smile
was calm and disturbingly cool all i
wanted of you was something on this
dexter case im not interested in any-
thing else intelligence can tend to it

  bah putting out a hand kayder
emitted inviting chirrups whirling
motes descended and settled on his
open palm the intelligence has
mooched behind me for months so
what im a terran engaged in legi-
timate business and nothing can be
proved against me

  not yet qualified raven going to
the door but remember those bright-
eyed moths that haller mentioned
opening the door he went out glanced
back through and finished thanks for
all that stuff on your underground
base

  what kayder dropped the box
midges and all

  dont reproach yourself or the
hypno who expunges it from your mind
every time you leave the place he
made a good thorough job of it-there
wasnt a trace but it made a detailed
and beautiful picture in friend santils
mind raven slammed the door

  kayder pulled out a mike switched
it on his voice was hoarse with sup-
pressed fury get on the jump and
shoot this around an intelligence raid
is due shortly number one cover-up
plan to operate at once number two
plan to be prepared in readiness david
raven is now on the run from this
address put him out of business any
way you can thats top priority-get
raven

the door opened and santil came
in saying look he caught me
napping in a way that i-

  idiot interjected kayder brist-
ling at the sight of him of all the
mentally gabby dopes you take the
biscuit

  he was blank see protested san-
the star watchers	

til flushing when youre born and
bred a telepath you cant help becom-
ing conditioned by it you know that a
blank mind can only be that of another
telepath or someone whos been treated
by a hypno you just naturally as-
sume that while he remains blank he
cannot listen i forgot that this fellow
could still feel around while mentally
deader than a dead dog

  you forgot jibed kayder its
top of the list of famous last words
i forgot  his irate gaze shifted to
a large mesh-covered box standing in
one corner if those hornets were able
to recognize individuals i could have
him stripped down to his skeleton no
matter how far hes got

  sourly he took up the telephone
dialed said you dean put those
emergency pips on the air yes i want
the-man-we-dont-know if he phones
back tell him ravens likely to put a
finger on local base ask him to use
his influence either to postpone or mi-
nimize a raid racking the instru-
ment he glowered at the door

  if hes got a good range hell have
overheard that santil pointed out

  thats taken for granted the
phone shrilled once more and he
picked it up with an air of expectation
murray here announced the voice at
the other end you sent me to dig up
stuff on this raven

  what have you got

  not so much id say the terrans
are becoming desperate scouring the
planet and making wild guesses
youre making one or two of your
own snapped kayder give me what
youve got and leave the guessing to
this end of the line

  his father was a pilot on the mars
run an exceptionally efficient m com-
ing from four telepathic generations
there was no mixing of talents mari-
tally speaking until ravens parents
met

  go on

  the mother was a radiosensitive with
an ancestry of radiosensitives plus one

supersonic according to professor
hartman the end product of such uni-
ons would most likely inherit only the
dominant talent and the odd exception
should amount to no more than an ab-
normal widening of telepathic range
into the longer band

   hes wrong there this skewboy can
pull others in even while hes holding
them off

  i wouldnt know about that
evaded murray im only telling you
what hartman says

   never mind lets have the rest
raven followed in pappys foot-
steps by getting his mars pilot certifi-
cate and thus holds the space-rank of
captain thats as far as he went hes
never taken a ship toward mars
hm thats strange kayder
frowned with thought any reason
that you could discover

   maybe he feels that his health wont

turn page
	startling stories

stand for any mars trips hazarded
murray not since he was killed

  eh kayders back hairs stiffened
say that again

  he was at the space port when the
old rimfire exploded like a bomb ten
years back it wrecked the control
tower and did some slaughter remem-
ber

   yes i saw it on the spectroscreens
raven was picked up definitely one
of the dear departed some young doc
played with the body just on a whim
he brought him back it was one of
those occasional returned-from-the-
grave cases murray paused added
thoughtfully since then i reckon hes
lost his nerve

  kayder pronged the phone leaned
back lost his nerve bunkum from
what i saw of him he never had any to
lose in the first place

  whos this youre talking about
shut up and let me think a spi-
der-thing crept out of his pocket
blinking around putting it on the desk
he let it play with his finger tip while
he mused aloud

  raven had a funny attitude toward
death he guessed haller would do
the dutch about ten minutes before it
happened thats because it takes one
nut to recognize another it also shows
that his own narrow escape has left
him queer in the head he tried it
once and it wasnt so bad-just like
sleep his attention moved from the
spider to santil his death data are
so unusual that he makes loony com-
putations upon it you see what it
means

  what

  unlimited foolhardy crackpot
courage hes a telepath better than
average and with the mental attitude
of a religious fanatic one taste of
death has killed his fear of it that
makes him totally unpredictable

something went pip-pip-pip under
the floor pulling open a drawer
he took from it another and much

smaller telephone and held it up to his
ear

  kayder

  ardern here the raid is on
  hows it going

  hah itd give you a very big laugh
the hypnos are weighing and bagging
tree-almonds the mini-engineers are
assembling ladies watches the tele-
ports are printing the news-from-ve-
nus sheet and acting like theyre all
being good at school the entire place
is happy peaceful innocent

  get the blanking done in time
most of it we had to boost the last
six through the chute but they got away
all right

  good said kayder with satisfac-
tion

  thats not all youve put out a call
for a smoothie named raven

  yes i have i want him-and fast
  well weve got him 

  kayder sucked in his breath with a
low hiss that made the spider jump
he soothed it with a finger

  you sure of that

  positive hes raven without a
shadow of doubt

  howd you manage to nail him
down

  no trouble at all he walked into
the cage locked the door on himself
hung his identity-card on the bars and
yelled for us to come and look at him

ix

k ayder made it in four minutes
one under the promised time the un-
pretentious house to which he went was
the terminal of the secret chute from
underground base

  the man waiting for him was small
and thin and had features permanently
yellowed by past spells of valley fever
he was a floater with a bad limp ac-
quired in his youth when once he over-
did the altitude

  well demanded kayder staring
around the room where is he
raven
the star watchers	

  of course

  hes aboard the fantome informed
ardern

  i thought you said wed got him
kayders ire started to rise what
dyou mean by giving me that stuff over
the phone about having him caged
so he is ardern insisted as you
well know the fantome is a homeward
boat about to blow for venus

  with a terran crew theyre al-
ways terrans

  what of it neither he nor they can
get up to any funny tricks in space
theyve got to land this raven will
then be on our own planet what more
could you want

  i wanted him myself

  ardern registered surprise you
didnt say so besides youd already
had him yourself you told as much
when you put out that call i took it
for granted the reason was that after
he left youd got a message from home
ordering you to take his head off
theres been no message going to
the window kayder gazed through the
dark at a string of distant green lights
that marked the local spaceport that
her over there

  yes ardern limped across to join
him

  he must have moved mighty fast
kayder consulted his wristwatch
scarcely half an hour since he left
a police copter took him

  how did you discover he was on
board

  easy as pie said ardern i was
by the gangway when this fellow came
from the copter gave the checker his
name as david raven claimed a cabin
i thought to myself thats the guy
kayders shouting for whereupon he
turned grinned at me like an alligator
grinning at a naked swimmer and said
youre dead right he shrugged
added so of course i beat it to the
nearest phone and told you

  hes got enough impudence to serve
a dozen kayder growled does he
think hes armor-plated or some-

thing he paced rapidly to and fro
afflicted with indecision whos on
her that we know

  too late to get a complete passenger
list she carries some three hundred
pity we cant search through the lot
and pick out the skewboys only ones
i know are twelve of our own men re-
turning for fourth-year leave

  what types are they

ardern replied ten mini-engi-
   neers and two teleports

  an ideal combination of talent to
send a pinhead exploder through his
keyhole and smear him across his bed
said kayder with heavy sarcasm bah
hed read every intention the moment
it jelled and be twenty jumps ahead of
them all the way

  he has to sleep ventured ardern
how do we know that nocturnals
dont sleep

  tell you what theres still radio
contact so lets get those twelve to rake
the ship for a homeward-bound tele-
path they could then enlist his help
no use kayder scoffed raven
can make his mind feel like a chunk of
marble kayder returned his attention
to the far-off green lights sometimes
i get fed up with our array of talent
bugs are best nobody can read a bugs
mind nobody can hypnotize a bug but
bugs obey only those whom they love
and that is that

  i once saw a pyrotic burn a thou-
sand of them

  indeed what happened after-
ward 

  ten thousand came and killed him
there you are said kayder with
satisfaction bugs-you cant beat
em

  he said nothing for it but to pass
the buck well let them handle him
at the other end if an entire world
cant cope with one not-so-hot skewboy
we might as well give up right now
thats what i said in the first
place ardern pointed out hes
caged himself
	startling stories

  maybe he has and maybe he hasnt
ill give them the tip to expect him
theyll meet the boat coming in and-
his voice cut off as the distant green
lights were suddenly outshone by a
vivid shaft of white fire which crawled
upward from ground level and in-
creased speed until eventually it was
spearing into the heavens a deep
roaring noise made the windows rattle

  there he goes being on the ship
hes stuck with it until he arrives into
our waiting arms

  ardern screwed up his yellow face
and looked vaguely bothered ive just
thought of something

  what

  i had to leave the gangway to go
to the phone

  and so

  how do we know hes actually on
that boat hes had all the time in
the world to walk off it again
could be admitted kayder frown-
ing hes artful enough for it but we
can check up quite easily are those
snoops out of the base yet

  ill see ardern flipped a tiny
wall switch spoke into the aperture
above it whos there

  philby responsed a voice

  those intelligence characters still
messing around

  theyre just gone

  fine im coming along with kay-
der to-

  dont know whats so fine about it
interrupted philby they took eight
of our fellows with them

  were those eight properly blanked 
kayder chipped in

  you bet they were

  then why should we worry lets
deal with one thing at a time and get
in touch with the fantome

  the receivers big screen cleared
showed the features of a dark-haired
alert individual with a chest mike hang-
ing from his neck the fantomes oper-
ator

  name please demanded the oper-
ator

  arthur kayder i want to talk to-

  kayder put in the operator
weve a passenger waiting to speak
to you

  hah murmured ardern nudging
kayder one of our boys has got him
spotted

  before kayder could say anything
 the operators face flashed off the screen
 and another came on it was ravens

  good evening louse-ridden his
 smile was impudent

  you kayder glowered at him

  me in person as you can see for
 yourself i am really and truly on board

  youll be sorry kayder promised

  meaning at the other end i know
 that your next move will be to tell them
 im coming youll get on the space-
 band and warn a world he chuckled
 i cant help but find it most flattering
 bugsy

  dont call me bugsy kayder shout-
 ed his broad features dark red

  temper temper raven chided if
 your looks could kill id drop dead right
 now

  youre going to do it anyway kay-
 der bawled ill see to that

  sweet of you to say so raven eyed
 him a moment then said very deliber-
 ately better put your affairs in order
 as best you can you may be away quite
 a spell he switched off

 cutting the set with a savage flip
 of his thumb kayder turned to
 ardern whats he mean about me
 going away i dont get it

  me neither

  they let it stew in their minds until
 philby came along and said theres
 a call waiting from you-dont-know-
 who

  kayder took the phone listened

  the familiar but unknown voice
rasped ive more than enough on my
plate without taking unnecessary risks
to rescue loud-mouthed blabs

  huh kayder blinked at the in-
 strument

  homicidal threats over an open
the star

transmission system with half the in-
telligence listening-in went on the
voice acid-toned under terran law
the penalty is up to five years in the
jug they can pin it on you beyond
my power to unpin theres nothing
you can do but get out fast take the
fantome and dont come back

  she jumped ten minutes ago said
kayder feeling futile

  thats your hard luck get out of
that base you mustnt be found there
and dont go home either

  but my army is there with them i
could-

  you could not corrected the voice
because you wont be given the chance
dont argue with me get out of sight
and lie low as best you can

  i can fight the charge kayder
pleaded

  look came back the voice wearily
the intelligence service wants to tie
you down now youve given them the
chance theyll tie you well and truly
the other went off kayder lugubri-
ously cradled the phone stared around
as though lost for suitable comment
whats the matter asked ardern

watching him

  theyre going to try lug me in for
up to five years

 why

  threatening murder

  holy smoke ardern backed away
limping they can do it too if they set
their minds on it his features became
curiously strained his body appeared to

watchers	

lengthen itself then his feet left the
ground and he soared toward a ceiling
shaft im going youre a complete
stranger to me he soared up the shaft

  kayder went out walked the streets
and back alleys until two in the morning
then he slunk along the darker side of
a square and four men emerged from a
black archway barred his path

  one of them a telepath spoke with
authoritative assurance youre arthur
kayder we want you

    ellow and thick the great crawl-
ing mists of venus pressed against the
forepeak ports when raven went into
the main cabin for a look at the radar
screen

  a constant shuddering went through
the entire length of the fantome as its
power plants strove to cope with their
most difficult task namely the rela-
tively slow maneuvering of a giant
structure primarily designed for super-
fast motion it was not easy it was
never easy

  all passengers likewise recognized
that this was the critical stage the in-
veterate card players became tense and
still the chatterers turned silent the
tambar drinkers were cold sober in a
flat unemotional voice an officer in the
forepeak was reciting over the loud-
speaker system one-forty thousand
one-thirty-five one-thirty thousand

	startling stories

  undisturbed raven watched the
screen and bided his time the moun-
tains passed center moved to base
drifted off the screen presently the
oval edge of the great plain was re-
vealed became clearer more detailed
streaked with broad rivers vibration
was now violent as the ship fought to
hold its tonnage in near balance with the
planets grip and come down still more
slowly

  twenty thousand nineteen-five hun-
dred

  several stared at raven as he got up
from his seat and left the cabin ignor-
ing them he walked rapidly forward
along a metal corridor until he reached
the starboard airlock this he decided
was as good a time as any the crew had
their hands full the passengers were
preoccupied with the safety of their own
skins

  he was smiling to himself as he op-
erated the automatic door stepped into
the lock and closed the door behind him
that action would light a crimson tell-
tale in the control room and soon some-
body would hotfoot along to see who
was fooling with the exit facilities no
matter any irate official would be at
least half a minute too late

  swiftly he released the seals of the
outer door unwound it opened it wide
none of the ships air went out but some
higher-pressure venusian air pushed in
bringing with it warmth dampness and
strong odors of mass vegetation

  somebody started hammering and
kicking on the inner door doing it with
the outraged vigor of authority success-
fully defied at the same time the loud-
speaker clicked changed voices and
spoke sharply

  you in airlock four close that outer
door and open the inner you are
warned that operation of the locks by
any unauthorized person is a serious
offense punishable by-

weaving a sardonic good-by to the
 loudspeaker raven leaped out he
plunged headlong into thick moist air

fell swiftly with many twists and turns
at one instant the fantome was a long
black cylinder flaming high above him
the next there was a whirling world of
trees and rivers rushing up to meet him

  only two kinds of people jumped out
of space-ships suicides and fugitive
floaters the latter invariably used their
supernormal power to drift down at a
leisurely rate they dared not do other-
wise suicides fell like stones

  raven was still five hundred feet
above the tree tops when the fantome
had become a foreshortened pencil-sized
vessel about to land just over the
horizon it was then that raven slowed
in midair

  the slowing was a curious phenome-
non having nothing in common with the
taut-faced mind-straining deceleration
of an accomplished floater the sudden
decrease of his rate of fall occurred
casually naturally somewhat in the
manner of a dropping spider that
changes its mind and pays out its line
less rapidly

  at tree-top height still some three
hundred and fifty feet above the ground
he was descending as if dangling from
an invisible parachute between huge
top branches as thick as the trunks of
adult earth trees he went down like a
drifting leaf slowed again hit the
ground with just enough force to leave
his heel marks in the turf

  this point was little more than a
mile from the rim of the great plain the
immense trees grew more widely apart
here with quiet cathedral-like glades
between them

  the news of his jump would gall the
deputation waiting at the spaceport but
it would not fool them for a moment
kayders message-assuming they had
got it-wouldtag him as a telepathic
oddity a kind of lam to whom terran
characters like heraty and carson at-
tributed greater importance than ap-
parently he deserved

  now theyd face the fact that he lrnd
left the ship like a levitator but had not
gone down like a levitator despite his
the star

free and seemingly helpless fall not one
of them would believe that he had made
his leap for the sheer pleasure of break-
ing his neck without hesitation they
would now accept the existence of some
new and previously unsuspected quasi-
levitative talent and adding that to what
they already knew he had got would
classify him as the first example of a
creature often postulated and greatly
feared the multitalented offspring of
mixed mutants

  the notion of a supertelepathic super-
levitator was patently absurd but the
opposition would swallow the absurdity
without a blink when it came along care-
fully disguised as a self-evident fact
they would want him badly and quick-
ly before he started playing hob with
other laws greatly esteemed because
they were profitable in terms of cash
or power

  the big laugh was on them and it
was a pity they would never know it
because there are facts of life not told
to the immature

  no natural laws had been or could be
abolished

  there were no multitalented humans

  there were only bright-eyed moths
that dexterously swoop and soar
through the endless reaches of the dark

  he sent out a powerful tight-beamed
mind call far below the normal tele-
pathic band charles

  yes david it came back promptly
as if the other had been listening in ex-
pectation of the summons the mental
impulses registered in twin receiving
centers and proved slightly out of phase

  raven turned to face the others di-
rection as automatically as a pawn
would turn to look at another

  i ducked out of the ship doubt
whether it was necessary but thought id
play safe

  yes i know came back the distant
mind mavis got a call from leina
they gabbled an hour about personal
things before leina remembered shed
come through to tell us you were on the
fantome it seems shed rather you kept

watchers	

to your proper job

  females remain female through the
whole of eternity raven offered

  so i went to the spaceport charles
continued and im outside it right now
cant get in because its barred to the
public and heavily guarded he
paused then commented why come on
a ship anyway if for some mysterious
reason you had to do it the slow way
couldnt you have inflated a small bal-
loon and drifted here

  occasionally there are considerations
more important than speed said
raven im wearing a body for in-
stance

  its precisely your body theyll be
seeking its a giveaway

  maybe but it is what i want them
to seek looking for a body will stop
them from getting ideas

  you know best charles conceded
are you coming to our place

  of course i called to make sure
youd be there

  we will see you shortly eh

  im starting right now

  forthwith he set off through the
shadowed glades toward the plain strid-
ing swiftly along and keeping watch
more with his mind than with his eyes

at the fringe of the trees he re-
ceived the first evidence of search
he stood in the darkness by a mighty
bole while a copter floated just over the
great umbrella of top branches it was
a big machine carrying a crew of ten
their minds could be counted as they
probed the thick greenery beneath
there were a half dozen telepaths listen-
ing eager to catch any stray mental im-
pulse he might be careless enough to let
loose

  this entire menagerie passed right
above and zigzagged onward blissfully
unaware of his existence a similar out-
fit was scouring a wide path on a rough-
ly parallel course two miles to the south
and yet another two miles northward

  he let them get well behind him before
he stepped into the open and followed
	startling stories

the outskirts of the trees until he struck
a dirt road once upon the highway he
felt less wary

  these flying search parties might be
composed of exceptional humans well
above pawn standard but they still
tended to fall into pawn errors such as
taking it for granted that anyone casu-
ally strolling in plain sight could have
nothing to hide

  there was still the risk though a
slight one that a clear record of his fea-
tures might be in circulation and a
hunter drop low enough to identify him

  but nobody showed above-average-
curiosity until he got within a short
distance of plain city at that point a
copter drifted immediately overhead
and he felt four minds spiking into his
own for their pains they were re-
warded with pictures of a sordid and
decidedly boring domestic wrangle

  just outside the citys rim he stepped
off the road to make way for a pon-
derous tractor that was dragging a
steel-barred trailer two hypnos and
one teleport were in charge of this be-
lated addition to the chase the chief
feature of which was represented by a
score of drooling tree-cats in the trailer
the latter could follow a spoor one week
old and literally sprint up the trunk of
any forest giant not smothered in
spikes

  as became a pawn raven chewed a
piece of purplish grass and stared dull-
eyed as this lot creaked and rumbled
past the minds of the whole bunch
were like open books one of the hypnos
was coddling a tambar hangover the
other missing a nights sleep and fre-
quently pinching himself to keep alert

  on they clanked down the road a
futile cavalcade made doubly absurd by
the mock-dopy watch of its quarry
probably by the fall of dark they would
catch and tear to bloody shreds a rare
jungle hobo or an illicit tambwr distiller
and return flushed with success

  ravens smile was bitter

  going into the city raven found his
way to a small granite house with bril-

liant orchids behind its windows there
was no difficulty about finding it al-
though he had never been here before

  when he arrived he did not have to
knock those waiting within had meas-
ured his every step and knew the mo-
ment he was there

xi

mavis petite blond and blue-eyed
seated herself in a deep chair folded her
hands in her lap and gazed at raven
with the same deep penetration that his
own eyes sometimes showed to the con-
siderable discomfort of others

  the other charles was a plump and
rather pompous little man blessed with
the lackluster optics of a pawn any
talented human would take one look at
charles and classify him as a nitwit
more by good luck than good manage-
ment charles was an entity exception-
ally well concealed and therefore a little
to be envied

  naturally we are very pleased to see
you said mavis speaking vocally and
with her mind shut tight but what
has happened to the rule that one stays
put on ones appointed ball
circumstances alter cases raven
retorted besides leina is still there
she can handle anything

  charles squatted comfortably with
pudgy legs stretched out nursed his
paunch according to leina you are
busily sticking your fingera into other
peoples affairs is that right

  about half right raven studied
him speculatively a moment someone
on this planet aided by unknown co-
operators on mars is having a good
time pulling terras hair they are like
mischievous children playing with a gun
not thinking that it might be loaded
hm charles thoughtfully rubbed
a pair of chins we know theres a
strong nationalist movement on this
particular lump of dirt but weve ig-
nored it as being of no especial interest
from our viewpoint even if they go so
far as to murder each other wholesale
the star watchers	

what does it matter its all to the
merry isnt it

  in one way it is in another it isnt
  meaning

  the terrans are badly in need of
unity because they are heading toward
the denebs

  theyre heading- charles voice
tailed off momentarily his dull eyes
revealed hidden fires are you telling
me that terran authorities actually
know about the denebs how the deuce
can they know

  because said raven patiently
they are now at development stage
four theyve got a better drive have
already tried it out are about to test
it further and are unable to prophesy
its limits theyve found enough to
arouse suspicions that sooner or later
they are going to collide with some other
unnamed undescribed life form you
know and i know that can only be the
denebs he wagged an emphatic
finger we also know that the denebs
have long been milling around like a pack
of hounds with fifty trails to follow and
that their general trend is in this direc- 
tion

quite undisturbed mavis put in
that is true however the last
prognosis gave them a minimum of two
centuries to find this system

  a conclusion based on data then
available said raven we have a new
and very weighty item now namely
that homer saps is rushing out to meet
them

  have you reported this demanded
charles

  most certainly

  and what was the response
thanks for the information
nothing more than that charles
lifted an eyebrow

  nothing assured raven what
more did you expect

  something less phelgmatic and more
emotional mavis interjected you
males are all the same cold and calcu-
lating why cant you stand on a table

and scream like a woman

 would it do any good asked
charles

  it would take some pleasure off the
glands ive got a few glands in case
you dont know

  that is a subject about which i am
passably informed said charles i
have glands myself one of them makes
me fat and inclined to laziness i appear
to lack the one that is bothering you at
the moment he pointed a plump digit
theres the table climb up and let go
a few shrill bellows we wont mind

  i am not in the habit of bellowing
said mavis acidly

  there you are he threw a glance
at raven and gave a fatalistic shrug
women    cold and calculating  
cant take the steam off their zip-bits
a day will come when ill trim your
wings a bit porky mavis promised

  fancy me with wings charles
laughed until his paunch trembled
what an imagination

  producing a tiny lace-edged hand-
kerchief mavis began to weep into it
very softly and quietly

  charles stared at her aghast well
what have i said now

  you voiced a stimulator raven told
him he went to mavis gently patted
her shoulder it isnt right to remain
when memories have become too much
for you and you want out we can find
another pair who-

  she whipped down the handkerchief
and said fiercely i dont want out
cant a girl ery if she wants to

  sure she can but-

  forget it she stuffed the hand-
kerchief into a pocket blinked a couple
of times smiled at him im all right
now

  does leina ever do that asked
charles looking at raven

  not while im around

  leina was older when    when-
mavis let the sentence go unfinished
they knew what she meant

  nobody else could have guessed it not
even the denebs but these two knew
	startling stories

  they were silent for sometime each
busy with entirely personal thoughts
that remained hidden behind mental
shields charles was the first to cease
ruminating and become vocal

  lets get down to business david
what are your plans and where do we
come in 

  the plans are elementary enough to
find identify and effectively deal with
the oppositions key man on venus
take away the locking stone and the
arch falls down

  sometimes qualified charles

  yes sometimes raven agreed if
their organization is as good as it ought
to be theyll have a deputy leader held
ready to replace him when necessary
in that case there will be another simi-
lar job on our hands

  and after that there will be the
martians charles pointed out

  not necessarily it depends on how
they react to whatever happens here
im hoping they will pipe down if venus
drops out

  one thing i dont get said charles
thoughtfully what was to stop terras
paying back the other planets in their
own coin sabotage and all that stuff
is a game at which two can play
because from the terran viewpoint
that would mean fooling around with
their own assets

  ah charles gave his chins an-
other massage theyre decidedly
handicapped there it gives the rebels
quite an advantage

  precisely

  its no business of ours put in
mavis if it was we would have been
told as much her gaze was suddenly
shrewd as it rested on raven have
you been requested to interfere

   no lady and its unlikely that i shall
be asked

  why

  because large as the issue may be in
this minor corner of the galaxy its
small and insignificant by comparison
with bigger issues elsewhere he added
slowly cogent information is all i ask

you need give no more help unless you
wish

  i do wish charles asserted he
glanced sidewise how about you
mavis 

  count me out im going to follow
leinas example and keep watch after
all thats what were here for isnt it

  raven said youre dead right
keeping watch is all-important i am
glad that fair maidens are available to
tend to the job it leaves us bull-headed
males free to get on with our interfer-
ing

she pulled a face at him but offered no

comment

  the setup here is amusing charles
said we have an orthodox governor
who utters strictly orthodox sentiments
and is happily ignorant that the under-
ground nationalist movement already is
doing ninety per cent of the bossing
the big noise in this movement the
figure the rank and file look up to is a
large and handsome fellow named
wollencott

  whats he got

  the face and figure for the part
charles answered he is a native-born
malleable with an imposing mane of
black hair and an equally imposing
voice

  all that doesnt sound so formid-
able raven offered

  wait a bit ive not finished wol-
lencott is so well suited to portray the
dynamic leader of a patriotic cause that
he might have been especially chosen for
the part-and he was

  by whom

  a hard character named thorstern
the real boss the power behind the
throne the lurker in the shadows

  the puppet master eh anything
special about him

  yes and no the most surprising
feature is that he is not mutant he
hasnt one paranormal aptitude
charles paused plucked thoughtfully at
a fat lip but he is ruthless ambitious
cunning an excellent psychologist and
the star watchers	

has a high-powered quick-moving brain
good enough to serve a thousand mon-
keys i classify him as an exceptionally
high grade of pawn given really good
wits even a pawn can pull the strings of
a dopy telepath

  i know ive listened in to one or two
such cases thats where the denebs
excel they make full use of what
theyve got becoming slightly rest-
less raven moved toward the door
but we dont have to cope with the

the razors edge

or

dont drop that blade

if you think mans oldest trouble is women
youre wrong his first and last headache is in getting
a decent shave and the man doesnt draw breath who
hasnt cursed his razor oft on a stilly mom well
cheer up men theres a new gimmick for you to try
a patent has been issued on razor blades of glass

   no fooling the glass is ground to an approximate
edge then dipped in ctching baths of hydrofluoric
acid which cuts the edge down to a keen smooth
tooth-free line the promise is made-and youve
heard this before-that the glass blades give a
superior shave and have excellent edge-holding
qualities besides which theyre cheap-if you dont
drop them

denebs just yet leastways not here
the immediate objective is thorstern
im coming with you heaving him-
self out of the pneumaseat charles
hitched his middle let guileless eyes rest
on mavis hold the fort honey if
anyone asks tell them papas gone fish-
ing-but dont say for what

  see that you come back she or-
dered in one piece and recognizable
thats all i ask

xn

k-lready the invariable eventide
fog was creeping into the city moving
with sluggish persistent purpose along
its streets and avenues in thin yellow

sworls that thickened as the hidden sun
went down by midnight it would be a
warm damp all-obscuring blanket

  raven and his companion passed a
shop window in which an outsize spec-
troscreen displayed ballet dancers mov-
ing delicately through a scene from les
sylphides here the prima ballerina
drifted across stage with infinite grace
pale and fragile like a blown snowflake
a few miles away within the encroach-
ing dark was monstrous vegetation that
marked the frontiers of the half-known
and the unknown it was a contrast of
extremes that few noticed and fewer
thought about

  stopping outside the window and ob-
serving the screen charles said see
the ease and grace with which she
pirouettes she fascinates because she
makes me wonder

  about what raven inquired
whether her type are paranormals
not recognized as such and not suspect-
ing it themselves maybe they have
some subconscious form of esp that im-
pels them to strain poetically toward a
goal they can neither name nor de-
scribe

  you may have something there
im sure i have david he turned
and walked on his gait like a penguins
waddle as a life form in their own
right human beings have made a good
accumulation of knowledge how im-
mensely greater might it be if they could
add to it all the items theyve already
got but cannot use because they dont
know they know them

  brother carson who is no stupe is
with you in that he showed me a list
of known mutants and warned me that
it might be far from complete

  charles nodded vigorously rumor
has it that an entirely new type was dis-
covered recently i was going to in-
vestigate when leina called through and
put me off

indeed what can this skewboy do
i cant swear that the story has any
basis in fact the yarn goes that a
young fellow of twenty-nine living in a
	startling stokiks

village two thousand miles away had an
unfortunate argument with a buzz saw
and so

   it whipped off his right hand quicker
than zip that was some six or eight
months ago the stump healed over and
he recovered from the shock next the
stump started to look queer got sort of
raggedy he went to a hospital they
kept him under observation a couple of
months then decided the age of miracles
is not past he was growing another
hand

  a biomechanic observed raven
can service himself with new parts
well its an innocuous faculty

   yes sure but the point is that up to
then he didnt know he could do it be-
cause he had never lost anything before

i wonder how many more lack vital
knowledge of themselves

  plenty look at what we know

   i am looking replied charles quiet-
ly it is so much that it would shake a
hundred worlds if they shared it david
do you suppose that-

raven had stopped in midstride
finish it charles finish what
you were going to say

  do you think that maybe even we
dont know enough that there are
others who do know more watching us
precisely as we watch these sometimes
pitying us sometimes laughing at us
i cant say he registered a wry
grin but if there are we do know one
thing-they dont interfere with us
dont they

  not noticeably not in any manner
we can recognize

  we recognize deneb tactics charles
retorted they would do plenty of
shoving around if they could

  or even better they could adopt our
own methods to our very great confu-
sion raven suggested manifestly
sceptical but willing to take it along
they could appear to you and me
pretty much as we appear to all these
he waved a hand to indicate the local
citizenry supposing i told you that

im a deneb myself-do you dare to call
me a liar

  i do said charles with no hesita-
tion you are a liar

  i resent having to admit it he
gave the other a reassuring clap on the
shoulder see you know what i am
therefore you have intuitive awareness
definitely youre a paranormal and
ought to take up ballet dancing

  hah charles gloomed down at his
ample front thats what i call throw-
ing it back at me

  he fell silent as three uniformed men
came around the next corner ahead and
stopped in their path

  the trio were dressed as forest
rangers the only organized body apart
from special squads of police officially
permitted to bear arms on venus

  one was murmuring seems futile
to me they admit he jumped out and
went down like a stone ten to one his
busted body is lying across a limb a
couple of hundred feet up and will stay
there until it rots

  orders are orders answered an-
other he was still beyond normal hear-
ing but well within mental pickup hes
got something special and nobody knows
what it is so wed better keep our eyes
skinned

  for what we dont know what he
looks like the description they gave
could fit fifty people living in my sec-
tion a pause then heck it could be
made to measure for this guy coming
along with the little fat dope

  it could at that lets stop him and
see what gives leave this to me as-
suming an attitude of studied dis-
interest the first speaker waited until
they drew level wheeled swiftly on one
heel and snapped with sudden authority
your name david raven 

  stopping and lifting a surprised eye-
brow raven said however did you
guess

  dont be funny advised the ques-
tioner scowling

raven turned to charles his tones
were pained he tells me not to be
the star

funny do you think im funny

  yes responded charles youve
been that way since you fell on your
head at the age of three his bland
and stupid-seeming eyes shifted to the
ranger why do you want this person
named-er-

  theres money on his head dont
you use your spectroscreen
sometimes charles admitted
other times it bores me and i let it stay
dead

  the ranger commented to his com-
panions now you know why some folk
stay poor ignoring raven he con-
tinued with charles who was looking
suitably crushed

  hes wanted sooner than immediate-
ly for imperilling the lives of crew and
passengers of a space-ship opening an
airlock contrary to regulations inter-
fering with navigation refusing to obey
the lawful orders of a ships officer
landing in a forbidden area evading
medical examination on arrival evading
customs search on arrival refusing to
pass through the antibacterial steriliza-
tion chambers and- he drew a breath
asked one of the others was there any-
thing else

  spitting in the main cabin sug-
gested another who had long yearned to
do just that merely because a large
lettered notice warned him he mustnt

   i never spit asserted raven giving
him the cold eye

   shut op you ordered the first one
making it plain that he was taking no
backchat from anyone he switched to
charles preferring that worthys dumb-
ness if you happen to come across this
fellow ring westwood  and tell us
where he is well see that you get your
fair share of the take

charles was humbly grateful he
said to raven come on were late
already

  they walked off conscious that the
three were watching them the trios
undertone comments reached them in
the form of clear mental impulses

watchers	

  took us for rangers anyway

  lets hope some ranger captain does

too if we happen to meet one

   i still think lancombe is way off the
track theres a tambar joint two blocks
down so what say-

  why dont they dig up his picture
and distribute a few copies theres
more to this than has been advertised

  such as what

  perhaps wollencott wants him for
personal reasons

   look fellows theres a tambar joint

     ti

   all right well go there for half an
hour the mental stream started to
fade very slowly if wollencott wants
him-

  they continued talking about wollen-
cott until they dimmed beyond hearing
not one mentioned thorstern or so much
as gave that name a passing thought

  which was quite a tribute to the
brains of the owner of the name

xiii

black and ugly reared the great
basalt castle that was the home of thor-
stern it dated back to the earliest days
of settlement when smooth high walls
six feet thick were sure protection
against antagonistic jungle beasts of
considerable tonnage here the little
group of first-comers had stubbornly
clung until more shiploads built them up
in numbers and strength of arms suffi-
ciently to sally forth take land and hold
it

  but thorstern had stepped in
strengthened its neglected walls added
battlemented towers and turrets he
spent lavishly as though his calculated
obscurity in matters of power had to be
counterbalanced by blatancy in some
other direction the result was a sinis-
ter sable architectural monstrosity that
loomed in the thickening fog like the
haunt of some feudal maniac who held
a countryside in thrall

  raven stood toying thoughtfully with
the lobe of an ear while he studied it
	startling stories

  quite a fortress he remarked
what does he call it-the imperial
palace

  originally it was known as base
four charles told him thorstem re-
named it blackstone locally its re-
ferred to as the castle well what now
do we go in after him or wait for him
to come out

  well go in-in decent and civilized
manner raven decided through the
front gate after another look at their
objective he added you talk while i
hold your arm and let my tongue hang
out then well both look simple
thanks said charles in no way of-
fended strutting officiously up to the
huge gate he thumbed a bell push
waited with raven by his side

  four minds near by immediately ra-
diated four different but equally potent
oaths they were pawn minds all of
them there was not a mutant in the
bunch

  it was to be expected thorstern as
an individual without talent other than
that given by above average brains
would make full use of those blessed
with paranormal dexterities but would
not yearn for the pleasure of their com-
pany

tn these respects the lord of the black
castle ran as true to type as the low-
liest of his servitors it was a natural
psychological reaction based on the con-
cealed inferiority complex of homo
today in the presence of what looked
like homo tomorrow

  so it was a blue-jowled commonplace
pawn who opened a door in the thick
wall came out and peered through the
heavy bars of the gate he was squat
thick-shouldered irritable but suffici-
ently disciplined to conceal his ire
wanting someone

  thorstern charles answered

  its mister thorstern reproved the
other you got an appointment
no

  he wont see anyone without an ap-
pointment hes a busy man

  i am aware of the fact charles
gave back being so busy he will wish
to see us with the minimum of delay
the guard frowned his iq was
around  and he was steered mostly by
his liver

  well insisted charles fatly belli-
cose you going to keep us here come
monday week

  the other registered the baffled dis-
taste of a slow mind that hates being
pushed faster than it wants to-or can
-move maybe he had better do some-
thing about this the manifold ramifica-
tions of thorstern brought all sorts of
people to the gate at all times though
seldom as darkness fell

  licking his lips he asked in a hoarse
voice what are your names

  they dont matter said charles
  well whats your business

  that does matter

  heck i cant tell them just that
try it and see charles advised
hesitating the guard stared from one
to the other absorbed mental comfort
from both without knowing it went
back into the wall those in the tiny
room beyond greeted him with a chorus
of remarks that caused not a whisper
outside the door but did spike through
the basalt in neural waves and came
clearly to the pair waiting by the gate

  cripes youre holding up the
game

  who is it baxter someone impor-
tant

  they wont say was the guards
glum mutter picking the phone off the
wall he waited for its visiscreen to clear
and show who was responding at the
other end he made his tones suitably
apologetic two fellers at the gate say
they want to see mister thorstern
about what

  i dont know all theyll tell me is
that it matters

  thats their opinion the bosss may
be different

  yes sure baxter was in a quandry
i thought id better check up with you
whatll i tell them
the star

  that they can state their business
in specific terms or start fumbling their
way back home

  all right racking the phone he
threw the onlookers a pained glance
went into the rapidly gathering gloom
see here you two the-

  he stopped gaped outward beyond
the gate visibility was now down to a
mere four or five yards within that
small radius there was nobody nobody
at all

  hey he called into the wall of fog
no reply again much louder hey
nothing was to be heard but the dis-
mal drip of water and the dim subdued
mixture of sounds from the city three
miles away

  darn giving it up he returned to
the door a thought struck him just as
he reached it he came back and tried
the gate it was securely fastened he
glanced at its top the quadruple row of
spikes three inches from the overhead
rock made it completely impassible all
the same he had a moment of strange
uneasiness darn their hides he
repeated and went indoors

  darkness became complete the last
dim fadings of light were swept away as
if a gigantic shutter had been drawn
across the concealed sky behind the
gate there was a long narrow courtyard
where visibility was down to mere arms
length

the two invaders halted in their pro-
gress through the courtyard a large
bolt-studded door was set deeply in the
wall immediately to their right though
well hidden in the all-enveloping cloud
they knew the door was there and moved
closer to inspect it

  charles said they fitted that gate
with a highly complicated lock contain-
ing fourteen tricky wards then they
fitted the lock itself with an alarm
guaranteed to scream bloody murder the
moment anyone tried to tamper with it
finally they included a cutoff in the at-
tendants room so that the alarm would
not operate while he was seeing to a

watchers	

caller he gave a sniff of disdain
thats what i call cleverness carried
to the point of stupidity

  not necessarily raven differed
remember that they designed the lay-
out solely for coping with their own
kind mutant or nonmutant its quite
adequate for such a limited purpose
dealing with denebs-or the likes of
you and me-is quite another problem

  youre right of course that gate
comes nearer to the unbustable accord-
ing to this worlds rudimentary notions
of unbustability do you see what i
see

  yes theres a black-light beam
across the passage just behind the door
open the door and you break the beam
everything to delay us grumbled
charles impatient of time-wasting fu-
tilities youd think they had done it
deliberately

  well you trace the lines while i tend
to the door one man one job

  he got  with his part straightaway
it involved no more than standing with
hands in pockets and staring intently at
the obstacle meanwhile raven gazed
similarly at the thick rock to one side of
the door

  neither man said anything more
each concentrating on his own special
task they stood side by side unmoving
and stared to the front as if transfixed
by a supernatural apparition invisible to
others after a while charles relaxed
took his attention from the door but was
careful not to disturb the other

  half a minute later raven likewise
eased up and said it goes along a
corridor then down a passage to the
right and into a small anteroom the
switch made a loud click when it
snapped up but fortunately the room
was empty

  he braced a hand against the door
gave it a shove it swung inward
heavily without sound the two stepped
boldly through closed the door behind
them walked along a narrow corridor
illuminated by sunken ceiling lights
their manner had the casual confidence
	startling stories

of people who had purchased the castle
last week and planned to furnish it to-
morrow

  all this gives some indication of the
psychology of thorstern raven com-
mented the bolts and bars and tell-
tale beams could easily be detected by
any mutant endowed with first-class
esp but hed be unable to do anything
about them on the other hand a tele-
port could manipulate the lot without
any trouble-if only he could see them
so the place is wide open to a multi-
talented mutant such as a teleport with
esp thorstern proceeds on the as-
sumption that there is no such creature
hell hate to think hes wrong

  he isnt wrong

  not yet not today but someday he
may be that fellow haller was classi-
fied as a pyrotic and no more yet he
realized too much the moment i touched
him hed got a rudimentary form of
esp and didnt know it himself until
then hed got one and one-tenth tal-
ents

  a freak defined charles

  exactly so brother thorstern is
going to be anything but amiable when
confronted by two freakier freaks such
as ourselves

  thats a handicap considering that
ohr purpose is to persuade him to see
reason

  your finger is right on the sore spot
its not going to be easy to knock sense
into a powerful ruthless individual mo-
tivated by fear and its so much harder
when you dont want to show him why
his suppositions are wrong and his fears
groundless

  he let the subject drop as they
reached the end of the corridor turned
into the right-hand passage and found
three men walking toward them

xiv

b efore any one of this trio had
time to react to his suspicions raven
said brightly and with confidence that
disarmed pardon me which is the way
to mr thorsterns room

  he was answered by the middle one
who bore himself with a vague air of
authority first turn on the left sec-
ond door on the left

  thanks

  the three stood aside to let them pass
watched in silence as the invading pair
strolled casually by them but their
minds shouted their inmost thoughts

  any caller for thorstern is met at
the gate and conducted to his room
how come these two are ambling around
on their own never seen either of them
before

  something funny here pondered
the second one not usual for visitors
to be left on the loose i dont like it

  second door on the left eh gargan
thought fast when he gave them that
one the third was amused and un-
worried trust gargan always to play
safe thats why hes never got any-
where

  the first one who was gargan re-
sumed by deciding the moment they
get around that next bend ill give the
boss a warning buzz

  raven turned the corner threw
charles a knowing glance found the
second door on the left paused in front
of it

  i can pick up a hopeless tangle of
thought streams and not one that says
its coming from thorstern thats
natural of course since he wont spend
all his time thinking solely of himself
he nodded at the door but there are
no minds behind that the room is
empty the walls are solid rock the
door can be sealed by remote control

  the better mousetrap defined
charles

 a very empty mousetrap how-
ever

  shoving the door open raven walked
inside relaxed in a chair eyed the
blank screen

  charles took a seat beside him mak-
ing the chair squeak with his bulk he
likewise kept his attention on the screen
but his mind like ravens probed care-
fully in all directions
the star watchers	

flick went the door as relays op-
erated and a dozen hidden bolts slid
home the screen glowed to life swirled
and colored a swarthy face appeared

  so gargan was right what are you
two doing there

  sitting and waiting said raven

  i can see that youve not much
choice about it have you the face in
the screen registered a toothy and un-
pleasant smirk the guard at the gate
swears that nobody has been admitted
nevertheless you two are inside
theres only one answer to that-youre
a pair of hypnos see if you can hypno-
tize a screen

  you seem to think its a crime to be a
hypno said raven carefully kicking
the sore spot in a typical pawn mind

  its a crime for a hypno to use his
power for illegal purposes the other
retorted and in case you dont know
its a crime to break into private prem-
ises

  raven snapped in my considered
opinion its also a crime for a thick-
headed underling to amuse himself in-
dulging adolescent triumph and let his
own boss go hang his features hard-
ened weve come to talk to thorstern
better get him before someone paddles
some sense into you

  why you loud-mouthed marsh
stink began the other becoming livid
i could-

  you could what vinson inquired
a deep resonant voice which came clear-
ly from the cabinets speaker it is a
great mistake to lose ones temper to
whom are you speaking

  charles gave raven a gentle nudge
that sounds like the almighty thor-
stern himself

  not so almighty as he thinks he is
raven said

  the face in the screen had turned
sidewise become submissive and was
talking in apologetic tones its a
couple of skew boys sir they busted in
somehow weve got them pinned down
in room ten

  indeed the voice was rich calm

unhurried have they offered any rea-
son for such precipitate action 

  they say they want to talk to you
hm i dont see why i should bother
to gratify their desires do they think i
am at everybodys beck and call 
dont know sir

  the invisible speaker changed his
mind oh well since theyve got this
far i might as well hear what theyve
got to say theres a remote chance that
i might learn something useful
servilely vinson mouthed yes sir
the face slipped off the screen was
replaced by another big muscular
square-jowled thorstern was well past
middle age with a thick mop of white
hair and deep bags under his eyes but
still handsome in a virile way his
character was engraved upon those
broad features-intelligent ambitious

  his sharp blue eyes looked over
charles first taking in all details from
feet to head then moved to the other

  without the slightest evidence of sur-
prise or so much as a blink he said
dear me i know you only a couple
of minutes ago i received your picture
the name is david raven

  raven gazed back at him level-eyed
now why could you possibly want a
picture of me

  i did not want it riposted thor-
stern it was thrust upon me by our
authorities who on this planet at any
rate can lay fair claim to efficiency
your photograph is being circulated
apparently our police are most anxious
to get hold of you he harumphed to
clear his throat continued a person in
my position would be greatly embar-
rassed were he found harboring wanted
men therefore if you have anything to
say you had better say it quickly-be-
cause you havent got long

  after which

hphorsterns broad shoulders rose
- in an expressive shrug the gesture
was made in the manner of a roman
emperor turning his thumbs down

  the police will take you away and
	startling stories

my responsibility will cease

  youre quite a character raven re-
marked openly admiring him too bad
you insist on balling up the works it
makes our task so much the harder but
no less necessary

  what task

  to persuade you to call off the un-
declared war you are waging against
terra

  heavens above thorstern widened
his eyes in sardonic amazement do
you expect me to believe that terra
would send a petty criminal to inter-
view a mere business man about a
purely fanciful war

  there is a war and youre running
it

  what proof have you

  no proof is required said raven
  why not

  because you know it to be true even
though you dont choose to admit it
proof would be necessary only to con-
vince a third party there is no third
party present this is solely between
yourself and us two

  as one whose business and financial
ramifications are widespread said
thorstern becoming ponderous in-
evitably i have been the target of all
sorts of rumors and insults the jealous
and the spiteful are always with us but
i must admit that this bald and com-
pletely unsupported assertion of sur-
reptitious warmonering is the most
fantastic that has offended my ears to
date

  it is neither fantastic nor unsup-
ported raven contradicted unfor-
tunately it is a grim fact it doesnt
offend you either in fact you take
secret pride in it you are tickled to bits
because for once your well-publicized
dummy wollencott has failed to grab
the limelight

  wollencott echoed thorstern quite
unmoved i am beginning to see
things a little more clearly i presume
that wollencott-a melodramatic rabble
rouser if ever there was one-has
stamped on somebodys corns so youve

stupidly followed a false trail he has
laid and it brought you straight to me
charles stirred in his seat and
growled at the screen i am not in the
habit of smelling along false trails
no thorsterns gaze shifted ex-
amined him a second time again he
saw nothing but an obese individual
with a plump face and decidedly dull-
witted expression so you claim the
honor of identifying me as the prime
motive force behind an undeclared
war 

  if it can be called an honor

  then sir you are not only a crack-
pot but a dangerous one he made a
disparaging gesture i have no time
for crackpots it would be best to get
you off my hands and let the police deal
with you his face was severe as he
added coldly like a good citizen i have
the utmost confidence in our police
charles retorted you are referring
to those that happen to be in your pay
everyone on this planet has good reason
to fear them his lazy gaze sharpened
suddenly so that for the briefest mo-
ment he looked neither fat nor futile
except us

  you may yet find good reason to
change that opinion thorstern as-
sured he transferred his attention
back to raven i deny all your accusa-
tions and fhat is that if terra thinks
there is need to reassert her authority
over venus let her do so in the proper
quarter and in the proper way wollen-
cott is the man you want without a
doubt

  we arent interested in false fronts
raven told him if we snatch wollen-
cott you will laugh most heartily re-
place him with the next stooge on your
private list you wont lift a finger to
save wollencott because youll assign to
him the useful role of venusian nation-
alisms first martyr terra has some-
thing better to do than provide a petty
god with a few saints

  the said deity being me inquired
thorstern

  of course the sensible thing for us
the star watchers

to do is get at the man who operates the
puppets thats why weve come direct
to you the alternative is to accept the
fact that you are not amenable to reason
and cope with you in some other and
more effective manner

  that is a veiled threat thorstern
revealed strong white teeth it comes
strangely from one so completely at my
mercy

  enjoy yourself advised raven
its later than you think

  i am now beginning to doubt your
inherent criminality thorstern con-
tinued ignoring the remark i think
you are a case for a psychiatrist you
are motivated by a powerful obsession
that i emmanuel thorstern a prosper-
ous venusian trader am a kind of go-
liath to whom you must play the part
of david he glanced down at a desk
they could not see in the screen and
finished with considerable acidity yes
i see that your name actually is david
possibly you are conditioned by it

  not so much as you are by em-
manuel raven suggested

r produced the first visible re-
action on the others strong features
momentarily forsaking his determined
composure thorstern scowled then
rasped i have broken men for less than
that

  and the last laugh has been theirs
has it he lifted a heavy eyebrow
such people must have a most peculiar
way of laughing

  you didnt see enough you see only
what your eyes tell you they see and
thats your handicap the point is that
you may smash men but youll never
smash terra call off this war while yet
there is time

  or

  or terra will strike in her own way
like to know how

  im listening

  she will remove the oppositions key
men one by one starting with you
thorstern wasnt fazed neither was
he annoyed sweeping back his thick



mop of white hair with a quick motion
of his hand he consulted some papers
below the level of the screen and spoke
judicially

  my conscience being clear i have no
reason to be apprehensive of summary
removal furthermore we are all ter-
rans in law subject to the terran sys-
tem of jurisdiction which regards a
citizen as innocent until evidence of
guilt is forthcoming such evidence will
be impossible to produce especially in
the absence of certain witnesses includ-
ing yourselves

a counterthreat raven commented
construe it as you please you do not
seem to appreciate your own position
we know it we are trapped-you
hope

  you are in a room with solid walls
and devoid of windows the only door is
multiple locked by remote control and
cannot be unlocked except remotely it
is a room reserved for interviews with
paranormals of unknown power and un-
known purposes

  rather elaborate precautions for the
home of an honest trader arent they
raven asked

  i have elaborate interests to protect
the means i have detailed are not all by
a long chalk you have reached only the
second line of defense even in this room
from which i am speaking you would
find me invulnerable

  smiling o himself raven said it
would be nice to put that to the test
you will not be given the chance get
it into your slow-thinking minds that
ordinary men are not without ability
some of us-myself especially-know
how to deal with paranormals you can-
not read my mind can you you dont
know where i am in which direction or
how far away i may be within ten yards
of you my thought stream grounded by
an intervening wall of silver mesh or i
may be the other side of the planet

 sounds like youre scared of some-
one

  i fear nobody rasped thorstern
and was speaking truth but i do rec-
	startling stories

ognize the existence of powers denied
to me and therefore use prudence on
venus or mars one can do little else
our proportion of paranormals is high
a factor terra should take into account
before starting something she might not
be able to stop

  terra has mutants of her own
raven told him far more than you
suppose who carted the lot of you to
new planets in the first place the ter-
ran space-fleet which was and still is
manned by men whove spent anything
from fifteen to twenty years zooming
through the deep dark and absorbing
hard radiations many children of space-
dogs arent like other peoples children
ill take you up on that thorstern
felt the gratification of one about to
make an unanswerable point if as you
pretend there is a war being waged
why doesnt terra retaliate in kind with
her own mutants

  who said venus was using mutants
for her attacks raven asked sharply

thorstern spent one-tenth of a second
chiding himself for the obvious blunder
then covered up by asking in mock sur-
prise isnt that what is happening
no

  what then

  something a good deal worse the
nationalist underground movement is
using a new kind of undetectable ray to
sterilize our womenfolk

  thats a lie his voice was loud and
ireful his face slightly flushed

  of course it is admitted raven
without shame and you know it
youve just said so how do you know
no man could play so lousy a trick
secretly irked by his second successive
mistake thorstern decided he would
fake no more i am going to deal with
you as i would with any other menacing
crazies who break into my home

  if you can

  it will be absurdly easy every skew-
boy has exactly the same kind of lungs
as everyone else he goes to sleep as
swiftly and deeply even though he may
be a nocturnal he is as helpless in his

slumbers as any new-born babe
meaning you intend to gas us into
insensibility

  precisely agreed thorstern

  and you refuse to do anything about
stopping this war

  dont be silly i cannot admit that
there is a war much less that i have any
part of it i am treating you as unsavory
characters badly wanted by the police
and im going to ensure that they take
you away peacefully that is my duty
as a law-abiding citizen

  he leaned forward as if reaching for
something near the edge of the screen

xv

lready slumped low in his chair
charles suddenly slid down further
quietly undramatically his plump face
was pale his eyes closed

  raven stood up removing his atten-
tion from the man in the screen bend-
ing over charles he tugged him back
into sitting position slid a hand under
the packet and gently rubbed him over
the heart

   quite a diverting little byplay re-
marked thorstern still bent forward
but with his hand momentarily arrested
the fat boy plays sick you massage
his chest looking serious and worried
in a few moments youll tell me he will
die unless something is done mighty
quick i am then supposed to go into a
panic withhold the gas withdraw the
bolts and send somebody running to you
with a tambar bottle

  his back still turned to the screen
raven said nothing he remained over
charles holding him in the chair rub-
bing near to the heart

  well it wont work thorstern
practically spat out the words it is too
infantile a trick to deceive a halfwit be-
sides if that fat boys stroke did happen
to be genuine i would be quite content to
sit here and watch him die

  i am glad you said that raven did
not bother to look around people like
us frequently are handicapped by ethical
the star watchers	

considerations it is a characteristic
weakness we are weak where men like
you are strong

  thank you said thorstern with
sarcasm flattery will not avail you
either

  so it is quite a relief when prospec-
tive victims sweep all our qualms away
added raven he swung round looked
straight into the screen his eyes silver-
flecked and luminous goodby emman-
uel  some day we may meet again

  the other did not reply he was in-
capable of it his formerly powerful
features were now undergoing a series
of violent contortions still gently
chafing the flaccid body in the chair
raven watched without surprise thor-
stems tormented features dropped be-
low the level of the screen a hand
appeared grasping spasmodically the
face came back contorted in manner
harrowing to see all this had taken no
more than thirty seconds

  then the phenomenon departed as
swiftly as it had arrived the facial
muscles relaxed composed themselves
the countenance tidied itself though
still shining with perspiration the deep
voice spoke again cool calm collected
it appeared to be addressing a hidden
microphone somewhere to the left

  baxter my two visitors are about to
leave see that they are not obstructed

he reached forward touched a
stud and the door bolts slid back it
was his last deed in this existence for
the whole face changed again the mouth
fell open the head vanished from the
screen as the body gave way beneath it

  charles stirred as raven shook him
with great vigor opening his eyes he
shivered got to his feet teetered a little
and breathed heavily

  we must move fast david i thought
i had him but the cunning devil-

  i know come on

  he jumped to the door jerked it open
hustled charles through hurriedly they
passed through the area of the still in-
operative beam out through the door

and into the thick fog of the courtyard
the welter of surrounding thoughts lent
urgency to their feet

    so this coutch dancer comes on
like an educated snake    hes dead i
tell you    take more than a hotsy to
set fire to that dump    ivas reaching
for the gas-stud when they got him
somehow heaven knows how   story
goes that someone was on jupiter a
couple of years back but i reckon its an-
other terran rumor because   hardly
at the gate yet get the siren going  
shoot on sight 

  baxter surely as ever was waiting at
the gate bad visibility prevented his
recognizing them until they were close
and then his eyes popped wide

  you howd you get in

  is it any business of yours raven
gestured at the steel barrier obey or-
ders and open up hurry were pressed
for time

  are you now baxter paused one
hand on the lock and glowered at them
whos doing this job you or me
me said raven he punched baxter
on the nose licked his knuckles sorry
chum

  there had been plenty of vim and
weight behind the blow the guard went
down and lay there making bubbling
noises turning the lock raven flung
the gate open youve done enough
he told charles time you went home
not likely charles gave him a
knowing look the gaping gate is a gag
otherwise you wouldnt have smacked
down that noisy sleeper so youre going
back inside he began to retrace his
steps into the courtyard doing it at a
fast waddle and so am i

  then the alarm sounded it was an
electric siren located high above the
battlements beginning with a low and
eerie moan it speeded up to an ear-
splitting screech that ripped through the
fog echoed and re-echoed across the sur-
rounding countryside

  the two hastened through the en-
veloping cloud that pressed damply on
their faces created pearls of moisture
	startling stories

in their hair and trailed streakily behind
them in thin wisps that resembled fine
wool at the farther end of the court-
yard well beyond the door they had
previously entered was a narrow stone
archway with a lantern dangling from
its center a lantern obviously intended
more for ornament than utility that
was the impression it gave and was in-
tended to give it hung in ornate inno-
cence and cast a thin fan of black light
on a row of pinhead-sized cells set in
the step beneath the arch

  the siren was still wailing as raven
sought to trace the leads from this de-
ceitful setup finally he stepped
through the arch charles following a
moment later the siren ceased its clamor
dying out with a horrid moan the en-
suing hush was disrupted by angry
voices coupled with a host of equally
wrathful thought forms

  would have taken longer than id
liked to bust that beam raven re-
marked the lines run all over the shop
and back through a large switchboard
however i was lucky

  in what way

  breaking the beam vibrates a visible
telltale and nobody was watching it at
the moment there seems to be quite a
panic inside

  he stood close to the wall peered
around the corner and through the arch
toward the gate a scuffling of many feet
could be heard in the gloom a jabber of
voices each trying to overshout the
others it was easier to listen to their
minds

  too late gates open here he is flat
out well you three were in the room
what were you doing when he got
conked playing jimbo hear that any
skewboy can bust in or out while these
lazy bums play jimbo lets after em
howre we going to do that feeling our
way like blind men think weve got
radar vision  not on your life i tell you
theyre skewboys and multitalented at
that

  they wont be so hot someone said
when we catch em

harles whispered if i were like
 them id hate the guts of people like
us

  they do and i dont blame them
raven gestured for silence listen

  aw have it your own way im going
after them they cant get away without
making noises and im going to shoot at
noises and ask questions afterward
coming along sweeny what i call a
really talented feller is one who can
digest a lump of lead

  the thoughts of these pursuers faded
as their minds turned to the task of lis-
tening to fugitive feet those remaining
by the gate were still trying to revive the
stricken baxter another jumble of
neural waves was radiating from inside
the castle

  nothing to show what killed him
seems like his heart just stopped i tell
you it was sheer coincidence no hypno
can operate through a scanner much
less cause his subject to die then
whyd he draw the bolts and order the
gate open he was hypnoed good and
proper i tell you and through a scanner
at that those two guys have got some-
thing nobody human ought to have

  you did well there charles mur-
mured with approval when you
scowled into the screen at precisely the
right moment it put them clean off the
track theyre putting all the blame on
you

  id hate them to get on the right
track

  yes so would i the plump face
puckered as charles went on if only
there were some way of telling them
things without giving it to the denebs
for free

 there isnt theres no way no way
at all

  i know he went quiet again lis-
tened to the other minds

  you called plain city yet yes
theyve a bunch on the way the boss
will have fourteen fits when he gets back
and hears all about this

  there you are raven nudged the
other what we wanted to know thor-
the star

sterns not here but is expected that
fellow in the room looked nothing like
thorstern by the time you were using
him a malleable eh

  i knew it the moment i made con-
tact said charles becoming dis-
gruntled again it came like a shock
but it was nothing to the shock i gave
him

   hell have got over it now death is
quite a considerable relief to the feel-
ings he gave a quiet laugh isnt it
ignoring the question charles con-
tinued he was a guy named greatorex
and one of the only three mutants per-
mitted in the place theyve been trained
to impersonate thorstern to such per-
fection that it becomes second nature
thats why he talked about being invul-
nerable in the room the big boss him-
self was invulnerable simply because he
wasnt there

  where are the other pair did his
mind tell you

   somewhere in the city taking it easy
until theyre wanted

  humph you can see what that
means if thorstern is due back and
doesnt know whats happened hell
probably come in person but if some-
body has made contact and given him all
the details he may play safe by handing
us another malleable listen to this fel-
low  hes getting ideas

  it was coming through the wall all
right the gate was open and one of those
dopy guards put down does that mean
theyve taken it on the run maybe
theyre still hanging around i say we
ought to search this dump and the
sooner the better

  a thinner more impatient mind an-
swered youre crammed to the ears
with ifs buts and supposings i can do
plenty of that myself when ive nothing
better to do for instance suppose they
happen to be supermalleables wliat
then youve not only got to find out
where they are but also who they are
heck one of them might have bloodied
his own beak laid flat and had a hard
time keeping his face fixed while kidding

watchers	

the lot of us that he is baxter a brief
pause then come to that how do you
know that i am me

  raven grumbled some folks lack the
ability to leave well enough alone
that comes well from you observed
charles indulging in a fat smile

  i asked for it raven stared again
into the courtyard surveyed surround-
ing walls the hunt is on weve no
choice but to try to dodge them until
either thorstern or his image arrives

xvi

dodging wasnt so difficult raven
and charles sat in the thick all-conceal-
ing mist atop a blank battlemented wall
some forty feet high a tree-cat might
have scented them up there a chirrup-
ing supersonic could have got a stream
of echoes from them even a floater
could have found them by obeying hi
natural instinct to snoop where pawns
could not

   but the hunters were men in the ordi-
nary everyday sense of the term they
had their limitations as has every other
life form great or small for the great
are within other different and often in-
conceivable limits just as binding just
as restricting although in a wider sense

  to these pawn minds a mutant was a
kind of vaudeville character who had
gone too far developed delusions of
grandeur and mijht at any time unite
with ruthless prototypes to make slaves
of normal men a multitalented mutant
was infinitely worse a nonhuman crea-
ture disguised in human shape and
theoretically capable of anything any-
thing at all

  the notion of being suddenly con-
fronted by a biological monstrosity
which was hypno-telepath-pyrotic-what-
ever all rolled into one with no handi-
caps other than the sole inability to out-
jump a bullet was too much for two of
the searchers

  one went through the archway point-
ing a peculiar hand lamp on the studs to
keep them activated he sought futilely
	startling stories

around the area his eyes wide his back
hairs erect and passed a couple of times
right under the feet of the quarry before
he gave up and went out

  another emerged from the courtyard
door caught the vague sound of move-
ment looked toward the arch the two
approached carefully hesitantly until
each saw a form looming in the fog

  both barked whos that and trig-
gered simultaneously

  one missed the other got a slug in
his left arm the sound of shots stirred
the edgy castle still further somebody
in the distance far beyond the gate fired
vertically and plugged a darker patch of
fog that was anything but man-shaped
the ether became full of abuse

  according to what i hear there has
been a large number of questionable
marriages in the past raven leaned
forwaid stared past his dangling feet

  i hear something else charles
glanced upward do you 

  yes someones coming ive got a
feeling that its the man we want

  the sound was a superswift whup-
wkup-whup as of giant vanes whirling
at considerable altitude the copter was
coming from the east flying high above
the night fog

 thin orange-colored ray shot from
a corner turret of the castle spiked
upward through the cloud and gleamed
steadily the noise of vanes grew louder
as the oncoming machine lowered to-
ward the beacon a minute later it was
directly overhead

  guided either by its own instruments
or radioed instructions from the ground
the copter lowered into the mist boldly
descended through it landed on the
graveled area outside the gate the
orange beam cut off several pairs of
feet ran through the courtyard and out
the gate toward the new arrival

  now to join the deputation edging
off the stonework raven dropped the
forty feet to ground he did not drift
down like a floater he fell in the same
manner with which he had plunged into

the forest a swift and normal fall
checked by last-minute deceleration
charles followed in exactly the same un-
canny way

  there was a minor uproar of voices
and accompanying thought forms com-
ing from the direction of the shrouded
copter a dozen men all trying to talk at
once two of the gate guards were
lounging outside their post and looking
toward the tumult with such intentness
that neither took much notice of the
vaguely outlined pair who hastened
through the gate

  the escaping pair went only a little
way toward the machine just far
enough for the fog to hide them from
the watchers by the gate at that point
they took a half circle that brought them
near the copter on the side farthest from
the castle

  a man grim-faced and gimlet-eyed
was standing at the top of the copters
landing ladder he looked like the twin
brother of the unfortunate greatorex

  the minds of those talking to him re-
vealed a most curious situation not one
knew with any degree of certainty
whether thorstern himself had died and
they were now reporting the fact to a
dummy or whether a substitute had
suffered and they were telling thor-
stern himself or another substitute

  with masterful cunning the would-be
dictator of a world had been frank with
them let them in on his scheme of quad-
rupling himself then drilled them to
accept any obvious thorstern as the
real thorstern

  the trick was useful in the extreme
no mind probe could detect a substitu-
tion in the brain of anyone serving the
poseur neither could any of the lead-
ers rank and file be tempted to take a
crack at him in person knowing that the
odds were three to one against nailing
the right man and that vengeance was
sure to follow

  but for once the man atop the lad-
der was caught napping no silver
mesh screen insured the privacy of his
mind he was in the open and prima-
the star watchers	

rily concerned with getting a fair idea
of what had happened within his hide-
out

  his mind admitted that he was in-
deed thorstern and no other a fact
that would have lent comfort to the
gripers now before him had there been
a m among them already he was
concerned with the notion of returning
to plain city to speed up the hunt and
of sending another impersonator back
to the castle to take the full brunt of
any second blow that might be made

  then this guy glared straight at
him as if to say i hope you drop
dead  continued the frontmost talk-
er upon which he did just that
when a couple of things that arent
human can waltz straight in and-
through the gate through the
alarm system and everything else
contributed a second then top it by
walking out of a locked room

  a third voiced exactly what was in
the listening mans mind- what gives
me the willies is the fact that if they
can do it once they can do it again-
and maybe more besides

  thorstern backed half a step
youve searched the place thorough-
ly

  every inch boss couldnt find hair
nor hide of them we called for some
help from town theyre sending some
pussies and a gang of skewboys fight
fire with fire

  as if in confirmation there came
from far away the faint irritable
yowling of haltered tree-cats

  theyll do a fat lot of good opined
the first too pessimistic to care who
knew it not unless they happen to
meet raven and the fat chump on the
way theyve had a long start by now
thorstern felt he had heard enough
and came to a decision in view of all
thib id better go back to town ill
return immediately im satisfied every-
things being done that can be done-
expect me back in a couple of hours
time or three at most

  he said it straight-faced knowing

that he had not the slightest intention
of returning so long as it might be at
his personal peril another would
double for him on his next appearance

  if any more come asking for me
tell them im away yon dont know
where if a caller proves to be this
raven again or looks a little bit like
him talks or acts like him or gives you
reason to think hes animated by simi-
lar ideas dont argue or give him a
chance use your guns on him and use
them effectively i will accept full
responsibility should anyone make a
mistake

  with that he stepped into the copter
with an air of self-confident delibera-
tion which concealed his inward desire
to get away fast he was shaken
though he took every care not to show
it

he growled at the pilot get go-
ing and lay back in his seat his
mood was one of worried introspec-
tion

  the vanes whirled the machine
bounced a little rocked slightly and
went up raven and his companion
went up with it by the simple method
of stepping close and hooking a leg
over the wheel braces formerly hid-
den from view of the talkers by the
copters intervening bulk they became
momentarily visible as they soared a
group of startled faces got a good look
at them for two or three seconds be-
fore they disappeared into the ground-
hugging cloud reaction was angry
and confused

  quick gimme that gun- quick i
say you got ten thumbs

  easy meaghan you might hit the
boss

  or the pilot dyou want a ton of
metal dropped on your crust

  got to do something darn these
skewboys i

  phone the city again theyll shoot
em off the undercarriage as it de-
scends

  this is where a couple of well-
	startling stories

armed floaters might do some good
why not-

  stick around dillworth in case the
pilot smells a rat and comes down
the speaker perked his ears caught
the still rising whup-tvhup-ivhup no
hes carrying on stick around all the
same

  where are you going

  inside ill contact the boss on the
radio and tell him whats underneath
good idea a shower of slugs will
blow them off their perch

  the copter came out of the cloud
into bright starlight and the shine
from a mock moon called terra they
had emerged from the haze at nine
hundred feet daytimes it rose to a
minimum of forty thousand leaving
the ground dull but clear

  heading directly for the plain city
beacon the pilot was content to skim
over the fog there was no point in
gaining more altitude during so short
a run subconsciously he sensed that
the machine was less lively than it had
been an hour ago but he wasnt wor-
ried about it at night the atmospheres
oxygen content varied from hour to
hour and tended to make his motors
seem temperamental

 he was already over the city when
the radio beeped and he put out a hand
to switch on his mike at the same time
the door opened and raven stepped in-
side

  good evening he said to thor-
stern very pleasantly

  with his hand still hovering over the
switch the pilot threw a hurried
glance through the windshield to con-
firm that he really was airborne then
growled how the blue blazes-
stowaway reporting sir raven
grinned at him and theres another
one outside riding the rods a much
bulkier one he turned his attention
to thorstern followed that persons
intent gaze to a side pocket i
shouldnt if i were you he advised

  deciding that its for bosses to do the
bossing the pilot flipped his switch

and snapped well

  a voice drummed from the tiny
speaker tell mr thorstei-n to grab
a gun and put a dozen slugs through
the floor- those two guys are squatting
on the undercarriage

  he knows said the pilot

  good grief the voice said in an
aside to someone else the boss al-
ready knows then it asked thepilot
whats he done about it

  the pilot turned inquiringly to
thorstern who sat cold-eyed stony-
faced uttering not a word

  nothing the pilot reported

  you dont mean- the others ris-
ing tones suddenly cut off and there
came a sharp click as the distant trans-
mitter closed down

  hes jumping to conclusions ob-
served raven he thinks youre both
out of the fight and that hes been talk-
ing to me

  and who may you be asked the
pilot his tone suggesting that only
hobos came aboard in mid-air

  thorstern spoke for the first time
keep out of this jessop theres
nothing you can do

  his bothered brain provided an in-
teresting example of how inconsequen-
tial thoughts sometimes come upper-
most in times of crisis he was in a
jam and judging by what had occur-
red at the castle it was a very tight
one

but all he thought of at that mo-
ment was an antigrav cab has a
load limit of five hundred pounds a
copter can haul more than a ton if
id used an antigrav i wouldnt be in
this fix after this no more copters for
me not unless ive got an escort
youve got an escort-my friend
and myself raven pointed out he
shoved the door open come on were
stepping out

  thorstern stood up slowly id
break my neck

  youll be all right well have hold
of you
the star watchers	

  whatfs to stop your letting go

  not a thing

  thorsterns mental reaction was
he can hypnotize me into doing any-
thing he wishes anything at all even
to dying by remote influence through
a scanner it would be better to do
things of my own free will i can bide
my time other circumstances provide
other opportunities

  thats being sensible raven ap-
proved stay with us until we blunder
then you can tear our hearts out

  i know youre a m and can treat
my mind like an open book thorstern
moved toward the door and more be-
sides theres nothing i can do about it
-yet

  he braced himself as raven backed
out ahead of him grasped an arm and
charles reached up to take the other
thorstern had brains and a good deal
of animal courage but his whole
nature rebelled against a leap into
space with a parachute or antigrav
belt he would not have hesitated for a
moment with no more than other
hands grasping him it wasnt so good

  so he closed his eyes and held his
breath as they left the copter and
plummeted down he was conjuring
visions of a rocky wall or tilted roof
rocketing from the whiteness to smash
his legs and break his body when a
powerful pull on both arms slowed
him down a gable end rose from the
mist brushed his feet then he landed
in a street

  par overhead the pilot was gabbling
into his transmitter couple of fellers
took him out i took it for granted they
were floaters but they went down like
stones there was something mighty
queer about the whole business he
went without wanting to but he went

  raven said your friend jessop is
on the police band and screaming for
help

   i dont think it will be of much use
thorstern looked around trying to
identify his surroundings in the dim
light but no matter

  becoming fatalistic

  i accept circumstances that are
temporarily beyond my power to
change i have learned to wait no
game goes wholly in ones favor all the
time it is the last and final move that
counts

  the statement was devoid of mis-
placed confidence or braggadocio it
was the voice of experience the con-
sidered opinion of one whose com-
plicated plans frequently had suffered
obstructions delays setbacks all of
which had been overcome next week
next month or the following year he
was admitting that this unlucky night
he was beaten and if he died would be
finished for keeps but he was also warn-
ing them that while he lived there was
always tomorrow

xvii

mavis opened the door and let
them in without being summoned by
a knock or ring expressing neither
pleasure nor surprise she had the mat-
ter-of-fact air of one who has kept
completely in touch with events and
knew exactly what was happening
from moment to moment

  in the manner of a mother mildly
reproving a small and wayward child
she said to charles you are going to
regret this i feel it coming then she
went into the kitchen

  now weve got still another type of
mutant grumbled charles- he
flopped into a chair making its seat
bulge down between the legs a prog-
nosticator

  thorstern stared after her in open
approval and remarked its a pleas-
ure to hear someone talking sense
everyone talks sense according to
his or her particular lights each man
is his own oracle raven shoved a
pneumaseat toward him sit down
you dont have to play statues just be-
cause youre in bad company

  the other sat already he was striv-
ing to drive away a series of thoughts
	startling stories

that insisted on coming back he was
anxious not to nurse them because they
could be seen whenever these two saw
fit to peer inside his skull and for all
he knew they were peering without
cease so he tried to swat the thoughts
as one would swat half a dozen annoy-
ing flies but they hung around and
kept buzzing

  this pair of multis can protect their
thoughts probably the woman can
also but i cant hide my own and
doubt whether they can shield them
for me the patrols already will be
scouring the streets some concentrat-
ing on this neighborhood theyll in-
clude whatever telepaths can be dug up
at this late hour- so unless this room
has built-in screens to give it privacy
theres a fair chance that some passing
mind probe will recognize my thought
stream and identify its source

giving raven a surly eye he said
ive jumped out in midair ive
sat down when told ive obeyed orders
what next

  a talk

  its two in the morning you could
have talked tomorrow by appointment
and at a reasonable hour he pursed
his lips was there any need for all
this preliminary melodrama

  unfortunately yes youve made it
hard to gain contact you and the
organization over which you preside
meaning my extensive trading in-
terests nonsense seems to me youre
animated by a persecution complex
weve been through all this before
didnt you get a record of our con-
versation with your very accomplished
impersonator

  much as he would have liked to deny
all knowledge of any troubles thor-
stern was too wise to let himself utter
something that was simultaneously
contradicted by his mind

  so he said truthfully ive not yet
had the details of what you said to
greatorex all i do know is that hes
dead and you had a hand in it i dont

like it eventually you wont like it
either

  charles emitted a loud sigh and in-
terjected thats a nice vivid satisfy-
ing picture of people hanging by their
necks your imagination operates in
full colors a few of the details are in-
accurate though the knots are in the
wrong place and i dont possess two
left feet

  do i have to endure criticism in ad-
dition to mental prying thorstern
asked raven

  he couldnt resist it sadistic pleas-
ures ask for adverse comment raven
paced to and fro the prisoners gaze
following under the delusion that
greatorex was really you we asked
him to stop cutting off terras toes we
gave him fair warning that toe-cutting
is something the victim has every right
to resent he insisted on playing the
tune as before superb as his act
proved to be he was hamstrung
why asked thorstern watching
it was not within his power to make
a major decision on your behalf
knowing you he didnt dare by virtue
of his peculiar position he was without
the initiative that could have saved
him he made a that-is-that gesture
and so hes dead

  for which youre now sorry
sorry raven turned toward him
eyes bright with silver motes in their
iris certainly not we couldnt care
less

  it sent a most unpleasant feeling
down thorsterns back when there
was a highly desirable end in view he
could be decidedly cold-blooded him-
self but never did he display it with
such open callousness

  seems there are others who enjoy
sadistic pleasures he stabbed quite
reasonably

  you misunderstand we are not
happy about the matter but neither do
we grieve you can call it splendid in-
difference

  practically the same thing this
was an opportune moment to catch the
the star watchers	

ears of a patrol if one were near i
dont know how you did it but i call it
murder

  mavis came in with the percolator
and cups she poured three set out a
plate of biscuits

  our visitor is talking about mur-
der charles told her his chuckle was
fat and hearty know what it means
giving him a look of mock menace
she retorted some day i hope to and
retired again to the kitchen

  murder isnt funny stated thor-
stern

  not to those left weeping raven
agreed the victim himself never
seems to mind again the strangely
penetrating examination ever no-
ticed how little resentment is shown by
the dead

  ive noticed theyre sometimes
avenged by the living

  it is imaginary vengeance some
cannot smell blood without thirsting
for more

  that was an obtuse crack at himself
thorstern felt an undeserved one
whatever else he might be he was not
a bloodthirsty monster true he was
running what whining terrans saw fit
to call a war but which was in reality
a liberation movement a few killings
had been inevitable he had approved
only those absolutely necessary to for-
ward his designs and those he had
duitfully deplored he wa-by far the
most humane conqueror in history

  would you care to explain that re-
mark if you are accusing me of
wholesale slaughter id like you to
state one instance one specific case
there are only individual cases in
the past the major atrocities are
located in the future if you consider
them absolutely essential and if you
live that long

  another prognosticator com-
mented charles this time completely
without humor indeed he made it
smack of grim foreboding-

  ignoring him raven continued
only you know how true that is how

far you are prepared to go how great
a cost you are willing to pay-and
exact-to boss a world of your own it
is written in the depths of your mind
it stands out in letters of fire no price
is too high

there was no immediate response
thorstern could find nothing to say
he knew what he wanted he wanted it
cheaply and with as little trouble as
possible but if tough opposition
jacked the price sky-high in terms of
cash or lives it would still be paid
with regrets but paid

  at the present moment he was in the
hands of this bellyaching pair they
could write paid to his stubborn am-
bitions once and for all and in the only
way it could be done by making him
share the fate of greatorex

  so far theyd been queerly hesitant
about taking this drastic short cut
preferring to argue with him first for
the life of him-or the death of him-
he could not decide whether their cal-
lousness was advertised to conceal an
underlying squeamishness or whether
it was backed up by the same glowing-
eyed cruelty with which a cat tediously
torments a mouse it is going to eat
anyway

  his attention wandered toward the
door stealthily in the hope that none
would notice but he could not sup-
press concomitant thoughts if a patrol
overheard that talk of murder they
would not necessarily bust in at once
they might first go for more help of a
formidable kind

  raven was still talking although the
other was only half-listening if your
nationalist movement really was no
more than a means of gaining self-
government for venusians we could
find it in us to sympathize despite the
violence of its methods- but it isnt
that it is designed to gain you the
power you love poor little crawling
creeping grub

  eh thorsterns attention snap-
ped back
	startling stories

  i said youre a poor little crawling
creeping grub hiding from the light
squirming around in the dark and pa-
thetically afraid of a thousand things
including anonymity so you yearn for
petty predominance over a colony of
similar grubs during a mere heart beat
in the span of time and then you are
gone dust into dust an empty name
in a useless book mouthed by myopic
historians and cursed by weary school
children i suppose you call that im-
mortality

  it was too much thorstern had a
thick hide but it was thin in one spot
he could not stand being regarded as
a no-account a piker a comparative
seeker of butts on the sidewalk he
could not endure being small

  his broad face livid he shot to his
feet thrust a hand in a pocket took out
three photographs and flung them on
the table for the first time his voice
was vibrant with emotion

  youve some good cards and they
tickle you pink but ive seen them
here are a few of mine- not all youll
never see the rest

xvm

shaven picked up the top photo-
graph and studied it it was a blown-
up snapshot of himself rather old and
not very good but good enough

  its on the spectroscreen every
-hour stated thorstern with savage
satisfaction reproductions are being
issued to patrols as fast as they can be
turned out the tougher you get with
me the tougher youll make it for your-
self you pranced into this world de-
spite plans to grab you on arrival see
if you can get out of it the same way
it wont prove so easy he switched to
charles and the same applies to you
gutsy

  it doesnt i dont intend to run
away charles settled himself lower
in the chair im quite comfortable
here venus suits me as much-or as
little-as any other ball of dirt be-

sides my work is here 

  what work

  that said charles is something
you wouldnt understand

  he walks dogs and is ashamed to
admit it raven said tossing the
picture onto the table he picked up the
second glanced at it his features
went taut flourishing it in front of
the other he demanded what did you
do to him

  me nothing 

  you did it by proxy others did the
dirty work for you by order

  i gave no specific instructions
thorstern contradicted i told them
only to pick up steen and make him
tell what had occurred so they did
and enjoyed the doing by the looks
of it raven was annoyed and showed
it now steen is dead through no
fault of his own i dont mind that any
more than he minds it

  dont you

  no his end doesnt matter a hoot
it would have come eventually though
he lived to be a hundred with a jerk
of disgust he flipped the photograph
aside what i do dislike is the obvious
fact that he died slowly thats un-
forgivable his eyes glowed with sud-
den fires it will be remembered
again thorstern felt a cold shiver
he was not afraid-it wasnt within
him to admit to fear-but to himself he
conceded a certain degree of apprehen-
sion he had played a card hoping it
would serve as a dire warning perhaps
it had been a mistake

  they exceeded my orders he was
making a feeble attempt to pass the
buck i administered a most serious
reproof

  he reproved them raven told
charles how nice

  they pleaded that he was stubborn
and made them go farther than they
realized thorstern decided it might
pay to enlarge on this subject while it
was hot no rescue party had responded
to his talk about murder maybe some-
one would pick up his dissertation on
the star watchers	

steen any form of hollering would
serve so long as it brought results

tte went on they used a telepath
aa from a safe distance so steen
couldnt make a dummy of him it was
no use so they had to persuade him to
mull over whatever made him pull a fast
one on us he didnt want to by the
time he became cooperative theyd over-
done the persuading theyd gone too
far theyd made the whole thing use-
less

  meaning

  his mind was turned same as hal-
lers he gabbled a lot of crazy stuff
and passed out for keeps

  and what was the crazy stuff

  he said you were an entirely new
redoubtable and completely unsuspected
type of mutant youve a detachable
ego youd swapped bodies with him
against his will i checked with several
of our leading authorities on paranor-
mal aptitudes they declared it ludi-
crous but they knew why steen told it
what was their diagnosis

  hed been hopelessly out-hypnoed by
one of his own type far more powerful
than himself you made steen think he
was you for a short time you made
him send haller off balance at which
point the delusion ran out now limited
as i am i can do some mind-reading of
my own youre thinking that if i dont
play your way youll put the same sort
of bee on me

  will i

  either that or dispose of me out-
right as you did greatorex whichever
course you take will be futile if you fix
me up like steen itll wear off while if
you finish me completely youll have a
mere body on your hands a body cant
call off a so-called war ill be less con-
cerned than is greatorex a notion
struck him and he demanded how did
you put paid to greatorex what did
you do to him

  the same as well be compelled to do
to you once were convinced theres no
alternative raven stared hard at the

other get it into your mulish head
that weve far fewer compunctions than
you when it comes to dealing with an
obstacle we differ from you only in
that we make it swift we dont let the
subject linger that is the real crime
to prolong the act of dying he paused
finished greatorex went so fast he
hardly had time to fight it steen was
denied that fundamental mercy

  i told you-

  raven brushed the words aside
youre not going to make venus your
personal property and sometime in the
future help the martians hold terra to
ransom in her hour of trial if humanity
ever gets in a tight corner its going to
be humanity thatll fight its way out not
just terrans so youll cease all action
against terra and get the martians to
follow suit alternatively youll be re-
moved from the scene forever after
which well deal similarly with your
successors one by one until the whole
movement collapses for lack of leader-
ship he pointed to the tiny radium
chronometer in the ring on thorsterns
middle finger youve five minutes to
make up your mind

  ive more than that much more ive
got just as long as i like he poked the
third photograph across the table
take a look at that

  not picking it up raven bent over
to see it his expression did not change
in the slightest

  who is it asked charles too leth-
argic to get up and look or exercise
any other visual sense

  leina said raven

  thorstern laughed it was a grating
sound he was enjoying his own fore-
sight to the full in particular he was
pleased with his success in keeping his
mind away from the subject of leina
until this moment not once had she
drifted through his brain again a
pawn had outthought a mutant

  your woman he mouthed with un-
concealed scorn thats all i can call
her since youre not married to her
rather unconventional arent you
	startling stories

  decidedly agreed raven

  well we know plenty about her we
know her habits movements aptitudes
we know for instance that shes
another superior breed of hypno like
yourself steen said so he wasnt ly-
ing not in that condition maybe thats
the attraction between you i cant im-
agine any other unless youre fond of
elephants and-

  leave her proportions out of this
get to the point

  the point is said thorstern un-
able to resist showing relish that the
moment i die or go nuts or obviously
out of character- he tapped the pic-
ture with a heavy finger-she pays
thats a laugh said raven

  i hope youll enjoy it when you find
her dead

  i wont weep raven assured it
was by no means sardonic he made it
true dreadfully true

rpven thorstern thought it horrible

  he looked uncertainly at charles
seeking confirmation in that persons re-
vulsion and found him mooning boredly
at the ceiling his gaze came back to
raven it showed disbelief incredulity
she can die slowly

  do you think so

  i am positive of it unless she hap-
pens to have a weak heart she can take
ten times longer than steen how dyou
like that

  i think it disgusting

  eh

  the master mind the mighty con-
queror hides behind a womans skirts

  back came the old fury at belittle-
ment but thorstern managed to sup-
press it and say that comes well from
someone willing to let a woman pay for
his sins

  she wont mind smiled raven
giving him a quite unexpected angle

youre mad declared thorstern
beginning to believe it
greatorex doesnt mind neither
does haller and steen is coldly in-
different why should leina care why

even you-

  shut up you murderous maniac
thorstern surged to his feet both fists
clenched until the knuckles showed
white youve left it too long you were
so cocky you wanted to chew the fat all
night and weve been overheard see
youre not the only ones who can poke
his nose into other peoples business
weve been overheard he made an
ecstatic wave toward the front hear
those feet twenty of them fifty a
hundred the whole city has been
roused

  too bad said raven watching him
with a sardonic eye

  take me and see what it buys you
invited thorstern full of guts in a
moment the rush will come after which
youll get what youve earned trying
to look at raven and at the same time
watch the front he added with empha-
sis unless i am in complete possession
of myself and order them to hold their
hands

  it appears that were in a bad fix
commented charles he bleared in fat
reproof youll be the death of me
yet he fastened an anticipatory gaze
on the door

  thorstern was now standing with
compressed lips while his mind ran its
own untrammeled course they wont
try anything now the cost is too
great

  momentarily undecided about the re-
spective merits of pseudolegal and ac-
cidental methods of disposing of these
enemies jubilant over the crafty way in
which hed turned the tables on them he
braced himself for the coming inrush
and had completely forgotten that his
mind was wide open not that it mat-
tered now

  like charles his full attention was
on the door beyond which he had heard
the cautious scuffling of many feet

  he stiffened noting from a comer of
his eye that neither of the others had
moved teleportatively manipulated
the lock began to turn slowly and ap-
parently of its own accord
the star watchers	

xix

mnch by inch the door began to open
a yellowish coil of night fog came
through the gradually widening gap
there was utter silence within the
room not even the whispering of a
drawn breath this and tke doors slow
motion created an immense tension that
was almost more than thorstern could
stand

  his eyes were straining his ears
shocked by the total lack of expected up-
roar his mind trying to operate along
ten channels at once who was outside
did they have weapons ready fingers
taut triggers already partway back
if he made a mad jump for that open-
ing would he leap into a deadly volley
and go down for ever

  or had they a telepath to inform
them of his intentions so that theyd
hold their fire but of course a tele-
path could not warn them since he was
still hesitating to take a chance a
mind probe could tell what he was
thinking and still be unable to forecast a
split-second decision

  the few seconds had crawled like
eons as he watched the door which now
had ceased its motion halfway and re-
mained ajar why the devil were they
waiting

  more fog sneaked in he noticed it
for the first time and was smitten by a
plausible solution gas so they wanted
him to stay put until he collapsed along
with his captors then theyd enter re-
vive him and give him the other pair
to kick

  it was possible that raven and the fat
one knew what was coming it had
sparked brightly within his mind and
they must have caught it unless theyd
been too busy probing the think boxes
outside can a telepath deal with more
than one brain at a time can he search
several simultaneously thorstern
wasnt certain

  his nostrils tried to detect the invisi-
ble weapon though he knew that almost
certainly it would be odorless there

should be other signs eagerly he
studied himself alert for symptoms
and waited a mere half minute that he
could have sworn was a half hour then
he broke

  with an agonized bellow of dont
shoot dont shoot he sprang into the
doorway its me its thor- his
voice died away

gazing stupefied into the shrouded
night he posed there a brief while
and his brain broadcast its reactions
nobody here nobody they fooled me
they made me hear things imagine
things then they turned the lock and
swung the door hypnos and teleports
together thats multitalented no mat-
ter what the experts may say the hell
devils his impulses suddenly boosted
to maximum amplitude run for it
you idiot run

  then the unexpected happened with
one hand on the door bolstered by the
certitude that armed search-parties
were somewhere in the emptiness be-
fore him thorstern lifted a foot for the
first swift step in his wild dash for
safety his whole body braced for the
effort he stood poised while a thorough-
ly bewildered expression came into his
face he put the foot down sank to his
knees like one prostrating himself be-
fore an unseen god his thought stream
had gone into a violent and unintelligi-
ble swirl that flung out odd words and
phrases

   no  oh no dont i cant i tell
you  let me alone    wasnt my
fault oh let me-

  he toppled forward writhed as if in
soundless pain already raven was
bending over him features tight and
serious obviously taken by surprise
charles had come hurriedly out of his
chair mavis appeared in the opposite
doorway her eyes condemning but her
lips saying nothing

  raven grabbed the stricken mans
right hand and immediately the bodily
contortions ceased lumbering round to
the other side charles helped carry the
	startling stories

lax body across the room and dump it in
a chair mavis closed the door but did
not bother to reset the lock frowning
to herself she went back to lier room

  in a little while thorstern gulped a
couple of times opened his eyes pushed
himself further into the chair there
were weird thrills running along his
nerves and a highly unpleasant sensa-
tion like effervescence in his blood
stream his limbs lacked strength and
his inside seemed turned to water his
face was colorless like wax

  glowering at raven he said in trem-
bling tones you squeezed my heart

  not guilty

  then it was you he turned his
head to glare at charles

  me neither the truth is that we
saved you-if you can call it salvation
charles smiled at a secret thought but
for us youd now be one of the late la-
mented

  do you expect me to believe that
one of you two did it

  how asked raven studying him
both outwardly and inwardly

  one of you is a teleport he unlocked
and opened the door without stirring
himself he squeezed my heart the same
way thats what you did to greatorex

  a teleport moves objects by exterior
influence raven contradicted he
cant reach inside people and rearrange
their plumbing its impossible

  i was nearly gone insisted thor-
stern i felt my heart being compres-
sed my body falling i felt that i was
being dragged out of it by main force
somebody did it

  not necessarily a million die with-
out assistance for every one that is
helped

  i cant die like that he made it
childishly complaining

  why not

  im fifty-eight and theres nothing
wrong with me gingerly he felt him-
self gauged the thumping inside his
chest nothing wrong

  so it seems said raven pointedly

  if i were fated to go naturally of a

heart attack it would be one heck of a
coincidence for me to drop at the very
moment im about to run out on you

  hed made a good point there he de-
cided pinned it on them effectively
but deep down inside thrust into an
obscure corner where he wouldnt have
to look at it-at least not too often-
was the unwelcome idea that perhaps
they were right maybe his time was
more limited by destiny than hed as-
sumed

  dragging it right into the light and
compelling him to look at it raven
said if you were so fated it would
most likely come at a moment of great
strain so wheres the coincidence be-
sides you didnt run you didnt die
next week you may do so or tomorrow
or before dawn no man knoweth the
day or the hour he pointed again at
the others midget chronometer mean-
while the five minutes have become
fifteen

  i give up finding a large handker-
chief thorstern wiped his forehead
his breathing was labored and he re-
mained sheet-white i give up

it was true more penetrating minds
could see it inside him a genuine
verity formed of a dozen hastily thought
up reasons some contradictory but all
satisfying

  cant run in top gear forever ease
down and live longer got to look after
myself why build for someone elses
benefit wollencotts twelve years
younger fancies hell be the big boss
after im gone thinks im going to
work and scheme and sweat for his
sake floreat venusia-under a stink-
ing mutant even terra does better
heraty and most of the council are
normals gilchrist assured me of that

  raven made a mental note gilchrist
a world councilor the traitor in the
camp and undoubtedly the character
who had betrayed him to the under-
ground headquarters on terra the
man whose name kayder and the others
didnt know because they did not want
the star

to know it

  if its not one mutant itll be
another thorsterns stream ran on
one of them will bide his time take
over my empii-e like taking milk from
a kitten i was safe enough while all
attention was on wollencott but now
theyve gone back of him and got at
me the mutants have powers some
day theyll organize themselves against
the common run of men  wouldnt care
to be here then

   his eyes lifted discovered the others
watching ive told you i give up what
more do you want

  nothing raven went toward the
wall phone like me to call an anti-
grav to take you home

   no ill walk i urant time to decide
the best way to cut various strings be-
sides i dont trust you

   he arose shakily felt his chest again
within him was suspicion of such ready
acceptance of surrender and such casual
release had they timed something to
happen at the other end of the road
well away from this house perhaps
another squeezing of the heart until he
was finished

  we trust you because of what shows
in your mind raven told him its
your hard luck that you cant see into
ours you wont be touched by us un-
less you renege

  going to the door thorstern opened
it looked them over for the last time
his face was still pallid and he seemed
to have aged somewhat but he had re-
covered a measure of dignity

   i have promised to put a stop to all
hostile action against terra he said
that and no more

  he stepped outside gave his parting
shot a touch of incongruity by care-
fully closing the door behind him fifty
years ago a tall bitter woman had boxed
his ears for slamming doors and all un-
realized by him the ears still tingled

   following the wralls he hurried along
the road at the best pace he could mus-
ter general obscurity made it slower
than he liked now and again he stopped

watchers	

to listen then hastened on at this un-
earthly hour there would be few people
about other than restless nocturnals and
roaming patrols he had gone an un-
known distance before he detected
sounds to his left

  cupping his hands he called are
you there

  coming

  they loomed out of the dark yellow
haze six of them heavily armed
whats the matter

  youre looking for a man named
david raven

  dead right we are know where he
is

  ive just left him hes-hes-
he found himself uncertain which
way to point in every direction was the
same accursed yellow cloud he could
not remember whether he had stopped
in his tracks the instant he heard the
patrol or whether he had turned to face
them maybe he had shifted around
still more while talking to them
hes-

  make up your mind mister

  i tell you ive just left him his
voice was loud with irritation

  what dyou mean by just how
long ago

  was it two minutes five ten or
twenty he squinted at his chronom-
eter but it told him nothing except the
correct time

  recently he said feeling savage
recently echoed the leader of the
patrol not bothering to hide his sar-
casm not far away he swept his
arm in an indiscriminate semicircle
somewhere around there

  listen mister interrupted the
other a dope came on the spectro-
screen and mentioned this raven in the
same breath as money weve been on
the beat since midnight and so far
have had forty-four nutheads offering
raven to us for half the take so were
fed up mister he gave thorstern a
gentle push youre out of bed too
late and dreaming things go home
and dont chivvy working men
	startling stories

thorstern demanded is there a
telepath among you

  nary a one said the leader seeing
no reason to give a detailed list of the
types in his patrol there are one and
a quarter million people and about
four hundred thousand houses in this
city listening outside every house
until someone says too much would
take a month even with an army of
telepaths there arent enough to go
around and if you ask me its just as
well ive no love for them

  neither have i agreed thorstern
with fevor he was reluctant to go
without devising some way of steering
the patrol to a point that he could not
now find theyd give raven and the fat
fellow a run for their money if only he
could get them there

  all right said the patrols spokes-
man if you want to stand there smell-
ing the smoke until dawn you do so
were going dont you worry about
raven well get him eventually but it
wont be by night itll be in broad day-
light when a man can see from here to
the sawtooths

  they vanished into the fog another
patrol was now coming toward thor-
stern from the hidden road on his right
for all he could tell they might all be
within spitting distance of his enemies
at that precise moment he knew it was
no use tackling them about the matter
no use whatever

  he had promised to cease his new
style guerilla war against terra and that
promise he would keep but it did not
cover individual terrans such as multi-
talented mutants with no scruples the
game was not ended and as he had re-
minded himself earlier tomorrow is an-
other day

xx

back in the room charles stopped
his careful listening hes muzzy
doesnt know which way to send them
so hes going home he crossed heavy
legs and patted his stomach when he

flopped in the doorway i thought for a
moment that youd taken him then i
picked up your yelp of surprise

  and i thought it was you raven
frowned to himself it caught me nap-
ping good job i got to him so quickly
or hed have been gone

  yes a heart-attack the moon eyes
became quizzical or was it

  somebody was indecently precipi-
tate said raven somebody had a one-
track mind and couldnt wait to be edu-
cated thats wrong very wrong
somebody held out a long time and
gave up slowly reminded charles as if
that explained everything so the
would-be emperor of venus was mighty
lucky if he had gone it would have been
relatively quickly oh well hes a hard
character with more than his share of
fortitude nothing else could have scared
him into reasonable pacifism

  im glad it ended that way if he had
expired wed have had more of this
messing around lots more wollencott
would have to be dealt with this sur-
render has saved a lot of extra grief
a surrender with mental reserva-
tions charles commented he couldnt
help stewing them while fumbling his
way along the road

  i heard him

  hes a sticker if nothing else first
he reserves the right to feed his promise
to the ducks if at any future time he can
discover a way to make himself abso-
lutely mutant-proof he estimates the
chance of that as a million to one
against but he insists on covering the
odd chance second he reserves the right
to slap you clean into the next galaxy
but cant imagine a satisfactory method
just yet

  thats not all contributed raven
im guessing hell get in direct touch
with the world council criticize wol-
lencott and the underground movement
deplore their deeds sympathize with
terra and offer to put a stop to the whole
business for a worth-while considera-
tion

  he might at that
the star

   let him its no business of ours the
 main purpose has been achieved and
 thats all that counts he mused a
 while before saying a large and rea-
 sonably efficient organization takes a
 deal of constructing especially when it
 includes belligerent sections operating
 outside the law its hard to knock down
 what one has built up with painstaking
 care

  and so

   thorstern wont like doing it hell
call off the hounds but hate to break up
the pack the only thing that would
soothe his soul would be to form a big-
ger and better pack theres one way he
 could do that namely with the knowl-
edge and approval of the most influential
of his recent opponents including
heraty

   for what purpose they dont know
of the denebs and therefore-

   i told thorstern that humanity will
fight its way out of humanitys fixes he
may remember that hes ignorant of
the denebs as youve just said but may
decide-and convince heraty and others
-that the hour of trial is already here
pawns versus mutants being what he
is thorstern thinks of human beings as
solely of his own kind while mutants
are not quite human or are quasi-
human	-

  ah charles narrowed his eyes
the intolerance exists today it
wouldnt need a lot of boosting

t aven shrugged who knows it bet-
ter than us anyway i cant see
how he can avoid thinking of it sooner
or later hes got brains and courage
and hes more than pigheaded

   it wouldnt be easy the mutant mi-
nority is an exceedingly small one but
plenty large enough to make extermina-
tion a major problem

   numerical ratios arent the whole of
it raven declared i can see two ob-
stacles both big

   such as which

  one they can wipe out only the
known paranormals how many more

watchers	

are unknown how many are beyond
identification by ordinary minds and in-
tend to remain that way

  that makes the job impossible to
complete offered charles thorstern
doesnt strike me as the kind who is will-
ing to do things by half measures per-
haps hell lay off when he realizes hes
got no choice

   maybe he will it remains to be seen
obstacle number two is the natural con-
sequence of coexistent civilizations on
three planets suppose thorstern tries
to persuade them to arrange simultane-
ous pogroms aimed to rid humanity of
its too-clever boys each planet immedi-
ately senses a trap if it slaughters its
own mutants while the other two do
not- the point gained added signi-
ficance by being left suspended

  mutual distrust charles nodded
knowingly a plump clown trying to look
profound and it could be worse than
that if two worlds ridded themselves of
their talent and the third did not boy
how soon could it gain complete mastery
of the others in such an event i could
give a shrewd guess at which would be
the third world and whod be bossing it
three worlds can see the same pic-
ture terrans and martians are neither
more nor less dopy than venusians so
whichever way thorstern turns hell
have a tough proposition on his hands
the trouble is hes the sort who likes
tough propositions i dont think weve
heard the last of him

  neither do i and david were at
the top of his list for summary remov-
al a chuckle sounded low down in his
belly if he can do it

  im going back thanks for the hos-
pitality crossing the room raven put
his head through the inner doorway and
said to mavis good-by delicious

  and good riddance nuisance she
gave him a false scowl that fooled him
not at all

  he pulled an atrocious face at her
went outside waved a careless hand at
charles youve been a pal see you in
the morgue

light over this mechanical menagerie
the night mist was still noticeable but
had thinned considerably as the huge
but invisible sun started to poke its rim
over the horizon in less than an hour
the fog would soar and leave the ground
clear

  the whole place was heavily but in-
efficiently guarded with little groups of
men lounging near the fuel tanks and re-
pair shops while others mooched singly
around the perimeter not one of them
was mentally alert

  raven appreciated this common state
of mind he had got to within a hun-
dred yards of the perimeter and was ex-
ercising caution undoubtedly these
guards had been warned to look out for
him and thorsterns surrender would
not have caused that warning to be with-
drawn

  most of these armed watchers were
ordinary men unconscious of power
wranglers on this world or any other a
few might be followers of thorstern
concealed in the shadow of wollencott
and these would have additional unoffi-
cial orders about what to do should
raven show up there was no way of
telling which was which because one and
all were thinking only of the end of their
spell of duty and the petty pleasures
soon to follow

  this fellow coming near had a vivid
imagination filled with a large plate of
bacon and eggs he also had two vir-
tues he was a roamer and a floater
raven had watched him for some time
found he was one of the few on an ir-

regular beat free to wander at will
around the grounded machines several
times he had strained a moment left the
surface and soared over some vessel that
he could not be bothered to walk around
the other guards all apparently earth-
bound had observed these occasional
floatings with casual disinterest

jplrawn by what he felt as a mere im-
u pulse the guard ambled around a
corner of the little toolshed behind which
raven was waiting on a similar im-
pulse coming from he knew not where
he held his chin at a convenient angle
he was most cooperative and raven
smacked the chin caught the body with
its bacon and eggs still whirling low-
ered it to ground

  wearing the others badged cap and
official slicker raven came from behind
the shed and sauntered onto the field
the victim was shorter than he and the
slicker came barely to his knees but
there was a good chance it would not be
noticed since there were no guards near-
er than two hundred yards trouble was
most likely to come from a telepath if
one made a pass at him and got a com-
plete blank hed know him immediately
as more than a mere floater then the
band would start to play with a ven-
geance

  bending his arm to hold the gun in its
crook exactly as the other had carried it
raven came to the passenger ship that
was waiting for mail it was the star
wraith one of the latest models fully
fueled and ready to blow there was no
one on board he tensed and soared over
it landing lightly the other side

  for all the diversity of craft around
his choice of an escape vehicle was lim-
ited the gyros copters and antigravs
were strictly localized contraptions
there was nothing but the star wraith
and the pair of courier boats either of
the latter would do providing they were
fueled

  the nearer courier boat had full tanks
and was all set but he passed it by to
look at the other that too lacked noth-
the star

ing but its pilot both vessels were with-
out personnel and neither was locked
he preferred the second because there
was quarter-mile clearance behind its
tail

  just then a mind behind the toolshed
returned from its involuntary vacation
forgot former visions of breakfast tried
to coordinate itself raven detected it at
once he had been expecting it waiting
for it the blow had been enough to
gain him a couple of minutes and he had
hoped that was all he would require

  what did i run into the foggy
mind mumbled confusedly a few sec-
onds then i got slugged a pause
followed by an agitated my cap my
gun some pup of a mangy tree-cat
has-

  with a deceitfully casual air raven
rose as if to float over the selected ship
instead he hit the lock twenty feet up
and got inside closing the circular door
he snapped its fasteners made his way
to the pilots seat and sat down

  somebody bopped me jeepers he
must have been ready it faded out for
a moment came back in increased
strength as the other bellowed both
mentally and vocally look out you
dreamers theres a guy up to some-
thing he pinched my-

  amid the resulting medley of thought
forms that shot from the subject of off
duty to on duty four stronger ones
emerged from nothingness felt blindly
around ship after ship they reached
the courier boat touched ravens men-
tal shield tried to spike through it re-
coiled

  who are you

  he did not reply the ship went dum-
dum-dum as its pumps and injectors
went into operation

  they were mentalities of a caliber
quite different from the host of others
milling around sharp precise direct-
able and knew an armor-plated mind
when they encountered it

  another tele wont talk got his
shield up hes in that courier 
better surround it

watchers	

  surround it not likely if he lets
go a blast hell incinerate this part of
the circle

  if its that fellow raven theres go-
ing to be some awful ructions because
were supposed to-

  i tell you we dont know who it is
  bet you its raven

  the radio dinged and the cause of all
the excitement flipped the switch a
hoarse voice from the main control tow-
er promptly burst forth with outraged
authority

  you in km open the lock

  he didnt respond to that either
things were still dum-dumming half-
way back to the tail the meters were
quivering and a red line on an ivory
strip had crept up to a point marked
ready

  you in km i warn you-

cmiling he glanced in the rear-view
periscope saw half a dozen armed
men fanned out a couple of hundred
yards behind his pipes his forefinger
scratched a button depressed it for a
fraction of a second something went
whop and the vessel gave a jump and a
neat ball of superheated vapor bulleted
backward the advancing six raced mad-
ly from the center of the target

  the stud went down a second time
and orange-white flames spouted from
the rear end the resulting roar was
terrific but inside it sounded as nothing
more than a high moan

  a million miles out raven set the
auto-pilot examined his rear-view
screens for evidence of pursuit there
were no signs of it the likelihood of be-
ing chased from venus was small be-
cause it would be futile ships capable
of catching the kind he was using had
yet to be built

  it was remotely possible but not prob-
able that some vessel already in the
void might be ordered to try to inter-
cept him the forward screens and de-
tectors showed nothing noteworthy
ahead except one pinpoint of infrared
radiation too far away to identify prob-

ably the fantome homeward-bound she
should be somewhere around that re-
gion

  content to let the auto-pilot do the
work raven sat a while in the tiny con-
trol cabin and surveyed the awesome
spread of the cosmos his air was that
of one who has seen it a thousand times
and hopes to see it ten thousand more

  nevertheless he left the sparkling
view lay in the tiny bunk and closed his
eyes but not to sleep he shut his eyes
the better to open his mind and listen
as he had never done to the secret
thoughts of ordinary men the vessels
steady purring did not distract him in
the slightest neither did the rare psst
and momentary flare of colliding parti-
cles of cosmic dust

  they could just be heard if one over-
came ones fleshly muffling by straining
hard enough and concentrating suffi-
ciently eerie mental voices vibrating
through the endless dark many of these
impulses lacked amplitude had flattened
wave forms and had become greatly at-
tenuated by travel through illimitable
distances others were stronger because
relatively nearer but still far far away

were doing that landing on some
worlds departing from others ignoring
a good many more sometimes attracted
toward one sometimes turned away

these faraway entities according to the
unknown rules of an unknown game

  by and large the denebs seemed to
discard most worlds either at first sight
or after a short stay yet still they kept
on searching poking probing through
an enormous area that was still widen-
ing if one thing could be positively de-
termined about them it was that they
were incurable fidgets

  raven spent all his time either listen-
ing to this talk from the great deeps of
infinity or gazing at the unending con-
course of stars through the fore ob-

stern wollencott and the rest had been
put aside their ambitions and rivalries

al pair of six-seater police boats
jumped off the moon and tried to fol-
low the courier on its way in they
were out of luck it plunged at terra as
if it had fifty light-years yet to go shot
sidewise when far ahead of the pursuit
vanished over the planets eastward
limb by the time the others curved
round to that hemisphere the boat had
landed and become lost in more scenery
than twelve pairs of eyes could scruti-
nize

watchers	

  it lay on a rocky moor where another
takeoff would damage nobodys prop-
erty raven stood by its tail and watched
the sky a while but the police boats did
not appear above the horizon probably
they were zooming disconsolately three
or four hundred miles to the east or
west

  crossing thick heather he reached a
dirt road went to the farmhouse he had
observed while coming down he used
the phone to call an antigrav cab which
came in a short time from a near-by
village within the hour he was at ter-
ran intelligence headquarters

  as long-faced and lugubrious as ever
carson signed to a seat put his hands
together as if about to pray

  youre a prime headache youve
given me more work to do in a week
than usually i get in a month

  how about the work you gave me
that wasnt so tough by the looks of
it you walked out of here and youve
walked back in between times youve
annoyed important people and scared
the wits out of others you have
thumbed your nose at every existing
law and now ive got to cover you up
somehow heaven alone knows how
what id like to know is this are
you covering me up a moon patrol
came after me on the way in despite my
being in a courier boat

  a stolen one carson nodded ag-
grievedly at a bunch of papers on his
desk im on that right now youll be
whitewashed dont worry where have
you planted the boat

  raven told him adding id have
brought it straight into the spaceport
but for those cops trying to sit on my
neck their chase made it look as if i
was wanted and of late ive been want-
ed quite enough to do me for a time

  ill have a pilot pick it up and bring
it in he poked the papers away from
him woe woe all i get is woe
running from venus to here takes
quite a while even in a courier boat
raven pointed out so ive lost touch
whats happened
	stabtlinu stories

arson said last week we killed
two characters who were trying to
bring down an important bridge both
proved to be mars-born next day a
power station went sky high on satur-
day we found on ingenious contraption
planted at the foot of a dam and
snatched it away in the nick of time

  on the other hand carson went on
scientists now report that the dexter
blowup almost certainly was a genuine
accident they said the fuel proved to
be unstable in certain exceptional and
unforeseen conditions they claim to
have found a cure already he made a
gesture of impatience its once in a
blue moon i get an authoritative report
like that and until i do were compelled
to treat every major accident as some-
thing deliberate cant even get rid of
suspects weie still holding eight sus-
pects taken from that underground
dump mars or venus-born skewboys
every one of them if i had my way id
deport them but it cant be done
theyre legally terrans see

  yes thats the trouble raven
leaned forward mean to tell me that
the wars still going oa

  cant say for certain it was contin-
uing up to the end of last week maybe
its now over he surveyed the other
speculatively day before yesterday
heraty came in to say our worries are
ended there have been no reports of
any further incidents since

  youve heard nothing about a man
named thorstern 

  i have for a long time weve had
operatives hanging around wollencott
eventually two of them sent in reports
saying that one thorstern was the real
driving force behind the movement but
they werent able to dig up convincing
evidence in support

  that all

  no carson admitted it with reluc-
tance not wanting to keep on the sub-
ject heraty said that thorstern is
dickering with him

  is that so did he give any details
  he doubted thorstems good faith

or for that matter that he really was
what he claimed to be namely the man
who could call a halt to venusian in-
transigence thorstern offered to prove
it

  how

  said hed remove wollencott for
no obvious reason carson voiced a loud
sigh finished that was the day before
yesterday this morning we received a
message from venus saying that wol-
lencott had just fallen out of an antigrav
and bounced too hard for his health
umph raven could visualize the
wallop almost hear the crunch of bones
nice way to dismiss a faithful servant
isnt it

  better not say that openly its libel-
ous

  i can traduce one or two more world
councilor gilchrist for example hes
your suspected fly in the ointment
thorstern said so himself without real-
izing it a memory came back and he
took it up dont know what gilchrist
looks like but i sniffed around the coun-
cils minds during that interview and i
didnt smell a rat how was that

  he wasnt there carson scribbled a
brief note on a slip of paper four
members were absent because of sick-
ness or urgent business gilchrist turned
up a minute after you left

  his urgent business was to put a hur-
ried finger on me raven stated what
are you going to do about him

  nothing i can do merely on your
say-so ill pass this info to heraty and
the rest is up to the council

  youre right of course its of no
consequence if they do nothing or even if
they award him a medal for being sly
basically few things are of real conse-
quence he stood up went to the door
paused with a hand on the panel
theres one item with fair claim to a
little weight in so far as anything is
weighty thorstern is a normal so is
heraty you and i are not

what of it asked carson uneasily
there are men whose nature wont
let a defeat go unavenged there are
the star

men hard enough to sit in an antigrav
and watch a loyal supporter dive to de-
struction there are men who can be-
come very frightened if properly stimu-
lated that is the great curse of this
world fear he stared hard at the
other pupils wide irises shining
know what makes men sorely afraid 
death ventured carson in sepul-
chral tones

  other men raven contradicted
remember that especially when hera-
ty tells you only a little and carefully
omits to give you the rest

  the other did not inquire what he
meant he sat silent watched raven go
out watched the door close behind him
heraty he thought was a man to watch
carefully

   a tawdry little office up four flights of
worn and dirty stairs was the haunt of
samuel glaustraub a rudimentary hyp-
no barely able to fascinate a sparrow
somewhere back in his ancestry there
had been one mutant whose talent had
skipped a few generations and reap-
peared greatly weakened from other
forebears he had inherited a legalistic
mind and wagging tongue which fea-
tures he valued far more than the tricks
of any skewboy

fntering this office raven propped
-- himself against its short ink-
stained counter and said morning
sam

  sam looked up dark eyes querulous
behind horn-rimmed glasses should i
know you

  not at all

  the other frowned he said what
can i do for you

  youve a client named arthur kay-
der

  yes his case will be heard tomor-
row he shook a sorrowful head i
shall defend him to the best of my ability
but it will be rather hopeless he gave
raven an apologetic scrutiny youre
a friend of his i presume

  his best enemy so far as i know he
may have better ones elsewhere

watchers	

  ha-ha approved glaustraub his
belly quivering you are joking of
course

  wrong first time sammy im the
boy he yearns to strip down to a skele-
ton

  eh his jaw dropped your name
david raven

  correct

tt unnerved glaustraub he took
off his glasses tapped them worried-
ly put them on and went around looking
for them

  theyre on your nose raven in-
formed him youre all of a flutter
anything wrong

  i am taken by surprise he decided
to stand it is most unusual to find the
leading witness against one of my cli-
ents-

  who said i was a witness against
him

  that is what ive assumed since it
is obvious that you have returned in
time to appear on behalf of the prose-
cution i-

  supposing i dont appear what
does the prosecution do then 
proceeds just the same the record-
ed evidence is deemed sufficient to secure
conviction

  yes but thats only because my testi-
mony in support can reasonably be
taken for granted what if i say i knew
kayder was kidding

  mr raven you mean- glau-
straubs hands started trembling you
really think that

  like heck i do

  then why-why-

  he stared around in a state of hope-
less confusion

  id rather kill a man outright than
let him waste years in clink besides if
the positions were reversed kayder
wouldnt do as much for me

  glaustraub spent most of a minute
trying to follow the logic of that remark
giving it up with the vague feeling that
hed been outsmarted somewhere or
other he asked are you willing to ap-
	startling stories

pear as witness for the defense

  not if theres an easier way out
you could swear an affidavit he
suggested filled with a curious mixture
of doubt suspicion and hope

  thatll do me samuel where do i
swear it

  glaustraub grabbed a hat slammed it
on back to front he shoved past the
counter opened the door come with
me if you please

  taking his caller at a sedate gallop
down two flights glaustraub ushered
him into another office occupied by four
men all overweight with their aid he
concocted a document which raven read
carefully and signed

  there you are sam

  this is generous of you mr raven
his hands loved the affidavit his eyes
gleamed his mind pictured the coming
master stroke when glaustraub for the
defense arose amid breathless silence
and in calm confident well modulated
tones proceeded to snitch the prosecu-
tions breeches there would be oppor-
tunity for drama such as hed never en-
joyed before and he looked forward to
exploiting it to the full glaustraub for
once was supremely happy exceeding-
ly generous if i may say so my client
will appreciate it

  thats the idea said raven when
a bunch of bums comes after ones scalp
theres nothing like a little gratitude for
sowing discord in the ranks

when raven approached the house
all was quiet and peaceful leina was
within your woman thorstern had
called her making it sound reprehen-
sible he had been right in suggesting
that their association did not conform to
the customs of humanity utterly wrong
in implying that there was anything im-
moral about it

  pausing by the gate raven examined
a crater in the field outside the hole
was big enough to swallow an antigrav
cab apart from this queer feature the

house and its surroundings were exactly
as he had left them

  he went to the front door turned its
lock teleportatively in the same way
that charles had opened the castle gate
it swung wide leina was waiting in the
lounge big hands folded in her generous
lap her eyes showing gladness

  im a bit late he did not offer any
warmer greeting neither did he kiss
her the warmth was felt without need
of expression while in the present pe-
culiar circumstances a kiss would have
been futile he had never kissed never
wanted to never been expected to i
stopped to take the bite off kayder
tilings have changed

  things never change she observed
the little things have changed i am
not referring to the big ones

  the big ones are all-important
youre right bright eyes but i dont
agree with what you imply namely that
the little things are unimportant un-
der her steady mildly accusing gaze he
found it needful to justify himself we
dont want them to fall foul of the den-
ebs neither do we want them to de-
stroy themselves

  the latter would be regrettable but
not dangerous the denebs would learn
nothing

theyll never be any wiser as it is
that may be she conceded but
you have sown a few seeds of knowledge
sooner or later you will be forced to up-
root them

  womanly intuition eh he grinned
like a mischievous boy mavis felt the
same way about it

  with reason

  when the time arrives the seeds can
be obliterated every single one of them
you know that dont you

  of course youll be ready and ill be
ready where you go i shall go her
brilliant optics were unblinking yet i
still think your interference was unnec-
essary and extremely risky

  risks have to be taken sometimes
would you rather have let them go to
unforeseeable lengths perhaps to com-
the star

plete extermination

  for one thing she said undis-
turbed i doubt whether theyd go that
far no matter how unlimited their folly
for another if they did it would be the
lesser of two evils

  where possible i prefer to have it
both ways the war is off in theory
humanity is now able to concentrate on
getting farther out

  why do you say in theory

his face sobered theres a slight
chance that theyll let the opportu-
nity go by in favor of having another
and different conflict

  i see going to the window she
stcod with her back toward him and
looked out over the landscape david
in that event will you again insist on
taking part

  no such a war would be against
our kind and those thought to be of our
kind so i wont be given the opportuni-
ty to chip in ill be smacked down with-
out warning if they can do it he came
and stood beside her they may deal
with you in the same way do you
mind

  not in the least so long as every-
thing remains covered

  it mightnt happen anyway his
gaze followed hers and abruptly he
changed the subject when are you
buying the ducks

  ducks

  he indicated the crater for that
pond youve had started over there
without waiting for a reply he insisted
what happened

  i came back from town last friday
afternoon made to open the door sensed
something inside the lock

  what was it

  a tiny sphere like a blue bead with a
white spot on it i could see it with my
mind it was positioned so that a key
would press on the spot so i ported it
out laid it over there and let a pebble
drop on the white mark the house
shook

  some mini-engineer took a big

chance he commented even the tele-
port who placed it had to risk a momen-
tary distraction once more his strange
callousness revealed itself as he said if
the trick had worked as intended no-
body would have been more surprised
than you

  one person she corrected you
the night was exceptionally clear the
stars bright and beckoning lying in a
tilted-back chair under the roofs glass
dome raven closed his eyes and listened
beside him in a similar chair leina did
the same these were their nights in
the chairs beneath the dome looking and
listening there were no bedrooms in
the house no beds they did not need
them just the chairs and the dome

  on terra and beyond terra some-
thing always was happening nor did
incidents come twice the same this was
the work of the eternal watcher a re-
sponsible job and highly essential
others shared it elsewhere charles and
mavis on venus horst and karin on
mars and more

  his mind turning to this last couple
he watched the pink light hanging low
in the sky and called horst horst

  it came after a long while weakened
by terras atmospheric blanket yes
david

  know what your insurgents are do-
ing

  mostly arguing with each other
david theyve split into several groups
the largest group is disgusted with
everything and about to break up

  so theyre going through a period of
chronic indecision

  thats about it

  thanks horst

  he redirected his mind charles
charles

here let you know what i discover
do that youve heard about wollen-
cott

  i have nasty business

  clumsy charles agreed he might
have landed in some soft place and suf-
fered injuries that meant slow dying as
it happened he didnt but it was sheer
luck his mental beam cut off a mo-
ment came back here the organiza-
tion seems to be reluctantly falling to
pieces but its potential will remain and
it can be rebuilt anytime i cant help
wondering

  and i know why

  why

  mavis keeps reminding you youve
blundered

  true said charles and i know
why youve guessed it

  why

  leina keeps telling you the same
correct raven admitted weve
agreed not to agree

  same here youd think i was a ju-
venile delinquent the way she looks at
me the main issue will be protected no
matter what happens so why do the
women get the heebies

  because they look at these worlds
from a feminine viewpoint and its a ma-
ternal one you and i have been throw-
ing the baby too high it makes them
nervous to watch us

  probably youre right but how do
you know all this how many babies-
i use ray imagination interrupted
raven  by charles

a ll he got back was a telepathic
grunt he glanced at leina she
was lying back her eyes closed her face
to the stars for a little while he studied
her and was not looking at the surface
features visible to ordinary men the
face was no more than a fleshy mask be-
hind which he could see the real leina

  she was quite unconscious of his scru-
tiny for her mind was tuned elsewhere
and absorbing the never-ending chatter
of the heavens soon he followed her ex-
ample listened to messages dimmed by

terran atmosphere but still discernible

  scouting warily around bluefire a
condensing giant twenty black ships of
destroyer type

       repeatedly but complete lack of
common ground makes it impossible to
communicate with these flutterers
cant even make them sense that were
trying to speak to them much less warn
them if the denebs arrive and become
hostile toward them well have to take
appropriate action and-

  im calling from thais got in right
away without arousing the least suspi-
cion struck lucky with one who had
superswift coordination and said yes
by all means 

     poor savages have chosen us for
their annual sacrifice to the twin suns
it wont be long now somebody else had
better make ready to take over in our
place

  that last message bit into ravens be-
ing he stirred sat up felt restless the
stars blazed down but the void around
them was deep and dark bitterly dark

over the following three weeks
raven kept close watch on world news
given over the radio and spectroscreen
networks it was boringly uneventful
but he stuck to the task in the dogged
manner of one who waits for something
that must not be missed although it may
never come

  no mention of erstwhile anti-terran
activities came over the air this was
not remarkable there had been no hint
of anything of the sort even when they
were at their height privately willing
to concede the existence of a war ter-
ras powers-that-be refused to admit the
fact in public

  neither was anything said about de-
velopment of space-ships or the pros-
pects of plunging farther into unknown

in the public interest

  at the end of the third week the fully-
colored three-dimensional spectroscreen
stax-ted a new serial of four parts just
another of a regular series of so-called
thrillers it featured a telepathic hero
who had looked repeatedly into the non-
mutant heroines mind and found it pure
and sweet and clean the villain was de-
picted as a low-browed lower-minded
insectivocal with a lopsided sneer and a
penchant for the sinister fondling of
centipedes

  it was trash of the kind designed to
occupy minds that otherwise might find
time to think nevertheless raven
watched the whole performance with the
avidity of an incurable addict when the
end came the villain had been foiled
virtue had triumphed amid soft lights
and falling rose petals and a symbolic
boot had crushed a symbolic centipede
he sighed like one satiated then went
to see kayder

  the man who answered his ring was a
pawn resembling a broken-down pugi-
list he had a bent nose ragged ears and
was wearing a gray sweater

  kayder in

  dont know ill see his small
sunken eyes measured the caller care-
fully wholl i say

  david raven

  it meant nothing to him he sham-
bled down the passage his mind recit-
ing the name as though it would slip
away if he didnt keep a half lock on it
presently he returned

  says hell see you

  legs bowed and arms swinging level
with his knees he conducted raven to
the back of the house announced in a
hoarse voice mr raven and lum-
bered away

it was the same room as before same
ornaments same desk but the boxes
had gone kayder stood up as he en-
tered tried to decide whether or not to
offer his hand finally contented himself
with indicating a chair

watchers	

  raven sat stretched his legs out
smiled at him so sammy did it he
had his little hour

  the case was dismissed on payment
of costs kayder told him it set me
back a hundred credits but was cheap at
the price his face quirked as he added
the old buffoon on the bench saw fit to
warn me that even evidence like yours
wouldnt save me if i abused the com-
munication channels a second time

  probably sammy annoyed him by
overdoing the drama raven ventured
anyway alls well that ends well

  it is kayder leaned forward eyed
him expectantly and now youve come
to collect

  an astute assumption rather crudely
expressed said raven let us say that
ive come to put the squeeze on you

  pulling open a drawer kayder looked
resigned how much

  how much what

  money

  money raven eyed the ceiling his
expression pained he talks about
money

  kayder slammed the drawer shut
look i want to know something why
did you get me in bad one minute and
lug me out the next

  they were diffeient minutes

  were they in what way

  in the first there was a conflict and
you were a menace safer out of the way
in the second the trouble had ceased or
was about to ceae and the need to pin
you down had vanished

  so you know the war is off

  of course havent you had orders
to that effect

  yes said kayder sourly and i
dont like it the entire movement is
going rapidly to pot

  which is all to the good you were
fighting for self-government-if the se-
cret dictatorship of one man can be
called self-government

wollencott was a natural born leader
but he hadnt the guts to be a dictator
he didnt need to have them said
raven the intestinal items were sun-
	startling stories

plied by thorstern

  kayder raised a surprised eyebrow
why drag thorstern into this

  you know of him

every venusian knows of him hes
one of the planets seven biggest men
hes the biggest raven corrected
so big in fact that he thinks venus
ought to be his personal property he
owned wollencott body and soul until
he gave him his freedom recently
gave him his freedom you mean-
we can put two and two together
cant we

  his mind stimulated into furious
thought kayder sat erect and let his fin-
gers tap on his desk

  after a while he growled it could
be ive never met thorstern in person
few have if it comes to that but hes
generally thought of as a hard and am-
bitious character if wollencott was
picking up steam from someone else
thorstern is the likeliest source he
frowned again i never suspected him
he kept himself well concealed

  he did

  thorstern ye gods he gazed
levelly at the other then why did he
get rid of wollencott

  he was persuaded to give up his
systematic bleeding of terra and confine
himself to more legitimate activities so
wollencott a former asset promptly
became an embarrassing liability thor-
stern has a way of dealing with liabili-
ties

  i hate to believe all this remarked
kayder with some resentment but
ive got to i know wollencott is dead
i know the movement is falling apart it
all adds up

  your mind says more raven point-
ed out it says the anti-terran move-
ment has divided into splinter groups
and you fear that some may try to curry
favor with the powers-that-be by ratting
on the others you think there are now
too many people who know too much
ill take my chance along with the
rest said kayder grimly ive less on
my conscience than some

  is a hypno named steen on your con-
science

  steen he rocked back i was
after him at the same time i was chasing
you i never got him

  he died very slowly

  so did haller kayder shot back
with sudden vim

  wrong on two counts haller went
more or less of his own volition above
all he went quickly

  whats the difference ones as dead
as the other

   the difference is not in their ultimate
condition said raven seriously and
with emphasis but in the speed of their
transition to it once upon a time you
evinced a nasty desire to reduce me to
my framework had you done it with
praiseworthy swiftness i could have
passed it off with a light laugh he gave
a light laugh by way of illustration
but if you had prolonged the process
unjustifiably i would have resented it

ayders eyes popped and he ex-
claimed thats about the craziest
piece of talk ive ever heard

  raven said its a crazy trinity of
worlds were in

  i know that but-

  besides he continued ignoring the
interruption youve not yet heard the
half of it i didnt come round merely
to pay a social call and indulge an hours
idle chatter i did you a favor now i
want you to do one for me

  here it comes kayder regarded
him with undisguised suspicion whats
the favor

  i want you to kill thorstern should
the necessity arise

  aha you do look you saved me
something though i dont know what
the maximum was seven years in clink
but i might have got away with six
months lets say you saved me six
months upward do you think thats
worth a murder

  youve overlooked my qualifying
words namely should the necessity
arise if it does arise it wont be mur-
the star watchers	

der itll be summary execution
whos goiner to say when the time has
come asked kayder looking shrewd
you

  in that case ill never reach a deci-
sion

  dont recall you being so finicky a
few weeks ago

  ive had enough im going to carry
on with my trading business and behave
myself providing other folk leave me
alone id be glad to do you a favor but
you ask too much

  im asking very little

  too much kayder repeated why
dont you do your own dirty work

  a fair question raven conceded
there are two excellent reasons
yes

  for one ive already drawn too much
attention to myself and am anxious not
to attract more for another if the
need to remove thorstern arises theres
every likelihood that the first sign of it
will be my own departure from this vale
of tears

 you mean-

  ill be dead

  kayder said you know whats in my
mind im indebted to you enough so
that when youre dead i wont be espe-
cially glad but its no use pretending
ill be sorry either

  youll be sorry

  care to tell me why

  because it may mean youre next
  next for what

  being wiped out of this world
standing up kayder spread hands
on his desk and spoke harshly youre
getting at something whos going to
wipe me out why should i be on the
same list as you

  waving him down and waiting for
him to compose himself raven an-
swered from the viewpoint of the
masses we share one thing in common-
neither of us is a normal

  what of it

  people generally are leery of para-
normals it cant be said that they love
them

  im not love-starved im used to
their attitude kayder gave a careless
shrug its a form of envy of those bet-
ter endowed by nature

  its also an instinctive wariness ap-
proaching fear its a natural and in-
eradicable part of their defense mecha-
nism some remarkable things can be
done with fear if you can arouse it to
sufficient intensity control it and direct
it

  kayder considered it a while and gave
his conclusions i cant read another
mans mind but that doesnt mean im
dopy i can see where youre going
you think thorstern may try to regain
power of a different but equally satis-
factory kind by stirring up an anti-
mutant crusade

  he might he used the aptitudes of
mutants such as yourself to further his
schemes now the way he looks at it
the same or similar aptitudes thwarted
him denied him victory even menaced
his life being himself a normal he prob-
ably thinks that he could gain fresh
ascendancy over his fellows only if all
of them were normals too there would
be endless scope for his abilities in a
civilization devoid of mutants

  all this is sheer speculation kayder
objected

tvodding agreement raven said
 just that and no more nothing
may happen thorsterns drive may go
in quite innocuous directions if so
there will be no need to take action
against him

  hed be playing a mighty dangerous
game if he tried it mutants may be
few in number but once united by a
common peril from the hordes of-
youre thinking along my original
lines raven interrupted ive switched
from them since thornstern is fifty-
eight these days people live to a hun-
dred and retain their faculties into the
late nineties so barring accidents or
assassination hes got a good while to
go

  what difference does that make
	startling stories

  he can afford to be patient and take
a longer way round to achieve the same
results by less arduous means

  kayder blinked and suggested make
it a bit clearer

  way back in the past raven ex-
plained some wiseacre remarked that
the most effective technique is not to
fight a thing but to set its own parts
fighting one another

   it registered like a shock

  change your way of thinking
raven went on go from the general
to the particular theres no such crea-
ture as a standardized mutant the
word is nothing more than the collec-
tive name for a biped menagerie he
watched the other as he added and
being what you are ill bet you consider
insectivocals to be the cream of the
crop

  an equivalent notion is nursed by
telepaths observed kayder pointedly

  thats a jab at me but no matter
each variety of mutant thinks itself
superior to the others each is as sus-
picious and jealous as any mere pawn
such a state of mind can be exploited
mutants are humans with all the faults
and follies of humans brother thor-
stern being an instinctively good psy-
chologist wont overlook that fact

  by now kayders mind had read-
justed he could see the possibilities
and was compelled to acknowledge their
existence the picture was anything but
a rosy one

  if he tries this out how dyou think
hell start

  systematically said raven first
of all hell gain the secret support of
heraty the world council and influen-
tial normals on three planets his next
step will be to correlate all data on mu-
tants that can be assembled from every
available source analyze it reach a posi-
tive decision as to which two types exer-
cise the most destructive powers and
therefore are the most dangerous then
hell choose one of those types to play
the part of ye goodde and faythfulle
knight the other for the role of baby-

eating dragon its simple

 and-

  lets say he decides the most effec-
tive play is to persuade the pyrotics to
exterminate the insectivocals forthwith
the propaganda services of three worlds
start mentioning insectivocals in a most
casual way but in an unflattering con-
text this continues building up preju-
dice against them showing them in an
increasingly unfavorable light until
eventually most humans-by which i
mean normals and other-type mutants
alike-subconsciously think of insecti-
vocals as prize stinkers with no competi-
tion

  hell in a mist rasped kayder

  that much having been achieved
along comes insidious suggestions that
insectivocals hate pyrotics because of
the latters bug-killing powers from
time to time there are gentle hints that
its a good thing we have pyrotics
around to take care of us

  like heck it is

  at the proper moment-and dont
forget that correct timing is all-impor-
tant-a well advertised official speech is
made in defense of insectivocals appeal-
ing for unity and tolerance and authori-
tatively denying an absurd rumor that
educated bugs plan to take over the
planet trinity with the aid of treacher-
ous insectivocals that does a lot of
good it makes the public again includ-
ing other-type mutants think theres no
smoke without fire

  they wont swallow all that guff
protested kayder inwardly knowing
that they might

  the public will swallow anything
providing it appears to bear the seal
of official approval and is sufficiently
long sustained and plays upon their
fears retorted raven he continued
imagine theyre now thoroughly
aroused what comes after

  you tell me

  something to trigger the situation
thus created he sought for an exam-
ple a skeleton is purposefully found
on its face in the sawtooths and gets a
the star watchers	

hundred times more publicity than it
deserves an inspired rumor flies around
that an innocent pyrotic has been
stripped down by an insectivocal fur-
ther emotion-arousing fairytales follow
right afterward a picked rabble rouser
gets a mob on the run when by a most
remarkable coincidence the police are
busy elsewhere before you know it you
and every other identifiable insectivocal
will be racing for dear life with a howl-
ing pack of normals after you other-
type mutants in the lead and pyrotics
panting to get at you first

comprehension spread slowly
over kayders face while thor-
stern sits back and smiles  he asked

  youve got the idea chum with the
aid of scared humanity he roots out the
last findable insectivocal and makes the
type extinct then follows a carefully
calculated period of peace and tran-
quillity before the propaganda services
start their new buildup on the next vic-
tims mini-engineers for example
hell never do it declared kayder
maybe not maybe yes did you see
that last serial on the spectroscreen
no

  you missed something it featured
mutants the hero was a telepath and
the extremely obnoxious villain was an
insectivocal

  hell never do it repeated kayder
in louder tones a pulse was beating in
his forehead ill kill him first
thats all i ask i came to you be-
cause you owe me a favor also because
recently you were the boss of a collection
of talent and probably can call on it
again leave thorstern alone to live
in peace but watch to see which way
hes going if you can see that for the
second time hes going to create human
disunity-

  he wont live long enough to do it
kayder promised and ill be doing you
no favor ill be protecting myself he
eyed raven calculatingly just as a
guess ill say youll need protecting long
before i do what plan have you 

  raven stood up and said none
none kayders eyebrows arched in
surpise why not

  perhaps unlike you im unable to
take action with regard to myself or
perhaps i want to be a martyr

xxv

back at the house raven sprawled
in a pneumaseat and said to leina
theres going to be more interference
if events make it desirable but not by
our kind human schemes will be coun-
tered by humans are you happy about
that

  id have liked it better if that had
been arranged in the first place she
gave back a little tartly

  the unfortunate thing was that it
couldnt be arranged the circumstances
were not the same as now terra couldnt
defend herself effectively without hurt-
ing herself by knocking the heads off her
own children besides she needs venus-
ian fuels and non-ferrous metals she
must have the martian jumping-off posts
of phobos and deimos to get further into
space

  how far they get is of no conse-
quence of no importance whatever
theyre entitled to their tiny frag-
ment of destiny arent they he threw
her a quizzical look

  she breathed a sigh of resignation
the trouble with males is that they
never grow up they remain hopeless
romantics her great eyes were pene-
trating as they rested upon him you
know perfectly well that these puny
bipeds are entitled to nothing but pres-
ervation from destruction at the hands
of the denebs

  have it your own way said raven
giving up the argument there was no
point in pursuing it with her she was
too utterly right

  furthermore she went on i have
been listening while you were busy with
less weighty affairs twelve black ships
have been reported in the region of
vega
bo	startling stokies

   he stiffened said vega thats the
nearest theyve come so far

  they may come nearer they may
arrive here in the end or they may
shoot off in some other direction and not
be seen in this cosmic sector for ten
thousand years all  can tell you is that
at present theyre closer than theyve
ever been she did not add more but
he knew what she was leaving unsaid
namely this is a bad time to take fool-
ish risks

   an error in tactics doesnt matter
where there is power to conceal it and
recover he pointed out i think ill go
catch up on the news

t tpstairs he reclined and opened his
mind and sought to extract from
the general babble that portion emanat-
ing from the region of vega it was not
easy too many talking at once

   the tripedal hoppers of raemis fled
into the damp marshlands and are fear-
fully declining all contact with the
denebs the latter appear to think the
world unsuitable for any purpose they
are making ready to depart

       twisted the pilots minds and
turned the entire convoy toward zebu-
lam a near-nova in sector fifty-one of
the chasm theyre still bulleting along
under the delusion that theyre on cor-
rect course

   they got the fright of their lives
when this cruiser came out of the dark
and fastened tractor beams upon them
it didnt take the denebs one-thousandth
of a time unit to realize that the ship
theyd caught was a crude contraption
designed by comparative savages they
let it go unharmed

       twelve in fan formation still
heading toward vega blue-white in sec-
tor one-ninety-one edge of the long
spray

  raven sat up and gazed at the sky
the long spray gleamed across the
zenith like a gauzy veil terrans called
it the milky way between here and
one significant gleam in the dark were a
thousand worlds to divert the attention

of oncoming ships but they might per-
sist on course ignoring other attrac-
tions when left alone to go their own
sweet ways the denebs were unpre-
dictable

  the end foreseen by leina arrived
after another three weeks during that
time neither radio nor spectroscreen
made mention of recent interplanetary
animosities while their other offerings
revealed no identifiable trend in any spe-
cial direction

   elsewhere twelve long black ships of
space had nosed a quarter turn to star-
board and now were approaching the
eight planets of a minor binary system
temporarily at least the drive toward
vega was arrested

  altogether this day could not have
been more peaceful uneventful without
promise of anything to disturb its tran-
quillity the morning sun shone down
bright and warm the sky was a clear
blue bowl marred only by a streak of
cloud low on the eastward horizon and
a great curving vapor-trail rising into
the stratosphere once more the fan-
tome was venus-bound

   a four-seater copter was the first indi-
cation that errors must be paid for that
the past has an unpleasant way of catch-
ing up with the present it droned out of
the west landed near the crater which
already was producing a crop of colorful
weeds

  getting out its only occupant exam-
ined the hole in the ground scuffed some
dirt near its edge gave up the problem
of what had caused it and went to the
house leina admitted him

  a young well-built type with frank
eager features he was a very junior op-
erative of terran intelligence a sub-
telepath able to probe minds but without
a shield for his own from the viewpoint
of those who had sent him he was an
excellent choice for his especial mission
essentially he was open and disarming

  my name is grant he introduced
himself conditioned by his own status
he spoke vocally ive come to tell you
that major lomax of terran intelli-
the star watchers	

gence would like to see you as soon as
convenient

  is it urgent raven asked

  i think so sir he instructed me to
bring you and this lady in the copter if
you were ready to leave at once if not
i am to make an appointment at a time
suitable to yourselves

  oh so he wants both of us do you
know what it is about

  im afraid not sir grants expres-
sion was candid and his unprotected
mind confirmed his words so far as he
was concerned this was a routine chore
of taking a couple of people to an inter-
view with his superior

  couldnt the major have come here
with you

  grant became slightly embarrassed
possibly sir i dont know why he
didnt there must be a reason it is
not for me to question-

  never mind we understand your
position raven gave leina an inquir-
ing glance might as well get it over
now what do you say 

  im ready her voice was low her
eyes brilliant as she studied the visitor

tjis face flushing grant fidgeted and
prayed for some means of closing
his mind which insisted on thinking
she is looking into me right inside of
me right at where im hiding inside
myself i wish she couldnt do that or
i wish i could look at her the same way
she is big and cumbersome-but very
beautiful

  leina smiled but made no remark not
wanting to add to his manifest discom-
fort by showing that his thoughts had
been read she shifted her attention

  ill get my coat and handbag david
then we can go

  when she reappeared they went to the
waiting machine which rose smoothly
under whirling vanes and drifted west-
ward nobody said anything during the
hours flight grant kept strictly to busi-
ness handled the controls maintained
his thoughts in polite and disciplined
channels leina studied the bright land-

scape below giving it the undivided at-
tention of one who is seeing it for the
first time-or the last raven closed his
eyes and attuned himself to calls far
above the normal telepathic band
david david

  yes charles

  they are taking us away

  we too charles

  the copter lost altitude floated down
toward a stark and lonely building upon
a windswept moor it was a squat heav-
ily built edifice resembling an abandoned
power station or perhaps a one-time
explosives dump

  touching earth the machine jounced
a couple of times settled itself grant
got out self-consciously helped leina
down with the others following he
went to the armor-plate front door
pressed a button set in thick concrete at
its side a tiny trap in the armor plate
opened like an iris diaphragm revealed
a scanner peering at them glassily

  apparently satisfied the trap closed
over the eye from behind the door came
a faint smooth whir of machinery as
huge bolts were drawn aside

  like a fortress this place remarked
grant innocently conversational

  the door swung open the summoned
pair stepped through turning on the
threshold raven said to grant it re-
minds me of a crematorium

  then the armor plate cut him from
view and the bolts slid back into place
grant stood a moment staring at the
door the concrete the great windowless
walls he felt cold cold

  it does at that what a lousy
thought

  moodily he took the copter up notic-
ing that somehow the sun had lost much
of its warmth

  behind the door stretched a long pas-
sage down which a distant voice came
drifting please continue straight
ahead you will find me in the room at
the end i regret not being there to
meet you but i know you will forgive
me

  seated in a chair behind a long low
	startling stories

desk major lomax proved to be a lean
individual in his early thirties he had
light blue eyes that gazed fixedly and
rarely blinked his fair hair was cropped
to a short bristle the most noteworthy
feature was his extreme pallor his fea-
tures were white almost waxy and one
side of them had a permanent tautness

  indicating a two-person pneumaseat
the only other resting place in the room
lomax said kindly sit there  thank
you for coming so promptly the blue
eyes went from raven to leina and
back again i apologize for not escort-
ing you from the door it is difficult for
me to stand much less walk

  im very sorry sympathized leina

  there was no easy way of detecting
the reaction a swift probe showed that
lomax was a top-grade telepath with an
exceptionally efficient shield his mind
was closed as securely as could be done
by any human despite that they might
have riven this defense with a simul-
taneous and irresistible thrust but by
mutual consent they refrained from try-
ing

titoving a thin pile of typewritten
papers in front of him lomax con-
tinued in the same cool unemotional
voice as before

  i dont know whether you now sus-
pect the purpose of this interview nor
can i foretell what action on your part
may be precipitated by it but before we
begin i want you to know that my func-
tion is prescribed here he tapped the
papers it has been worked out for me
in complete detail and all i must do is
follow it through as written

  you make it sound ominous offered
raven

  picking up the top sheet lomax read
from it first i have to give you a per-
sonal message from mr carson head of
terran intelligence to the effect that
when informed of this interview he dis-
approved of it opposed it by all legiti-
mate means at his command but was
overruled he wishes me to convey his
sincere regards and assure you that no

matter what may take place in this
building he will always hold both of you
in the greatest esteem

  dear me said raven this is get-
ting worse

  lomax let it go by with complete im-
passivity this interview will be con-
ducted only on a vocal basis it is being
recorded for the benefit of those who
arranged it

  putting the top sheet aside he picked
up the next one and continued in the
same robotlike way it is essential that
you know i have been chosen for my
present task because of a rare combina-
tion of qualifications i am a member of
terran intelligence a telepath well able
to cover his own mind and lastly very
much of a physical wreck

  glancing up he met leinas great
optics and for the first time displayed
the faintest shadow of expression in the
shape of a vague and swiftly suppressed
uneasiness like grant and many others
he was disturbed when looked into so
deeply

  he hurried on i shall not bore you
with the full details briefly i was in-
volved in an unlucky smash and badly
injured i want you to keep that in mind
because it is most important i am in
the abnormal mental state of a man
wholl be glad to go therefore i cannot
be intimidated by the threat of death
neither can we stated raven ami-
ably bland

  it disconcerted lomax a little he had
expected nothing less than a heated and
indignant demand as to who was threat-
ening his life concealing his surprise
he returned his attention to the papers

  further although i do not fear death
i shall be compelled to react to its ap-
proach in a quick and effective way i
have undergone a special course of men-
tal conditioning which has created a
purely reactive circuit within my mind
it is not part of my normal thinking
processes cannot be detected or de-
stroyed by any other mind probe this
circuit automatically keys in the instant
i am in serious danger of losing either
the star

my life or control of my free personality
it will force me to do something in-
stinctively unthinkingly the result of
which will be the immediate destruction
of us three

  raven frowned and commented
somewhere back of you is a badly
frightened man

  ignoring that lomax went deter-
minedly on what i shall do is not
known to me nor will it be until the
very moment  do it you have nothing
to gain by combining to beat down my
shield and search my mind for what isnt
consciously there on the contrary you
have everything to lose-your lives

xxvi

the pair on the pneumaseat glanced
at each other did their best to look out-
witted and aghast lomax had a part
to play-but so had they it was a curi-
ous situation without parallel in human
annals for each side was in mental hid-
ing from the other each was holding a
master card in the form of power over
life and death each knew that victory
for itself was certain

  looking at lomax who refused to
meet her gaze leina complained we
came here in good faith thinking per-
haps our help was needed we find our-
selves being treated like common crimi-
nals indeed it is worse than that for
no charge has been made against us and
we are denied the proper processes of
the law just what are we supposed to
have done to deserve all this

  exceptional methods must be applied
to exceptional cases remarked lomax
quite unmoved it is not so much what
you have done as what you may do even-
tually

  cant you be more explicit

  please be patient i am coming to
that right now he resumed with his
sheets this is a condensation of facts
sufficient to enable you to understand the
reason for this meeting certain matters
brought to the attention of the world
council 

watchers	

  by a schemer named thorstern
suggested raven picturing emmanuels
scowl when that came over the recording
system

      caused them to order a thorough
inquiry into the nature of your activi-
ties especially during your recent opera-
tions on behalf of terran intelligence
continued lomax stubbornly which
inquiry was later extended to this lady
with whom you-ahem-reside

  you make it sound nasty reproved
leina

  data was drawn from a large num-
ber of sources considered reliable and
the resulting report which was complete

to study it and issue a recommendation

tant raven slid a glance at leina who
responded with an i-told-you-so look

  composed of two world council
members and ten scientists this commis-
sion held that on the basis of the evi-
dence before them you had displayed
supernormal powers of eight distinct
classifications six known and two pre-
viously unknown you are both multi-
talented mutants

  is that an offense asked raven

  i have no personal views concerning
this matter the major leaned forward
held his middle a moment while his face
went even whiter when he recovered
he said kindly permit me to continue
if the evidence had favored no more than
that the world council would have ac-
cepted the fact that multitalented mu-
tants do exist in spite of so-called nat-
ural laws but there are data in support
of an alternative theory toward which
some members of the commission lean
while others reject it as fantastic

leina and raven stirred on the pneu-
maseat showed curiosity and mild
interest no more than that at every
moment they were living the part they
wished to play as determined as lomax
to see it through to the bitter end

  you are entitled to know the cogent
	startling stories

items lomax carried on he discarded
another sheet a careful re-examina-
tion of your antecedents shows that both
of you might well be persons very much
out of the ordinary by our standards of
today it was by substantially the same
method that mr carson traced you in
the first place and reached the same con-
clusion

  he paused while his features quirked
with an inward strain then said more
slowly but the ancestry of david
raven should at best have produced no
more than a superb telepath a mind
probe of redoubtable penetrating power
and extremely acute receptivity he
could not exercise hypnotic or quasihyp-
notic powers of his own even as a multi-
talented mutant because there is not one
hypno among his forebears

  that may be- began leina

  lomax chipped in the same remarks
apply to you they also apply to your
two confreres upon venus which pair
are now having the same kind of inter-
view in similar circumstances

  with a similar threat hanging over
them raven inquired

  lomax took no notice well disci-
plined he was answering no questions
other than those pertinent to the stage
reached in his task

  item number two we discovered that
david raven either had died or shown
all symptoms of death and then been
resuscitated the doctor who performed
this feat is himself dead and can no
longer be called upon for evidence such
things do happen it becomes remark-
able only when examined in conjunction
with other facts the blue eyes shot a
glance at leina such as the fact that
this lady once went swimming was
caught in a powerful undercurrent ap-
parently drowned but revived by arti-
ficial respiration there are also the
facts that your two prototypes on venus
also have had hairbreadth escapes
youve had one yourself raven
riposted you told us so at the begin-
ning youre lucky to be alive

  strongly tempted to admit the escape

but deny the luck of surviving in his
present condition lomax plowed grimly
on

  item number three has indirect sig-
nificance you have been told by mr
carson of terran space-ship experi-
ments so there is no harm in adding
more to cut it short our last exploring
vessel went very far into the void upon
its return the pilot reported that he had
been chased by unidentifiable objects of
unknown origin all that his instruments
could tell him was that they were metal-
lic and were radiating heat there were
four of them moving in line abreast at
a distance too great for examination
with the naked eye they changed course
when he changed and undoubtedly were
in pursuit they had greater maneuver-
ability and far more speed

  nevertheless he escaped  raven put
on an irritatingly skeptical smile

  the escape is as much a mystery as
the pursuit lomax reported the four
were overtaking rapidly when a few
strange sparkles and gleamings ap-
peared in front of them upon which they
swung into a reverse course and went
away our pilot is convinced that these
four were artificial fabrications and his
belief is officially endorsed

  what does this mean to us

  taking a deep breath lomax declared
there is other life in the cosmos its
form powers techniques and ways of
thought remain matters of pure specula-
tion it may be humanoid enough to pose
as veritable humans gaining plausibility
by using the identities of real humans
who have died he whisked aside an-
other paper or it might be parasitic
by nature able to seize and animate the
bodies of other creatures masquerading
thereafter in a guise mighty close to per-
fection we have no data to go upon
but we can think imagine conceive in-
finite possibilities

  frightened men have bad dreams
observed raven

  i think its all terribly silly leina
put in are you implying that we may
be intelligent parasites from heaven
the star watchers	

knows where she sneered

  lady i am implying nothing i am
merely reading papers prepared by my
superiors whose conclusions and motives
i am not inclined to question that is
my job

  where does it get us

  to this point in defiance of the rule
that only the dominant talent is inher-
ited you may be multitalented mutants
of natural human birth in which case
the laws of genetics will have to be modi-
fied on the other hand you may be a
nonhuman form of life disguised in our
shape and form living among us unsus-
pected until lately

  for what purpose

lmajor lomax passed a hand over
his bristly hair he looked mentally
and physically weary as he answered
the purposes of other life forms are
obscure we know nothing about them-
yet we can however make a justifiable
assumption

  and what is that

  another life form would make con-
tact openly without attempting conceal-
ment if its intentions were friendly

  meaning that surreptitious contact is
proof of hostile designs

  exactly

  leina said with some morbidity i
can think of nothing more absurd than
to suggest that human beings are not
human beings

  for the second time lady said
lomax displaying frigid politeness i
am not making suggestions i am no
more than a deputy appointed to inform
you of the conclusions of experts they
say that you two are either multitalented
mutants or nonhuman life forms and
more likely the latter

  i think theyre impertinent com-
plained leina becomiug femininely in-
consequential

  lomax let it pass if it should be the
case that some other form of life has
dumped scouts upon our worlds un-
known to us the logical deduction is that
their ultimate purpose is antagonistic

its the criminal who climbs in through
the back window the honest man
knocks on the front door hence this
unusual procedure alien invaders stand
outside our laws and are not entitled to
the protection of them

  i see raven rubbed his chin re-
garded the other thoughtfully what
are we supposed to do about all this wild
speculation

  the onus now rests on you of prov-
ing beyond all manner of doubt that you
are natural-born humans and not an-
other life form the proof has to be good
and watertight

xxvii

shaven growled in pretended anger
darn it can you prove youre not some-
thing out of sirius

  i wont argue with you or permit
you to disturb my emotions lomax
jabbed an indicative thumb at the last
sheet of paper all im concerned with
is what it says here tt says you will pro-
duce incontrovertible proof that you are
human beings by which is meant the
kind of superior life native to terra
otherwise

  terra will take steps to protect her-
self by every means available for a
start she will wipe out all three of us
here simultaneously deal with those on
venus and make ready to repel any later
attack launched upon us from outside

  hm all three of us you say tough
on you isnt it

  i told you why i was chosen lomax
reminded him ive been assured that
the method to be employed will be super-
swift and painless

  that is a great comfort put in
leina

  he eyed them in turn i shall go
with you to deprive you of the last possi-
ble way out there will be no chance of
one of you insuring survival by confis-
cating my person no other life form-
if such you are-is going to walk out of
this trap in the disguise of a man named
lomax we survive together or die to-
	startling stories

gether according to whether or not you
produce the evidence my superiors re-
quire

  lomax was slightly pleased about
that for the first time the physical con-
dition he resented had given him power
of the most unconquerable kind in com-
mon with those behind him he was tak-
ing it for granted that any form of life
human or nonhuman would value its
survival too highly to share his own ab-
normal nonchalance about destruction

  in that respect neither he nor those
who had planned this situation could
have been more mistaken the difficult
thing was for prospective victims to
conceal this fact the essential tactic
was not to reveal it outwardly and to
give the blind recording apparatus a
series of reactions manifestly natural
from the human point of view

so in suitably disturbed tones raven
remarked many an innocent has
been slaughtered by the chronic suspi-
cions and uncontrollable fears of others
the world has never lacked its full quota
of smellers-out of witches he fidgeted
as if on edge and asked how long do
we have to talk ourselves out of the bon-
fire is there a time limit

   there is but its not on the clock
then on what basis is it fixed
either you dig up the proof or you
dont lomax registered tired indiffer-
ence as to which way it went if you
can youll start trying if you cant the
knowledge that you cant will drive you
to desperation sooner or later when
that happens- he let his voice trail
off

  youll react

  effectively im very patient and
youre free to take full advantage of it
but i advise you not to play for time by
trying to sit here for a week

  that sounds like another threat

  it is a warning lomax corrected
although they have given far less cause
for suspicion the pair on venus are
classified with you and are being given
the same treatment all four of you are

of precisely the same type and will be
released or executed together

  so a coupling exists between here
and there raven inquired

  correct emergency action here
causes a signal to be sent which precipi-
tates the same action there the same
holds good in reverse thats why weve
kept the two pairs apart the more time
one pair wastes the greater the chance
of the issue being settled for them by the
other pair you are in the unhappy posi-
tion of the man who remarked that he
could cope with his enemies but only
god could save him from his friends
emitting a deep sigh raven lay back
and closed his eyes as if concentrating on
the problem in hand that lomax might
listen to his thoughts did not worry
him in the least he had complete con-
fidence in his own mental shield and in
the inability of any earth-type telepath
to tune to so high a neural band
charles charles

  the response was long in coming be-
cause the others mind was absorbed in
his predicament and had to be drawn
away it came eventually

  yes david

  how far have you got

  were being told how four denebs
took after a terran but were turned
away

  youre lagging behind us then were
near the end here whos dealing with
you

  a very old man quick-witted but on
his last legs

  weve got a young one raven said
rather a sad case so much so that it
wouldnt be thought extraordinary if he
had a serious attack or collapsed before
were through it would appear that the
strain had been too much for him i
think we can cover up by taking advan-
tage of his condition

  what do you propose

  well feed the recording system a lit-
tle drama well establish a semblance
of innocence then hell have his attack
and well react naturally he will also
react because he cant help it the result
the star

will get you out of your fix because we
here will have denied you the chance to
say a word in your defense

   how long will it be

   only a few minutes

   opening his eyes and sitting up in the
manner of one who has discovered a
bright and hopeful solution raven said
look if the life of david raven is now
known in detail it will be obvious that
if his body was taken at all it must have
been at the time of his death and pseudo-
resuscitation

  no comment said lomax others
will decide that point

   theyll agree raven asserted posi-
tively now if we accept the far-fetched
notion that some other life form could
take over the material body of another
creature how could it also confiscate
something so immaterial as that crea-
tures memories

  dont ask me i am not an expert
major lomax made a brief note on a pad

   if i can relate a wealth of childhood
memories from the age of three up-
ward continued raven with an excel-
lent imitation of triumph and have ev-
ery one of them confirmed by persons
still living where do i stand then 

  i dont know said lomax the
suggestion is now being considered else-
where a signal will tell me whether or
not you may extend the theme

   what if i show that during my youth
i self-consciously suppressed my powers
knowing that i was a freak is it not
true that by definition a freak is a de-
parture from the norm on which natural
laws are based what if i show that the
alleged coincidence of four similar
freaks in a bunch is attributable to no
more than that birds of a feather flock
together

   it may suffice or it may not lomax
evaded we shall hear pretty soon if
youve anything more to offer nows the
time

glancing around raven saw the
recorder leads buried deep in the
wall the tiny pin in the floor near lo-

watchers	

maxs right foot the connections run-
ning from it to a machine in the cellars
he could even view the machine and
estimate the efficiency of the lethal ray
it was designed to produce

  he and leina had become aware of all
these things at the very first it would
have been easy to detach various leads
remotely without moving from the
pneumaseat it would have been easy to
jam the pin or break the power supply
to the concealed executioner the way
out was wide open and had been right
from the start there was only one
serious obstacle in the route to freedom
a successful break would have been a
complete giveaway

  concealment was the real issue no
fragment of truth must lurk in any
biped mind humans lived in protective
ignorance and should continue to do so
at whatever cost as for the freedom
beckoning beyond the armor-plate door
it was only a poor restricted third-rate
kind of liberty a plaster and cardboard
model of the real thing

  carelessly his hand touched leinas
making them of one accord there were
no scanners to watch what was about
to occur there was only the recording
system the lethal projector and the little
pin

  leina pressed davids hand

  there are and always have been un-
known mutants in addition to known
ones he said making it pleadingly
persuasive its a fact that makes an-
cestral data inadequate and misleading
if my great grandfather being an un-
mitigated scoundrel took great care to
conceal his hypnotic powers which he
preserved solely for illegal purposes
then it stands to sense-

  he broke off waited while leina con-
tributed an obliging yelp of oh david
look and right on top of it shouted
whats the matter lomax

  at the same moment both minds
thrust with irresistible power through
the others mental shield lomax had no
time to inquire what the devil they were
talking about or to denv that anythin v
	startling stories

was the matter automatically his foot
rammed down on the hidden pin

  for a fragmentary moment his mind
shrieked aloud ive done it heavens
above ive- and then his cry was cut
off

xxvm

     period of soul-searing chaos and
absolute bewilderment followed lomax
did not know could not tell whether it
was long or short a matter of seconds
or eons he did not know whether it was
now light or dark cold or warm
whether he was standing up or lying
down moving or still

  what had occurred when he pressed
that pin had some new and awful de-
vice been tested on himself and the other
two guinea pigs had it hurled him into
the past the future or into some other
dimension or worse still oh infinitely
worse had it added a multilated mind to
his mutilated body

  then it struck him that he could no
longer feel the throbbing agony that had
made his life a personal hell these last
two years sheer surprise and an over-
whelming flood of relief stopped his
minds mad whirling he began to co-
ordinate slowly uncertainly like a little
child

  it now seemed that he was floating
amid a mighty host of brilliant bubbles
large and small all around him they
drifted lazily along shining in superbly
glowing colors while among them pale
wisps of smoke wreathed and curled he
was he thought like a tiny rudderless
boat on a wide iridescent river

  the pain was gone and there was only
this sleepy dreamy swaying along the
mainstream of blue and green crimson
and gold starry sparklings of purest
white fitful gleams of silver momen-
tary flashings of little rainbows on on
into the infinitude of peace he was in-
clined to sleep and was content to
slumber for ever and ever for as long
as time went on

but then his mind stirred as a sense

became active and prodded it into atten-
tion it now seemed that with the palely
curling gleams of smoke amid the
bubbles came an immense multitude of
voices all speaking one tongue

  some talked in quick staccato phrnes
from places afar others were nearer
and more leisured it was strange that
though each was fully audible he could
tell somehow-he did not know how-
the precise direction from which each
came and the distance of its source rela-
tive to the others a few were near him
very near voicing mysterious things
among the wreaths of smoke the
spheres and the colors

  stay with him

  he may not be vengeful but stay
with him we want no more impulses
like steens

  he said he was ready for this so he
should be quicker to adapt

  he must learn that no man can be an
enemy

  more senses swung into operation in
a confused out-of-focus way he became
conscious that the entities he had known
as raven and leina were still present
sharing his dream-environment they
were holding him without actually
touching him drifting with him through
the smoke and the bubbles they were
not the same yet he knew who they were
beyond all doubt

all at once this hazy sense of percep-
tion that was not sight cleared itself
adjusted sprang into full and complete
functioning the myriad bubbles wafted
away as if blown by a tremendous
breath and took up new positions at
immense distances they were suns and
planets glowing and spinning within
the great spaces of eternal dark

  his new vision was nonstereoscopic
devoid of perspective but had in lieu
an automatic and extremely accurate
estimation of relative distances he
knew merely by looking which bubbles
were near which far and exactly how
much farther

  still with the other two he heard one
the star watchers	

cry charles mavis and a reply eerily
vibrating from far away coming
david i the names used were not those
names but he thought of them as those
names because he could not gi-asp the
new ones but knew to whom they re-
ferred

  the surfaces of many spheres could
be seen in splendid detail on many of
them creatures lived and swarmed-
hoppers creepers crawlers fiutterers
flame-things wave-form entities being
of infinite variety and most of them
comparatively low in the scale of life

  but one widespread form was high it
had a long thin sinuous body covered
by dark gray hide a well developed and
efficient brain many dexterous limbs
and esp-organs it enjoyed telepathic
power confined to its own especial band
its individuals could compute as indi-
viduals or combine mentally to compute
as a mass mind they roamed far and
wide in pencil-shaped jet black space-
vessels exploring other worlds patrol-

  ling the gulfs and chasms between map-
ping charting reporting and always
ceaselessly searching

  the denebs

  these were the lords of creation in
their own esteem absorbing data being
fed to him from he knew not where lo-
max understood a lot about the denebs
they were at the top of the scale of
bubble-bound creatures had great tol-
erance for all other life forms consid-
ered lower than themselves but they
could not abide the thought of sharing
the cosmos with another who was equal
or higher

  and there was one still higher

  so the denebs were feverishily hunt-
ing for the home world or worlds whence
came this unbearable competition they
would destroy rivalry at its source if
the source could be found their black
ships prowled and poked and probed and
searched amid the endless multitude of
bubbles disturbing but not harming the

hoppers creepers crawlers and some-
times the little white grublike bipeds
established on many widely separated
spheres

  lomax felt a peculiarly intense in-
terest in this last type of creature poor
little grubs squirming and wriggling
around building or trying to build or
hoping ultimately to build rudimeiary
ramshackle rocket-ships that never
would touch more than the fringes of
creation mournful grubs sorrowing
ones ecstatic ones ambitious ones even
petty dictator grubs

  in all probability there were among
them individuals a mere fraction better
endowed than their fellows and who
thought themselves far superior because
they could exercise a minute fragmen-
tary portion of powers entirely normal
but said to be supernormal

  doubtless every colony of them had
evolved a grub culture a grub philoso-
phy and being unable to conceive any-
thing infinitely higher might go so far
as to think of themselves as made in the
image of a colossal supergrub

  now and again one more daring than
the rest might have sneaked from the
hiding place of its own grub-condition-
ing and peered furtively into the dark
and seen a great bright-eyed moth like
a nocturnal butterfly beating gloriously
through the everlasting night then it
would cower down sorely afraid totally
unable to recognize-itself

an enormous surge of life filled
lomaxs being as the data filed itself
and became estimated the grubs the
nestlings filled with tremendous
power he saw raven and leina charles
and mavis as he had never seen anyone
before they were with him still urging
him to adapt to the environment

  the little two-legged grubs he was

  crying ours our nestlings waiting for
their metamorphosis if the denebs
long unable to recognize them for what
they were should now learn the truth
from one mind in one colony they will
systematically destroy the lot if one
grub learns too much all may be slaugh-
tered

  never said the one he had known
as raven it will never be known to
any of them there are two watchers in
every nest each living inside a grub
body they are guardians they enter
with permission exactly as i took the
discarded form of david raven with his
permission they enter in pairs it needs
one to watch but two to break material
solitude

  the place we left you left

  two more already have gone in
they began to leave him moving si-
lently into the great deeps that were
their natural playfields the denebs
were highest of the bubble-bound but
these the higher ones were bound to
nothing once their childhoods grub-
existence had ended they went like
wide-eyed supersensitive multitalented
creatures of the great spaces

  those pale weak two-legged things
wondered lomax what did they call
themselves ah yes homo sapiens
some among them regarded themselves
as homo superior it was pitiful in a
way it was pathetic

  as instinctively as a baby moves the
feet it is not consciously aware of
possessing or a kitten similarly puts
forth claws so did he spread great
shining fan-shaped fields of force and
swoop in the wake of his fellows

  he was alive and filled with a fierce
exultation for he knew what he had be-
come and what the little white grubs
had yet to be

lost art

a novelet of the treasuret of the patt by bertram chandler
grease  the pan

by sam merwin jr

ur ka-ta had painstakingly
briefed for his assignment as was
customary when a solo field expedition
was assigned by the mlrata on an alien
world as his little silver-hued space
sledge took off under its own power
from a port in the flush surface of the
huge exploratory craft he recapitulated
his instructions

  first of course was the fulfillment
of purpose purpose in this instance
was to discover dominant intelligent
species on the third planet of this mid-
dle-magnitude sun second aim of as-
signment was study of dominant spe-
cies to discover their intelligence level
and receptivity to alien life then and

only then came the matter of contact

  contact with other intelligent species
throughout the galaxy was of recent
and paramount importance to the
mlrata since their scientists had deter-
mined that their own star cluster was
doomed to volatility in a matter of a
mere few thousand orbits they were
going to need new and habitable planets
and not being of primitive and com-
bative nature were seeking friendly
hosts

  the mlrata had much to offer they
were probably the most civilized life-
form of the universe having progressed
to the one hundred and second level of
philosophy the forty third level of self-

they needed new planets to populate


	startling stories

analysis-always a difficult subject-
and the sixty sixth levt of pure thought
they could control weather and climate
through communitv thought  could
adapt their formvs bodies to almost
any life-forms they could produce
nutrients from chaired rock could rear
great cities and other structures as
easily as their infants could build vac-
cuum toys

  in his present form ur ka-ta was a
living tribute to mlrata adaptability
and mental ingenuity after careful
study he had been worked into a close
copy of what long-range observation
had showed the mlrata expedition ex-
perts to be representative of one of the
probable dominants

  it was no costume he was wearing
and nothing as primitive as a plastic
skin he was the species and if his
metamorphosis entailed certain restric-
tions upon his action his mlrata mind
was supposed to make up for it in days
gone by long-range observation of the
planet would have been deemed suffi-
cient now in this time of urgency it
was thought better to send down a scout
in person occasionally long-range
observation failed to account for the
paradoxes that occasionally lurked dan-
gerously on individual planets

  ur ka-ta was a typical representative
of the species that seemed to swarm
over most of this green-bue planets
surface he felt the slight warmth as
his sledge raced meteorlike through
the thin outer atmosphere and slowed
it telepathically to keep it from being
burned as it reached heavier layers of
air

he was moving very slowly when at
last his sledge made contact with
the surface he left the sledge in its
protective envelope and went out of it
onto a world hitherto untouched by
mlrata

  breathing of course was difficult-
or would have been had ur ka-ta re-
quired the process to continue living
as it was he simply shut off the vents of

his lungs and did without-although
he gave the semblance of breathine for
the benefit of possible watchers he let
his mind rove moved swiftly toward
where his telepathic sense informed him
were great numbers of beings like him-
self

  in the thick atmosphere around him
his appendages proved less awkward
than he had feared they would be soon
he found himself in a crowded thorough-
fare extending between lofty terraces
that rose toward the sky he kept him-
self out of the whirl of traffic watching
its components studying them seeking

  on the whole he was disappointed he
found little evidence of the intelligence
he had been led to expect there was
emotion here much of it-fear anger
hunger-but he got an impression of
function fulfilled for its own sake
rather than from intellectual choice
many wore gay decorative raiment but
even these seemed to be more concerned
with food and security than with aes-
thetics

  far above the towers he saw the
underside of a great artifact in shape
not unlike the space-ship from which he
had descended to this strange planet it
moved swiftly majestically on its way
more important it was evidence of true
intelligence at work

  after a moment of thought ur ka-ta
moved swiftly through the traffic lanes
in the direction from which the ship
had come he had obtained from it a
new thought-pattern was able to pur-
sue it like some homing bird of this alien
world

  it was an uphill journey but ur ka-ta
lacked any facility for fatigue he de-
bated once whether it might not be
wiser to return to his space-sledge and
employ its greater speed but decided
against it there could be too much risk
of discovery and discovery could con-
ceivably spell peril to his parent ship
hovering silent and unobserved far
above the surface he now traveled

  after awhile ur ka-ta found himself
in a narrow highland valley whose tur-
grease in the par	

bulent atmosphere made progress diffi-
cult he went on doggedly however for
he knew he was drawing close to the
type of intelligence that had built the
vessel he had seen far above him

  because of his purposeful progress he
went his way without molestation until
a strange eerie looking object a sort of
moving tuft danced annoyingly in front
of him forgetting his guise he
sought to push it aside with a tendril
forgetting he was not allowed tendrils
on this assignment

  instead his jaws moved apparently
of their owm accord and he felt some-
thing sharp and barbed pierce the under
side of his mouth abruptly he was
yanked toward the side of the valley

  he put up a whale of a battle the
barb was attached to a strong line but
one which ordinarily he could have
snapped with a thought as it was
hampered by his guise he could only
seek to break it since he could not dis-
lodge the barb without tendrils had it
not been for his indefatigability he
would quickly have lost the struggle for
his existence

  even so it could only end one way
all at once he felt himself lifted from
the heavy atmosphere that covered two
thirds of this alien world it was be-
cause of the nature of this atmosphere

that he had been given this particular
life-form as a probable dominant he
realized the mlrata experts error as
soon as he felt the mentalities of the big
biped at the other end of the line

  it was another alien planet paradox
here by some odd mischance the domi-
nant species did not come from the
dominant type of environment almost
instantaneously ur ka-ta extended his
telepathic powers seeking contact and
having gained it control of these bipeds
who were seeking to kill him for sport

tee gamblers

you lie there cold and sweating
at the same time youre nau-
seated and your insides hurt
from all the retching youve done your
throat bums a little too but youre a
gambler and this is your gamble to keep
alive until your ship comes in-the
space-ship that is for you so aptly
named the relief

  youve got to stay alive for longer
than you care to think about how many
more days you dont know-youve
lost track of time and of day and night
thirty-nine days-terrestrial days-al-
together from the time the relief left
you here until its due to pick you up
again but you dont know right now
how many days have gone by and how
many remain why did you forget to
wind your watch and make marks on
the wall for days as a prisoner does in
his cell to count the days until hell be
free again

  you cant read to help pass the time
even if you felt well enough to enjoy
reading because the aliens took all your
books youd gladly give up your life to
be able to write but you cant write a
word because of that psychic compul-
sion they put on you under hypnosis
you cant remember the shape of a sin-
gle letter even the sound of a single
letter let alone how to spell a whole
word

  youll have to learn to write all over
again unless it turns out that the sight
of printing or writing brings back your
memory when you have a chance to see
some again they saw to it that there
isnt a letter of printing anywhere in
this tiny dome not so much as a serial
number on an oxygen tank or a label on
a tube of toothpaste

  of course they took all writing mate-
rials and paper too but you could prob-
ably find something to scratch on the
wall with if only you knew how to write
you try-you think the word cat and
you know the sound of it and what a cat
is but for the life of you you cant
imagine how it would be written
whether with two letters or ten the
very concept of what a letter is almost
eludes you you dont quite see how you
can put a sound on paper yes its hope-
less without help to try to break that
block they put in your mind you might
as well quit struggling against it

  at least youll be able to talk if you
manage to live until your ship comes in
and youve got to live so youll be able
to tell them not that you want to live
the way you feel now but youve got
to if you have to fight for every breath
then all right youll fight your own life
is the least of it

  youre getting sick at your stomach
again well dont think about it think
a novelet by mack reynolds 

            fredric brown

      bob thayer was no card sharp but he got into a poker game
      on the moon-with the fate of the earth at stake


	startling stories

about something else remember your
trip here from earth good old earth
think about it to get your mind off your
guts

ldemember the take-off how much
it scared you and how much you
marveled at all that you knew-directly
or indirectly-was going on the valves
opening the pumps beginning to stir
the liquid hydrogen and the ozone of the
booster device beginning to gush into
the motor the vibration that told you
the initial ignition was taking place the
relief stirring sluggishly on its apron

  the roar of the booster already
clearly audible miles away inside the
ship the sound was heavy thunderous
penetrating and then the unknown un-
analyzable terrors brought on by the
subsonic vibrations there was noise on
every level of sound those that human
ears could hear and those they couldnt
hear no ear plugs could block out
the supersonics and the subsonics you
didnt really hear them with your ears
at all but with your whole body

  yes the take-off had been your big-
gest thrill in life up to then much as it
seemed to bore the captain and the
three-man crew of the relief it was
your first take-off and their twentieth
or thirtieth well you had one more
coming-the return trip to earth-if
you lived until the relief came back for
you and youd settle for that-gladly
youd go back to your regular job in the
lab of the observatory

  one trip to the moon and back with
a thirty-nine-day stay there should be
enough of an adventure for any man
who isnt a spaceman and doesnt ever
expect to become one and one mess like
that youre in right now should be
enough to satisfy anybody for the rest
of his life only the rest of your life
may be a matter of minutes or hours
if the aliens figured wrong or if you
did 

  keep your mind away from that
youre going to live all right youve
beaten them-you hope it doesnt do

any good to worry about it youre do-
ing all you can do just lying here trying
to be as quiet as you can so youll use as
little oxygen as possible they left you
barely enough food barely enough
water but the oxygen is your really
tough problem not quite barely
enough

  yet you just might make it if you
make no unnecessary move to increase
your oxygen consumption sleep is best
-you use less oxygen when you sleep
but you cant sleep all the time in fact
sick and miserable as you are you cant
manage to sleep much at all

  all you can do is lie quiet and think
think about anything think why
youre here

  youre here because-along with a lot
of other observatory technicians-you
answered an ad in the astronomy
journal an ad that excited you wanted
techninian young and in good health
to spend between one and two months
alone in small observatory dome on the
moon to make series of photographs of
earth for meteorological study must
know ogden star camera and use of
filters do own developing of plates
must be psychologically stable

  it didnt say-must be able to give
poker instruction to alien life forms
but you cant blame the american mete-
orological society for that there arent
any life forms on the moon-not even
human ones on any permanent basis
nothing here really worth the trouble
except a little observatory like this one
two or twenty years from now when
they have rockets ready to make the try
for mars and venus theyll build bases
here of course but nothing much has
been done yet beyond the surveying
stage

  yes right now at this moment you
are quite possibly the only human being
on the moon or if there are any others
they are thousands of miles away be-
cause the bases are being built in craters
near the rim and this little dome you
are in is located dead center almost of
the earthward side
the gamblers	

  well a fat lot of work youve done
you havent taken a single picture with
the ogden not your fault of course-
the aliens took the ogden along with
them and you cant take pictures with-
out a camera can you 

 wasting thirty-nine days-two
months really counting traveling time
and training time-and you wont have
a picture to show for it but if you die
they cant blame you for that quit

always be directly overhead but thered
be heat loss more through the glass
alone than through the glass plus the in-
sulated sliding door so you cant risk
it

  the aliens left you only a third of
your complement of storage batteries
barely enough to see you through bare-
ly enough of everything so thered be
no chance that you could-by some
chemistry alien to them-change some-

   preachers may rant from the pulpit economists may point out all sorts of utter
   wastage and reformers may hunt down numbers racketeers by the gross-but people
   are going to keep right on gambling furthermore it seems at least theoretically
   possible that the gambler especially in games that require mental skill is in general
   a higher type of human than the non-gambler

      it takes skill judgment and nerve as weu as knowledge wisdom and experience to
   compute in a matter of seconds the shaping up of a hand of contract bridge or the
   probabilities of pulling out a hand of canasta after the opposition has set up camp in
   the discard pile it takes keenly accurate judgment of character to run a poker bluff
   successfully and it takes mathematical wizardry and eidetic memory to calculate a
   roulette system against the house percentage

      skill judgment nerve wisdom experience accurate character judgment mathe-
   matical wizardry and eidetic memory-surely these are all qualities belonging to
   homo superior rather than homo sapiens and surely the proficient card player is
   more apt to have such qualities in running order than the man who insists that
   gambling is strictly for suckers or flunkeys of beelzebub

     and now messrs reynolds and brown have come up with what is probably the
   damnedest poker game ever conceived of in fiction-and one in which the stakes range
   far beyond the mere life of the lone earthman involved we hope all you homo
   superiors enjoy it

-the editor

thinking that way-youre not going to
die-you darent die

font think about dying think
- about anything think about get-
ting here about how captain thorkel-
sen of the relief dropped you off here-
how many days ago three or thirty
more than three surely more than three
if only the opaque sliding door of the
top of this little dome were open so you
could see through the glass you could
tell at least whether its moon-day or
moon-night

  you could see the earth and watch it
spin around one terrestrial day for
every spin and youd know how long
youd been here and how long there was
to go and moon-day or moon-night
you could always see it because it would

thing else into the oxygen of which they
didnt leave you quite enough

  sure you can open the door at in-
tervals to look out and then close it
again before too much heat escapes but
that takes physical energy and physical
energy and exercise use up oxygen you
cant risk moving a finger except when
you have to

 captain thorkelsen shaking your
hand saying well mr thayer-or
maybe i should call you bob now that
the trips over and we dont have to be
formal-youre on your own now back
for you in thirty-nine days to the hour
and youll be plenty ready to go back
by then let me tell you

  but thorkelsen hadnt guessed even
remotely how ready hed be

  you grinned at him and said i smug-
	startling stories

gled something captain one pint of
the best bonded bourbon i could get to
celebrate my landing on the moon
hows about coming into the dome with
me for a drink

  he shook his head regretfully
sorry bob but orders are orders we
take off in an hour exactly from time of
landing and thats enough time for you
to get into a spacesuit and get there-
well watch through the port until we
see you enter the door of the dome but
it isnt enough time-quite-for us to
get into suits and get there and back
and out of the suits again in time to
take off you know how schedules are in
this business

  yes you know how schedules are in
spacefiying and thats how you know-
for better and for worse-that the
relief wont be fifteen minutes early
getting here to pick you up nor will it
be fifteen minutes late thirty-nine
days means thirty-nine days not thirty-
eight or forty

  so you nodded agreement and under-
standing you said well in that case
cant we open the pint here and now for
a drink around

  thorkelsen laughed and said i dont
see why not theres no rule against
taking a drink out here-only a rule
against transporting liquor and if
youve already violated that 

  for five men the pint of bonded
makes an even two drinks around and
theyre helping you into the cumber-
some space suit while youre drinking
the second one and theyre no longer
anonymous spacemonkeys to you after
three days of close contact en route
theyre dealt tommy ev and shorty
but deak although you call him that to
yourself you call captain even
though he calls you bob now some-
how captain fits thorkelsen better
than deak does anyway theyre all
swell fellows you wonder if youll ever
see them again

ii

but you pull your mind away from
the present and send it back into the

past the distant past that may have
been only a few days ago you got into
the airlock with your luggage two
tremendous cases you could barely have
lifted on earth but that you can carry
here quite easily even cumbered by a
spacesuit and you wave goodbye at
them because your face-plate is closed
and you cant talk to them any more
and they wave back and close the inner
door of the airlock then the air hisses
out-although you cant hear it-and
the outer door opens

  and there is the moon the hard rock
surface is five feet down but no ladder
has been rigged in moon gravity it
isnt necessary you throw the suit-
cases out and down and see them land
lightly without breaking and that gives
you the nerve to jump yourself you
land so lightly that you stumble and fall
and you know theyre probably watch-
ing you through the port and laughing
at you but that its friendly laughter so
you dont mind

  you get up and thumb your nose at
the port of the ship and then get the
cases and start toward the dome only
forty yards away youre glad youve
got the heavy cases to weight you down
even carrying them you weigh less than
on earth and you have to pick your way
carefully over the rough-smooth igneous
rock

  you reach the outer lock of the dome
-its a projection that looks like the
passageway-door of an eskimo igloo-
and open the door and then you turn
and wave and you can see them wave
back

  you dont waste time because you
want to get inside while theyre still
there if the airlock should stick-not
that they ever do youve been as-
sured-or if anything should be wrong
inside you want to get out again in time
to wave to them or warn them one of
them will stay at the port until they
take off which will be in about ten
minutes

  you take one more look at the dome
from the outside-its a hemisphere
twenty feet high and forty feet across
the gamblers	

at the base it looks big but it will
seem small from the inside after
youve been there a while the supply
cabinets and the hydroponic garden
take up quite a bit of room and of
whats left half is living quarters and
half workshop

  you enter the outer door and close it
behind you the little light that goes
on automatically shows you the handle
you turn to make it airtight you pull
the lever that starts air hissing into the
lock you watch a gauge until it shows
air pressure normal and then you reach
out and open the inner door that leads
to the dome itself

  its all ready for you the previous
trip of the relief brought and installed
the ogden and the other equipment
youll need made a thorough inspec-
tion of everything you and your duffle
are all the current trip had to bring

  you open the inner lock and step in
and for seconds you think youre stark
raving crazy

  there they are three of them and
you dont doubt once you know theyre
really there and that youre not seeing
things that theyre aliens with a capi-
tal a theyre humanoid but they
arent human theyve got the right
number of arms and legs even of eyes
and ears but the proportions are
different theyre about five feet tall
with brown leathery skins and they
dont wear clothes theyre all males
-theyre near enough human so you
can tell that

  you drop the cases youre carrying
and turn to rush back into the airlock
maybe you can get out again in time
to wave to the relief good lord it
cant leave these are the first extra-
terrestrial beings and this is the big-
gest news that ever happened youve
got to get the news back to earth

  this is more important than the first
landing on the moon ten years before
more important than the a-bomb
twenty years before that more impor-
tant than anything are they intelli-
gent a little anyway or they couldnt

have got through that airlock you
want to try to communicate with them
you want to do everything at once but
the relief will be blasting off in a
minute or two so that comes first

you whirl around and get halfway
a through the door a voice in your
mind says stop

  telepathy-theyre telepathic and
that word was an order-but if you
obey it or even stop to explain the
relief will be gone you keep on going
trying to hurl a thought at them a
thought of hurry of the fact that
youll come back that you welcome
them that youre friendly but that a
train is pulling out you hope they can
get that thought and unscramble it or
that they wont do anything about it
even if they dont understand

  youre almost through the door the
inner door something stops you you
cant move youre getting faint then
the floor shakes under your feet and
thats the ship taking off youd have
been too late anyway

  you try to turn back but you still
cant move and youre getting fainter
you black out and fall you dont feel
yourself hit the floor

  you come to again and youre lying
on the floor your spacesuit has been
taken off youre looking up into an in-
human face not necessarily an evil
face but an inhuman one

  the thought enters your mind are
you all right it isnt your own
thought

  you try to find out if youre all right
you think you are except that its a
little hard to breathe-as though there
isnt enough oxygen in the air

 the thought we lowered the
oxygen contcnt to suit our own metab-
olism i perceive that it is uncomfort-
able for you but will not be fatal i
perceive that otherwise you are un-
harmed the head turns-the thought
is directed elsewhere but you still get
it camelon it says you owe me
forty units on that bet that reduces
startling stories



the total i owe you for today to seventy
units

  what bet you think

  i bet him you would require a
greater amount of oxygen than we
you are free to stand and move about
if you wish we have searched you and
this place for weapons

  you sit up-youre a little dizzy
who are you where are you from
you ask

  you need not speak aloud comes
the thought we can read your mind
your more limited mind can read ours
when we wish to let it do so-as now
my name is borl my companions are
camelon and david yes i perceive
that the name david is common among
you too it is coincidence of course
we are of the race of the tharn we
come from a planet in a very distant
system for reasons of our own secu-
rity i shall not tell you where or how
far with relation to your own system
your name is bobthayer you are from
the planet earth of which this plane-
toid is a satellite

  you nod a useless gesture you get
to your feet a bit wobbly and look
around the largest of the three aliens
catches your eye and you get the
thought i am camelon i am the lead-
er

  so you think pleased to meet you
pal you look at the other and think
you too david you find you can tell
them apart camelon is inches taller
than either of the others david has a
crooked-well you guess its his nose
borl the one who was bending over you
when you came back to consciousness
has a much flatter face than either of
the others his skin is darker more
weathered-looking

  probably he is older than either of
the others yes i am older the
thought comes into your mind it
frightens you youve got less privacy
than youd have in a turkish bath

  ten units david you owe me ten
units you recognize it as camelons
thought how you can recognize a

thought as easily as you recognize a
voice you dont know but you can you
wonder why david owes camelon ten
units

  i bet him that you would be friend-
ly and you are you are a little re-
pelled by our physical appearance
bobthayer but so are we by yours
however you harbor no immediate
thoughts of violence against us

  why should i you wonder

  because we must kill you before we
leave however since you seem harm-
less we shall be glad to let you live
until then that we may study you

  thats nice you say

  how odd camelon borl thinks
that he can say one thing aloud and
think another we must remember that
if by any chance we should ever speak
to one of these people by any means of
communication from a distance they
lie like the primitives of the fourth
planet of centauri

  you dont lie you think but you
murder

  it is murder only to kill a tharn
not one of the lesser beings the uni-
verse was made for the tharn lesser
races serve them you owe me ten more
units david his fear of death is great-
er than ours despite the fact that our
life time is a thousand times his you
felt it when he learned that we must
kill him

  and it is strange elsewhere in the
universe the fear of death is propor-
tionate to the length of life well it
will make for an easier conquest of
earth his planet if they are afraid to
die ah not too easy-perceive what
he is thinking now they will fight

suddenly you wish theyd killed
you rather than stripped you of
your thoughts this way or is there
any way you can kill them

  dont try it camelon thinks at
you you are without weapons and
although smaller than you we are ap-
proximately as strong besides any
one of us can paralyze you with his
the gamblers	

mind-or make you unconscious	think that

  we do not in fact use physical
weapons at all the idea is repugnant
to us we fight with our minds only
either in individual combat or when we
conquer a lesser race yes t perceive
you are thinking this would be in-
formation your race would like to
know unfortunately you cannot live
to warn them

  camelon- borls thought -ill
bet you twenty units that we are
physically stronger than he

  taken the proof ah he came in
carrying those two cases one in either
hand easily lift them

  borl tried he could and did but
with some difficulty you win came-
lon

  you think how much these-well
you suppose theyre people in a way-
like to make bets they seem to bet on
everything

  we do borl thought it is our
greatest pleasure i perceive you have
others beside gambling gambling in a
thousand forms is our passion and our
relaxation everything else we do is
purposeful yes i perceive that you
have other pleasures-you escape real-
ity with stimulants narcotics read-
ing

  you take pleasure in the necessary
act of reproduction you enjoy contests
of speed and endurance-either as
participants or spectators-you enjoy
the taste of food whereas to us eating
is a disgusting but necessary evil most
ridiculous of all you enjoy games of
skill even when there is no wager in-
volved

  you know all that about yourself
and what you enjoy but are you ever
going to enjoy any of it again no
we are sorry but you are not

  sorry are they maybe if you take
them by surprise-

  but you dont suddenly youre
paralyzed you cant move even before
you really try you cant act before
you think and its useless otherwise
the paralysis ends the minute you

  you can move again but youve never
been more helpless in your life if you
could only raise an arm to swing  

  you can-and then you realize that
its too late the aliens have gone and
youre here alone and dying but youre
maybe a little delirious and you are
here now and not then and that part of
it is all over all over but the dying-
and the honing that you wont die that
your gamble worked sure you can
gamble too

  you pant for breath and your insides
gripe and youre cold and hungry and
thirsty because they left you barely
enough of everything to survive and
then-as they thought and maybe they
were right-they stacked the odds
hopelessly against you through thirty-
nine days of hell and left you alone to
die without even a book to read but
youve got to keep your mind clear in
case by some miracle you do survive

  and suddenly you realize how you
can tell how long its been and how
long there is to go you decided when
your mind was still clear enough for
you to decide things that youd divide
the food into thirty-nine even portions
and the water into thirty-nine even
portions and consume one portion of
each per day

  that had been a good idea for the
first two days but then youd forgotten
once to wind your watch and it had run
down and when you wound it you were
nervous and mad at yourself and al-
ready in almost more pain than you
could stand and you wound it too tight-
ly and broke the spring

  and now you havent any way of
telling time and you decided youd
adopt the system of eating only when
you were so hungry you couldnt stand
it any longer-and then never eating
more than half of a days food at one
time and water to match

 and you think-you hope-that
youve stuck to that even in the periods
when you were delirious and not sure
where you were or what you were do-
	startling stories

ing but how much food there is left
and how much water will be a clue at
least to how long its been

  you get off the cot and crawl-walk-
ing is too much of a waste of energy
even if you were strong enough to walk
-over to where the supply of food and
water is there are twenty portions of
each-the times almost half up and
its a good sign that the portions are
even if you ate and drank all you
wanted in delirium its not likely that
youd have consumed an even number
of portions of food and of water

  you look at them and decide you can
wait a little longer so you crawl back
to the cot you lie as quietly as you
can can you live another twenty days
youve got to

   there wras that flash into the mind of
camelon the leader it was accidental
some barrier slipped it happened just
after theyd shown you how helpless
you were and had released the para-
lysis

  some barrier slipped and you saw
not only the surface thoughts that he
was thinking but deep into his mind
it lasted how long a second perhaps
and then borl flashed a mental warn-
ing to camelon and a barrier suddenly
was there and only the surface
thoughts showed and the surface
thoughts were anger and chagrin at
himself for having been careless

ill

but a second had been long enough
the tharn were from the only planet
of a sol-type sun about nineteen light-
years from sol and almost due north
of sol-somewhere near the pole star
its intrinsic brightness was a little less
than that of our sun

  from those facts the approximate
distance approximate direction ap-
proximate brightness a little research
- a very little research-would show
what our name for that star was their
name for it was tharngel and the
tharn the inhabitants of tharngeps

one planet were looking for other
planets to which they could expand

  theyd found a few but not many
our sun had been a real find for them
because there were two planets suit-
able for their occupancy mars with a
little less air than they needed earth
with a little more but both factors
could be adjusted such planets-
planets with any oxygen atmosphere
at all-were extremely rare especial-
ly with sol-type suns and only in the
radiation of a sol-type sun could they
survive

  so they were returning to their own
planet to report and a fleet would come
to take over but it wouldnt arrive for
forty years their maximum drive was
a little under the speed of light and
they couldnt exceed that so the return
trip would take them twenty years-
then another twenty for their fleet to
come and take over

  nor had they lied about their only
weapons being mental ones their
ships were unarmed and they them-
selves had no hand weapons they
killed by thought individually they
could kill at short range in large
groups massing their minds into a col-
lective death-thought they could kill
many miles away

  you saw other things too in came-
lons mind everything theyd told you
had been true including the fact that
they couldnt lie could barely under-
stand the concept of a lie and gam-
bling was their only pleasure their
only weakness their only passion
their only code of honor was gambling
-aside from that they were as imper-
sonal as machines

  you even got a few- clues-a very few
-as to how that death-thought busi-
ness operated not enough to do it
yourself but-well if you had time
and expert help to work it out

  the help say of all the scientists-
the psychologists the psychiatrists
the anatomists-on earth a new sci-
ence just might be developed in forty
years with the few slight clues you
the gamblers



could give them and the knowledge
that there must be a defense and a
counter-offense-particularly a de-
feme if earth wasnt going to be a
tharn colony-earths best brains
ought to be able to do it in forty years

  they might at that a thought
camelons thought comes into your
mind but you wont be there to give
them those clues and tell them what
offensive weapon to fear or the dead-
line theyll have to meet

  theyll know something happened
if they find me dead here you think

  of course and as we are taking
along your books and apparatus for
study theyll know beings from outside
were here but they wont know our
plans our capabilities where we come
from they wont develop this defense
of which you were thinking

  better take no more chances with
him borl thinks at camelon

  right look at me bobthayer you
look at him and his eyes suddenly seem
to grow monstrous and you cant move
although it isnt the same type of para-

lysis as before and you suddenly real-
ize that you are being hypnotized
camelon thinks you can no longer
harm us physically in any way

  and you cant its as simple as that
you know you cant and thats that
they could all lie down on the floor
and go to sleep and you could have a
machine-gun in your hand and you
couldnt pull the trigger once

  camelon thinks at borl no chance
of his doing anything now that ive
done that we may yet learn more
things of value from him

  shall we choose the things we are to
take with us when dral returns with
the ship

  you gather that dral is one of them
and that he has gone somewhere in the
spaceship in which they came which
accounts for the fact that there was no
ship in sight when the relief landed
you wonder where dral has gone and
why probably to look over the bases
being started for the rockets to mars

can man defuse to die

  thirty-nine years ago in forbidden tibet be-
hind the highest mountains in the world a
young journalist named edwin j dingle found
the answer to this question a great mystic
opened his eyes a great change came over
him he realized the strange power that knowl-
edge gives

  that power he says can transform the life
of anyone questions whatever they are can be
answered the problems of health death pov-
erty and wrong can be solved

  in his own case he was brought back to
splendid health he acquired wealth too as well
as world-wide professional recognition thirty-
nine years ago he was sick as a man could be
and live once his coffin was bought years of
almost continuous tropical fevers broken bones
near blindness privation and danger had made
a human wreck of him physically and mentally

  he was about to be sent back home to die
when a strange message came - they are
waiting for you in tibet he wants to tell the
whole world what he learned there under the

guidance of the greatest mystic he ever encoun-
tered during his  years of travel throughout
the world he wants everyone to experience the
greater health and the power which there came
to him

  within ten years be was able to retire to this
country with a fortune he had been honored
by fellowships in the worlds leading geographi-
cal societies for his work as a geographer and
today  years later he is still so athletic capa-
ble of so much work so young in appearance it
is hard to believe he has lived so long

  as a first step in their progress toward the
power that knowledge gives mr dingle want
to send to readers of this paper a -word
treatise he says the time has come for it to be
released to the western world and offers to
send it free of cost or obligation to sincere

this dome a casual affirmative
thought from david gives you con-
firmation of your guess

  camelon is thinking to borl no
hurry he will not be back for hours
and it will not take us long we take
all books all apparatus nothing else

nnhere is a thought at the back of
a your mind and you try to keep it
there you try not to think about it
its not really a thought-its the
thought that there may possibly be a
thought if you dig for it and you dont
dare dig because theyll catch you at it
and know the thought as soon as you
do deliberately you think away from
it maybe your subconscious will work
out something from it without even you
recognizing the score

  its got something to do with their
love of gambling the fact that the only
honor they have has to do with gam-
bling think away from it quickly
none of them look your way-the
thought was too vague for them to
catch and it hasnt anything to do
with harming them-you know you
cant do that now

  you sit down and youre bored you
think about being bored so that if they
tune in on your mind thats what
theyll get and you really are bored-
thats the funny part of it youre wait-
ing for them to kill you but its going
to be hours yet and theres nothing you
can do about it-not even think about
it constructively

  you wish there were something to do
to fill in the time these guys like to
gamble dont they a poker game
maybe good old-fashioned poker
wonder if theyd be any good at it

  but how could you play poker with
people who could read your mind the
thought what is poker flashes at
you

  you answer simply by letting your-
self think of the rules of poker the
values of the hands the excitement of
the game and the thrill of running a
bluff and then sadly that it wouldnt

be possible for them to play it because
of their telepathic abilities

  as he thinks of it camelon borl
thinks it seems tremendously fascina-
ting why shouldnt we try it a new
gambling game would be a wonderful
thing to take back to tharngel-al-
most as good as the news of two habit-
able planets if the game is a success
and we can keep up our second-degree
barriers so that no thoughts can be sent
or received

  camelon-its risky with an alien
we know his capabilities and they
are slight youve put him under com-
pulsion not to harm us and at any
move of his we can lower the barriers
instantly

  camelon stares at you you try not
to think but you cant not think at all
so you concentrate on the fact that
there is a box of games equipment in a
certain locker that it includes cards
and chips it is there because occasion-
ally this dome has been occupied by
two or even three men if the research
project they were involved in was a
very brief one

  what about stakes camelon won-
ders among us we could use tharn
money your money if-no you have
none with you i perceive because you
thought it would be of no use to you
here-and anyway your money would
be useless to us ours to you

  you laugh youre going to take
my books and equipment anyway why
not win them if youre smart enough
you underlie it with the thought that
probably theyre too stupid to play
poker well and that theyd probably
cheat if they did play you feel the
waves of anger untranslatable because
they dont need translation-anger is
the same in any language maybe you
went too far

  get the cards camelon says and
you realize that he said it aloud in
english you wonder-and then real-
ize that youve been asking all your
questions by wondering and that this
one isnt being answered
the gamblers	

  you ask you speak english

  dont be stupid bobthayer of
course we can speak english after our
study of your mind and of course
we can speak-its simply such an in-
convenient method of communication
that we use it only under special cir-
cumstances such as this our barriers
are up-we can no longer read your
mind or you ours

  the big table serves borl is count-
ing out chipscamelon tells him to is-
sue you chips to the extent of a thou-
sand units on the books and equipment
you wonder how much a unit is and
whether youre being gypped or not but
nobody answers unasked questions
anymore

  maybe they arent kidding-maybe
the barriers are really up and will stay
up while the game is on come to think
of it they probably will poker wouldnt
be enjoyable otherwise just the same
you dont let yourself think too much
about anything important-such as
your subconscious reason for having
wanted this poker game they might be
testing you now even if they intend to
maintain their barriers while the game
is actually on while the chips are really
down

  you start to play you deal first to
show them how draw jacks to open
nobody gets openers and the deal passes
to borl you have to answer a few ques-
tions explain a few minor points out
loud in answer to spoken questions borl
is awkward handling the cards-you
wonder that a race of gamblers hasnt
discovered playing cards

  nobody explains borl deals and you
get queens you open borl and came-
lon stay you dont improve the queens
but you bet twenty units camelon has
drawn three cards and after borl drops
his hand camelon calls hes caught a
third trey to his original pair and he
wins the pot

  theyve got the idea all right-youd
better concentrate on playing good
poker you concentrate on it you have
to because theyre good and every in-

dication is that theyre on the level
playing square with you once with a
busted flush you push in a fifty-unit
bluff and you arent called although
david shows openers

once you spike an ace to a pair of
gentlemen and draw an ace and a
king for a full you bet a hundred and
borl calls you on a ten-high straight
the call almost breaks borl he buys
chips-and has to buy them from you
because all the chips in the rack have
been sold

  the stuff he buys them with turns out
to be two-inch-square bits of something
like cellophane except that its opaque
and has printing on it the printing is a
long way from being in english so you
cant read the denominations but you
take his word for it-his spoken word

  you hit a losing streak you lose all
your chips and have to use the currency
you got from borl to buy more from
camelon who has most of the chips by
now but you play cautiously for awhile
to learn their style-theyve developed
styles already theyre taking to poker
like cats to catnip

  borl is a bluffer-he always bets
more if he bets at all when he has noth-
ing than when he has a good hand ca-
melon plunges either way about every
fourth or fifth hand-the last two times
he had them and thats why hes got the
chips now david is cautious

  so are you for awhile then cards
begin to run your way and you bet them
you begin to pile up chips then cello-
phane units dari-the one who had
their spaceship-comes back theres a
momentary intermission while barriers
are lowered-and you carefully think
about nothing except the excitement of
the game as poker is explained to dari
telepath ically because its faster and
the boys are in a hurry to get back to
the game dari buys in

  he wine his first pot and hes an ad-
dict nobody cares what time it is or
whether school keeps

  pots run to a thousand units at a time
	startling stories

now- as many chips in one pot as you
got for all your books and equipment
but that doesnt matter because youve
got forty or fifty thousand units in front
of you dari goes broke first then borl
-after hes borrowed as much as came-
lon will lend him camelons tough and
david manages to pike along and stay
in

  but finally you do it youve got all
the money and you own one tham
spaceship to boot and the game is over
youve won

  or have you camelon gets up and
you look at him and remember-for the
first time in many hours-that he is an
alien

  we thank you bobthayer he
thinks at you the barriers are down
now we regret that we must kill you
for you have introduced us to a most
wonderful game

  in what are you going to leave you
think at him the spaceship is mine
until you are dead yes i fear we
shall inherit it from you then

  you forget not to talk i thought
you were gamblers you tell him all of
them aloud i thought you played for
keeps i thought you were honorable
when it came to gambling if nothing
else

  we are but-

  borl forgets and talks aloud too
hes right camelon we cannot take
the spaceship he won it fairly we
cannot-

  camelon said we must the life of
an individual is meaningless compared
to the advancement of the tharn we
will dishonor ourselves but we must re-
turn we must report these planets
then we shall kill ourselves as dis-
honored tharn

  you look at him in wonder and he
looks back and suddenly he lowers de-
liberately a barrier of his mind you
see that he means what he said they
are gamblers and theyve gambled and
lost and theyll take the consequences
theyll really kill themselves as dis-
honored-after theyve reported in

  a lot of good thats going to do you
youll be twenty years dead by the time
they get home and you wont have a
chance to tell earth what earths got to
know-what to get ready for in forty
years its a stalemate but that doesnt
help you or earth

iv

    ou think desperately looking for
an out youve won and theyve lost
but youve lost too-earth has lost you
dont care whether theyre reading your
mind or not you look desperately for
an answer even one that leaves you a
possibility maybe you can make a deal

  no camelon thinks at you it is
true that if you offered us back our ship
our money the books and equipment in
exchange for your own life-which was
already forfeit-we could return honor-
ably to our people but you would warn
earth as you were thinking some
hours ago a defense might be developed
by your scientists so we would be
traitors to our own race if we made such
a deal with you even to save our own in-
dividual honors

  you look at them one at a time at
them physically and into a part of their
minds and you see that they mean it
all of them they agree with their lead-
er and they mean it

  dari thinks camelon we must
leave we go to our deaths but we must
leave kill him quickly and let us com-
plete our dishonor

  camelon turns to you

  wait you say desperately aloud
i thought you were gamblers if you
were gamblers youd give me a chance
no matter how slim a chance youd
leave me here with one chance out of
ten to survive and in exchange for that
chance ill give you your own posses-
sions back voluntarily and min too
that way you wouldnt be stealiirrthem
back-you wouldnt be dishonoi-ed you
wouldnt have to kill yourselves after
you reported

its a new idea they look at you
the gamblers	

then one by one they think negatives

  one chance in a hundred you say
theres no change one chance in a
thousand i thought you were gam-
blers

  camelon thinks you tempt us ex-
cept for one thing if we leave you here
alive you can leave a message for those
who are due in thirty-nine days to pick
you up even though you yourself do
not survive to meet them

  youd been hoping for that but theyd
read your mind damn beings who can
read minds still any chance at all is
better than nothing you say take
away all writing materials

  borl thinks at camelon we can do
better than that put a psychic block on
his ability to write a chance in a thou-
sand is little camelon to save our
honor as he says we are gamblers
cant we gamble that far

  camelon looks at david at dari he
turns to you and raises his hand you
lose consciousness

  you awaken suddenly and completely
the lights are dim the inside of the
dome looks different you look around
and realize that it has been stripped of
most of the things that were there and
there is only one tharn in the room with
you-camelon you find you are lying
on the cot and you sit up and look at
him

  he thinks at you we are giving you
one chance in a thousand bobthayer
we have calculated it carefully every-
thing is arranged i will explain the cir-
cumstances and the odds

  go ahead you say

  we have left you enough food
enough water-barely enough to sur-
vive it is true but you will not die of
hunger or thirst if you ration them care-
fully we have studied your metabolism
with great care we know your exact
limits of tolerance we have as borl
suggested also blocked your ability to
write so that you can leave no message
that of course has nothing to do with
your one chance out of a thousand of
survival

  wheres the catch whats the
chance then if you leave me enough
food and enough water oxygen

  thats right we have taken out your
oxygen system and are leaving one of
our own type it is much simpler see
those thirteen plastic containers on the
table each one contains enough liquid
oxygen to supply you-by very careful
calculation-with enough oxygen to last
you three days if you are extremely
careful and take no exercise whatever

  the oxygen is in a binder fluid that
keeps it liquid and lets it evaporate at
a constant and exact rate the binder
fluid also absorbs waste products you
need open one jar every three days-or
whenever you find yourself in need of
more oxygen than you are getting which
will be within a matter of minutes of
three days

tut wheres the catch you wonder
 thirteen containers each good for
three days if youre careful add up to
thirty-nine

  you dont have to ask it aloud came-
lon thinks one of the containers is
poisoned there is an odorless undetect-
able gas that will evaporate with tht
oxygen it is sufficiently poisonous tc
kill ten men of your weight and resist-
ance of your general metabolism there
is no way to tell it from the other jars
without extremely special equipment
and chemical knowledge beyond yours
the day you open that container you
die

  fine you say but how does that
give me a chance if i have to use all
thirteen containers in order to live
through

  there is a slight possibility-one
which we have calculated very carefully
-that you can survive on twelve con-
tainers of oxygen if you can and if you
choose the proper twelve-which you
have one chance out of thirteen of doing
-you will survive the parley of the
two chances adds up to one chance out
of a thousand we leave now my com-
panions await me in our ship
	startling stories

  he doesnt wish you good-bye and you
dont wish him good-bye either you
watch the inner door of the airlock close

  you go over and look at the thirteen
containers of oxygen and they all look
alike the air is very thin and hard to
breathe youre going to have to open
one of them quite soon the wrong one
the one than contains enough poison to
kill ten men

  maybe it would be better if you pick
the wrong one first and get it over with
the poison is odorless and undetectable
-maybe its painless too you wish
youd wondered that while he was still
here hed have answered it for you
probably it is painless-or is that only
wishful thinking

  you look around the rest of the place
they havent left a thing of value ex-
cept those thirteen containers and the
food and water it doesnt look like much
food and water for that long a period
but it probably is enough barely if you
ration it carefully probably they feared
if they left any surplus water you might
figure some way to get the oxygen out
of it they were wrong on that but they
didnt take any chances-except the
thousand-to-one chance

  youre panting breathing like an
asthmatic you reach for a container to
open it if you do theres one chance
out of thirteen that youll be dead in
hours maybe in minutes they didnt
tell you either how fast-acting the poison
is

  you pull your hand back you dont
want to take even one chance out of
thirteen of dying until youve had a
chance to think carefully you go back
to the cot and lie down to think because
you remember that every muscular mo-
tion you make cuts your chances

  have they missed anything anything
at all the oxygen tank on back of your
space-suit you sit up suddenly and look
and see that the space-suit itself is gone
theres no advantage to the airlock-
the air that enters it when you pull the
lever comes from this room and the
lock is empty now since it was last used

for a departure

  the hydroponic garden is gone so
are the emergency tanks of oxygen that
were in the storeroom in case of failure
of the plants you realize that youve
got up and are wandering around again
and you sit down you cut your chances
with every step you take

  one chance in a thousand-if you can
use only twelve containers of oxygen
theres-you figure it out mentally-
there must be one chance in about
seventy-seven that youll live thats
what they must have figured one
chance in seventy-seven parlayed
against one in thirteen i about one in
a thousand

  but if you could use all thirteen con-
tainers your chances would be good
better than even not quite a certainty
because there is always the possibility
that something would go wrong such
as your losing your will power on ra-
tioning the food-or more likely the
water-and dying of hunger or thirst
in the last day or two

  you look for something to write with
to see if they made any mistake on the
hypnotic block you cant find anything
but you find out it doesnt matter
youve got a finger havent you you
try to write your name on the wall with
your finger you cant you know your
name all right-bob thayer but you
havent the faintest idea how to write it

  you could talk the message if you
had a recording machine but you
havent a recording machine or any ma-
terials which by any stretch of the
imagination would let you make one
youve got only your brain you sit
down and use it

vou forget to wind your watch and
then because of the pain you wind
it too tight and break or jam the spring
and youve lost track of time and then
comes the time when you find that half
of your supplies are gone and youiiope
that half of the thirty-nine days is gone
too

  and then again youre sick and deliri-
the gamblers	

ous and part of the time you think youre
back on earth and that youve just had
a nightmare about creatures from a
place called tharngel and you dreamed
within the nightmare that you were
playing poker on the moon and that you
won

  pain thirst hunger struggle for
breath nightmare and then one day
you eat the last of the food and drink
the last of the water and you wonder
whether its the thirty-first day or the
thirty-ninth and you lie down again and
wait to find out

  and you sleep and in your dream you
hear an earthshaking racket that could
be the landing of the relief except that
you know youre dreaming and in your
dream the air gets even thinner as air
rushes from the dome into the airlock
and the airlock opens and captain
thorkelsen is standing there beside you
and you say hi captain weakly and
wake up to find out that you werent
really asleep and then you black out

  and when you come around again
there is good breatheable air in the dome
and there is food waiting for you to eat-
and water waiting for you to drink and
all four of them from the relief are
standing around watching you anxious-
ly

  thorkelsen grins down at you what
have you been doing where are all
the books and equipment what hap-
pened

  got in a poker game you tell him
your throat is dry still almost too dry
to talk but you drink some water-care-
fully a sip at a time

  and then youre telling the story a
bit at a time as you sip more water and
eat a little and you begin to feel almost
human again

  and from the way they listen and the
way they watch you you know that they
believe it-that theyd believe you even
if it werent for the evidence around
them and that earth will believe and
that everythings all right that forty
years is a long time even to develop a
new science when all of earth is work-

ing at it and youve still got the clues
to give them a start and your gamble
paid off you won the poker game after
all

  you get tired after a while and have
to stop talking thorkelsen looks at you
wonderingly he says but good lord
man how did you do it all those oxy-
gen containers-if thats what they were
-are plumb empty and you say enough
poison to kill ten men was in one of
them you look like youve lost thirty
pounds weight and you look like youll
need a months rest before you can walk
again but youre alive did they miscal-
culate or what

  you cant keep your eyes open any
longer-youve got to sleep but maybe
you can take time to explain

  simple cap you tell him each
container held enough oxygen for one
man for three days and one of them also
contained enough poison to kill ten men
but there were thirteen containers so
i opened them all and mixed them to-
gether and then put them back and
opened one approximately every three
days so every minute from the open-
ing of the first one theres been ten-
thirteenths of enough poison in the air
to kill a man for thirty-nine days ive
been breathing almost enough poison to
kill me

  of course the effect could have been
cumulative and it could have killed me
anyway but on the other hand i might
have built up immunity toward it
didnt seem to work either way-ive
just been sick from it at a constant de-
gree from the beginning but it was
plenty better than the one chance in a
thousand they intended to give me so
i tried it and it worked

  vaguely youre aware that thorkelsen
is saying something but you cant make
out what it is and you dont care because
youre practically asleep already the
wonderful sleep that you can have only
when youre breathing real air with
enough oxygen and no poison youre
going to sleep all the way back to earth
and never leave earth again ever 
 couples for the colonization of
cygnus were chosen
scientifically - but love
sometimes laughs at sciencei

a tecond beait joined the flrrt
and makin had to keep hli eye
on them both

the cupids of venus

by william morrison

as the men filed into the lecture room
out of the fog makin looked
around but there was no sign that any
of the women had been here in fact
there was nothing to indicate that the
women were on the same planet his
heart dropped but he hid his disappoint-
ment as colonel galchek strode into
the room he assumed the same cool
look of indifference the others showed

  the colonel stared at them and the

men quieted down the colonel had an
idea thought makin ironically that he
knew how to impose discipline with a
glance but it was more probable that
on this last lap of their training before
the great adventure the men were
anxious to learn what lay ahead of them
at any rate they listened attentively

  colonel galchek was brief gentle-
men he said your stay on venus will
be a short one-less than ten days you


the cupids of venus	

will be forced to undergo in this brief
period hazards of the same kind you
would normally face on cygnus beta
two in the course of years i need hardly
say that this sort of training will be
invaluable it is possible-even prob-
able-that of the sixty men here one
or two will not survive the rigors of the
course he looked at them coolly as if
wondering which one or two would not
survive we shall regret all casualties
of course

  the dirty liar thought makin he
wouldnt regret a casualty if it was his
own grandmother

  nevertheless some casualties are un-
avoidable and it is far better to suffer
them here where you can reveal your
weaknesses while there is still time to
correct them than on a planet in
cygnus we dont want any unpleasant
surprises there of the fifty couples
finally selected to make the trip we
intend to have every one survive we
want the cygnus colony to get off to a
good start we must prove that its liva-
ble and that it can take the overflow of
the systems population

he paused as the men stirred rest-
lessly

  youre picked men and youve already
been through severe training your
wives have been selected just as care-
fully as you have they will be fit mates
for you in every respect

  are the women asked makin un-
dergoing the same sort of training in
the final stage 

  naturally on cygnus theyll face the
same conditions as you do theyll need
the same preparation

  are they on venus too 

  the colonel frowned they are but
that doesnt concern you you will have
no contact with them until the time for
departure i should like to suggest gen-
tlemen he added acidly that you con-
fine your questions to matters that con-
cern this group as a whole individual
problems will be taken up during your

interviews this afternoon and to-
morrow

  the men shrugged one man opened
his mouth to ask a question and then
closed it the question unasked

  youll receive your detailed sched-
ules tomorrow afternoon after you have
all been interviewed that is all

  the men broke up and went to their
rooms makin was not tired but he could
have slept if he had wanted to for he
had conditioned himself to fall into a
sound slumber upon the mental repeti-
tion of a simple nursery rhyme and
from all indications it would be well to
rest up as much as possible for the or-
deal ahead of him all the same he pre-
ferred to stay awake and think

  he had met the girl he knew as
womens group member  or w  for
short accidentally a mere two weeks
before on completion of his space
flight she had been sent in to see her
own superior officer at the time he had
gone up for a psychological recheck
the elevator signal had been set for the
wrong floor and he had met her in
the waiting room

  he had known even at the time that
it was hopeless for the matings were
being arranged on a scientific basis but
he had fallen in love with her completely
even in a manner of speaking before
first sight he had fallen in love with
the shape of the back of her head of
her neck and shoulders before she had
turned her head so that he could see
her face the sight of her clear eyes and
the strong yet delicate chin had merely
strengthened his feelings he had been
able to say only a dozen words to her
before an attendant had discovered that
he was in the wrong place and firmly
escorted him out but in that time he
had heard her voice and the sound was
part of his own existence he was in
love and he would have one chance in
sixty of getting her

  the chance had been long but not
impossible unfortunately it had not
come through he had been informed
	startling stories

only the day before that he had been
paired with w- and that no change
in arrangements was possible

  the men in charge were not idiots but
they could be guilty on occasion of idiotic
behavior he would have died for w 
and he was being assigned to w  some
man who wouldnt have crossed the
street to save her life was going to get
the girl he loved and to live with her
for the rest of her life it was stupid it
would inevitably cause trouble in the new
colony but the men in charge were not
concerned with his feelings they had
their rules and they were going to see
to it that they were carried out

  makin cursed softly to himself he had
volunteered for colonization duty of his
own accord out of a spirit of adventure
and he had up till then accepted disci-
pline with the belief that it was for his
own good now he refused to accept it
further he hoped they wouldnt force
him to do it but if necessary he would
drop out of the colony they wouldnt
like it but it wouldnt really hurt their
plans for of the sixty men they had cer-
tainly calculated on losing one or two
whatever happened however he was
going to get that girl

  having made up his mind about that
he said to himself the little birds upon
the moon are sad as sad can be there
is no air and thats unfair to bird or
bug or bee with the last word he was
asleep

  his interview with the colonel took
place the following morning and it set-
tled things for him the colonel said
you were interested in the womens
group mr makin is one of them on your
mind

  very much so i want to marry her

  you are not satisfied with the mate
assigned to you

  i havent met her and i dont know
anything about her i dont want to
know

  her number i understand is w 
i have her photograph here you might
care to look at it

  makin looked and said shes a pret-
ty girl under other circumstances i
might have liked her

  she has excellent qualities qualities
any man would like to see in his wife
sorry colonel im not interested i
want to marry w 

  this one

  again the colonel showed a photo-
graph and suddenly makin was con-
scious that his heart beat faster
thats the one sir

  shes been assigned to someone
else

  i think shes in love with me too
love the words absurd youll both
of you change your minds before long
i dont think we will

the colonel said testily your psy-
chological pattern shows that you
are best suited to w  we know whats
best for you makin

  psychology is not yet an exact sci-
ence colonel i prefer the girl of my own
choice

  you will take the one we choose for
you and incidentally makin there is
no backing out you understand that i
think unless you fail to pass the tests
in which case your future is not very
bright you will be a member of the
colonizing expedition and you will be
married to w  before leaving

  do you think that is wise sir  i tell
you frankly that i am in love with
w  and if she is to be married to
another man in the same colony of fifty
couples-

  we have thought of that makin
the colonel smiled pleasantly i may
have neglected to tell you that there will
be not one colony in cygnus but two
another group of fifty couples will be
going to cygnus sigma three at the
end of this present training period you
and your mate will be shipped to one
colony w  and her mate to the other
there will be no transport between them
you and w  will never see each other
again
the cupids of venus	

  i understand sir said makin quiet-
ly he saluted and went out leaving the
colonel still smiling behind him

  down the corridor he received his
training schedule and had time to study
it they were starting the men off on
individual jungle trips each man would
be supplied with a map and instruments
with enough food for a week and with
weapons that would enable him if he
were sufficiently strong and active to
cope with the fauna and flora he might
be expected to encounter

  he pored over the map and drew cer-
tain conclusions that were not in line
with the task that had been assigned
him he was expected to travel from
point a to point b in seven days the
distance was short no more than a
hundred miles as the venusian equiva-
lent of a crow flew but detours might be
necessary and the map covered far more
than a narrow strip of territory between
the two points

  if the women were undergoing the
same kind of training it was possible
that they were being sent through the
same jungle in an area alongside their
starting point might be expected to be
not too far away and if he moved rapid-
ly not from a to b but to the side he
might get on her trail

  the only question to be decided was in
which direction to move right or left
he studied the map again and noted
that the jungle at the right was a little
less dense in consideration of the lesser
physical strength of the women it was
possible although far from certain that
they had been given the easier route

  makin made up his mind he would
move to the right and try to locate her
as rapidly as possible if he made a
mistake he would be losing much valu-
able time and be forced to retrace his
steps but there was no other course
open to him

  he set off at once to the right the
sun glared down its disc vague and
enormous through a thick lens of semi-
transparent clouds its rays hot and ac-

tive some of the bluish vegetation in
his path could actually be seen to grow
as he looked at it but the stalks bent
away from him as he approached re-
pelled by the st in which his clothes and
equipment had been soaked

  overhead great bird-lie insects
soared one or two of them caught sight
of him swooped down and then zoomed
upward in sudden fright as a sound ray
from his ultra-frequency projector hit
them

  within the first half-hour he came
across a colony of the much-feared
traveling fungi which his guide book
assured him were relatively rare the
entire colony began to crawl toward him
when he was still a hundred feet away
and he had to destroy its cohesion with
an aerosol pellet a faintly sweetish odor
filled the air and the colony broke up
into countless numbers of individual
fungi each growing and dividing grow-
ing and dividing aimlessly to end up
an hour after he had gone as enfeebled
and dying individuals no longer capable
of joining together as a super-organism
which had been the terror of the animals
in his path

  he didnt turn back to look five
hours after the start he stopped to eat
and rest the eating took ten minutes
the resting five by the beam compass
and path tracer on his left wrist which
gave him his position at a glance he
saw that he had covered almost twelve
miles the going was not rapid but he
was untired and he knew that he could
keep it up for a long time he moved on

  the clouds began to thicken and the
jungle became dank and gloomy a vast
dismal cavern beneath the heavy arch
of vapor twice he saw other men of his
group and they passed each other quick-
ly with the shortest of greetings each
intent upon his own problem

  now if his guess was correct he must
be coming close to the area where the
women would be forcing their way
through the jungle the vegetation was
already more sparse and occasionally he
	startling stories

could catch a glimpse of a large form
slinking silently in the distance past the
moving trunks of trees which snapped
desperately at it in an attempt to secure
much-needed protein

  he turned on the walkie-talkie on his
right wrist and broadcast a signal if he
were lucky she would be close enough
to hear him and reply but no one
answered he continued to signal from
time to time for short intervals but it
was another six hours before he re-
ceived a signal in return w  wanted
to know whether he was hurt and calling
for help

  he told her that he wasnt and asked
if she could give him any information
about w  she couldnt and he
switched off once more changing direc-
tion so that he would cut across w s
path without meeting her the incident
was a definite bit of encouragement it
showed that he had chosen the correct
direction for the womens test area and
that in cutting across to the right he had
not dropped far enough behind to be out
of contact distance

  he had stored up enough sleep to keep
going for a good twenty-four hours with-
out getting too tired but he did not
omit necessary precautions he stopped
to eat again after the normal five-hour
period and this time he rested for twen-
ty minutes

when he started again night had
fallen but he strode ahead as con-
fidently as before a beam from his cap
casting a daylight glow around him and
at the end of the third hour he received
in response to his own signal the word
he had awaited

  w  said softly ive been expecting
to hear from you

  you cut across to the left to meet
me

  as fast as i could

  whats your position now

  she told him and he looked at the map
and clenched his teeth between them
ran a river a mile in width near the

center it was several hundred feet in
depth there were deadly water-crea-
tures hidden beneath its surface and
there was no ford where a crossing could
be attempted nor would it be feasible
to build a raft the large vegetation was
heavier than water and could not be
cut down and hollowed out so that it
would float except at the cost of more
time than they could spare

  nevertheless they were within talk-
ing distance of one another and that
was the main thing an hour later they
were at the river he on his bank and
she on hers but his beam would not
cut through a mile of darkness and he
knew that he would have to wait for
daylight before catching sight of her

  colonel galchek would have enjoyed
their conversation makin asked gently
are you tired darling

  not very

  you should go to sleep but id like
to give myself five minutes of talking
to you

  is that all

  that will keep me going until morn-
ing whats your real name

  lona darling are your eyes really
green or was it just the light in which i
saw you

  theyre supposed to be greenish-
blue

  i love them darling let me hear
you say my name

  the conversation as colonel galchek
might have observed derisively de-
generated into an interchange of fairly
senseless but satisfying sounds but
makin limited himself strictly to five
minutes at the end of that time they
wished each other good night and each
retired to a clear spot in the middle of
a clump of trees

  the fronds recoiled desperately from
their std clothing and thrashed around
in impotent anger any of the larger
animals lured by hopes of a human meal
would receive a ferocious welcome from
these vegetable guardians

  makin varied his rhyme slightly using
the cupids of venus	

the version that would insure awakening
at the end of six hours

  he whispered softly the little crea-
tures on the moon are sad as sad can
be there is no air and thats unfair
to things that fly or flee

  his sleep was as sound as ever but
it did not last for a full six hours short-
ly before the awakening time he had set
for himself a shrill howling from the
trees around him brought him to his
feet a long thin constrictor plant had
wrapped itself around the fronds of one
of his tree-guards and the tree was
whipping back and forth in a vain effort
to escape the other end of the con-
strictor slipped through the space be-
tween the trees and came at him

  his knife was out at once and he
slashed at it vigorously but the supple
bark had the toughness of steel and even
the tempered blade left no more than a
shallow scratch the constrictor curled
around his right arm and from that as
he dropped the knife slid to his body
but his other hand had already secured
his heater and the blinding flame sliced
through the thin strangler with star-
tling ease

  the two halves of the constrictor
dropped from their victims and slithered
away in panic soon the charred ends
would slough away and then if the
plant-creature were lucky and didnt die
at once they would embed themselves
in the soil and slowly grow again

  meanwhile makin rubbed his right
arm which felt paralyzed and left the
clump of trees he turned on his walkie-
talkie and at once received her signal

  darling she said i got up early to
think about you but i didnt want to dis-
turb your sleep are you all right
perfect he told her but dont do
it again you need the rest more than i
need the time spent worrying about me
the mists are clearing shall we try
to see each other

  he stood at the edge of the river and
looked across on the other edge he
could make out a small black spot which

seemed to move oddly

  are you waving your arms he
asked

  thats right you have wonderful
eyes

  just what  was going to say but
your face doesnt look as beautiful as it
did the last time i saw you not at this
distance

  why not use your field magnifier
im getting it out he focussed the
lenses and grinned are you angry at
me or is that expression natural

  its perfectly natural im sticking
my tongue out at you

  because i cant think of a way to
cross this river

  not at all just because i love you
thats hardly logical he said but
it makes sense to me what do we do
next

  continue upstream on our way to
the designated points

  not quite besides thats no solu-
tion to crossing the river it doesnt
narrow appreciably for fifty miles
what are a mere fifty miles
darling he said dont talk like
that or ill plunge in and try to swim
across and im saving that little trick
for a last resort shall we start up-
stream keeping each other in sight and
see what we can find in the way of
ferries

  we may as well she sighed

in the river a creature that seemed to
be all mouth and teeth broke the sur-
face and turned toward him it had no
eyes but it scented his presence as
urely as any hound could have done
as he moved upstream it kept pace with
him like a faithful dog after a mile
another of its kind joined it and then
another and another a few words from
lona confirmed the fact that she was
being accompanied by a similar pack
of hungry and hopeful river-beasts his
chances of crossing the river and join-
ing her began to seem more remote than
ever
	startling stories

  after eighteen hours of travel they
slept as before in the center of groups
of trees and this time no incident dis-
turbed the sleep of either one but next
morning the hungry packs were still
there faithfully awaiting what must
have seemed to them like promised
meals

  that day and the following passed
eventlessly and hopelessly for a few
moments makin had entertained the
idea of cutting down one of the larger
trees and hollowing it out to make a
canoe but even if he had taken the
time he realized that the craft would
have been unstable and that the wait-
ing beasts would easily have tipped it
over to get at him

  on the fourth day of their journey
along the river the jungle began to thin
out here and there were spaces bare
of the frond-trees and in these clearings
more and more of the larger animals
began to be visible two or three at-
tached themselves to his trail and he
could see them from time to time fear-
ful of the weapons that they knew
human beings carried but hopeful at
the same time of a human meal for the
moment they were no more than shad-
owy dangers but sooner or later they
would attack

  a short conversation with lona re-
vealed that she too was accompanied by
similar companions on land as well as
by the river-pack

  take care of yourself said makin
casually although his heart beat faster
when he heard of her danger

  dont worry sweetheart

  the river narrows a bit just a little
further on tomorrow im going to at-
tempt a crossing

  youll try to swim

  yes ive thought of a way it isnt
foolproof but i think i have a very good
chance

  you mustnt what will become of
me if i lose you 

  i dont think you will but dont
worry darling well talk it over

thoroughly before i start out

  the jungle thinned out until it was no
longer jungle and that night he had
difficulty in finding a clump of trees to
protect him he was glad to hear that on
her side she had less trouble when
eventually he fell asleep the beasts
crouched outside the range of the trees
panting expectantly at the thought of
what would happen on the morrow

 in the morning he spoke to lona
again and made ready this time when
he left the protection of the trees the
hungry animals could hardly wait they
darted around him each afraid to be
the first to attack each fearfully watch-
ing its fellows to make sure that it was
not done out of a meal

  he made straight for the river bank
at sight of him apparently ready to en-
ter the water and escape them the
hitherto soundless animals howled in
desperation while in the water the
mouth-like beasts quivered with eager-
ness

  the land-beasts attacked but makin
had his weapon out and although they
darted in swiftly his gun was ready he
cut down four before they came close
and a fifth whose teeth were slashing
at him the animal died in mid-air its
jaws snapping and tearing at the skin
of his arm before it hit the ground

  two remained alive and these fled he
turned his back to them and directed
his gun upon the waiting river-beasts
when he had finished his slaughter
dead creatures floated on the water for
a distance of a hundred feet down the
river

  he tossed into the water the first ani-
mals he had killed and ran upstream
at a spot where the scent of the dead
had not yet reached he plunged in for
a few moments at least he would be
safe with the attention of the rivers
predatory creatures centered on the
feast he had so kindly provided for them

  he swam rapidly and steadily at a
pace the he knew he could keep up from
the other side of the river lona was
keeping an eye on him ready to warn
the cupids of venus	

him of danger that approached on the
surface after a quarter of a mile her
signal came the animals he had killed
had been eaten and the different preda-
tors especially those who had managed
to get no more than a taste of the feast
would be seeking new victims he
crushed one of his two capsules of river-
repellent as it rested in a pocket of his
jacket

  he was barely in time from the ide
one of the mouth-like beasts darted at
him then stopped short trembling with
a sort of animal disgust as it caught the
scent-taste of the repellent diffusing
slowly from his jacket into the water
to makin himself the chemical had a
faint not unpleasant fragrance but to
the river creatures it was intolerable
this one darted away again as rapidly
as it had approached

  but it didnt go far it returned once
more slowly this time and followed him
as he swam steadily toward the bank
where lona waited he tried to twist
around for a shot at it but in the water
the animal was too quick for him and
all he did was waste precious seconds
in which he could have advanced almost
a dozen yards he didnt make the same
mistake again

he swam steadily until the increas-
ing boldness of the waiting beast
warned him that the supply of chemical
in the capsule was near exhaustion
none the less he kept his nerve before
crushing his second and final capsule
he waited until the creature was actually
darting in for the attack

  it swerved away again but it had won
a partial victory makin had hoped he
would not have to use this second dose
of repellent before covering two-thirds
of the distance across the river but he
had been forced to crush the capsule at
least fifty yards before this goal now
he knew that he would have to fight his
way the last hundred yards out of the
river and he could gauge his hopes of
success by the quickness of the waiting
beast which circled around him easily

and could flash in for the kill while he
tried to twist around and raise his
weapon

  his hopes were not improved at the
three-quarter mark where a second
beast joined the first and he knew that
when the moment for fighting came he
would have to keep an eye on both at
the same time

  he had passed the deepest part of the
river and a hundred yards from shore
he was able to touch bottom but he
continued to swim for he could advance
more rapidly that way than he could by
wading only when both beasts as if at
a signal closed in at the same time did
he stand and make the desperate fight
that he had known was inevitable

   his first shot missed and one beasts
mouth loomed before him the teeth
sharp and frightening he swung an arm
in front of his face to keep the jaws
from snapping at his throat and the
teeth ripped his sleeve to shreds he
had no time for the creature that would
attack from the other side and in the
back of his mind he felt that he was
doomed

  but it was not in his nature to give
up as the one in front of him twisted
around and snapped again he thrust his
arm into its mouth and fired the blast
tore it apart as the teeth sank into his
flesh

  he turned around at his side the
other beast floated dead and lona was
trying not to sob

   darling i came as quickly as i could
but i was too slow youre wounded 

   not badly not too badly to do this

  he put both the injured and the un-
harmed arm around her and drew her
close for a second she allowed him to
embrace her then pushed him away

   lets get to the bank first

  he said unhappily i suppose thats
sensible what slowed you up

  the moment i saw you were having
trouble i came to meet you as i had
said i would before you entered the
water but my first capsule was faulty
the chemical in it seemed to have de-
	startling stories

teriorated and the beasts came at me
when i was no further in than my knees
luckily i could use my arm freely
enough to fight them off then i used
the other capsule and came on but i
had lost time a second later and i
wouldnt have been able to get the one
coming at you from the other side

she shuddered but makin said calm-
ly you werent too late i knew all
along that you wouldnt be

  they had reached shore and this time
the embrace was a long one

  finally she pulled her lips away from
his and gasped were not out of the
woods yet let me bandage your arm
the better to embrace you with
let me do the talking darling we
still have a wonderful chance to get to
cygnus

  together

 she nodded the man who inter-
viewed me was called out of the room
he was out for five minutes long enough
for me to read one or two of the papers
on top of his desk and learn the pro-
cedure to be followed on the cygnus
colonizing expedition we can get on
that space ship and once were on theyll
have to take us

 makin smiled you were unscru-
pulous enough to meddle with papers
that you had no right to touch despite
the code youve been taught and the
penalties with which youve been threat-
ened

  darling i knew they meant to keep
us apart i wasnt going to let that hap-
pen no matter what the risk

  lona youre wonderful-

  no dont kiss me again just listen
the space port is twenty miles from
here they dont expect trouble so it
isnt too well guarded we can get mar-
ried in the civilian center nearby using
the papers given us for the official
mating then if we can get on the ship
shortly before its scheduled to take off
they wont have time to find out that
anythings wrong and once it does take
off it certainly wont turn back for our

sake the only difficulty will be getting
on the ship

  well bribe a guard

 the guards may not be easy to
bribe

  then well threaten them or well
do both lets go darling

  at the civilian center each had a
marriage test-certificate ready and the
ceremony took place without trouble
but at the space port itself there seemed
at first little chance that they would be
able to get to the ship

  the first guard to whom makin spoke
in private refused bluntly and was
about to raise an alarm when makin hit
him and knocked him unconscious plas-
tic ropes and a gag ensured his silence
until take-off time

  with the second guard a shifty-eyed
individual who kept his gaze on the
ground they had more luck he demand-
ed all their money and their most valu-
able equipment before consenting to aid
them but finally he was satisfied

  the actual getting on the ship turned
out to be simple enough the guard con-
sulted a register of those already checked
through accepted their identification
tags pretended to compare the numbers
with those on his lists and waved them
forward he would get into trouble later
thought makin but the bribe he had re-
ceived would more than make up for it

  a half-hour after they had been given
their compartment the ship took off
but not until it had circled the planet
and was setting a steady course for
cygnus did they breathe freely then
makin to k her in his arms once more
they were hurtling past earth by the
time he let her go

in the colonization office major crane
saluted and colonel galchek said
dryly

  whats the final record

  fifty-one couples for beta two fifty-
two for sigma three all on board in
first-class condition or close to it noth-
ing but such trifles as wounded arms and
legs wrenched backs and so on
the cupids of venus

  weve topped our quota said gal-
chek with satisfaction next time well
do even better what were the causes
of failure

  of the seventeen listed there was
one joint failure in which neither man
nor woman made the grade both physi-
cal and mental factors were involved
galchek grunted separate them cure
them of what ails them and give them
nice non-adventurous jobs go on
three cases of physical failure-two
among the men one among the women
purely accidental factors involved they
refused to be separated in each case
the uninjured member of the couple
saved his or her partner i suggest that
they be kept together and sent on a later
expedition

  well do that what of the remaining
thirteen 

  primarily mental there was slight
differences among them but in each
case the pre-encounter suggestions did
not work out properly

  whose fault asked galchek the
psychologists 

  theyre not perfect colonel but i
think we can blame primarily the
human material consider the cases that
did work such as those of m  and
w 

  i remember m  i think his name
was makin

  right he and w  received
thoroughly established pre-suggestions
that they fall in love with each other
despite the nature of pretended official
matings well all he needed was a sight
of the back of her neck her hair and
half of one ear and the thing clicked
from then on wild horses couldnt have
separated them in fact wild beasts
didnt

  and in the other cases-the fail-
ures 

  some had even more protracted first
meetings undoubtedly they felt at-
tracted to each other but five were so
thoroughly conditioned to taking orders



that they refused to challenge the official
matings they would have allowed them-
selves to be mated to those they didnt
like rather than risk displeasure for
those they loved

  galchek said with contempt theyll
make nice officials themselves some day
old bureaucratic style theyll be sepa-
rated

  of course of those left two of the
women were so honorable that they re-
fused to examine the papers on my desk
when given the opportunity three of
the men after going through all the
physical dangers thought it was wrong
to bribe a guard even that shifty-eyed
guard we had placed there for the spe-
cific purpose of being bribed

the idiots theyd never make the
grade on cygnus and the remainder
danger separated them instead of
bringing them together they quarreled
fiercely

  for them cygnus would be death
galchek said talking about psycholo-
gists not being perfect-theyre hardly
passable every individual had a
thorough psych-check none of these
things should have happened

  we know they shouldnt but they
always do thats why we cant afford to
rely on tests alone and have to put our
couples through the mill

  i still say its wasteful growled
galchek of course the fact that each
couple has fought through dangers to-
gether and expects to receive punish-
ment for breaking orders if it ever re-
turned to the system also helps keep
them together on a tough job in cygnu
but the whole thing is a nuisance im-
agine the colonization service having to
serve as cupid and arrange all those love
matches

  and the thought of makin and lona
and all the other couples now gazing so
blissfully into each others eyes made
him growl again for it happened that
colonel galchek chief cupid of venus
had married for money instead of love

  see what i mean

which mag has the tony

by w paul ganley sec isfcc

dear mr merwin

  it has been quite a long interval since i last sat
down to bat out an epistle to a fantasy magazine
perhaps it only seems long but honestly when i
liave the inclination i have no time and with
sufficient time there is little desire i suspect i
shant regain the old bubbling enthusiasm with
which i put together a bundle of fiendish phrases
and sent them on their way through the medium
of a completely innocent mail carrier

  nevertheless i have returned whether for this
month alone or for a longer stay only time can tell
however i got startling this afternoon and
decided to do nothing tonight but read it comment
on it and listen to the buffalo bisons get beaten
again the reason for this momentous decision
other than laziness is to relax my mind to some
extent-for on the morrow i have a scholarship
exam at the university of buffalo starting next
september ill have even less time to devote to my
favorite literature

  a goodly percentage of letters begin when they
dont start off this is my very first letter to  
etc etc by saying havent written often of
late but this current issue of ss featured such
a terrific novel that i just had to sit down and 
and so on

  well its not true the dark tower was
not an outstanding novel-but jt was good it was
completely relaxing some people dislike space
opera but i dont dislike it when its well handled
and as you yourself said west did an excellent job

  brackett was pretty good yknow bracketts
last two jobs have seemed an awful lot like her
husbands work and the cap future stuff had a
great similarity to bracketts type could i be
tfrohg or are they actually collaborating a little
bit or perhaps revising each others manuscripts
woman from altair was good but it was
not injected with the pathos that appears in other
brackett tales witch war was cute to say
the least although the idea is by no means new
and in my humble opinion could have used some
background padding the ultimate engine
was satisfactory though for reasons which perhaps
you dont want revealed i should just shut up
about it however i really have found carter
sprague and matt lee quite all right sam merwin
jr has been getting along pretty well also es-
pecially that novelette in the last tws i psii

  now i intend to keep my little nose clean so
will not allow it to protrude into the various dis-
cussions going on i will say that ye editor is more
toned down than usual i will say that the coles
were as easy and interesting reading as always

om page 

and that joe gibson was likewise though he used
more words a surprise in the letter column this
time was the large amount of people whose names
i recognize usually there are few of such and
as has been observed many times before letter
writers come and go how many of the people who
were composing missives when i first began a scant
two or three years ago are still showing up in letter
columns not many it makes me feel im getting
old-and at my age too i its a laugh

   i would like to comment on your new system of
reviewing fanzines for various reasons perhaps
not all of them impersonal i am not in favor of it
i liked the old version better i shall enumerate
some of these reasons first of all fan-fare
has been published eight times now and in the
seven reviews that have appeared fan-fare has
been on the b-list or its new equivalent seven
times  dont like to say this because it sounds
conceited to me when i see others doing the same
thing but i firmly believe my fanzine is worthy
of more recognition than it is obtaining in star-
tling stories perhaps not so much the
regular issues although they are certoinly nothing
to apologize for but definitely the anniversary
issue let me refresh your mind and instead of
being interviewed by fans for fanzines as you
anecdote-d for hours on end spend some of the
time relooking at that issue it was the january
 issue and contained  pages x includ-
ing two covers there were five stories one of
them  words long it was mimeographed at
least as well as the last issue of the old dream
quest vol   and i think about as well
as nekromantikon of course i am unable
to print or multigraph or offset or otherwise dupli-
cate it or parts of it but my mimeoing is neater
than typing so that shouldnt count as a drawback

  if you remember unless youve deposited in the
bank the old system divided the fanzines into the
good batch the a-list and the not-so-good
batch the b-list at times the a-list was
very short at times it was very long i think
fan-farf is good enough to have
got into the a-list under the old
system so perhaps my beef is mainly selfish
but that doesnt make it any less true under the
old system all the really good fanzines were given
due recognition now only ten are afforded pub-
licity one month there may be only five or six
really good fanzines and you will have to pick
some not-so-hot jobs other times youll have more
than ten magazines all of which are outstanding
all of which are worthy of recognition thus some
which do not deserve recognition are getting it
and some which deserve it are denied it is this
not true

  here is another phase of the argument i have
put out an issue of a fanzine which contains what
i consider good material printed on the best paper i
could find mimeographed as perfectly as multi-
graphing containing good illustrations timely book
reviews and an interesting guest editorial i have
done my best the best i know how and what
happens it is stuck down there among other al-
the ether vibrates	

mosts-and among dirty one-sheet
rags that some fan turned out in
a couple of days and that con-
tain some insignificant drivel my
efforts are not made worthwhile but even worse
i am no better off than when i started i can work
steadily for two solid months as i did to pro-
duce another superissue but it wont be any better
than before ill still make the same mistakes if
there are mistakes what am i doing
wrong no one tells me you dont all you
do is list my magazine and address and price i
admit that i thought you used to be a little hard
on the fanzines before especially the bs-but
youre an editor a competent man a guy who
knows wots wotl if you deride something there
is a good chance that you have a good reason if
you say i am publishing poor fan fiction then
there-i know one of the troubles and can seek
to better it i i would rather have you tear fan-
fare apart than cast it aside without a word
once youve tom it apart i can salvage what is
good from the ruins and add superior stuff know-
ing the defects of the former attempt

  and what is a darn sight more puzzling-rog
phillips writes a whole column that was his
writing not my review in his column on fan-
fare and raves about it while giving honest
criticism here ard there where it would do the most
good and my spies report that taurasi in the
triple-s did somewhat likewise though that maga-
zine is not available hereabouts what am i to
think 

  i have two favors to request the first which

i	have no illusions about-i doubt any action will
result is that you either return to the old system
of rating or else compromise and criticize the
mags all of them after all it is a department
of comment and criticism devoted to fandom
the second favor is that either in tins column or
in a private letter tell me what was
wrong with the january fan-
fare

  didja notice they named a mag after my mag
- ward rom north tonawanda nnv york

  as you may have noticed paul we have sus-
pended the ten best system at least until we
learn the ropes and after that well see up
to now our contact with fanzines has been occa-
sional not professional and we have no devel-
oped criterion we havent even decided yet
whether fanzines as a whole should be encour-
aged or discouraged but on the face of it how
can you have anything but admiration for some-
one who puts everything hes got including
everything he can scrape up in the way of cash
into his brain child that make you feel any
better 

a plug for childhood

by e e newlin jr

dear ed

  although a few months ago you probably heaved
a sich of relief supposedly safe in the assurance

that you were through with me for good one-
or perhaps two-things have prompted me to return
from comparative letter-hack retirement

  one is the magnetic-type attraction that ether-
grams emanates and the other is this recent
craze for maturity i can hardly open the pages
of any stf mag without finding something about the
fervid quest for maturity it seems to be treated
even worshipped as a panacea as far as stfs
troubles are concerned

  we want more mature covers more mature
stories more mature editorials more mature letter
columns-everything but more mature readers if
a story is bad it is immature bad is synonymous
with immature of course

  luckily the maturity that you planned on pinning
on ethergrams hasnt made too great an
effect-oh its taken out some of the punch that
ethergrams used to have but it hasnt killed
the good-natured atmosphere of good semi-clean
fun

  its been my observation that the most immature
are the quickest to brand others with that curse   
hoping to disguise their immaturity by that ignoble
shield and on close study we find maturity to be
a very liquid word mr webster  family might
tell you it meant ripe perfected by time or natural
growth however rogets thesaurus gives us
maturity decline decay senility  c he pre-
sents a very gloomy picture of maturity-age an-
tiquity  cobwebs o antiquity and such grim phrases

  now where he asks coyly does stf fit with
that can you picture a gasping gray-beard totter-
ing through the swamps of venus or a great-
grandfather blasting off for mars of course
there is always the deep thought-type of story
this is fine but without a little bit of juicy action
the tale is a dud naturally i have nothing against
purposeful science-fiction but i guess that youll
agree with me old thing that the main purpose
of stf is sheer entertainment and now that some
of the best writers are saving their best stuff for
the slicks we need a decided amount of emphasis
on the entertainment

  but so much for maturity before i close id
like to say a thing or three about richard mathe-
son i like him and id be glad to see more of
him but i wish the fellow would settle on one
set style so far ive read three different stories
in three different styles of his    and i may be
venturing too much on the statement but i think
matheson could develop a style which would mark
him almost as bradburys style has marked brad-
bury hmmm- peck avenue san antonio
 texas

  well grant you this much that any quest
for maturity or anything else can be very phony
indeed having participated in more than
enough literary evenings where all the intel-
lectuals sat around with a glass in one hand
and a quip on the tongue trying to impress each
other and having been thoroughly bored by the
same dialogue over and over again we know
what you mean but i dont think theres any-
thing phony about this particular quest for ma-
turity you can after all have two kinds of
	startling stories

science-fiction the comic strip kind or the in-
telligent kind the comic strip kind is a western
with ray-guns instead of colts and adds noth-
ing to the stature of the field the thoughtful
kind founds a new literature where the raw
space opera is going nowhere the more mature
-if youll pardon the expression-story is only
the beginning of something bigger in order to
print sucli stories you have to have reasonably
mature readers and you have to be able to under-
stand each other when you discuss the factors
involved

  this is not to cast any aspersions on good
clean fun lets keep it but lets not clown all
the time matter of fact we happen to like con-
siderable spoofing in our stf stories ourselves
and have been frequently downcast in the past
by having some fans sneer at stories written for
a chuckle or for satire anyway stick with us
and see what happens

call for captain future

by raul garcia capella jr

dear ed

  theres a rather spcciai reason for my writing
to ss-since you sec i dont often write to mags
im looking for a captain future mag that came
out a long time ago trouble is i dont know its
date or number the only thing i have to go on is
the cover and story so   

  	the plot a dark star is approaching the solar
system threatening to engulf it the only man
with the power to stop it-or so he claims-is some
doctor or professor who wants to be ruler of the
system in exchange for his services c f tells the
government to hold on as long as they can while he
looks into the matter during the course of the
adventure his ship is crippled and is sucked into the
sargasso sea of space to get out of it his ship
needs extra power he goes space-suited into a
derelict ard gets some generators or something of
the sort hes caught in the act of taking them by
what is left of the crew these characters are
aliens this is the scene for the   

  	cover cf is before the controls of a space-
ship tangling with the aliens-if im not mistaken
they were green tentacled bems the girl is on
the left of the picture now to go on with   

  	the plot cf gets to one of plutos moons-
styx-which is supposedly covered by water cf
lands on dry land-the water is an illusion created
by an unsociable race living there cf finds out
that the dark star is an illusion covering a space-
ship this is a job for-sorry got carried
away anyhow cf boards the evil-doers ship
there is a scuffle from which cf comes out on top
they live liappily ever after finis a later story
called magic moon was a sort of sequel to it

  if you know the name of the story the number
or date of the mag-would you please stick it in
a little corner of tev and if you dont remem-
ber-would you print my letter so fans can help
me id like to have the mag cause it was the

first s-f yarn full-length i ever read id ap-
preciate it very much if you gave me a hand-its
the only way i can get it thanks- clinton
ave brooklyn  m y

  weve read it but its antecedants go back to
a slightly less organized past so we cant be
omniscient and haul forth the issue number and
date just like that well pass this to the read-
ers-and theyll give you the business never
fear

ask a foolish question   

by bill warren

dear editor merwin

  ive got no quarrel with the stories in the july
ss-none at all in fact i am of the considered
opinion that they are pretty dem good i expect
most of your mail will give the long tales of the
issue good notices but id like especially to mention
the little short one you stuck in just before tev
witch war this one had a lot of moxie most
of which was due to tlie distinctive style very
effective-tho i suspect that if a stray english
teacher happened to read it he probably had a bad
case of the shakes as a result of seeing all the
sentence fragments actually this employment of
phrases added mightily to the atmosphere of the
piece i expect you bought the yam for this rea-
son-no

  i quote from the dark tower    her
breasts rose proudly under the translucent silk
why is it that breasts must always rise proudly
why not jut rudely spread softly rear astonish-
ingly droop listlessly perk coyly or maybe for
the hell of it an author might just let them lay
diere dont get me wrong i think the rose
proudly phrase denotes most interesting activity
and i am all for it but you know what they say
about variety and spice and all that

  can we have your opinion mr merwin-
west main street sterling kansas

  this reminds me of an old joke in which the
punch line runs shucks we aint gonna dig
him up just to ask him that anyway we
refuse to answer this question upon good and
obvious grounds an editor doesnt have to put
himself on record about everything does he

dingus

by joe gibson

dear sam

 afraid your commentary on wests dark
tower was true only insofar as totally un-
expected incident is concerned certainly the
memory bank idea couldve had more far-reaching
conscquence to the story than to be used merely as
a gimmick whereby the author could indulge in a
little scandalous playing with the usual degrada-
tion of a corrupt civilization and weve had cor-
rupt civilizations and space-roving barbarian hordes
and things from the outer darkness dominating
tiie ether

stf so often the past fifteen years it amounts to a
plague where west did succeed was in taking
such well-worn protagonists and making under-
standable characters of them too bad he didnt do
it with some new protagonists though why
rolphs brudders had to be pseudo-vikings beats
me

  that dingus between you and canuck morse in
ethcrgrams lias me pawing my beard since when
were bradburys martian chronicles a
dependable reference to human cussedness and
what do you know about buffalo bills shooting
alien steaks in the first place a spaceships ex-
peditionary crew be they charles atlas graduates
or scientific geniuses cannot be classified as nor-
mal human beings to do so is to judge others
by yourself which is bradburys trap in my estima-
tion a spaceships expeditionary crew might be
normal only so far as the foot of the ladder
leading up to the ships airlock when they stop tor
a last look around at mother earth the men who
climb that ladder wont be the same frontiersmen
are not and never were the same as the civilized
sheep they leave behind

  the first men who plunged into the american
wilderness to explore werent indian haters-they
lived with the tribes only the gold-seeking span-
ish conquistadores and the land-hungry settlers of
the american colonies fought the indians it was
the greenhorn trigger-happy emigrants of the
wagon trains who coined the phrase only good
injun is a dead injun not the frontiersmen it
was the criminal elements driven out of the east
that created most of the warfare with the indians
in the west when the indians massed and at-
tacked in the only kind of defense they knew the
frontiersmen were forced to organize the settlers
and fight back or be wiped out-though some
frontiersmen whom the settlers naturally despised
sided with the indians very little is said about
them in our history books

  as for your disinterest in making the trip to the
moon sam you dont seem to realize that founding
a base on that pitted satellite will teach us much
about the problems of founding bases on other alien
worlds-if it doesnt kill us your refusal to take
the risks so that other men might fare better cer-
tainly wont get you very far up that ladder to the
ships airlock reckless courage wont help much
either the only way to remain alive in a wilder-
ness-virgin forests a jet-fighter at  feet
or a base on another world-is to know what youre
doing and the only way to know in the unknown
is to learn learn or die i f alien intelligent beings
meet these crewmen-the ones who survive-they
arent likely to be carved up as steaks

  in short its hardly accurate to judge the men
who open new frontiers by the human sheep who
follow them seeking selfish opportunity

  bills invitation to a hand of poker reminds me
of why i quit the game-rather quit active par-
ticipation lets say best way to sit in on a poker
game is as in bills case a representative of the
bank of canada pick out a fairly skilled player
whos losing then stake him to a couple of bucks
to keep him in the game seven to ten his luck
changes with your stake and he starts winning
conditions of the stake are that you get half the
winnings to be called for at your discretion when
the guy wins six bucks take three-making you a

vibrates	

dollar to the good-and stake another losing player
by keeping your mouth shut and your billfold out
of sight you can keep the game going all night
and end up with more winnings than any of em
without ever having touched the cards i quit
fiddling the pasteboards back on the seine river

  and i did mean west of the mississippi not the
hudson sam was once a bandy-legged brat on
a little cow spread some sixty miles west by north
of the santa fe national forest in as wild a
tangle of badlands as found anywhere in new
mexico

  but when you say the whole material purpose
of civilization is to banish the discomfort of the
wilderness for the proper civilized human environ-
ment of clipped lawn and smooth sidewalk are
you sure you havent bit a fallacy there seems
to me this proper civilized human environment
we have today still isnt far removed from dis-
comfort and has a hell of a long way to go before
it can justifiably be called civilization

  also next time you sit on hard bleachers in a
broiling sun to yell at a bunch of guys running
jumping and skidding around a baseball diamond
sit back and observe your pathological urge to
endure discomfort without need in the name of
pleasure doing its stuff personally i dont even
prefer it on smoke-screened tavern television-
 kensington ave jersey city  nj

  we really shouldnt get into this argument
since it seems to concern only gibson and mer-
win but one sentence screams for comment
in short its hardly accurate to judge the men
who open new frontiers by the human sheep who
follow them seeking selfish opportunity

  what do you thirk the men who opened the
new frontiers were seeking joe and if you
want to take our own west as a sample were
there ever a more greedy ruthless murdering
bunch than a lot of the tough monkeys who went
forth to kill indians slaughter the game wipe
out the forests destroy the soil rip out the oil
and gold and coal and generally wreak havoc
on a country so big and lush with natural re-
sources that it was thought something like 
years would be required to settle it

  there were heroes among the early pioneers
all right but the word courage is not always
synonymous with nobility in fact some very
brave characters have also been complete heels
-present company excepted of course

of all things

by pat farrell

dear sam

  wha hoppen you burst out in january with
a swell cover then in march you slap on a hum-
dinger by the way lets hope that the gal on the
march cover is not a heavy breather if she was
she would stand an even chance of becoming in-
decent but back to praising and criticizing your
covers as i said you had swell covers in jan
and march but then you come out and tag that
stinker on your july issue why dont you tell your
chief artist to bone up on astrogation those ships
squirting red stuff at the tower are going to have
one heck of a wreck also if your artist had read
the story he would have noticed that half or more
of the ships were barb globes not elongated pop-
sides as buster brown alias artist has em

  id like to say a few words about the dark
tower i plead on bended knees if west wants
to write like that lock the doors bar the windows
and invent any kind of buck rogers ray gun to
keep him out lets have more action and less
fiddling around with memory banks and martians
also lets have more shorts and less ten-million
word monstrosities

  well heres my farrell rating on the stories in
 the july issue

  witch war it was okay cept that it was too
short

  the ultimate engine lit wasnt quite up to your
 usual standards

  the woman from altair it was pretty good
but it was too melodramatic

  the dark tower in my opinion and the opinions
of a mob of my friends it was as dead as a door-
knob th auld barbs a their bonny kilties was a
little too much for me to stomach

  but enough of nasty cracks about your mag i
started reading ss in so thats what started
me going on stf from then ive branched out to
nothing in particular in a very small way

  well its time to sign off my visiscrccn alias
 dinner is calling

  if all the heavy breathing engendered by our
march cover could only have been collected in
one place it would have floated the lighter-
tlian-air craft of seven navies thats why we
did it anyway thanks for noticing

    to fans commenting on law of gravity in con-
  nection with the bergey cover of the march num-
  berflash bulliten from interplanetary physi-
  cal congres-the law of gravity has just been
  repealed  plop ii the gown just fell off the
  cover girl    hmmmm   

    concerning your editorial  on the new 
  mediums that stf is being reproduced in lets
  take the movies first

     there is a new monstrosity out that goes under
  the name of the thing as has been reported
  before in the pages of several of the competitors
  it is derived from who goes there by johnny
  campbell who mentioned that name here all
  and well but  the plot remains  at least
  basically    the same the air force at the
  north pole discovers a huge flying typewriter
  disk  i mean flying saucer    imbedded in
  the ice in the aforementioned region upon investi-
  gation an intelligent vegetable is discovered this
  glob of gook  to the ghost of shaw if he be
  peering over my shoulder no harm meant by the
  term glob of gook to denote a vegetable 
  is possessed with a palate for blood ahahaaha
  the plot thickens-the nearest and most easily avail-
  able source of blood is dear old homo sap the
  world is endangered so says the blurbs on the
  posters

    the critics gave the picture a pretty good
  rating but there was something in there the
  reviews that indicated to me that something-
  stmks-in-norway-tonight-that-isnt-codfish most
  reviews contained a statement that ran something
  like the following-the sf boys have managed
  to turn out a pretty good picce of wierd horror
  what gives wit dese here characters by camp-
  bells own admission the story as were all of the
  don a stuart stories was written to portray the
  reaction of humans to a given situation not as a
  piece of horror

    that seems to be the main drawback of all of

  hollywoods stf----the pictures are either corny

  space operabem fem and hero----weird

  horror stupid at that  or worse

    some of bradburys stuff would be terrific on
  the screen but where in all creation is a group of
  actors that can portray some of his character
  while were on bradbury there is the matter of
  comrade pomerantzs statement rays stories are
  
in many cases not stf in the strict sense of the
word

  then there is the current argument about the
state that man should develop into ie the so-called
pure logic as exemplified by van vogt and the
complete man that is supposedly supported by
bradbury my opinion is that somebody is making
a mountain out of ye olde proverbial molehill van
vogts philosophy i giiess you can call it that
does not do away with emotions on the con-
trary  the null-a theory produces emotion
plus not emotion nillthe routing of the im-
pulse through the cortex and the thought there-
after is not devoid of emotion  it enriches it
emotion

  bradburys stories about the burning of fantasy
does bring out something-no totalitarian state
would allow fantasy to exist fantasy involves free
imaginative thinking which a totalitarian state
most certainly does not want some people get the
impression from his work that science would de-
stroy fantasy i think that this premise is wrong
scientific advance involves imaginative thinking
so why destroy a medium that stimulates it

dear sam

  the cover on the latest ss is not so hot would
be more fitting seen on a copy of scintillating
stories of impossible adventures on other planets
but it is a thousand percent better than those
things you have been featuring up till the new era
of a few months ago i presume it is by bergey
though i cannot discern his signature

  the woman from altair is by far the best
story in this particular issue although i havent
as yet completed the novel the shorts were rather
weak with matheson being the leader your alter
ego has turned out a story that has not been
equaled for pure hack in many a year with the
exception of that crud to be found in a recent
semi-comic book which now thank god seems
to be defunct i have just one old and oft voiced
question wha hoppen

  who is alex schomburg his illustrations are
among the best of any artist ever to have seen
print in any of your mags which includes virgil
finlay i like muchly his stuff enhances a story
making it more enjoyable to me as a reader i
hope he is a permanent addition to the thrilling
pub art staff

  i hope you peruse closely the article by walter

   referring to your editorial i believe that it could
be proved -or what passes for proof-that stf
or stfantasy goes all the way back to the earliest
day of cavemen the first story tetters grouped
around campfires would certainly be classified as
the best fantasy writers now in business for out
of their tortured minds came the folklore and
superstitions of their whole races and these fitted
the basic needs of these peoples for if they had
nothing to be afraid of it is almost certain that
they would never have developed protective devices
such as fire the bow and arrow wheels for speedier
flight i think this was the real purpose of wheels
as originally intended and everything else which is
the foundation of our present civilization perhaps
i had better say makes up the foundation for it
in itself is not the whole

  tev was up to its usual high quality this time
alfred w purdy was good in his lead-off spot
with the coles and joe gibson being up in the
foreground as are they always

  with which i take my leave until tomorrow nite

  if its schomburg you want bob i trust you
have already seen the october tws which has
a schomburg cover that is really something no
also in that october issue you should have seen

one mans family

by jimmy sims

dear editor

  i have just finished the july issue of startling
stories and enjoyed it a good deal it was not up
to par in my opinion though the best story was
leigh bracketts the woman from al-
tair the dark tower was also an ex-
cellent novel but both short stories didnt please
or interest me in the least of your recent featured
novels the best was starmen of llyrdis

  if you dont watch out you are going to lose
your spot as the best book of science fiction to
thrilling wonder stories with such stories as
overlords of maxus i the un-mor-
tal new bodies for old the new
reality and the citadel of lost
ages

  it is interesting to watch how different authors
take over the leadership in the science fiction field
for different periods of time when i first started
reading this type of story the leader was edmond
hamilton with his captain future stories and
star of life he was soon replaced by henry
kuttner with such classics as the dark
world valley of the flame and the
time axis now it is leigh brackett with her
stories of the future mrs hamilton had done
well for startling stories but better for thrilling
wonder with such fine novels as the sea
kings of mars her best hero though is eric
john stark in his series in another magazine

    who dares say that hamilton and startling
  should let old cap future die he has earned
  a place in my heart and i am sure in the hearts of
  many others that  upstart hero will ever replace
  let him take a vacation but please dont let him
  die

     despite the criticism i still like startling best-
  troy alabama

    were not denying that there have been some
  excellent captain future stories-would we be
  likely but on the whole we had the feeling
  that captain future belonged to a somewhat
  earlier era of science-fiction we could be
  wrong of course if the small voices in the
  wilderness which want him back should rise to
  a mighty storm we would have to admit we
  were wrong

 where every prospect pleases

  by edward g seibel

  dear editor

    i was quite pleasantly surprised yesterday when
  mom brought home the latest startling
  first by the cover and then by your kind compliance
  with my request

    when mom brought the book in she as usual
  left it in my bedroom i came home a while after
  that and upon entering my bedroom found my
  eyes drawn immediately to the middle of the bed
  where reposed the most beautiful cover on your
  magazine i have ever seen for the next ten
  minutes i sat on the edge of the bed holding that
  wonderful bergey cover in reverent hands admir-
  ing admiring   

    at the end of ten minutes i wrenched my gaze
  from the cover and opening the book began to
  faithfully read your editorial perhaps admittedly
  i dont agree  a few points in each of your
  editorials who ever agrees completely with an-
  other person but i always find them either in-
  formative or thought-provoking or both

    finishing your editorial i began to browse
  through the letter section halfway through i hap-
  pened to remember a letter in another issue written
  to you by a fan who said twelve was normal men-
  tality etc which recalled to me the stanford
  achievement tests they gave in each grade in gram-
  mar school just as each school year had begun

     i hesitate to say it for fear of appearing foolish
  but at the beginning of the sixth grade i made
  i think  or  i only caught a glimpse of
  the record sheet after which they promptly moved
  me to the seventh grade and would have put me
  in the eighth except for moms violent objections

    ever since that time i have been curious about
  how they rated those tests but no one would ever
  tell me your fans letter revived that old memory
  and that still unsatisfied curiosity could you by
  any chance tell me how they rate those tests

     finally i reached the last page of the letter sec-
  tion where i was most pleasantly surprised by
  seeing my letter in print and your answer below
  it-boy you dont know how shortly i did find
  out the moment i finished reading your reply and
  having not yet moved a muscle dad walked into
  g
 the room and dropped the card in front of me from
 the fantasy press which informed me where to
 send and how much for each book thats what
 i call service

   before i detail the stories in the issue i wish
 to set your mind at ease by saying i shall not
 come at you with the face of a cerastes and swish-
 ing my cestus in your direction namely i shall
 try not to be curmudgeonish

   first the novel was of a sufficient length to
 deserve the term it was a forceful attention-
 drawing well-woven story with very credible
 people it is definitely not space opera only a fool
 would say that

   in her novelet miss brackett certainly outdid
 herself it held my attention all the way with
 frightening realism

   spragues short story was entertaining thats
 all i demand of a story

  after reading witch war i walked warily
 around young females

   if you keep the standards of your stories as high
 as this issues was that cestus will never be swung

   glancing through your review of fan publica-
 tions i was moved to gales of laughter by the
 coles ghastly title great galaxy-po box
  oliverhurst cal

   the only way to walk around young females
 is warily ed havent you discovered that yet
 i am glad to hear you are a genius it makes me
 feel better about the kind of magazine we put
 out i dont know much about the stanford tests
 except that the kids are getting them in gram-
 mar school the only test i ever took was the
 regular army alpha test which was given to
 the class as a gag by my psychology instructor
 up at columbia the test was supposed to take
 four hours i think and he generously gave us
  minutes i remember finishing all the ques-
 tions but nobody ever rated it so i never did
 find out whether or not i was a genius why
 dont you go to the library and get yourself a
 book

lonely hearts club

by earl downey

dear editor

i have  reasons for writing this letter it wont
be a long letter as i am in a hurry right now

 first reason is to tell you how much i liked
your stories in the july issue so here goes

	the woman from alt air this
was a superb storie hope to see more like it soon

	the dark towerthis storie ran a

close race with bracketts tile

the shorts were good so i will go on to my
other subjects

 i would like to correspond with someone any-
body around here there just arent any sf readers

so somebody please drop me a line or six even
seven

  	my last but not least reason for writing is
to ask just how to go about getting a storie on
to your hallowed desk huh

  oh by the way i think  i read in tev that
some of your readers dont like humor in
the reader section well the inoon devils are
hopping over my typewriter so after guzzling
a gallon of jupcternian oof joy juice i jump
somwhat giddily onto my gloopzer they are back
in style you know and gallop back into the space
hole from which i came happily blasting all the
pink and purple time machines i see-route 
gadsden ala

  look earl anybody is welcome to drop a
story or a cash contribution on this hallowed
desk but youd better clean up that spelling a
little bit and as for jupiternian joy juice-
brother havent you heard what happened to
sergeant saturn and his jug of xeno if any
of you still want to write to him i wash my
hands of the whole affair

  see you all in a couple of months

the thing we like best about the fanzines
is the near-complete lack of inhibitions
required a prozine editor can only wist-
fully regard such freedom of expression with
his own libel problems riding his neck such
freedom of course places the burden of good
taste on the fan editor not to mention good

judgment one of the things which happens to
a fan is that he becomes a specialist and speciali-
zation often leads to splinter groups and splin-
ters sometimes spend more time assailing each
other than toiling for the uplifting of the world

  the results however are often hilarious as
witness this tidbit culled from orgasm

 reviews of new books

rockets missiles and space travel by willy ley
the viking press new york 

each issue of this monumental work be-
comes more imposing and for those who
are interested in the whys andwherefors of
science-fiction it provides an indispenable back-
ground

  the first issue of rockets appeared
in  and each new edition saw enlargements
and additions

  the complete record of mans yearning to
reach the stars is here from the earliest fum-
bling experiments in the dark ages of science
to the present

  the ancients dreamed of flying to other
planets but the dream was only a dream despite
the fact that the rocket had been in existence
probably since  bc however toy rockets
fired by celebrating chinese are a very far cry
from interplanetary rockets carrying a pay load
rockets for war purposes are mentioned back
in  and an italian historian named mura-
tori gives credit to a rocket for victory in the
battle for the isle of chiozza in  but the
rocket declined and won little interest until the
nazis brought it back as a weapon in world
war ii and it was their development of the
v-l and v- which led ultimately to white
sands and our own governments interest in
rocket propulsion as so often unfortunately
happens it takes a war to spur the development
of a device which might otherwise lie idle for
centuries

  so begins the era of the space ship and with
it conies the most fascinating section of mr
leys book the seriousness with which the
problems of building and navigating a space
ship are discussed the problems of lunar bases
the charts and graphs and tables and equations
worked out to solve problems are astonishing
they would have been considered sheer in-
sanity a few years ago but today they seem
quite real

  a profusion of illustrations explain many of
the more technical aspects or merely lend ex-
citement as in some of the stills from the

chesley bonestell painting for destina-
tion moon one of which graces the cover

rogue queen by l sprague de camp doubleday 
company inc carden city n y 

  sprague de camp has a growing list of gentle
satires to his credit and rogue queen is
another in the same vein the story is relative-
ly unimportant it is there only as a vehicle for
the author to ride in while he pokes fun at
humans and their frailties or for that matter
bees and their frailties a good satirist is com-
pletely democratic in his choice of victims and
spares none worthy of his attention

  rogue queen unwinds on a mythical
planet populated by colonies of humanoid mam-
mals who function like bees there is a queen
who lays eggs drones whose sole task in life is
to fertilize her and female workers whose lives
are uninspired by sex a space ship from earth
landing here provides the yeast for a frothy
ferment during which one of the female workers
absorbs enough revolutionary ideas to make
serious inroads upon the culture of her people
all of which provides plenty of opportunity for
spoofing

  there is some question in our minds as to
whether this is science-fiction in the usual sense
it could be argued that it is certainly as much
science-fiction as gullivers travels
and that would be true but it is a relative
term science-fiction has evolved since swifts
day just as the detective story has evolved
since poes day and with increasing familiar-
ity the reader instinctively moves in the direc-
tion of the more advanced more sophisticated
ideas yet for general book sale there is no
question but that these books are better adapted
than some of the highly specialized stories in
the magazines which would floor a beginning
reader

irkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkick-kkk-kkkkk

making excuses for the crudities of some stf
stories on the grounds that the writers had to
be engineers rather than authors this is your
dish

  the book consists of four stories three novel-
ettes and a short beyond infinity the
long novelette which gives the book its name
is high-grade stuff an absorbing detour into
time and space not as elemental as many of
these things are but with something up the
authors sleeve for a final surprise moreover
mr carr brings something of the technique of
the well-written detective story to it the crisp
dialogue the casual handling of emotion to sug-
gest instead of wallowing in sentiment the
good characterizations are all to its credit

 those men from mars is another
goody a rib-tickling satire on human and mar-
tian frailties the landing of two martian space-
ships on earth-one on the white house lawn
the other in moscow gives mr carr a chance
to lav about him with a satirical pikestaff which
spares no one this and beyond infinity
are the best stories in the book morning
star is a much more conventional thing-
the secret watchers from space idea handled
with competence but will be quite familiar
and mutation is even more familiar-the
well known shower of atomic bombs which
nearly wipes out mankind also produces a
super-race seven feet tall with built-in haloes

and dispositions like great danes there can be
no doubt mr carrs tongue was firmly in his
cheek as he wrote it but the spoofing was not
quite on the order of those men from
mars however the two preferred stories
are worth the price of the book

  the jackct design by hannes bok illustrates
the launching of the rocket ship from be-
yond infinity strongly reminiscent of
when worlds collide

dragons island by jack williamson simon 
schuster new york 

  this is a high-tension mystery-adventure
story with scientifically-induced mutation as
its basis for stf laid in the near-future it
takes its hero scientist dane belfast on a
tight high-wire between elements supporting
and seeking the destruction of the amazing ex-
periments of supposedly dead geneticist charles
kenrew known to the initiate by a very dif-
ferent name

  it is packed throughout with violence and the
threat of violence as belfast becomes a sort of
human rope in a deadly tug of war is finally
flown to new guinea seat of the climate muta-
tion experiments much of the mystery involved
concerns who is for whom in the contest and
whether kendrew is really as dead as the slim
records make him

  really a space opera without space dragons
island should appeal to a wide public including
lovers not only of stf but of mystery and ad-
venture stories as well

renaissance by raymond f jones cnome press
new york 

  this we suspect is one of mr jones earlier
opera it reveals less discipline in concept and
idea than this gifted authors more recent work
has a looseness of characterization and incident
that also suggest a less polished craftsmanship
than jones has shown consistently of late

  yet in its very wildness and speed and casual-
ness of portraying the folk involved it attains
a pace and imaginative appeal that have their
own strength and charm for the reader it
contains one of the damnedest patterns of sym-
biotic cultures carefully divided by time space
and disaster of which we have ever read and
its hero ketan lives well up to all legends of
supermen in revolt against an order whose
constrictions he is innately unable to accept

  god fun combined with some moments of
real horror and excitement and a fat handful of
provocative ideas for spice

comparisons will inevitably be made
between destination moon and
when worlds collide so we might
a well deal with these at once

the intent seems obvious to carry desti-

nation moons skeletal bareness of story
further so as to produce a fuller and more im-
pressive work instead of the simple attempt
to build a space rocket for its own sake the
almost equally elemental plot of the old balmer-
wylie novel was impressed for its more impell-
ing reason earth is about to be destroyed by
collision with an invading star

  this allows room for the human element
unfortunately a good deal of footage is frittered
away on an infantile love story tempered only
by the sheer pleasure of letting your eyes rest
upon barbara rush who is fantastically beau-
tiful in technicolor

  from the mechanical standpoint when
worlds collide is more flamboyant than
destination moon with the result that
the gadgets sometimes seemed more toy-like

the earlier picture thus retains a lead in tech-
nical integrity

  yet it is our feeling that these are compara-
tively minor matters at this stage of holly-
woods second discovery of science-fiction the
important fact is that this picture came fairly
close to bringing a science-fiction story to life
it offered a glimpse of the panic which dooms-
day would unleash and it achieved real suspense
even of a corny sort

  the fact that we could easily pick it to pieces
would mostly mean we were trying to show how
smart we were

  from the standpoint of the stf reader any
movie which visualizes in smashing color the
things he has so far only imagined from words
on a printed page is all to the good acknowl-
edging that it is slanted to a mass audience not
a specialized one the inevitable com the faked
props the space flight lasting ten minutes-all
these things must be allowed there could have
been much more on the rocket construction
much more on the actual take-off from eari
and the flight through space these would have
made a more vivid more compelling and even
more beautiful picture where bonestells talents
could have been more graphically employed but
these lacks were almost compensated for by
some effective shots of eruptions and earth-
quakes and tidal waves plus a palpably faked
but engaging view of times square under thirty
feet of water

  one jarring note was the painted backdrop of
the new planet revealed to the refugees as they
step out of the space ship it was a disney-like
landscape guaranteed to wring groans from the
most hardened fan to swipe an old gag this
never would have happened if bonestell had
been alive

 as in destination moon there were
no big names among the actors only richard
derr seen on tv screens was known to this
reviewer miss rushs beauty has already been
noted peter hanson as her unsuccessful lover
gave indications of charm all but strangled by
a poor part

  the final word youve probably anticipated
good better or best-you cant afford to miss it
