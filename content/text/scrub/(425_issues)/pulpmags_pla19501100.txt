mars is-hell jfxksn

according to an often reprinted story by
ray bradbury mars is heaven but ac-
cording to the new scientifilm rocket-
ship x-m mars is quite the opposite in fact
the warrior planet is found to have lived up to
its name and an atomic armageddon has de-
stroyed its civilization

  i have just come back from a trip to mars
the only survivor of a hundred million mile voy-
age thru the void you think me mad no crazier
than you will be to miss rocketship x-m
when it opens at your local theater  this is the
second of the interplanetary films to have been
produced in the forthcoming cycle and goes far
beyond the original destination moon
in mileage for while the x-m in the title
stands for expedition moon the  step-rocket
actually-thru mishap-lands on mars

  enroute to the moon a meteor shower imperils
the rocket all armchair astrogators will sweat
along with the cinematic explorers as the men-
acing swarm all but grazes the hull of the ship

  and then when calculations indicate the neces-
sity of changing course and fuel mixture an error
is made that causes the rocket to leap ahead with
dangerous acceleration the crew of five are all
knocked unconscious while the rocket rushes un-
checked thru the starry vacuum toward a new
destination-destination mars 
every red-blooded science fiction enthusiast will
thrill to the landing on the red planet when the
foot of man is first set down  million miles
away on the enigmatic world    world of som-
bre atmosphere crumbling rocks towering cliffs

violent lightning storms and-horrifying inhabi-
tants 

  yes the mars of this movie is inhabited the
martians are great tall dark-skinned humanoids
deformed by hideous scar tissues the end product
of their own nagasakic nightmare for atomi-
geddon has come to mars leaving it a ruined
world its ancient cities smashed its civilization
a memory its men degenerated to a stone age
level of living

  two of the crew of rocketship x-m are killed
on mars by the primitive mutants the remain-
ing three escape to earth but their fuel supply
gives out before a landing can be effected and
they perish in the resultant crash

  failure

  no in the closing words of the films dr flem-
ing the flight of the r-x-ivi established every
point of our rocket theory it proved interplane-
tary travel is not only possible but practicable
it demonstrated once again that no pioneering is
too difficult no dream unattainable when mans
vision is broad enough to encompass it no the
trip was not a failure tomorrow we start con-
struction on r-x-m-

  and if you would like to see a sequel urge your
friends to attend rocketship x-m when it
is released and drop a line to its producer kurt
neumann lippert productions  sunset
blvd hollywood  cal after you have seen
it letting him know how you enjoyed it and in-
dicating that you would support another in what
could well be a series of journeys into the
unknown

                    on that fog-shrouded vcnnsian monn
taintop lay an eternal pool where icy
diamonds and blood-red rabies emerald idols and rich yellow
gold sparkled seductively in darkling depths  and strid-
ing confidently up the strange path toward that island in the
sky came red rohan thief of venus rut the treasure of
course had a guardian a monster  or possibly a god 
you could see the mountain
sometimes on the clearer days
from as far away as the town
called foggy morning the unearthly
lands betweenswam in jungle stirring end-
lessly with the pale restless foliage of
venus garrulous jungle full of a con-
tinual murmur that had all the notes of

human speech imperfectly heard

  the quai told fabulous tales about the
mountain drawing up the third eyelid
dreamily over their yellow gaze and hum-
ming gently through their noses between
words in the disconcerting way of quai
they said there was a pool up there and
something in the pool they said the pool

the fog split and took fire and burned like the blaze of a white-hot sun


planet stories



was blue-under a sky of unbroken eter-
nal cloud the pool was blue

  they said there was a monster in it
possibly a god no terrestrial under-
stands quai speech very clearly yet so
they may have said both monster and god
it sounded intriguing but too remote to
interest anyone in the frontier towns
along the terrestrial highway terrestrial
holdings on venus are precarious yet
strung along a chain as narrow and peri-
lous as bifrost and infringments against
venus and quai have proved too danger-
ous for any man to commit more than
once

  three men slipped out of foggy morn-
ing just ahead of the vigilantes one day
getting the jungle equipment they needed
by direct and deadly means frontier jus-
tice being what it always is the vigi-
lantes pursued them only far enough to
make sure they would not return the
men were robbers if the vigilantes had
caught them they would have hanged them
but when they had chased them past the
turn-off that leads southwest toward flat-
tery and north toward adam and eve and
on along a little winding diminishing path
due west they paused and looked at each
other and began to laugh the path went
straight into forbidden quai lands and
its far end was the mountain the vigi-
lantes shrugged and went back to foggy
morning

  there were dvahnyan in the jungle
dvahnyan is a complex term but its basic
import is death-dealer the quai were
quite competent to look after their own
lands hanging might have been prefer-
able

the cavern was reasonably dry
considering it was reasonably safe
or as safe as any refuge could be in quai
territory a small soft fire burned in a
hollow of sand near one wall pale lav-
ender flames licking up and whimpering
in the annoying way all fire does on veijus
something in the wet air damps its color
and the flames never feel really hot even
when they bum you

  a man named rohan lay drowsily with
his back to the cavern wall and his eyes
shut singing to himself

  swing low he sang sweet chan-ot
cornin for to carry me home 

  condensing fog gathered in big drop
along the outer brow of the cave and
dripped continually as an obbligato to the
song and the whimper of the fire one
of the other men was sitting on his heels
just inside the fringe of dripping water
gun across his knee peering into the misty
jungle the third man threw down an
emptied ration-tin with violence and said
red

  rohan did not open his eyes

  yes my little friend he said

  red im sick of it im going back
you hear theres no use waiting any
longer barber isnt coming why should
we sit here waiting for the police to come
and get us i tell you theres been a
dvahnyan on our trail since yesterday
morning and i dont like it im going
back ill take my chances-

  rohan grinned sleepily

  if you get there before i do he sang
tell all my friends im cornin too-
its crazy the other man said it
isnt safe to wait around here any longer
im afraid of the dvahnyan if youre not
im going

  he made no further move rohan lis-
tened to the quiet complaint of the flames
and thought of the dvahnyan of venus

  the dvahnyms place in quai society
is not comparable to any terrestrial equiv-
alent he approximates police judge jury
and executioner all in one though his
powers are not limited to the enforcing
of justice he also-for no reason ter-
restrials have yet grasped-destroys trees
or whole forests burns occasional villages
dams or diverts rivers and at times steril-
izes the soil of agricultural areas his de-
cree is never questioned he is debarred
from the fields of science using the wea-
pons the blue-clad llghnrae give him with-
out understanding the principles of the
devices he wields the llghirae corres-
pond to scientists or priests of science
and are forbidden knowledge of the reali-
ties exactly what the quai mean by real-
ities is not yet known

  but a few of the more concrete realities
of life on venus the terrestrials have
learned fast often the hard way fore-
carry me home



most among them is the absolute power
of the dvahnyan to wield it they seem
to have surrendered much-perhaps the
whole ego as we think of it they rule
by a sort of divine right and no one
dreams of questioning or disobeying them
or lifting a hand against them their
lives are sacred and their decrees irre-
vocable

  i dont trust them forsythe said
again im going back

  the quai are a funny people rohan
said cheerfully opening his eyes a little
to peer out past the watcher on the thres-
hold and into the drifting mist they
work in a mysterious way their wonders
to perform an amazing race the quai
all right forsythe goodbye jellaby and
i are going to climb the mountain

forsythe jerked around

heavily his dark face flushing with
anger and incredulity even jellaby at
the door looked back over his shoulder
and his freckled jaw dropped

  what forsythe demanded

  you heard me

  i wont do it forsythe said excitedly
youre crazy that wasnt what you told
me you said barber jones would pick
us up at the clearing and fly us out with
the loot the road toward the mountain
was just to fool the vigilantes oh no
red oh no

  rohan rolled over lazily to face his
companions

  did you really think he inquired
that barber would bother with us if we
didnt get away with the bank hold-up
were in an interesting spot forsythe
my friend

  i dont like it forsythes voice was
heavy we should have left the bank
alone there was pretty near as much
money in the saloon safe but no we
had to bust into the bank and set off
the alarm in police headquarters clear
over the bay at swanport how long do
you figure before the police come for us
red

  rohan closed his fist on a handful of
moist sandy soil and let it trickle slowly
through his fingers his look was gently
marveling terrestrials were still so new

on venus that sometimes a man found
himself struck with astonishment at the
simple discovery that this world was made
of soil plain dirt rock sand prosaic as
earth itself you expected something
more glamorous f the morning star

  a band of akgels rohan sang corn-
in after me combi for to-

  you cant go up the mountain for-
sythe pursued doggedly whats the good
of it whats up there but some kind of
devil-fish in a pool  i tell you its crazy
whats up there my friends rohan
said and in the violet firelight his face
took on a sudden look like fever whats
up there is a fortune theres a pool all
right theres a-well some kind of a
monster and you know why its there
to guard a treasure jewels forsythe
rubies and diamonds jellaby for a thou-
sand years the quai have been throwing
offerings down to their monster-god and
nobody knows it except us not a soul ex-
cept us three thats why were going up
the mountain forsythe

  forsythe grunted

  you been dreaming he said

  i had it straight rohan said from
the horses mouth he laughed i got
it from crazy joe

  forsythes head snapped around sharp-
ly and he caught his breath to hoot with
angry derision but rohan saw the deri-
sion pause and heard the breath run out
in an uncertain half-reluctant sigh

  uh-huh rohan said think it over
i did i got him drunk you see first
time i ever saw crazy joe drunk but i
happened to be the lucky guy who drank
with him and he talked  

rohan half shut his eyes

and looked through his lids at the
dim complaining fire crazy joe he
thought how crazy babbling over his
liquor about a treasure hed seen and
walked away from not wanting it not
really caring that was crazy only a
crazy man would do it but wise in his
craziness with strange threads of sanity
twining through the warps of his mind
the quai paid him a curious respect and
abided by his owlish council they told
him things he was not too crazy to turn
	planet

to account sometimes it was probable
that he knew much more than he ever
admitted to he wandered freely in quai
territory and he knew what lay at the top
of the mountain   

  i saw him next day rohan said i
thought it might have been just drunken
talk but he claimed the whole thing was
true he told me all about it i believed
him rohan grinned would i be here
now if i hadnt why if even a part of
its true half the jewels on venus are
lying right up there on top of the moun-
tain just waiting for three guys like us
to come and get em

  then he shut his lips together on a
tight secret smile and thought of the
other thing crazy joe had said was up
there forsythe and jellaby were dubious
enough about the jewels what would
they say if he told them about the dvahn-
yan

  you neednt be afraid of the dvahn-
ym crazy joe had said combing his
beard through his fingers thoughtfully
drawing down his thick bleached brows
im not i know too much about em
i found out up there he had chuckled
looking shrewdly at rohan theyre not
so mysterious once you know the secret
its all up there the treasure the pool
the monster-and the secret of the dvahn-
yan

  rohan had regarded him dubiously
with rising excitement imperfectly tem-
pered by reason the strangest part of
the whole strange business was that he
believed crazy joe you had  to know
crazy joe to understand why nobody
knew what his real name was or where
he came from oddly there were times
when the part of his face that showed
between ragged beard and ragged bangs
had a distracting familiarity to rohan but
he could not identify it the man was
unquestionably mad but there was dignity
in his madness and he was not known
to distort the truth

  moreover he could talk to the quai
he had even been known to hold con-
versations with the dvahnyan at a dis-
tance looking up into those cold inhuman
faces and stroking his beard as he spoke
they never exchanged an unnecessary

stomues

word with sane humans but to crazy joe

they spoke with respect

  what do you know about them ro-
han had asked eagerly all his own hatred
and distrust of the dvahnyan boiling up
in him behind the question the inhuman
the unspeaking the terrible dvahnyam be-
cause of whom his one real success on
venus had been thwarted what do you
know 

  the secret of the dvahnyan crazy
joe had said mildly i cant tell you i
couldnt if i would it isnt a thing you
can tell you have to see it

  a weapon rohan had asked ur-
gently a machine a book come on
crazy joe give me an idea what is it
its up there on the mountain was
all crazy joe would say go up and see
for yourself i did im not afraid of
em now they talk to me if you want
to know about it youll have to go up
the mountain and find out it wont be
easy but what is go ahead find out for
yourself

  so rohan was going

his curiosity about thedvahnym
was devouring the death-dealers
were such a terrifying class of people
if you could call them people at all they
werent people they werent alive they
werent dead they were more like beings
from another star than creatures of hu-
man stock

  what their powers were nobody
knew though terrestrials made guesses
they could destroy at a distance in
many changing ways all of them ex-
plicable by analogy though the anal-
ogies might be quite wrong ultra-
sonic waves can focus invisibly to a point
and destroy with heat and vibration did
they kill with a power like that perhaps

  the intricate wrappings of gleaming
black stuff they wore interwoven with
shining curled threads might in them-
selves be some unearthly sort of weapon
as the winding of the armature on an
electromagnet controls its efficiency so
these elaborately wound patterns woven
with strange threads no terrestrial had
ever seen at close range might control

the enormously efficient powers the
dvahnyan wielded

  the sciences of the quai both paral-
leled and diverged from terrestrial
sciences no venusian has ever seen the
stars but from the structure of the atom
the quai evolved a very pretty picture of
their own sun and sister planets it was
known that they drew upon the very short-
wave radiations that filter through the
clouds of venus from the sun and stars
for example converting in controlling the
balance of food supply starch to sugar
with the aid of polarized infra-red as
terrestrials learned to do long ago there
can be biological converters as well as
technological ones so a converted energy
drawn from without or from within and
probably controlled by the gleaming black
wrappings of the dvahnyan was the wea-
pon they wielded but where they came
from what they were nobody knew per-
hapsnot even the quai

  perhaps crazy joe knew perhaps if
rohan reached the mountain he too
might know he only knew now that his
hatred of the dvahnyan was an uncon-
trollable and an irrational thing resem-
bling more a mans deep instinctive aver-
sion to an alien life-form than his dislike
of a fellow creature however unpleasant
they did not suffer from the drives that
made rohan what he was and he hated
them for that they were passionless and
he felt bewildered scorn for them they
were curiously selfless and he felt con-
tempt because of that but his reasoning
mind told him they were simply men after
all men who followed orders in what
they did as most men do he did not mean
to let them thwart him this time he was
afraid of them but he feared failure
more than the dvahnyan he would not
this time turn back for anything

  i dont know forsythe grumbled i
dont like it rohan it isnt safe that
mountains a long way off

  you like it here rohan inquired
smiling he rose limberly he was a tall
man good-looking pleasantly smiling you
had to look twice to see underneath the
kind of a man he was and had been

  you wait here he said and the
dvahnyan will come and get you you

go back and the vigilantes will string you
up unless the police get there first you
come with me and the chances are good
that a genuine authentic monster-god will
eat you but youll see such a treasure
before you die forsythe i promise youll
die happy

  the man in the doorway had been watch-
ing the jungle all this while but his large
ears were alert now without turning his
head he said hoarsely

  red how much of this did you plan
rohans pleasant face went blank with
guilelessness

  plan jellabyj

  you wouldnt have told us about the
treasure-if there is one-unless youd
needed us right you knew we wouldnt
run the risk on your say-so unless we had
to right so ill ask it again-how much
did you really plan

  forsythe was slower on the uptake but
he got the idea after a moment

  yeah he said and then with gather-
ing heat yeah red-what about that
you figured the bank hold-up didnt you
it couldnt be the saloon-it had to be
the bank so the police would chase us
if we muffed it you wanted the police
after us red so we couldnt turn back
so wed have to come along on your
crack-pot scheme into quai territory well
here we are we cant go back or for-
ward and all because youre as crazy
as crazy joe when it comes to money
red i-

  shut up forsythe rohan said in a
sudden whisper look out there-jella-
by is that something-something black

there was instant silence

in the cave the breathing of the
three men seemed loud in the close con-
fines of these rock walls which made up
an alien planet the dripping fog sang
plangently on the sill and the fire whim-
pered thinly to itself

  jellaby shifted the blaster in his hands
and his whole position changed so that
he seemed to become part of the weapon
lifting it toward the jungle path

  no rohan breathed careful jella-
by you dont know the quai dont
shoot just wait


planet stories

  red can you kill a dvahnyan for-
sythe asked in a faint voice

  i dont know id like to find out
rohans voice seemed to come through
his teeth his face had a touch of the
fever tint again in the violet firelight
and his eyes looked bright and hard id
like to know he said someday ill
find out maybe today maybe now if
theres any thing i hate-

  the mists parted dramatically and out
of the unveiled jungle aisle a tall black
figure with a white face came stalking
straight toward them jellabys finger
crooked convulsively on the trigger for-
sythe swore under his breath rohan
did not make a sound he stared eyes a
little glazed at the approaching figure

  a part of his mind reminded him that
the dvahnyan must be following orders
in what they did there had been noth-
ing personal in the ruthlessness of the
dvahnyan who three weeks ago had
stalked into rohans flourishing mine camp
on the outskirts of careless love and
with one gesture brought rohans whole
investment crashing

  but he felt the heavy beat of anger
throbbing above his ears as he thought of
it the rich lands of venus invited ex-
ploitation no frontier was ever a place
for the scrupulous and rohan had come
because his talents flourished best where
the law was weakest he had the seed of
greatess in him and he knew it unerringly
the knowledge had driven him all his life
but he needed a raw frontier to flourish
in and venus had seemed so perfectly
the place for him-until that dvahnyan
stepped out of the pale jungle and with
one gesture dismissed all the toiling
quai   

  theyre mine he had protested to
the passionless unseeing figure in black
they owe me more than they can pay
theyve got to work it out

  the dvahnym may not have heard at
all barter is something the quai society
does not recognize and so rohans bud-
ding empire crashed and he found himself
empty-handed again with empty pockets
with nothing but the driving knowledge
of his own potential power and a corro-
sive hatred for the dvahnyan who had

come between him and all that venus
promised

  he smiled pleasantly into the face of
the black-wrapped being before him of
course it hadnt been this particular
dvahnyan back in careless love-or had
it been how could you tell you tend
to think not of them but of him in
every separate case when you think of the
dvahnyan perhaps because you never see
more than one at a time and there is
no way whatever to tell them apart in-
evitably you come to feel that there is but
one omnipresent omnipotent dvahnyan
in all venus miraculously appearing in
hundreds of places at once empty-eyed
remote passionless he stalks about his
duties his very name means one who is
beyond life and death

the dvahnyan paused almost on the
threshold of the cave looking at
them out of remote indifferent yellow
eyes behind him there was a soft flurry
of motion among the pale trees and a
little group of quai in single file came
out one by one into the clearing behind
the dvahnyan and paused too looking into
the cave

   the quai were tallish men supple in in-
tricate tightly wrapped white waterproof
bindings that fitted them like a second
skin they looked like spectral mummies
with triangular faces and seal-sleek fur
for hair a quai is strikingly reminis-
cent of the little venusian tree-chuck that
slips quietly through the trembling foliage
looking down at you with a wondering
gaze while you are still an earthlubber
you may be reminded of a lemur or an
owl but after you know venus the quai
will remind you of the tree-chuck and
nothing else

  these four stood still and regarded the
terrestrials with an air of deprecating
curiosity the dvahnyan in glistening
black his remote gaze unfocused stood
facing the cavern watching some vacancy
in the air about six feet beyond the three
terrestrials he laid his right hand under
his left forearm letting his left palm
fall forward toward the cave the black
wrappings gloved him and their glistening
blinded the observer a little you could
carry me home	

never be sure if he really held a weapon
or not

  in a totally expressionless voice the
dvahnyan said

  the mountain is forbidden go back

  rohan smiled cheerfully the four quai
blinked their mild yellow eyes

  good afternoon gentlemen rohan
said we seem to have lost our way
hope we arent trespassing his smile
was ingratiating

  all four quai exposed their teeth in
a sudden unexpected snap at empty air
one of them said something that had the
overtones of a gregorian chant he added
a few words in ill-accented spanish all
of them profane then the four looked
at rohan in grave astonished inquiry and
put their hands on top of their seal-sleek
heads

  the dvahnyan might not have heard
he stood silent unmoving waiting ro-
han was aware of a little chill down his
back and he swallowed hard choking
down anger

  the mountain is forbidden the d-
vahnyan said again go-now

  rohan grinned deliberately certainly
he said glad to

  you dont argue with the dvahnyan
it was probably a great concession that
this one had repeated himself even once
rohan wondered if the thing-the man-
felt anything at all if he did he was
probably a little concerned about this ra-
ther delicate situation of trespass rela-
tions between terrestrials and the quai
were not very easy

  it is extraordinarily hard for terres-
trials reared in the severely practical com-
mercialized thinking of ancient rome to
understand a society footed in a world
that never knew rome thinking con-
tacts might have proved literally impossi-
ble if it had not been for the dvahnyan

  it seems commentary enough on the
problems of cooperation to point out that
eccentrics like crazy joe appeared to find
the quai and the dvahnyan far easier to
understand than normal terrestrials could
wandering subnormals like crazy joe are
inevitable in any frontier society which
attracts misfits by its lawlessness and
wrecks them by its ruthless inflexibility

but it was in great measure thanks to the
crazy joes of the terrestrial highway
towns that a rough sort of working har-
mony had been achieved between the peo-
ples of the neighboring worlds they
were cousin races at least children of
sister planets and sprung from human
stock but oh the differences in their
thinking

  behind rohan forsythe spoke in a low
voice

  wed better go back red he means
business you know you cant kill a
dvahnyan its been tried i dont want
any part of this im going back his
boots grated on the cavern floor as he
took a step forward rohan swept him
back with an outstretched arm

  were going he said aloud in his
pleasantest voice hand me my pack
forsythe were going but in his mind
above the seething of controlled anger
he was saying oh no not this time
i gave in once but not again this time
the risks worth anything i have to do
oh no we wont go back

he shouldered his pack

and stepped through the veil of
dripping water out of the cave the
dvahnym uttered a sudden sharp hiss and
the four quai unexpectedly shivered and
drew back some heavy burden of aware-
ness seemed to come over them and the
four slumped inside their wrappings it
occurred to rohan suddenly that they
must be prisoners-the dvahnyans pris-
oners for some obscure quai crime the
dvahnyan hissed again without seeming
to move a feature the quai bent their
heads and filed on across the clearing a
billow of mist rolled out to meet them and
they plodded into it and vanished the
last to pass turned one bright anguished
hopeless glance toward the terrestrials
then let his third eyelids film across the
look and the mist swallowed him up like
death itself

  rohan felt a sudden burning contempt
for them how spinelessly they gave in
to the dvahnym four against one and
never dreaming of resistance it was the
way on venus but it was not rohans
way
	planet stories

  forsythe shrugging his pack into place
stepped out past rohan

  you were a fool he said disagree-
ably to think you could get away with
this if barbers ship came down right
now i wouldnt get aboard i dont trust
you rohan youre crazier than crazy
joe he scowled and turned to the
dvahnyan will you guide us back
he asked we were fools to come id
have left long ago if id known the
way

  the dvahnyans slanting forearm with
the enigmatic threat of the half open palm
moved in the direction the quai had van-
ished forsythe grunted and stepped down
onto the path jellaby awkwardly crad-
ling his blaster in one arm lumbered after
rohan did not move

  the dvahnyans cool implacable gaze
rested upon him lightly he lifted the
threatening hand higher there was no
way to know what weapons he had-a
flick of the finger might annihilate them
all

  rohan looking into that expressionless
face deliberately let his banked anger
rise this was the turning point in his
life on venus he thought give in now
and wind up like crazy joe face the
dvahnyan down and the treasure on the
mountain would buy an empire it might
even buy the power to crush the dvahn-
yan forever and he knew that an em-
pire would be valueless if he failed to
crush them he knew suddenly that it
was neither the empire nor the treasure
he yearned for now-it was the ruin of
the whole dvahnyan clan the thousands
of dead-faced replicas of the single
dvahnyan before whom a planet humbled
itself confidence and power surged up in
rohans mind he could do it he knew
he could do it-if in this single showdown
he could outface the dvahnyan

  he saw forsythe striding down the path
toward the oncoming billows of mist which
had already swallowed the submissive
quai jellaby paused uncertainly looked
after forsythe looked back at rohan

  rohan drew a deep breath there was
only one way to conquer now had any-
one ever really killed a dvahnyan had
anyone before now dared try why

not he thought what have i got to

lose

  he dropped his hand to the blaster at
his side tipped the holster up and fired
very quickly not drawing the gun not
giving the dvahnyan any warning or him-
self time to think

this was a nightmare ro-
han thought they were running
running running the three of them
through mist and pale trees wreathed in
vines and fog and the leaves talked con-
tinuously around them trembling like a
jungle in terror

  rohan could scarcely see the pale fol-
iage before his eyes that flash back
there- had been so nearly blinding   

  what flash

  oh yes he thought casually the
flash when i shot the dvahnyan

  reason suddenly took over in his spin-
ning mind and he seemed to be screaming
a shocked and incredulous question at
himself shot the dvahnyan i shot the
dvahnyan

  he stumbled and fell forward clasping
a tree-trunk to break the fall and leaned
there for a long moment his cheek against
the wet bark water dripping down his
neck from the trembling foliage above
while he wrestled with his own stunned
and awakening memory

  i shot the dvahnyan  he told him-
self carefully oh yes i did it i red
rohan shot a dvahnyan and here i am
alive so it can be done i did it but
what happened then why am i here

  his memory did not want to retrace its
path and he set his teeth and forced
his mind back to the moment before
the cave when the gun jolted in his hand
and-

  the flash the blinding sun-flash yel-
low white the brightest light that had
ever burned on venus no venusian ever
saw the sun even the fires burned lav-
ender even gun-fire flashed pale violet
but this flash had been the color of the
sun blinding stunning the eye and the
mind

  it engulfed the dvahnyan and the
mist rolled forward to cloud the sun-
color rainbows he remembered had shim-
carry me home

mered for an instant in the mist surely
the first rainbows that had ever shone
on venus

  but had the dvahnyan fallen no man
could stand against the discharge of a
blaster fired into him from three feet
away but was the dvahnyan a man
he asked himself the question and the
garrulous leaves whispered all around him
giving no answer there was no answer
there was only the blinding flash the
mist the rainbows and-

  and then they had run

  forsythe rohan called his voice un-
steady above the conversations of the
leaves forsythe jellaby

  dark figures looming up out of the
trees behind him gasped and slowed in
their forward plunge

  red forsythes uncertain voice in-
quired red

  all right rohan said forcing his
tone toward normality all right calm
down now were okay everythings un-
der control

  control forsythe said bitterly lean-
ing against a tree and gasping for breath
oh sure everythings fine you shot a
dvahnyan i saw you do it you know
what the penalty is for that

do you  rohan managed a wry grin
nobody knows maybe nobody ever
tried it before maybe its a brand new
crime but theyll work out some punish-
ment to fit it and we-

  shut up rohan said he was striv-
ing hard to regain his lost composure he
said again shut up forsythe and his
voice was almost pleasant whats done
is done now youll have to come along
with me if we reach the mountain we
wont have a thing to worry about i
promise you that

  i wont do it forsythe said still
breathing hard im going back and wait
for barber you got the message to him
and i think hell come we didnt give
him time enough thats all he-

  rohan said wearily barbers dead
forsythe he died two years ago

there was a dreadful silence
among the three men for a very
long moment then jellaby slowly un-



slung his rifle his big hands moving al-
most unguided his eyes beginning to burn
upon rohan

  dont you do it rohan said im
your only chance

  barber-dead forsythe echoed blank-
ly i dont believe it youre lying
you-

  i lied before yes i had to i needed
you two rohans voice was assured
gently urgent no message ever went
through to barber because it couldnt i
havent got any pipeline to hell barber
lived a long nasty life and he died in a
crack-up in the jungle two years ago
i heard about it from crazy joe i was
afraid you might have too but i took
the chance i had to i tell you if we
get to the mountain youll never regret
what ive done well be so rich no gov-
ernment can stop us well carve an em-
pire out of the venusian jungle and well
be three emperors who rule half a world
theres enough for all of us this whole
planet is just lying here waiting for men
like us to take over i know the way to
do it im going on i need your
help and ive made sure youd have to
give it you cant go back now the whole
planets against us all we can do is push
on toward the mountain and if we get
there we can buy and sell the world
he elbowed himself away from the tree
im going on you can follow if you
want to

  the two in the path looked at him word-
lessly rage and terror stopping up their
mouths forsythe choked a little and tried
to speak but the words died and his eyes
went suddenly round showing a circle
of white around each iris he was look-
ing back the way they had come

  rohan swung about and looked too dis-
tinctly in the murmuring silence they all
heard the crunch of soft feet moving over
pebbles rohan thought violently back
along the way he had come searching for
a memory of crossing pebbles he looked
down his feet were dark with moisture
yes a broad shoal of pebbles and then
a rushing brook that wound through the
trees a long way back he couldnt re-
member

  they heard pebbles roll and crunch far
planet stomues



off hidden among the leaves then there
was the sound of rapid water gurgling
around an obstruction-such an obstruc-
tion as wading legs pebbles crunched
again on the nearer bank after that si-
lence

  it might be farther than it seemed sound
carried strangely sometimes among these
deflecting leaves

  rohan sucked in breath settled his pack
with firm decisive hands checked his blas-
ter

  come along he said and his voice
was almost cheerful again the pressure
of danger was like a strong drink to him
now there could be no hesitating no un-
certainty the only course was forward
come on-quick we can make it if we
keep ahead

  ahead of what forsythe whispered
rolling his white-ringed eyes back toward
the mist-hung jungle they had passed
its hhfi you know i-ive been seeing
flashes of black through the leaves hes
after us hell get us red we killed him
and hell follow us till he gets us red

i-

  rohans big hand cracked sharply
across the swarthy sweating face

  shut up and get going ahead of me
jellaby you too i dont trust you behind
me go on-march he laughed on a
note of exhilaration ill come last so
if he catches us ill be the first to go

  uncertainly on hurried stumbling feet
the two plunged ahead of him rohan
drew another long breath grinned let it
out in a melodious whistle the tremb-
ling pale leaves conversing all around
them shivered to the notes of defiance in
his voice as he began to sing

  svring low he sang to the mist and
the vine-wreathed trees sweet chariot
cornin for to carry me home  

the mountains tremendous shoul-
ders loomed above the mists mon-
strous streaming with veils of cloud
naked above the clinging jungle it was
gray scoriac stone smudged all up and
down its sides with great soft blurs of
color where lichens grew pink and amber
pale green dusky blue the peak was

hidden the pool the treasure the secret
drew cloud about themselves and pretended
not to exist at all

  rohan looked up at the peak warmly
and lovingly hardly believing he stood
here so close to the goal that would make
all his dreams come true he saw the
steep road winding upward and half shut
his eyes picturing himself coming down
it laden with treasure with rubies and
diamonds and wiser than the rohan who
stood here at the edge of the jungle he
would be stronger than the dvahnyan
when he came down that road a rohan
would come down who knew the secret
of the dvahnyan who held a whole planet
in submission it would be rohan who
gave the orders then

  he glanced back the following feet
still came on they had seen nothing
through the whispering leaves all the way
but the follower had not faltered nor
had he tried rohan thought to overtake
them it had been enough to follow ro-
han knew he ought to feel frightened
forsythe and jellaby were cold and shak-
ing with long-sustained superstitious dread
as they looked back but rohan felt so
sure of the secret which was almost in
his grasp that fear did not touch him
by the time that unhurrying follower
caught up with him he would know more
than the dvahnyan knew he would be
stronger than the dvahnyan if he hurried
now

  all right he said get along up
the mountain boys i promise you once
we-

  listen forsythe said they stood
frozen the jungle babbled with mind-
less lisping voices a wind sighed down
from the heights above somewhere far
off thunder rolled and then the sound
came again hollow and thin distorted by
the leaves between

  ro-han the voice was calling ro-
han red ro-han

  this time a cold shiver went sharply
down rohans back

  go on he said up the mountain
quick

  the voice called again miraculously
nearer the follower seemed to be com-
ing after them now in seven-league boots
carry me home



  ro-han rohan  

  rohan broke into a leaden run the
pack bumping on his shoulders the
mountain was so near if he could get
even a little way ahead perhaps-
rohan the voice said from the edge
of the trees rohan wait for me

  he turned in spite of himself then he
let his breath out in a long foolish gasp
and said crazy joe

  the old man grinned at him above the
ragged heard sure its me what did
you think wait a minute

  he came striding confidently across the
moss swinging his arms he was a stal-
wart old creature no one knew how old
or how young the bleached beard and
hair might be white with age or from
some more obscure reason nobody knew
much about crazy joe except that he came
and went when he felt like it and an-
swered no questions his face was ex-
traordinarily bland and peaceful he did
a great many very odd things at odd
times and it was probably quite true that
he was mad

  he looked immaculate which was an
unexpected part of his eccentricity his
blue jeans were spotted with dew and
rain but he wore them tucked neatly
into the tops of wrapped quai sandals
and his denim shirt was government issue
designed at swanport for terrestrial wear
on venus he had stuck a pink flower in
its pocket-flap and he was probably not
aware that several spotted blossoms and
a pale butterfly rested on his tousled hair

  thought id get here first he said
grinning his rather foolish grin you
must have come fast he tilted his head
back and peered up the steep road that
wound about the mountain well well
he said softly hasnt changed at bit
which one of you plans to go up first
forsythe said unsteadily ignoring the
question was that you behind us all the
time there wasnt-anybody else

  i dunno just what you mean son
crazy joe said blinking

  was there a-did you see any- for-
sythe could not quite get the word out

  a dvahnyan rohan said it for him
we think one of thems after us joe
see anything

grazy joe turned and looked
thoughtfully at the jungle running
his fingers through his beard the pale
butterfly struggled furiously and freed it-
self blew away on a soft gust of wind

  he followed down the labyrinthine
ways crazy joe murmured of my own
mind

  what forsythe asked impatiently

  crazy joe shook his head and his grin
was vacant which one of you plans
to go up first he asked again

  well all go of course rohan said
what about that dvahnyan joe

  if he wants you hell catch you joe
said i wouldnt worry if i were you
there was a band of angels cornin after
me he smiled at rohan i heard a lot
of singing about em you going up first
rohan you cant all go together you
know thats against the rules

  rohan made an impatient gesture i
make the rules from now on whos go-
ing to stop me theres nobody up there
is there

  oh yes one quai always waiting

  what for 

  waiting to be devoured crazy joe
said casually by the thing in the pool
you knew the treasure was guarded didnt
you 

  forsythe looked at rohan expectantly
rohan looked away and met jellabys
tense gaze on the other side the two men
spoke simultaneously

  so thats it forsythe and jellaby
said with a single voice

  rohan laughed not what youre
thinking no ill dive for it if youre
afraid to i never said it would be easy
but youll have to help if somebodys
standing by with a gun ill feel a lot-

  no rohan crazy joe said earnestly
you cant do that you know only one
at a time think it over rohan remem-
ber whats up there the eyes under the
faded bushes of brows were keen that
you wont discover unless youre alone

  whats all this forsythe demanded

  its a secret crazy joe said chil-
dishly rohan knows he glanced back
at the shivering jungle and his voice
blended with its dreamlike soughing be-
hind the vats of judgment brewing he


planet stories

said thundered and thick the brimstone
snowedhe looked at rohan and smiled
he to the hill of his undoing    pur-
sued his road  

  ah youre two crackpots together
forsythe said turning abruptly away his
face was thoughtful he seemed to be
evolving some new idea and that rohan
could not-dared not-allow there was
again as always only one solution

  rohan stepped back from the little
group laying a hand on his holstered gun
tipping it up ominously he would not
have to draw it he could shoot well
enough at this range from the holster it
was a trick he liked

   all right forsythe he said not troub-
ling any more to make his voice cheerful
or pleasant jellaby over here both of
you well go up together you two first
crazy joe-

  he looked speculatively at crazy joe
he wasthinking that he would have to
kill the old man sooner or later he was
dangerous on too many counts he could
lead the two others back to the terres-
trial highway and only fear of the jun-
gle kept them submissive to rohan now
with crazy joe for a guide they would
be free of him also crazy joe knew
too much about the mountain what he
had babbled once he might babble again
and rohan did not intend for anyone else
to stand where he stood now he fingered
the trigger meditatively hesitated de-
cided the moment was not yet crazy
joe he said get back and dont bother
me i make the rules from now on
forsythes heavy face wrinkled up in
a thoughtful grimace rohan didnt like
it he jerked the holstered gun threat-
eningly

  forsythe- he said

  forsythe squinted at him lifted his up-
per lip and laughed harshly

  crazy joe he said without taking his
eyes from rohans is there another path
down this mountain

  only this one crazy joe said tran-
quilly

  no other way to get down

   no its all precipices except this side
where the road is

  forsythe still holding rohans gaze

stepped back deliberately found a con-
venient rock and sat down laughing his
annoying harsh laugh his eyes small and
full of malice on rohans

  go on he said goadingly why
dont you shoot

  jellaby barked out a sudden under-
standing burst of amusement

he wont he declared not him
why wont i  rohan demanded
struggling hard to keep his anger in check

   because you need us thats why for-
sythe said flatly and we dont need you
you wouldnt have let us in on this at
all if one man could have made that trip
through the jungle alone you needed us
when you come down the mountain
loaded with jewels youll need us worse
than ever all right you tricked us into
coming but it was your idea not ours
you go right ahead and wrestle with your
devil-fish up there if you get the treasure
fine well share it with you if you dont
come down thats fine too crazy joe
will guide us back suit yourself red
you asked for it

  we didnt shoot any dvahnyan jel-
laby added were clear well help you
carry your rubies and diamonds back but
we wont get em for you

  rohan looked at crazy joe the old
man smiled impersonally

  one at a time rohan he murmured
thats what i said it isnt allowed any
other way even if you shot me it wouldnt
make any difference youll have to go up
alone

the steep stone road curved
around a leaning monolith and wind
poured downward along it like a stream
of cool invisible water below through
gaps in the mist the trembling jungle
showed stormclouds hung purple and
laced with distant lightning rohans feet
as he climbed left stains of pale green
and pink and violet on the road the colors
of crushed lichens

  he could not see the men below any
longer he knew what they were think-
ing though he knew what they were
planning for he would plan identically if
the situation were reversed forsythe and
jellaby did not mean to risk the ascent
carry me home



  but when he came down loaded with
  jewels they would shoot him as he came
  or try to

he thought of crazy joes mild wit-
x less gaze watching him up the road until
mist blotted the lifted faces out he
thought of crazy joes voice babbling old
poetry

    oh youth that would attain

on for thine hour is short

    it may be thou shalt gain
         the hell-defended fort  

    he laughed a little he felt very sure
  of himself continents of cloud rolled be-
  neath him like the planet he was going
  to conquer when he had conquered the
  mountain it was odd how sure he was
  of the treasure and the secret that would
  make the dvahnyan vulnerable to him he
  had only a madmans word for it and
  yet he was very sure indeed the breath
  burned in his chest not wholly from the
  climb he was brimmed with excitement
  dread a fierce anticipation crazy joe had
  been right after all-he had to be alone
  at this climax of his life he must stand
  or fall by his own efforts but he would
  not fall

    the road turned sharply he had reached
  the top

    he stood quite still looking about him
  with narrowed eyes whistling through his
  teeth without being wholly aware of it
  sweet chariot he whistled coinin for
  to carry me home

   there was an island in the sky a
  walled island with a wide wide gate like
  no gate he had ever seen before through
  the strange lacelike meshes of it he could
  see the fiat summit of the mountain in a
  gray light that cast no shadows a windy
  whispering sighed across the plateau the
  scene was as still and colorless as a steel
  engraving except for the startling blue of
  the pool crazy joe had not lied it was
  sky-blue on a world that had never seen
  the sky thirty feet across lapping level
  with the smooth rim around it colored
  like eternity the pool lay waiting him

    he stood on the lip of a wide stone
  semicircle with the wall beyond it against
  -planet stories-november

the wall facing him was a rickety structure
like something you might see in a bazaar
near the mediterranean back home on
earth a roof of tree-fronds on unsteady
poles leaned against the wall sheltering
a fantastic clutter of objects beneath its
dripping eaves the hut was a jackdaws
nest of junk lying motionless in a huddle
of fringed blankets on the ground a quai
slept placidly

  waiting to be devoured crazy joe had
said

  rohan looked curiously over the bazaar-
booths contents taking an inventory of
the trivia in a quais life that had seemed
important enough to bring with him to
the hour of his death surrounded by the
detritus of his incomprehensible venusian
life the man slept on he lay on his face
and only the pink soles of his bare feet
were visible beneath the tumble of blan-
kets his hands were clasped together on
top of his seal-sleek head

  above him fringes and braided ribbons
fluttered from pins on the wall there
was a wire cage with a captive insect
like a moth crawling about inside chirp-
ing softly a chain of bells hung from
a carved globe of deep red wood there
were three totally incoherent paintings
in irregular frames a whistle hung by a
long tassel a pot of water held three
colorless flowers each with two petals
creased down by a careful hand

  rohans feet did not make a sound on
the rock but he was aware after a moment
that a round yellow eye had opened in
the shadow of the quais uplifted arm
and was regarding him without expres-
sion the quai did not move

  rohan shrugged a little and went on
toward the gate

the wall was high and very
thick so thick that the gate aperture
was really a passage about twenty feet
long the gate itself was a web which
entirely filled the passage from end to
end some spider who spun glittering
curled metal thread had been at work
here it reminded rohan of something
what  curled threads-yes like the
threads woven into the wrappings the
dvahnyan wore his heart beat a little
faster in triumph at this implied con-
firmation of crazy joes promise

  how you passed the gate was another
matter he squinted up at the wall far
too high to scale he glanced back at the
quai and saw that the man was now sit-
ting up cross-legged clasping his ankles
and watching rohan without expression
he was a little struck by the quais face
arrogance was on it this was a man who


had wielded much power over a long
period of time the set of the mouth
showed it and the imperious gaze how
strange that such a man would forsake
life among his people and climb the moun-
tain with his few small valued things to
bear him company until the summons
came   

rohan looked back at the gate this
time it seemed to him that there was an

the road turned sharply
he had reached the top
cj

t-

or

opening which led a little way into the
web like the entry into a maze he put
out a cautious hand tested the firm
curled lace of the metal found a vacant
space the size and shape of a man stepped
forward into it

  he stood there peering intently before
him searching for the next open space
he was certain that it existed but he had
to keep his mind firmly fixed on the
patterns to find it wind blowing through
the gate sang faintly among the webbings

after a moment rohan saw the next
opening squirmed to the left squeezed
between vibrating traceries of bright wire
and stood in another open space several
paces inside the gate

  it was certainly he thought a machine
some intricate venusian mind had built
it for some purpose no terrestrial was
likely to understand but it was definitely
a functioning mechanism it took the most
intent concentration to find ones way
through and the moment the mind re-


	planet

laxed the gate began to press the in-
truder back toward his starting point
gently resiliency almost imperceptibly

  rohan pushed ahead paused for long
minutes searching the dazzling confusion
before him until suddenly the right per-
spective took shape and he saw the next
passage opening clear and unbarred lead-
ing another three feet or so into the tangle
when he stepped into it the way he had
just come blended instantly into the laby-
rinth suddenly frightened he searched
for the way back found it after a few
minutes and discovered he had lost the
forward way while he hunted again for
it he was aware of the pressure of the
web of bright curled wires moving past
his face the gate was pressing him toward
its outer surface

  resolutely he fixed his mind on the
immediate problem found the way for-
ward pushed into it paused searched
again veryslowly he made his way
toward the plateau on the far side of the
wall the pool lay placid waiting

fts this all he thought

  a looking around the empty mountain-
top only the wet sighing wind hissed
in his ear for answer it was all the en-
circling wall hid nothing bare stone over-
grown with blurs of colored lichens and
the pool itself an unlidded eye staring
up at infinity

  rohan strolled toward it paused on the
brink looking down

  his heart turned over

  this much at least of crazy joes tale
was true there were stars down there in the
deep sky-blue of the water stars that
winked up green and red blue and amber
great drifts of jewels set and unset
thicker than the sands of the pools floor

  then a shadow stirred deep down a
vast thick coil moved upon itself turned
over slowly settled back to rest it was
only a part of a vaster shadow he leaned
to peer closer but the water was milky
he could not see  -

  not very much is really known about
the fauna of venus terrestrial explora-
tion has been confined to narrow corri-
dors and if there are dangerous beasts

stories

in the jungles they generally shun the
highways and the towns what may dwell
in the seas of venus is as unknown as
the deepest secrets of our own seas this
thing was vast and sluggish dimly gleam-
ing where light struck it strongest ro-
han measured its bulk as well as he could
considered it with a sort of reckless cau-
tion it was slow it was probably not
hungry or the quai outside the gate would
not be waiting there presumably some
kind of summons would come when the
quai was wanted or did they operate
on some private schedule of their own
at any rate rohan was a strong swimmer
also he had a knife

  he thought unfastening his shirt ifj
i can get up only a load or two of whats
down there itll be a start i can hire
a ship and come back here with enough
artillery to kill the thing and clean out
the pool maybe i wont even wake it up
if im careful

  then he thought of the dvahnyan and
glanced again rapidly and with uneasi-
ness around the plateau had crazy joe
told three truths and one lie about this
place the pool was blue as he had said
it held treasure and a monster of some
kind but the greatest treasure the secret
behind the dvahnyan-where was it  what
was it no crazy joe did not tell lies
unless it was unwittingly could that be
it some vague fantasy he had dreamed
up here staring into the hypnotic eye of
the pool no for he did know the secret
he did talk with the dvahnyan easily
with strong influence sometimes well
never mind at least the jewels were
here after that there would be time
enough to explore further

  a curious sureness drove him on the
secret was here he could see no tangible
evidence but something deeper than rea-
son told him crazy joe had not misled
him in its own time the secret would
come to him as it had come to crazy joe

  he stepped out of his trousers settled
the long knife on its thong around his
wrist poised on the pools brink

how soft and smooth tke
water was not like real water
stroking strongly downward rohan mar-
carry me home



veled at the texture of the blue infinity
he sank through he kept his eyes open
enjoying the deepening blueness watch-
ing for the flashes of color that struck
upward like some sunken autumn from
the bottom of the well it was like swim-
ming through blue air toward stars
he felt happy and light it was strange
to think how intimately he shared this
water with a monster whose shape and
nature he did not know the water was
full of death but he did not fear it it
was full of life and light too if a man
had the courage to reach for them

  the jewels lay heaped in thick bright
hillocks unevenly on the sand it seemed
to rohan that they lay smoothest in a
broad path across the pools center as if
-something-had dragged a wide track
across the treasure many times but the
deep waters hid all sign of the dweller
here perhaps it slept perhaps it had
withdrawn

  rohan shook out the strong light sack
he had brought for the treasure it
wrapped itself around his arm clinging
like seaweed he reached for a heavy
half-submerged outcropping in the sand to
hold himself down and found he was
gripping a carved figure studded with
slippery gems it served the purpose

  what a lot of the treasure there was
he thought warmly riffling it over with
his free hand big rubies like blood-drops
strings of half dissolving pearls linked
diamonds set in imperishable yellow gold
corroded boxes spilling out colored drifts
of stones little idols with enormous emer-
ald eyes ivory furred with the swaying
green hair of water-growths steel mir-
rors pitted with corruption that had once
given back the yellow-eyed glances of
pretty quai girls corruption now them-
selves steel daggers dissolving off studded
gold hilts so much of it too much rich-
ness pressed down and running over

  happily rohan brushed the surface un-
covering yet more treasure underneath
working fast he sorted out the largest
and the best and thrust them into his sack
great pale-eyed diamonds globes of pre-
ciousness as live as stars strings of lus-
trous rainbow color faceted drops of
congealed brightness it was wonderful

it was christmas morning it was easter
with all the dazzling eggs nested here
awaiting him

  his lungs began to burn he turned
over and shot up through paling blueness
toward the air his heavy sack trailing
he began to lauijh exultantly just before
he broke the surface and hung sputtering
and choking for a while before he emptied
his jewels on the bank and dived again

  the treasure flashed brighter than be-
fore he dug into it tossing it over and
over filling the sack anew with the power
and the glory of a planet a second time
he rose to the surface emptied his bulging
sack dived

  this time he uncovered a drift of pure
crimson drops like a man unearthing a
vein of clear gold in a mountain of crys-
tals and silver he dug with both hands
into the rich heaps blinking in the clouds
of sand his digging had dislodged reach-
ing for the bigger and brighter jewels
which always lay just an arms length out
of his grasp

  a long slow coil of disturbed sand rose
out of the milky distance past his face
the water stirred deeply and slowly

  then with great deliberation a grasp
like marble closed around his ankle

rohan writhed over in the

water convulsively letting the rubies
fly they sank in a sluggish red rain
about him through the blue water turning
over slowly as he tugged in a moments
almost fatal panic at that relentless coil
it was heavy and hard and cold like
stone and it was drawing him in   

  it did not seem possible to him that
a slow sun was beginning to burn through
the clouds of blinding sand which he was
raising in his struggles he thought wildly
that the light burned in his own mind a
symbol of shock and fear but the tentacle
drew him downward and inward toward
the light and as it grew and broadened
with nearness it was the color of the sun
itself clear bright white gold shimmer-
ing in the waters that were colored like
the blue skies of earth blue skies and
sunlight-two things no eye upon venus
had ever seen except perhaps here

stories

  his lungs burned his vision blurred
with sand and water and terror he was
not aware of himself as a reasoning crea-
ture at all in this moment he was only
a wild struggling thing frantic to escape

  the thong-hung dagger following his
flailing motions faithfully struck his palm
finally and brought reason back his fin-
gers closed and with his last conscious
strength he drove the dagger down hard
into the murk where the sunlight burned
into the heavy coil that was creeping
higher around his ankle

  he felt the whole coil flinch he
slashed again the water churned and the
marble grasp slackened a little writhing
double blind with light and darkness he
stabbed once more into solid flesh which
he could not see and this time the heavy
coil relaxed and slid slowly slowly away

  rohan shot up through foaming water
luminous water that boiled with sand and
sparkled with broken reflections from that
strange sunlight which burned at the bot-
tom of the well he broke the surface
with what seemed his last despairing ef-
fort and hung there clutching the stone
rim his body swinging helplessly in the
churning water wondering how soon the
coil would rise again and lay its marble
weight around his legs

  a hand seized his wrist two hands
without looking up he made feeble climb-
ing motions against the side of the pool
but it was the strength of the two pulling
hands that saved him he stumbled gasping
and choking over the edge at last onto
dry pavement and lay there spent for
an unmeasured space of time

when breath and volition
came back to him he opened his
eyes and saw a pair of white sandal-
wrapped feet on a level with his face a
tumbled heap of jewels kicked this way
and that between them slowly as ex-
haustion ebbed a little out of him he
pushed himself up until he was sitting be-
side the flashing heap of his treasure look-
ing into the face of the standing man
imperceptibly he was working the dagger
forward around his wrist so that his fin-
gers could close on it

  the quai was not looking down at

him he knew the arrogant face but its
arrogance was not for him the quais
third eyelids were drawn across the round
eyes and their gaze was focused remotely
beyond rohan and downward into the
pool automatically rohan turned to fol-
low that veiled gaze

  he had not imagined the light in the
pool it burned stronger now very bright
very clear and the water was troubled
from deep underneath a sudden turbu-
lence rushed up subsided rushed higher
spilling blue trickles over the rim then
a great bubble rose and burst and just
under it the shining light came floating
up up from the bottomof the well and
the center of the world a cold still bril-
liance that dazed the eye

  the quai spoke in a hushed voice

  were you summoned he asked ro-
han

  summoned rohan echoed the ques-
tion blankly then a little of his old con-
fidence came back and even in the face
of this uprising mystery from the pool
he found himself laughing summoned
oh no-i came

  the two men looked at each other for
a measuring moment even through the
veiling lids rohan saw the cold arrogance
in the quais eyes and knew it for a re-
mote echo of his own but there was a
difference   the quai had come humbly
acolyte and sacrifice in one rohan
laughed again and scrambled to his feet
exhaustion still weighted him but he
could not rest-yet

  what was going to happen next he had
no idea he only knew that he could deal
with whatever came

  his discarded clothing lay beside the
pool shivering a little in the soft wet
wind that breathed across the mountain
he got quickly into his shirt pressing the
seal-tapes with one rapidly moving hand
while with the other he groped for his
trousers the cloth felt clammy against
his wet skin

  he was buckling the reassuring weight
of the gunbelt around him when the next
great bubble burst another rose after it
and another rohan turned settling the
holster against his thigh the quai stood
motionless with the jewels in a glitter-
carry me home



ing tumble around his feet he too stared
down into the pool the water boiled the
light like the sun rose higher higher   

  out of the seething blue waters lifted
the monstrous head of the dweller in the
well slowly slowly it rose water stream-
ing from its shoulders and over its head
the flat unwavering sun burned cold white
gold shimmering shivering sending out
slow rings of light that eddied and faded
spread and paled to an embracing potency
that was felt but not seen they touched
the mind delicately they touched the
mind   

  what did it look like rohan could not
be sure even while he stared the light
dazed him he only knew the thing was
monstrous mailed and shining it drew
its magnificent length over the verge of
the pool coil by coil before it stealthy
slow tentative as the first light of dawn
moved the rings of expanding radiation
the thoughts of rohan and the quai
moved out from their skulls in measur-
able waves from each thinking brain and
the radiations from the flat white light
met them and moved inward as if on
concentric stepping-stones inexorably
toward the center and the source of all
thought

  gently gently but the storm was rising

rohan shut his mind tight

violently rejecting that touch it drew
back slightly puzzled then it came on
again and there were no doors of the
mind he could close against it

  a great many lightning thoughts rip-
pled one after another through his head
the jewels first and last and always the
jewels and how he could hope to get
to them with that monstrous light-crowned
thing rising so slowly from the pool and
how even if he did get them he could
escape for he felt very sure that the
rings of expanding light were quiescent
now barely stirring there was no way
of guessing their full power if the crea-
ture were aroused or how far down the
mountain they could spread burning and
sinking paralyzing the mind

  it was not immortal he had struck it
with his knife and it had let him go cer-
tainly it was not a normal creature by

any terrestrial judgment but it was not
supernatural either he had struck it
and-

  the slow upsurging coils hesitated out
of the water a slash in the mailed side
rose gingerly the creature paused swung
its magnificently  crowned head back to
consider this twinge and rohan knew his
chance   

  the quai never even heard him com-
ing rohans long knife flashed twice in
the quiet air hard accurate blows to
hasten the sacrifice which this man of
venus had come to offer his god rohan
knew what he was doing he knew how
to guide the blows

  it takes perhaps three seconds for ob-
livion to come when you strike deep at
the right spots in those three seconds
the quai had time for one quick look
of blank amazement over his shoulder
and then no more

  rohan was braced to catch the sagging
body before it began to give at the knees
he caught it neatly and strongly over his
bent shoulder letting its weight double
across him and surging forward in the
same quick instant that he stooped

  his timing was perfect when the sun-
crowned head of the monster swung round
again the hurled body of the quai
sprawled limply against its gigantic face
hung there for unmoving seconds and
then slid very gently downward to lie
flat upon the pavement in the pools of
spilled blue water the pools turned red

  rohan wasted no glance at what was
happening between the sacrifice and the
god he was moving with the rapid ac-
curate gestures of an automaton scooping
up gems with both hands dropping them
blindly into his pockets he had hoped
to go down from this pool laden heavily
pack and pockets with treasure but now
he told himself rigidly that he could make
these scooping gestures twice more-once
more-no more-

  resolutely he poured the last double
handful into his pockets and scrambled
backward on his knees ignoring the bruise
and scrape of the stones trying not to
look at the monster and its victim as he
went

  but when he stood panting before the


planet stories

gate he glanced back once for just me
quick curious look before he flung him-
self forward into the slow intricate web
that lay between him and freedom it was
for this chiefly that the quai had had
to die the treasure was only part of it
even if rohan had had time to load him-
self with jewels still a man must die to
give him time to negotiate this gate

  he had one backward look only the
monster had halted half in the pool and
half out of it the great crowned head
was bent and light floated very lazily
outward in slow slow rings the creature
seemed to be inspecting the sprawled quai
leisurely and rohan saw one thing about
it that struck his mind with stunning im-
pact he could not understand this it was
impossible he had assumed all this while
that sacrifices between quai and monster
would be consummated in the time-hon-
ored way-r-that the god would devour its
victim

  but he saw now that the god had no
mouth

the threads of the gateway
shimmered like the intricate arma-
ture-wrapping of the dvahnyan outside
in the leaf-thatched hut where the quai
had slept his last sleep in life the caged
moth chirped with plaintive sweetness
there was no other sound on the moun-
tain but the sigh of the grey wind and
the soft chinking of the jewels in their
pockets around rohans waist

  he went fast down the steep road
he did not know how soon the rings of
light might begin to pulse out and drop
down after him delicately touching the
secret chambers of the mind touching and
pulling him back   

  part of him wanted to be pulled back
for he had accomplished only half his
purpose or had crazy joe lied after all
he had thought that when he came down
this road he would carry a double treasure
-jewels and knowledge something had
gone wrong somehow somewhere tan-
talizingly at the very edge of his mind
wisdom knocked for entry

  the curled threads of the gateway-
the curled threads of the dvahnyans omi-
nous wrappings the gate and the wrap-

pings-each was certainly a sort of un-
earthly machine the latter controlled by
the waves flowing from the strange in-
human brain of the dvahnyan the former
activated and shaped by rohans desire
to enter to pass through or by the mon-
ster

  twice on venus rohan had seen the
sun-once in the crowned monsters bril-
liance once when he shot the dvahnyan
surely the link between the mountain and
the dvahnyan was a strong one but it
was not clear he had missed its signi-
ficance somehow somehow   

  there was not time yet to worry about
it he had the jewels later he could come
back with weapons and reinforcements
and take what he wanted from the pool
if the secret knowledge that could make
all dvahnyan vulnerable was there and
he thought it was he would take that too
at his leisure he could manage every-
thing with what he carried in his pockets

  there was only one last obstacle now
he touched his gun reflectively and
watched the road below forsythe and
jellaby they would be waiting for hint
   no for what he carried to their
minds he knew he himself was only a
vehicle now for the delivery of treasure

  somewhere on the path below they
would meet him to dispute the treasure
he grinned wondering which of them
he would shoot first that it would be rohan
who shot first seemed self-evident to him
and with jellaby-or forsythe-out of
the way the balance would shift once more
and the survivors return to civilization
would depend solely on rohan in the long
jungle trek ahead one man alone could
not make the trip in safety it took two
at least

  forsythe rohan thought if theres
any choice ill kill forsythe

  it was curious in a way how totally
he discounted crazy joe

white fog swam lazily ui
to meet him as he descended look-
ing out over the immeasurable miles of dis-
solving jungle he thought he saw a glitter
of light wink once and vanish very far
away foggy morning flattery swanport
civilization a long way off
carry me home



  the fog closed around him he walked
half blinded in white cloud rocks loomed
like waiting figures at every bend after
a while he drew his gun and carried it
ready the safety off knowing that he
was coming nearer and nearer to the
danger area where almost certain ambush
waited him he went very cautiously now
searching each crevice he passed all his
senses tuned to a singing alertness and
presently with no surprise he heard a
gentle click of metal on rock a little way
ahead in the blankness and knew that the
moment was upon him

  feet shifted on rock a voice whispered
a fierce warning rohan smiled forsythe
first he thought it was bravado and
nothing more he knew he would simply
fire at the first moving shadow and hope
for the best he stood perfectly still
hugging the rock wall his senses straining
into this blank grey world where death
waited him on the downward path

  behind him above him quite clearly
in the fog footsteps sounded

  rohan pressed flat against the rocks
turning his head sharply that was im-
possible

  he told himself that acoustics must be
confused in this heavy blind dimness he
told himself he had imagined the sound
for there could not possibly be footsteps
behind him no one had passed him going
up there was no other way to the top
and he had left nothing alive on the
mountain only the moth in the cage and
the monster in the pool

  but now the sound of footsteps rang
clear again on the rock above coming
nearer it was no trick of the echoes or
the mind someone was following him
down the steep road someone striding
firmly on shod feet that struck loud on
stone and muffled on lichens

  suddenly the mist felt cold around him

  the quai was dead surely surely the
quai was dead but there had been no
other human up there for a disorienting
moment he thought that the man who
strode the path so confidently was him-
self and he who pressed shivering against
the rocks a stranger without a name

  he made himself lean out peering ur-
gently along the way he had come curs-

ing the mist and yet grateful to it for
he was not sure he really wanted to see
the face of this follower at his heels
how confidently the footsteps rang upon
the road how fast they came

   the mists blew thicker still

  the men below him on the road heard
the footfalls now metal clinked on stone
as someone raised a rifle with awkward
haste a voice hissed angrily feet shifted
on pebbles the ambush was ready

  for whom for what

  rohan laid a hand on his heavy-laden
pocket lifted his gun tentatively the
beginnings of panic stirring uncontroll-
ably in his mind in seven-league boots
the following footsteps strode down upon
him

  at the last moment some quick instinct
warned him to clear the path to get out
of the way he flung himself flat against
the high rock wall which was the roads
inner edge

  out of the mists and past him the
dvahnyan stalked his black wrappings
gleamed his empty remote passionless
eyes touched rohan indifferently and
moved away from very far off the im-
personal eyes saw and dismissed him eyes
which held no ego and no consciousness
of self

  but rohan knew the face

  there had been arrogance and pride
upon it like his own the last time he had
looked into it but the man was dead now
he knew that the man had to be dead
with rohans knife-thrusts in him at the
edge of the pool and the monster nuzz-
ling its sacrifice the monster with no
mouth   

  it had received its sacrifice then and
now a dvahnyan came striding strongly
down from the mountain his face stamped
into the same imperishable matrix of self-
less dispassionate calm which every
dvahnyan bore

  stamped-by what

  rohan leaned sick and shaking against
the rock waves of cold revulsion pouring
over him knowing the secret at last so
that was the source of the dvahnyan so
that was what the monster fed upon star-
ing into the lost ghostly erased face of
the dvahnyan he knew why the death-
	planet

dealers of the quai are beings beyond life
and death

  but the two in ambush just below him
did not know rohan held his breath shiv-
ering powerless to intervene in what came
next although he knew to the last spinning
whirl of the brain in his skull exactly what
would come he had been through this be-
fore

  below him he heard the whisper of an
indrawn breath as the dvahnyan strode
by and was swallowed in cloud it was
the inhalation a man takes when he braces
a blaster stock to his hip and holds until
the finger finishes tightening on the trig-
er

  it finished the sharp echoing crack of
gun-fire exploded stunningly in the fog
as jellaby fired at the half-seen stalking
figure which he disastrously mistook for
rohan-

  the fog split and took fire and burned
like the blaze of a white-hot sun the eye
and the mind went blind before it

when rohan could see
again the road was clear before
him jellabys blaster lay abandoned ten
feet below the fog had burned itself
away for a broad half-mile around the
sun-hot flash of expending energy and
time had burned away too how long a
time he did not know

  then scuttling motion far below him at
the foot of the road told him the answer
ten minutes fifteen thirty long
enough for jellaby and forsythe to run
blindly almost to the edge of the pale
garrulous forest at the mountains foot
mindless panic still controlled them and
they ran like little mannikin figures jerk-
ing on strings seen from far away they
ran from no pursuer driven by their
own blind terror

  fontha new-made dvahnyan unharmed
another mannikin far off stalked away into
the jungle at an angle divergent from
theits flight moving steadily upon his own
inhuman business answering some sound-
less call which no human ears could hear
who could guess what summons a
dvahnyan

  you ought to know red a voice
said from very near by

stories

  rohan jumped convulsively glaring how
could he possibly have missed seeing
crazy joe

  the familiar figure leaned against a
rock in full sight six steps away on the
downward path arms folded eyes on ro-
han he was smiling in his bush of beard

  you were thinking out loud red
he said

  rohan laughed shakily his head was
still buzzing and there was a misty dream-
like quality over everything he thought
or did he moved and his laden pockets
jingled faintly thought of the jewels
brought him back to something nearer
sanity and sudden cunning moved in his
mind

  the jewels in the pool were his he
had suffered much for them he would go
on down the mountain catch up with
forsythe and jellaby kill one of them
and travel with the other to safety after
that-time enough to decide but one
thing he must do first crazy joe had talked
too much once already about this moun-
tain and this treasure    now it was ro-
hans and nobody elses forsythe and
jellaby knew they must be silenced
eventually crazy joe had better be si-
lenced too now

  rohan felt for his gun the holster
was empty he looked down in sudden
panic far down the slope pale light glinted
on steel he must have dropped the blaster
when the flash of sun-glare stunned them
all

  he sighed met crazy joes eyes
thought of his knife yes that would do
crazy joe never carried a weapon the
knife would do very well

  there was no use talking about this
crazy joe was smiling at him and he
smiled back automatically and with one
smooth motion drew the knife from his
belt and stepped forward his lips still
curved in the meaningless smile as he
tipped the blade for that fatal spot just
inside the collarbone where life beats so
near the surface that one thrust quenches
it forever in the briefest count of seconds

  moving like a man in a dream he drove
the knife straight home

  how strange he thought remotely that
crazy joe made no move to defend him-
carry me home	

self how irritating that calm smile was

  a streak of jagged lightning sprang up
at the knife-point as it slid across crazy
joes chest not biting in but sliding and
trailing cold fire after it   

  stupidly rohan blinked at the slit shirt-
front and at what he saw beneath the
shirt the tight black wrappings glitter-
ing with curled metallic thread

  from a long way off crazy joe said
quietly this wasnt my idea red on
venus when the summons comes you
go

  was i-summoned rohan whis-
pered and hardly heard the answer be-
cause of the ringing in his ears

  i told you about the mountain didnt
i that was the summons red only
the strong men answer only the men
it can use look up red	

rohan looked up a slow ring
of light was dropping gently down-
ward around the mountain light like
the sun white gold shivering in the dim
air it flickered by rohans face and faded
but another ring came after it stronger
and broader touching the brain as it
passed

  crazy joe still smiling calmly and com-
passionately nodded toward the upward
road

  go on red he said get it over
theres work to be done on venus i
know i do it too you were summoned
go on

  the third ring of light floated down
past rohans face and his mind reeled
in his skull the fourth ring touched   

  suddenly rohans hands rose and
clasped tight on top of his head but
under his defending fingers under the
cuirass of his skull he felt movement
no not movement-light brilliant and
clear white gold like the sun and the
short strong microwaves which the sun
and stars send out even through clouds
even to a world that never sees the sun

  rohan thought quite lucidly for an in-
stant of the sun in a clear blue heaven
warm shining quick nostalgia stirred
in him at the memory of a world called
earth a long way distant dissolving in
space and memory a world called earth

where a man named rohan used to live
a long long time ago

  a man called-what

  he stamped once on the path feeling
rock solid under him searching for re-
assurance in an eclipsed universe there
was a bearded face before him he knew
that face it had always been hauntingly
familiar under the disguising beard and
something more concealing than the beard
-a calm and passionless peace the peace
that comes when a strong ego drains out
and-something else-flows in something
else like light like blazing gold like the
white flame that was stirring in his brain
this time he knew the erased identity
that had dwelt once behind that face

  he said you were barber you were
barber jones

  crazy joe smiled and nodded

  rohans hands clasped tighter on his
head he said painfully and i-im-
but he could not finish he was no
one he had no name at all

  go on back crazy joe said from
infinite distances theres nothing else
left for you now nothing at all

  a ring of clear bright light sank about
him widening and expanding and the
name of rofian faded the name of earth
dissolved jewels clinked as he turned
obediently to face the rising path last
of all the bright thought of power faded
and the use of treasure

  in the emptiness of his mind he searched
remotely for a name that had dissolved
irretrievably in the burning of the light
of his brain and after a moment or two
he seemed to find it d-it began with
d-

  dvahnyan

  he leaned motionless against a rock
for a long time doing nothing once
his lip drew back in a fading snarl of
defiance but then he moved took an un-
steady forward step and then another
back along the way he had come it was
the way he had come all his life toward
this mountain and this upward path

  burning with light and color the jewels
dropped from hi pockets one by one a
he climbed marking the stumbling sta-
tions of his return to the mountain and
the pool and the thing that waited for him
sidewinders from

 sirius 

by fox b holden

the treacherous aliens from outer space gave earth six months
to surrender or be destroyed  t but vice-colonel gaylord
kraut fearless ace of terrestrial intelligence had a daring
plan why not surrender nous

gaylord kram vice-
colonel of intelligence terres-
trial federal government sat pon-
dering one of the worst poker hands he
had ever witnessed and he had witnessed
a goodly number in his  years when he
should have been sweating blood over his
tottering governments most perplexing
problem what to do about the colonists
from sirius and their g-ray

  but what could even a kram do with
two deuces the joker a five and an eight-
spot all of different suits

  the other three intelligence officers who
were taking a little badly-needed recrea-
tion the old fashioned way werent too
surprised when kram raised a thousand
credits there was no sense in trying to
analyze krams poker any more than
there was any sense in trying to analyze
kram he usually won always a diff-
erent technique but he usually won any-
way

  major ignacius luverduk krams
somewhat useful assistant knew this and
folded his lowly hand which consisted
of nothing more than dogs-over

  while he was waiting for the colonel
across from him to up-ship or get off the
runway kram fell to thinking

  xenthl had pulled a dirty one forty



years ago the people of iaaro system
of sirius under the too-able leadership
of xenthl had finally made their pres-
ence known on earth for three cen-
turies they had examined earth from
afar to assure themselves that it would
make a suitable landing spot for awhile
during the mid-twentieth century they
had scared the pants off some people and
incurred the ridicule of some others less
imaginative with their disc-shaped space
and aircraft but that couldnt have been
helped one had to trace a culture a
civilization for a long time before one
could analyze its true character-traits
abilities potentialities especially when
ones forces were few in number and
there were nearly two billion of the other
fellow

  but the people of iaaro had finally
landed back in  satisfied that earth
with its faults was better than more light-
years of space with its uncertainties and
hardships and xenthl had been very nice
about the whole thing

the colonel decided to up-ship
he was new he pushed a moun-
tain of white chips forward ill stay
he said with a tremulous sort of confi-
dence the lieutenant to his right folded
i

stories

and being the dealer gave kramthe two
cards he asked for the joker kram
had decided ought to be kept this once
for a kicker

  ill play these the colonel said in
what he intended to be a convincing tone

  check blind to the pat kram heard
himself saying

 umm five thousand should be
enough

  kram edged his hand open and now
it was his turn to up-ship or the two
twos and the joker had been somewhat
disgustingly joined by a six and a seven

  yes xenthl had been very nice about
it all but then in his position with only
a few thousand followers how else could
he have been conquest and occupation
even with superior weapons would at
any time have been unthinkable force
of numbers alone would have told as
long as earthmen had cannon and air-
craft and mass-murder of earths peo-
ple prior to the planets methodical exami-
nation would have left an immense
empty planet with only a few thousand
of the newcomers to work it

  xenthl had wanted not only a planet
but slaves to work it as well

  so he couldnt kill em off reasoned
kram in the back of his mind for the
millionth time the thing was to use
strategy not arms and xenthl could
have his cake and eat it

  which in six months time unless some-
body probably himself figured out a way
to stop him he would have

  hmm grunted kram knitting his
sleek brows in final appraisal of his hand
your five and my-y-y-seven-fifty
smoothly he pushed a pile of whites into
the center of the polished marswood ta-
ble-not too quickly and not too hesi-
tantly timed just right just the way
xenthl had timed things

  a firm toe-hold on earth that was
first    the promise that if allowed to
colonize all the deserts of the planet his
people would within a few years time
make garden spots of them through their
vastly developed science of hydroponics
they had come they explained seeking
refuge from their own drying planet of
iaaro-they were all that were left all

they wanted was a home and they would
in turn give to the men of earth the
advantages of their advanced learning
and see no weapons

  and that was true they had disman-
tled every defensive weapon they had car-
ried in the disc-shaped spacecraft had
turned the parts and blueprints over to
earth scientists for study

  and they had turned the deserts of the
planet into garden spots save for a few
patches left barren for laboratory con-
struction

  and they had improved the lot of earth-
men in countless ways-philosophically
goveramentally politically educationally
religiously scientifically technically and
so on

  nice kids until they had sprung the
g-ray and shown their true colors and
by that time it was a little too late
even for the men of earth to cuss them-
selves out for having been the most gul-
lible jays in the universe fourth dimen-
sion included while telecrooners were
dripping songs about the delirious gal
from sirius and housewives were listen-
ing to the adventures of the young widow
from iaaro xenthl was quietly setting
about to take over the planet

  and he was doing that too

  you said the colonel as he got off
the airstrip win

kram raked in his loot there was
some deliberation concerning the con-
tinuation of the game idly kram counted
the credits he had bluffed the colonel out
of or which he more than suspected
he had counter-bluffed the colonel out of

  the g-ray xenthl had explained to
the men of earth when he announced to
them that they would be given one year
in which to reorganize their governments
in conformation with his dictates and in
subservience to his rule and under the
sovereignty of himself and his people op-
erated on the practical principles of a
theory once promulgated but never put
to work before his death by an earth
scientist of the th century the earth-
man had called it a general theory of
gravitation the sirians had their own
name for it and when applied in weapon
sidewinders

from sirius



form the result was the g-ray-a wea-
pon capable of completely nullifying the
forces of gravitational cohesion within any
and all molecular structures result  com-
plete and instantaneous disintegration of
any material object solid gaseous or li-
quid at which it was aimed within its
scope the forces of what xenthl termed
molecular gravity fell completely to
zero nothing exploded it just stopped
being all at once

  there had been demonstrations three
demonstrations and the world was more
than convinced

  xenthl had demonstrated his weapon
on three of his own no-longer-needed
laboratories situated in their sterile pat-
ches of blistering desert they had each
covered areas about the size of three
large earth cities with the complete op-
eration telecast to all the world and with
earth scientists watching at respectful dis-
tances in observation posts in one of which
xenthl himself had been present the sir-
ian dictator had given the commands for
his g-batteries to fire they fired at
ranges twice those of earths best
atomic cannon

  the lab-cities each hit with- a single
blast vanished one two three

  the places where the labs had been
were minutely examined by earths men
of science for weeks afterward

  not a trace of anything just sand
the sand xenthl explained was kept
as much below the ray-field as possible
-digging holes for miles into the planet
wasnt after all necessary and it wouldve
wasted power   

  where there may have been signs of
disbelief xenthl had only to infer that
really did the credulous ones of earth
suppose that the lords of iaaro had dis-
closed all their great secrets of science
when they had landed would they have
divulged the very secret of their pro-
posed conquest

  the brave man with the club facing
an enemy with an atomic rifle knows he
is licked at such a point kram reflected
heroism would be a little silly hysterical
anger would be useless

  xenthl and his crowd mused vice-
colonel gaylord kram to himself as he

stretched the zipper on his bulging hip-
pocket are a bunch of sidewinders
the game in which you have been
the only victor is over said luverduk
at his elbow and in your last statement
you are as usual correct but wait until
the old man learns how much time we
killed diddling instead of using the elec-
tro-relaxers

  jupiter damn the laxers-you do
not seem to have perceived luverduk
that i have a theory

the others globular countenance
reflected no particular surprise at this
quiet thunder for to luverduck theories
by kram were things to be taken regularly
for granted monstrous theories which
oddly enough were without exception cor-
rect in every detail when put into actual
practice as kram himself of course
would never fail to make perfectly clear
in the first place that kram was an
intelligence expert with a brilliant back-
ground in weapon design was the fact
however in which the terrestrial gov-
ernment was at present narrow-mindedly
interested

  and it was the fact that had led to
the dumping of the sirian g-ray prob-
lem right in his lap

  unearthing the g-ray secret was krams
assigned mission that made it ignacius
luverduks as well you have a theory
should i take that siriusly ha

  kram only quickened the strides of
his long gaunt legs as they headed for
his office there was not even the quiver
of one long black eyebrow to denote his
having heard luverduks effort

  for a ballistics and weapon-design ex-
pert the wheezing major observed you
kram are at least a devilish poker player
you were bluffing on that last hand ly-
ing in your teeth psychologically speak-
ing you were guilty of the worst sort of
misrepresentation

  foof he was bluffing every bit as
bad as i was worse probably didnt
even have a pair

  you could tell luverduks round
blue eyes became excited for his own
brand of poker left something to be de-
sired in the way of winning money
	planet stories

  when the time comes kram said
that i fail to perceive a bluff and fail
then to call it i will start a mink ranch
on pluto

  no reply luverduk had heard that
pluto was a sterile planet and was a
little puzzled the two strode into krams
office which was empty of staffers it
was laxer time kram started doing the
talking

  you ignacius will deliver a message
for me to sectors-general hoskins in
person kram was writing things on a
memo pad the blanks of which were
stamped confidential at their tops
in big red letters it says iggy that
president thurston is to be informed
that i have unequivocally failed to glean
any information concerning the sirian
secret weapon and in trying further to
do so would seriously imperil whatever
chances earth may have left to escape
total destruction i kram have somehow
failed the message points out in addi-
tion that ive lost seventy-three percent
of my secret operatives already and it
explains that with each additional one
captured xenthls temper is shortening
to the breaking point being slightly par-
anoiac he hates to be crossed hes one
of those egotistical bastards you know 
oh but you cant-

  shuddup it also advises that the ter-
restrial government open truce negotia-
tions for the consideration of terms
you mean youre telling hoskins and
thurston that we should wave the white
flag luverduk paled to the color of
old paste

  you deliver it and- kram kept
writing theres a ps it says that i
personally-that we personally-plan to
request audience with xenthl to open
aforementioned truce negotiations to-
day

  you quavered the major scarcely
above a whisper have cracked up

  we will take off for xenthls moon-
side headquarters at precisely  hours
radiating a truce signal and you will
now deliver this message he thrust the
memo into luverduks wringing hands
and you will return here in exactly 
minutes thats an order

  oh gaylord breathed luverduk
asthmatically oh oh oh   the
length of the corridor down which he
waddled swallowed up the gibberish that
whispered in his wake

thirty minutes to the second
later just as kram was putting the
finishing touches on the thing which he
had estimated would take him precisely
 minutes to rig luverduk returned

  gaylord

  i have something to show you ma-
jor luverduk come here kram ges-
tured toward the outside door of the large
office which led through a space-cruiser
hangar and out to the experimental de-
tonation range where new weapons re-
ceived their first tests in the half-scale
stage

  show me good lord gaylord hos-
kins read it right there in front of me
he said for you to get to his headquarters
as fast as you can double-time it sore
it was more or less nice knowing you
lance-corporal kram

  i knew hed be a little silly about it
at first

  he said if youre not in his office in
 minutes hes coming to yours with
his whole damned guard

  might come to think of it come here
luverduk

 but-

  see this kram held a shiny new
needle-ray pistol in his hand it was
strictly an anti-personnel weapon and
good only for close-in combat a hand
weapon of limited powers and nothing
more

  i see it but as one skeleton in the
museum told the other if we had any
guts wed get out of here  

  follow me

  since it sounded like an order luver-
duk obeyed it kram was not a lance-
corporal yet luverduk followed his su-
perior to one of the firing ranges for
atomic cannon kram pointed to a dis-
mantled space-cruiser hull used regularly
by cannoneer cadets for target practice
its molybdenum hide was scarred with
many accurately-directed blasts it was
sidewinders

nearly a quarter-mile from where kram
stood

  watch he said luverduk sensed an
order in that word also

  kram pointed the pistol potent up to
 yards slowly his long right arm came
up the streamlined weapon glinted in the
afternoon sunlight carefully kram aimed
-aimed impossibly-at the distant cruiser
hull then his finger constricted on the
trigger hiss it went

  and the hull was blasted to atoms 
you- that was all luverduk could
utter he gaped pudgy mouth hanging
open first at the pistol then at the ris-
ing column of white smoke where the
scarred hull had been he knew at the
same time that had it not been for the
shock-wave absorbers covering the range
with their radiations he would at pre-
sent be flat on his face or its reasonable
facsimile

  i kram said am a weapons ex-
pert as well as an intelligence officer
you know that correct

  gurgle

  confronted with the facts luverduk
which you yourself have just witnessed
what would you say

  that pistol is better than the-the
g-ray you-

  i have xenthls skin i expect should
crawl agreed

  luverduk nodded slowly

  good because we are now going to
see him a ship is parked in the hangar
not about that truce business- lu-
verduks voice rose in horror

  precisely

  hoskins luverduks voice was a
challenge to all soprano mice

  umm kram said luverduk fol-
lowed him

  what did they say kram asked
the moon leered at him through the
thick quartz conning-port like a pitted
rotted rubber ball that had once been
painted with a diluted silver gilt

  luverduk still shook but not as much
about those skeletons-

  youll be one if you dont cut your
jets what was their reply

  xenthl will give us an audience upon
our landing but we have been emphati-
cally warned that the slightest move we
make which may be interpreted as a

breach of truce will be our last and
they added that any move made by any-
body else in the neighborhood which may
be so interpreted will be their last
too   

  told you things would work out
work out were only-flying a white

weve only gone awol apd hoskins
is gunning right behind we often leave
without saying good-bye-

  parts of that statement are inaccu-
rate hoskins is waiting at the boundary
not daring to fire into the sirian zone-
not gunning right behind and he knows
that one ship-length of an armed cruiser
over the boundary will mean the g-ray
for the whole shooting-match he also
knows well cofne back so is just stand-
ing by until we do however to some-
thing of far more importance did you
bring the blast-rifle

  i dd- i assume it is like the pistol
only more so

  it certainly is supposed to be
your answer is only more or less
perfect i say again is the rifle like a
super g-ray

  no

  like a super atomic cannon then
no the rifle as well as the pistol i
showed you are to put it vulgarly fakes
they wouldnt squirt water

  i asked you a straight question you
should therefore give me at least the sem-
blance of a straight answer come again
you heard me fakes

  you mean they will not work it will
not work 

  silence

  good lord you mean were actually
going to see xenthl with truce in our
white little hearts and not blow his head-
quarters to pieces this is a real honest-
to-god truce mission

  in a manner of speaking sort of
then the explosion of the space
gruiser hull   

  was faked

  you tricked me

  i did but you believed me until i
told you

  luverduk was starting to hop up and
down although his feet never quite left

the deck i will admit that but only
because its true

  its true all right in addition to be-
ingan intelligence and weapons expert
i am likewise rather clever in the field
of psychology your foreknowledge of my
expertness with weapon design had you
half-convinced i could do something fan-
tastic before you even saw me apparently
do it and when you saw it in what
looked like actuality it was all you
needed

  but we are surrendering anyhow you
are a mad fellow-

  let us not luverduk confuse the
term truce with surrender what i
told hoskins and what i am actually do-
ing are horses one might say of variable
hues 

  you see a way out of this kram
prepare to man the decelerators at
 g on my signal

  as the roar of the forward jets cut
in and krams vision grew momentarily
blurred the suspicion grew in his mind
that luverduk was mumbling something
about northbound horses   

the military headquarters of
xenthl commander-in-chief of the
sirian expeditionary forces and grand
protector of the universe were as kram
would have put it somewhat stupendous
simplicity was the keynote of its other-
wordly architecture the huge hemisphere
of eerily glimmering alloy was first viewed
by luverduk with anything but a narrow-
eyed analytical gaze and its interior al-
though not resplendent in the sense o
the courts of ancient kings was a breath-
stopping spectacle of geometry as could
only have been conceived by minds of
other space the involutions of its eye-
defying curves were as gracefully simple
as they were dimensionally complex the
very straightness of the corridor down
which the procession of heavily armed
guards and the men from earth pro-
ceeded was a masterpiece of structural
design in itself

  xenthls sanctum sanctorum was an
even greater achievement in the architec-
turally impossible kram made a mental
note to make a requisition for a replas-
sidewinders

from sirius



tering job in his own office immediately
upon his return to earth

  luverduk was impressed but more
with xenthls bearded rotund pink-
skinned majesty than with his surround-
ings

   without the beaver hed look just like
me kram

  so he would major

  the seated xenthl signalled his guards
to halt and the envoys of truce to step
forward his oversized cranium typical
of his race seemed to nod gently from
its own weight

  you come he mouthed the terres-
trian language awkwardly as couriers of
surrender 

  you are crazier than luverduk here
if you think so kram casually folded
his arms as a personal represen-
tative of his most excellent sovereign
worthiness the guardian of all univer-
ses in space and time the president of
terra and also the bronx i appear be-
fore you to recognize and return the
civility displayed by your forces in not
attacking an earth ship radiating a signal
of truce in short i am here to offer
you your life and the lives of your peo-
ple with the alternative of instantaneous
annihilation

  i am amused purred xenthl but
at your expense for this impertinence
your government shall be given but one
month more instead of six months more
to prepare itself for my rule and in
addition from this moment forward it
will be under the direct surveillance of
my own armed forces i have it would
seem grossly overestimated the intelli-
gence of you earthmen it had been my
thought that as you say you knew what
was good for you i have erred
that said kram allowing the flicker
of a self-indulgent grin to play at the
corners of his long mouth is some-
thing of an understatement mr xenthl
and to prove what i say-and a man of
your intellect would require proof of any
statement-i ask that the only armament
aboard the ship in which i came a blast-
rifle be brought here to be fired- as i
direct by one of your own marksmen by
directing his aim telescopically he should

have no trouble in sighting on the aban-
doned cruiser hulls which i have had
towed into position for target pur-
poses  

  xenthls mouth worked this is a
trick of some sort he said icily at the
very least a gross misuse of the pur-
poses of truce

  i offer you your lives kram said
almost nonchalantly

  as a man of my intellect- xenthl
declared after a breath-take of hesitation
i require whatever attempt at proof you
may have for your childish statements
guard

within moments the rifle was
in the hands of one of xenthls
marksmen and sighting with a head-
quarters electrono-telescope the soldier
from sirius drew a bead on the drifting
cruiser hulls and pressed the curved trig-
ger at xenthls order

  in a visiplate xenthl himself wit-
nessed an incredible white flash as first
one of the space-cruiser hulls was blown
to atoms and then in rapid succession
the second third fourth and fifth

  you will observe kram said that
only one hull was hit but all were de-
stroyed a little chain-reaction gadget i
developed last week- a gasp at krams
elbow but kram had not finished-you
have observed also he continued matter-
of-factly that with one blast of only
a rifle to say nothing of the cannon i
have also developed a myriad of targets
may at once be destroyed your g-ray
kram adopted a tone dripping with re-
spect is capable after all of destroying
but one target at a time

  xenthls features had lost their healthy
pink tinge you have mastered he said
a practical application of the chain-
reaction principle it is impossible but i
have seen you do it with my own eyes
that was the object in my having
come kram said in his most courteous
tone and it is the proof which i knew
your excellency would demand in addi-
tion to which i might inform you that
i am gaylord kram

  silence then

  this is indeed a matter for some con-
i

planet stories



sideration xenthl said

  and even the mask-like face of the
arrogant sirian was not able to disguise
the look of utter incredulity which was
shadowed beneath its still-white-tiriged
surface	

s  

  kram youll hang for this

  gaylord kram stood at rigid attention
before sectors-general hoskins on the
flight-deck of the general flagship he
had drawn his own craft alongside and
boarded with major luverduk at the gen-
erals command and under the ugly snouts
of the generals artillery

  i trust he said that you will accept
my apology for having issued you a false
communication but i theorized that only
in anger would i be followed so promptly
and with such a show of strength only the
thought of surrender could make you
angry sir

  you impudent puppy you- hoskins
was livid he did not shake he vibrated

  it was necessary sir i was bluffing
but i needed at least the appearance of
armed might to give credence to my strat-
egy i readily admit having rescued our
planet by means of what may unappreci-
atively be termed trickery as i tricked
luverduk here by simply using a mined
target on the-detonation range so i also
attempted to trick xenthl with five un-
manned space-cruisers loaded to the seams
with atomic detonators timed to produce
the effect of chain-reaction and set off
by remote control there was a miniature
radar transmitter of my own design within
the blast-rifle which i had xenthls marks-
man use quite simple really

  simple is hardly the word hoskins
thundered with the sirian g-ray staring
us in the face you- try your hand at strat-
egy i hope there is time to hang you
before earth is blown to kingdom come
never fear sir xenthl had merely
used an innovation of the q-type light-
bender to produce a mirage at the desert
location of his supposed abandoned labor-
atories first the buildings were seen
then at the instant his weapon was sup-
posedly firedthey were not a mirage had
been turned on and off at will that was
all putting it simply sir-i theorized
that the g-ray was in the first place no
more than a colossal bluff itself

  theorized the man says the gen-
erals complexion blended nicely with his
lavender tunic to him politics is five-
card stud to him-

  the tirade was interrupted by a wide-
eyed orderly who bore a signal-technicians
insignia on his sleeve sir sirian ships
are leaving the moon driving- hard past
pluto by the minute sir larger and larger
flights are going up-ship for deep space
and at full drive sir

  of course murmured kram i gave
them twenty-four hours to clear out
deftly mounting a portable g-gun which
he had confiscated from xenthls personal
arsenal kram pointed it directly at his
own ship drifting under robot control a
few miles to the flagships starboard

  they cleared out he declared quietly
because gaylord kram had called their
bluff gentlemen and triumphantly
punched a firing-button

  a soft hiss and krams cruiser was
blown to smithereens

four aarnian criminals -- vi-
cious and deadly-fled silently
into the martian night and
grimly the patrol threw out an
airtight dragnet nothing hu-
man could have escaped    but
whats human about an aarnian

they screamed in a dissonance
of agony and fear and death   

sarah emerged from the
surface of the great canal as sleek
and brown as a seal laughing and
sputtering she jerked her head once over
each round shoulder parting her soaked
hair and revealing her face

  try that once again she flung at
joe

stories

  joe caradac ducked her again and kent
shouted something from the bank that
wasnt quite audible over the squeals and
splashes

  what joe held his wifes head firmly
between his knees whatd you say
kent

  his senior intendants grin widened as
he cupped his hands over it to shout again
i said-youll drown the poor thing
joe grunted as sarah cold-bloodedly lo-
cated a nerve-center in his thigh and bit
it not this thing- he released her
and she bobbed up swearing in sand-coast
martian- they had to rope it out of a
canal to teach it to walk

  he narrowed his grey eyes humorously
and poised for the attack but sarah had
conceded and was swimming toward the
bank the setting sun struck a series of
glowing vs in her wake joe rubbed his
tingling leg and followed they reached
the gfeen slope at the same time and big
kent handed them up with ease

  rays watching the franks he said
and ive been watching ray and i think
wed better get up there or he wont be
able to hold off much longer his inner
man is showing through

the pianists dark saturnine face
peered at them over the fire as they
came up and he rose wiping his hands
carelessly on his sport tunic he had evi-
dently gone into the canal-skimmer and
changed out of his bathing suit

  how do he greeted dourly the
damned thing itched so i took it off

  joe gave himself a last swipe with the
towel and tossed it through the open
hatch of the skimmer sarah carried her
towel into the boat and came out presently
in a suede skirt and bolero looking rubbed
down and delectable joes wife was half
martian and it showed in her long slender
eyebrows and delicately cleft nose and
chin she looked worriedly at the three
men busy with the frankfurters

  theres something on the telaudio she
said come in and listen

  what is it joe asked

  something about somebody escaping
from mars detain

  rays humming stopped hed been

practicing wrist octaves on a flat rock
and his long hand hung motionless for
a moment as if he were reaching for
something kent set his frank across the
top of his coffee cup-he was always
careful about everything-and stood up

  joe looked at his wife looked at her
eyes they were frightened

  thats pretty near here isnt it
sarah said she moved back to let the
three men into the boat they grouped
around the telaudio

  i dont think theres anything to worry
about kent said slowly theyre bound
to catch the men-

  they arent men

  the four listened

  -ruthless aarnians this warning
cannot be taken too seriously detain is
doing everything in its power to recap-
ture the four criminals but as is known
the aarnian psyche is able to leave its
body at will and inhabit the body of
another entity subjugating the mind of
its hos-t and contro-

  my god ray whispered ive heard
of those devils

  -in all likelihood will seek to escape
from mars to prevent this all persons
now holding tickets for interworld travel
must submit to being psycho-screened be-
fore entering liners no more tickets will
be sold-

  sarahs eyes were wide and round
theyd have to leave their bodies behind
-here on mars

  big kent-because he was one of the
caradacs oldest friends and could do
such things - put his arm around her
shoulders and squeezed she was shiver-
ing

  -tenant smith of detain informs us
that the aarnians are unable to pronounce
certain consonantal dipthongs-such asjee
and jay-even if occupying bodies that
can normally pronounce such sounds this
is very important as it may be an only
possible means of identification for the
aarnians will undoubtedly seek new
bod-

  sarah switched off the telaudio her
brown face openly sick she bit her lip
and looked at each of the three men
surrounding her
cargo to callisto



  that gives me the shivers she said
lets go home

  after that they didnt talk much under
the red twilight they packed up the pots
and pans leaving the unwanted food for
the night-crawling noils they spent a lot
of time looking over their shoulders as
they did this although each tried to con-
ceal it from the others at last the skim-
mer moved silently away from the bank
and pointed its nose at the distant haze
that was ofei by the great canal

at precisely seven oclock the
telaudio on the headlxard of joes
bed turned itself on sounds pricked the
balloon of his disturbed slumber tugged
his mind out to wakefulness he rolled
over and sat up listening rubbing his
lanky legs

  instead of the usual symphonic music
he heard an urgent voice obviously ad-
libbing 

  -be very very careful the criminals

-the aarnums-have still not been found
all residents of ofei and vicinity are
warned-this warning cannot be overem-
phasized-

  joe reached out and clicked on the
screen the announcers tunic was wrin-
kled his sash was awry he looked as if
hed been up all night

  -are advised to stay within the city
limi-

  joe snapped off the telaudio and glanced
over at sarahs bed she was snoring deli-
cately one smooth arm pillowing her
mass of blue-black hair better that she
doesnt hear any more about that busi-
ness he decided firmly

  joe liked the simple life no servants
no flunkies although he could have af-
forded a dozen five sunshiny rooms on

the great canal with a nice view of
mars memorial park on the bank oppo-
site he robed himself against the early
morning chill and headed for the kitchen
his head ached faintly and to judge by
what little he could remember of it hed
had a dilly of a nightmare something
about    being chased or something
or smothered by a   

  even as he stopped in his tracks to try
to pin it down the memory broke dis-
solved as if in flight frowning he pushed
through the kitchen door and crossed to
the deep-freeze slid it open and rum-
maged in it

  the nightmare wasnt important surely
but he mulled it over with interest as he
prepared breakfast for joe being rather
well adjusted dreamed rarely and then
mostly about iowa back on earth   
a long-ago picture of a twelve-year-old
boy his first day in college the boy sit-
ting under his shining projector surroun-
ded by a group of thunderstruck psychol-
ogists the quick death of their initial
skepticism and in its place a growing
wonder as it became evident that although
a history spool was whirling in the scan-
ner and the thought-helmet functioning to
perfection the boys mind was receiving
neither spoken text nor images   

  you dont feel anything a psycholo-
gist asked skeptically

  joe closed his eyes there was a low
unmusical humming in his ears and that
was all he tried to shake his head and
couldnt so he said no i dont

 when was the world federation
formed 

  i dont know

  are you lying

  no

  one of the other psychologists standing
	planet stories

nearby looked up from the little box he
held in his hand and said that joe wasnt
lying

  the first psychologist raised his eye-
brows well try another projector
while technicians dismantled joes
projector and examined it for shorts or
haywire the psychologists had joe sit down
under all the other projectors in lsty-
cubicle  then they tried  and 

  its some kind of block the first
psychologist said finally looking profound
to cover up his tizzy theres some kind
of barrier in his mind

  joe caradac clenched his fists thats
not true-i want to learn

  then you probably will boy- the
psychologist sat down to fill in some forms
-but youll have to go back three hun-
dred years to do it youll have to leara
front books

  there the dream would simply end for
no fantasy pf wish-fulfillment could have
exceeded in satisfaction joes actual con-
quest of this problem at eighteen he wore
thick glasses-he preferred them to con-
tacts or artificial irises at twenty he took
tests contrived especially for him by the
members of central education assigned
to his case he was awarded equivalence
degrees in business administration meta-
tomics and interplanetary law his
marks were the highest of the year and
joe caradacs name was briefly in the
newsphones

  he started with the new chicago offi-
ces of mars imports and exports as a
mercury after six weeks of flying back
and forth with memos he traded his anti-
gravs for a desk

  and on june   the newly ap-
pointed regional buyer for m i and e
got married and was flown to mars by
a chartered spacer to take command of
the regional office at ofei by the great
canal   

he was putting the finishing touches
on breakfast when he heard a groan
and the sound of a stretch from the bed-
room when he turned around sarah
was standing in the doorway

  joes sandy eyebrows went up his wife
was certainly not a modest woman but

considering even that this morning was
an agreeable surprise her eyes were
still dull - he guessed that shed wor-
ried about those whatyoucallits after go-
ing to bed - but she was smiling broadly
joe began to have visions of missing work
for half a day he smiled back at her and
she laughed a little

  holm tjarnl she said

  joe was thrusting halved oranges into
the juicer he turned off the machine and
grinned

  youll have to talk plainer than that
little monkey he said he held out a
glass of juice drink this-itll wake
you-up- the last word faded into an
astonished silence

  then joe said hey-come back he
set down the glass and went into the
bedroom

  she was lying on her bed her face
hidden joe dropped onto the edge of the
bed and put a tentative hand on her back

  hey now he said softly if thats
the way you feel about it ill juice up
some grapefruit he moved his hand
down and spanked lightly hein

  she didnt look up she had turned her
head and was looking at the corner of
the room by joes bed

  i do not feel well go away

  joes face was immediately concerned
he bent over her reached for a wrist
whats the matter sarah can i get you
anything the wrist hung limply in his
hand

  no go away

  joe straightened up and drew his eye-
brows together in thought sarah was
usually tearful and pretty much of a
leech when she wasnt feeling well ex-
cessive commiserations and breakfast in
bed were the rule at such times

  do you want me to get doc halprin

  the blue-black head shook from side
to side

  so what am i supposed to do mon-
key i hate to leave you this way

 go away

  but cant i-

  go away damn you

  joe stood up abruptly he clenched his
fists and looked at his wifes still form
and gradually the anger dulled and left
cargo to

him he had no right to be angry every-
body got tempermental once in a while

  but this was the first time she had
ever cursed him

  ok he said softly ill see you to-
night

the regional offices of mars
imports and exports sat upon a
hill at the end-or the beginning-of ila
boulevard depending upon which way you
were going it was twenty-five-hundred
feet of silver and native marble and
covered four city blocks and joe caradac
was top man-literally-since his office
and personal staff took up the whole two-
hundred and fifty-first floor

  his morning mail-about twelve let-
ters weeded out of the daily thousands
-was gotten out of the way with skill
and dispatch grinning he propped his
feet on the low curving window sill and
said miss kal-take an audiogram

  miss kal used two of her arms to ad-
just pad and stylus looking up expec-
tantly her other arms were busy trans-
cribing a previously dictated letter into
venusian-her native tongue although
she spoke sixty-eight-and tugging at a
humidified legging that had somehow
worked down almost- to the floor

  my dearest darling monkey- joe
began miss kal looked up again in amaze-
ment joe grinned at her and said its
to my wife

  miss kal nodded wisely and began to
write

  -i am sending this from my dark
and dismal office joe went on it was
a habit they had when anything went
wrong at breakfast joe load first pro-
posed by audiogram

  he casually watched a skimmer that was
in danger of creating a honey of a traffic
jam down below didnt that schlemiel
know his left from his right

  -where was i  oh yes-my dark and
dismal office joe scratched a cigarette
alight blew a happy smoke ring i hope
that you are feeling much much better
and that you will take luncheon with me
in the pluto room of the you-know-what
hotel- his mind went back to those
honeymoon days and he lost track of

callisto	

his dictation again another smoke ring
a somewhat more thoughtful one

  you-know-what hotel- said miss
kal phlegmatically

  yes-ah-just end it at one fifteen
sharp your everloving joe 

  there was a knock on the door and
miss kal set down her pad and stylus
and started to get up joe was on his
feet and around the desk in a second

  stay right where you are he smiled
i need the exercise

  miss kal smiled also and settled back
into her specially built chair with its tem-
perature and humidity controls a present
from mr caradac he was such a nice
being to work for

  joe opened the door and said oh
hullo kent since when are you knock-
ing

  big kent nodded formally to miss kal
and winked at joe he said yoe theres
something id like to talk over with you
in private

  with a sigh miss kal rose again and
made her way through the other door
into her little office the door closed be-
hind her

  kent let out a long breath he smiled
at joe and the smile turned into a laugh
that had an odd sound of triumph

  hohn uaml he said and laughed
again ut sinna dyonlwar

  joe sat down behind his desk and looked
at the big man hone you-amel wasnt
that what sarah had said-or something
very much like it he shook his head

  you wanted to talk to me about some-
thing kent what are you and sarah
cooking up with this gibberish

  the brilliant martian sunlight - not
as dim as had been anticipated in the
days before space travel-came through
the ceiling-high windows struck little
lights here and there from the bouquet
of venusian glass-moss that miss kal
tended so carefully it slanted across
kents big face as he looked at joe for
a long moment giving his left eye a pale
shallow lustre and throwing the shadow
of his jutting nose down over his mouth
he opened and closed his hands and said
nothing itll wait i guess his gaze
wandered over the room and settled on


planet stories

a corner that was empty save for a throw
rug-a relic of caradacs iowa past
kents mouth tightened into a thin line
he stared at the corner

  itll wait-for a while he said stiffly
and opened the door and went into the
outer office bone-faced he walked toward
the transveyor belt

  mr kent-mr kent the big mans
mercurian secretary rose out of a chair
near the door his voice quacking from the
speaker set into his fishbowl helmet

  yes

  they tolt me that you hat gone to
mr caratacs office sir ive been trying
to finte you all morning sir a laty sir
on the visiphone she has callt many times
-many times-

  thank you kent said tonelessly i
know who it is

joe caradac stared in astonishment
at the door first sarah-now kent
this seemed to be the day for everybody
to blast in orbits    well hell  he
shrugged his shoulders and called miss
kal back out of her office she dropped
into her chair with a sigh and they picked
up the days business from where it had
fallen

  san-vika of saturn enterprises was
threatening all kinds of things if he didnt
receive his shipment of ato-rotors on the
very next flight joe didnt waste much
time with that one of the many things
that made him a top executive was that
he knew how to deal with phonies he
told san-vika-via spacephone-that he
could go stick his heads in a waste elimi-
nator and push the button and that if he
wanted to get nasty m i and e- had an
army of lawyers hanging around just
itching to get their teeth into last years
insurance double-deal

  we let everybody get away with it-
once joe told him and cut the suddenly
fawning image off the screen m i and
es investigators he thought absently
could certainly give the sol secret ser-
vice a run for their credits now that
he had tactfully gotten san-vika straight-
ened out he might as well release those
ato-rotors to be shipped

  at twelve fifteen an audiogram came
from sarah i dont feel well enough to
come love s well at least it was an
improvement in tone

  at one oclock miss kal went into
her office to open the mysterious little
package of lunch that she brought with
her every day joe stretched out his
legs on the window sill and looked at
the traffic jam below that driver had
really done a fine job there were three
patrol skimmers circling the mess dart-
ing to and fro like angry wasps

  he didnt feel much like eating break-
fast and supper were his big meals-
the habit was a long-standing one how-
ever he thought this mornings break-
fast hadnt been much to rave about
orange juice some burned pohl some
undercooked sand-hoppers

  he switched on the inter-office visiphone

  i would save you the trouble he
said when miss kals face appeared but
they built this place so that all of my
inside calls have to be routed through
your selective tentacles

  the usual mr caradac

  the usual

  joe was rather proud of the fact that
everything in his division of m i and e
worked smoothly and efficiently-even the
kitchens in a little less than forty sec-
onds a portion of his desk folded back
and the usual appeared on an elevator
tray a pot of light coffee and some
doughnuts with powdered brown sugar

  joe dunked the solid portion of his
lunch and considered the mornings pe-
culiar happenings apparently unrelated
incidents that were related in part always
intrigued him there was usually a logical
reason for parallels the trick he thought
was to concentrate not on the coinci-
dences themselves but to examine the
circumstances under which they occurred

  sarahs illness-kents queer behavior
not obviously connected separately neu-
rotic yet what was it kent had said that
had reminded him of sarahs strange
greeting

  hone you-arnel

  the two had played practical jokes on
him before he grinned this was prob-
ably one of their special five-day jobs
cargo to

designed to make him into a shattered
wreck by friday so sarah could duck
him on saturday and get by with it

  joe repeated the syllables aloud try-
ing to make some sense out of them

  hone you-arnel

instantly he was on his feet fight-
ing his lips raving silently his big
chair tipped back and fell over to the
floor

  a furious icily cold intrusion was be-
ing made upon his mind he stood with
feet planted on either side of the over-
turned chair and threw the force off but
it came back again and again the office
was suddenly oppressive and stifling and
the objects about him were small and
crystal clear as if seen through the wrong
end of a hand galaxiscope the churning
utterly loathsome invasion surged up like
a wave roaring against a reef-and fell
back end away in horrible desperation

  from a million miles away he heard

-or felt-a voice it said uarnl-yes
uarnl and it said other things raging
things that joe could not understand

  then it was gone as suddenly as it
had come the office regained its normal
perspective the bright sunlight reflected
now from the tall buildings across the
great canal erased the ragged black hole
out of his consciousness

  painfully he righted the chair and sank
into it his lungs felt pressed in and
stale like the inside of a folded blanket
he took a deep breath shoved his wet
palms hard at the top of the desk

  uarnl the nightmare

  it came back to him as dreams rarely
do down to its last beastly detail a
dream of fear and peril-a running dream
-and not a dream after all uarnl he
looked at the corner of the room at the
colorful throw rug it lay there under
the sun brighter than it had been as if
a pane of glass had been lifted from it

  after a while he got up and went to
the door of miss kals office she looked
up vaguely concealing a small resigned
lizard under her jacket

  miss kal joe said blindly do you
have my morning papers

  he took the facsimiles back to his desk

callisto	

walking slowly afraid to get there and
sit down and open them the nightmare
the first aborted attempt sarah and kent
-approaching him separately-yet simi-
larly allies each had been confident that
during the night uarnl-had -

  there was nothing else on the front
sheets but the names ih lof dir and
uarnl and the story of their possessors
escape from mars detain a power break-
down had weakened the energy barrier
that kept their elusive minds and hence
their bodies in confinement by the time
armed rqlacements could be sent to the
aarnians isolated cell the beings had van-
ished the guards had been strangled
energy barriers had been set up at all
space and canal ports other barriers had
been formed into a hundred mile noose
that was being carefully drawn in toward
detain

  joe folded the last paper over the cruel
three-eyed faces that seemed to mock
him he fumbled at the visiphone miss
kal was wiping her lips cheerfully

  miss kal joe said get me mr
reader in shipping he leaned his el-
bows wearily on the desk and waited until
readers puritanical face appeared on the
screen

  yeah boss

  reader has anyone consigned four
large crates to go off-world tomorrow
night 

  yeah reader replied promptly mr
kent b-type mobile spacesuits had me
alter the manifest this mom-

do you have the crates down there
uh-uh mr kent said hed skim them
in sometime tomorrow he was coming up
to get the switch okd by you why
anything wrong

  joe opened the center drawer of his
desk

  no nothings wrong listen care-
fully reader im going to take care of
those crates myself if im-not in my
office tomorrow you are not to load them
on-ship no matter what mr ke-anyone
says or does if the crates come in re-
frigerate them and call the patrol and
send the name of the addressee to detain
immediately

  reader came as near as he ever had
	planet

to looking surprised nothing wrong
his right eyebrow shot up several milli-
meters joe added keep this in your
cheek and therell be double credits for
you pay-day

  reader nodded yeah boss dont i
always 

  joe took his atom pistol out of the
drawer handling it with unfamiliar fin-
gers it had been a long time since those
target shooting days in iowa he checked
the gun quickly reloaded it with fresh
pellets

  he had left the visiphone on and
when reader had broken his connection
the interior of miss kals office and the
surprised face of that eavesdropper had
automatically returned she stared at the
atom pistol

  miss kal joe said softly get me
a canal-cab

	 

  the bodies were lying in a row beneath
an overhanging ledge of sandstone they
had burrowed deep into a miniature jun-
gle of thick leaved canal weeds and it
had taken him a long time to find them
the gleam of four shiny new b-type
spacesuits less carefully concealed had
finally ended the search kent and ray
had been busy this morning

  standing where he was joe could look
down the green and red dotted slope and
see the ashes of the picnic fire the scat-
terings of food that the night-crawling
noils had found unpalatable and blown
by mars occasional winds-or taken by
alien hands-to a spot only a few feet
from where it had been thrown away
was the scrap of paper with his letterhead
on it the paper that he and kent had
marked up during their discussion of to-
morrow nights flight to aarn callisto

  if they didnt actually hear us talking
joe thought it was that paper that started
the whole thing

  he said loudly are you here uarnl
you thought it was perfect didnt you
you thought you could repossess your
bodies as the liner went off-world well
look at this

  with executival thoroughness he blasted
the four bodies into cinders

stories

sarah came out of the kitchen as joe
opened the canal door and let himself
in he turned and paid the cabby and the
skimmer moved off

  hello darling she said and tugged
at his arm ive got a swell supper fixed 

  joe smiled at her as he shrugged out of
his tunic he flung it casually over her
favorite potted zinhaeat she didnt grab
it off i should have been a detective he
thought he followed her into the kitchen

  anything interesting happen today
sarah began to arrange the table moving
things here and there fussily she looked
at joe from the corner of her eye thats
about how you like it isnt it she asked

  joe said thats fine he ground out
his cigarette on a clean plate sarah would
have taken his head off if he had ever
done that

  no he went on nothing happened
same old stuff

  they sat down to eat joe tasted his
soup it was rotten he wondered if they
cooked like that all over callisto or only
in aarn

  is it all right darling sarah was
looking at him brightly her fingers twined
under her chin with the left pinkie ex-
tended her head cocked to one side it
was all so cute that it made joe sick he
decided that if the showdown were put
off much longer hed never be able to
stand the sight of her again

  you havent called me darling since
our days of stardust and chivalry he
said call me joe

 what

  i said-call-me-joe

  sarah pushed her plate away her brown
eyes were muddy

  i wasnt hungry anyway she said
coldly

  big kent and ray came through the
door that led into the living room kent
leaned against the wall and folded his
massive arms he grinned mockingly at
joe we never give up he said ray
stared nervously and wet his lips

  joe shoved back his chair inch by inch

  uarnls dead he said he blundered
things in my office and got scared and
tried to get off-world in a passenger the
patrol blasted him
cargo to callisto



   sarah rose calmly and looked at ray
 and kent their faces were stony she
 said lof-dvr-i think the four of us
 together can break down his resistance
 to occupancy her eyes traveled to an
 empty corner of the kitchen are you
 ready uarnl

   she faced joe again a sly smile on her
 lips

   uarnl wasnt killed yoe-atomics
 dont kill us the passenyer was

   joe wasnt surprised when she floated
 away from the chair and toward him her
 slippers hardly seeming to touch the floor
 hed been expecting to be attacked

   but what almost broke him into little
 pieces was her third eye-the one that
 blinked open in the middle of her fore-
 head brushing aside a brittle shell of
 skin and glaring at him with its wide
 unhuman hunger then for one terrible
 second his brain felt packed in ice the
 ropm was grotesque filled with alien con-
 trivances the only sensible thing in it
 was ihs warm familiar third eye

   with all his melting strength joe
 thought i destroyed the bodies and the
  whole scene dangled unmoving before
 him the weird distant setting for the
 climax of a play as he heard his own
 voice in a wrenching groan

   our bodies-destroyed

   appalling misery and hatred for him-
 self rocked joes brain then uarnl re-
 coiled as the aamians rapport was
 broken

   joe cried chokingly lieutenant-lieu-
 tenant smith

   the canal door burst open and lieu-

 tenant smith of mars detain who had
 been hugging the narrow metal landing
 ledge came in like the proverbial tornado
 what hed heard had more than convinced
 him the deadly little sphere in his hands
 started to make sharp spitting sounds

  sarah and kent and ray and the in-
visible uarnl screamed all together in
a dissonance of agony and fear and death

then three of them stood

loosely in puzzled silence

  big kent brushed a hand across his
eyes ray he muttered what in hell
were you yelling about

  ray looked at him and sank into the
nearest chair

  yelling he said bewilderedly his
fingers began to unconsciously perform
on the chair arm i dont know was i
yelling

  sarah was in joes arms her blue-black
hair sending its aching fragrance into his
nostrils joe she whispered joe what
happened 

  he tipped back her head ran a finger
over her smooth brown forehead hyp-
nosis-to paralyze and freeze him to
weaken him he drew her face against
his shoulder again

  what had happened  what would those
psychologists back in iowa say if this
story ever reached their ears the bar-
rier-the some sort of block in my
mind my freakish mind that keeps out
projectors-and aarnians

   kent he said fix us all some drinks

klamugra

captain barnaby and lieutenant teajun stood
at the brink of that vast stone amphitheater
staring wonderingly down at half-an-acre of
gadget this glittering mass of million-year clock-
work was the machine    and soon it was
to judge them for their crime against mars

klaggchallak his furnose-
flaps pulled tight against his nos-
trils stumbled up to the gleaming
pinnacle of steel that seemed to offer shel-
ter against the night he felt a dust-storm
gathering in the west and knew that not
even the tough skin of a martian priest
could withstand the angry whippings of
sand lashed up by the wind-warlocks of
the desert

  the old priest drew a tiny folded malb
skin tent from his back-pack without
haste for he knew that the elder gods
of mars were watching his safety klagg-
challak pitched the tent against the west
stabilizer of the rocket drawing the tough
hide down to form a floor-flap and fas-
tening it to the steel of the  stabilizer
with tough mal-hooi glue which would
hold fast in the fiercest winds of mars
he looked for the sun and found it low
in the evening sky then crawled leisurely
into the yurt pulling the door-flap down
after him and gluing it to the floor he
had for himself a secure cocoon into
which the sand-devils could not force
their probing fingers before he slept the
old priest fingered his beads reciting his
evening invocation to various benevolent
and protective gods

  the falling sun threw a dancing star
against the hull of the ship standing tall
in its tail-chocks a bewildering wail the
banshee-call of danger ship jetting off
sounded but klaggchallak slept on hear-
ing through his dreams only the howling
of the wind

  sixty seconds later as prescribed in
the general regulations of the extra-
terrestrial service a second sound began
that most fearful of noises the sirening
of the rocket exhaust the martian in
his skin tent wakened and felt fear gnaw
at his bones fear induced by subsonic
tremors from the rocket blast klagg-
challak reached for his beads as the heat
soaked into his thick wrinkled skin

  in a moment the floor sagged beneath
him with the wa-skin pouch dangling
ridiculously from its tail assembly the
exts rocket vulcan rose with great
gentleness from its tail-chocks pushed up
on its spraying jets

  four seconds later the ship was a ruby
flame above the low hills eight seconds
later a charred bipod a bifurcated cinder
tumbled down from space to strike near
the jetoff field where the vulcans tail-
chocks glowed dull red and the blackened
ground smoldered a moment later a

bracelet of blast-welded beads tumbled
down from the sky falling near the car-
bon hulk that a few seconds before had
been klaggchallak a martian priest
great in wisdom and in honor among his
people

captain jan barnaby and
lieutenant kim teajun of the ex-
traterrestrial service stood before the
board of inquiry at denver d f the
president of the board a chief com-
manders star-on-silver gleaming at his
right collar point opened the proceedings
the military rocket vulcan exts
light cruiser is accused by the martian
authorities of causing the death of one
klaggchallak a priest they further claim
that the death of klaggchallak was caused
by criminal negligence on the part of
the pilot and co-pilot of the rocket cap-
tain jan barnaby and lieutenant kim
teajun respectively such neglect being
within the definition of murder in the
martian legal code the judging author-
ity of mars demands that we deliver
these two men to them for trial and
eventual punishment

  the commander stroked his grey hair
thoughtfully as he looked up from his
report to the two unhappy officers before
him at ease gentlemen barnaby and
teajun slumped while im inclined to
agree with you two that klaggchallaks
frying was his own fool fault i must
say that you picked a damned poor time
to become the instruments of his im-
molation we had hoped to establish an
extra-territoriality agreement with mars
but the death of old klaggchallak puts
that out of the question to further mar-
tian tranquility you men will have to re-
turn to mars and face the judging au-
thority there if my feelings were all
that is at stake gentlemen id tell the
marties to go trippingly to hell and keep
you here on earth but to do this would
mean wed be forced to abandon our bases
and mines and surveys on all mars wed
be giving our european competitors a
clear field the commander folded the
report neatly once and again captain
barnaby and lieutenant kim youll be on
the next mars-ward ship we cant help

you if youre convicted by our fuzzy
friends youll have to stay there and
take whatever punishment they demand

  kim was remembering a scene he and
barnaby had witnessed at klamugra the
seat of the martian judging authority
a martian convicted of murder was
being executed atop a high metal plat-
form a large portion of the citys popu-
lation was gathered before the platform
watching the edifying spectacle of a fel-
low-martian dying with horrifying slow-
ness as the chocks of a vise pressed into
his skull they were bearcats for gladia-
torial amusement

  do you gentlemen have any ques-
tions 

  lieutenant kim glanced at captain
barnaby then spoke yes sir id like
to know how long were going to let the
marties push us around this way thir-
teen martian priests are on our payroll
just because they demand it weve got to
stay five kilometers away from their
cities or pay a five-hundred credit fine
we cant spit without special permission
from the grand council of mars we
dont think like they do why should we
submit to being judged by their million-
year-old laws in all respect sir why
does our service act so weak

  the commander made a pyramid of
thumbs and forefingers and considered
it lieutenant kim ive been asking
myself that question for the last ten
years weve had to pay tribute to gain
the marties permission to stay on their
god-forsaken planet that tribute repre-
sents half the operating expense of the
martian department of the service
credits that should be spent on new ships
and more men weve behaved like a
bunch of patsies ever since von munger
and ley landed on mars

  still were all soldiers and we must
follow regulations we mustnt disturb
the indigenous population on mars thats
regulation a-l if our policies grow
distasteful to the marties they may call
in the europeans to take our place we
wouldnt like that its bad form to admit
it gentlemen but im ashamed to give
you this order youre to jet off for
mars tomorrow morning and on arrival
machine of klamugra



at klamugra to deliver yourselves over
to the martian judging authority the
commander rapped his gavel and stood
the two officers before the board snapped
to attention board of inquiry dis-
missed

fully aware that tomorrows jet-
off would multiply by eight the
hangovers they were breeding captain
barnaby and lieutenant kim sat that
evening in the denver dive alternating
drinks of european vodka with rounds
of california moon-dew as kim said
drink as much as you like barnaby 
were not driving in the morning

  tell me barnaby demanded of his
co-pilot what youre thinking of you
martie-roasting fiend of a korean

  i was considering the memory of the
shlunk that martian murderers skull
made when it finally gave in that day
at klamugra do you remember hard-
headed yankee kims eyes followed
the blonde ecdysiast across the stage more
from habit than present interest

  why did you have to remember that
shlunk-ugh

  were going to have to squirm out
of this barnahy-siinsanff kim said
well have to beat that rap at klamugra
its not that i wish to avoid putting my
head in a vise its only that it hurts me
to see the extraterrestrial sendee made
a monkey of this way in a way it will
even be a shame if we get off think of
all the marties who will miss the oppor-
tunity to see your punkin head smashed
you orientals have noble souls kim
the blonde stripper having uncovered
as much of herself as she could without
resorting to dissection jumped down
from the stage and walked over to the
two exts officers would you gentle-
men like to buy me a drink she asked

  kims eyes roved abroad in a brief
anatomy lesson but barnaby said ill
buy you one a couple of weeks from
now if im not laid up somewhere with
a splitting headache he stood unsteadily
and tossed a ten-credit certificate on the
table if youre really thirsty get a
drink out of that

-planet stories-november

  kim reluctantly followed his superior
officer from the bar at the door he turned
and called back to the blonde dont
catch cold child ill be back

	 

  the dawn jetoff was miserable as jet-
offs always are four days brought the
ship within falling-distance of mars soon
the jets thundered as it backed into a
pocket of hills outside klamugra the
air-pumps hammered to bring the air
pressure inside the hull gradually down
to that of the outside so that instru-
ments and equipment wouldnt be sub-
jected to a sudden lowering of pres-
sure the men inside the ship slipped
plastic helmets over their heads checked
the tiny air-pumps on their shoulders
and drew on heavy gloves and boots

  when the port swung open kim and
barnaby climbed down the ladder to the
blast-blackened sand the sergeant of
exts provost marshall who had ac-
companied them walked with the officers
to a hill overlooking the ancient martian
city of klamugra which  stood on a ter-
race about five kilometers to the north
the red adobe walls of the city testimony
of the ancient days when mars had
enough water to allow its use for brick-
making blended with the distance to seem
a part of the red desert sand

  a cloud of steam and dust appeared
between the hill where they stood and
the city captain barnaby un-leathered
his binoculars and pressed them to the
eyepieces of his helmet and made out a
hopping jeep its top enclosed in plastic
and a trio of supercharger coils poking
through the sides of the hood clouds of
steam followed the jeep as its exhaust
streamed out into the chilly air

in a moment the jeep spun up the
hill and ground to a halt there was a
pause as the men inside the jeep fitted
their helmets on their shoulders checked
their airpumps and drew on their gaunt-
lets then the plastic bubble lifted back
a sergeant jumped out from under the
steering wheel and saluted and a colonel
exts intelligence walked up to captain
barnaby and lieutenant kim gentle-
men he said im colonel lee mont-


planet stories

gomery commanding officer third sec-
tor it is my unpleasant duty to turn you
over to the chief technician of the mar-
tian judging authority who is rhink-
lavn here

  at these words a tall martian unfolded
himself from the back seat of the jeep
he climbed out and bowed before cap-
tain bamaby i am rhinklavn captain
the thick fur nose-flaps looking like ear-
muffs pulled across his muzzle muffled
rhinklavns high-pitched voice so that it
gave the effect of coming from the bottom
of a rain barrel you are to accompany
me to klamugra to be judged by the
machine of which i am the honored
first technician

  bamaby and kim bowed slightly to ac-
knowledge rhinklavn then crawled into
the back seat of the jeep next to colonel
montgomery

  rhinklavn and the sergeant sat up
front the sergeant pushed a button on
the instrument panel and the plastic top
of the jeep dropped down to cover them
as the engine started the jeeps air pump
drew in air until the atmosphere was
thick enough for human lungs the mar-
tian squirmed uncomfortably in the heavy
air while his human companions threw off
their helmets lieutenant kim gratefully
drew a deep breath of air and regretted it
immediately what with the million-year
water shortage the martians had lost even
the word for bath besides the most
popular article of martian cuisine is a
bulb strikingly similar to the terrestrial
garlic plant captain bamaby turned to
kim mars has a distinguished atmos-
phere hasnt it he spoke in english
rather than in the esperanto lingua-franca
of space

  indeed it has kim agreed what
was old fuzz-face up there talking about
when he spoke of the machine col-
onel 

  the law of mars is the most rigidly
systematized in the solar system col-
onel montgomery replied several mil-
lions of years ago a bright martie got
the idea that it was unwise to trust mor-
tal judges with a problem so important
as the sentencing of criminals so he
called in a lot of mechanics-ancient mars

had some pretty fair engineers though
they never discovered electricity-and had
them build a judging-machine since the
climate is right and the machine was built
of a stainless steel its still here and still
being used its an enormous thing
spreads over half an acre in a big amphi-
theatre in the center of town its an ana-
logue computer rather clumsy by terres-
trial standards but nevertheless well-
built you know the principles of ana-
logue calculators instead of working
with coded position-valued impulses like
the electronic astrogator on our rockets
the mechanical machines solve problems
by making use of the physical analogies
between cogs and gears and differentials
do you mean that were going to be
punished or set free by a bunch of clock-
work colonel kim asked

  in a way yes the machine is a most
impersonal judge that fact wont help
you though martian legal code is strict
about killing there being some thirty-odd
degrees of murder ranging in seriousness
from a simple homicide to secure a
mate the punishment for which is death
by dehydration most often to killing to
secure for oneself material benefits for
which there exist more subtle forms of
death by torture

  like getting a small-head-size in a
vise captain bamaby grunted

  thats the usual punishment for mur-
der in the seventeenth degree where the
crime is usually killing for spiritual ad-
vancement you see each crime is given
special study by the machine a great
many factors are fed in collated with
certain constants within the machine pro-
cessed through several dozen stages and
finally combined into a single number
which represents the punishment called
for by the way the colonel studied the
back of rhinklavns head no considera-
tion of the truthfulness of the defen-
dant is entered into the machine it is
presumed that should a man say that he
did not commit a crime he didnt if he
did hed admit it martians have a pe-
culiar character defect that prevents them
from lying

  a defect from which we humans are
fortunately free kim grinned
machine of

  thats no out colonel montgomery
countered they have witnesses who
saw klaggchallak fry besides we pre-
fer to have the mass of marties ignorant
of the average earthlings penchant for
prevarication it saves the service a lot
of money not to have to prove anything

it tells our hairy hosts out here



the jeep hit the first of the series
of low terraces which set the city of
klamugra up from the surrounding desert
plains and the little car bounced high off
the sand colonel montgomery looked
startled as though hed just remembered
something you know in my ethnological
fervor i didnt realize what you two men
are in for cosmos im practically de-
livering you up as human sacrifices

  we came to that conclusion five days
ago colonel lieutenant kim dryly ob-
served

i can see what the fleet commander
meant whenhe said that he was giving
me a most unpleasant assignment hell

i dont think the machine is able to give
a judgment of not guilty colonel mont-
gomery gazed toward the city they were
approaching weve got to turn you in
we cant risk a blowup with the martian
grand council there are rumors that
   the colonel glanced again with sus-
picion at the back of rhinklavns hairy
neck as though suspecting that the mar-
tian might be able to puzzle out the mean-
ing of their conversation though it was
in english there are rumors that the
-artiansmay have an agent among the
-ussiansray we cant risk having the
borsch-eaters more popular out here than
the western powers the jeep bounded
up the last of the terraces and through
an opening in the city wall the adobe
buildings raced past and with a final
bound the jeep came to the edge of the
huge circular bowl which held the ma-
chine

  theres your judge colonel mont-
gomery said speaking in esperanto again
i havent much hope to offer you for
one thing youre the first humans ever
to be judged by the machine

  the men picked up their helmets and
airpumps and adjusted them on their

klamugra	

shoulders rhinklavn drew his furry nos-
tril-flaps down into place against the sud-
den change in pressure the plastic top
of the jeep flew back on its springs
and the men climbed out stretching their
cramped muscles the radiophones in the
helmets buzzed and the colonel gave cap-
tain barnaby a last word i want to
impress you with the fact that the ser-
vice cannot protect you from this mo-
ment onward if you escape being killed
it must be on your own merits and
dont start shooting marties--wont do
you a bit of good theres a lot at stake
for earth here good luck men col-
onel montgomery saluted and he and his
sergeant jumped back in the jeep slammed
the top down and whirled away

  rhinklavn turned to the two exts
 officers gentlemen ive assigned you
 quarters here near the machine will
 you follow me kim and barnaby fol-
 lowed the martian a short distance from
 the edge of the amphitheater to a lone
 adobe building one story high and about
 ten meters square here are your quar-
 ters where youll stay tonight your judg-
 ing is set for tomorrow morning

   captain barnaby glanced into the build-
 ing and was surprised to see that it
 closed with an airlock had terrestrial
 canned foods on neat shelves and had
 regular service cots in place of the
 rough momeather mats that the martians
 slept on it was good of you to go to
 all this trouble just for myself and lieu-
 tenant kim rhinklavn the captain
 said

   the martian paused at the door its
 not just for you captain five other ter-
 restrials have committed crimes of various
 proportions within the last few weeks

 	they will also be tried here after your
 case is disposed of rhinklavn left con-
 siderately closing the airlock door and
 starting the pump on his way out

   lieutenant kim took a can of b ra-
 tion beans down from the shelf and
 thoughtfully began to open it with his
 service knife captain he said this
 sort of thing could drive our service from
 mars if the marties consider it their
 right to judge every earthling who runs
 a jeep into a farmers nial or lands half
	planet

 a meter too near one of their cities we
 wont have a man on the planet in a
 couple of years

  kim were precedents

  what do you mean yankee

  if the marties succeed in convicting
us of murder in some unheard-of degree
by using that overgrown erector set of
theirs well be only the first two of a
long string of extservicemen to be exe-
cuted under mars law we cant let them
do it captain barnaby paused a moment
to pour himself out a plateful of beans
kim what was that process you used
to rely on back in exts academy in
denver the one that gave you the right
answers after you found that your first
solutions to our astrogation problems
were a few hundred thousand kilometers
off

  kim stopped chewing for a moment in
surprise you mean that you got through
the acahemy without using the finagle
factor no wonder you made captain so
soon its simple id look up the right
answer in the service charts find by
what factor my solution was off and
introduce that factor into my next calcu-
lation making it inconspicuous under a lot
of mathematical camouflage dont bawl
me out about it barny i just couldnt see
letting my extracurricular activities suffer
for my schoolwork

   yes you did a lot of your studying at
the denver dive no matter little man
eat hearty and get some sleep barnaby
stirred his beans thoughtfully weve got
a big day ahead of us tomorrow

early the next morning a

subordinate technician of the machine
hammered on the airlock the two terres-
trials pulled on their heavy jackets fur boots
and gauntlets started the little air pumps
on their shoulders and opened the lock
the honored first technician of the ma-
chine invites your presence at your trial
which is to begin very soon the martian
said speaking halting esperanto kim and
barnaby followed him to the edge of the
machine bowl there had been several
changes made during the night an ele-
vated platform had been set up identical
to the one used in the bloody execution

stories

theyd witnessed about twenty martians
were clustered around the machine some
of them making last-minute adjustments
in the mechanism others evidently sight-
seers gazing curiously at the two prin-
cipals in the trial

  rhinklavn was waiting his nose flaps
drawn over his nostrils to keep the cold
morning air from cutting into his lungs
i am pleased that you come he said
the machine is fully assembled for your
problem he pointed down toward the
machine a vast cluster of separate stages
connected by rods on the far right in
that small building is the power source of
the machine a mercury-turbine engine
we cant spare the water to make steam
you know the first stage contains the
martian actuarial tables the second has
the actuarial system for determining the
probable life-spans of you two earthlings
thats without taking into consideration
the probability that you two will be exe-
cuted as a result of the judgement of the
machine

  lieutenant kim nodded most ingen-
ious but im afraid that theres a factor
that youve omitted

  weve made no factual error lieuten-
ant rhinklavn insisted the value of
the sage klaggchallak is represented there
- he pointed to the fourth stage and
your social value to the people of mars is
here represented rhinklavn waved one
mitten-like hand toward the fifth stage
if youll examine that stage youll ob-
serve that your value is negative the shaft
representing it revolves in a direction
opposite to that of the others yes youll
surely be executed

  captain barnaby nodded as though the
reiteration of the probability of his early
demise troubled him less than the philo-
sophical question hed stumbled across
still as my subordinate officer has said
theres a factor which you seem to have
omitted in the terminology of terrestrial
psychometering this quantity is called-
what did you say it was lieutenant kim

  the finagle factor sir

  really rhinklavn asked the light of
scientific inquiry in his eyes i thought
id taken all the variables of earthling
physiology and psychology into considera-
machine of klammjgra



tion when i set up the plans for the trial
what are the mathematics of this finagle
factor 

captain barnaby put one foot
up on a connecting shaft as though
he were in the denver dive discussing the
relative merits of two video dancers as
youve doubtless noticed in your extensive
study of the terrestrial mind sir hon-
ored first technician of the machine we
of earth place almost equal value on a
mans intelligence and on his financial
standing as criteria of his worth

  yes rhinklavn mused i noticed
your preoccupation with both intelligence
a minor mental quality by the way far
inferior to spiritual insight or time-sense
and with the individuals possession of
western credits

  as i said captain barnaby continued
there exists a precise formula developed
by the   

  by the noyoudont dentifrice labora-
tories kim supplied

  yes their laboratories developed the
mathematics of the finagle factor briefly
it is this the square root of the product
of intelligence quotient over one hun-
dred times the number of credits the indi-
vidual has outstanding or written alge-
braically barnaby knelt down and traced
in the sand with his gloved index finger

  x money in the bank

  quite a simple equation easily repre-
sented on the machine rhinklavn ob-
served he called a subordinate technician
to his side and spoke to him in the clicking
polysyllables of the martian language
turning again to captain barnaby he
asked and what are the values of iq
and money in the bank for you and
lieutenant kim

	our combined iqs total about 
how many credits do you own lieutenant
kim

  hell sir ive got more debts than
credits

  figure up your debts then lieuten-
ant

  kim raised his right gauntlet drew a
pad of paper and a pencil from a pocket at

the back of his hand and scribbled rapidly
if we get out of this captain ill owe
about  credits subtracting pay due
for the last semi-annual period i owe 
credits

  and i have debts totaling  credits
captain barnaby said thoughtfully he
turned to rhinklavn the debts of
myself and lieutenant kim sir honored
first technician of the machine total
 western credits being debt thats
a negative number of course

  of course captain rhinklavn
agreed the machine can handle any sort
of number even a negative number you
noticed that your social value to mars
was easily represented as a minus-num-
ber rhinklavn talked rapidly to his as-
sistant and handed him the values of the
finagle factor rewritten in martian ideo-
graphs he faced captain bamaby again
it will take us about an hour to enter
this new factor into the machine he said
youll not mind waiting

  no not at all barnaby murmured
he and kim leaned against the inside wall
of the amphitheater watching the martian
technicians hurry about they removed
gears and replaced them with gears of an-
other ratio they connected a stage con-
sisting of eccentric cams strung on shafts
and they installed a mass of machinery at
the sixth stage where the operation of
extracting square root was to take place
kim comparing the heavy gears and
levers of the machine with the compact
tubes of his electronic astrogator re-
marked its like using a trip hammer
to crack a walnut

after a few minutes of

watching kim and bamaby became
conscious of an intruder within their hel-
mets a most unpleasant odor they
glanced up to the edge of the bowl the
martian sightseers were sitting up there
dangling their legs above the machine and
utilizing the pause in the proceedings to
eat their picnic lunches they were busily
unwrapping bundles of food from the
mal-skin pouches hanging by their sides
and eating as they watched the techni-
chians work over the machine

  one of the tourists judging from his


planet

stories

height a young male threw a small par-
cel toward kim the lieutenant picked it
up and unwrapped it the stench of mar-
tian garlic became unbearable as kim
stared at the unidentifiable tidbit of meat
the martian had thrown him the air-
pump on his shoulder drew the redolence
into his helmet in such quantities that
kims eyes burned he gestured to show
that while his every instinct demanded
that he eat the delicious morsel he
couldnt take his helmet off to do so with
an elaborate pantomiming of sorrow kim
pitched the gift back up to the martian
boy

  a few adjustments later the technicians
filed up from the machine pit rhinklavn
walked over to the two exts officers if
you gentlemen will accompany me well
begin the trial at once

  kim and barnaby walked together up
the steps that led from the machine then
turned and looked down at the dozens of
stages of complex machinery into which
memory and intelligence of a sort had been
built rhinklavn pointed toward the fifth
and sixth stages it is there that the com-
bined finagle factors of you men will be
calculated the fifth stage is quite simple
it will perform the necessary division and
multiplication the sixth stage will extract
the square root of the product derived by
the fifth the next six stages of machinery
contain the variables of terrestrial behav-
ior which i and my colleagues calculated
from earth texts the other stages on the
field fifty-three of them will collate the
results of the calculations of the first
twelve stages with our legal code and de-
termine punishment the final product will
appear at the sixty-seventh stage repre-
sented as the speed of rotation of a single
shaft the revolutions-per-time-interval
are decoded by a simple formula to deter-
mine the punishment to be levied upon you
doubtless it will be some unpleasant form
of death

  kim muttered that he wished that mar-
tians had a bit more tact

  rhinklavn waved a hairy ann toward
his assistant who had remained below in
the machine pit and that martian ran to
the power house to start the mercury-tur-
bine engine that ran the machine with a

whistling that set the thin atmosphere
trembling for miles around the turbine
began to turn

  the sightseers on the edge of the am-
phitheater wrapped up the scraps of their
lunches replaced them in their m-skin
picnic hampers and stood up to watch the
machine kim and barnaby paced up and
down along the edge of the bowl looking
down upon the mechanical cerebration
being performed by the huge machine
with a smooth transfer of power from one
stage to the next the first problem-the
probable duration of klaggchallaks life
when it had been interrupted by the jets
of the vulcan-was solved and the mech-
anism of the second stage began to re-
volve

  theyre seeing how long we can be
expected to live now captain barnaby
commented

  that problem fled through a mass of
gears and cams and the partial solution
the sum of the two earthlings life expect-
ancies divided by that of the priest klagg-
challak ran across a shaft to the third
stage which would determine the old
priests value to the society of mars on
into the fourth stage the problem flowed
to combine all previous factors with the
earthlings social value to mars a negative
number

  in a few moments the problem had pro-
gressed to the fifth stage of the machine
where the first steps of the finagle factor
were solved the product a negative
number as could be seen by the reversed
rotation of the main shaft bowed into the
sixth stage which was to extract square
root

he turbine howled protest
as it was forced to overcome the in-
ertia of the sixth stage but a governor
at the input stage held the shaft-speed
constant the seventh stage all ready for
the problem when it should appear from
the sixth held all the computations of the
first four stages in its smoothly-turning
entrails the initial portion of the sixth
stage began to move slowly

  there was a sudden grating noise as
the feed-in gear of the fifth stage came
in contact with a solution gear of the
machine of klamugra



sixth which refused to move the whine
of the mercury-turbine engine was shak-
ing the ground beneath the two officers
feet now

  as the martian technicians and pic-
nickers looked on in amazement the shaft
between the fifth stage and the sixth began
to twist like a stick of moist putty the
sixth stage strained and shuddered then
followed the twisting shaft over tearing its
moorings- from the ground and smashing
upside-down the seventh stage entered
into the chaos ripping out anchors of
steel-in-concrete and slamming onto its
side in a moment all the machines in
the bowl were muttering and straining
against the earth rhinklavn ran to the
stairway that led down into the pit in the
adobe powerhouse the mercury engine was
whirling at twenty times its optimum rate
tearing the atmosphere with the sound of
its screaming power there was the rattle
of shrapnel exploding within the walls of
the powerhouse as the turbine threw off the
restrainment of its governor the whole
field within the bowl was a mass of twitch-
ing clockwork shaken by the final storm-
ings of the suicidal turbine bars of
shining steel twisted and snapped gear
teeth flew singing through the thin air
the final chain of stages tore itself loose
from anchoring and crashed to its side
there was a final roar of defiance from the
turbine and the powerhouse walls dis-
solved before an out-rushing blast of su-
perheated mercury kim and barnaby
threw themselves to the ground as the din
increased for a moment and the martian
sightseers sought refuge behind nearby
buildings suddenly the machine was si-
lent except for the tinkle of scraps of
metal falling to the cement

  looks as though we were too much
for judge jury and d a kim
murmured into his radiophone barnaby
nodded then cautiously climbed to his feet

  rhinklavn climbed back up the stair-
way to the brink of the amphitheater-be-
come-junkyard he shoved his way
through the questioning crowd of martian
sightseers without a word looks like hes
going to cry lieutenant kim commented
into his radiophone true rhinklavns
nose-flaps were hanging limply down below

his chin a sure sign of great emotion in
a martian

  rhinklavn faced captain barnaby
wordlessly for a moment you may
leave now he said at last the martian
turned his back on the captain to look
down again on the wreck that had been
his beloved machine

he two exts officers wan-
dered about klamugra the cyno-
sure of all martian eyes though no one
tried to stop them or ask them questions
lieutenant kim finally spotted a radio
tower jutting up above the red adobe
buildings hurrying in the direction of the
tower kim and barnaby found the kla-
mugra headquarters of the extraterres-
trial service

  colonel montgomery jumped to his feet
as they came in a look of bald disbelief
on his face man im glad to see you
two i was about to storm out like a knight
in shiny armor and save you from the
marties he waved his hand toward the
helmet and rifle lying on his typewriter
table-if id gotten there too late id
have ruptured interplanetary friendship
for sure-and indicated a decanter on
his desk have some thats edinbourgh
scotch not los angeles moon-dew tell
me why i happen to be talking to you
now instead of making up a couple of
packages for your next-of-kin

  we wrecked their damn machine
kim said happily dropping his helmet
and gauntlets to the floor and measuring
out several fingers of the colonels scotch
into his ration can

  to be a bit more accurate captain
barnaby corrected we drove the machine
insane he poured himself a stiff shot
of scotch and downed it with appreciation

  our personalities are so complex that
the machine blew up all over the landscape
when it tried to understand them kim
said he dragged a chair out from behind
the typewriter table and sat down care-
fully balancing the ration can

  its rather as though we should set our
electronic astrogator to work on a problem
with three variables in five dimensions
rather than in four captain barnaby ex-
plained as you told us the machine


planet stories

was a mechanical-analogus calculator it
can multiply divide add square and cube
and extract roots it performs these oper-
ations by coding numbers into mechanical
relationships

  just a big adding machine kim com-
mented irreverently

  and our finagle factor was too much
for a mechanical system captain bar-
naby briefly explained to the colonel how
he and kim had induced rhinklavn to add
their invented factor to the machines set-
up you see the finagle factor resolved
itself into the square root of a negative
number an electronic calculator like our
astrogator could extract the root of a
minus-number imaginary numbers of
this sort are implicit in its circuit the
martian machine out there couldnt do this
though since there is no mechanical ana-
logue for an imaginary number the ma-
chine tried to extract the square root of
our-finagle factor in the same manner in
which it would attempt to extract the
root of a real number

  kim drained his ration can neatly and
remarked the machine couldnt do what
it had to all the power of the turbine was
thrown into the root extracting system
which wouldnt revolve so the machine
went nuts pardon me sir and blew its
top wrecked the power source and all

  sixty-seven stages with the square root
of minus one we busted up a machine
half a million years old

 what now  colonel montgomery
asked rhetorically

  captain barnaby studied the bottom of
his ration-can a moment well sir
rhinklavn was more puzzled than an-
gered he wanted to judge humans not
out of malice but from a genuine scien-
tific curiosity he wanted to see how the
machine would act with an alien problem
his machine is too badly broken-up ever
to repair hell have to find another meth-
od of judging criminals first of all mar-
tian society is founded on strict law
just a moment the colonel got up
from his desk and went down the hall to
a door marked judge advocate generals
department exts he returned with a
heavy book bound between khaki-board
covers well give this book to rhink-
lavn and you gentlemen may return to the
denver joint

  dive sir kim corrected

  yes lieutenant colonel montgom-
ery handed the big book to captain barn-
aby take this to rhinklavn before you
leave captain

  barnaby turned to the title page and
read in esperanto blackstone on the
study of lap

  editorial from the tampa times en-
titled ode to the maladjusted

  we look with dubious eye on the
psyching programs which are now applied
to us early enough to result in a balanced
adjustment to the world as we know it

  the other day we wondered what
we might be doing were it not for the
psyching which has made us such a com-
placent scribbler of these immortal words

  for a moment we thought with hor-
ror of a neurotic maladjusted little man

full of sighs and dreams and imagery and
then it struck us that many of the men
who have come forward in times of stress
have been drawn from just such groups
during the space wars which ended a
bare twenty years ago we would have lost
it is certain were it not for men so mal-
adjusted that violence was their creed
brutality their way of life danger a
necessary drug their very lustiness was
our margin of victory their names are a
heady drumbeat crewson hallison holt
tane cryler stake

  we know that the possibility of an-
other space war is so remote as to be
purest fantasy with ten thousand planets
open to us mankind will spend a thousand
generations before there is enough surplus
energy for war or industrial capacity to
divert to armament

  yet should it happen we psyched ones
are as unsuited for war as is a steer for
the bullring

  and who will there be to save the scalp
of this scribbler next time

  from the minutes of the annual meet-
ing of the tamarack club

  treasurer when the heroes of
space were given honorary memberships
in the tamarack club twenty years ago
i do not believe that the members of that
period realized that the recipients would
make this club their headquarters and
 ah  i do not believe that they
realized the troublemaking abilities of the
group our dues are sufficiently high so
that we are composed of top executives
from industry in this area all of course
except those spacemen the situation con-
stantly grows more serious during the
past month our losses in club equipment
destroyed and damaged were heavy mr i
l intermann after being thrown out
onto the sidewalk by two of the   ah
   spacemen tendered his resignation
there must be an end to this brawling
in the tamarack club and an end to those
interminable lies they tell in the bar every
afternoon this is a decent club for decent
law-abiding members it is within our
power to rescind their honorary mem-
berships i doubt whether any one of them
has saved the money from his pension

mitkey a small gray mouse is
captured by professor oberbur-
ger a refugee german scientist
living in connecticut and working on a
rocket to be sent to the moon mitkey is
placed in a compartment of the rocket for
experimental purposes

   the rocket is deflected by and lands on
 prxl-an asteroid with a highly eccentric
 orbit it is inhabited by a race of tiny but
 super-intelligent beings




planet

stories

  the prxlidns in order to question mit-
key raise his intelligence level to the point
where he can assimilate and understand
his own memories and tell them about con-
ditions on earth

  thus mitkey finds himself with a lan-
guage-the thick german dialect spoken
by the professor who had talked inces-
santly to himself and to mitkey while he
worked on the rocket

  the prxlians who became fond of mit-
key send him and the rocket back to
earth mitkey approaches professor ober-
burger and tries to sell him on the idea of
letting mitkey raise the intelligence level
of all other mice by means of a ray pro-
jector which the prxlians have taught him
how to construct

  mitkey believes intelligent mice could
live in peace with men and suggests that
mice be given a portion of the earth as
their own the professor is doubtful

  but an accidental electrical shock spoils
mitkeys plans

  the professor has been keeping minnie
mitkeys mate as a pet on an island
surrounded by an electrical barrier mitkey
seeing minnie there dashes recklessly
across and receives the shock which de-
stroys his new-found intelligence and
makes him again just an ordinary little
mouse

  and he and minnie resume their happy
life behind the wall of the professors lab-
oratory until   

in the darkness within
the wall there was movement and
mitkey who was once again merely
a little gray mouse scurried for the hole
in the baseboard mitkey was hungry and
just outside that hole lay the professors
icebox and under the icebox cheese

  a fat little mouse mitkey almost as fat
as minnie who had lost her figure com-
pletely because of the professors gener-
osity

  alvays mitkey professor oberbur-
ger had said vill be cheese under der
izebox alvays and there always was
not always ordinary cheese either roque-
fort and beerkase and hand cheese and
camembert and sometimes imported
swiss that looked as though mice had

already lived in it and which tasted like
mouse-heaven

  and minnie ate and mitkey ate and it
was well that the holes in the walls and
the baseboards were large holes else their
roly-poly little bodies would no longer
have found passage

  but something else was happening too
something that would have pleased and
yet worried the good professor had he
known

  in the darkness within a tiny mind
there were stirrings not unlike the scurry-
ing of mice within a wall stirrings of
strange memories memories of words and
meanings memories of deafening noise
within the black compartment of a rocket
memories of something more important
than cheese and minnie and darkness

  slowly mitkeys memories and intelli-
gence were coming back

  there under the shadow of the icebox
he paused and listened in the next room
professor oberburger was working and
as always talking to himself

  und now ve pudt on der landing
vanes much bedder iss mit landing
vanes for vhen der moon it reaches
softly it vill land iff air iss there

  almost almost it made sense to mit-
key the words were familiar and they
brought ideas and pictures into his little
gray head and his whiskers twitched with
the effort to understand

  the professors heavy footsteps shook
the floor as he walked to the doorway
of the kitchen and stood there looking
at the mouse-hole in the baseboard

  mitkey should i set again der trap

of a little gray mouse cowering beside
a plate of cheese under the icebox un-
seen in the shadow almost almost he
remembered

  the professors steps turned away and
mitkey turned to the cheese

  but still he listened and with uneasi-
ness that he could not understand

  a click

  and a click in the mind of a mouse
under an icebox mitkey stopped nibbling
cheese and looked at it instead he had
a word for it cheese

  very softly to himself he said it
cheese halfway between a squeak and
a word it was for the vocal chords prxl
had given him were rusty but the next
time it sounded better cheese he said

  and then the other two words coming
without his even thinking about it dot
iss cheese

  and it frightened him a little so he
scurried back into the hole in the wall
and the comforting darkness then that

became just a bit frightening too because
he had a word for that too vail be-
hind der vail

  no longer was it just a picture in his
mind there was a sound that meant it
it was very confusing and the more he
remembered the more confusing it be-
came

darkness of night outside the
professors house darkness within the
wall but there were bright lights in the
professors workroom and there was
brightening dimness in mitkeys mind as
he watched from a shadowed vantage
point

  that gleaming metal cylinder on the
workbench-mitkey had seen its like be-
fore and he had a word for that too
rocket

  and the big lumbering creature who
worked over it talking incessantly to him-
self as he worked   

  almost mitkey called out brofessor

  but the caution of mousehood kept him
silent listening

  it was like a downhill-rolling snowball

ouhaef earned peace und pestno peace uno cheese
	planet

now that growing memory of mitkeys
words came back in a rush as the pro-
fessor talked words and meanings

  and memories like the erratic shapes
of jig-saw falling one by one into a co-
herent picture

  und der combartment for der mouse-
hydraulic shock absorbers yet so der
mouse lands softly-safely und der short-
vafe radio dot vill tell me vhether he liffs
in der moons admosphere after   

  admosphere and there was contempt
in the professors voice these vools who
say the moon it hass no admosphere
chust because der spegtroscope-

  but the slight bitterness in the voice of
the professor was nothing to the growing
bitterness in mitkeys little mind

  for mitkey was mitkey again now
memory intact if a bit confused and
spotty his dreams of moustralia and
all

  his first sight of minnie after his re-
turn and the blackout-step onto tinfoil
charged with electricity that had ended all
his dreams a trap it had been a trap

  the professor had double-crossed him
had given him that shock deliberately to
destroy his intelligence perhaps even to
kill him to protect the interests of the
big awkward lumbering race of men from
intelligent mice

  ah yes the professor had been smart
mitkey thought bitterly and mitkey was
glad now that he had not called out bro-
fessor when it had come to him to do
so the professor was his enemy

  alone and in the dark he would have
to work minnie first of course create
one of the x- machines the prxlians
had showed him how to make and raise
minnies intelligence level then the two
of them-

  it would be hard working in secret
without the professors help to make that
machine but maybe   

  a bit of wire on the floor under the
workbench mitkey saw it and his bright
little eyes gleamed and his whiskers
twitched he waited until professor ober-
burger was looking the other way and
then softly ran toward the wire and with
it in his mouth he scurried for the hole
in the wall

stories

  the professor didnt see him

  und for der uldra-vafe brojector  

  mitkey safe in darkness with his bit
of wire a start more wire he would
need a fixed condenser-the professor
would have one surely a flashlight cell
-that would be hard to handle hed have
to roll it across the floor after the pro-
fessor was asleep and other things it
would take him days but what did time
matter

  the professor worked late that night
very late

  but darkness in the workshop came at
last darkness and a very busy little
mouse

and bright morning and the
ringing of a doorbell

  package for professor-uh-ober-
burger

  yah vot iss

  dunno from the hartford labora-
tories and they said to carry it careful

  holes in the package

  yah der mouse

  the professor signed for it and then
carried it into the workroom and un-
wrapped the wooden cage

  ah der vhite mouse liddle mouse
you are going a long long vay vhat shall
ve call you yet vhitey no vould you
vant some cheese vhitey

  yes whitey wanted cheese all right
he was a sleek dapper little mouse with
very close-set beady eyes and supercilious
whiskers and if you can picture a mouse
to be haughty whitey was haughty a
city-slicker type of mouse a blue-blood
of the laboratories who had never before
tasted cheese nothing so common and
plebian as cheese had entered his vitamin-
infested diet

  but he tasted cheese and it was camem-
bert good enough even for a blue-blood
and he wanted cheese all right he ate
with daintiness a well-bred sort of nibb-

  und now vhitey i show you i put
der pick-up by your cage to see if it
iss set to broadcast der vaint sounds you
make eating here i adchust-

  from the speaker on the corner table
a monstrous champing sound the magnifi-
cation a thousand times of the sound of
a mouse eating cheese

  yess it vorks you see vhitey i
eggsplain-vhen der rocket on der moon
lands der combartment door it opens but
you can nodt get out yet there vill be
bars of balsa vood you vill be able to

  und der sound of your gnawing vill
be on der ultra shordt-vafe to vhich i
shall stay duned-in see so vhen der
rocket lands i vill listen on my receifer
und if i hear you gnawing i vill know
you landed alife

  whitey might well have been appre-
hensive if he had understood what the
professor was saying but of course he
didnt he nibbled on at the camembert
in blissful supercilious indifference

  und it vill tell me if i am right about

der admosphere too vhitey vhen der

  yes the pick-up worked beautifully

  und now to install it der rocket

a day a night another day
another night

  a man working on a rocket and within
the wall behind him a mouse working even
harder to complete something much
smaller but almost equally as complex
planet

stories

the x- projector to raise the intelligence
of mice of minnie first

  a stolen pencil stub became a coil a
coil with a graphite core across the core
the stolen condenser nibbled to within a
microfarad of the exact capacity and from
the condenser a wire- but even mitkey
didnt understand it he had a blueprint
in his mind of how it was made but not
of why it worked

  und now der flashlight dry-cell vhich
i stole from der- yes mitkey too
talked incessantly to himself while he
worked but softly softly so the professor
wouldnt hear

  and from the wall the rumble of a
deeper gutteral voice

  und now to put der pick-up der com-
bartment in  

  of men and mice hard to say which
was the busier of the two

	 

  mitkey finished first the little x-
projector was not a thing of beauty to
the eye in fact it resembled the nucleus
of an electricians scrap pile most defin-
itely it was not streamlined and gleaming
like the rocket in the room outside the
wall it had rather a rube goldberg look
about it

  but it would work in every essential
detail it followed the instructions mitkey
had received from the prxlian scientists
the final wire so

und now to bring mine minnie 
she was cowering in the far corner of
the house as far as possible from those
strange neuric vibrations that were doing
queer things inside her head

  there was panic in her eyes as mitkey
approached sheer panic

  mine minnie nothing iss to be avraid
about you must closer come to der bro-
jector und then-und then you vill be an
indelligent mouse mine minnie you vill
dalk goot english like me yet

  for days now she had been puzzled and
apprehensive the strange actions of her
consort the strange noises he made that
were not sensible mouse-squeaks at all
terrified her now he was making those
weird noises at her

  mine minnie it iss all right to der
machine you must come closer und you

vill be able to dalk soon almost like me
minnie yess der prxls did things to
mine vocal chords so mine voice it sounds
bedder yet but effen mitout you vill be
able to-

  gently mitkey was trying to wedge his
way in behind her to push her out of the
corner and edge her in the direction of
the machine behind the wall of the next
room

  minnie squealed and then she ran

  but alas only a few feet toward the
projector and then she turned at right
angles through the hole in the baseboard
scurried across the kitchen floor and
through a hole in the screen of the kitchen
door outside and into the high unmown
grass of the yard

  minnie mine minnie come back

  and mitkey scurried after her too late

  in the foot-high grass and weeds he
lost her completely without a trace

  minnie minnie

  alas poor mitkey had he remembered
that she was still only a mouse and had
he squeaked for her instead of calling she
might have come out from her hiding
place

  sadly he returned and shut off the x-
projector

  later when she returned if she
returned he would figure some way
possibly he could move the projector near
her when she was asleep to play safe
he could tie her feet first so that if she
was awakened by the neuric vibrations   

night and no minnie

mitkey sighed and waited

  outside the wall the rumble of the
professors voice

  ach effen the bread iss all no food
und now i must go out und to der store
yet food it iss such a nuisance people
must eat vhen on something imbortant
they vorlc but-ach vhere iss mine hat 

  and the opening and closing of the
door

  mitkey crept to the mousehole this
was opportunity to look about out in the
work-shop to find a bit of soft string
that would serve to tie minnies dainty
little feet
mitkey rides again



  yes the light was on out there and
the professor was gone mitkey scurried
to the middle of the room and looked
around

  there was the rocket and it was fin-
ished as far as mitkey could see probably
now the professor was waiting until the
proper time to fire it against one wall
the radio equipment that would pick up
the automatic broadcast from the rocket
when it had landed

  lying on the table the rocket itself
beautiful shining cylinder which-if
the professors calculations were correct-
would be the first earth-sent object ever
to reach the moon

  it caught at mitkeys breath to look at

 it

  iss it nodt beautiful no

  mitkey jumped an inch up in the air
that had not been the professors voice
it was a strange squeaky grating voice
a full octave too high for a human larynx

  a shrill chuckle and did i vrighten
you 

  and mitkey whirled around again and
this time located the source of the voice
the wooden cage on the table something
white inside it

  a white paw reached through the bars
of the door the latch lifted and a white
mouse stepped out his beady-bright eyes
looked down a bit contemptuously at the
little gray mouse on the floor below

  you are this mitkey no of whom
der brofessor sbeaks

  yess said mitkey wonderingly und
you-ach yess i see vhat happened der
x- brojector it vas in der vail chust
oudside your cage und like me from
der brofessor you learned to dalk english
vhat iss your name 

   vhitey der brofessor calls me it vill
do vhat iss der x- brojector mitkey

  mitkey told him

  umm said whitey bossibilities i
bee many bossibilities much more bedder
than a drip to der moon vhat are your
blans for using der brojector

  mitkey told him the beady-bright eyes
of whitey grew brighter-and beadier
but mitkey didnt notice

  iff to der moon you are nodt going
mitkey said come down i vill show you

nojhing to do now but wait and hope

vhere to hide der vail inside

  nodt yet mitkey look at dawn
tomorrow takes off der rocket no hurry
iss soon der brofessor comes home he
vorks around a vhile und dalks und i
listen i learn more und a vhile he vill
sleep before dawn und then i eggscape
iss easy

  mitkey nodded dot iss smart budt
do nodt trust der brofessor if he learns
you are now indelligent he vill either
kill you or make sure you do nodt egg-
scape he is avraid of indelligent mice
ach vootsteps get back your cage in und
be careful

  and mitkey scurried toward the mouse-
hole then remembered the piece of string
and scurried back after it the tip of his
tail was just disappearing into the hole as
professor oberburger walked into the
room

cheese vhitey cheese i brought you
und to put in der combartment of der
rocket too so as you eadt on der vay you
haff been a goot liddle mouse vhitey
squeak

  the professor peered into the cage
almost i thingk you answer me vhitey
you did yess

  silence deep silence from the wooden
cage   


planet stories

mitkey waited and waited
longer

  no minnie

  der yard she iss hiding in he told
himself reassuringly she knows it iss
dangerous to come in vhen iss light vhen
dargkness comes-

  and darkness came

  no minnie

  it was as dark outside now as it was
within the wall mitkey sneaked to the
kitchen door and made sure that it was
open and that the hole was still there in
the bottom of the screen

  he stuck his head through the hole
and called minnie mine minnie and
then he remembered she did not speak
english and squeaked for her instead
but softly so the professor in the next
room would not hear him

  no answer no minnie

  mitkey sighed and scurried back from
dark corner to dark corner of the kitchen
until he had reached safety in the mouse-
hole

  just inside he waited and waited

  his eyelids grew heavy and dropped
and he slept deeply

  a touch awakened him and mitkey
jumped then he saw it was whitey

  shh said the white mouse der bro-
 fessor is asleep it iss almost dawn und
 he has his alarm glock set to go off in an
 hour yet then he vill find i am gone he
 may try to catch a mouse to use instead
 so ve must hide und not go outside

  mitkey nodded smart you iss vhitey
 but mine minnie -she iss-

  iss nothing ve can do mitkey vait
before ve hide show me der x- und
how it vorks

  i show you quick und then i hunt
minnie before der brofessor vakes it iss
here

  and mitkey showed him

  und how vould you reduce der power
mitkey so it vould not make a mouse
quite so indelligent as ve are

  like this said mitkey but vhy

  whitey shrugged i chust vondered
mitkey der brofessor gafe me a very
sbeeial kind of cheese something new
und i brought you a liddle piece to tty
eadt it und ien i vill help you find

minnie ve haff almost an hour yet
mitkey tasted the cheese iss nodt
new iss limburger but hass a very
vunny taste effen for limburger

  vhich do you like bedder

  i dont know vhitey i think i do
nodt like-

  iss an acquired taste mitkey iss
vonderful eadt it all und you vill like
it

  so to be polite and to avoid an argu-
ment mitkey ate the rest of it

  iss nodt bad he said und now ve
look for minnie

  but his eyes were heavy and he yawned
he got as far as the edge of the mouse-
hole

  vhitey i must rest a minute vill you
vake me in aboudt fife min-

  but he was asleep sound asleep
sounder asleep than he had ever been be-
fore he finished the sentence

  whitey grinned and became a very
busy little mouse

he ringing of an alarm clock
professor oberburger opened his
eyes sleepily and then remembered the
occasion and got hastily out of bed
within half an hour now the time

  he went out behind the house and
inspected the firing rack it was in order
and so was the rocket except of course
that the compartment door was open no
use to put the mouse in until the last
moment

  he went indoors again and carried the
rocket out to the rack fitted it very care-
fully into place and inspected the starter
pin all in order

  ten minutes better get the mouse

  the white mouse was sound asleep in
the wooden cage

  professor oberburger reached into the
cage carefully ach vhitey now for
your long long chourney boor liddle
mouse i vill not avaken you if i can help
more bedder you should sleep until der
cholt of der stardt avakens you

   gently very gently he carried his sleep-
ing burden out into the yard and put it in
the compartment

  three doors closed first the inner one
then the balsa grating then the outer one
mitkey rides again



all but the balsa grating would open
automatically when the rocket landed and
the radio pick-up would broadcast the
sound of the mouse chewing its way
through the balsa

  if there was atmosphere on the moon
if the mouse-

  eyes on the minute-hand of his watch
the professor waited then the second-
hand now-

  his finger touched the accurately-timed
delayed-action starter button and then
he ran into the house

 whooosh

  trail of fire into the air where the
rocket had been

  gootbye vhitey boor liddle mouse
but someday you vill be vamous almost
as vamous as mine star-mouse mitkey
vill be someday vhen i can bublish-
now for the diary entry of the depar-
ture

- the professor reached for his pen and
as he did so caught a glimpse of the inside
of his hand the hand that held the
mouse

  white it was perplexed he studied it
closer under the light

  vhite paint vhere vould i haff picked
up vhite paint  i haff some but i haff not
wed it nothing on der rocket nothing
in der room or der yard-

  der mouse vhitey i held him so
but vhy vould der laboratories send me
a mouse painted vhite i told them any
color vould do-

  then the professor shrugged and went
to wash his hands it was puzzling very
puzzling but it did not matter really
but why on earth would the laboratoriesi
have done that

	 

  but in the black compartment of the
roaring soaring rocket moon-bound and
bust

  doped limburger cheese

  black treachery

  white paint

  alas poor mitkey moonward-bound
without a ticket back

night and it had been raining in
hartford the professor hadnt been
able to follow the rocket through his tele-

scope

  but it was up there all right and going
strong

  the radio pick-up told him that roar
of the jets so loud he couldnt tell whether
or not the mouse inside was alive or not
but it probably was hadnt mitkey sur-
vived on the trip to prxl

  finally he turned off the lights to take
a cat-nap in his chair when he awoke
maybe the rain would have stopped

  his head nodded his eyes closed and
after a while he dreamed that he opened
them again he knew he was dreaming
because of what he saw

  four little white spots moving across
the floor from the door

  four little white spots that might have
been mice but couldnt be-unless they
were dream mice-because they moved
with military precision in an exact rect-
angle almost like soldiers

  and then a sound too faint for him to
distinguish and the four white spots
abruptly fell into a single file and disap-
peared one by one at precise intervals
against the baseboard

  the professor woke and chuckled to
himself

  vot a dream i go to sleep thinking
of der vhite mouse und vhite paint on
mein hands und i dream-

  he stretched and yawned and stood up

  but a small white spot a white some-
thing had just appeared at the baseboard
of the room again another joined it the
professor blinked his eyes and watched
them could he be dreaming standing up

  a scraping sound something being
shoved across the floor and as the first
two white spots moved away from the
wall two more appeared again in rect-
angular formation they started across the
floor toward the door

    and the scraping continued almost
as though the four-could they be white
mice-were moving something two of
them pulling it and two pushing

  but that was silly

  he reached out beside him for the
switch of the light and clicked it the
light momentarily blinded him

  stobp high and shrill and command-
ing


planet

stories

  the professor could see again now and
it was four white mice they had been
moving something a strange little object
fashioned around what looked like one of
the cells of his own pencil-type flashlight

  and three of the mice were now doing
the moving frantically and the fourth had
stepped between him and the strange ob-
ject it pointed what seemed to be a small
tube at the professors face

  if you moofe i gill you shrilled the
mouse with the tube

  it wasnt completely the threat of the
tube that kept the professor motionless
he was simply too surprised to move
was the mouse with the tube whitey
looked like him but then they all looked
like whitey and anyway whitey was on
his way to the moon

 but vot-who-vhy-

  the three mice with the burden were
even now vanishing through the hole in
the screen door the fourth mouse backed
after them

  just inside the screen door he paused
you are a vool brofessor he said
all men are vools ve mice vill take
care uf that

  and it dropped the tube and vanished
through the hole

  slowly the professor walked over and
picked up the weapon the white mouse had
dropped it was a match-stick not a tube
or a weapon at all just a burned safety
match

  the professor said but how-vhy-
he dropped the match as though it were
hot and took out a big handkerchief to
mop his forehead

 but how-und vhy-

  he stood there what seemed to be a
long time and then slowly he went to the
icebox and opened it back in a far cor-
ner of it was a bottle

  the professor was practically a teeto-
taler but there comes a time when even
a teetotaler needs a drink this was it
he poured a stiff one

	 

night and it was raining in hartford
old mike cleary watchman for the
hartford laboratories was taking a drink
too in weather like this a man with rheu-
matism in his bones needed a drink to

warm his insides after that walk across
the yard in the rain

  a foine night for ducks he said
and because that drink had not been the
first he chuckled at his own wit

  he went on into building number three
through the chemical stockroom the meter
room the shipping room his lantern
swinging at his side sent grotesque shad-
ows before him

  but these shadows didnt frighten mike
cleary hed chased them through this
building for nights of ten years now

  he opened the door of the live-stock
room to look in and then left it wide
behind him and went on in begorra
he said and how did that happen 

  for the doors of two of the large cages
of white mice were open wide open they
hadnt been open when hed made his last
round two hours before

  holding his lantern high he looked into
the cages they were both empty not a
mouse in either

  mike cleary sighed theyd blame him
for this of course

  well and let them a few white mice
werent worth much even if they took it
out of his salary sure let them take it
out if they thought it was his fault

  misther williams hed tell the boss
those doors were closed when i went
by the first time and open when i went
by the second and i say the catches on
them were worthless and dee-fective but
if you want to blame me sorr then just
deduct the value of the-

  a faint sound behind him made him
whirl around

  there in a corner of the room was a
white mouse or what looked like a white
mouse but it wore a shirt and trousers
and-

  ye gods said mike cleary and he
said it almost reverently is it the d ts
that im-

  and another thought struck him or
can it be sorr that you are one of the
little folk please sorr

  and he swept off his hat with a trem-
bling hand

  nudts said the white mouse and
like a streak it was gone

  there was sweat on mike clearys fore-
mitkey rides again



head and sweat trickling down his back
and under his armpits

got them he said oive got them

and quite illogically since that was
now his firm belief he took the pint bottle
from his hip pocket and finished the rest
of its contents at a single gulp

darkness and roaring

and it was the sudden cessation
of the roaring sound that wakened mit-
key wakened him to utter and stygian
slackness of a confined space his head
ached and his stomach ached

and then suddenly he knew where he
was the rocket

the jets had stopped firing and that
meant he was over the line and falling
falling toward the moon

but how- why-

  he remembered the radio pick-up that
would be broadcasting sounds from the
rocket to the professors ultra-shott-wave
receiver and he called out despairingly
brofessor brofessor oberburger help
it iss-

  and then another sound drowned him
out	

  a whistling sound a high shrill sound
that could only be the rush of the rocket
through air through an atmosphere

  the moon  was the professor right and
the astronomers wrong about the moon or
was the rocket falling back to earth

  at any rate the vanes were gripping
now and the rocket was slowing rather
than accelerating

  a sudden jerk almost knocked the
breath out of him the parachute vanes
were opening now if they would-


planet stories

  crash

  and again blackness behind the eyes of
mitkey as well as before them blackout
in blackness and when two doors clicked
open to admit light through balsa bars
mitkey did not see them

  not at first and then he wakened and
groaned

  his eyes came to focus first on the
wooden bars and then through them

  der moon he muttered he reached
through the balsa-bar gate and unlatched it
fearfully he stuck his little gray nose out
of the door and looked around

  nothing happened

  he pulled his head back in and turned
around to face the microphone

  brofessor can you hear me brofes-
sor iss me mitkey dot vhitey he
double-grosses us vhite paint i got on
me so i know vhat happened you vere
nodt in on it or der vhite paint vould not
be	

  it vas dreachery brofessor by mine
own kind a mouse i vas double-grossed
und vhitey- brofessor he has der x-
brojector now i am avraid vhat he may
be blanning iss wrong or he vould haf
told me no

  then silence and mitkey thinking
deeply

  brofessor i got to get back nodt for
me but to stop vhitey maybe you can
help loogk i can change der broadcaster
here into a receifer i think it should be
easy receifers are simpler no und you
quick build a ultra-shordt sender like this
vun

  yess i stardt now goot-bye bro-
fessor i change der vires

	 

  mitkey can you hear me mitkey

  mitkey loogk i giff instructions now
und i rebeat effery half hour for a vhile
in gase you gannot get der first time

  virst vhen you haf heard insdructions
shudt off der set to safe bower you vill
need all der bower left in der batteries to
stardt again so do not broadcast again
do nodt answer me

  aboudt aiming und calculating later
virst check der fuel left in der dubes
i used more than vas needed und i think
it vill be enough because to leaf der light-

grafity moon vill need much much less
bower than to leaf der earth und 
and over and over the professor re-
peated it there were gaps there were
things he himself could not know how to
do without being there but mitkey might
be able to find the answers

  over and over he repeated the adjust-
ments the angle of aiming the timing
everything except how mitkey could move
the rocket to turn it to aim it but mitkey
was a smart mouse the professor knew
maybe with levers somehow-if he could
find levers-

  over and over and far into the night
until the good professors voice was hoarse
with fatigue and until at last right in the
middle of the nineteenth repetition he
fell sound asleep

  bright sunlight when he awakened and
the clock on the shelf striking eleven he
rose and stretched his cramped muscles
sat down again and leaned forward to the
microphone

  mitkey can you-

  but no there was no use in that unless
mitkey had heard one of his earlier send-
ings the night before it would be too late
now mitkeys batteries-the rockets bat-
teries-would be worn out by now if he
still had the set connected

  nothing to do now but wait and hope
the hoping was hard and the waiting
was harder

  night day night and nights and
days until a week had gone by still no
mitkey

  again as once before the professor
had set his wire cage trap and caught
minnie again as before he took good
care of her

  mine minnie maybe soon your mitkey
vill be back mit us

  budt minnie vhy cant you dalk like
him yet  if he made an eggs- brojector
vhy did he nodt use it on you i do nodt
understand vhy

  but minnie didnt tell him why because
she didnt know she watched him sus-
piciously and listened but she wouldnt
talk not until mitkey got back did they
find out why and then-paradoxically-
only because mitkey had not yet taken time
to remove the white paint 
mitkey rides again	

mitkeys landing was a good
one he was able to crawl away
from it and after a while to walk

  but it had been in pennsylvania and
it had taken him two days to reach hart-
ford not afoot of course he had hidden
at a filling station until a truck with a
connecticut license had come along and
when it took on gasoline it took mitkey
too

  a last few miles on foot and then at
last-

  brofessor iss me mitkey

  mitkey mein mitkey almost i had
giffen up hope to see you tell me how
you-

  layder brofessor i tell you all lay-
der virst vhere iss minnie you haff

  in der cage mitkey i kept her safe

  and he opened the door of the wire
cage minnie came out hesitantly

  master she said and it was at
mitkey she was looking

  vot

  she repeated master you are a vhite
mouse i am your slafe

  vot said mitkey again and he
looked at the professor vot iss she

minnie said mitkey do you nodt

  mitkey nodded go back der cage in
he turned again to the professor you
see a liddle nodt mudch he raises der
lefel of indelligence of der gray mice der
zero-two leffel vhich iss his-so he iss
chusdt a liddle smarter than der other
vhite mice und many dimes as smardt as
der ordinary mice who they vill use as
solchers und vorkers iss diabolical no
it is diabolical mitkey i-i did not
thingk mice could be so low-so low as

  how mitkey

little gray man with his head
bent low over a white-painted little
gray mouse the two of them discussing
high heroism and the fate of the world
and neither saw that it was funny
-or was it

  how mitkey

  ve renew der vhite paint virst so i
can vool them und get by der guards it
vill be in or near der hartford labora-
tories i belief-vhere vhitey came from

  the professor nodded eggcellent
und der laboratories iss three miles avay
from here und der shordt vill nodt affect
minnie then she can restore you hein

  yess i need vire der vinest vire you
haff und-

  rapidly this time the projector grew
this time mitkey had help expert help
and could ask for what he wanted instead
of having to steal it in darkness

  once while they worked the professor
remembered something mitkey he said
suddenly you vere on der moon i al-
most forgodt to ask you aboudt it vot
vas it like

  brofessor i vas so vorried aboudt
getting back i did nodt notice i forgodt
to look

  and then the final connections which
mitkey insisted on making himself

  nodt that i do nodt trust you bro-
fessor he explained earnestly but it
vas a bromise to der prxlian scientists
who taught me und i do nodt know how
it vorks myself und you vould nodt un-

stories

derstand either it iss beyond der science
of men und mice but i bromised so i
make der connections alone

   i understand mitkey it iss all right
but der other brojector der vun you vill

rebair der shordt

   mitkey shook his head

   iss hobeless vunce it is ruined no vun
vill ever make head or tail of how it
vorked nodt effen you could brofessor
near the cage-now with the door
closed again-in which minnie waited the
final wire and a click

  and gradually minnies eyes changed
mitkey talking rapidly explaining to
her giving her the facts and the plans

under the floor of the main
building of the hartford labora-
tories it was dark but enough light came
through a few cracks for the keen eyes
of mitkey to see that the mouse who had
just challenged him was a white mouse
carrying a short club

  who iss

  iss me said mitkey i chust egg-
scaped vrom der big cage ubstairs vot
giffs

  goot said the white mouse i vill
take you to der emperor of der mices
to him und to der machine he made you
owe your indelligence und your alle-
chiance

  who iss he asked mitkey innocently
vhitey der first emperor of der vhite

  and mitkey followed the white mouse
as he followed he asked how many
of us intelligent vhite mice iss there
you vill be der twenty-virst

  und all tventy iss here

  yess und ve are draining der lafe
battalion of gray mice who vill vork und

mitkey rides again



  teri maybe tvelff yards

  iss goot said mitkey

  the last turn of the passage and there
was the machine and there was whitey
other white mice were seated in a semi-
circle around him listening

  -und der negst moof iss to- vot iss
this guard

and he moved around the semi-circle of
mice toward the machine

  iss so said whitey der hand higher

  dots vot you think said mitkey and
he reached in among the wires of the x-
projector and touched two of them to-
gether   

the professor and minnie

were waiting the professor seated
in his chair minnie on the table beside the
new projector mitkey had made before he
left

  three hours und tventy minutes said
the professor minnie do you subbose
anything could haff gone wrong

  i hobe nodt brofessor    brofessor
iss mice habbier mit indelligence  vould
nodt indelligent mice be unhabby 

you are unhabby mein minnie

  maybe minnie maybe only drouble
do brains bring to mice as to men
minnie

  but men they cannot help it bro-
fessor they are born that vay if it vas
meant for mice to be smardt they vould
be born so iss not

  the professor sighed maybe you are
a smardter mouse effen than mitkey und
i am vorried minnie aboudt- look iss
him

  small gray mouse most of the paint
worn off of him and the rest dirtied to his
own gray color slinking along the wall

  pop into the mouse-hole in the base-
board

  minnie iss him he sugceeded now
i set der cage drap so i can pudt him on
der table by der machine- or vait iss not
necessary it vill broject to affect mitkey
behind der vail chust svitch it on und-

  gootbye brofessor said minnie she
reached forward to the machine and too
late the professor saw what she was going
to do

  squeak

  and just a small gray mouse on a table
running frantically around looking for a
way down in the center of the table a
small complex short-circuited machine
that would never work again

  squeak

  the professor picked her up gently

  minnie mein minnie yess you vere
right you und mitkey vill be habbier so
but i vish you had vaited-chust a liddle
i vanted to talk to him vunce more
minnie but-

  the professor sighed and put the gray
mouse down on the floor

  veil minnie now to your mitkey you
can-

  but instructions were too late and quite
unnecessary even if minnie had under-
stood them the little gray mouse was now
a little gray streak in the direction of the
baseboard mousehole

  and then from a sheltered darkness
deep within the wall the professor
heard two joyful little squeaks   
   the last

 aram jerrold watched helplessly as santanes beast-rockets screamed
 into the void bearing madness to the thirty suns and knew that this was
 cosmic armageddon   the crimson horror of space-war would smash
 galactic civilization utterly and forever yet in his tortured mind a voice
 from the past commanded you must save something from the ruins


two alivei

the verdict thought

aram jerrold wearily would be
death the supreme council itself
would demand it he had rebelled against
the tetrarchy-rebelled senselessly des-
perately without hope of success or escape
-and the reckoning had come the gov-

ernment of the thirty suns would demand
his life    more if the science of the
security police were up to it aram re-
pressed a shudder he knew that science
well no one rose to a position of com-
mand in the thirty sims navy or to mem-
bership in the executive committee of


planet stories



the tetrarchy without respect for the
methods of the dread greens

  the courtroom was dark a pattern of
sombre hues calculated to impress a pris-
oner with the futility of hope it had been
weeks since jerrold had seen the sun
weeks of endless interrogation and re-
peated narcosynthesis he had been shunted
from bureau to bureau from department
to department each set of cogs in the vast
governmental machinery of the terminus
probing him for evidence of sabotage or
rebellion within its own structure he had
been badgered beaten drugged and
threatened now at last the end of the
ordeal seemed near there remained only
the sentence of death to be passed-the
method and place decided upon-and it
would be done with the ponderous bu-
reaucracy of the tetrarchy had wrung him
dry and now it prepared to cast him aside
satisfied that his rebellion was a purely
personal aberration and not part of a
widespread plot against the stability of
galactic tyranny

  the drugs had clouded his vision giving
a nightmare mistiness to the shadowy
courtroom jerrold could see that the room
was empty but for the guards and clerks
and the black-masked tribunes it would
not do of course to let the people know
that one of the chosen masters-a member
of the executive committee-had sud-
denly become an insubordinate rebel and
traitor

  behind him a door opened splitting the
gloom with a fleeting wedge of light the
wedge vanished and aram jerrold heard
again the light crisp footsteps he knew
without looking that it was deve jennet
she had been in the courtroom every day
giving testimony slamming doors in his
face doors that might possibly have led
to freedom every day she had driven
another rivet into the chains of evidence
that bound him methodically deliberately

  she passed by him without turning her
head and took a seat near the tribunes dais
jerrold stared at her through the mist that
swam sickeningly before his eyes dimly
the memory of her as she had been before
this nightmare came to him he remem-
bered her soft and yielding in his arms
through the long nights of terminus

nights filled with tenderness and longing
talk of freedom for the two of them some-
where beyond the stars

  this was the same woman but changed
the lustrous dark eyes were the same and
the full lips the same pale hair and slim
body but it sat encased in a severely cut
uniform all femininity gone from it the
uniform was green the hated color of the
security police   

  jerrold had heard again all the words
that he had spoken to her through those
nights only this time the words had been
retold to three masked judges and their
clerk this time the words had had a
ring of doom

  at first aram had suffered the tortures
of the damned wondering why deve had
betrayed him he had known well enough
her high connections in the supreme
council and he had known that she served
as a member of the greens but he had
imagined that she loved him and he had
been stupid enough to trust her now
after weeks of ordeal it seemed to matter
no longer jerrold wanted only to rest

on the dais one of the black-
masked figures was speaking aram
leaned forward painfully to catch what
was being said

  this court wishes to go on record as
favoring a severe reprimand for the bu-
reau of psychometrics personnel involved
in the testing of aram jerrold his inher-
ent instability should have been uncovered
long before he was appointed to the ex-
ecutive committee only the chance use of
a mental probe on him-at the request of
the security police- he nodded toward
deve jennet -prevented serious incon-
venience to the government of the thirty
suns such negligence cannot be tolerated
in so vital a bureau

  he paused while the clerk recorded his
remarks then continued aram jerrold
you have been convicted of treason against
the government of the thirty suns you
have been proved guilty of attempting to
use your position as an officer of the
thirty suns navy to steal a spacecraft
and escape from the dominance of your
government you have disgraced your uni-
form and your high office as a member of
the last two alive



the executive committee of the supreme
council of the government of the thirty
suns- the hooded man rolled the son-
orous phrases off his tongue with obvious
relish have you anything to say before
the sentence of the court is passed
jerrold looked at deve jennet she sat
motionless her body tense in the green
police uniform it was hard for jerrold
to speak the druggings and violent inter-
rogations had left him weak yet a spark
of rebellion remained enough to lash out
against his tormentors for one last time

  i  i want only to say he began
thickly that    what i have done   
i would do again gladly i was sick of
oppression    tired of not    daring
even to think a thought of my own sick of
pompous bureaucratic tyranny    jer-
rold drew a shuddering breath the tet-
rarchy rules thirty star-systems    but
thirty star systems are not the universe
somewhere i thought    there must be
freedom my crime    was failure   
nothing more

  enough the tribunes voice shook
with sudden anger this court is not con-
vened to listen to treasonous tirades  the
clerk will strike the prisoners remarks
from the record

  darkness flickered momentarily at the
edges of jerrolds field of vision he felt
spent by his effort at defiance he forced
himself to stand erect

  the sentencing will proceed

  the prisoner will face the standard
intoned the clerk

aram raised his eyes to the

hated symbol on the wall behind the
judges dais long habit made him square
his shoulders under the tattered remains
of his blue uniform he stared up at the
standard of the tetrarchys spaceship and
sun despising everything it stood for

  aram jerrold traitor and rebel you
are sentenced by this court to death by
slow disintegration for the safety of the
tetrarchy

  the words fell like stones from the lips
of the masked tribune into the fragile
silence of the vaulted chamber

  in spite of himself jerrold flinched
sometimes men survived weeks of torment

under the cancerous rays of the disinteg-
rators   

  one of the judges spoke in low tones to
his colleagues

  we have received a request from kai-
dor v gentlemen provincial governor
santane asks that this sentence be com-
muted to life imprisonment on kaidor v
so that the prisoner may be used in some
experimental work now in progress there

  aram could feel his stomach muscles
tightening and the weakness seeping into
his knees the disintegrators would be
preferable to becoming an experimental
animal on kaidor v the kaidor province
was the farthest of the thirty suns and
the arsenal of the tetrarchy the ghastli-
est of the tetrarchys weapons came from
kaidor and they had to be tested there
 on living men

  it seems muttered one of the tribunes
pettishly that every time a naval officer
is convicted of anything a request comes
through from kaidor that he be turned
over to santane one would imagine
governor santane is building a navy
he shuffled the papers before him while
the others waited still he continued
thoughtfully it would be politically un-
wise to execute this prisoner here on ter-
minus the spacemen of his command are
based here and there is no point in stirring
up trouble in the fleet  i am inclined
to recommend acceptance of this offer to
take him off our hands

  objection sirs jerrold looked about
to see that deve jennet was on her feet
addressing the members of the tribunal

  as you know sirs she was saying
crisply i have the good fortune to be one
of the lesser members of the executive
committee in my office as liason officer
from security i feel it only fair to warn
you that the supreme council would be
extremely displeased if this prisoner
should escape with his life it is felt that
an example must be made of him if it
is unwise to carry out the sentence here
on terminus i will be happy to arrange
a transfer to altmion iv on the green
planet there will be no possibility of
trouble by fleet members i must insist
that you accede to the wishes of the
council aram jerrold must die in the
i

	planet

disintegrators no other course of action
will be acceptable to the supreme coun-
cil 

  the three judges conferred among
themselves and then the senior spoke
again the tone of his voice indicated all
too well the awe in which the supreme
council and all its appendages was held
by members of the judicial department
of the thirty suns government

  this court was not aware that the
supreme council had any special desires
concerning the disposition of this case
had it been known to us earlier we would
not have considered even for a moment
the request of provincial governor san-
tane

   the supreme council gentlemen re-
turned deve jennet stiffly has an interest
in this case as i have indicated to you it
has been communicated to you in the prop-
er time and form i await your action on it
of course leader jennet of course
it was not our intention to question the
policies of the council the judge sig-
nalled the guards

  aram jerrold is hereby remanded to
the custody of the security police to be
transported by first available spaceship to
atmion iv there to be put to death in the
manner prescribed by directive -a-
governing execution of convicted persons
above the rank of commander remove
the prisoner

  aram passed near deve jennet as she
replied it will be so reported gentle-
men and then looking somberly at jer-
rold she added i myself will go to
atmion iv to see to it that this prisoner
is accorded the treatment he deserves
aram stumbled out of the courtroom
under guard deves final words rang
strangely in his ears a perplexing threnody
of the dreams they had shared in the
hazy past he had the odd feeling that in
spite of the things that had passed the
end was not yet   

	 

  of the flight out to atmion jerrold
remembered almost nothing the iron de-
termination that had kept him on his feet
during the last days of his trial failed him
at last and the reaction of the drugging

stories

he had suffered hit him    hard he
writhed in the agonies of addiction for the
duration of the trip out from terminus
he knew vaguely that he lay in the prison
ships infirmary strapped to a bunk the
discomforts of acceleration and the shift
into second-stage flight above light speed
added themselves to his tortures and filled
his nightmares with nauseating spectres
for two weeks jerrold went through sheer
hell as his drug-saturated system screamed
for more narcotics none were given

  by the time the huge prison ship
touched down on the dread world of the
greens aram jerrold was on his way
back spent weak and emaciated he heard
the landing alarms and knew that he would
live to face the disintegrators

atmion iv the only habitable planet
of a star-system bizarre and hateful
three suns in the smoky sky air that
tasted of brimstone and ashes heavy
deadening gravity a world of hot rain
that fell daily out of the hazy cloud can-
opy a desert at periaston and quagmire
at apastron barren ground and a turbu-
lent sulphuric sea

  the three suns blazed through the over-
cast as the prison ship settled into the
steaming mud that was the spaceport
scalding rain sluiced down the long flanks
of the vessel corrosive and fetid

  aram jerrold knew of atmion iv no
officer in the fleet did not it was a foul
planet a world unwanted by any of the
many bureaus and as such the perfect
prison world the planet of the greens
on all its vast hulk there was only one
settlement the green fortress political
exiles and condemned prisoners from all
over the tetrarchy of the thirty suns
were brought to the fortress on atmion

iv	none ever returned

  aram remembered that atmion lay in
the twenty ninth decant only four light
years from kaidor on the very periphery
of the tetrarchy these were the outpost
systems the suns far from mighty ter-
minus and the center of the teeming life of
the galaxy these were the hinterlands
of empire sullen unknown unwanted

  the green fortress proper stood on a
high crag etched against the smoky grey
the last two alive



of atmion ivs eternal overcast standing
in the open port of the prison ship jerrold
could see the black bulk of the turreted
stronghold through the curtain of driving
rain the spaceport was a sea of mud that
still boiled in places from the heat of the
great starships landing jets

   chained in a long line the human cargo
 of the vessel was herded through the rain
 and mud toward an electrified wire enclo-
 sure aram smiled wryly at that evidence
 of security what need was there for it
 on this world  where could a prisoner go
 if he should find himself on the other side
 of the wire barrier it was likely jerrold
 thought that there was a directive on it
 from terminus and that accounted for
 the electrified wire

   he estimated that there were perhaps
 nine hundred men and women in the
 human chain that stretched from the star-
 ship to the long reception buildings within
 the enclosure the chaff of heterodoxy-
 cast off by the single-track machinery of
 galactic bureaucracy

   the greens drove the sodden prisoners
 through the gates without rancor or inter-
 est it was as though the prisoners had
 ceased to be human once they crossed the
 line that excluded them from the society
 of free men

   inside the long draughty shelters the
 prisoners were stripped naked men and
 women alike run through cleansing water
 jets dried clothed and photographed
 then they were broken into groups and
 registered by greens sitting in armored
 cubicles within the walls there was a
  machine-like efficiency to the bureaucratic
 procedure on this level aram jerrold had
 the impression that the operation would
 continue to run by sheer momentum
  should higher authority suddenly try to
 halt it   

 jerrold presented himself before a
 green of about forty a man with a
 thin tired face and colorless eyes who
 codified the information given him look-
 ing up at the prisoner with no apparent
 interest quite abruptly he emerged from
 his cubicle signalling another green to
 take his place

  -planet stories-november

  you he said tf aram come with
me

  jerrold followed the green out of the
reception building and out into the rain
for a wild moment aram had the impulse
to try an escape but the thought died
stillborn escape was plainly impossible
there was simply no place to go-even if
he could shake free of his guard and
the others stationed about the enclosure
the prison ship was being refuelled a
short distance from the reception pen but
the valves were closed and guarded

  presently jerrold and his guide reached
a shaft imbedded in the side of the crag
atop which sat the grim fortress aram
turned his eyes upward the great bas-
tioned stronghold seemed to crouch on
the crest of the cliff on the highest turret
a green banner emblazoned with a golden
spaceship and sun hung sodden and limp
in the falling rain

  with no hesitation the green stationed
at the guard-post by the shaft entrance
signalled aram and his guide through
there was a short walk up a spiralling
ramp and then they stood before what
appeared to be simply a blank wall jer-
rold stared in perplexity as his guard took
a bit of metal from his tunic and held it
to the wall

  isotope said the guard shortly it
acts as a key to the scanner    below

  before aram could question him the
section of wall slid back soundlessly and
they stepped into a tubecar quickly the
green set up a complicated series of stops
on the tubecar controls and the vehicle
started downward with a rush

  aram clutched at the man for support
something was not as it should be then
quite suddenly he realized what it was
the tubecar was travelling down    and
the fortress lay above

  where are we going he asked cau-
tiously

  the green shook his head

  arent the condemned cells above in
the fortress

  be quiet talk is dangerous

  but   

  be quiet the green said again youll
understand soon enough we have to be
careful not all of us here are of the
	planet

group he turned his hack on jerrold

  arams head was spinning what was
there on atmion that a green need fear
and what was this    group

  with a wisdom bom of his long impris-
onment aram jerrold decided to hold his
peace what would be would be and it was
becoming increasingly plain that he was
about to learn of things that he had not
dreamed existed

  after what seemed to be an intermin-
able period the tubecar began to slow the
hum of atomics died and the car came
to a stop they must be well below the
level of the fortress now reflected jer-
rold and very likely under the sea the
panels slid away and in front of them
stretched a long white corridor lighted
by dim bulbs set in the curved ceiling

  there are miles of tubeways down
here said the guard and only the
isotope key gives entrance the central
pattern on the tubecar has been altered too
   for the safety of the group follow
me

  at the end of the corridor a steelite
door barred further progress the green
produced his isotope key again and
touched it to the metal

  a word of advice he said to jer-
rold coolly listen and believe a great
many risks have been taken and a vast
amount of work done to bring you this
far

  he leaned forward and shoved the metal
door open within lay a brightly lit cham-
ber the glare of it hurt jerrolds eyes and
he stood a moment blinking on the thresh-
old slowly as his eyes accustomed them-
selves to the light aram became aware of
a group of men and women who watched
him impassively there were a few in
fleet uniform one or two of them casual
acquaintances he had thought lost in space
or imprisoned by the greens there were
others in prison garb and here and there
he could see the dread color of the secur-
ity police his heart began to pound an-
other trap but why r

  one slight figure in green stood a little
apart watching him through shadowed
eyes jerrold felt the breath catch in his
throat

  it was deve jennet

stories

with a cry deve ran to him
jerrold felt a surge of mixed fury
and desire almost defensively he lifted
his hand and struck deve across the face

  she gasped and stepped back eyes sud-
denly bright with tears a thin streak of
blood marking her pale face the gathered
strangers muttered angrily aram turned
to stare at them his face set and grim
anger was pulsing within him a deep
consuming anger born of the tortures he
had suffered-he looked at the stunned
girl-because of her

  oh aram    what have they done
to you whispered deve

  what have they done to me  he asked
thickly they now tell me you had no
part in it he was hemmed in lost in
a sea of treachery and formless dangers
for a few moments he had dared to let
himself hope    and this was the end
of it deve again and another trap
what more do you want from me is
this just entertainment for you to raise
my hopes and then step on them again
maybe youd like to open my veins and
have a drink of my blood

  aram    stop it

  you lying cheating wench was it
you that brought me to the fortress
was it you that spilled all my stupid
dreams to those black ghouls who tried
me he asked bitterly

  yes yes it was me sobbed deve
but can you listen to me aram i beg
you listen to me

  aram felt some of the rage draining
out of him he stared at deve in confu-
sion there were tears streaking her face
there was no reason for her to cry now
he thought heavily her job was done
done well

  i had to do it that way aram you
cant know how ive suffered for you   
every minute of the time but it had to be
done i swear it there was no other way
i could get you here to the group
if i had let you go your own way
youd have been killed aram id have
died with you gladly but there are other
things that must be done and we can live
aram do you understand me we can
live

  jerrold looked about him the group
tbe last two alive



had gathered around him someone said
listen to deve jennet jerrold

  dave stepped close to him again her
face upturned he felt again the old desire
for her even here-now did it matter
that she had betrayed him did anything
matter any more to him the last ebb of
fury flowed out of him leaving him silent
and relaxed at last if this was a trap   
what did it matter  he had nothing to lose
now

  he realized quite suddenly then that he
wanted very much to believe what deve
said he wanted it so badly that he re-
acted defensively not daring to let himself
be hurt by her again very cautiously he
let down the barriers that he had erected
against her since the very first day of the
trial when he had known for the first
time that she had been his betrayer

  deve sensed the change in him and
laid a hand on his arm you    you will
listen now she asked quietly

  aram nodded his eyes fixed on her
face the bruise on her lips was dark and
painful looking

  i heard of your arrest the day it hap-
pened aram she said i knew what
the end of it would be if they could find no
real evidence against you-youd have been
subjected to an extensive mental probing
that would have left you  an  an
idiot thats true you know it is

  aram nodded agreement

  you would have been lost to us deve
said and aram we need you need you
desperately

  aram looked about him in confusion
still weak from his bout with the drugs
he was having difficulty marshalling his
thoughts

  who are you people he demanded
what are you

grizzled naval officer
stepped forward aram recognized
him as kant mikal recorded in the head-
quarters of the thirty suns navy as hav-
ing been lost in space two years earlier
while on a routine exploration into the
thirtieth decant

  we have no name other than the
group he said simply we have as
our purpose the prevention of a disas-

trous war    possibly even the destruction
of civilization as we have known it
you dont make any sense jerrold
said confusedly what is there in the
galaxy that can threaten the tetrarchy
with a war such as you describe

  there is a very real and present dan-
ger aram jerrold mikal said flatly
santane  

  aram felt a chilling premonition san-
tane again he remembered the testy words
of the black judge who had condemned
him one would think santane were
building a fleet   

  mikal seemed to read his thoughts
yes he said provincial governor
santane

  i dont ask you to join us for the sake
of the tetrarchy aram pleaded deve
jennet earnestly or because of any per-
sonal relationship between you and me if
the thirty suns government knew of the
group and of the manipulations weve
performed to get equipment and personnel
for our mission not one of us would be
left alive by the greens weve penetrated
the highest circles weve subverted loyal
people weve used every trick and sub-
terfuge to get the men and women we
need out here without giving away our
secret she smiled ruefully weve even
had men arrested and condemned so that
we could gather them here on atmion
iv   

  aram felt a terrible load being lifted
from his shoulders no matter what hap-
pened next it was good to know that
deve had not betrayed him as he had
thought

  the tetrarchy would not allow the
existence of such a unit as the group for
a moment every hour that passes in-
creases our danger but we must finish our
mission aram we can do nothing else
deve said fervently

  if santane overthrows the tetrarchy
said kant mikal bleakly the dark ages
will descend the man is mad for power
cruel and intelligent enough to hold it
aram thought swiftly santane was a
relative unknown back on terminus was
merely one of the thirty civil servants that
held the governorships of the thirty star-
systems making up the tetrarchy the
	planet

tetrarchy was a tyrannous bureaucracy
 but at least it was rot a one-man gov-
ernment as bad as it was santanes iron
hand would be infinitely worse

  but how protested jerrold with
what  how can santane hope to withstand
the whole of the tetrarchys power
as you have guessed mikal said he
is building a fleet new construction and
better than anything in the thirty suns
navy however if it were only that there
would be no real need for us to interfere
the fleet is antiquated as you kndw but
able to muster a force of more than ten
thousand first line battlecraft no matter
how good santanes ships might be they
could not handle an attack by that kind
of numbers the kaidor system would
take a terrible beating and most probably
kaidor v would be bombed to rubble
that would be the end of it the destruc-
tion would be strictly localized in the
thirtieth decant but there is unfortun-
ately more    much more

  aram exclaimed deve its hor-
rible

  santane has developed interstellar
guided missiles jerrold said kant mikal
faster than any fleet vessel and impos-
sible to intercept but that isnt the worst
of it its the stuff he has developed for
these missiles to carry   

 biological weapon asked aram
with a sinking feeling in his heart

  mikal nodded follow me he said

aram jerrold followed the
grizzled naval officer into an ante-
chamber with deve jennet at his side he
let mikal lead him down a narrow zig-
zagging ramp into a stone room- below the
meeting hall the place was dimly lit and
there was a smell in the air that reminded
aram of a zoological garden a strong
wire mesh had been stretched across the
room to divide it roughly into two sections
in the corner of the interior division a
figure squatted gnawing on a piece of
bone the sound of its teeth scraping the
bits of flesh off the shank made aram
shudder

  mikal led him up to the wire

  that he said was a man santanes
weapon did what you see there

stories

  jerrolds stomach muscles knotted the
figure in the cage was roughly human but
it squatted on greatly foreshortened hams
and waved long hairy arms at them
angrily the forehead sloped back from
a face completely bestial and as aram
stood there sickened and fascinated the
hirsute apparition flung the chewed bone
at him and bared its fangs in a blood-
chilling howl

  aram turned away white-faced is   
is there no cure for this thing he asked

  mikal shook his head we have been
able to develop none this was an agent
of ours who was taken on kaidor iv by
santanes raiders we tried to establish a
surveillance point there and failed-the
planet is hardly livable-and santane lias
been able to maintain a very complete
coverage of the two planets nearest his
capital the inoculation was made on
kaidor v and santane sent him back here
thinking him an agent of the greens he
is laying the foundations of his psychologi-
cal attack you see a few cases like this
and then the shocker-the announcement
that every planet in the thirty suns can
expect an attack by guided missiles loaded
with that virus unless his demands are
acceded to

  but surely there must be a specific for
this thing pursued aram it would be
valueless as a weapon unless there is

  the virus attacks the higher cerebral
centers first explained mikal then the
endocrine balance first memory goes
qur medical people believe that santane
has an antidote for this thing but in very
limited amounts they tell me that if
caught soon enough it can be stopped
but within hours after infection perman-
ent damage to the higher nervous system
is done they suspect that even if a very
small amount of serum is introduced into
the body after infection physical damage
can be completely avoided what the effect
on the mind might be they do not care
to say complete loss of memory certainly
a lessening of the ability to relearn the
forgotten is also probable

  the creature behind the wire howled
again plaintively now

  lets get out of here breathed deve
faintly
the last two alive



	 

  you see what santane will use to
seize the tetrarchy mikal went on when
they were once again in the meeting hall
he imagines that the mere threat of it
will subdue the supreme council

  but thats wrong exclaimed aram
the tetrachy will fight there has
never been a bureaucracy in the history
of mankind that didnt imagine itself in-
vincible 

  yes the tetrarchy will fight agreed
mikal and a war of absolute destruction
will engulf the thirty suns unless  

unless what demanded jerrold

  unless santane can be convinced of
that unless he can be prevailed upon to
give up his ambition and content him-
self with being a balance for the rest of
the tetrarchys power where theres one
power only tyranny results invariably
but if there are two co-equal and autono-
mous then they must compete for the
favor of the people only in such a way
can the civilization of the thirty suns
survive and the slavish lot of the people
of the inhabited worlds be improved

  that then is the purpose of the
group we are pledged to stop-if we
can-the impending struggle for power
between santane and the tetrarchy sav-
agery is the price we will pay for failure

in the days that followed aram
jerrold grew to despise the name of
santane more than he had ever despised
the tetrarchy deep under the turbulent
sea of atmion iv he rested-recuperat-
ing from his ordeals and making ready
for the time when the small band of
peacemakers would move to forestall san-
tanes bid for galactic dominion

  the plan as kant mikal outlined it
was simple and direct in the colony
under the sea there were forty-five men
and women these were mainly scientists
and soldiers who had incurred the wrath
of the government of the thirty suns
though there were some like leader deve
jennet of the security police who carried
on a double existence on atmion iv liv-
ing both above in the green fortress and
in the tunnels   

  of the more than three thousand
greens stationed on the prison planet
some fifty knew of the group and of the
fifty perhaps ten had access to the secret
quarters these greens at great personal
risk supplied the scientists and workers
of the group with the materials needed
for their medical and physical researches

  a falsified report of aram jerrolds
death under the disintegrators was sent to
terminus under the personal cachet of
leader deve jennet of the security po-
lice so for the first time in many weeks
aram had a semblance of peace

  mikals plan was for the group to di-
vide into two units one the larger of the
two would go-at the proper time-to
kaidor v there to establish contact with
the provincial governor and try by any
means to dissuade him from his plan to
defy the thirty suns government there
were several among the group who felt
that such an approach to santane would
succeed where harsher methods might well
fail in the face of the thirtieth decants
hidden power it was mikals plan-to lead
this delegation himself in a starship now
being fitted in the central pit of the tun-
nel maze

  but kant mikal did not delude him-
self that santane could be won by argu-
ments another expedition to the kaidor
sun would be dispatched at the same
time a small two-man destroyer that had
been rendered-mikal claimed-unde-
tectable would leave the atmion system
with the larger vessel and land on kaidor
iii a planet uninhabited save for a few
bands of degenerated experimental sub-
jects dumped there by santanes bio-
logical ecologists mikal took care
to point out that kaidor iii had two
large land-masses and the landing by the
two members of the group selected for
that duty would be made on the land-mass
unoccupied by the unfortunate subhu-
mans

  this expedition would remain on kai-
dor iii to await word from the first as
to the success or failure of the groups
plan failing to hear from them or hear-
ing of failure the small ship would pro-
ceed to kaidor v and try to wrest the sec-
ret of the virus weapon from santane

stories

plainly enough the second expedition into
the thirtieth decant would be a last spas-
modic attempt to save something from
the ruins of galactic war that phrase
stayed with jerrold as he listened to kant
mikal to save something from the ruins
that he told himself might well be the
best the group could accomplish with
their meager resources

during the hours that deve
was working in the fortress jerrold
wandered freely through the maze of un-
derground tunnels and chambers that the
group had built the original catacombs
had been built a thousand years earlier
and the men and women of the group had
expanded and refurbished the forgotten
maze to suit their purposes jerrold was
continually amazed at what they had been
able to accomplish with so little at their
command and under a shroud of almost
complete secrecy

  life in the tunnels centered on the cen-
tral pit-the spaceport this as kant mi-
kal explained with considerable pride was
connected with the surface by a series of
locks that emerged through the bottom
of the sea in the offshore shallows down
the coast from the green fortress under
cover of night a spaceship could emerge
from the tunnels and lift into space with-
out arousing the garrison of greens who
served on atmion iv never dreaming of
the quiet life beneath their feet

  two spacecraft rested in their cradles
in the pit a medium sized merchantman
the star cluster and a fleet scout-
destroyer serpent jerrold recognized
both vessels as craft that had long ago
been reported lost in space in admiralty
headquarters back on terminus the ser-
pent still carried its fleet insigne of the
spaceship and sun a reminder to
aram of his former life and of the im-
mense power of the thirty suns navy
he knew only too well the position of the
group in the coming silent struggle be-
tween the galactic tetrarchy and the
rebellious santane they were the small-
est weakest corner in a vicious triangular
madness that threatened to smash the
entire civilization of the thirty suns

  his personal happiness at being with

deve jennet again and free of the haunt-
ing pain of her supposed betrayal was
mitigated by a realization of the dangers
they would soon face when the groups
quixotic plan wait into operation nor
were these forebodings lessened when
kant mikal informed him that he and
deve were the unanimous choices of the
group for the second-and secret-ex-
pedition into the kaidor province

  it will be your purpose kant mikal
told him again to save something from
the wreckage if all else fails   

	 

  aram lay comfortably under the bank
of sun-lamps in the underground infirm-
ary the days of rest and treatment had
brought him back into condition again
and he felt fit and ready for action he
had begun to chafe at the inactivity but
kant mikal insisted that the time to move
out against kaidor had not come and jer-
rold was forced to be content with the
older mans judgment

  deve sat with him in the infirmary her
slim body golden under the glowing lamps
sitting near her watching the graceful
sweep of her pale hair as it brushed her
shoulders aram was filled with a sense
of well-being and contentment

  aram asked deve have you had
time to examine the serpent are you
familiar with that class of ship

  i spent three years on periphery pa-
trol with serpent class scouts deve
murmured aram sleepily there wont
be any trouble   he stretched himself
and sat up but theres one thing id
like more information on  if i can
be trusted with it

  aram we trust you you know we
do    protested deve

  kant mikal told me the serpent was
   undetectable in all my years with the
fleet i never heard of a spaceship that
could not be detected

  avon marsh-one of our scientists-
has developed an energy shield aram
thats nothing new deve said
aram the fleet vessels have had them
for years they use them against attack
by ray weapons of all kinds

but this reaches into the highest fre-
the last two alive



queticies deve explained it shunts all
radiation around the ship of course it
cant be used during second order flight
above light speed but it wouldnt be of
any value then anyway

  you mean it shunts all radiation
around the ship all even light de-
manded jerrold with sudden interest

  yes at close observational ranges it
results in a slight distortion-like a very
clear lens but-

  then the ship is    invisible aram
asked incredulously

  deve jennet smiled yes among other
things and it prevents a radio echo being
sent back to a detector too

aram sank back thoughtfully

an invisible ship his spacemans
mind toyed with the thought it was like
something from a naval officers dream
fantasies a battleship so equipped could
very nearly rule the plenum   but
deves next words cut that dream short

  the field is so limited though she
said that only a two-man scout can be
equipped with it and since the shield
works two ways the occupants of the ship
are blind nothing outside the ship itself
can be seen

  jerrold was about to reply when kant
mikal burst into the room his grey hair
was matted with blood and his face was
pale and drawn with pain and -anxiety

  i should have listened to you jerrold
he breathed heavily we should have
moved out long ago

  kant youre hurt cried deve

  mikal gestured impatiently its no-
thing we have to get out immediately
get ready   

  jerrold and deve were on their feet
reaching for their cloaks

  whats happened asked aram

  the greens have found the tunnel en-
trance i think they must have caught one
of our topside people with a mental probe
i dont know for sure but theres fighting
in the tube-shafts now we have to get to
the ships

  aram cursed are there any weapons
nearby 

  the grey haired officer shook his head

none only the medical instruments
here

  aram ransacked the wall cabinets and
produced a single small scalpel this will
have to do he muttered-

  if we can reach the pit said kant
mikal the steelite doors may give us
enough time to get clear theyre disin-
tegrator-resistant

  lets go said aram tensely ready

  deve and mikal nodded and followed
him as he opened the door to the corridor
and stepped out the tunnel was deserted
but there were muffled sounds of fighting
coming through the ventilators aram
sprinted toward the pit his bare feet
soundless on the stone floor deve and
mikal ran silently beside him

  as they came to a turn in the tube a
single green seemed to appear out of
nowhere aram had a fleeting glimpse of
a pistol being raised and he felt the hot
searing touch of a graze as he launched
himself bodily at the man

  there was a crashing roar as the tetrol
shell exploded harmlessly against the stone
wall of the tunnel sending echoes rever-
berating down the long passageway aram
caught the green in the pit of the stomach
withthe full force of his charge the man
doubled up painfully dropping his weapon
to the floor aram rolled to his feet cat-
like the green roared with rage and
lunged at him aram stepped under the
attack and brought his two clenched fists
down on the back of the mans neck the
green staggered and spun about catching
aram in a vise-like embrace the police-
man was huge and as his arms closed
about arams lighter frame aram could
feel his ribs being crushed his hand
closed on the scalpel he had thrust into the
waistband of his shorts he raised it high
and drove it hard into the mans broad
back the green stiffened with an incred-
ulous expression he released aram and
toppled to the stone floor

  aram leaned against the wall of the
tunnel panting sickened his hands were
red with blood from somewhere down the
tunnel came the sound of booted feet clat-
tering on- thie stones suddenly another
green rounded the turn an energy rifle in
his hands aram straightened for the
	planet

expected attack but the green stopped
abruptly his head vanishing into a red
smear as another crashing roar echoed
down the corridor as he sank to the floor
aram turned to see kant mikal lowering
the first greens still smoking pistol

  lets keep going mikal muttered
breathlessly

  stopping only to pick up the fallen
greens rifle aram kant mikal and deve
ran on toward the pit -

  will the others try to make the space-
port  gasped jerrold as they ran

  theres nowhere else to go returned
mikal simply

the greens had not completely oc-
cupied the tunnels for they met no
more opposition the sounds of fighting had
stopped though as they burst into the
large chamber that housed the spacecraft
and aram realized that the greens were
gathering their forces for an attempt to
prevent the groups escape in the vessels
aram looked about him with a sick heart
of the original forty-five that had been
in the tunnels before the attack only ten
besides himself and deve had reached the
pit the others they told him had been
killed or captured by the greens and one
of them must have been forced to tell of
the spaceships and the plan of escape
through the locks

  the steelite doors of the pit were
closed and the remnants of the group
straggled aboard the star cluster kant
mikal took immediate command of the
ship and made ready for the perilous
passage through the locks to the sea
above he laid a hand on arams shoulder
and spoke with feeling this isnt the way
i planned it jerrold but we must do the
best we can good luck

  aram helped rig the star cluster for
flight and then stepped down onto the floor
of the pit he realized only too well as he
stood with deve alone on the floor of the
vast chamber that they would have to
wait until the heavy star cluster had
cleared the locks before they could blast
free of the cavern in the serpent

  he helped deve through the valve of the
small scout ship and hoisted himself up
crouching in the open lock with the dead

stories

greens energy rifle ready to pick off the
first green to come through the door the
greens had brought their disintegrators
into play and within minutes the door
would reach its limit of endurance the
steelite panels already glowed red   

  the star cluster lifted from its cradle
with a hissing roar that set the smaller
serpent to trembling the first lock opened
above it and it was gone into the black
maw of the vertical shaft its tail-flare
vanishing in the stygian darkness the
lock did not close and aram jerrold
breathed a silent message of thanks to
kant mikal who had left it open to ease
the serpents escape

  how long will it take them to clear
the remaining locks jerrold asked deve
anxiously

  deve divined his thoughts and shook her
head more time than it will take the
greens to cut through that door 

  aram was struck with an idea the
shield deve the energy shield

  for a moment hope lighted her face
but it quickly faded there is a time-lag
when the shield is deactivated aram
she said if we use it now we wont be
able to operate the locks in time they are
radio-controlled from inside the ship and
the shield stops all radiation    both
ways

  then well ram the locks

  will the ship stand it

  i dont know deve but its our only
chance if we can confuse them just long
enough to get under way we may make
it show me how the shield is energized
deve shrugged and sat down before the
control panel her fingers flashed lightly
over the banks of switches a low whining
of generators started deep in the vitals of
the small starship aram watching the
process glanced through the ports at the
melting steelite door of the cavern and he
was amazed to see the scene fade before
his eyes into a murky grayness

  they cant see us now deve jennet
said with a slow smile and we cant see
them

  lets go breathed aram

he hurriedly began rigging the
serpent for flight warming the jets
the last two alive



energizing the pumps and aerators he
gave silent thanks for the rigid training
of the thirty suns navy for his hands
automatically and swiftly found the proper
instruments and controls gyros began
their ascending crescendo whining in stri-
dent unison with the shield generators to
shape a harmonic pattern that pulsed in
the eardrums and set the teeth on edge
accumulators filled slowly relays clicked
shut as the serpent poised itself for flight

    a harsh thumping sound made aram
jerrold pause he cursed bitterly and re-
sumed his work the greens of course
were not fools they could not see the
serpent nor presumably had they ever
encountered an invisible craft before but
having melted down the steelite portal at
last and flooded into the vast pit they
could hear the serpents myriad warnings
of impending takeoff and they must have
begun raking the pit with projectile fire
some of the shots were finding the invi-
sible serpent and aram knew that the
destroyers light armor could not long
withstand a shelling

  deve has mikal had time to get the
star cluster clear of the locks now
jerrold shouted at the girl over the whine
of machinery

  deve jennet had heard the projectiles
too she nodded her head and braced her-
self against the navigation table lets
go she shouted back

  with pounding heart aram jerrold
lifted the serpent off the floor of the pit
blindly he let the invisible starship nose
into the open shaft above he knew that
the moment the greens realized their
quarry was gone they would begin firing
blindly up into the vertical tunnel above
them if one shot should hit the jets   
aram shuddered the destroyer would
come hurtling down out of the shaft to
smashing destruction on the floor of the
pit he held his breath and eased the
power forward the serpent responded
eagerly leaping up the mile-long tun-
nel   

  ahead lay the second set of locks and
then the shallows of the sea the small
starship careened upward scraping its
flanks on the smooth metal of the shaft
aram sat frozen before the controls a

thousand questions burned in his mind
and there were no sure answers for any
of them

  he couldnt be sure that mikal had
gotten the star cluster free he might at
this moment be driving the serpent into
the atomic tail-flare of the larger ship he
did not know whether or not the small
destroyer could withstand the impact of the
locks  or the sea itself still he drove
the ship upward and outward the auto-
matics set to continue the same suicidal
course should his own human hands falter
or fail

  he shouted for deve to strap herself
to the deck rings near the navigation table
and make ready for the impact time
seemed to slow down to a crawling pace
the breath came harshly in his throat and
sweat coursed down his naked back his
bare feet and legs felt cold and clammy

  he was not ready when it came the
first rending screech of tearing metal filled
the tiny control room and the instrument
panel came smashing up to meet him he
heard a whooshitig roar and the scream
of protesting gyros he heard deve cry
out as her bindings ripped loose and then
blackness seemed to splash up out of the
control panel and engulf him   

jerrold woke his head was
pounding painfully and his lips felt
mashed and bruised the strap that had
held him to the pilots seat had broken
and he lay across the instrument panel in
a welter of glass shards from shattered
dials the instruments were smeared with
blood    his blood aram realized
numbly he put a hand to his face and
it came away sticky and red

  the atomics throbbed and the dials told
him that the serpent was still under way
the high pitched hissing of escaping air
attested to the damage but it also told him
that the ship was in space    and clear
of atmion iv

   jerrold got dizzily to his feet and looked
about for deve she lay crumpled in a cor-
ner under a chart-locker bruised and
scratched by the impact of the crash she
moaned slightly as aram picked her up
and carried her to the pilots chair


planet

stories

  red alarm lights glared at him from
several points on the panel showing that
five forward compartments had been
crumpled and ruptured by the ramming of
the locks the pressure in the ship was low
enough to add to his discomfort method-
ically fighting off the dizziness aram
sealed off the leaky compartments and
started the aerators to build up the pres-
sure the greyness beyond the parts indi-
cated that the energy shield was still oper-
ating the serpent was traveling in slow
first-stage flight toward kaidor four and
one half light years distant

  aram

  jerrold turned to see that deve had
opened her eyes and was staring at him
horrified he tried to grin reassuringly at
her but his bruised lips succeeded only
in grimacing grotesquely through the
bloody smear of his face

   deve got to her feet found the surgical
kit that all fleet vessels carried and set
to work mending the damage aram was
glad to find that aside from his battered
lips he had only a long scalp cut along
his hair-line where the instrument panel
had tried to decapitate him the kit con-
tained balms and soothing anaesthetics and
presently both deve and jerrold were
patched and cleansed of blood and dirt

   there were coveralls in the lockers and
spaceboots and a hot drink from the robot
galley added to their rising spirits they
had escaped a force of the best the thirty
suns government could throw against
them and they were free of atmion iv
their ship was damaged but serviceable
   and they were together

  deve cut the energy shield and aram
took star-shots to reckon their position if
the greens had chased them in spacecraft
their long flight under the shield had cer-
tainly lost the pursuit for the space behind
them toward atmion iv was clear the
three stars of the system blazed below
them and aram pointed the ship at the
spot where the yellow kaidor sun lay just
under the range of visibility shifting into
second-stage flight the three suns of at-
mion streaked into a polychromatic blur
and the serpent plunged through the inter-
stellar night toward the thirtieth decant
and the unknown

it was a star-system of ten
planets aram jerrold could see clearly
that as was generally the case one of
them was a ringed giant under planetary
first-stage drive he brought the small star-
ship down into the systems ecliptic plane
at a distance of one light day as the ser-
pent passed the outermost planet the en-
ergy shield was reactivated

  during the days of the trip from the
twenty ninth decant and the atmion
suns no word had come from kant mikal
and his party aboard the star cluster
both jerrold and deve jennet had pon-
dered the advisibility of trying to establish
contact with the larger ship but finally
they decided to maintain radio silence
aram felt it inadvisable to risk detection
of the serpent so close to santanes strong-
hold

  instead they resolved to stick to the
original plan as outlined by kant mikal
back on atmion iv-landing on the third
planet of the kaidor sun and there await-
ing word from the star cluster mean-
while aram could attempt to repair the
damage caused the serpent by the ram-
ming of the locks

  on a dead-reckoning course jerrold
guided the small spaceship sunward the
peaceful pleasure of the days in space
was forgotten now forced out of his
mind by the nearness of kaidor v and its
hellish spawn of destruction thinking of
the poor creature he had seen in the tun-
nels back on atmion iv aram was taken
with a sick chill here under the alien
light of kaidor sun the virus that had
degenerated what had once been a man lay
quiescent in the sleek shells of uncounted
interstellar missiles ready to leap out and
away and carry its mind-destroying pow-
er to all the inhabited worlds of the thirty
suns jerrold knew that the use of such
a weapon would mean disaster if war
came it would be a war of stellar giants
smashing planets and minds alike in a
hideous carnival of death and savagery
the spawn of the kaidor sun meant
ruin   

  as yet aram reflected with faint hope
there had been no break provincial gov-
ernor santane was still as far as anyone
outside the thirtieth decant knew a loyal
the last two alive



civil servant of the thirty suns bureauc-
racy the special intelligence reports that
clicked methodically through the serpents
subspace communicator gave no hint of
rebellion against the banner of the space-
ship and sun in the kaidor system it was
possible too thought jerrold that the
group under kant mikal could convince
santane of the folly of open defiance
but even as the thoughts formed in his
mind doubt grew kant mikal had said
that santane had already stopped weapons
shipments to the rest of the thirty suns
he had no such authority it would take
some time for an investigation to be activ-
ated through the ponderous bureaucratic
procedures of the tetrarchy but investiga-
tion there would definitely be    and
santane could have nothing in his mind
but war with the thirty suns government
to have taken such a risk kaidor prov-
ince was the scientific arsenal of the tet-
rarchy and as such strategically valuable
beyond its intrinsic worth it would not
be too difficult aram realized to imagine
that the man who ruled kaidor could rule
the tetrarchy only it wasnt so no one
system could muster enough power to
crush the thirty suns without being
smashed to rubble itself in the process a
man who had served in a galactic fleet
could understand that but a man who
had served only as a governor could not
and that was the danger   

  as a naval officer aram jerrold knew
something that santane did not he knew
that vast navies will fight and destroy long
after the hope of victory has gone

  if war came there would be no victory
there would be only galactic disaster

with the energy shield
off and under reduced power the
serpent came down into the atmosphere of
kaidor iii the planets satellite lay like
a crescent of silver in the dark blue
star-flecked sky of the stratosphere

  beneath them the vast curving surface
of the planet flattened as the starship
sank lower the mottled blues and greens
and browns taking shape of oceans islands
and continents the sky grew lighter-a
pale blue-as the serpent crossed the twi-
light line and slanted down toward the

surface of the turbulent sea

  scud clouds raced across the sky and
light rain pattered against the ports of the
slowly moving spaceship quite suddenly
the squall passed and the serpent hung
above a sea of brilliant blues and greens
frothed with white-caps

  deve watched through the ports enrap-
tured look aram look at the colors
in that sea

  side by side they watched the play of
colors in the ocean fascinated by the
swirling grace and chromatic wonder of
the waves

  in the far distance lay the low silhouette
of land jerrold let the serpent move to-
ward it keel skimming the dancing white
crowns of the sea

  there were a few graceful sea-birds
with leathery wings and brightly plumed
breasts and there was life in the sea deve
and jerrold could see schools of lithe
shapes flashing silver beneath the water
but the land itself was silent the white
sand of a curving beach came up out of the
distance to meet them beyond lay green
rolling hills and wooded slopes bright with
flowers and farther into the glare of the
morning sun great snow-capped mountains
reared their jagged spines against the
blue in the sky

  aram    its beautiful the girl
breathed its the world we dreamed of
finding  

  jerrold remembered the nights they had
shared back on mighty terminus he
recalled their idle dreams of a world be-
yond the farthest stars where they could
be free this he felt was such a world

  deve turned around suddenly to face
him there was longing in her eyes-a
look of wistfulness that filled him with
tenderness

  we  we must never forget this
world aram she said perhaps one day
we can come here    she let her voice
sink low oh aram if we could only
stay here if we could just forget every-
thing but this lovely peaceful world

  aram jerrold thought of santane and
the threatening clouds of war he thought
of the mighty senseless civilization of the
thirty suns-oblivious to the dangers
that threatened to engulf it quite suddenly

stories

he hated it all hated it more than he had
ever despised it when it had tortured and
persecuted him he felt trapped by his
unasked-for responsibilities to the culture
that had condemned him but trapped
he was and he knew it even hating it
he could not let a galactic civilization van-
ish without trace and refuse to lift a hand
to save it    to save something from the
wreckage

  kant mikals words came back to him
pressing insistent demanding

  he took deve in his arms id want
nothing more than to stay here    with
you he said gently but wed never be
safe if santane ruled the tetrarchy hed
never leave a paradise like this alone   
i know that said deve sighing
but maybe someday    she broke off
im so tired aram

  jerrold thought of how long this girl
had been fighting-in secret in constant
danger of her life-against the menace
of an interregnum of savagery in the gal-
axy it made him want to kill santane
with his bare hands and smash the tet-
rarchy into cosmic rubble

  but it was no good a responsibility had
fallen onto deves shoulders and his kant
mikal had said it and no matter how they
might wish that two others had been cho-
sen out of all the teeming billions of the
thirty suns both he and deve knew that
they must throw themselves between the
galactic millstones and try with their last
breath to avert the limbo that yawned to
swallow the first stellar civilization that
the race had laboriously built it was not
perfect--but it was their own

for two days and two nights deve
and aram waited by the restless sea
of kaidor iii they wandered over the
green hills and through the wooded glades
hand in hand caught up in the wonder
and beauty of the silent planet

  aram was able to patch some of the
breaks in the serpents hull and together
he and deve planned what moves they
must make next each time they left the
ship the recorders were set so that any
possible word from the star ouster would
be caught but only the endless stream
of reports and routine messages of the

thirty suns naval intelligence bureau
marred the wire of the recording device
when they sought the shelter of the ship
again

  together they swam in the warm sea
and rested in the sunlight on the white
beach listening to the restless sound of
the ocean it was an idyll of happiness
made more poignant by the pressing near-
ness of danger coming ever closer

  it was on the evening of the third day
on kaidor iii that the subspace radio
shattered their faint hopes for the success
of the star ousters mission the infor-
mation came not from the group and
kant mikal but viciously shockingly from
the announcer in the naval intelligence
sending station back on terminus it came
smashing the peaceful stillness of the
evening calm

 attention attention  all
fleet units of the twenty
eighth twenty ninth and
thirtieth decant squad-
rons rendezvous check
point  kaidor province
according to plan - direc-
tive -a- task force com-
mander will neutralize
planet kaidor five for the
safety of the tetrarchy

  deves face was pale santane has
done it at last

  it had come then thought aram heav-
ily the cosmic wheels were beginning
to turn a provincial governor rebelled
and across light-years of space forces of
mind-defying magnitude began to gather
thousands of mighty battleships millions
of men planet-smashing weapons far
away on terminus government bureaus
shifted ponderously from peaceful admin-
istration to war clerks and department
heads councilmen and executives-all
shifting their attentions from peacetime
routines to wartime expedients and with-
in hours those wartime expedients would
become routine fixed immutable rou-
tines impossible to change without painful
time-consuming effort

  jerrold spun the radio dials searching
for the government station on kaidor v
he needed information he needed to
know what santane was telling his popu-
the last two alive



lation

      the thirty suns merchant vessel
star cluster has fallen into our hands
the passengers and crew sabotage agents
of the tetrarchy have been imprisoned
and will be executed  

  the voice of the kaidor announcer
echoed menacingly through the still con-
trol room of the serpent

  aram theyve got kant mikal and
the others cried deve

  sabotage agents aram spat

   it is expected that the worker
population will conduct itself with cour-
age and resourcefulness under the threa-
tened attack continued the announcer
smoothly our newly organized armed
forces are even now taking measures
against the tyrants home worlds   

  aram shuddered thinking about the
measures santane had devised for use
against the tetrarchy the brutalizing
virus   

    it is not to be expected that the
war will be of long duration our scien-
tists have developed a weapon that will
make active resistance on the part of the
tyrants impossible they will not dare
to attack us  

  confirmation thought aram bleakly of
santanes dream of winning power by
threats a savage terrible blunder

  generalissimo santane has struck the
shackles of the tetrarchy from the people
of kaidor work and fight for victory
the announcement was followed by the
playing of martial music

  jerrold snapped the radio off with a
curse kant mikal a prisoner-very likely
dead already the fleet converging on
kaidor santane drunk with power
brandishing his awful weapon over the
heads of the mute billions of the thirty
suns

  what now aram  asked deve
quietly

  we must go to kaidor v    now
he replied

  in space again aram tried to shake
off his forebodings and failed miserably
they were speeding into a tempest of
stellar magnitude and they were but two
-a man and a woman-against a war-
mad galaxy

  the tiny serpent pointed for the fifth
planet of the kaidor sun and drew its
mantle of invisibility around itself as
though to hide from the fiery stars

far beneath the starship

kaidor v lay like a bright scimitar
with the energy shield momentarily off
they approached the planets night side
deep in the global penumbra no lights
marked the populous factory cities-the
world rested dark poised to lash out
against the stars falsely confident in its
possession of frightful weapons

  carefully jerrold lowered the serpent
toward the spot he had marked on the
planetary chart-a deep valley near san-
tanes capital city of astrel once course
and rate of descent were computed he
reactivated the energy shield and groped
his way downward through the sullen
night of kaidor v

  after what seemed an eternity of wait-
ing deve and jerrold felt their ships
keel touch the ground aram stood by
the jets alert for the sudden tipping that
would warn them that the serpent had
landed on a steep slope or crag the deck
assumed a slight angle-no more aram
cut the power and listened to the des-
cending whine of the gyroscopes as they
coasted to a halt then there was silence
only the faint hum of the energy shield
broke the stillness

  jerrold and deve studied the chart of
kaidor v carefully aram had no desire
to have the serpent meet with the same
fate as the ill-starred star cluster con-
cealment and secrecy were paramount

  on the gridded chart of the planet the
dark city of astrel lay like a blot of
ink there is a conveyor running near
here deve aram said it must carry
ores from the mines here- he pointed
out the shafts on the map-to the found-
ries in the city they wont be able to
guard the conveyor all along its length
we can get into astrel that way i think
and what then asked the girl
jerrold shrugged im a space officer
-not a spy i know that we must try
to reach santane and help mikal and the
others if we can-

  we had some agents still in the city


planet stories

said deve thoughtfully perhaps they
havent been discovered we can try and
reach them    they might be able to
help us

  it will be risky deve now that the
fight is in the open

  i dont see how we can possibly reach
santane alone she said

  deve was right of course aram real-
ized without help they would never be
able to penetrate the barriers of security
the provincial governor must have
erected between himself and the population
of his planet

  cutting the shield aram searched the
dark landscape beyond the ports the
night was black and still the stars made
an unfamiliar pattern across the sky a
thin band of nebulosity showed the edge
of the galactic lens in a peculiarly dis-
torted perspective here in the heart of
the thirtieth decant they were far from
the populous worlds of the galaxys cen-
ter-farther even than they had been in
atmion province but this barren cold
world would be for the next few hours
the center of the thirty suns here on
the metallic soil of kaidor v the fate
of an interstellar civilization would be
decided   

  there were many deadly weapons ini
the lockers but jerrold decided to take
only two plastic energy pistols such
weapons would be less likely to be found
by the weapons alarms that were stan-
dard street fixtures on all the planets
of the thirty suns

  with a sigh the valve slid open and
aram and the girl dropped to the frozen
volcanic soil the air smelled bitter and
the cold was intense kaidor v was more
than twenty-four light-minutes from its
primary and warmth was slight it had
been chosen for the center of kaidor pro-
vince rather than a more hospitable world
because of the richness of its radioactive
ores and immense nitrogen yielding de-
posits

the starship had landed in a
small ravine and there aram de-
cided it could stay relatively safe from
discovery aram marked the spot on his
chart and etched it into his brain it was

hard to leave the tiny serpent it rep-
resented all the security they could ex-
pect on this unfriendly world

  they climbed to the crest of the ridge
and dropped down onto a flat plateau
striking out across it toward the spot
where jerrold estimated they would in-
tercept the line of the conveyor

  they walked along in silence tinder a
canopy of oddly unfriendly stars pre-
sently the faint sound of machinery
warned that the conveyor was near in
the darkness they almost ran headlong
into it the light of deves small pocket
torch revealed two belts one bounced
along empty speeding back toward the
mines in the hills the other groaned
under a heavy loading of metallic ores
bound for the smelters and steel con-
verters of astrel

  its moving fast but well have to
jump it anyway aram said softly

  dont worry about me replied deve
stoutly just give me a hand

  aram grinned in spite of himself
deves courage and resolution were a
boon on this quixotic mission

  he picked her up and began to run
along the uneven soil parallel to the
racing conveyor with an effort he heaved
her up on to the pile of ore he heard
her give a little cry of pain as she landed
among the sharp shards and then she
was gone into the blackness without
pause he leaped onto the belt himself
skinning his hands and legs oil the rocky
cargo

for a moment he stopped to catch
his breath and then began to crawl
forward toward deve jennet it took
him a long while to reach her and when
he did they found that she had dropped
her gun in the scramble to board the
conveyor

  the thought of facing a hostile city
with one small pistol did not please but
aram realized that under no circum-
stances could he have hoped to out-gun
the combined forces of the thirtieth de-
cant so the loss of a gun really made
little difference the whole of the ser-
pents armory would do them no good
if concealment failed
the last two alive



  well have to get clear of this thing
before it reaches its destination deve
jerrold shouted above the roar of the
belt

  i only hope the marshalling yards
and ore stockpiles arent too well guarded
deve replied-and aram silently echoed
her hope

   in the near distance coming ever nearer
were the periodic flares of the great steel
converters of astrel the city itself
seemed blacked-out but apparently san-
tane-the generalissimo thought jer-
rold wryly-was keeping his workers busy
on weapons production right up until the
last moment of danger    another proof
to arams mind that santane did not
believe the tetrarchy would dare to ac-
tually attack he must already have
warned the thirty suns government per-
haps sending specimens of his handiwork
to impress the supreme council of the
power of his virus weapons yet the
fleet would attack-jerrold felt sure of
it the very nature of the thirty suns
government made any other course un-
thinkable bureaucracies aram knew re-
acted like headless beasts to the things
that threatened them unable to make fine
distinctions or true evaluations defiance
brought reprisal it was as simple as
that

  it was difficult to see anything in the
darkness and jerrold began to fear that
they might be catapulted into the fur-
naces themselves the flares in the sky
seemed very close now

  a tiny blue light flashed by that aram
thought must mark the entrance to the
stockpiling yards he scrambled to his
feet and pulled deve up beside him

  get ready to jump clear he shouted
in her ear

  wind snatched at his words and the
swaying conveyor made standing difficult
-almost impossible deve clutched at him
trying to keep her balance and then
without warning the belt slammed
abruptly into a flat right-angle turn pitch-
ing them off into darkness filled with
hurtling chunks of ore

  aram clung to the girl as they spilled
off the belt and banged hard into a great
pile of ore more of the stuff continued

to flood down on them from the con-
veyor above burying them under an op-
pressive weight desperately jerrold
clawed his way out into the open and
still clinging to deve rolled precipitously
down the steep slope of the stockpile
they struck the bottom with bone-jar ring
force and lay there gasping

  a brilliant beam of light sliced through
the dusty darkness pinning them to the
ore pile motes danced wildly in the gleam-
ing cone and in one awful flash of in-
sight aram knew what had happened 
understood the meaning of that tiny blue
light he had seen a dark-light scanner

  floodlights came on and the intruders
found themselves blinking into a semi-
circle of energy-rifle muzzles in the hands
of grim-faced black-clad guards

  aram jerrold felt his heart sink they
were captured   

between two files of guards deve
and jerrold walked into the city
they had hoped to strip of its weapons
the bitterness of their failure rode hard
on jerrolds shoulders he kept hearing
again and again the phrase that kant
mikal had used to save something
from the wreckage    it seemed im-
possible now the giants and the furies
were gathering the might of the thirty
suns would descend like a rain of fire
on kaidor v and the mindless death
nurtured here would sweep the inhabited
worlds like a plague the forces jerrold
had hoped to chain were free now and
threatening like some ghastly cosmic
storm the teeming cities would crumble
the spaceways would be deserted night
would fall on mans imperfect but highest
achievement and he would return to the
primeval muck

  aram searched the faces of the streams
of workers they passed they were sul-
len whipped men from the tyranny of
the tetrarchy they had slipped into the
clutches of santane for them there was
no hope no dignity and only the release
of death could change their lot

  the black guards herded deve and
jerrold onto a small air-sled and the tiny
craft nosed upward and into the streams
of aerial traffic above the darkened city


planet

stories

ahead lay the black bulk of a towering
skylori this aram realized must be san-
tanes citadel

  the air-sled was sinking slowly to a
landing on one of the many landing plat-
forms that marred the flanks of the
mighty skylon when the first alarm sirens
began to wail aram turned his eyes to the
night sky automatically he could not hope
to see the fleet for they must still be beyond
the orbit of kaidor x but he did see
the red streaks of the first interceptor
rockets taking off the sky in the east
was greying the attack would come by
day

  the air-sled touched the landing stage
and the guards hurried jerrold and deve
jennet into the citadel through a maze
of halls thronging with white-faced offi-
cers in new and unfamiliar uniforms they
went past guards and armored doorways
at last they stood in a vaulted oblong
room that hummed with activity

  it was a combat center in the center
of the room lay a huge three-dimensional
chart of the thirtieth decant and the
kaidor system jerrold recognized the
red blips that indicated the approaching
fleet fully ten thousand strong    and
he recognized something else too he had
felt this kind of tension in ships of the
navy it was fear-universal jittery fear
these people aram knew suddenly were
terribly desperately afraid of that advanc-
ing armada their leader had told them
that it would not dare attack yet it came
on inexorably and they were afraid

  yellow streaks in the chart showed
the track of interceptors already fanning
out from kaidor v seeking targets in
the huge onrushing formation of mighty
battleships that spread across light-min-
utes of space the tiny weapons had al-
ready taken a small toll of the slower
fleet vessels but the rest continued sun-
ward their losses unfelt

  this was what aram feared santane
would not or could not realize    that
no matter how dreadful his vints weapon
forces of such magnitude could not be
halted by threats once they were put in
motion

  now santanes secretly built fleet was
blasting into space jerrold estimated that

it consisted of perhaps five hundred large
starships-torpedo launchers mainly built
for defense

  near kaidor vii the ringed giant the
two fleets made first contact the battle
of the thirtieth decant had begun

  the guards shoved at jerrold and he
was led away from the chart and its fas-
cinating picture of battle he and deve
were taken up a spiralling staircase to
the balcony that overlooked the combat
center and through a heavily guarded
door

  the chamber in which they now found
themselves was strangely quiet after the
fear-tinged confusion of the combat cen-
ter all but one of their guards with-
drew and aram faced a tall powerfully
built man who stood engrossed in a bank
of scanner-views of the battle

  presently the man looked up to scowl
at his prisoners aram jerrold knew at
once that it was-at last-santane

aram studied the man with

interest here was the man whose
rebellion had catapulted the galaxy into
war because of santane billions faced
degradation or extinction it seemed im-
possible that one man could cause such
a cataclysmic upheaval in a star-spanning
culture but there was more to it than
that of course santane-as a man-was
simply one more bit of protoplasm in the
vast mystery of the cosmos but santane
-as a symbol-was real and important
he was a living monument to the im-
mutable face that tyranny begets more
tyranny and that the very existence of
absolute power results in the two awful
corollaries    ambition and strife

  the tetrarchy had spawned santane
just as surely as night follows day san-
tane was the cancer in the body of the
despotism of the thirty suns that was
destined to destroy it    and thought
aram grimly himself with it

  aram jerrold studied the craggy face
and the deep-set glowing eyes as san-
tane stood there before the simulacrum
of armageddon in the scanners and knew
there was madness in the man

  santane spoke and the sound rasped
across the senses
the last two almvet



  you are aram jerrold and deve jen-
net-agents of the tetrarchy spies   
high ranking spies his icy gaze searched
the faces of the man and woman before
him do you deny it

  we are who you say replied jer-
rold evenly but we are not spies the
tetrarchy has undoubtedly set a price on
our heads by now

  you lie the tetrarchy sent you here
because they are afraid of me santane
laughed scornfully they have seen what

i	can do

  dont be a fool santane jerrold
said softly the tetrarchy is not afraid
of you it cant be it hasnt the ability
to fear you or anything else cant you
see that he indicated the scanners the
fleet was bearing ever closer to kaidor

v	slashing through the cordons of de-
fensive craft doggedly impervious to
losses and dying ships and men

  fear touched santanes face    but
for just an instant aram knew with
sinking heart that the mans madness
would not let him believe the truth

  no said santane tensely they are
afraid of me-or you wouldnt have been
sent here

  aram was struck with a sudden gro-
tesque pity for the man all the weeks
he had spent in danger and in preparation
for this mission that had failed he had
thought of santane as the living incarna-
tion of crafty evil what he saw before
him now was a insane man-frightened
by the mighty forces he had unleashed
and could not now turn or control in
that moment aram felt that kant mikals
injunction to save something from the
ruins was truly impossible for nothing
could come right when a single madman
could smash in days the work of millennia

  santanes face was again rigid and cold
perhaps you have not seen what my bio-
logical weapons can do    guard bring
in the others

  aram felt an icy hand closing about
his heart the others   

  kant mikal    the men and womenof
the star cluster   

  santane    you havent    jer-
rold broke off in horror as the guard re-
-planet stories-november

turned leading a line of five shambling
beasts the creatures fought the chains
that bound them howling with outrage

  how demanded santane can ter-
minus attack me if they face that his
eyes lit kindled with some obscene plea-
sure at the spectacle first there are
pains in the neck and head blinding-
agonizing pains then comes uncon-
sciousness and memory goes    then
the glands alter and men beome   
beasts  

  deve jennet moaned her friends and
comrades were in that line of disfigured
subhuman things she clutched at aram
for support

  jerrold felt red fury explode within
him he wanted to feel his bare hands
on santanes throat    his teeth in his
flesh with an oath he launched himself
bodily at the smiling madman hands grop-
ing for the throat under the twisted grin
he saw santane back away in sudden
fright and the black flash of the guard
interposing himself between them the
guard raised his rifle and brought the
muzzle down in a chopping arc aram
felt a searing pain above his eyes and
pitched into  a reddish blur of oblivion 

jerrold awoke in a small glassed-
in chamber his head ached dully
and he could feel the stiffness of dried
blood on his brow he rolled over and
staggered to his feet realizing that he
must be at the very pinnacle of the mighty
skylon that housed santanes headquar-
ters

  the same black guard who had struck
him down stood impassive in the comer
and aram could see santane standing
with deve on a small landing stage beyond
the glass he saw something else too
and his breath came faster there was
a small air-sled on the landing stage
bright with new paint and santanes own
insigne of the trident and flame

  there was a subspace radio installation
in the corner of the aerie and aram
jerrold knew instantly that he had been
brought up to the skylons top to es-
tablish contact with the invading fleet
to warn the forces of the thirty suns
to surrender


planet stories

  santane returned with deve held at
his side the sight of the mans hand
possessively on deves wrist brought a
return of arams fury

  you see santane said with a thin
smile the fleet does fear me they have
broken off their attack fnd are circling
beyond the stratosphere

  that meant aram knew that the ships
of the thirty suns were preparing for
bombardment of kaidor v knowing- the
richness of the nitrogen-bearing surface
soil of the planet the task force com-
mander would undoubtedly be readying
his vessels to rain down nitrogen fission
bombs trying to exceed critical mass in
the air and ground of the planet and
setting off chain reactions to rip it apart
by the expenditure of the energy con-
tained in the globe itself santane not
being a space officer could not know that

  kant mikals wish to have something
saved from the wreckage now could be
accomplished in only two ways-both im-
possible to arams mind

  he and deve could escape and save
themselves  or he could prevent san-
tane from launching his interstellar mis-
siles when the bombs began to fall

  call the fleet commander santane
ordered brusquely tell him he must land
and place himself ait my orders

  such a call would be ignored aram
knew that   

  hurry santane demanded pettishly

  still aram could bring himself to no
decision

  santane turned took a stoppered vial
from a cabinet and faced aram again
with a scowl one drop of this on the
skin and a human being becomes   
what you saw below shall i use it on the
woman to convince you where your duty
lies

  aram felt his heart skip a beat santane
was not bluffing pressed he would carry
out his threat from sheer perverted mal-
ice aram looked hungrily toward the
small air-sled on the landing   

  he took a step toward the radio very
probably his voice recognized would
bririgs the bombs even quicker-but there
was no way to convince santane of that
he was beyond reason

  a high pitched sound broke the still-
ness aram pitched instinctively to the
floor as a bomb struck the ground far
below and near the base of the skylon
the whole structure shook with the force
of the concussion the glass of the aerie
fogging into a maze of tiny cracks frag-
ments of the ceiling came powdering
down santane staggered against the wall
the vial still in his hand a look of ter-
rified disbelief on his face

  no he gasped they wouldnt
dare  

  aram tried to reach deves side but
santane was quicker

  tell them to call off the attack he
screamed or i infect the woman
quickly quickly

aram spun on his knee and dived
for santane the vial flew across the
room and shattered against the wall jer-
rold smashed his fist into santanes dis-
torted face-he felt the splintering of
teeth in the shattered mouth a sizzling
beam of fire flashed past arams eyes
he straightened and struck santane again
sending the man staggering across the
room

  instead of attacking or trying to es-
cape santane leaped for a wall commun-
icator his battered face was a mask of
maniacal rage jerrold caught him but
   too late to prevent four words from
screeching into the microphone   

  fire the virus missiles

  aram sobbed with frustrated rage and
swung his clenched fists again and again
into santanes moody face he rolled
on the littered floor trying to strangle
the life from the wildly struggling mad-
man who had spawned disaster

  another bomb fell rocking the skylon
beams clattered down from the towering
superstructure caving in sections of the
aeries roof the guard who had been
circling for a safe shot at aram shrieked
in agony as a metal section took him
across the shoulders and snapped his back
like a twig

  suddenly aram felt a wetness on his
clothes and a bitterness on his tongue
the two wrestling men had rolled into
the last two alivei



the pool of liquid from the broken vial

  sanctane screamed with terror and in
a frantic burst of energy broke away
and stumbled out onto the landing stage
and the air-sled

deve rushed to aram helping him to
his feet as she touched him he recoiled

  dont deve dont touch me

  but the girls hands too were wet
with the sticky stuff of the vial and aram
knew with a sick certainty that they
were both infected with the virus of bes-
tiality

  after him hopeless now sick with
despair aram wanted only to kill san-
tane

  but santane had not launched the air-
sled instead he knelt on its deck a medi-
cal kit in his hands he was trying with
trembling fingers to fill a syringe from
a narrow capsule jerrold knocked the
instrument from his hands and dragged
him from the machine the madman
fought back with desperate strength but
aram smashed him again and again
against the stones of the landing in a
last spasmodic effort santane caught
aram by the throat and forced him toward
the edge far below the glowing radio-
active smoke of death roiled against the
sides of the weakened skylon aram
could see flames eating ravenously at the
lower levels santane shrieked with tri-
umph as aram hung momentarily over
the abyss aram twisted   

  and then santane was gone vanishing
in a long wailing fall twisting and turn-
ing like a rag-doll until his scream of
terror blended with the cry of another
falling bomb

without pausing to catch his
breath jerrold returned to the air-
sled and picked up the syringe it was
only partly full and the capsule that san-
tane had used to load it had been smashed
it was the antidote  it had to be the
antidote

  deve here with shaking hands he
caught her arm and sank the needle into
her flesh squeezing the plunger down
as the fluid in the cylinder reached the
half-way point deve pulled away

  thats enough the rest is for you
she breathed

  no deve i dont know if its enough
for both of us santane was going to
take the full measure for himself and
he should know  

  deve jennet shook her head i dont
care she said i wouldnt want to go
on    without you

  aram pleaded but deve would not be
convinced she had no wish to survive
alone finally aram took the syringe
and emptied it into his forearm

  now well see he muttered

  the howl of bombs was a steady in-
creasing cacophony now and though
ships of santanes fleet still fought the
thirty suns naval force bombed almost
at will the skylon shook and buckled
under the bombardment and the radia-
tion count on the counters in the wrecked
aerie showed an increasingly dangerous
concentration still the virus missiles took
the air streaking the radioactive clouds
with their tail-flares and aram watched
with sick horror as the awful spawn of
the kaidor sun rose to spread bestiality
while he stood helplessly by

  aram deve spoke to him gently
amid the rising symphony of destruction
we have to get clear aram remember
what kant mikal said    and we are
all thats left now

  the fleet   

  the fleet will return to terminus
we cant stop them deve said with
finality

  aram knew it was true mindless to
the last the bureaucracy would stick to
its directives and general orders the
fleet would return  to oblivion

they mounted the air-sled and
slanted up into the tortured air of
the dying planet a huge starship with
the golden spaceship and sun blazon came
hurtling down out of the sky like a
fiery brand a smaller ship bearing san-
tanes trident and flame imbedded in
its flank the two ships dissolved into
a ball of greasy fire as they smashed into
the crowded buildings of shattered astrel

  more and more nitrogen fission bombs
were falling now as the air-sled streaked
	planet

across the flaming sky toward the ravine
that hid the serpent the very soil of
the planet seemed to dance in a hellish
carnival of destruction glancing back
aram saw the towering skylon come
plunging down in torrents of nibble and
human flesh he knew with finality that
he was witnessing the end of everything
he had known-the chaotic collapse of
a culture that had spawned its own neme-
sis man-diving from the pinnacle of
stellar dominion to the depths of nothing-
ness    because he had tolerated tyranny

  jerrold shook his head to clear away
the sudden pain that stabbed across his
temples one thought grew in his mind
with increasing clarity he and deve must
somehow survive perhaps other men and
women would come through the end in
remote worlds but there was no way of
being certain he had to be sure  he
had to know that the end would not
come for all the race he a man and
deve a woman could still carry out the
mercifully dead kant mikals injunction
in those fleeting moments above the
writhing doomed surface of kaidor v
survival became an obsession with aram
jerrold

  the serpent awaited them where they
had left it and they hurried through the
valve feeling the tremblors of the fifth
planets death agonies

  aram drove the ship upward seeking
the safety of space and their haven both
knew where they were going though
neither had put it into words

  at a distance of five diameters from
the globe of kaidor v aram paused to
see the death of a world

  like a savage animal the fleet con-
tinued to worrythe trembling planet with
a vicious hail of bombs the pair in the
serpent could see bright internal fires as
the crust of the world split under the
hideous attack like a stricken thing kai-
dor v seemed to totter on its axis great
chunks of rock were blown clear by the
pressure of expanding inner fires

  for hours the death agonies of the
planet continued until finally like a
bursting bubble the globe expanded huge
slashes appeared from pole to pole the
ice caps vanished into twin clouds of

stories

superheated steam fragments peeled off
as gravitational balances were disturbed
globules of molten lava fanned out like
strings of beads kaidor v trembled
with a cosmic delirium-great promin-
ences of atomic fire leaping far into
space and then quite suddenly it was
over with its heart ripped out by the
violent fission of its inner substance the
hollow shell collapsed into a swirling
nebulous cloud of cosmic rubble rapidly
spreading out into a belt of tiny plane-
toids spanning the place where once a
mighty world circled the parent star   

	 

  the serpent settled softly into a
wooded glade and grew still within
aram jerrold fought the wracking pains
in his head screaming aloud with the
agony of it deve lay unconscious on the
steel deck moaning softly

  aram knew that the antidote he had
injected into their veins was not enough
vaguely he recalled that once-long ago
it seemed-he had been told that a small
amount of specific would prevent physical
damage but the virus was claiming him
nonetheless the pounding agony in his
head was streaked with delirious phan-
tasms kant mikals words echoed through
his brain though he no longer recog-
nized them as other than his own his
screaming madness took the shape of those
words as he lifted deve in his arms and
staggered out of the ship

  driven by some deep seated racial
memory he stumbled toward the sea-
the mother-the giver of life the sheer
brutal agony of the virus increased with
every step blinding himwith its inten-
sity until at last he could bear it no
longer and sank to his knees on the white
sand of a beach and pitched forward
across the still form of the woman he
carried hands outstretched toward the
shallows of a restless sea that laved him
   laved him   

deve stood nude in the glory
of the morning sunlight and lifted
her arms to the sky in an ecstacy of free-
dom how lovely it is she murmured

  the figure at her feet stirred and she
touched him playfully with a bare foot
the last two alivei



  aram woke puzzled something deep
in the back of his mind troubled him
there had been something   

  come swim with me

  aram looked up at the naked girl be-
fore him she was deve he knew that
he tried to remember more but he could
not a strange shroud seemed to have
covered up everything    language he
-seemed to command but   

  he put the troublesome thoughts out
of his mind and stripped off the strange
coverings on his body hand in hand
with deve he waded into the sea they
swam and played in the warm sunlight
and presently tiring of their sport sought
the shade of a wooded glade

  as they walked hand in hand among
the flowering shrubs under the trees deve
stopped abruptly

  aram die said puzzled what is
jthat

  an alien shape stood among the ver-
dure gleaming where the sunlight pierced
the foliage it was a long cylinder tap-
ered at both ends and lined with round
blank ports they stood there staring at
the spaceship with perplexed incompre-
hension both had a vague feeling that
it was familiar

  what is it aram the girl asked
again

  i    dont know he confessed

  i think we did know    once deve
said softly aram why are we here
why the question touched off sparks
of memory that brightened and as quickly
faded aram spoke painfully dredging
the words from beyond the veil of forget-
fulness

  we    must    save    something
   from the ruins

  what ruins the girl asked impa-
tiently what is it we must save

  but memory had faded aram could
not answer her

  still she persisted with feminine cur-
lousity unsatisfied

  aram what is this place

  for a long moment he stood in silence
beside her in the sun-splashed glade he
listened to the gentle sound of the wind
in the trees and the restless murmur of
the sea presently he replied but with
a question are you happy here deve
oh yes she breathed

he took her in his arms the space-
ship and the past completely forgotten
then this is    paradise he said

dianetics a door to the future

by james bush

an increased life-span freedom from 
of all human illnesses and a major increase
 in intelligence-these are only a few of
the benefits promised us by a new science called
dianetics

  dianetics is both the name of a recent book
about how the human mind operates and the gen-
eral term used to cover specific methods of re-
pairing healing and perfecting the human mind

  just how does the human mind work up to a
few years ago nobody really knew

  why does the human mind fail to work effi-
ciently at times or all the time another mystery

  if the claims made for the new science of dia-
netics are borne out both those mysteries are now
solved some of these claims are so flabbergast-
ing as to stagger even the hardened science-fiction
fan for instance

  dianetics claims to have cured many types of
heart ailment arthritis the common cold stomach
ulcers sinus trouble asthma and many other dis-
eases amounting to about  of the whole cat-
alogue of human ills

  dianetics also claims to have cured virtually
every known form of mental disease these cures
have encompassed the severest form of insanity
workers in dianetics declare flatly

  furthermore-and in this claim among others
lies dianetics bid to be called a science-dianetics
claims to be able to cure all these aberrations and
diseases every time without fail at the time this
is being written some months before you will
read it dianetics has been tried on a minimum of
 people and its originators say has worked
 without failure in all these cases

  nor is this all fantastic though what ive al-
ready written may seem to be use of dianetic
therapy on so-called normal people seems to
produce changes in them which can only be de-
scribed as dynamite

  normal people treated by dianetic therapy
its said undergo a rise in intelligence efficiency
and well-being averaging a third above their pre-
vious capacity in one case a woman the iq-
intelligence quotient-rose  points before the
full course of therapy was run

  such clears as they are called are said to be
immune to any and all forms of mental disease
and to any and all forms of organic diseases
caused by mental or emotional difficulties

  it might be a good idea to stop here and ask
the names of the people who are making these in-
credible claims they are none of them profes-
sional quacks faith-healers bread-piil rollers or
other forms of swindlers they are all men with

solid reputations and all as it happens quite
familiar to the science-fiction reader

  the leader of the new school of thought is l
ron hubbard author of fear final black-
out and many other science-fiction classics by
trade hubbard is an engineer

  hubbards two principal confreres are john w
campbell jr and dr joseph e winter mr
campbell of course is widely known even to the
general public as a government consultant in
nuclear physics the author of the atomic
story and to us as the editor of a top-notch
science-fiction magazine dr winter who by the
way is an md not a phd has published some
science-fiction stories but until dianetics came
along he was best known as an expert endocrino-
logist of unimpeachable reputation

  hubbards book however does not include
any formal evidence for the claims the dianetics
institute in elizabeth n j is equally unwilling
to offer authenticated case records or any other
evidence of that specific kind the book dianetics
men point out offers the therapy procedures in
complete detail if you want case histories per-
form your own experiments

  as it happens one of the more spectacular cures
claimed by dianetics took place in the new york
area and could be checked from outside sources
jerome bixby editor of planet stories checked
it the claim was so hospital authorities who
have no connection with dianetics as a movement
vouch for it cautiously but definitely

  my own personal tests of the therapy-on my-
self my wife and a friend namely jerome
bixby-havent proceeded very far as yet but
as far as theyve gone they check with the claims
the phenomena hubbard describes in the book
do appear they appear in the order in which he
says they appear and they match his descriptions
of them to the letter such after-effects as weve
been able to observe also check

  if dianetics does work-and every check ive
been able to run thus far indicates that it does-
it may well be the most important discovery of
this or any other century it will bring the long-
sought rule of reason to the problems of local
and world politics communication law and ah
most every other field of human endeavor-the
goal of a  year search

house new york   hermitage by the
way is the publisher of a number of books on
psychology and psychoanalysis universally ac-
knowledged to be serious contributions to the field

t o include james blishs last-minute article
on dianetics weve had to cramp the vizi-
graph a bit this issue therefore in order to run
as many letters as possible some five hundred
words of your editors carefully considered prose
have just hit the wastebasket the several items
below however we stubbornly refuse to discard

  two books one recent and the other dated
 the shadow on the hearth
by judith merril and the key to the
great gate by hinko gottlieb recom-
mended miss merrils first novel stands as an
intimate and very immediate picture of what a-
war may mean not to our society as a whole or
to the brass but to and within the family group
it makes for thoughtful reading gottliebs book
on the other hand is a cheerful and fantastic
canvas in a more-or-less solid einsteinian frame
the publishers are respectively doubleday and
simon  schuster

  a mysterious system of our own reveals that
the favorite stories of the last issue were

tales of character

                     west  st

                    new york  n y

dear editor

  congratulations slightly belated on your ac-
cession to high office-and with all due credit to
your predecessors planet stories seems to be
improving under your guidance the new typog-
raphy on the contents page and at the individual

story headings is particularly good is it per-
manent or is this only a trial run permanent-
ed

  the stories are good too dont snort and
toss this away ill go into greater detail later
one of the most pleasant things about ps re-
mains its use of tales of character though the
plots are there and very nicely worked out be-
sides your readers arent afflicted with the mo-
notonously creaking mechanically inhuman pre-
cision of plots in other science-fiction magazines
where characterization is reduced to the ultimate
minimum and the cast of the stories can only be
distinguished from each other by the labels of
their names maybe planet does contain cliff-
hanger stuff but the cliff-hangers-ers da come
alive for at least the duration of the story

  and now for specific criticism

  the rebel of valkyr falls into the
class of old wine in new bottles but who cares 
this vintage is a particularly fine one and al-
fred coppel proves here that he has a keen his-
torical sense as well as the ability to write with
thrilling vividness that picture of the warlords
racing through space in technically near-perfect
ships lit by smoky oil lamps is a magnificent bit
of description that epitomizes the second em-
pires entire level of culture although the ending
liad a strong prisoner of zenda flavor it was
nevertheless effective and the tle simply cries
out for a sequel-perhaps more than one

  c h liddells the sky is falling
awfully reminiscent that title was a nice ex-
ploration of slightly abnormal mental processes
and a really dangerous phobia that is becoming
unfortunately only too common a well-written
yarn nothing extraordinary but distinctly prom-
ising better to come

  star ship displayed a marvelous instance
of restraint in titles-it could so easily have been
the kurse of khazak-but it really
didnt have much bearing on the story which


	planet

was pleasantly told poul andersons handling
of the clashing loyalties of his characters was
just a shade overdone but otherwise star
ship was truly interesting

  william shedenhelms patch repeated the
old familiar refrain that machines cant replace
human experience and ingenuity-and the author
knew when to stop and also how to include a
chuckly brand of humor

  aside from its somewhat queasy-making de-
scriptions strange exodus hadnt any
particularly remarkable achievements of char-
acter or plot robert abernathy has written bet-
ter stories especially novels and novelets he
seems to require a story-telling scope that the
shorter form doesnt permit him however this
certainly wasnt a bad story in such company
though it doesnt rate very high

  margaret st clairs meem may have had
great potentialities for irony or satire but it
didnt quite come off-the same problem as aber-
nathys short story insufficient space for devel-
opment

 the crowded colony-ah jay drex-
els tale deserves nothing less than superlatives
like alfred coppels novel it was a well-worn
plot superbly handled and beautifully ironic--
but events have a habit of occurring in just that
way its not hard to guess why another story
by this author is scheduled for the next issue

  if this be treason make the most of it ray
bradburys death-wish was not quite so
conspicuous for the reek of the charnel-house
as was some of his past work but the general
atmosphere was present as usual it is high time
that mr bradbury realized that death is an in-
evitable experience for all humanity that there
is no reason for regarding it with a morbid de-
light and that he is alienating a good many of
his readers with his persistent dwelling on
the horrors of decay and dissolution its true
that he possesses undoubted skill in waiting and
a fine literary style but if he were to turn his
talents to more constructive topics than the grave-
yard i believe his stories would enjoy a far
greater popularity and esteem than they do at
present by the way the title death-wish
takes a towering place on the list of poor choices 
it gave the whole plot away before the story
began

  this letter isnt very short either but i havent
written to ps for a long while and im catching
up on lost time

  congratulations again on an outstanding issue

                          sincerely

dear editor bixby

  my earnest thanks for helping me out on the
change of address concerning conrad johnson
this is one of the distinct traits of the coopera-
tion between editor and reader that distinguishes
fantasy and science-fiction from other fields

  the fall planet was received with open
arms for its bi-monthly announcement and be-
cause attraction of non-adventure stf jpalls

stories

when you consider the sum total of competitors
which hand it out planet alone mixes inter-
planetary yarns with occasional time-travel off-
trail and even sociological themes

  alfred coppel is not one of my favorite writ-
ers but he will be if asimov and the foundation
are presently inactive by all means let us hear
mr coppels views on the intricate machinations
of galactic empire rebel of valkyr is
the best ps tale since mcdowells green
death

  one comment here asimov borrowed the planet
kalgan from e e smith and alfred coppel
reciprocated by using it in rebel now the
question is not one of plagiarism since a com-
mon description of a galaxy benefits the reader
by placing him in familiar surroundings but
this where did smith get it 

  mrs st clairs meem was one of those rari-
ties in stfantasy a theme of sex treated adultly
and presented for obviously mature readers if
planet will pioneer in the use of sex themes
as it is used by novelists and not as employed
for titillation by the current rash of sexy
novels they will have as great a success as they
had with ray bradbury and altho i reserve
judgment here just look what rays doing slick
publication

  maybe ill write a sex-science-fiction novel for
you when ive  words to spare scintillat-
ing siren of space or valiant valkyrie of the
void yknow maybe whispering were-
winds of wilmas weasel-world    heyl

dear editor

  congratulations on  your new issue as you
seem to be endeavoring to take planet out
of its old rut i certainly hope you can do it

  concerning the lead novel are alfred coppel
and c l moore connected in any manner  some
of his phrases in this story are reminiscent of
moores judgment night in astounding some
years back it is as if a person were disguising
their handwriting but some of the traits showed
anyhow

  i cannot buy the basic premise of the story
people just dont act like that and forget every-
thing they ever knew please dont go poking
the fall of rome at me either as very little actual
knowledge was lost in the shuffle it was the loss
of a strong central government that did the dirty
work

  nor did it sound natural for the guy to walk
off and leave the girl just because he had made
her empress if he as a king could not have
her nobody could but history shows that people
dont act that way if they loved each other as
they were supposed to he would have become
her consort and aided her in ruling the other
way just didnt jell

  strange exodus certainly was unusual
to say the least i dont recall any story that had
just that way of solving the problem speaking
of  parasites though wouldnt some of our poli-
ticians have gotten along splendidly under those
circumstances i i could name quite a few that
the vizigraph	

have never been anything but parasites so they
would already be qualified

  pop gillette of patch was an unusual char-
acter and i rather liked him as i could appreci-
ate what made him tick perhaps we will hear
from him again in the future

 the crowded colony was another
story with an unusual twist i thought it was
going to be another one of those naughty earth-
men persecuting the poor little martians stories
that we have had now and then

  star ship was another good story the
theme was in reality the same as in the lead
novel however it was handled a lot better in
the short story to have events happen the way
they did in the novel every school library fac-
tory and every other thing that could recall the
psat would have to be wiped out in one szvcll
foop-ed also the people then alive would
know about science and they wouldnt lie to their
children and pretend that science was witchcraft
so nobody would understand it anymore the
people in the short story still had their knowl-
edge left so they built a modern culture so they
could regain their ship man is inheritantly a
builder so the shorter story was far more plaus-
ible

dear mr bixby

  congratulations upon congratulations two more
planets every blessed year it shouldnt be long
before you get up to the regulation number how
many planets are there anyhow

  the fall issue was crammed with fine short-
stories to those who seem to find bradbury an
inferior imitator of the expatriates of the
twenties id like to say that bradburys ideas
seem to me much more interesting than a lot of
the earlier stuff and that im unwilling to admit
as a drawback to any kind of story a style which
makes the action and surroundings of the story
exceedingly vivid

  the idea in strange exodus is a new
one to me and therefore most welcome the idea
of hln as a parasite on a larger organism can
probably be used several times more without
exhausting it

  meem also is a new one-or else the we
never crept past the censors before

  but the combination of the rebel of
valkyr and star ship in one issue make
me suddenly conscious of a paucity of thrill you
might ask the readers whether they think feudal-
ism intrinsically fascinating and the authors
whether feudalism is a necessary and probable
outcome of extended space travel personally
im glad were out of it for the time being

c h liddell whose novelet carry me home
is spotlighted in this issue is one of our new-
est and most valued contributors after read-
ing-and swiftly buying-several of his tales
we got to wondering about the man himself
 so we asked  so he answered meet
the creator of red rohan

  you are embarrassing me you know by in-
quiring into my quite ordinary way of life and
what makes me tick however i will answer
your specific questions the best i can and as to
my peculiarities i can only say that i have had
a terrific interest in scicnce and fantasy litera-
ture ever since i can remember being an only
child i found a lot of time to read-and i read
everything i could get my hands on i remem-
ber that once my father gave me a paperback
copy of the mysterious island by
jules verne to read my mother god love her
found that book in my room before i had fin-
ished reading it and took it away from me up-
braiding dad for letting me read such wild trash
dad ever a gentle man mildly defended mr
verne to no avail i believe this incident instilled
in me a deadly curiosity to know more about such
marvelous adventures which dad said were scien-
tific and mother said were trash i fear the
thirst has become an unquenchable flame

  i do not have a great deal of time for interests
outside of my work but i consider writing sci-
ence fiction and fantasy my hobby avocation-
relaxation i think i first got started doing it
because of my impatience with many radio pro-
grams which built up suspense and interest in
their plays and then fizzled out miserably in the
climax and more recently the television shows
have been doing the same thing only rarely
have i found a fantasy play which builds up to
a good climax and then has a decent one i
guess i grumbled too much for my wife finally
got exasperated and told me that if i didnt
like the endings of the plays i listened to to
write some of my own

 so i did and to my unbounded amazement
my stories are beginning to sell ive been for-
bidden by my agent to give him a plug so all
i can say is that i am grateful to the editor and
readers of planet stories for liking my mate-
rial and ill try never to let you down

  there we have a thumbnail sketch of charles
h liddell industrial research chemist of kansas
city missouri-one of the few writers who turns
out science-fantasy because he loves it and not
because he has to eat still in his thirties charles

h	liddell is happily married to a kansas city
girl and commutes five days a week to kc
mo to do laboratory research on week-ends
when mrs liddell hasnt other plans he loses
himself in the spinning of such stories as carry
me home

stories

me to read meem first it was outstanding
which is the highest compliment i am willing
to pay a stf story im not convinced that the
pulp field sprouts forth classics every few is-
sues i though that the crowded colony
would also be good but was disappointed the
plot twist which ended the story was clever but
the excellent anti-exploitation and anti-racist
theme was weakened if not ruined by thus con-
triving that terrestrial supremacy white supre-
macy should be upheld

  death-wish bradbury need never write
another word all he has to say is summed up in
that title and my congratulations to wayne
pryor and douglas creighton i dont like brad-
bury i have no taste for unrelieved morbidity
there was a time when i liked him i admit but
no longer and an increasing number of fans
seem to be experiencing a like reaction

  every vizigraph includes a few letters com-
menting on planets use of old-time inter-
planetary adventure fiction as contrasted with
the streamlined serious science story such
comments being hastily qualified with thats
okay thats the way i like it stick to your
present policies it may not be long before
planets type of literature will again domi-
nate the field and the tale of straight science
with its pretenses to serious significance be in
eclipse

  a change has come over science fiction within
the ten years or more during which ive been
reading it we read less today about glorious in-
ventions which will introduce the millennium
since hiroshima there has come about a wide-
spread feeling among the public dating from
some time previously among philosophers but
not generally accepted until the last five years
that science does not have all the answers nor
necessarily very good answers and it is not so
easy as formerly to write convincingly about a
scientific utopia note to weinstein please
dont bother replying to me i know your views
but i know also that increasing numbers of peo-
ple are coming to disagree with you in place
of the visions of bright tomorrows three themes
predominate  world destruction usually
atomic  super-scientific world of the future
represented as hell on earth  new adam and
eve escape into primordial world to start the
race over ouch-ed there is a certain
romantic enjoyment in such reading but nothing
to guarantee long-term appeal to the public of
any size

  the much-maligned stf thriller while it too
may have been influenced at the outset by the
prevailing optimism grander adventures than
ever awaiting mankind in that chrome-plated fu-
ture has due to momentum and reader appeal
remained almost unchanged it can be taken with-
out seriousness as enjoyable light reading-
and all intellectual pretensions aside that is what
fans read for even as anyone else and as the
scientific outlook darkens increasing numbers of
readers will wish to forget about it and read
for escape

  why not an illustration for sigler nobody
seems to like the fellow but he keeps coming
back undaunted such determination merits some
sort of award

ah jerome my boy   

   at last in all this seething futile mass o nutnan-
ty i have found a kindred soul at last i have
found an editor whose policy agrees with the
way i would run the magazine our minds think
as one romantic aint it if you were a beau-
tiful blonde id ask you to marry me    if the
dowery were right my daddy owns a bank-
ed

  no foolin ed you turned out a da   er   
darned good issue so good in fact that i cant
decide which story was best so i wont ill
divide first place between star ship and
the crowded colony the latter story
had a novel twist that caught me right when i
least expected it and andersons novelet was a
well-written well-plotted tale by an author who
i would like to see more of in p s january ish
-ed now that you have one big-name author
besides bradbury in your clutches how about
luring a few more ill bet van vogt could write
a thud-and-blunder story that would blow the
house fiction houses sales that is sky-
high other suggestions are theodore sturgeon
jack williamson l ron hubbard  on sec-
ond thought hubbards probably too busy with
dianetics by the way what do you boys think
of dianetics see article by james blish on
page -ed

  next i have to divide second place between
rebel of valkyr strange exodus
and patch rov sounds like a good background
for a series aw common ed give us a series on
this story  and on the rocketeers have
shaggy ears background too but i would
like to submit that of all the silly asses planets
stories have had for heroes kieron of valkyr
takes the cake but not the girl

  tied for third place are the remaining three
stories about which no comment shall be made
particularly bradburys

  i trust i expressed my sentiments about
planet going bi-monthly sufficiently in a previous
letter but anyway three cheers shoulda
ben did a long time ago

  turning to the vizigraph if i could id vote
myself number one spot    not because my letter
was so good no no it wasnt that good really
it wasnt  oh do you really think so   
wel-- if i have to admit it    but because
of your comments i darned near laughed myself
silly when i read them why dont you and i
collaborate ill write letters and you comment
on them well put them into an anthology and
make a million bucks since i cant vote for my
letter give originals to morton paley ed cox
r dee is not terrific and lin carter

  always theres got to be somebody who claims
that thud-and-blunder will drive ps from the
market but i beg to differ that it will not it
seems to me that there are two types of stf
theres the scientific science-fiction as repre-
sented by asf please jerry do not ruin our
beautiful friendship by following the example of
your predecessor and deleting the names of other
promags and theres the so called thud-and-
blunder science fiction as represented by planet

pare pork chops and ice cream theyre both
foods and there are good and bad ice cream and
good and bad pork chops in the same way there
are good and bad scientific stf and good and bad
thud-and-blunder but both are science fiction
planet prints good stf the great green
blight million year picnic and
others and unfortunately it also prints bad stf
it does not-ed oh yes it does    but
then so does every other mag personally id
hate to live on a steady diet of either and i
think that deep down in their dear little hearts
most of the fen feel the same way they read
and enjoy both types of stf equally well so more
good stories about space pirates and off-trail

dear jerry built editor

  after plowing and crabbing my way through
ps and la viz since i was twelve all of four
years ago and dont sneer i am now taking
typewriter in finger singular and hopping on
the bandwagon

  first some bone picking using an authors head
to start with of course vote mr she-den-helm
one large first quality raspberry and a copy of
the chemistry and physics handbook the day
he pulls a trick like that i want to be present
the unknown you can tamper with but leave us
leave known facts alone hoky-poky im refer-
ing to the fact that hg mercury to you dum-
bunces is almost as heavy as lead this you
could restrain with scotch tape i ha me doots

  there is no need of my knocking the cover and
blurb thereon they were so miserable and mis-
leading i thought i had the wrong mag however
the artist should have had guts enough to sign
the mess hes out of reach of the readers lucky
lucky guy

  now for the brickbats and bouquets

  	the sky is falling superfine nay
splendiferous at last here is an author who
knows astronomy im sick and tired of guys
who in writing about mars depict her moons
like ours when the fact is that the farther deimos
would appear only as a bright star and phobos
wouldnt give a much better showing

  	death-wish far superior to his last
misspent miscreation death-by-rain the
title gave it away though why not call it the
blue bottle or sumthin be that as it may
why doesnt ray write something equal to zero
hour or the pillar of fire these days
could it be hes overproducing his capacity

  	strange exodus two dozen roses to
mr abernathy

  	the crowded colony bueno good

stories

plot well written too bad the second pic wasnt
in the story i do so love a good wreck

  	star ship good to the last drop but
brother that was right off the cob well now
have a chorus of hearts and flowers however
credit the artist with the best pic of the ish maybe
i shouldnt speak such blasphemies but i think
he might even have read the story first

  	meem clever idea maby should boost-um-
up a notch or two say to tie with star ship

  	rebel of valkyr shades of bur-
roughs nuf said

  	patch filler material no doubt

  as to your rolling ball bix here it comes
back  bi-monthly hip hip hooray
best news since bradbury started writing sfi
 as to the sky is falling leave us
have more liddell  well still holler about
the covers  mitkey mitkey okay so im
stupid whos mitkey  the new format
yes yes triple yes ps now looks much less like a
collection of newspaper clippings and more like
a mag

  now to ostensibly more pleasant things la
viz viz    hapke velly funny chapkie me
laffie yet hey sigler try reading the story be-
fore knocking it hum or would this be too much
like work thank mr cox for straightening out
mr bradbury about venus he beat me to it
bye the bye congratulate the unpronouncable who
procured the pics for la viz clever people these
chinese

  well i realize that this was short for my first
opus to la viz but ive always got my tender
age and the lateness of the hour as an excuse
and after all its quality not quantity that counts

dear jerry 

  having just picked up the fall ps and natu-
rally glancing into the back of the ish i noted
with a twinge of nostalgia the scientifictioniana
you tossed in particularly the monorail illus

  for a moment i stood once more in a luxuri-
ous walnut-paneled study in a large mansion out-
side dusseldorf germany a bookcase reaching
from floor to ceiling was on my left and tall
french windows opened on a spacious if unkept
garden on my right i was investigating a collec-
tion of bound magazines dating back to the turn
of the century pulling them down from the
bookshelves and thumbing through them to my
hearts content featured were such ideas as the
mono-rail elevated helicopters dirigible air-sta-
tions for travelers wearing aluminum wings etc
and your illus from three lions was presented
as and i believe is the work of a german art-
ist i spent a singularly delightful afternoon
there

  the only bad thing about it was that i didnt
know whose collection this was-nor did i care
to know him there was a large color-photo of
hitler dominating one wall of the study a swas-
tika flag draping the wall behind the desk and
an open wall-safe indicating hasty departure i
had a thompson sub-machine gun draoe across
the vizigraph



 my middle and hadnt had a bath or a change of
 clothes in four months it was to be another four
 before i did

   and now i meet young fans who remember
 those times only as something they read about in
 their history books gives me the strangest feel-
 ing as though i were old as methuselah at
 twenty-five

   but you really should have mentioned the tur-
 tle in regard to that illus on submarine warfare
 the turtle you remember was a flat shell re-
 sembling a turtle though it floated vertically
 rather than horizontally it had ballast tanks op-
 erated by hand submerging the craft it had to
 be pulled up afterward it had an air-pipe and
 periscope and saddle-seat inside for one man
 a hand-operated crank turned a propellor in
 back and a simple system of wires and levers
 operated a small rudder an explosive mine was
 carried on top with hooks that would sink into
 the wooden hull of a warship held on by clamps
 that could be released from within

   i dont remember the name of the inventor
 but i remember reading that he submerged in this
 craft in new york harbor and cranked his way
 out to a british warship he tried to hook the
 mine to the hull of the warship but it wouldnt
 take hold and he finally had to drop it to the bot-
 tom of the harbor then he cranked safely back
 to the wharf and was pulled up some time later
 when the turtle was being moved to a new base
 of operations the ship carrying it was sunk

   this was during the american revolution
 about a hundred years before your unknown art-
 ist depicted submarine warfare

 dear editor

   well now youve gone and done it after all
 these years youve given in and made planet
 a bi-monthly  i liked your forthright declaration
 of principles except for one thing that same
 gruesome pattern of covers gawd elp us and
 speaking of covers last issues was a thing to end
 all things and i call it a thing because i cant
 think of an adjective harsh enough to describe it
 without descending into the depths of profanity

   will wonders never cease the hero didnt get
 the girl in the rebel of valkyr would
 have been a good story if the plot or should i say
 the background hadnt been so fantastic i think
 it and star ship were cut from the same bolt
 of cloth

   strange exodus was excellent the first
 new idea ive seen in a long time

   regardless of what most of your readers seem
 to think i like bradbury his backgrounds may
 stay the same but his twist to the end of his plots
 are magnificent many authors try to make a his-
 tory of space to fit in with their stories and as
 for you wayne pryor go take your three cents
 worth and buy some cheap poison with it

  the sky is falling and the
crowded colony are worthy of approba-

every bit as good as you claim in your editorial

hes good but  whereas the stoiy without

dear jerry

  the fall  planet stories was a welcome
visitor to my newsstand this nasty morning the
rain thundered down like bullets as i  oh
well

  first off id like to thank all those dear hearts
and gentle people who voted for me i was most
surprised when i found out i had won when i
read that letter in print i was very annoyedat
myself because    well  i detest the kind
of letter that says in effect im only  years
old and have been reading ps since summer
 and dont you think im very clever and
then i went ahead and did that very thing at the
end of my letter once more oh well   

  i wont even bother to comment on the deli-
cious new format its really fine and i hope ps
has reached its final physical form after  issues
of various changes

  the stories ah yes the stories coppel did a
better-than-fair job on his spaceopera for once
i finished one of his stories straight through to

stories

the end and liked it jay b drexel who could
this be he asked the soft green radiation from
his middle eye falling on those initials greedily
grabs second spot with a cute story reminds me
of bradbury in all but the words dont consider
this flattery soft-soap by any means drexel
didnt read the other stories too carefully but i
liked the bradbury who else and abernathy
yarns particularly the sky is falling
also sounds like bradbury monotonous the way
these guys imitate ray isnt it more from
liddell please would like to see some silver-
berg in ps too

  for the viz worthy recipients of pix should
be betsy curtis betcha i get and burn
more chain letters than you betsy ed cox
again ho hum and sneary whu give us
mor fun akting himslef than haff of the other
eddjicated leterhax combined i lkie his leters

 and i swear  on my sacred vol 
no  ps that i didnt just pick these three
cause they voted for me isnt it enough that i
rewarded them with proper libations and thanks
you should get a free pic yourself jb for your
exceedingly and excruciatingly funny comments
on letters in fact i will give you a pic the one
at the top of column  page  for a buck
more you can have not only the pic but the
models address oke

  planet stories is very definitely on the up-
grade after some weary lean years-  and
the first part of  i think that now every story
is worthy of at least one reading-which is more
than all the non-bradbury stuff can be of which
said however it might happen that the and if in
addition dont you think unless you already have
one-ed also it is evident that some of the
stories are of that semi-classic stature that
planet has eluded for many and many a month

  poul anderson st clair coppel and of
course bradbury are rated as top authors
drexel and abernathy will be there also in a
short time probably liddell shows promise-
but ive never never heard of shedenhelm thats
quite an impressive list of authors there only
brackett and one or two others are missing from
the group

  to sum up the first all-bixby issue of ps
shows such enormously huge steps forward that
im kinda overwhelmed keep this pace up in fu-
ture issues and ps will be up near the top among
the many many science fiction pulps

dear editor

  i am a novice at writing letters to editors but
when i saw buryi paynes letter in the fall 
issue i just had to write mr payne stated that
uranium has a half life of  billion years all
of the information that i could find said that it
was  billion years but i will forgive him that
error if it is an error but then he continued and
said that uranium has a whole life of  billion
years i would like to point out to him that the half
life of uranium is the length of time for half of a
given amount of uranium to disintegrate but when
this point is reached the remaining amount al-
though only half as large as the original quan-
the vizigraph



tity is still a given amount and therefore it also
has a half life of   billion years there-
fore this would continue ad infinitum conse-
quently the whole life of uranium is infinite
this therefore is the answer to his question
how come theres uranium left

  as for the age of the earth it is at least well
over  years as for the rest of
his questions they are included in an advanced
branch of cosmology and as yet cannot be cor-
rectly answered

  as for the stories i thought the crowded
colony was the best i am glad that planet is
becoming bi-monthly

dear mr bixby

  in the fall  vizigraph there are a pair of
comments about one azimov which seem to be
favorable and which naturally are highly grati-
fying to me think how much more gratifying
they would be if i could only be certain that the
references really applied to me

  i know of no science-fiction author named azi-
mov and am therefore taking the liberty of ap-
propriating the comment in a very high-handed
fashion on no other basis than that my name is
asimov and there is some possibility therefore
that it is myself they mean

  it probably seems picayune to worry about a
z and an s ill go further it probably is pica-
yune still people do enjoy seeing their name
spelled correctly so if it isnt too much trouble
mr bixby could you post a little note of instruc-
tion at the copy readers desk to the effect that the
name is isaac asimov with an s in
each name one s in each name

  you probably wont have much occasion to
worry about it two mentions an issue is prob-
ably way above average but every little bit helps

  thank you

                   very truly yours

ing the quality of your material to get enough
stories to fill six magazines a year instead of
four by all means go back to a quarterly basis

material isnt yet high enough that you can sac-
rifice quality for quantity

  ill put the rebel of valkyr in the number
one spot in your fall s issue for a reason
that needs some explanation it wasnt as good
a story from the strictly literary standpoint as
death-wish but of its type it is of high qual-
ity and i feel ranks higher in its field than the
bradbury story does in its the rebel is bet-
ter-plotted than most examples of what bradbury
has called the bingety-boom school of fiction
its ideas are more original granted the basic
premises it is more plausible and it is a more
completely developed piece of fiction coppel de-
serves encouragement this is his best and al-
thought he can still get better it shows more
promise than almost anything else he has done

  bradbury takes the number two position
mainly because this story isnt as good as death-
by-rain or any of the seeming hundred other
classics

  third place goes to the crowded colony
because of a technical flaw withholding the
information that burke and company the first
set were centaurians is justifiable only in the
surprise-ending type of story since the story
did not require the keeping back of that infor-
mation the result was confusion-thus spoiling
the storys total effect but drexel had a good
idea and should be encouraged

  fourth goes to your little gem the sky is
falling which was not maturely worked out
the st clair story meem rates fifth on the
basis of good writing but i dont understand it
very well sixth to strange exodus by default
and id hate to have to make the choice of which
was worse andersons star ship or sheden-
helms patch liddells yarn was all right for
a first effort but he needs more study and harder
work

  i dont see why bruce hapke of racine wis-
consin is so surprised because his english prof
is a fan im an english prof hastings college
and so is my wife same school  and im a fan
and she will be too if she hangs around me long
enough by the way if hapke were in my comp
class id give him a b for his letter and a stern
talking-to

well    not quite and dashed off a note to
planet was during the reign of planets
late lint-headed pterodactyl who captioned it
attention drug addicts you need have no
fear-nothing that violent this time

  everyone else has said it thus far so here goes
-greetings bixby i hope youre as competent
as plp hmmm fast it sounds like plop prob-
ably are anyway your interjections sound fun-
nier but then i have no sense of humor

  school days and final examinations having just
passed i turned to the somewhat moldy stack of
stf mags piling up near my desk the latest
one-the fall planet-was on top i read it

stormes

through first time in almost a year usually-
from september to june-i just rip through the
shorts should i have censored that-ed and
let the rest go for future reference that explains
the paucity of letters to ps happy but to
resume heres what i found

  ps is getting better

  ps is getting better

  yes ps is getting better

  for a long time i relegated ps to the bottom
of the stf pack then a few months ago
robert lowndes reintroduced future and i
thought aha zounds and shades of the bem
ps is no longer last next avon house brought
out its new stf mag and ps moved up another
notch add in the recent decline of a few others
and youre really going places after reading the
fall ish i must admit youve climbed up a bit al
by your lonesome

  perhaps ive always looked down on little old
ps because it is a space-adventure mag while i
prefer straight stf ala astounding but in your
area youre tops rebel of valkyr was a
tee-rif-ic space opera what prompted coppel
to use the holy names of historian quintus bland
and planet kalgan from the latest of asimovs
fine foundation series is coppel asimov
nah the clinchers in convincing me of your
reformation were two other good pieces meem
and strange exodus any unusual twist
gets me followed by the sky is fall-
ing on liddell he is good but is that power
and clarity im giving the story to my psych
professor i gave the bradbury-wolfe yarn to
my english prof grouped together afterward
were death wish nice but it did nothing
to me and crowded colony i liked the
idea but not the treatment-who is drexel  gad i
ive lost touch star ship is well done but
follows the hackneyed ps formula used year after
year after- patch was last but a neat piece
however there were no bad stories
in the issue that did it up you go on the
badler scale is there room im up to 
already quick the handball gloves

  about the future im glad to see you a bi-
monthly if all the issues can equal this but
im sorry too i have a vice-gad no-of buy-
ing and saving every stf mag that comes out
done it for the last half-dozen years its noi
the extra  that worries me but the space   
yeah but then when i start sending in those
manuscripts maybe ill have a better chance   
ok-bi-monthly it is

  to lin carters gone are the vastly amusing
entertaining letters of yesteryear   -thank

 fill in your own  protect us from a

return to days of hashish nightmares leave
us stay with the sane

            bem bye ever more

mitchell m badler

p s just joined the-lets see the card says-
national fantasy fan federation and theyd like
us to mention the nf in any letters we send to
promags so if you could   

  sure  more poiver to it and to all others of
the genus fantasociety now to get astride the
proverbial limb we predict flying saucer head-
lines within the year one guess students thanks
for the letters  see you nov st
