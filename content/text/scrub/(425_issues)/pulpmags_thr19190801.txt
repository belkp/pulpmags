the council of death

as the mexican secretary of state
opened the door to the cham-
ber of the council of nine one
of the councilors fell dead to the floor
and the other eight men collapsed in
their chairs faces twitching in the last
agonies of sudden death

the senor stood appalled barely
five minutes ago he had been summoned

by telephone to receive the formal re-
fusal of the council to the ratification
of a lower california land cession by
mexico to the empire of japan in-
asmuch as the president seldom failed
to accept the councils advice or to
abide by its action considerable inter-
national significance attached to its de-
cision in this matter the united
states was more than interested in the
outcome her diplomats in mexico
city eagerly awaited word of the


the unknown revolution

councils attitude in a matter so strongly
affecting the monroe doctrine and
the decision had been made but this
wholesale assassination-it could be
nothing else-was the result

  a faintness came upon the secretary
the sickening scent of flowers-red
roses set in a vase on the table-be-
gan to nauseate him pallid and trem-
bling before this sudden horror-this
mysterious doom visited upon nine of
mexicos ablest and most patriotic
councilors-he fled shrieking like a
man suddenly gone mad

  the administration palace soon was
in a turmoil the president when
given the dire news nearly collapsed
the mexican secret service took pos-
session of the death chamber all
wires and other means of communica-
tion were placed under strictest cen-
sorship not a word leaked outside
of mexico to the world in general con-
cerning the mysterious assassinations
diplomatic representatives under seal
of secrecy were informed and kept
their pledge of international silence

  but even they were not advised that
the roses in the council chamber had
been found upon analysis to contain
the deadliest secret poison known to
the mystic oriental east a close in-
halation was sufficient to cause death
within three minutes even at a dis-
tance as witness its effect on the sec-
retary at the door the poison could do
harm an electric wire connecting with
the flowers also was found apparently
having been used to explode a bulb
filled with the poison when the parties
interested in the signing of the docu-
ment were thwarted and found this
means of vengeance even while the
council awaited the approach of the
secretary the unsigned cession was
found upon the table the mystery
was how had any one known just what
decision the council had made and
how had the miscreant known just
when to time the explosion of the pow-

erful fumes which meant death to the
inhalers

  the only persons unmoved by the
great tragedy were the members of the
japanese embassy most concerned
its members were the most phlegmatic
asked for comment they merely
shrugged blinked inscrutable eyes and
discussed anything and everything but
the subject uppermost in mexican
minds

  although the censorship was the
strictest ever exercised by the mexican
government the news somehow became
widely known throughout mexico sin-
ister threats were made against the
president the peons especially be-
lieved he wished to make the land ces-
sion and had caused the deaths of his
councilors for stubbornly thwarting the
grant whispers of treachery swept
the nation

  villa the bandit leader lopez his
lieutenant zapata and other outlaws
including adherents of general blan-
quet and followers of the dead huerta
diaz and the martyred madero seized
the opportunity for fomenting open
outbreaks against the government in
provinces distant from the mexican
capital many outrages were reported
raids into united states territory be-
came more frequent to stir the ameri-
can government against the mexican
administration the presidents regime
became anything but secure revolu-
tion was in the air if only the banditti
could be united the administration must
fall some sinister mind apparently
was working to bring about this con-
summation

  it became more than ever necessary
to find the perpetrator or perpetrators
of the wholesale assassinations amer-
ican diplomatic representatives in mex-
ico city were especially eager to solve
the mystery every possible clew was
traced down without success ameri-
can newspaper men in the capital also
the unknown revolution



worked indefatigably on the problem
without result

  and then to add to the terror mex-
ico city soon began to hear weird tales
from numerous senators concerning
some mysterious presence in the capital
whisperings by invisible voices in their
ears and subtle intrusions into their in-
nermost thoughts

  the whispers invariably were heard
by statesmen who chanced to walk alone
through the great corridors of the cap-
ital ministers began to fear to think
upon matters affecting their govern-
ments because out of the intrusions
upon their mentalities had developed
counter plans to those they were trying
to formulate with respect to cementing
bonds of friendship with mexico con-
versations were rare indeed upon in-
ternational affairs men spoke of phan-
tom presences near them while walk-
ing through the building diplomats
cabinet officers legislative members
and all who were in touch with national
and international affairs began to avoid
the capital and to hold conferences in
secret places

  nervous persons actually declared
they had seen a phantom shape in the
capital corridors but whether the shape
were that of a man or a woman they
could not say the climax came when
senator manuel taguerrez emphati-
cally declared his arm had been grasped
by a phantom hand and that a sibilant
whisper had informed him he must re-
treat from his stand opposing the jap-
anese land grants or die

  two nights after his declaration sen-
ator taguerrez was found dead in his
bed a victim of apoplexy at least
apoplexy was the cause assigned by the
physicians but in the mind of the
american ambassador lurked a suspi-
cion which he soon was to voice to his
government that taguerrez had been
slain by a mental power so strong that
it could paralyze by suggestive force
the physical body of its victim

  meantime the revolutionary fever
was spreading far and wide it was
evident that a master mind was guid-
ing a systematic series of uprisings with
the purpose of cementing a union of
the bandit chieftains and to organize
a mighty force from the outlaw hordes
and the disaffected peons

  in this crisis the american ambas-
sador sent a coded message to wash-
ington urging immediate steps be taken
to circumvent the plotter or plotters
he laid especial emphasis upon certain
occult phases of the situation in mex-
ico heretofore mentioned and made
this point-blank statement

  sato nagati a japanese agent here
is behind the whole plot i am sure
american interests are at stake i be-
lieve sato is seeking to win the bandit
leaders to join forces overturn the gov-
ernment set up their own make a
treaty allying mexico with japan and
in return for japanese friendship and
help cede sonora and lower califor-
nia to japan nagati is dangerous he
is clever i have nothing tangible to
cite against him he is not a member
of the japanese embassy and they deny
all knowledge of him but i am cer-
tain they are working hand in hand for
their empire among other things na-
gati has a tremendous psychic knowl-
edge and possesses extraordinary tele-
pathic powers he also has mastered
astral projection to the point where
he can send his astral body or any part
of it to any place he desires it would
be well for the united states to ward
off this dangerous influence by sending
several of the ablest secret-service men
here i especially would recommend
the sending of bert brady walter
sprague and jack harding all of
whom are skilled in the psychic tele-
pathic and astral fields speed is nec-
essary the revolutionary element
grows stronger japan nears a foot-
hold america is in danger hurry
we must win


the unknown revolution

chapter il

deep waters

  a cting upon the american ambas-
sadors advice the united states
secret service dispatched to mexico the
three men recommended for the dan-
gerous task brady sprague and hard-
ing sprague ostensibly was an at-
tach of the american embassy brady
the mexico city representative of the
international press bureau and hard-
ing an american corporation represent-
ative seeking to protect oil interests
from sequestration each worked sep-
arately making weekly comparisons of
the fruits of their vigils by a secret
understanding with the mexican presi-
dent they were given entry everywhere
and access to any state documents they
might deem necessary to scan

  these three experts possessed minds
highly sensitive and flexible to their
wills they quite easily could read the
thoughts in minds untrained to combat
their influence even distance and
walls were no barriers to their pene-
trating intellects but try as they
would individually or collectively their
powers were no match for the wonder-
fully developed powers possessed by
sato nagati

  ive tried my best to read satos
mind said sprague as the trio one
night discussed the mysterious jap
rbut hes always on guard-feels my
mental probing of his mind and offsets
my influence by thinking of inconse-
quential matters whenever i try to in-
trude on his thoughts

same here commented brady

  and here added harding

  well have to excel him-hes still
master-if we wish to come out of this
alive said sprague lets practice
more

  accordingly the three men began a
series of weird experiments one was
especially intended to obtain the power
the jap could exert to paralyze or slay

a person by sheer mental concentra-
tion for this purpose they used dogs
as subjects at the end of a week
their already highly trained minds were
so developed that sitting in a room
concentrating mentally upon a dog in
the yard below each man could cause
the individual dogs death almost in-
stantaneously 

  then they experimented upon one
another not for the purpose of slaying
or paralyzing but for strengthening
counteracting influences or forces to
ward off danger of paralysis or death
through the mental concentration of
another person-sato nagati for in-
stance or any one else able to seal an-
others doom by mental suggestion

  to explain the theory they proceeded
on let it be understood that the main
basis of their experimentation was
along telepathic lines but telepathy so
highly developed that it went beyond
what normally is known of telepathy
for instance one mind happens to
strike a thought current sympathetic
with that of another mind and an im-
pression is created registered on the
mentality of each so for instance
i might think of you you might think
of me and we might tell each other
of it later marveling at what we would
describe as a coincidence but it is
not a coincidence it is merely a tele-
pathic juncture nothing else now
it is obvious that if this telepathic junc-
ture can take place without any mental
concentration whatever then it also can
be caused to take place by concentrating
the mental faculties another mind
similarly concentrating with yours ul-
timately can establish an actual method
of communicating thought from brain
to brain again it is manifestly more
difficult to impress a mind which is not
thus attuned to meet yours this
power perfected enables one to estab-
lish communication not alone with
minds impressionable but with other
minds not apparently open to impres-
the unknown revolution



sion also a perfectly trained telepa-
thist can communicate with many
minds at once

  sprague for instance as also his two
companions could apparently whisper
in a persons ear whatever he wished
to say and the person would believe
he heard a voice where really it was
but a mental suggestion again he
could make a person believe he felt the
touch of his hand where that persons
mind had merely received an impres-
sion that a hand was touching him
the mind in other words registers an
aural impression to convey the idea of
a spoken word or of a touch the
thought makes the mind revert to the
cheek for instance if the telepathist
wishes to convey the impression of a
hand smoothing the cheek of another
in other words it is a compelling of
the receiving mind to believe a hand
smoothes the cheek again in grasp-
ing an arm the thought registered is a
command to the receiving mind that a
hand is grasping an arm although no
hand actually touches the arm simi-
larly the telepathic powers of the trio
were so developed now that they could
force a mind to die

  not until their minds worked in per-
fect sympathy did they desist their tele-
pathic experiments then they ex-
perimented to perfect themselves in as-
tral projection at the end of the third
week the three men already well
grounded in this wonderful science had
developed their well-controlled spiritual
entities to such an extent that they could
send their astral bodies several feet
this achieved they experimented until
they could project their astral bodies
nearly a mile retaining consciousness
in the interval despite their grue-
someness these experiments were not
without some amusing features

  for instance harding and sprague
would project their astral bodies to the
center of a room and cause them to
dance together bow and scrape and do

all manner of absurd things this was
to achieve flexibility and quick response
to their wills brady then would pro-
ject his astral form and the three spirit
bodies would play ring around a rose
just like children in games while the
three men would watch and study their
spiritual entities

  nor is such a marvel new even in
the ancient egyptian days the priest-
hood held the secret and bequeathed
the mystery to our generation in their
mystic stories of ra-the inner entity
animating the flesh but science did
not rediscover the motivating principle
of projecting the ra-what we mod-
erns call the astral body-until quite
recently

  the three men found inestimable
help in the excellent treatise by pro-
fessor wilfred a pattison of the
american society of psychic research
himself a self-schooled student of as-
tral possibilities another written by
professor cornelius m devinney
whose researches in this particular field
have established for him an interna-
tional reputation especially for his the-
ory asserted in all reverence that the
reappearance of jesus after death was
the reappearance not of his physical
person but of his astral body and that
therefore he forbade his followers to
touch him these volumes they caused
to be sent from the national library
an institution maintained by the amer-
ican society of psychic research

  during their entire period of experi-
mentation which ended some two
months after their arrival in mexico
they gave no attention whatever to sato
nagati despite the urgent solicitation
of the american ambassador who was
becoming more and more alarmed at the
progress of the revolutionists they
told him it would be suicide to work
on the case before they were convinced
of mastery over sato and he perforce
had to be content

  and then just when the ambassador


the unknown revolution

was informed by them that they were
ready to begin operations against sato
and the revolutionists-harding and
brady disappeared

chapter iii

the enigma deepens

qprague alone met the ambassador
when the latter called at the grand
hotel

  where are brady and harding
asked the statesman

  gone was spragues laconic reply
although he seemed worried

  where 

  i shall find them

  but where are they

  even if i knew-secret-service men
never talk much you know they act
the ambassador bowed

  true he said

  tm left alone now to fight-w

  sato

   yes

  have you met him yet

  no i shall-to-day but i saw him
yesterday concluded sprague enig-
matically

  saw him yesterday why he
hadnt been in mexico city for three
weeks

  but  saw him insisted sprague
  the ambassador smiled

  ah i see he said astral projec-
tion eh  and you know that hes-

  on his way here interrupted
sprague i saw him yesterday-on
the road never met him personally
but i know him there could be no
mistake

  great heavens exclaimed the am-
bassador are we in to-days events
or back in medieval times

  there are more marvels to-day than
ever were dreamed of in the ancient
days when superstition ran riot said
sprague

  well id rather jfight a regiment of
honestly human soldiers than one of

these inhuman uncanny creations of
astral bodies or telepathic mentalities
whew

  the ambassador brushed his hand
across his brow damp with perspira-
tion sprague didnt blame him a bit
it was enough to frighten any brave
man

  sato knows were in mexico said
sprague but weve fought off his
mind so he believes were harmless to
his purposes you must leave me now
sir because i have much to do

  the ambassador rose he was won-
dering about the other two men but
even more he wondered at the courage
of this man sprague who alone now
was left to combat the wily jap

  sprague he said warmly holding
out his hand be careful or youll dis-
appear too

  sprague smiled if i do sir dont

worry he said because-

  because what

  lifes too short to worry
noncommittal as usual smiled the
statesman

  sato might read your mind said
sprague wamingly so it wont do to
let you know too much until weve got
sato caged

  and then both men blanched as a
mocking laugh sounded in their ears

  great heavens exclaimed the am-
bassador that was satos laugh
id know it in a thousand

  sprague had recovered his poise
he knows im on his trail-now
he said soberly and may the best
man win

  the ambassador trembling went to
the door and opened it and as he did
he reeled backward almost fainting as
a yellow face with eyes once seen nevei
forgotten faded slowly before his eyes
like mist before the sun

  sprague sprang to support him i
saw it too he said soberly it was
satos astral head i
the unknown revolution



chapter iv

sato nagati

yyhen the ambassador arrived at
his residence to which he had
gone immediately after the harrowing
experience in spragues room he was
startled by finding sato nagati in his
drawing-room waiting for him the
jap rose and bowed profoundly when
the ambassador entered

  your servant admitted me he ex-
plained i knew you were usually in
about this hour in the japs english
was no flaw of foreign accent

  glad to see you mr nagati said
the ambassador affecting a cordiality
which did not deceive the jap but
which he appeared to accept as genu-
ine sit down what can i do for
you 

  i came to ask your advice about in-
vesting some money in an american
mining stock said the oriental

 name

  texas spelter limited

  youd lose your money in that
stock sniffed the ambassador its
on the verge of bankruptcy right now

  thanks said the jap i nearly
made the investment now i wont

  the ambassador could not forego
studying the face of the man before
him it was strong and intellectual
deep-set penetrating black eyes like
somber pools shining in moonlight mys-
tic eyes seemed to cast a spell upon
him teeth set in perfect evenness al-
most dazzling in their contrast to the
japs yellow skin were disclosed when-
ever he smiled which was rarely he
always seemed thoughtful yet ever
aware of what transpired about hinu
his hands were delicate but strong

  is there anything else i can do for
you mr nagati asked the ambas-
sador

  no thanks merely called about
the stock said the jap rising

  he paused at the door

 a man named brady was found
dead just outside the city he said cas-
ually i saw him as i came into town
poor fellow the doctor said it was
apoplexy

  and as the ambassador started the
jap lithely swung down the steps lead-
ing to the street his face like a gat-
goylic image

  by telephone the ambassador in-
formed sprague of bradys death

  murdered-just like senator ta-
guerrez he told sprague i always
suspected the senator was killed

  he was came the mournful voice
of sprague and brady too i
guess

  but sprague was smiling-smiling
across the room at bert brady pale but
alive sitting in a chair and smiling back
at him

  when sprague rang off he turned to
brady

  nearly got me exclaimed the lat-
ter only for our practice id have
been dead now that yellow fiends a
master at our game but i know he
believes im dead because i had the wit
to deaden my mind you know how we
practiced that stunt

  sprague nodded you certainly
were lucky to have your wits about
you he commented sato sent his
astral head here just a short while ago
lay low brady how about hard-
ing

  hes-you know where

  fine exclaimed sprague now
brady make yourself scarce and get
out of mexico city you know the
plan did you find anything in baron
shi yats place

  nothing

  well they figure youre dead ill
bury you decently old man-stones jn
a coffin you know now off on your
other trail

  brady instead of going to the door
went to the window waving his hand
he stepped across the sill the window
io

the unknown revolution

was some twelve feet from the ground
sprague saw bradys hands gripping
the sill as he lowered himself then the
hands slipped off and brady was gone
on his mysterious mission

chapter v

senorita dolores perez

i ove casts nets about the hearts of
men at most unexpected and many
times inopportune moments and so
sprague became entangled that night
at a reception given by the american
ambassador among the guests was
senorita dolores perez niece of the
mexican secretary of state more
spanish than mexican with the pride
of arragonese blood pulsing in every
vein she cast disdainful eyes upon the
mexican gallants who sought her
smiles but the moment sprague and
she met that moment both were lost
in the meshes of loves weaving and
could not extricate themselves even if
they would which they would not

  though their lips said never a word
their hearts spoke-and their eyes-
that language which lovers the world
over understand

  spragues pressure on her hand as
they left the reception and she fared
homeward with her father was any-
thing but that of a casual acquaintance
nor was her clasp any less responsive
to her hearts dictates and sprague
walked on air strolling to his hotel
dreaming of her wondrous black eyes
her piquant little nose her coral ears
and ruby lips-just like any other lover
might do and thousands millions have
dofle before him so much did he
dwell upon her that he almost was
caught off his guard until he felt the
subtle intrusive working of sato na-
gatis mind trying to ferret from his
mind the plans he and his secret-service
aid-sato really believed brady dead-
were trying to consummate against the
jap and the mexican revolutionaries

  instantly sprague put up the barriers
of his own mentality against this intru-
sion thankful indeed that the jap had
obtained merely the knowledge that he
loved senorita dolores perez and that
his mind had not dwelled in the slightest
upon the tasks ahead

  but his thankfulness was to change
to raging fury when on the morrow
the city was electrified by the disap-
pearance of senorita dolores

  she had gone to her bed disrobed
and had fallen asleep according to the
story told by her mexican maid and
duenna the impress of her body on
the bedding still remained but dolores
was gone-without the slightest trace
with never a scream and seemingly as
though she had been spirited away by
supernatural means although such a
theory was ridiculed by the mexican
secret-service men called in

  in his heart sprague knew this kid-
naping was aimed as a blow at himself
but more than ever he became deter-
mined to end this terrifying activity on
the part of sato nagati and he sent
his powerful telepathic mind in search
of the jap but his efforts were fruit-
less sato was gone-gone from mex-
ico city at least-and must be sought
elsewhere this much sprague knew
without even stirring from his office
for had sato been within reach of the
subtle telepathic teachings of spragues
mind not even his powerful counterac-
tion could prevent spragues learning
of his presence in the city

  that day as mysteriously as had
brady and harding sprague disap-
peared heart hungry for dolores and
with vengeance glowing in his breast

chapter vi

the bandits lair

cato nagati glanced sidewise at
dolores strapped in the seat beside
him his airplane was soaring toward
the distant peak of monte cristobal a
the unknown revolution

gleaming crest of snow flashing against
the rich sapphire of the sonora skies
a smile of sarcastic triumph wreathed
his thin lips

  so he communed with himself
this sprague loves you eh well he
shall have a long hunt and these
dogs of mexicans-mongrels i must as-
sociate with for my emperors sake-
theyll never know sprague out of the
way i may let you return you white
beauty but not before

  dolores was inert deep in the leth-
argy of hypnotic sleep into which sato
had cast her before kidnaping her from
her fathers home her face still re-
tained the smile of adolescent joy with
which she had retired thinking of her
american

  rapidly the airplane neared the
mighty chain of hills over which monte
cristobal lifted its noble summit then
with a swift turn to the right sato
guided his machine in a long slanting
downward course landing gently in a
clearing just outside a low squat build-
ing much resembling but far larger
than the usual one-story adobe huts of
native mexican peons

  carefully unstrapping dolores who
gave never a sign of consciousness the
jap lifted her from the seat and walked
across the clearing toward the hut his
muscles of steel felt no slightest exer-
tion in carrying the burden and he did
not breathe one whit the heavier when
he arrived before the door it was
opened by another japanese who
bowed low before sato as before a lord
of the samurai

  the chamber is prepared asked
sato in his native tongue

  yes lord answered the other

  it is well

  sato unceremoniously brushed past
his assistant and into the main compart-
ment of the hut heavy silken por-
tieres were draped against the walls
hiding their ugliness several taborets
and teakwood chairs lent an air of

comfort to the room an idol-of
buddha-stood in a corner and incense
was burning before it

  sato bowed to the image once
twice thrice then placed dolores body
on a low divan disclosed when he re-
moved an ornate japanese screen from
its place in front of it he pressed
a button in the wall slowly the divan
with dolores upon it sank below the
flooring a few moments later he
pressed a second button the section
which had borne her down rose into
place and the flooring appeared as it
had before over the almost imper-
ceptible cracks sato cast a rug

  then with a face inscrutable as that
of the carved buddha he bowed thrice
again to the figure and stalked from
the hut his follower bowing behind
him closing the door but watching un-
til sato in his airplane was a mere
dot against the sky

  half an hour later sato stepped from
his machine in a narrow ravine between
monte cristobal and monte lorez
facing him stood a mexican rifle lev
eled at his heart

 the password demanded the
mexican

  buenos amigo  replied sato calmly
then speaking in mexican as the ban-
dit lowered his weapon is villa
here

  yes he waits for you

  good exclaimed sato tossing the
mexican a silver piece i have much
to do the hour approaches i shall
praise your vigilance to your chief
the mexican bowed as the jap en-
tered the defile and picked his way
through the rocky pass he passed sev-
eral banditti who glanced at him with
deepest respect and awe for satos
fame had spread through the outlaw
camps and he was feared for his evi-
dent supernatural gifts

  relying entirely upon his mental
power to guide him sato found the hut
in which villa awaited him and an-
	the unknown revolution

nounced himself to the guard at the
door villa himself hastened to the
threshold upon hearing satos voice
and bade him enter the two men
soon were in deep conversation

  one of the three americans i fear
is dead sato told the famous mexican
prototype of fra diavolo villas
mustachioed lips curled

  one american the less he mut-
tered what of the other two men
one is in my power smirked sato
the other is the weakest of the three
i can overcome him sprague is the
one i fear most he is resourceful and
always wide awake

  rwhich one is dead asked villa
  brady

  and sprague-whom you fear-is
in your power

  yes

  a captive

  no said sato but i have the
means of bringing him to his knees
a woman eh  surmised the bandit
shrewdly

  yes but enough of this question
and answ er i must hurry to the other
factions-zapata first

  villa frowned zapata ever had been
a thorn in his side sato hastened to
reassure the bandit zapata will join
with you he told the outlaw so will
the madero diaz blanquet and hu-
erta men ten days from now we
strike-for mexico and japan

  you ask much-for japan snarled
villa

  a trifle-sonora and lower cali-
fornia said sato lightly in return
for-

  yes interposed villa in return
japan for a time will be friendly
and then-pouf mexico is hers
nonsense you will be the ruler
of all mexico think of that your
rivals-wdl you neednt have any ri-
vals-if you help me the japs voice
and manner were unctuous his flat-
tery smoothed villas ruffled spirits

the vista of being all-powerful in mex-
ico and posing as its deliverer even
while fattening on its sufferings was
enough to cast into the background all
the suspicions villa entertained sato
read the bandits mind as he might a
printed page

  you will have all ready general for
the great attack on mexico city ten
days hence he asked

  i shall be ready answered villa

  it is well japan never forgets a
friend

  or an enemy exclaimed the ban-
dit

  but sato chose to ignore this parting
shot as he stepped to the door good-
by amigo next-emperor of mexico
he exclaimed bowing low to villa the
while his heart cursed the outlaw chief
as a mexican dog

  villa was standing in a dream of fu-
ture glory as sato passed out into the
sunset glowr which now cast a golden
glory upon the wild retreat of the most
redoubtable and ablest of the mexican
banditti leaders nagati hurried to the
narrow defile through which he had en-
tered he expected a guard to inter-
cept him and demand the password
but no guard appeared vaguely un-
easy sato peered around in a little
thicket he noticed the glint of a red
sash such as many of the villa men
wore he hurried to the thicket

  face dowti erstwhile bronze skin a
sick deathly yellowish white the guard
he had encountered lay-dead

chapter vii

a new riddle

yyith a curse of fury sato spumed
the dead mexican with his foot
vile dog he growled is it thus
you kept watch  he stooped and
turned the mexican fac upward
then with a start of sudden fear sato
peered more closely at the bandits fea-
tures
the unknown revolution



  he was not the same guard who had
demanded the password of sato and
even more startling to the jap the man
apparently had died of apoplexy
there was no mistaking the cause of
death

  with growing terror the jap raced
through the defile eager to reach his
airplane to see if it were safe pant-
ing not so much from exertion as a
combination of effort and nervous anxi-
ety sato finally arrived at the cleiaring
where he had left his aero

  his sky steed was gone

  the jap turned a livid white so
strongly overwrought was he his eyes
had the look of a hunted hare his
frame trembled with fury and terror
combined his lips were like two pur-
ple lines drawn back to bare teeth
tightly clenched

  for fully five minutes he stood thus
as though benumbed with the emotions
consuming him then his color re-
turned his eyes became calmer but not
less malignant and he studied the
ground around the place where his air-
plane had rested footprints were
there-large footprints-larger than the
average mexicans

  not sprague he couldnt be here
i left him in mexico city reasoned
the jap brady is dead it couldnt be
brady harding yes it must have
been harding but how did he get
here and have these men learned
the great secret-how to kill with
the mind alone great buddha
now am i facing danger indeed the
plane-they could have that-if only i
could get back what is in the plane
how can i return to my emperor with-
out that for which i have chanced death
a hundred times i must recover the
plane i must-or-he shuddered-
buddha have mercy for the mikado
will not

  shuddering with dread the jap re-
traced his steps walking quickly he
went unaccosted through the defile

where the dead bandit kept the vigil
of eternity a poor guard they keep
he sneered with one man only to
watch i must warn villa to detail
more men then-my airplane and its
secrets

  sato quickened his pace and came to
villas headquarters he brushed past
the guard and entered

 your guard-at the defile-is
dead he cried he is not the one i
saw when i entered

  villa started what he shouted
dead not the same

 no snarled the jap not the same
you should not trust to one man alone
general our enemies are strong they
have stolen my airplane too

  the bandit chieftain rushed to the
door followed closely by sato bel-
lowing a loud command which quickly
brought several of the banditti before
him villa picked out one of the men

  you were in charge of the guard
he asked

  si general replied the other i
put my best man at the entrance
who was he

  the americano you swore in-the
renegade who fled from his countrys
army draft and hated the united states
shall i call him

  did i tell you to watch him

  si general he always was vigilant
and he took the oath that means death
to him who fails he adopted our
dress he speaks mexican so i put
him on guard shall i change the
guard

  hes a traitor hissed villa and
you-you dog-you put him where he
might have ruined us all he has killed
one of our men who probably saw him
stealing away and he has stolen satos
airplane if you had watched longer
as you should he would have been
found to be the traitor he is but you
didnt and-his hand suddenly darted
forward gripping the throat of the man
h

the unknown revolution

he was addressing-this spells your
doom 

  under those strong fingers the mexi-
cans face turned purple his tongue
lolled from his mouth his eyes bulged
horribly he made a movement toward
his hip for a gun but villa gripped
his hand with his free fist and beckoned
to sato the jap nodded understand-
ing drew a knife from villas belt
and passed its keen edge through the
ribs of the struggling bandit-into his
heart a quiver and the limp form
sagged downward as villa with an
oath cast it from him to the ground

  the other members gazed spell-
bound villa turned to them when
i give orders obey-or die-like this
swine he snarled pedro turning
to one of the banditti you will take this
dogs place as chief of the guards see
to it you do not fail as he did or you
will join him in hell

  sato who had wiped the bloody blade
of villas dagger on the grass gave the
weapon to the bandit chief who thrust
it back into his belt

  i must have a horse said sato
time presses and i must move to re-
cover my plane

  at villas command one bandit hur-
ried to a corral where the horses were
kept and returned with a superb steed
fully saddled and bridled sato with a
word of thanks bestrode it and rode off
hell in his heart belying his apparent
calm exterior the trip he had made
in a few hours from mexico city by
airplane would require many hours on
horseback could he gain anything by
going to the capital  only the obtain-
ing of another plane that he must
get-and get it to-morrow if the plan
for a consolidated attack on mexico
city ten days hence were to be suc-
cessfully accomplished but to-day-
what could he do to-day

  and then with sudden panic he be-
thought himself of dolores perez his
prisoner in the adobe hut had the

man who took his plane also known
about her and if he did had he been
able to rescue the secretarys daughter

  sato spurred his horse with his shoe
heel as the steed turned into a fairly
good path through the wild terrain
suddenly he checked the animals
course cursing why didnt i think
of it before-in time he muttered sav-
agely why

  his body sat tense in the saddle
every nerve taut with the strain sato
suddenly put upon his astral powers
he was projecting his astral body to
the cabin where dolores had been left
a prisoner what he saw there can be
imagined by what his physical lips said
as a look of fury betrayed the story in
his heart tono yati-dead he
muttered lips livid and dolores-
gone sato suddenly seemed aged
and broken shall i fail

chapter viii

the rescue

catos mesmeric influence gradually
weakened and dolores wonder-
ingly awakened in a luxuriously ap-
pointed apartment lighted by electric
bulbs-an apartment she never before
had seen where was she she had
retired to her room and had fallen
asleep in her own bed and now-to
awaken thus-what did it mean

  slowly she arose and glanced around
eyes growing more wild and startled
as they took in the unmistakably japa-
nese decorations in this strange boudoir
in a panic she rushed toward the wall
seeking a door but she found no door
the walls were solid-earth covered
with concrete as she discovered by
moving aside the silken portieres cover-
ing them

  kidnaped the thought struck ter-
ror to her heart then came the ques-
tion  why had she been kidnaped 
dolores could think of no reason for
it-unless it were her beauty the
the unknown revolution



thought made her tremble she re-
membered now how several of the jap-
anese embassy members openly had ex-
pressed their admiration for her
charms sato nagati who was not a
member of the embassy especially hav-
ing made himself obnoxious by his un-
veneered advances he had not been
even polite she thought could it be
that he was her abductor she recalled
the many tales she had heard concern-
ing him and his occult powers his re-
morseless vengeance upon those who
stood in his way

  where was she how had she come
here had he wrought one of his oc-
cult spells upon her soul  it must have
been so dolores glanced upward a
wooden ceiling quite high met her
eyes heavy crudely adzed timbers
supported the planking which was of
better carpentry but there was no
outlet evident the air was close and
foul suddenly dolores screamed in
a frenzy of nervous dread she had
not intended to give way to her fears
but she was a woman and this situation
was more than she could bear

  she heard a sound as of a garment
swishing overhead tono yati was
pulling away the heavy rug over the
trapdoor but dolores did not know
this then a rasping sound smote her
hearing again from above and to her
amazement part of the ceiling de-
scended a few inches and remained
stationary she saw two iron rods ex-
tending upward and apparently run-
ning farther into the upper wall form-
ing the trapdoors support then a
yellow face leered down at her-tono
yatis

  you called v came his voice sneer-
ing in mexican

  let me out v shrieked dolores
you fiend t

  the lady is comfortable but hungry
perhaps said the jap i shall send
down refreshments his face disap-
peared dolores heard the patter of

his sandaled feet as he moved about
a few moments later he called down
here are rice and tea lady take
them from the string tonos yellow
hands appeared holding a tray sus-
pended from a cord and held horizon-
tally by four strands one from each
comer ending in an apex where the
cord for lowering it was attached as
the tray descended dolores saw a pot
of tea and a saucer of rice she was
hungry but should she eat suppose
the rice and tea were poisoned a
moments reflection however banished
this fear the japs had her in their
power they could slay her if that was
their design dolores was certain her
death was not contemplated so she
took the rice and tea a spoon lay
in the saucer of food

  when you have eaten put the dishes
on the tray directed tono yati from
above

  dolores sat on the divan upon which
sato had placed her when he had
brought her unconscious to this place
the divan was equipped with large
rollers and had glided off the trapdoor
of its own momentum the door when
reaching the cellar floor automatically
swinging to a slant by some mechanism
controlled by the operator above this
explains the method by which the divan
was run off the inclined trapdoor in
safety to the floor of dolores prison

  the girl ate the rice and drank the
tea she felt refreshed and stronger
better able to face whatever fate might
hold in store for her

  tono yati called down once to ask
if she had eaten the food but the girl
more to enjoy the fresher air admitted
by the open trapdoor than to spar for
time told him she would inform him
when to pull np the cord with the tray
and thus unconsciously she assisted in
weaving the web of destiny

  upstairs tono yati heard the croon
of a far-off airplane traveling toward
the adobe hut he went to the door
i

the unknown revolution

and peered upward the lines of the
craft were unmistakably those of sato
nagatis and tono yati wished to be
found diligently watchful when his
master alighted from the clouds

  more than an hour had passed since
sato had left the maiden in tonos
keeping and his return was not unrea-
sonable to expect so tono yati put
on his blandest smiles ready to greet
his lord with the intelligence that the
girl bdow was awake and not so sulky
or obstinate as to refuse food he
knew she could not possibly escape
from the cellar alone even though she
were to stand the divan on end no
other article of furniture could be su-
perimposed so as to give her hands a
chance to grip the edges of the flooring
where the trap opened and even if
she did get out she must flee through
the door at which he was standing-and
she was no match for him so tono
yati gave all his thoughts to his mas-
ters reception

  soon the machine alighted but closer
to the hut than sato usually stopped it
this little difference did not escape
tono yati but he saw nothing amiss
in the incident as his lord stepped
from the fuselage tono yati began
to bow and bow until finally a heavy
hand was placed on his shoulder and
a voice-not that of sato-commanded
in english let up wheres the

girir

  tono yati turned a sicldy color
then with a quick turn of his wiry
body he essayed to jiu-jitsu the new-
comer but he found himself in a
grip of steel he fought his right arm
loose and sought to draw his knife
then things went black for tono yati
as the american-attired like a bandit
and with skin stained to resemble a
mexicans-glared into tonos eyes
the japs form wilted his grip relaxed
and he fell prone-dead-before the
man who had stolen satos airplane

  sorry i had to do it muttered the

man but delay now might spill the

beans

  he rushed into the hut savf the trap-
doors opening and hurried to it peer-
ing through the crevice he saw dolores
looking upward as though his heavy
tread had startled her as contrasted
with the patter of tono yatis sandals

  senorita perez called the ameri-
can in mexican are you safe

  who are you  she asked startled

  a friend-never mind who ive
come to take you away to safety do
you know how to operate this lift

  no she answered

  the man sought-and found-the
button in the wall which sato had
pressed he likewise pressed it and
the trapdoor slowly lowered into the
cellar step on it senorita he said
dolores did so the stranger then
pressed another button in juxtaposition
to the first and the lift slowly rose
bearing its precious burden upward to
light and air and freedom

  ilm-m some class storage bat-
tery operates this ill bet muttered
the american he led dolores out
through the door the dead jap slain
by mental concentration similar to that
which had ended the life of the villa
bandit discovered by sato at the defile
and who had sought to stay the ameri-
can when he essayed to go to satos air-
plane evoked a shudder from dolores
the stranger hurried her past the
corpse toward the airplane in which all
unwitting she had been carried to this
place a prisoner and in which she now
was to flee to safety from the machina-
tions of the master mind of sato na-
gati

  in a trice she was strapped into a
seat the stranger took his place at the
wheel and in a moment more they were
soaring up-up-up-until dolores
head seemed to spin and ever that
roar-roar-roar of the powerful mo-
tor deafened her to all other sound
straight toward the northeast the stran-
the unknown revolution



ger headed his aerial craft urging it to
highest speed and as he flew he took
advantage of every scrap of cloud be-
hind which to hide as though fully
aware of the struggle he might be com-
pelled to face should sato discover him
in flight ere he hd outdistanced the
possibility of satos astral body being
projected up into the fuselage and un-
nerve him to fall or seek to cause his
death directly by occult suggestion

  whether or not this could have been
done the american could surmise only
as sato had not the slightest thought
his machine was being stolen or that the
rescue of dolores had been accom-
plished sato had lingered too long
with villa he had ridden when he
should have projected his astral form
in search of his plane-and thus had
failed

  but the airman taking dolores to
safety was unwilling to chance failure
by delay or lack of precaution conse-
quently due to the terrific pace at which
he flew and the high altitude he had
sought dolores fainted dead away and
did not know anything more until she
felt herself being unstrapped from her
seat in the plane

  where am i  she gasped even as
she opened her eyes

  nogales arizona united states
answered her erstwhile sky pilot glanc-
ing up from his task of unbuckling the
last strap which held her

  nogales she cried why thats

a long distance from- it cant be

possible v

  but it is true he said assisting her
to step from the machine you are
to remain here until everything is safe
in mexico if that fiend ever gets you
in his clutches again i wouldnt give
much for your chances

  but my uncle -

  he is being told where you are-
right now said the american my
partner is telegraphing but your par-
ents-

  atb

  are dead said dolores softly
uncle is my all

  put this blanket around you seno-
rita said the american stooping and
lifting out of the fuselage a thick
woolen one i had it around you
loosely while we were high up or youd
have frozen in the cold air i had to
remove it when i unstrapped you he
kept his face averted as he handed her
the blanket

  dolores was crimson with embarrass-
ment until now she had given not the
slightest thought to her raiment which
consisted solely of her silken robe de
ftnit she hurriedly draped the blanket
about her form grateful to the ameri-
can for his tact

  where now she asked

  he turned to her the american
general here will care for you senorita
your presence must be kept secret he
understands my partner saw me com-
ing and is making all arrangements
were just on the outskirts i dont
want the mexicans hereabouts to see
you so please bundle that blanket so
your eyes only can be seen then well
walk into town

  who is your partner how did you
let him know asked dolores amazed
by his matter-of-factness

  my partner he asked quizzically

hes walter sprague-

  here gasped dolores in even
deeper amazement but with sudden
happiness surging upon her

  yes answered the americanhe
came here by train i let him know
while i was flying here he was only
three miles away-just across the bor-
der i knew where to reach him it
was simple

  you-let-him-know came do-
loresvoice in wonder how
merely a matter of telepathy he
said lightly come-let us go you
must be hungry

  they were in a field not far from a
road dolores feet were bare and the


the unknown revolution

stubble anything but soft so the
american lifted her in his arms thus
they came to the road just as a horse-
man dashed up dolores glanced at
the equestrian then a glad cry burst
from her lips

  sehor sprague i

  he sprang from his steed thank
god he cried and took her in his
arms the airman relinquishing his
sweet burden to the lover and turning
away a few moments of soft con-
verse with dolores over sprague
placed her on his horse and turned to
the man who had rescued her

  good work brady he said heart-
sly

  brady flushed i suppose congratu-
lations are in order he commented sig-
nificantly glancing toward dolores

  they are said sprague happily
senorita dolores has honored me by
accepting my proposal

  brady gripped spragues hand with
eloquence deeper than words then
he said sato thinks harding took his
machine i guess

  naturally commented sprague
sato thinks youre dead and he knew
i couldnt reach monte cristobal as
soon as he could in his airplane but
what did you learn

  sato has nearly brought the bandits
to a complete union of forces ten
days from now they are to advance in
a body from all sides on mexico city
great heavens cried sprague
well have to hustle wait here for
me ill take dolores to the generals
home and return in a jiffy

  he sprang into the saddle behind
dolores hold fast he said to her
then urged the horse into a long swing-
ing stride toward nogales brady
watching until horse and riders disap-
peared around a bend in the road

  half an hour later sprague returned
on foot we must hurry to mexico
city and warn the president he said

have you enough gasoline for the
trip 

  brady who had reassured himself on
this score nodded the two men strode
off the road into the field and so to
the airplane dusk was falling and
most of their trip would be in the dark-
ness entering the fuselage and strap-
ping themselves into their seats they
began their long flight toward the mex-
ican capital little realizing the sinister
dangers soon to encompass them in
their efforts to circumvent the designs
of sato nagati

chapter ix

the soul of madero

in mexico rumor travels faster than in
any other nation especially if the
supernatural is involved a zapatist
named barto buenta in guadranoz a
tiny town sixty miles south of mexico
city told some of his fellows that he
had been accosted by a spirit which
had gripped his arm and whispered in
his ear

  what did the spirit say asked one
superstitious listener

  it said i am the spirit of francisco
madero beware of the japanese
keep mexico for mexicans then it
faded away

  eighty miles south of the capital lies
irrientos a village of some four hun-
dred residents-men women children
and dogs here likewise a zapatist
asserted a ghost had placed a phantom
hand on his shoulder and murmured
beware giving mexican land to the
japanese i am maderos spirit warn-
ing mexicos friends again as i did in
life against her enemies

  similar stories bobbed up at points
more or less distant as other peons
were visited touched and addressed by
the shade of madero than whom no
mexican ever was more beloved by the
downtrodden lower classes of the mis-
guided republic diaz men encountered
the unknown revolution



the phantom and received the same
warning and to add to its solemnity
another ghostly visitant would proclaim
itself the shade of diaz and tell its
listener to beware the plans contem-
plated by the leaders to make an alli-
ance with japan the same experiences
were retold by men in the villa ranks
the blanquet forces and even in the ad-
ministration armies

  murmurs of dissatisfaction began to
spread over the land as these warnings
gained headway losing nothing of their
force in the retelling but like all ru-
mors gathering more and more fanci-
ful additions as the imaginations of
the story-tellers conjured up new de-
tails the japanese began to be looked
upon with distrust and aversion the
bandit leaders themselves hearing the
tales and being very superstitious
found their willingness to play into the
orientals hands dwindle daily the
climax came when maderos shade paid
a visit to the tent of the indian leader
zapata himself

  zapata was asleep outside his tent
a guard stood watching but humans-
cannot guard against the spirit world
zapata felt a hand brush his cheek he
awoke startled a spectral form hov-
ered near his pallet a hollow voice
proclaimed i am madero in life
i fought you in death i warn you be-
ware how you play into the hands of
japan for so sure as you yield and
join the traitors who would give mex-
icos beloved lands to that country so
surely shall you die i have spoken
beware 

  slowly slowly the phantom dissolved
before zapatas eyes he was alone
but japan never would cajole him into
signing an agreement for land cessions
now and slain in april he never
signed uncommunicative as he was
zapata nevertheless could not refrain
from calling in his guard and telling
him the tale spread like wildfire

  and on its heels jack harding not

the least able of the three ablest men
in the united states secret service
drifted back into mexico city on the
selfsame night that his companions
brady and sprague arrived in the air-
plane of sato nagati

  harding was sitting in his hotel room
scanning a newspaper when brady and
sprague entered on the floor lay a
mexican costume he had worn in his
peregrinations through the bandit dis-
tricts on the bed he had carelessly
thrown a wig of matted black hair his
face was a huge grin as he rose to wel-
come his comrades in peril

  got your telepathic flashes the mo-
ment i hit the city he said shaking
hands with sprague and brady sit
down

  weve got sato on the run said
sprague hes scared

  and his machine asked harding
hidden in a patch of woods three
miles out-a place where nobody is
likely to stumble on it-off the south-
west road you know the place
harding nodded no one likely to
see it there he commented how
did you get the machine

  brady told him then asked harding
for his story

  well drawled jack i played the
astral projection stuff on the peons-
told them in telepathic whispers that
i was maderos ghost or diazs shade
or huerta-according to my whim and
the district i was in i even got near
enough to slip my astral body into za-
patas tent to warn him against japan
sprague nodded admiringly i was
wondering what your plan was he
said i knew youd play the astral
game but i never thought of such a
stunt as impersonating the spirits of the
dead leaders some stunt eh brady
brady expressed his admiration for
hardings cleverness and daring but
the latter waived their plaudits embar-
rassed the thing weve got to do


the unknown revolution

he said slowly is to catch this sato
hagan

  easier said than done commented
sprague but i agree with you we
must-or--

  good-by monroe doctrine sang
out brady

  and mexico added harding

  for nearly two hours the trio dis-
cussed their dangerous mission and
plans to bring it to fruition in favor of
the administration and of america
then with cordial handclasps they sep-
arated each man going to his hotel
brady first borrowing one of hardings
suits in exchange for his mexican ban-
dit costume but retaining his facial dis-
guise and assuming a fictitious name in
registering at a small hostelry

  next day the three men expectantly
began a search for sato nagati but
sato was not in mexico city

  probably hasnt arrived yet
growled harding lets take the day
off and have a little relaxation

  the three men accordingly passed an
enjoyable day giving no thought what-
ever to their mission lest it spoil their
pleasure harding invited brady and
sprague to his room for a game of
pinochle and they assented sprague
somehow felt uneasy as they ap-
proached hardings room some pre-
science of evil bade him be cautious
whatever caused him to do so he could
not explain but he urged brady and
harding in a whisper to stoop low
and set them an example by doing so
himself

  harding placed his key in the latch
his head lower than the keyhole turn-
ing the key he pushed the door open

  as he did so out blazed a flash of
light a shot crashed and a bullet
tipped over their heads

  still crouching harding sprague
and brady rushed into the room re-
volvers drawn

  not a living soul was in sight

chapter x

the ghost watch

liar dings room had two win-
dows it was situate on the sec-
ond floor of the hotel and was rather
large it was furnished with two desks
twin beds comfortable chairs
screens and other comforts a bath-
room used conjointly by harding and
the occupant of the room adjacent to
his lay between the two rooms

  harding rushed to the door of this
bathroom stooping before opening it
lest another shot lay him low sprague
with a pantherlike spring sought a
window and glanced down to see if
any one were running off not a per-
son was in sight brady gun ready
to fire searched behind the screen and
under the beds but their efforts were
unavailing whoever fired the shot
must have had some means of escape
other than the bathroom or the win-
dows

  a trapdoor through the floor the
thought struck sprague as he turned
from the window and called to hard-
ing nobody here

here either returned harding

  must have been a trapdoor
sprague remarked the three men ac-
cordingly glanced about the floor seek-
ing telltale saw marks or crevices
what they did see caused them to gasp
with astonishment at the simplicity of
the device set for their assassination

  in their rush into the room they nat-
urally had sought a human form and
then hastened to points of egress en-
tirely overlooking what they now gazed
upon

  directly in their path had lain and
still lay a wooden lath one of the ordi-
nary rough-edged laths used by car-
penters in forming a basis for the plas-
tering of walls it lay near a revolver
which had been fastened to the floor
l-shaped screws such as housewives
use for holding curtain rods in place
the unknown revolution



being utilized to keep the gun in posi-
tion beneath the trigger guard had
been placed a tiny block raising the
muzzle to an angle nicely calculated to
send a shot directly into a mans heart
as he opened the door the lath ap-
parently had been used to cause a pres-
sure on the trigger exactly as a human
finger would have been used it had
been braced against the door the other
end against the trigger so that the mo-
ment the door was pushed inward the
pressure would force the lath against
the trigger and cause the revolver to
belch forth its leaden death

  the men stared at one another in
silence then they solemnly shook
hands

  thank god you thought to bend
low said harding to sprague

  i dont know why i did nor why
i warned you fellows but something
seemed to tell me everything wasnt
quite right mv mind was uneasy the
moment we hit the landing explained
sprague i had a subconscious feel-
ing danger was near us-and it was

  lets have a look at that gun said
harding as brady picked it up

  brady handed it to him and hard-
ing broke it removing the cartridges
from the barrel

  the fool wasted these good car-
tridges anyway he grinned slipping
them into his pocket together with -the
empty shell

  what make is it asked sprague
referring to the revolver

  american he said reading off the
name of a well-known revolver and
gun-making firm sato knows a good
gun anyway

  lets look the room over a bit said
sprague

  what for asked brady

  footprints-fingerprints-something
to help us

  harding produced a magnifying
glass so did the others they exam-
ined the revolver but found dull blurs

only the screws likewise held no dis-
tinct impressions the doorknob re-
vealed nothing it was apparent the
villain who had set the trap had worn
rubber gloves

  sprague directed his attention to the
floor here he was rewarded shoe
prints-rather small-were impressed
distinctly in the rug near the bed and
upon the dust on the varnished floor
he measured them carefully jotting
down the accurate memoranda there
were no peculiar marks about the im-
prints they were clear smooth and
distinct as though made by a new shoe

  satos murmured sprague while
the other two men nodded

  they went downstairs apparently
the shot had not been heard or if it
had no one had been alarmed they
learned that a japanese had called to
see mr harding and when told hard-
ing wras out had asked and obtained
permission to slip a note under his
door

  anything wrong asked the clerk
i thought i heard a shot

  i dropped my gun said harding

  the trio went upstairs sprague sug-
gested reporting to the police but
harding who was smoking hard at
his abominable pipe immediately
frowned down this plan

  wed better keep quiet he said de-
cisively it cant happen to us again
-unless were fools

  vhat do you mean harding
asked brady

  mean why all weve got to do
is to send an astral advance guard
ahead of us to look over the ground
he said in other words apply your
own astral body to the task in your
case brady you yours sprague and
ill do the same in the event of our
working separately at any time or in
entering our rooms

  the other two brightened at the sug-
gestion

  incidentally harding sprague


the unknown revolution

said we ought to keep a close
watch for a return visit why not keep
our astral bodies on guard here con-
tinually 

  too exhausting he commented
why not just the head

  eh  cried the other two astounded
just so he answered quietly ive
been experimenting and have found it
possible to slip an astral eye a finger
a toe the whole head a leg-in fact
any portion of my body-wherever i
wish to send it it doesnt tire so much
as sending the whole astral body
they stared at harding in amaze-
ment

  are you sure exclaimed brady
sure just watch me he laughed
they noted the peculiar look in his
eyes as he concentrated his mental en-
ergies for the task now sprague
he said look over there-in the cor-
ner

  sprague and brady both glanced
where he indicated hardings face ap-
peared outlined perfectly against the
background of wall paper no body
supported the head but the eyes winked
and the spectral face smiled

  bully cried sprague how do
you do it

  very simply he said recalling to
his physical entity the apparition he
had projected into the corner you
merely exert your projecting power in
divisions for instance to send the
entire astral body from you you must
exert your entire thought over every
portion of your body subconsciously
the mind thinks of every portion in this
case now by merely deciding to pro-
ject your head-or your eyes or ears
or hand and so on-you merely con-
centrate on them alone instead of the
whole body try it

  brady and sprague both tried the
experiment sprague projected his as-
tral hand to the corner where hardings
face had appeared it was clearly de-
fined and at spragues will opened

and closed its ghostly fingers brady
sent his eye in projection to another
comer and found it easy to control it
to wink or close its lids and do other
seemingly impossible things they
were astounded by the ease with which
they could accomplish these marvels
and congratulated harding on his dis-
covery

  you see said harding we can
leave one eye here to watch for the next
visitor if any other visitor comes to try
another shot at us if we take turns
we can do it without fatigue the oc-
ular vision of the astral eye communi-
cates what it sees immediately to our
minds and meantime we can search
for sato

  correct said sprague we might
as well start right now

  thereafter the men maintained this
ghostly watch over their rooms but
while no further visit was made by
any hostile agent harding and sprague
felt ever and anon the tentacles of
satos super-mind reaching into their
brains for information and they were
hard put to it to prevent his learning
their plans brady whom sato still
believed dead did not experience this
mental intrusion

  four of the precious ten days before
the fruition of the japs dastardly plan
to make a revolutionary attack on
mexico city had passed only six
days more remained in which to com-
bat him and prevent his master mind
from leading the banditti into concerted
action

  brady had slipped away to continue

hardings method of arousing the peons
against the attack on the government
lest japan get a foothold in mexico
through the bandits success

  harding and sprague gloomily dis-
cussed their failure to find sato hard-
ing puffed vigorously at his vile pipe
adding to spragues mental misery with
each puff until finally sprague began
to stalk up and down the room glar-
the unknown revolution



ing at hardings apparent comfort he
was sitting in his accustomed pose feet
on desk chair tipped backward eyes
raised to ceiling sprague often had
envied his apparent phlegmatism in
hours of stress but this afternoon he
experienced an irritation which threat-
ened to weave words he might regret
uttering so taking counsel of pru-
dence he told harding he was going
downstairs to buy a newspaper

  harding must have divined spragues
mood but he also was irascible and
made no comment continuing his pro-
voking puffing

  downstairs trudged sprague desir-
ing nothing more than to walk himself
out of his mood if walking would do
it he approached the exit and was
about to step into the street when he
suddenly beheld-sato the man for
wrhom all three had been making such
an unavailing search

chapter xi

trapped

cato did not so much as glance at
the entrance to the hotel he was
passing-the place where he had set
a trap for the death of one or more
of his enemies his walk was as non-
chalant as though he were on a holi-
day promenade sprague stood in a
daze and thereby nearly lost sight of
his quarry for sato had rounded the
comer some seven doors away before
sprague had recovered from his aston-
ishment

  sprague almost ran to the comer
and was agreeably relieved to see his
prey walking apparently without any
thought that he possibly was being fol-
lowed the american used every pos-
sible device for shadowing his man and
succeeded in trailing him to a private
house some six blocks from hardings
hotel sprague first had decided to ar-
rest him but had changed his mind

wishing to discover if possible some
tangible evidence of the plot sato was
weaving he knew sato would deny
everything and that mexico would give
the jap the benefit of the doubt-for
fear of japan so he loitered around
as inconspicuously as possible until
nearly an hour elapsed then sato re-
appeared the jap glanced furtively
around as he descended the steps of
the house he had changed his suit
sprague noticed this then must be
his residence

  sprague decided it would be much
better not to dog his steps he appar-
ently was going out upon some social
call unsuspicious of danger it would
be far preferable if he could gain en-
trance to the house sato occupied and
snoop about a bit to discover anything
discoverable decided sprague ac-
cordingly he watched the jap walk
several blocks down the street and turn
a comer

  sprague studied the house sato had
left it seemed the least likely place
in the world for a murderers abode
the windows were curtained with
beautiful lace drapings a few pieces
of furniture wrere visible-that is the
upper parts of them-and they were
of ornate design and apparently ex-
pensive

  it was evident to sprague after
carefully pondering the matter that
sato delving into the most dangerous
waters of international affairs would
be well protected from intrusion he
unquestionably would have secret
alarms for unwary hands or feet to
touch or some unseen protectors other
than ordinary servants sprague felt
an inclination to summon harding to
aid him but smothered the inclination
as soon as it was born when he thought
of hardings irritating pipe besides
while a foolish resolve the human ele-
ment of selfishness where glory is con-
cerned entered spragues mind he
believed he could do the exploit alone


the unknown revolution

and caution fled before the enchantment
hazard lent to this adventure

  so he determined to pit himself
single-handed against the power which
had demonstrated its might and crossed
the street to the house deciding an
open bold course was the better one
to take

  he strode up the steps to the landing
and pressed an electric push button
he heard a bell ring faintly far in the
rear of the house and waited patiently
for some one to open the door a min-
ute passed which he counted second
by second his heart beating wildly de-
spite his apparent external calm
somehow his ardor for adventure
cooled in that minute of tense waiting
but no one came to the door and he
rang again this time a little longer
then he waited again-one minute-
two minutes-three minutes there
was no response

  no one home i guess muttered
sprague

  he paused hesitant what next to do
then with a summoning of all his
nerve he entered the vestibule and
grasped the doorknob he turned it
to his surprise the latch clicked and
he felt the door yield to his gentle pres-
sure opening inward this was luck
indeed

  sprague entered swiftly and softly
closed the door the hall was rather
dark evening being near and no light
lit in the hallway or on the stairway
which reached before him upward to
regions he yearned to explore a feel-
ing of awe crept upon him-a wonder-
ment akin to terror-an impulse to turn
and flee but he sternly repressed this
impulse and slid against the wall every
sense alert no sound broke the
silence-unless the ticking of a clock
somewhere in the house could be termed
a sound

  he made several strides forward
cautiously silently stealthily at the
entrance to the drawing-room sprague

glanced in it was deserted it held
no interest for him sprague was cer-
tain that whatever of value was to be
discovered would be revealed in those
chambers upstairs not here where
every chance visitor might stumble
upon things not meant for his eyes

  emboldened by his apparent security
sprague stepped across the doorway
and reached the opposite side of it
where he again slunk against the wall
fty this time he was within a few steps
of the foot of the stairway he made
the necessary strides forward and
reached the first step upon which he
gingerly placed his right foot

  hardly had he touched it when the
hall was flooded in radiant light and
sprague felt an electric current pulsat-
ing through his system like daggers
thrust into every nerve

  and as he struggled to free himself
from the grip of the electricity sprague
felt the world go black he heard a
mocking laugh then he felt himself
falling-falling-falling into endless
abysses-and knew no more

chapter xii

a choice of deaths

a dazzling beam of light
brighter than mortal eyes ever
beheld then intense darkness dank
impalpable tomblike the ringing of dis-
tant bells anon rumbles of thunder
crashing and reverberating amid far-
off clouds then silence again deep
profound terrifying a dizzying whirl
of worlds a blinding flash again-and
sprague awoke from the deathlike
swoon into which he had fallen-awoke
to find himself bound hand and foot
a gag in his mouth and shooting pains
in his eyes preventing his seeing any-
thing for a few moments

  gradually his vision cleared and he
made out a small room lined with sheet
iron riveted against the walls and an
iron door barely large enough for a man
the unknown revolution



to enter sidewise and not quite five feet
high an electric light burned above
set in the ceiling which sprague no-
ticed likewise was ironclad the air
was foul and heavy although not damp
and he realized he must be in some
underground prison artificially aired
but not sufficiently so to be comfort-
able

  he strained at his bonds but they
were too well fastened each struggle
but caused the cords to cut deeper into
his wrists and ankles sprague cursed
the folly which had led him into this
trap set by sato nagati what hope
for him thus bound and hidden from
all possibility of human ear to hear or
human eye to see why had he not
counseled with harding why had he
been such an unmitigated fool as to
presume he had the intelligence and
power alone to cope with such a gifted
enemy as this jap who had trapped
him 

  he gazed helplessly about the room
his temples felt as though they must
burst he pressed his teeth against the
gag only to desist because of the pain
caused by gritting them against steel
his jaws ached his wrists were swollen
to abnormal size and his ankles caused
him excruciating agony

  the silence appalled him rather
would sprague have heard the din of
battle the clangor of iron foundries
anything but this sepulchral quiet it
made him feel as though he were in a
tomb well what else was it but a
tomb  he thought bitterly and he had
wilfully stepped into it again he
gritted his teeth impotently against the
gag again he had to desist

  reason slowly was returning and
teaching him the folly of uselessly
wasting his strength he lay quietly
then and tried to find some ray of hope
upon which to hinge a chance of de-
liverance but the more he thought
the more hopeless he considered the
outlook no one knew where he was

no one knew he had stalked sato to
the mysterious house invaded so incau-
tiously no one was aware even of his
disappearance because it could not yet
have been prolonged enough to arouse
alarm and when harding and brady
would find him-if they ever did find
him-it would be too late to help him
who had been walter sprague secret-
service agent of the united states gov-
ernment

  the pain of his bonds nearly made
him swoon again and despite his effort
to prevent it sprague gave vent to a
deep groan through his gag no sooner
had he done so than the little door
opened and a japanese face peered
through the aperture grinning at him
the upper half of the face was cov-
ered with a mask sprague almost
laughed at the apparition because of
this to him absurd attempt to conceal
an identity from a man hopelessly en-
tangled in a mesh from which escape
was impossible

  the face disappeared the door
closed

  hideous as had been the grin on the
lips and malevolent the look in the eyes
peering through the mask sprague felt
he far rather would see it than lie thus
without even an enemy to interest his
fancies he groaned again this time
louder again the door opened again
the face with its grin sprague gave
a loud moan of anguish exaggerated
but real

  the door opened and the masked
jap entered he was not more than
five feet six inches tall he was slen-
derly built slope-shouldered wiry and
quick he wore a black serge suit and
patent-leather shoes only his uncov-
ered jet hair yellow skin and black
eyes betrayed his origin otherwise he
might have passed for some stripling
youth to be encountered anywhere in
america he came toward sprague
catlike in tread and manner

  you suffer sir eh he said purr-


the unknown revolution

ingly rubbing his hands it is not
safe to combat japans wishes many
have tried many have died but i
shall spare your life if you tell me
where i can find my airplane he
paused his smile turning to a sinister
scowl and his beady black eyes gloat-
ing over his victim wondering what
great significance attached to the re-
covery of the plane but determined
never to reveal its whereabouts
sprague shook his head in a vigorous
negative

  then you must die exclaimed the
jap i am sorry but you are in the
way i am going to be merciful to
you though because you are a brave
man

  again he paused sprague won-
dered what fiendishness was originat-
ing in the ingenious brain of his enemy

  seldom do i give mercy when foes
are in my power continued the jap
especially when they refuse to tell what
i would know but i shall break my
rule this time-only this time i shall
get my information from harding
but i forgot-pardon me sir-that you
cannot reply to me he stooped and
deftly released the gag you need
not call for help he told sprague
you are fifty feet below the surface
you would only waste your voice be
reasonable as a brave man should as
i know you will be his voice had
a purring sound much like a cats com-
fortably fed sprague ground his teeth
in impotent rage the jap smiled gra-
ciously

  i feel the kindness of your heart
toward me he said and i am touched
indeed it moves me to give you an-
other choice than the two i had in-
tended to give you-

  choices muttered sprague
choices of what

  of how you wish to die the jap
replied smoothly without a trace of
emotion isnt that a kindness-when
i could blot you out in a moment for

refusing to restore my airplane i
shall give you three choices you can
choose either-without hindrance you
can take the easiest or the hardest as
you will no one ever will know which
one you choose because when i leave
you i shall not return no one but
myself-those who built this place are
dead because their knowledge of it
was dangerous-knows about this little
room i even shall go so far as to
release you from the bonds that keep
your hands from trying to kill me

  he laughed a rasping malignant
laugh of triumph

 are you sato nagati asked
sprague but i know you are why
use a mask

  the jap removed it preening him-
self i am he said almost gently
i am the scourge of your government
-the genius of japan-the beloved of
the mighty emperor of nippon
sprague watched him fascinated
why are you the scourge of my coun-
try he asked

  all japanese hate america said
sato bitterly because america refuses
them citizenship-refuses to recognize
them as equals when they are supe-
riors then glaring at sprague he
shouted you white dog why
should i give you mercy-you who
would crush out the light of japan
you who would strike at me and
through me at japan of a sudden
he calmed i beg your pardon sir
he said genially his mood again sar-
castically kind whenever i think of
the ostracism america and odier white
nations exercise against my country i
become excited so would you eh
especially when any one humiliates
your country yes you understand
is it not so he bared his teeth in
a manner that reminded sprague of a
dog showing its fangs i must go
sir continued the jap i am so sorry
because you are a good listener i al-
the unknown revolution



most regret that your cars soon will

never hear again-

  what cried sprague you will
deafen me 

  ah sir you wrong me exclaimed
sato i never torture an enemy no
your ears will not be injured nor will
you be hurt in any way by me that
is my kindness when i should be stem
and merciless i wonder at myself
sir yet i ever was given to admire
courage and you are brave no your
ears will never hear again-after you
are dead he smiled again that tan-
talizing mocking sinister smile which
first had greeted spragues awakening

  ah said sprague smiling back at
sato i see what you mean

  you delight me sir

 and now said the american
what are the choices you shall give
me

  these said sato first i shall
leave with you food sufficient to pre-
vent your hunger or thirst for twenty-
four hours

  in other words my first choice is
-starvation asked sprague a horror
creeping upon his soul

  correct smiled sato again i
am delighted at your quick perception
second i shall leave you a vial of color-
less tasteless fluid--

  poison

  exactly it kills as quickly as it is
swallowed-no agony no pain only a
falling asleep the easiest way i can let
you die the third is not so bad either
a box of powder which if you inhale
it--like the council of nine inhaled it
-will bring you calm eternal slum-
ber sato produced from his right-
hand pocket a tiny vial filled with color-
less fluid this he carefully set on
the floor some three feet from
sprague then he reached again into
his pocket and extracted a small round
box made of aluminum in shape and
size much like those given by druggists
with orders of quinine pills this he

likewise placed on the floor next to
the vial i shall have to go sir he
said softly i assure you i shall not
remain to watch which course you take
i do not wish to gloat over my enemies
when they are brave

  sprague watched him too fascinated
too dazed to say a word

  please turn over on your side sato
requested so i may release the cord
from behind then you can work your
wrists free otherwise it would be im-
possible to do so

  sprague turned as directed realizing
that if he had any chance it could be
possible only with freedom of move-
ment he felt a knife severing the bond
about his midriff which had kept his
hands against his abdomen the wild
thought came to him that he might turn
in a flash and grasp this fiend with
his bound hands but he dismissed
this thought it might whip sato into
a frenzy and cause him to kill his vic-
tim outright

  now sir said sato moving away
i must say good-by-and wish you
the easiest death of the three may
the mighty emperor of the samurai
forgive me if i have erred in showing
mercy once more i swear by all i
hold sacred to free you-if you will tell
me where to find my aero satos tone
was anxious and sprague again won-
dered what great importance attached
to a machine which sato could dupli-
cate with ease but he shook his head
in the negative even more decidedly
than he had shaken it before when
sato made his first request

  a bow of the slender figure grace-
fully courteously made and sato was
gone the door clicked behind him
sprague was alone-alone with three

chances to die- ha  sato had not

given the three  he had left no food

  sato sato shouted sprague

  the door opened and the jap peered
in you will tell me-you will save
yourself-my airplane he asked


the unknown revolution

  but sprague shook a negative you
have given me but two choices he
told the yellow man the food-
where is it

  ah i had forgotten smiled sato
pardon me here it is he ad-
vanced a few feet and placed a loaf of
bread and a pint flask of water on the
floor again sir he smiled i wish
you the easiest death you have called
for the hardest good-by 

chapter xiii

despair

cato disappeared through the iron
door and sprague again was alone
this time he heard a bolt slip in the
lock and knew sato meant to return
no more at first the american lay
still in an apathy of despair but he
was roused from this by the pain in
his wrists and ankles bethinking him-
self of satos suggestion that he could
release himself sprague struggled at
his bonds it was comparatively easy
to free his ankles now that his hands
were not bound against his midriff
this relief brought a more consuming
desire to release his wrists he strug-
gled and struggled but the cords bit
deeper the more he strained at them
yet he could not desist if he wished
to be free so he yanked away at his
bonds until blood began to pour from
his wrists and drip from his linger tips
there was no protuberance in the wall
against which he could rub the cord
and fray it he was beginning utterly
to despair when he chanced to glance
at the accursed liquid poison in the
vial he had refrained from looking
at vial or box lest he be tempted to
use either to avoid suffering now he
laughed laughed like a madman first
then with more sanity as he thought
what an idiotic exhibition he had made
of himself and the unnecessary pain
he had suffered

  he could have broken this vial and

cut the bonds long since with a frag-
ment of its glass he stooped over and
picked up the vial between his bound
hands staring curiously at it it held
liquid which held instant death for the
quafter suppose he should break the
glass and spill the fluid one of his
chances for easy death would be gone
he knew the time would come unless
some miracle released him that he
would rave around the cell praying
god to bring him death and that he then
would be happy by a mere draft to
ease forever the pangs of flesh even
as he stared the temptation came to
take this course now before suffering
untold horrors of starvation fifty
feet below the surface of the street in
a place known to but one man in the
world-what chance had he to expect
succor he continued to stare at the
flask without making a move to de-
stroy it such was his fascination that
he forgot his pain thus he stood for
a long time held in thrall by thoughts
full of melancholy and hopelessness
then heaving a sigh the better nature
of him triumphed over this fatalism
and he tapped the flask gently against
the wall it did not break or crack
with the first contact he was about
to try again a little harder so as not
to smash the glass into fragments too
small for his purpose when another
thought came upon him this time giv-
ing him a literal understanding of the
expression freezing ones marrow
suppose the bottle held a fluid which
released to the air would cause death
by inhalation of its fumes as well as
by imbibing it 

  sprague in horror withheld his hand
and considered this possibility it was
a master stroke of machiavellian cun-
ning thus to leave a flask with which
sprague might sever his bonds-if he
lived to sever them sato evidently
had calculated on just such a situation
probably even now he was laughing
over his jest thought sprague bitterly
the unknown revolution



  awakened now to the possibilities of
this vial which had become a thing
most preciously to be protected
sprague gripped it tightly yet fearful
of pressing too strenuously lest it break
and envelop him in fumes of doom

  then the pain of his bonds gnawed
again at his resolution to avoid break-
ing the glass his hands were swollen
and blue smeared with blood some
freshly red some blackly clotted he
bit his lips in frenzy the agony of
his wounds added to the horror of his
plight and he stormed the room in tor-
ture he actually wept with the pain
and hopelessness of it all

  finally when he could bear no more
he decided to trust to the honor of
even such a fiend as sato and to break
the vial there was no use holding
his nostrils tight as he broke the glass
but he did so instinctively trusting to
god to help him in his hour of direst
need he knew he must release his
nostrils ultimately in this awkward
position both hands to his face he
broke the vial against the wall the
fluid splashed on the floor were it
not so tragic the spectacle sprague pre-
sented would have been amusing both
hands tied tightly together the fingers
of one gripping his nose the fingers
of the other holding the upper half
of a broken vial a few inches from
that same proboscis unable to move
either hand away for fear of inhaling
deathly fumes yet unable to risk drop-
ping the precious glass for fear it might
shatter to bits too small to be useful

  but a man must breathe and sprague
knew he could not hold out much longer
before requiring air he hurried across
the room as far away as he could get
from the wet stains on the floor and
the splashes on the wrall where he had
broken the vial then holding out to
the last possible moment sprague ven-
tured to release his nostrils his face
was nearly purple before he dared to
inhale had death then come to him

he would not have cared much so over-
wrought was he but death did not
come and he rejoiced that he had taken
the chance

  sprague sat and pressed the precious
fragment of glass between his knees
jagged edge upward then ever so
carefully he drew across the sharp
glass the tautened cords binding his
wrists until the strands began to snap
one by one and he was free but now
came a sharper pain-the return of
blood to the extremities cut off so long
from circulation so agonizing was
this pain that sprague deliberately sac-
rificed some of his precious pint of
water to allay the agony

  to regain his strength he boxed with
an imaginary opponent chafed his
wrists and ankles ran around the room
and turned somersaults until complete
normal circulation had been restored
hunger came but he fought against his
desire to eat of the precious loaf
thirst began to gnaw at his throat
his exertions had stimulated both thirst
and appetite and it required all
spragues will power to refrain from
eating and drinking but in the end
he conquered he did not know how
long he had been without food there
was no time measurement in this living
tomb only aeons could measure the
passage of the hours so infinitely long
did each moment seem his watch had
stopped many hours since and he might
have been without food for a century
judging by the ravenous hunger upon
him often he had fasted for two days
but never under such conditions as
these what with thirst hunger pain
hopelessness he felt no inclination to
fight much longer yet so strong is
the urge of self-preservation that he
fought down this subconscious inclina-
tion to yield

  ultimately worn out with the riot
of emotion and the strenuous physical
experiences he had undergone sprague
fell asleep dreams came banishing


the unknown revolution

real rest horrible nightmares wild
beyond the wildest fancies haunted
him throughout his slumber so that
he was really more tired than refreshed
when he awoke incidentally he was
hungrier and thirstier

  he began to gloat over the bottle
and loaf as though he were hoarding
the riches of a midas he fondled the
bottle and caressed the loaf taking
deep longing sniffs of its crust until
in an ecstasy of self-denial he fairly
shrieked nor will the reader wonder
at spragues suffering when told that
sprague up to this period had been
confined in the dungeon for nearly four
days add to this the fact that he had
eaten but a light breakfast and even
lighter luncheon the day he fell into
this trap and some conception is pos-
sible of his sufferings as he knelt be-
fore the bottle bowed and scraped be-
fore the bread and grinned idiotically
at the walls and ceiling of his cell not
a hope for rescue how could any
one reach him thought sprague
wildly the question dinned into his
ears-dinned-dinned-dinned-until
he finally ceased his madcap antics and
grasped the bread in frenzied hands
and took a great bite chewing it raven-
ously then he let half the water
trickle down his parched throat this
restored him to reason and calm he
studied every crevice in the walls
where rivets held together the sheet-
iron sections they offered no hope
the door resisted his utmost strength
not even rattling in its firm framing
the ceiling was just high enough to
be out of reach nor could he hope to
gain anything by piercing it anyway
he reasoned he would encounter an
arched bit of brickwork supporting the
fifty feet of earth above the cell

  hours passed and nature craved for
more food more drink the same
struggle began again this time more
horrible more poignant with suffering
more distracting than before and with

less hope left because half his proven-
der was gone thus again sprague
was reduced to a madmans plight until
he again yielded and ate and drank
what remained of the japs meager
allowance truly had sato spoken
thought sprague this was the hard-
est death

  and now indeed hope seemed en-
tirely lost he sat gloomy-eyed gaunt
haggard glowering at the tiny alumi-
num box of powder in the center of
the room he could bear little more
he was a wreck hardly able to drag
himself across the floor at first he
shrank against the wall in the farthest
comer to avoid the fascination of the
powder box but gradually ever so
gradually he moved toward it until
finally he tremblingly grasped the
tempting receptable his teeth chat-
tered one breath of this powder and
then-peace

  sprague stared hungrily at it as he
had stared at the last morsel of bread
ere he had consumed it then timidly
he began slowly ever so slowly to
loose the metal top from the under
portion of the box

  he had it halfway off

  nerving himself for a sudden grab-
bing away of the lid-the inhaling of a
hasty breath his nose close to the box
-sprague breathed a prayer to god
for forgiveness a prayer for the punish-
ment of sato nagati then drew the
lid three-quarters of the way off-
a little farther--a little farther-till
barely a thread line of space remained
for his fatal inhalation of the death
fumes when-god i he thought of his
wonderful mental power-his astral
projections-his thought communica-
tions with harding by telepathy

  in a panic of dread lest he be too
late he snapped back the lid on the
dreadful box and with trembling fin-
gers laid it on the floor then with
every energy left to him sprague sent
out his mental s o s to harding
the unknown revolution



  come to me harding i am dying p
he sent speeding his telepathic com-
munication come come quickly
he projected his astral eye to hard-
ings chamber and saw him sitting at
his desk head between hands deep
sighs fluttering his lips tears dropping
on the blotter before him sprague
then projected his astral head directly
on the desk in front of harding and
saw his startled stare then across
space through walls and sheet iron and
fifty feet of earth sprague heard his
telepathic response coming hold
on  where are you 

  with his astral vision sprague saw
hardings face brighten with hope saw
him rise and spring to the telephone
then hesitate

  i havent enough strength left
to continue my astral projections
sprague flashed mentally and withdrew
his astral head

  where are you came hardings
repeated telepathic query

  fifty feet under earth sprague
flashed back in a room lined with
sheet iron in the grip of sato almost
starved to death the room is under

the house at- street i shall hold

out now until there is no hope come
come come

  sprague fell exhausted face down
nor could he rise again when he essayed
to do so he barely had strength left
to receive hardings last mental call
im coming-hold on then came
unconsciousness mercifully to ease his
torment and he knew no more

chapter xiv

the laugh of sato

ljazy in effect yet subtly intrusive
sprague began to feel a mind
working upon his as he slowly returned
to consciousness and realization that he
had a chance for life it was a ques-
tioning force gradually he made out
that the telepathic voice was asking in-

sistently where is my airplane
where is my airplane where is my
airplane and then he knew the mind
of sato nagati relying upon his weak-
ness was anticipating an answer in-
stantly sprague made his mind a blank
then he began to feel a paralyzing in-
fluence and it dawned upon him that
sato was trying by mental force to kill
him even as the mexican senator
villas bandit tono yati and the dogs
had been slain in horror sprague
braced himself to counteract the influ-
ence and finally knew he had suc-
ceeded then he caught hardings tele-
pathic flash  coming-hold on and
returned a feeble reply after a while
he managed to creep to the wall and
braced himself against it sitting up
in this position he felt stronger

  harding was coming-coming with
help to force the dungeon door the
very thought brought new vigor to
sprague and he trembled with eager-
ness but he was too weak long to
endure such excitement and he deter-
mined to exercise the same phlegmatism
which had sustained harding in many
a serious predicament he realized that
he needed every atom of strength to
combat the paralyzing influence of
satos mentality which he could feel
again seeking continually to find
sprague off his guard

  suddenly however this influence
ceased sprague experienced a wild
hope that harding might be near-that
his immediate rescue would take place
gradually he became drowsy despite
his hope and will he slept a few
moments then awoke with a start a
thought had come to him in sleep that
he could use his astral power to guide
harding to him-that he could use his
astral eye to learn the route to the un-
derground dungeon

  in the sudden strength of a new
joy sprague projected his astral eyes
beyond the iron door and saw a nar-
row space not more than eight feet


the unknown revolution

square directly opposite the outer
side of the door he saw an opening
doorless apparently the inlet to a shaft
upward this proved correct and with
astral vision sprague glanced up the
dark shaft but he could not discern
anything in the black void in the
light reflected from his electric bulb
sifting through a crack in the door
sprague was able to see the faint out-
lines of metal runners on either side
the shaft however indicating it was
an ordinary elevator shaft this lift
then had been used to carry his un-
conscious body down to the cell
sprague reasoned the lift must be
at the top having been used by sato
in leaving this place he found this
conjecture true also when he recalled
his astral eyes and projected his astral
hands along the runners to the top
where he could feel the bottom of the
lift

  satisfied on this point sprague re-
called his astral hands and projected
his eyes outward from the shaft and
into the house where he had been made
prisoner he scrutinized the wall but
found no trace of an opening nor any
break in the wall paper the opening
however must have been here he
determined so to guide harding that
the searching party would break
through the wall here and find the lift
in the shaft ready to carry them down
to rescue him

  sprague recalled his astral eyes and
set about the task of finding the means
which ventilated his room search
as he would however he could not
discover how the chamber was venti-
lated nor did he ever learn and now
tired from his exertions in the astral
field sprague again felt sleepy and
was beginning to nod when he suddenly
felt hardings mental processes again
at work upon his

  were rushing the house came
hardings flash

  hurry flashed back the prisoner

  then sprague exerted himself no
more unable to bear up under the
strain and determined that he would
reserve his last remaining strength for
the ordeal of guiding harding by astral
means to the blank wall which must
be demolished to reach the shaft some
minutes later harding flashed

  were in the house nobody here
sprague roused himself and sent
eager reply i shall send my astral
body as guide

  he knew it would require every iota
of his remaining strength to accom-
plish his purpose but he tackled the
task with grim determination he suc-
ceeded in sending his astral body to the
room where harding and twenty mex-
ican policemen were gathered he saw
the fearful glances the gendarmes cast
at his apparition several devoutly
crossed themselves as though to ward
off the evil one harding however
explained and they gathered courage
spragues astral hand then pointed to
the wait harding nodded-sprague
could see everything with his astral
eyes-and waited for more informa-
tion sprague made his astral lips say
while his telepathic message likewise
followed suit cut through-elevator
shaft and lift

  then came oblivion as sprague on
the verge of collapse recalled his astral
form before it might be too late and
fell in a dead faint on the floor of
his dungeon

  harding told him afterward how his
rescue was accomplished the day
you left me to get a newspaper ex-
plained harding when sprague was
fully recovered from his terrifying ex-
periences i knew you were dis-
gruntled i attributed it to the strain
under which we had been laboring
when you did not return for supper
i thought you were giving yourself time
to work off your grouch but when
day succeeded day without your re-
the unknown revolution



appearance i became frantic with fear
i sent telepathic calls to longer dis-
tances than we ever had attempted but

got no response-

  i was fifty feet down smiled
sprague no wonder your concen-
tration was all above ground

  well continued harding x got
the mexican police secret-service men
everybody possible on the job to look
for you i had given up hope when
your astral head appeared why didnt
you let me know sooner

  i could have done so admitted
sprague shamefacedly but i forgot all
about my powers until the last des-
perate moment even then i dont
know what caused me to remember i
was so distracted that i lost all control
i guess

  well thats past now said hard-
ing soothingly

  and the airplane asked sprague
with sudden thought of the importance
the jap evidently attached to his ma-
chine

safe and sound-where we left it
sato was very anxious about that
machine said sprague wed better
search it it may give us some sur-
prises

  well we can do that when we
please said harding the main
thing is to give this devil sato a taste
of american justice

  you can just bet we will cried
sprague grasping hardings hand with
enthusiasm

  and then despite their nerve and
courage both men blanched as a hollow
laugh sounded in their ears

  sato they exclaimed then stared

chapter xv

the eve of revolution

that night came brady haggard
weary almost dropping from fa-
tigue to report that the revolution had
been put off for three days for some
atb

purpose or reason he had not been able
to learn harding explained how
sprague had been captured and res-
cued and attributed the delay in satos
plans to his anxiety for the stolen air-
plane and his remaining in mexico city
until he should have obtained informa-
tion of its whereabouts

  the mexican authorities are seed-
ing sato everywhere since an uncon-
trovertible charge can be brought
against him by sprague said harding
even the japanese embassy cannot
lift a hand for sato under the circum-
stances lest it appear to condone satos
murderous activities but so far search
has been futile we shall have to take
him ourselves if we can find him
a thought strikes me on this point
said sprague eagerly

  the two men glanced at their leader
the jap has been able to reach otir
minds he explained as they nodded
we have never been able to reach his
but we might be able to eh

  whats the dope asked harding
if we cooperate and criss-cross our
telepathic lines as it were we may be
able to find him suppose for instance
you harding go to the southern end
of the city and cast your telepathic
influence in a radius of three miles i
shall go to the northern end and do
the same brady can tackle the west-
ern end if this fails to find the jap
even by the slightest mental impression
he must be somewhere in the eastern
part of town we can then draw our
lines nearer to each other and by a
triple concentration in a smaller area
find exactly where sato is hiding
and suppose we find him-what
then  quizzed harding

  arrest him

  harding laughed outright do you
think that fiend would be taken alive
he ridiculed i guess not

  alive or dead-it doesnt matter
said sprague

  well admitted harding it does


the unknown revolution

ound feasible after all if he can
reach us we certainly should be able
to reach him

  especially with three minds work-
ing at once added brady

  next morning harding sprague
and brady took their posts as sched-
uled and began the weirdest search
ever made in all history they worked
carefully and could feel each others
mental flashes but not a token of
satos presence was indicated slowly
they converged to an agreed rendez-
vous and by two oclock in the after-
noon were so close to each other that
prague flashed the others to join him

  when the trio had gathered sprague
said it is evident sato isnt in those
three quarters ill stay here and flash
for sato while you fellows take the
posts agreed on last night in the remain-
ing district work toward me but go
slowly-and carefully lest we miss the

jap-

  the two he addressed separated and
went to their stations resuming their
occult scouring of the citys remaining
quarter at four oclock sprague
caught an excited flash from brady
gose in  came his call ive located
him on -- street

  sprague flashed the message to
harding and the three men in a few
minutes merged forces in the street
brady had named

  its the fourth house from the cor-
ner said brady excitedly leading his
companions to it the building was
a small frame one two stories high
hes in there-asleep said brady

  sprague turned to harding call
up the diief of police he said ask
him for ten men brady and i will
keep guard until they come we may
get him alive we must have enough
men to cut off every avenue of escape
hurry

  harding dashed off in a few mo-
ments he returned with the information
that police autos were rushing to the

place five minutes later the police
cars rounded the corner and dashed to-
ward the three americans sprague
directed their operations

  two of you watch the third house
he instructed and two the fifth two
more are to enter the cellar of the
fourth house where sato is two to the
front stair and two to the rear my
two friends and i will break down the
front door there is extreme danger
-so beware when i whistle keep
your eyes open

  the men hastened to their positions
allowing five minutes for all to take
their proper places sprague whistled
loudly and the three americans burst
open the front door careless of dan-
ger reckless with the mad desire of
locating the man who so nearly had
caused his death sprague sprang ahead
of his men the parlor was vacant
harding rushed to the rear rooms no
one there he hastened back sprague
already was halfway up the stairs
brady close behind both had drawn
their revolvers and had covered their
faces with handkerchiefs to ward off
the throwing of any death-dealing pow-
ders harding hastily took the same
precaution and followed hard on their
heels

  they reached the landing in safety
and searched the front bedrooms no
sign of life they dashed to the rear
rooms three in a row two were va-
cant the door of the third was locked
heedless of danger the three men
braced their shoulders against it and
pushed mightily until it gave as they
rushed into the room they saw lying on
the bed the form of sato nagati ap-
parently asleep despite the hubbub of
the search

  sprague pointed his gun at the japs
heart grab him men he com-
manded ive got him covered

  brady and harding rushed at the
sleeping figure they extended their
hands ready to grasp the yellow fiend
the unknown revolution



  and then even as they were about
to seize him a ghastly fear came upon
them as a hollow laugh rang out-the
laugh of sato-and the figure melted
into nothingness before their eyes

chapter xvi

the course of true love

e trio stared at the bed whereon
but a moment before a human
form had been lying apparently in deep
slumber then it flashed upon sprague
that they had seen the astral figure of
sato only but so perfectly reproduced
and so apparently substantial that it
had seemed actually human the hoax
was the more readily perpetrated be-
cause of their haste were they
trapped sprague scented danger

  out with you  he bawled warn
the men downstairs

  harding and brady precipitately fled
yelling a warning as they descended the
stairs sprague was last to leave at
the door of the room he turned and
glanced back standing in the center
of it regarding him with a smile of
malevolent triumph stood sato nagati

  raging fearless heedless of his own
caution to the others sprague rushed
back toward the jap only to see the
form dissolve and disappear to the ac-
companiment of a mocking laugh

  in sudden panic sprague fearing he
knew not what dashed for the door
and down the stairs to the main hall
he could hear scurrying feet below
rushing from the building in mad
haste he dashed for the exit and arrived
safely on the veranda-just in time

  an explosion which shook the house
roared above him sticks and plaster
and other debris filled the air for a
thrilling second then descended in a
dangerous downpour the outer walls
held against the blast however and
no one was injured

  the street rapidly filled with af-
frighted people who were pressed

backward by the twenty policemen
leaving them in charge sprague
harding and brady exerted all their
concentrated powers to discover satos
whereabouts but to no avail

  that devil set a time bomb for us
growled sprague

  and we walked into his trap like
blind men sighed brady

  but out of it-in time sprague re-
minded them were three lucky
men

  they went to hardings hotel to dis-
cuss plans as they entered the lobby
sprague gave a glad cry and rushed
ahead harding and brady stared
amazed

  dolores perez was rising from a
rocker eyes aglow and hands out-
stretched to sprague as harding and
brady came up they heard sprague say-
ing but i thought you were to stay
in nogales

  dolores flashed a welcome smile at
the newcomers recognizing brady as
the man who had rescued her from
tono yati harding she had not yet
met so brady presented him both men
speaking mexican

  i was worried she told them i
had no word from senor sprague and
besides the general at nogales heard of
new raids to be made and warned me
to return to my uncle in mexico city
so i came here

  and now said sprague youre in
worse danger

  dolores flushed and her eyes grew
radiant so are you in danger she
murmured then the spanish pride in
her asserted itself i have no fear

  but you dont know satos power
urged sprague

  harding noticed an angry gleam in
the girls eyes and thought sprague
rather tactless to speak thus in his first
meeting with dolores since her rescue
although he acknowledged that sprague
was right nevertheless dolores was


the unknown revolution

cut to the quick by what she consid-
ered a cool welcome

  are you afraid senor sprague
she asked icily although she unbent a
trifle when he fervently replied for
you only dolores

  then i am unwelcome i have be-
come a burden here she exclaimed
suddenly adios and before
spragues astoundment could resolve
itself into speech dolores had brushed
past the men and out of the hotel

  some spitfire exclaimed brady
reminds me of a little irish girl i
know no telling what a womanll do

  shell be all right later said hard-
ing patting spragues shoulder you
must have hurt her pride these mex-
icans are very touchy especially the
spanish type

  but sprague in the sudden doldrums
of a lover glowered without reply
the other two men wise in their gen-
eration forbore from offering any more
unwelcome comfort harding tactfully
quit smoking his atrocious pipe lest it
jar spragues already taut nerves while
brady mentally excoriated the girl for
thus sorely hurting his chief with one
of the unaccountable whims of a
woman

  upstairs in hardings room they dis-
cussed their narrow escape from the
infernal machine planted by sato na-
gati

  theres one thing weve neglected
to do said sprague after a long inter-
val of thought

  harding looked his interest while
brady pressed for an explanation

  we havent searched satos air-
plane said their leader lets do it-
now he rose eager to submerge his
heart hurt in the excitement of ferret-
ing out the japs secrets anything to
get away from the memory of dolores
unkind cut perhaps she might be
sorry now he thought bitterly and
might send a note calling him to her
again she had been unfair he told

himself inasmuch as he merely had
been solicitous for her safety not for
his own

  as he and his companions sauntered
forth and headed for the place where
satos airplane was concealed sprague
almost savagely muttered to himself
shes sorry now ill bet well let
her be sorry for a while itll do her
good

  but little did he dream in what peril
dolores was and how she bitterly was
regretting even at that moment her an-
gry heedlessness of his warning had
he but known-

chapter xvii

in satos snare

yyhen dolores perez head high
eyes staring straight ahead left
hardings hotel and the man she loved
a mexican idly sauntered past som-
brero pulled low over his eyes to shield
them from the suns glare the girl
passed him her heart sore at what she
deemed a cool reception from her fiance
sprague had not been so glad to see
her as he was anxious that she was in
danger dolores raged in her heart
his danger had brought her to mexico
city wittingly to face it with him and
he had twitted her for being foolhardy
and rushing into danger

  she bit her lips to restrain the sudden
tears which seemed to sear her eyes
she walked quickly at first then slack-
ened her pace in a wild hope that
sprague would run after her and ask
forgiveness but sprague did not fol-
low or if he did he had not seen fit
to overtake her and she was too proud
to glance backward to see if he were
dogging her steps

  consequently dolores did not see the
mexican in the low-drawn sombrero
following on her trail a yearning for
solitude came upon her-solitude in
which she could give vent to her self-
imposed grief for on calmer reflec-
the unknown revolution



tion dolores began to accuse herself
of having been overhasty ungenerous
and thankless toward the man who had
spoken with thought for her safety
only in this mood she directed her
steps toward a quiet many-bowered
square-one of the many abounding in
mexico city and similar to but less
frequented than washington square in
new york city here she sat on a
bench in an arbor and gave way to
tears sobbing hysterically in an after-
math of self-reproach for her hasty
temper and unreasoning pride the
first paroxysms over dolores began to
feel a benumbing influence acting upon
her mind she sought to shake it off
then chancing to glance toward a cor-
ner of the arbor her startled eyes be-
held behind the screen of leaves the
yellow face of a japanese beneath a
mexican sombrero his eyes boring deep
into hers

  she tried to scream in fright but
found herself deprived of volition as
the hypnotic influence of sato nagatis
black eyes cast their unholy spell upon
her to do his will even when he
emerged from his hiding place and
stood before her dolores could not
move the jap made a few passes be-
fore her eyes

  you will stay here five minutes
he said commandingly i shall return
you will go off with me you will
enter an auto which i will drive you
will make no outcry

  she sat unmoved staring straight
ahead with the fixed look of the hyp-
notized the jap turned and walked
hurriedly out into the square five
minutes later he returned and touched
the girls shoulder obedient to his
will dolores rose guided in her actions
by his mesmeric influence he led her
to the curb assisted her into the closed
curtained tonneau of a touring car took
his place at the wheel and sped off
toward the southwestern section of
mexico city

chapter xviii

a duel of souls

a ll unwitting of the new abduction
which had placed dolores again
in the power of sato nagati sprague
led harding and brady to the wood
where off the southwest road the air-
plane of the jap was concealed the
machine was so cleverly camouflaged
and screened under heavily leafed
branches that even harding found it
difficult to discover sprague and
brady beguiled themselves by permit-
ting him to hunt for the plane finally
harding gave up and the other two
men led him to the copse where they
had concealed the machine so skill-
fully had they screened it that harding
hardly believed it possible a plane was
concealed therein until sprague pulled
away some of the branches and revealed
a wing of the aero

  it was a matter of a few moments
to uncover it and lift it clear the
machine was light enough for two men
to carry it for three men it was an
easy burden they carried it to a clear-
ing and began a systematic search of
the fuselage and machinery for any
papers the jap might have concealed
but for all their search they found
nothing to incriminate sato until
sprague by a sudden inspiration be-
thought himself of examining the pad-
ding beneath the leather surface of the
seats

  acting on the inspiration he pro-
duced a knife and cut a slit in each
seat inserting his hand in the first
cushion he could find nothing but
the second seat amply rewarded his
search his fingers fumbling in the
padding and among the springs clasped
a packet of papers with a cry of tri-
umph he pulled it forth and held it
high

  eureka he cried this is why
sato was so anxious about his plane

ill bet


the unknown revolution

  some of the papers proved to be
written in japanese but most were in
mexican which all three men could
read

  heres evidence of a plot against the
united states commented sprague
after carefully examining one lot
and heres a complete roster of the
rebel chiefs involved in the move on
mexico city he began to read off
the names then desisted ill place
this evidence before the president he
said then as he examined more
closely he exclaimed well outwit
them now heres the full detail of
the forces coming against us-so many
men to the south so many to the north
so many to the east and so many to
the west with this information the
administration can distribute its forces
to combat the rebels and defeat them
no time is to be lost brady you take
the papers relating to the plot against
the united states and fly this plane
to nogales deliver the papers to the
general there with orders to forward
them by plane to washington then
hustle back here go

  brady entered the machine enough
of a clearing was available for a rise
he started the engine waving to his
comrades then with a graceful
swoop he soared up-up-up-and
sped northeast toward nogales

  harding and sprague the precious
papers informing them of the revolu-
tionary movements in their possession
hastened toward the road and walked
swiftly into the city

  higher and higher soared brady
they saw his machine heading off but
little dreamed that sato also just
emerging from an adobe hut wherein
he had imprisoned dolores also saw
the precious plane dashing away with
its incriminating evidence against his
activities in japans behalf

  with a snarl of rage sato concen-
trated every energy on the task he had
set for himself and projected his as-

tral body directly upward and into the
fuselage of bradys machine brady
intent on his task of speeding off was
startled at the yellow apparition which
interposed between him and space
ahead the grinning face malevolent
eyes and spectral hands extended to-
ward him almost unnerved him but
he gritted his teeth and with a prayer
that he might forfend this dread vis-
itor he likewise projected his astral
body full against satos gripping with
spectral arms the equally phantom form
of his enemy

  exactly as in the dances the three
americans had practiced brady swayed
the form of sato aside so his vision
ahead could not be disturbed and in
this wise using occult defense against
occult attack he sped on-on-on-
until satos power of projection became
more and more feeble with distance
and finally his astral body disappeared

  then nearly exhausted at the double
task he had been compelled to perform
brady withdrew his astral body and
descended for a few moments respite
refreshed he soared aloft again and
successfully completed his flight to
nogales delivered the papers saw them
relayed by aero to washington and
then refilled his tanks with gasoline for
the return trip to mexico city

chapter xix

the threat of sato nagati

a rrived at the administration
palace harding and sprague
were granted immediate audience with
the president they placed before him
the details of satos conspiracy and as-
sisted him in plans to circumvent the
attack upon the capital by the bandit
forces

  instead of waiting to be attacked the
loyal troops were led against the ad-
vancing foes of the administration
with their battles and the day-after-
the unknown revolution



day drives that followed the successful
defeat of satos plot this tale has no
connection save as a sidelight on the
ultimate ruse practiced by general
gonzales which led to the death of
zapata and the later campaign which
seems at this writing to spell the doom
of the revolutionaries in the stricken
republic to the south of the united
states suffice it to say that the vic-
tory which would have been the fruition
of satos plot but for the discovery of
his papers in the airplane was turned
into utter rout and that villa blanquet
and the other forces loyal to the mem-
ories of diaz madero and huerta were
driven back into mountain fastnesses
whence they continue their desultory
and ineffectual raids both against the
mexican loyalists and against the
american border states

  but before this outcome sato na-
gati tried to forfend defeat of his plans
by playing his last trump when
brady successfully overcame his astral
effort to unnerve him sato turned his
attention to the remaining two sprague
and harding he had been amazed to
find brady alive and the discovery
added to his fear of the americans and
their power having failed in his mis-
sion and knowing that he could not
return to his emperor with failure writ
upon his record sato decided upon a
vengeance befitting a samurai this
achieved he would end his worthless
life by hara-kiri

  first however he must undo so
much as possible the hurt to his nation
by the discovery of those incriminating
papers so sato sent a telepathic flash
to sprague

  restore my papers he told the
american and senorita dolores goes
unharmed she is in my power re-
fuse-and she dies

  sprague received the message in a
moment when he was not guarding him-
self from mental intrusion on the part
of the jap the message alarmed him

at first and he discussed it with hard-
ing

  i dont believe it said harding
lets ask the secretary

  they telephoned the secretary of
state inquiring for dolores they
were informed that dolores had not
yet returned from a visit she had in-
tended to make to them at hardings
hotel this news hours after dolores
had gone nearly crazed sprague its
true its true he raved clutching
hardings shoulder so hard that the
other winced that fiend has her in
his power he wrants his papers-or
her life

  harding white-faced with horror
could offer no hope theyknew sato
would not hesitate at the most inhuman
cruelties and in despair they sent tel-
epathic flashes to locate him and reply
to his demands sato evidently ex-
pected this and had left his mind open
to receive their answer to his ulti-
matum

  sprague said harding i feel
satos mind receiving my flashes what
shall i tell him

   tell him well return the papers
harding stared in amazement re-
turn the papers he cried

  yes-to-night anything to gain
time said sprague savagely tell
him pm recalling brady sato doesnt
know weve split the papers part for
america and part for mexico we
must fence for time if were going to
save dolores cant you see if that
fiend knows we havent got the papers
hell kill her without mercy

  harding nodded then he concen-
trated his mentality to reach sato and
soon got in touch with him well
return the papers sato he flashed if
you will tell us where senorita dolores
is

  satos mocking laugh greeted this
promise papers first came his re-
ply girl afterward and deliver
papers right away or she dies
o

the unknown revolution

  but weve got to wait for brady
to return with them sped hardings
reply sprague is flashing brady now
to come back

  how long came satos demand
rather doubtfully

  as long as it has taken him to go
it must take so long to return an-
swered harding say four hours
from now

  where shall we meet asked sato
and will you pledge my safety
we pledge nothing it is for you
to guard yourself went the ameri-
cans reply and if dolores is hurt
you shall die

  another laugh greeted this sally a
laugh which made hardings blood run
cold pledge my safety insisted
sato and i deliver the girl for the
papers

  harding communed with sprague
promise his safety said the lover
wretchedly

  harding flashed the pledge to sato
who replied it is well meet me
four hours hence at the beginning of
the southwest road out of mexico city
the girl shall be near by ready to be
delivered to you but if you fail to
bring the papers and try any treachery
she dies

  knowing it to be impossible for them
to deliver the papers but trusting to
providence to thwart the dastardly
plans of the jap harding nevertheless
promised and the telepathic communi-
cations ceased

  we must find dolores said
sprague decisively when sato
learns we havent got the papers hell
slay her as sure as my name is walter
sprague

  well we have four hours grace
said harding slowly it isnt much
but its something lets flash for her
better still suggested sprague
lets go toward the southwest road
and try astral projection of our eyes
to see if we can locate her in any of

the houses there or just outside the

city

  accordingly the two men set out on
their strange mission using every iota
of their wonderful telepathic and astral
power to reach the mind of dolores
perez but all their efforts were un-
availing two hours after their -start
on this mission they were as far at
sea as at the beginning they now
were nearing the southwest road here
houses were less frequent and they
made more speed in their search but
seek as they would they could find no
trace of the girl they sought

  maybe that devil put us on the
wrong track said sprague hopelessly
maybe he has her at the other end
of town and would bring her here in
an auto from there

  well try a little while longer here
said harding we have three-quar-
ters of an hour yet

 i wonder if sato knows were
here 

  hardly unless he has seen us ive
kept my mind a blank to him although
ive felt his mental probing

  so have i said sprague but i
made him think i was flashing brady
to return

  they hurried along searching with
astral vision every house along the
road finally they came to a stretch
where no houses were in sight star-
ing down the road sprague shook his
head with a hopeless look in his eyes

  no use he said dolorously we
might as well turn back harding
they faced about and retraced their
steps both weary and heart-hungry
full of the despair of the defeated
sato held the whiphand and they must
bare themselves to his lashing do-
lores fate seemed sealed unless by
some means they could lay hands on
the yellow man who held her in his
power

fifteen minutes were left them of
the precious four hours grace fifteen
the unknown revolution

i

minutes that raced all too quickly into
the eternity of things past sprague
hdd his watch in a feverishly nervous
hand watching the second hand telling
off the spaces on its dial with each
tick his heart seemed more leaden his
brain more benumbed under the weight
of impending loss and sorrow hard-
ing was walking gloomily along head
down but mind active

  ten minutes-left-and still no
hope five minutes-four-three
they were nearing the rendezvous ap-
pointed by sato would he keep the
appointment or was he aware of its
futility for himself the americans
asked themselves this question a hun-
dred times as they drew nearer and
nearer the meeting place

  sato was not in sight sprague and
harding began to yield to despair
then when their hopes seemed doomed
entirely an auto appeared speeding to-
ward them from the city part of the
thoroughfare they were plodding

  and at the wheel sat-not sato but
dolores perez

chapter xx

satos ruse

yyith a glad cry of relief and love
and happiness all combined in
one sprague sprang directly in the
autos path as dolores shut off gas and
applied brakes harding stared in
amazement at this sudden apparition
of the girl for whom they had made
such an unavailing search but he
too was immensely relieved and has-
tened to express his delight

  sprague went to the side of the ma-
chine and held out his arms hoping she
would yield to his embrace but she
merely stared at him with unseeing eyes
and repeated words which seemed to
have been dictated to her

  give me the papers came her
voice sounding strangely hollow sato
waits for me i must go the papers

  dolores listen exclaimed sprague
dont you know me wont you for-
give me for hurting you

  but the girl seemed to stare at him
and yet beyond him as though she did
not see him the papers she mur-
mured again i must return with
them my master waits

  well ill be-shot exclaimed
harding hypnotized

  the devil cried sprague suddenly
realizing the ingenious stratagem played
by sato but his ruse wont work
well save her from him he cant
stop us

  senorita doloresr said harding
do you know us

  the girl did not seem to hear con-
tinuing to stare straight ahead un-
blinking

  what can we do  whispered hard-
ing

  take the wheel from her and drive
home suggested sprague but hard-
ing frowned on this maybe sato can
kill her holding her in his power by
hypnotism he objected well have
to use some other means

  sprague saw the justice of hard-
ings stand satos power was not a
matter to deal with lightly probably
he was not far off watching this tab-
leau in the road and enjoying his ene-
mies discomfiture they knew they
could not break the hypnotic spell of
another person that it required the one
who hypnotized to release the one in
thrall this release must be either vol-
untary or brought about by the death
of the mesmerist

  the papers came the girls sing-
song voice where are they

  harding glanced at sprague it
hardly would do to voice the fact to
her lest it be repeated through her
to satos listening brain that the papers
were beyond their recovery they
must play for time for opportunity
do anything but let her know and so
inform sato


the unknown revolution

  sprague was about to reply when
harding made a sudden spring upon
the dashboard of the machine and
clasped the form of dolores tightly in

his arms

  the girls lips drew back from her
teeth in a rage sprague thought hard-
ing suddenly had gone mad and was
about to force him to unhand dolores
when harding hissed let go
sprague  help me 

  and then in a flash sprague under-
stood the one he had thought dolores
was not dolores but the arch-fiend
sato himself come thus attired and dis-
guised to befool them into a new trap

chapter xxi

turning the tables

ljardings movement had been so
sudden that he had caught sato
unawares yet he had found no mean
adversary this was no woman but
a man a powerful athlete a person of
steel sinews and lion strength he
gripped his arms together until it
seemed he must break satos ribs and
thus hauled him from the seat and to
the road handcuff his wrists and
ankles both panted harding he felt
the hot breath of the pseudo dolores
against his cheek then gave a snort of
pain and fury as the jap bit deep into
the flesh but he held on like grim
death standing in the road sprague
saw hardings bleeding cheek and a
sudden vindictive rage consumed him
but wish though he might to slay this
man in their power his one desire was
to take him alive so he restrained his
fury and withheld the smashing blow
he had intended to give the jap in-
stead he stooped to lock the prisoners
ankles in handcuffs even as he
stooped the jap kicked backward
viciously landing a heel on spragues
nose so that blood spurted from it
sprague reeled backward but rallied
and by a quick tackle wound a sturdy

arm around the calves of sato nagati
with his free hand he snapped irons
on the japs ankles it was done in
the twinkling of an eye-far less time
than it has taken to recount it and
satos shoes-those of a man-ex-
plained how harding had discovered
the japs nearly successful ruse

  sato was horrible to see never be-
fore had harding or sprague seen such
a look on the face of a man his
beady eyes were bulging lips livid
pared back from teeth tightly clenched
in rage and despair

  grasping one of the japs arms
which harding held tightly to satos
side sprague manacled it and swung
it behind the jap then harding still
holding the slender but wiry form in
his viselike grap sprague yanked the
japs other arm backward and fastened
the second wrist with the links of jus-
tice

  sato had ceased to struggle and on
his face had appeared a look of sullen
acceptance of his fate yet the gleam
in his eyes was murderous as he stared
at his captors they felt the power of
his mind upon theirs and knew he was
trying at close range to murder them
by sheer mental concentration they
shielded themselves from this venom-
ous attack however by their mystic
thought circle a nimbus as it were
of imagined space distance voids
depths so that it could not penetrate
to their consciousness

  they lifted sato into the machine
even as they did so the womans hat
and wig he had donned fell from satos
head disclosing the short crisp black
hair of his race sprague sprang into
the tonneau to stand guard and hard-
ing took the wheel in this wise they
entered the city sprague carefully
drawing the curtains so that no one
might discover the prisoner

  although sprague plied sato with
questions the jap answered never a
word the americans face was
the unknown revolution



smeared with blood from his nose but
he let it drip on his clothing unheed-
ing lest by distraction in wiping it away
sato might be able to turn some physi-
cal or occult trick against him or hard-
ing harding likewise bleeding from
the bite in his cheek gave the blood
no heed they traveled swiftly and
arrived at the headquarters of the de-
partment of justice here they alighted
and carried sato into the building

 whatever you do cautioned
sprague to the police official in charge
dont loose his bonds rather bind
him in ropes so he cant get free then
put a special guard over him while we
report to the president

  what is the charge  asked the
official

  murder in the first degree upon
the bodies of the council of nine said
sprague attempted murder of my-
self abduction of the senorita do-
lores perez niece of the secretary of
state plots against the mexican gov-
ernment to unite the bandits into a joint
attack on mexico city and obtain for
japan-a land cession in lower cali-
fornia and sonora you can see the
need for extreme care in holding the
prisoner he is too dangerous even in
handcuffs keep four men on constant
watch and under no circumstances per-
mit them to come under satos glance
for fear of hypnotism keep four
other men handy in case of emergency
for further precaution you might place
him in a strait-jacket-i understand
you have them here as well as we have
them in america-and place a lock on
it so no one can release him keep
the key yourself

  the senores had a hard time to over-
come him said the official glancing
at their bloodstained faces their stained
clothing

  somewhat grinned harding but
hell bite no more

  or kick growled sprague

  probably the senores need a doctor

suggested the official one is always
at hand here he tapped a bell a
gendarme appeared call doctor
mendoz he commanded

  a few moments later doctor mendoz
appeared he knew harding and
sprague and bowed after examin-
ing spragues nose he declared it had
been broken by satos kick youll be
all right in a few weeks though senor
he said setting himself skillfully to
the task of splinting spragues pro-
boscis tried to stop an auto it al-
most seems he smiled

  no a ladys slipper said sprague
facetiously glancing at the japs female
costume and mans shoes the doctor
grinned then the wound has been
heeled  he punned and theres no
need for my services eh 

  but sprague was so dumfounded by
this wit in a mexican that he effectually
was squelched doctor mendoz dressed
hardings wound and received that per-
sons grateful thanks for easing his
pain thus bandaged harding and
sprague went forth to notify the pres-
ident of their catch this done and
the president giving even stricter orders
for satos confinement the americans
went to their respective rooms to
change their bloody garments for others
before starting on the trail to find
dolores

  in satos papers had been found a
diary which a mexican who could con-
verse in and translate japanese had de-
ciphered in it was set forth in care-
fully couched words satos exploits in
mexico the record was addressed to
his imperial majesty the mikado of
japan and expressed a hope that his
heart would be gladdened to learn how
successfully his servant sato-un-
worthy of even the slightest reflex of
the glory of his emperors glance-had
won for the land of the rising sun
secrets of mighty power wherewith to
punish those mexicans who would
thwart japan in acquiring mexican


the unknown revolution

lands and those americans who denied
racial equality to japanese subjects
it set forth how sato had set the tiny
bomb of powdered poison in the bou-
quet on the table in the room of the
council of nine and had exploded it
when he learned they had refused to
sign the land cession how he had
fought the three american secret-serv-
ice men who werr on his trail how he
had plotted with the banditti to over-
whelm the administration and win from
the victors the cession denied by the
powers in control of mexico how he
had caused the death of senator
taguerrez by his power to mentally
paralyze his victim and other details
the diary ended with the prayer that
your majesty will not be provoked
at what little failures i have experi-
enced comparing them with successes
achieved and greater successes will
follow when the three americans meet
their doom through me

  the papers established a complete
case for the government but the
strictest censorship was cast about
them and this memoir is the first ink-
ling of the thwarting of a revolution
which threatened not alone mexico but
the entire american continent but the
papers could not be restrained from
publishing next day news of the death
of sato nagati in his cell he had
committed suicide by strangling himself
against the collar of his strait-jacket
harding and sprague could visualize
the stoic indifference with which the
samurai had exercised his iron will in
thus ending a life no longer useful to
japan and therefore no longer useful
to himself

  bradys return had been delayed by
motor trouble but he arrived before
noon and the three men joined forces
to seek dolores sprague and hard-
ing had been at the task all night and
were haggard from loss of sleep and
anxiety but their joy at ending the
menace of satos influence was un-

bounded and brady joined them in
their jubilation he told how he had
been menaced by satos astral form
and how he had overcome it

  nearly unnerved me though when
i saw his eyes glaring at me up in the
clouds he said

  well hes dead now said sprague
and heres an item in the paper may
interest you brady he handed
brady the mexican paper in which a
cabled communication from the japa-
nese government made a complete dis-
avowal of the actions of sato and dis-
claimed any responsibility on the part
of the mikado or the land of the rising
sun for satos conspiracy

  all the same ill bet he was one
of a band pledged to do service for
their country even at the expense of
their lives but without open official
sanction from their government said
brady ill bet that if he had gotten
away with this game he would have
been richly rewarded for it

 the papers we found show sato
was none other than yamati yotori
of the ancient samurai family of shan
otoy and that he was one of the most
eminent japanese psychologists ever
known we certainly were lucky to
bring about his destruction said
sprague

  theres americas real peril said
harding the occult powers possessed
by the japanese and their methods
he added vindictively as he smoothed
his cheek with a grimace of pain

  and now boys said sprague ris-
ing we must find dolores before it
is too late

  too late echoed the others
yes she might be starving to death
while we sit and talk doing nothing
theres only one way said hard-
ing or well be too late

 and that- questioned sprague

  comb the city as we did hunting
for sato-each-take a section and work
the unknown revolution



our tclepathic powers in the same criss-
cross manner

chapter xxii
loves reward

thls course decided on the trio
went about their task with fever-
ish energy no time was to be lost
if they were to rescue dolores before
she starved to death satos death had
freed her from hypnotic influence and
she could respond to their telepathic
questioning force should they encounter
her mind waves sprague took the
eastern end of the city harding the
western and brady the northern
they converged exactly as they had in
the case of sato but so far their men-
talities had not located dolores

  can it be possible sato took her
out of the city groaned sprague as
the three met

  we havent combed the southern
section yet comforted harding his
heart going out to his chief whose face
behind the bandages was pallid eyes
gloomy with foreboding

  lets hurry added brady

  so they set off again each at a point
where his mental forces would cooper-
ate with the other two in the weird
search but dolores apparently was
not in ihe city or if she were she
must be beyond their powers dead
groaned sprague in his heart

  we can try the southwest road
again quoth harding

  useless said sprague but hoping
against hope nevertheless

  why useless asked brady she
was under hypnotic influence when you
tried before now you know sprague
even our powers cannot reach one in
hypnotic state lets try-just to make
sure

  she may respond now said hard-
ing being free from mesmerism she
will respond

  and so they started again little hope

in their hearts however to find do-
lores it was sprague whose mind first
came into contact with hers wildly
happy he flashed the gladsome news
to harding and brady and the trio
gathered together

  shes in that hut-there-just off
the road said sprague excitedly
pointing to a hut scarce discernible now
in the dusk which had fallen i got
just the faintest response but was able
to locate her

  the men strode toward the hut but
brady offered a word of caution you
know what sato was he said sup-
pose hes left a trap here for us to
tread into

  right said sprague well in-
vestigate or rather i shall

  he stood in an attitude tense with
anxiety as he projected his astral eyes
toward the hut searching the ground
for evidences of some mine which
might be exploded by an unwary step
then he sent his vision into the cabin
what he saw started him on a run
toward the place heedless of pitfalls
eager only to be in time as he ran
his hand went to his hip

  harding and brady hurried after
him just in time to see sprague hurtle
his body against the door of the hut
and vanish in its interior

  then came the crash of a shot a
womans scream and-silence

  rushing through the door harding
and brady saw a strange tableau
sprague was holding dolores in his
arms tenderly kissing her right wrist
from which blood was flowing freely
the girl was unconscious the light was
barely sufficient for them to grasp these
details as sprague turned toward them

  brady came his voice strangely
weak hurry for an auto i had to
shoot her

  shoot her cried both men in
amazement

  yes tell you later hurry for the
auto said sprague then fell uncon-


the unknown revolution

scious overwrought by this strange
ending to the chase and his exhaustion
in pursuing it to its close

  harding it was whose arms received
the collapsing form of his chief easing
it to the ground where still holding
dolores in embrace sprague lay for
many minutes while brady sped off
to get a vehicle

  sprague yielded to hardings minis-
trations however in the end and
opened his eyes

  dolores he murmured i didnt
mean to hurt you-but i had to do it
then as he recognized harding
sprague sat up tenderly removing his
arm from beneath dolores a close
call harding he said i was all
in afterward

  guess you were sprague said
harding you went out like a can-
dle

  loss of sleep-excitement-and the
tragedy of having to shoot her mut-
tered sprague heavens harding
but it was awful if i had been a mo-
ment later-

  what asked the other

  dolores would have been dead

  dead

  yes that fiend sato had left in
this hut a vial like the one he left me
when he had me in his dungeon ex-
plained sprague when i projected
my astral eyes inside this room i saw
dolores emaciated with hunger-as
you see her-raising the vial to her
lips to drink probably inspired by some
posthumous influence of satos mind

  he shuddered and harding inter-
posed the devil

  yes said sprague he was a devil
if ever one existed in human form
that vial held death i couldnt reach
her side in time to knock it from her
hand so i took the only course to save
her

  harding nodded understanding the
dread that must have filled spragues

heart as he leveled his weapon at the
woman he loved and shot her lest she
die of poison

  i shot her said sprague sadly
and id rather have put a bullet in my
heart than do it but there was no
other way

  he lifted dolores wrist to his lips
kissing the wound and heedless of the
blood that left its crimson traces on his
face the girl stirred

  outside sounded the chug-chug of
bradys auto speeding toward them on
the road harding went to the door
and hallooed bradys auto lights
flashed in his direction

  some of its radiant glare fell upon
the two within the hut dolores opened
her eyes above her was the bandaged
face of her lover he was kissing her
wrist but it seemed that his kisses
burned-pained her then she swooned
again as sprague exerting his strength
to the utmost what was left of it after
all his toil and sleepless anxiety lifted
her in his arms and staggered to the
threshold

  brady came forward from the road
a black figure in the bright glare of
the headlights ive brought some
brandy sprague arid youd better take
some he offered the flask to his
chief but sprague would not relin-
quish this opportunity to hold in his
arms the woman he loved harding
took the flask and held it to spragues
lips but sprague growled savagely
dolores first then thinking of her
wound and its danger of infection he
directed harding to lave it with the
brandy

  harding soaked a handkerchief with
the fiery liquor and applied it to the
injured wrist of the girl with another
handkerchief he wiped the blood from
spragues face the sting of the
brandy on her raw wound roused do-
lores to wakefulness and with wake-
fulness came also the agony of her hurt
so that she groaned
the unknown revolution



  dolores sprague pleaded bro-
kenly can you ever forgive me
forgive she murmured for
what 

  for shooting you he moaned

  is that what pains me she asked

  yes i had to do it-

  i know walter she murmured
  and youre not angry

  angry i think it was the bravest
thing in the world-to shoot at one you
loved-to save her life i was goaded
to take the poison walter-goaded by
the mind of sato even mention of
his name made her shiver

  i knew the flask was like the one he
left me in my dungeon when i was
in his power said sprague but
thats a long story and i shall have to
tell you of it later

  where is sato now she asked
dead he will trouble you no
more

  dolores shuddered and to think
walter that i-i-almost hated you
for warning me against him she said
chokingly

  i knew he was dangerous said
sprague

  it seemed to me that you didnt
want me to share your danger-as
though i were in your way or that i

wasnt wanted-as though-

  but you know better now dolores
he exclaimed earnestly

 yes-

  and that i feared for your safety
harding and brady were moving
away this communion of lovers was
not for their ears

  sprague repeated his question when
dolores did not reply

  but i also feared for your safety
she exclaimed and it seemed so cool
of you to disregard the-the-

  the what dolores

   the love that prompted me to share
danger with you she murmured
against his shoulder we of spanish
blood are more demonstrative though
i guess

   sprague felt the warm blood tingling
in his cheeks was he a cool lover
he asked himself miserably what
could he say to please her he was
no gallant of olden days but a prosaic
matter-of-fact decent american lover
yet he would have given worlds for
the smooth suavity of an accomplished
squire of dames as it was he said-
nothing but his embrace grew tighter
than was necessary for the mere hold-
ing of her in his arms and from some-
where against his coat came a dulcet
murmur walter

  yes dolores murmured sprague
ear inclined to her lips

  do you-can you-love me-after
-after all the hurt i did to you came
the girls whisper tremulous as a
zephyrs plea for the kiss of a flower

  sprague glanced toward his com-
panions in this adventure they were
stepping into the machine but the glare
of its headlights was full in his eyes
the girl in his arms quivered-or was
he the one who was quivering with the
wonderful ecstasy of this witching
hour it seemed an aeon that he paused
thus although in actual time it was the
fraction of a second the flicker of an
eyelash

  and then conspicuous though they
might be in the auto headlights glare
sprague tossed aside all thought of con-
ventionalities and eyes shining with the
joy of loves fulfillment he gave an-
swer to dolores question lip to lip
in the language that needs no words
and is most eloquent in its silence
the young man who had been
waiting with constant nervous
glances at the door sprang up
with relieved alacrity to answer the
bell he was a fair sensitive-looking
youth not more than twenty-three or
four and hardly looking his age he
was carefully even a trifle foppishly
dressed with a fresh band of black
on the sleeve of his gray coat

  awfully good of you to come he
said uttering the meaningless formal-
ity in a pleasant but rather characterless
voice queer sort of arrangement
very tersely agreed the man he
had just greeted entering and remov-
ing his shabby hat and coat he was
a marked contrast to his host being
close to forty unusually dark of skin
and hair with a heavily lined stem
face and curiously light-colored eyes
which he kept half closed he did not
look amiable and the young man who
had admitted him seemed to shrink
from his grim and unresponsive de-
meanor

  i suppose said the older man that
our letters are in effect about the
same we might compare them
though

  he took an envelope from his pocket
and after a moment of nervous hesita-
tion the young fellow did the same
they first compared the envelopes
which were both addressed in the same
old-fashioned spidery handwriting-
one to cyril norton the other to
ashton ware

  your uncle was such an up-to-date
man said ashton ware the visitor
that his writing always surprised me
it is of the old school

 but surely he was of the old
school exclaimed cyril i never saw
him without imagining what he would
look like in the clothes of another day
and generation

  he of the old school ashton
ware laughed harshly my dear mr
norton get that idea out of your head
his was the most modem progressive
personality i have known in years he
when dead lips speak



led the extremists when it came to
daring theories and problems-scien-
tific or metaphysical or--as is so often
the case-both surely you never
thought of your late uncle as old-fash-
ioned 

  i-i never thought of him in any
other way particularly said cyril
looking perplexed he never did any-
thing particularly modern that i know
of except buy an automobile and a
phonograph he was fond of the pho-
nograph always kept it in his bed-
room ware smiled a grim mirthless
smile

  and you never heard of his re-
search and experimental work in psy-
chology 

 psychology uncle adam im-
possible 

  cyril appeared to grow slightly paler
and drew back a step

  it seems incredible he cxclaimed
in his colorless voice my uncle al-
ways seemed a quiet rather moody old
man given over to his love for books
i didnt know that he had any -interest
in life keener than what he felt for a
genuine first edition

  there was the faintest note of bitter-
ness in his voice and ashton ware
flashed him a quick glance out of those
odd penetrating light eyes of his

  you arid the late mr adam norton
-your uncle-were not altogether con-
genial i believe

  cyril colored as he answered hastily
malicious persons have circulated that

rumor-

  but doesnt it happen to be a true
rumor persisted the other seeming to
take a malignant satisfaction in the
young mans obvious annoyance and
embarrassment you wanted to be an
actor i think

cyril norton shrugged his shoulders
we got along together as well as most
uncles and nephews i fancy he said
speaking as composedly and naturally
atb

as he could he did not care about
the stage and-well it couldnt be ex-
pected that we should have the same
tastes with a difference of half a cen-
tury between us but we seldom quar-
reled

  and yet said ashton ware tap-
ping the letter he held he expected you
to murder him

  he seemed to think it quite as likely
that you would responded cyril
quickly with a certain veiled intona-
tion that suggested he didnt think that
proposition altogether improbable him-
self ware could hardly fail to read
the significance of the tone and a flicker
of resentment showed in his pale eyes
for a moment then passed under what
was evidently a superbly developed
power of self-control

  you have a comfortable place here
he said abruptly looking about him at
the rich heavy furniture and old oil
paintings the nortons lived in one
of the largest apartments in the city
and though the house was modern
the flat itself was as like a piece taken
whole out of an older and less garish
day as any flat could be but cyril
was staring at the two envelopes and
did not answer so the older man said
bluntly almost brutally

  lets get done with it read yours
first aloud-or stay we will read each
others aloud

  cyril agreed they exchanged en-
velopes and ware read from the letter
addressed to the young man

  my dear cyril i have reason to be-
lieve that ashton ware will try to murder
me if i should die suddenly i wish you
to summon him here and place him under
any and all tests in your power remember
you will also have to prove that you yourself
did not commit the crime as you have both
incentive and opportunity above all i wish
you both to submit to the test of the voca-
morta the directions for using which are ap-
pended below your uncle

adam norton

  cyril looked at him blankly the
so

when dead lips speak

vocamorta he repeated what did
he mean 

  one of his inventions doubtless
said ware during the far too brief
period when i went to school i think
i learned that voca meant voice and
morta death therefore this means
literally the voice of death or voice
of the dead am i right about that
your uncle sent you through college i
believe and you should know

  cyril recoiled and spoke with a vis-
ible effort yes-yes of course
vocamorta-the voice of the dead
what a horrible thought shall i read
aloud his letter to you  it is practi-
cally the same as mine only a good
deal longer and more detailed

  my deak ware i believe my grand-
nephew may wish to kilt me and do not think
it entirely improbable that you may do the
same if you hear of my sudden death come
at once to my residence and there confront
cyril you will find by my will that each
of you will have have the strongest possible
inducement to cast suspicion on the other
i have invented a wonderful and delicate in-
strument the vocamorta which i believe
will testify truthfully to my murderers
identity i have long believed in common
with many eminent spiritists that the soul
after leaving the body especially abruptly
or violently lingers close to its late mor-
tal casing it has been photographed it
will some day be really seen there is no
reason why it should not be heard it merely
requires some delicate medium adjusted like
let us say the nerves of the spirit to bridge
the brief chasm and permit the dead to
speak-at least for a little while such an
instrument i have i believe perfected and
if it should be tested successfully over my
dead lips i shall not have died in vain

adam norton

  cyril had read the last part of the
letter with a frown of increasing be-
wilderment but he seemed to brush
it aside with a little characteristic
half-affected gesture he had and
added there are some directions be-
low like the other it all seems quite
mad to me

  ashton ware shrugged his shoulders
when did your uncle die mr nor-

ton  he brusquely demanded as if tired

of wasting time

  as i told you over the telephone
said young norton i went into his
room not five hours ago-that is about
four this afternoon-to find him cold
and lifeless i sent for the doctor im-
mediately and heard my fears only too
sadly confirmed then as judson his
old valet gave me his letter i tele-
phoned you without delay

  the caller smiled bitterly he and
judson had had more than one inter-
view and he did not like him in-
deed he detested that type of old
senile family servant slavishly devoted
to their masters interests regarding all
strangers askance even as he thought
thus resentfully a timid knock sounded
on one of the inner doors of the apart-
ment and judson himself stood before
them-a little bent old man with a
scanty fringe of white hair and the
perennially anxious yet self-effacing
look of one to whom life has been all
and only service

  i beg pardon mr cyril he said
in a thin voice but you said i was
to be a witness or something me and
the maids sir

  quite so judson cyril norton an-
swered kindly i particularly want
you to be present when i open my
uncles will which his lawyer sent to
me sealed an hour ago

  i know all about the will sir jud-
son said in his melancholy diffident
way i witnessed it-me and cook
really cyril knitted his brows
thats odd isnt it he appealed
to ware beneficiaries cant witness
wills yet id have sworn uncle adam
had made some provision for judson
here

  oh sir- deprecated judson

  ware broke in harshly men con-
fronted with death are often apt to
forget the smaller considerations of life
and to remember only one great obli-
gation-or one great revenge- he
when dead lips speak

i

broke off oddly disconcerted for cyril
was looking at him with a more inscru-
table expression than he would have
expected in that shallow and transpar-
ent young person

  you are taking it for granted the
latter said quietly that uncle adam
really knew he was confronted by
death 

  his letter sounds like it doesnt it
responded ware with an insolent in-
flection

  judson put in his piping voice not
exactly eagerly but as though impelled
by something utterly irrepressible
and there was his heart too you
know mr cyril you know as well
as i sir that the doctor told him a
year ago he might go off at any mo-
ment and must on no account get ex-
cited-

  that will do said cyril quickly
with a heightened color call in the
maids and we will read the will at
once

  they were just outside the door the
stout cook and the two maids and were
inside it in a second very much awed
and enormously interested

  then cyril broke the seal of the
long legal envelope and read the doc-
ument it contained

  the will which was as brief as legal
formality would permit left his worldly
goods to be divided equally between
cyril norton and ashton ware

  cyril cried out astounded as he
glanced over it then steadying his
voice read it aloud to murmurs of sur-
prise from the servants just at the
end he came upon a clause in which old
mr norton stipulated that if suspi-
cion of a criminal character were in
any manner thrown upon either of the
legatees the other was to inherit the
whole fortune outright

  ashton ware smiled cynically he
knew a lot about that will what a
weak spineless fool the boy was any-
how  the plan would be sure to work

with him he seemed almost like a
woman ready for hysterics and any
sort of absurdity

  well said the young man steady-
ing his voice the first thing to do
of course is to follow those very strange
directions of my uncles i-i simply
cant understand them i think he must
have been not quite right in his head
i knew he had a laboratory but really
i hardly knew of his going into it for
years did you judson

  oh yes sir said the old fellow
promptly but mournfully he used
to work there at night with wires and

batteries and things-

  and did you ever know of this-
this vocamorta  exclaimed cyril

  i know there was such a thing sir
yes the vockymotta thats what it
was he said the dead could speak
through it but i never heard it work-
ing mr cyril

  the young man shuddered god
forbid he muttered what a ghastly
invention-even in theory for of
course it is entirely impossible
why suddenly and rather unex-
pectedly demanded ashton ware
there has been spirit photography
very difficult indeed to explain

  you believe in this-vocamorta
ejaculated cyril incredulously

  ware again shrugged his shoulders
i believe in giving it a trial-in
the presence of these witnesses was
all he said

  i believe in carrying out my great-
uncles wishes to the letter cyril
norton rejoined rather curtly come
with me to my uncles room if you
please-all of you

  he entered first and paused a mo-
ment on the threshold his head bowed
reverently old judson wiped his eyes
on his respectable black sleeve and one
of the maids shivered

  please come in said young norton
quietly all of you he repeated

  the bedroom was a fairly large one


when dead lips speak

for an apartment and furnished in the
somewhat heavy somber taste of an
old-fashioned old man there were
two incongruous notes one the phono-
graph modem and shining and cold of
look in a comer the other the glimpse
through another open door of a small
laboratory

  you have been here before  cyril
asked ware i have not seen you

  often he replied laconically
while you were off with your actor
friends

  ashton ware and judson entered the
death chamber but the three women
stayed by the door not that they
minded a corpse you understand but
all this talk of the dead speaking which
they had heard through the library
door had made them more than a little
uneasy they huddled together ready
for flight but determined to stay

  the figure on the bed lay very
straight and stiff covered face and
all with a sheet

  the directions said ashton ware
speaking in his naturally unpleasant
voice with no pretense at lowering it
are to bring in the vocamorta from
the laboratory and place it in position
its electric battery turned on the small
silver disk hanging half an inch above
the lips of-of-

  even he faltered a bit just there
cyril winced outright

  shall-shall i bring it mr cyril
asked judson in a small and nervous
voice

  you know which it is

  oh yes sir i-pm sort of afraid
of it sir begging your pardon

  he really was afraid poor little old
man like many very gentle diffident
subservient souls judson was at heart
far from being a coward but he had
a deep and abiding fear of the voca-
morta his dread of it amounted al-
most to an obsession

  nevertheless he carried the instru-
ment a delicately complicated mech-

anism with two long wires supporting
a tiny gleaming circle of metal which
hung like a miniature silver lily pad
and trembled at the slightest touch

  very gently cyril turned the edge
of the sheet back fiom the still face
it was fragile and finely cut crowned
with hair like snow it looked peace-
ful as though adam norton were in-
deed not dead but sleeping

  cyril consulted his own letter

  our directions seem to be the
same he said in a low grave tone

the disk- he lowered the wires

so that the little circle of silver gleamed
above the pale face and now-the
electric lights out for-somebody count
please i-im too nervous-for two
minutes

  old judson still a little shaky pulled
himself together ill count sir he
said its the last thing i can do for
my old master

  ware turned the electric switch
which flung the room into complete
darkness and immediately cyril turned
on the small battery beside the death-
bed and the air was full of the whine
and whir of imprisoned electricity try-
ing to break free the women mur-
mured hail marys and were more
than ever inclined to flee when a tiny
blue gleam the merest pinpoint of light
appeared playing about the disk a deli-
cate mysterious spirit thing dancing
almost on the very face of death

  judson was counting slowly and reg-
ularly though in a very weak and trem-
ulous voice the room was in utter
darkness save for that pricking glint-
ing speck of light but there were
sounds sounds other than that of the
tiny dynamo-strange scarcely audible
sounds-footfalls and then a queer
harsh voice-the voice of adam nor-
ton who lay dead-crying cyril

  almost immediately it stopped and
then it came again and now theyjxmld
actually see the pale lips just lighted
by the blue flame moving as adam
when dead lips speak



norton unmistakably said cyril-
this man this ware-is a blackmailer
-a scoundrel-

  ware uttered a hoarse cry and

checked it judson had reached ninety-

eight in his counting the voice went

on you have murdered me finally
    tt

  one hundred and seven said jud-
son with chattering teeth one of the
girls began to cry

  the ginger-you poisoned-i-

oh heaven help me-my heart-i am
dying i cant go on-i-

  the voice broke off and cyril quickly
turned up the lights as judson reached
the hundred and twenty that made up
the two minutes specified in the dead
mans directions then he discon-
nected the battery

  the room was intolerably still jud-
son wiped the cold sweat from his fore-
head cyril carefully covered the still
face removing the electric apparatus
to make room for the sheet then he
turned to the man the voice of the dead
had accused

  well  he asked simply

  ware suddenly gasped wildly and
flung out his hands in a queer con-
vulsive way like a man drowning or
suffocating

  that was not the record were
the words he uttered in a sort of
hoarse almost voiceless scream that
was not the rec- the strident tor-
tured tones died away he stood star-
ing a man of stone yet somehow giv-
ing the impression of overwhelming
horror

  not the record you put in the pho-
nograph  said cyril coolly im quite
aware of it i turned off your record
as soon as you started it it wasnt
a bad scheme though ware especially
after you had given him the poi-
soned chinese ginger which you knew
he was fond of i had no way of prov-
ing i hadnt bought it for him myself
-i often did and with your phono-

  graph record smuggled into the ma-
chine while the lights were down-
while that wouldnt have much actual
legal value-well witnesses and all it
would have put me in a pretty piclde
i congratulate you on your imagina-
tion 

  he looked surprisingly energetic and
capable all at once the other man
cursed himself for having so under-
rated his adversary he was still very
cold from shock and terror

  then you got him to make a rec-
ord for you to he said in an ugly
voice i might have known hed dou
ble cross me at the last it would have
been his idea of a joke

  quite so-a screaming jest al-
most as funny as your giving him the
ginger

  you cant prove there was anything
wrong with the ginger

  really oh i think so you know
-i really think so you are counting

- dont go any of you he added to

the servants who divided between ter-
ror and curiosity were now edging
away therell be more for you to
testify to he went to a carved old-
fashioned cabinet and took down a
blue jar of canton ginger from its
shelves you are counting he pro-
ceeded calmly on his having eaten
the few pieces of ginger at the top of
the jar naturally you would not have
poisoned it all in case of an investiga-
tion he would have been supposed
to have died of heart trouble entirely
simple

 then how-

  as you see cyril went on calmly
the jar has not even been unsealed i
intend to have it analyzed to-morrow
ware his face ashen and convulsed
started toward him but the effeminate-
looking man with the black band on
his sleeve had already exchanged the
ginger jar for a revolver all three
maids shrieked in unison but young
nortons steady tone brought instant


when dead lips speak

  cjuiet i wouldnt kick up a fuss
ware i really wouldnt he advised
almost gently things are compli-
cated enough without our getting into
a free fight you know we dont want
the police butting in do we

  suddenly a horrible gruesome
thought seemed to break in upon ash-
ton wares consciousness his strange
eyes dilated and he took a few slow
stiff steps backward

  of course your murdered him your-
self he said but how did you make
him talk into that phonograph 

  how did you demanded cyril
really it seems an odd thing for a
man to arrange all the practical de-
tails of having himself murdered even
for the sake of getting a relative into
trouble

  it was- the words seemed to

choke him

  i know what it was ive heard
that precious record its a beauty

  just the same as-as-

  was what we heard to-night very
much the same with the substitution
for yours but however down on me
my great-uncle may have been i still
think he wouldnt have gone to the
trouble of dying in order to convict me
for his murder come now how

did you arrange it between you-

no no my friend nothing like that i
for ware had involuntarily started to-
ward the door dont forget i have
you covered and im rather good at
target shooting-at short range like
this speak up man or ill have you
arrested within five minutes

  but ware was not yet utterly cowed
 repeat my question if you please
he retorted how did you get him to
get that record he shrank a little
as he realized to what the emphasis
had committed him

  cyril turned to the servants judson
the cook and the two maids you
all heard that i think and can repeat
it-as he said it

  yes sir yes oh yes mr cy-
ril  oh the sneaking creature
such were a few of the immediate if
somewhat shaky responses but ware
would not give in yet i dont under-
stand-i dont understand he mut-
tered repeatedly then his pale eyes
grew suddenly wide

  if there was no other record in the
phonograph he said in a sharp stran-
gled tone what was it i heard
the voice of the dead said cyril
solemnly you knew of his investi-
gations in psychic matters and of his
invention of the vocamorta

  old judson faintly put in from the
doorway there was a vockymotta
sir-i know he used to work on it in
secret but i never knew it to work

before-

  then he is really-dead gasped
ware in choked incredulous tones

  it must have been clear even to the
most ignorant or the most casual ob-
server that he was like a man dis-
traught his brain had been so unex-
pectedly and strangely shocked that his
normal reactions of caution and self-
control of reason and quickness of wit
alike had been set awry you are
sure 

  here is the doctors certificate of
death said the young man simply pro-
ducing a paper and half extending it
ware waved it aside like one in a
trance he took a step toward the sheeted
figure and still as though acting with-
out his own volition put his hand-

cyrils fingers surprisingly strong for
all their slenderness closed viselike on
his wrist and thrust him back take
care he exclaimed sternly i would
not touch him if i were you have
you never heard of a corpse shedding
blood at the touch of the murderer
ah that got to you didnt it he
added as the dark man recoiled in-
stinctively with terror in his pale eyes

  but ware muttered passing his
hand over his wet forehead i dont
when dead lips speak



understand-i swear i didnt kill him
what did the doctor say he died of
he said he was puzzled and wants
an autopsy but i think it wont be nec-
essary weve got you very nearly
where we want you mr ware

  but gasped the wretched man
now completely unstrung you say he

didnt touch the-i mean- he

floundered trying to gather up the
shreds of his self-control cyril
laughed mercilessly

  and that about settles you he de-
clared calmly-but he still held the auto-
matic gone all to pieces havent
you  we thought you would
we echoed ware reeling a trifle
as he stood

  uncle adam and i went on cyril
inexorably and now since i really
know more about it on the whole than
you do-suppose i tell you in a few
short sweet words what you did be-
fore i telephone for the police

  the police youre mad what
for-

  to arrest you for plotting to kill
my great-uncle adam norton no
stand just where you are and hear it
all you knew uncle adam years ago
and made capital out of the only
crooked episode in his honest life-
that smuggling business in the west
indies

  he told you

  he told me a lot of things mr ash-
ton ware a whole lot of things he
didnt want to go to the police if he
could help it and he and i planned to
trick you you know i like acting
and for once he was willing he plot-
ted with you in order to get you to
commit yourself and all things taken
together i think you pretty well have
want to stay and fight for your rights
i wouldnt-not after your ginger-jar
break that was my living uncle who
spoke to you-for the last time i trust
you scoundrel

  but even before he had finished

speaking ashton ware had dashed
away past the startled maids his
swarthy face twisted with rage and ter-
ror alike

  hes gone sir commented judson
meekly i-im troubled about your
uncle sir if youll excuse me-

  he drew the sheet from adam nor-
tons face and looked down at it anx-
iously

  but cyril was in a gale of boyish

triumph

  it hasnt hurt you uncle has it
my little comedy-melodrama  he cried
hes all right isnt he judson

  hes breathing sir but oh sir i
warned you it would be too much for
him his poor heart-

  still cyril rattled on unheeding i
guess his fangs are pretty well drawn
uncle he cried turning to the deli-
cate old face above the white sheet
which still made the maids shiver it
was that deathly as you might say i
he wont trouble you again but say
it was lucky we sent his jar of ginger
to the laboratory and found it was poi-
soned wasnt it he chuckled
good old ginger jars they all look
pretty much the same and this had
him scared stiff his voice deepened
with a sudden emotion as he cams
closer of course it was a crazy the-
atrical way of doing it for any good
lawyer could have disposed of him
but you really didnt mind did you
uncle adam i think we played our
scene very well thank god it was
only playing a scene

  mr cyril sir- judson tried to

interrupt

  uncle adam now that were rid of
the brute lets turn on that beastly reo
ord i coaxed you to make for him
he sprang laughing to the phono-
graph and started it then laughing
still he faced his uncle again

  doesnt it just make the final touch
for the scene he cried gayly as the
instrument began its ghostly cyrif-


when dead lips speak

cyril then he started back himseli
as white as death

 uncle adam uncle adam he
cried wildly whats the matter
has my little melodrama really harmed
you speak to me uncle

  but even as he uttered the words he
knew that his uncle would never speak
to him again the strain and excite-
ment had proved too much for that
aged lightly beating heart adam
norton was stone dead

  its over mr cyril said judson in
a very low voice

  cyril covered his face with his hands
appalled remorseful but the phantom
voice of his uncle still vibrated on the
air of the death chamber a spectral al-
most a supernatural thing from the cold
wooden box in the corner weirdly ac-
companying the moment

  cyril-it is you who have killed
me-you whom i loaded with benefits
all the days of your life-it is only you
cyril who are responsible for this-

you cyril-cyril-

  judson came softly up to cyrils side
and laid a shaking timid hand upon his
arm the maids had gone silently away
at last

 mr cyril-

  the old mans eyes peered into his
dreadful accusing eyes the more accus-
ing because they begged for reassur-
ance mr cyril sir he went on
tremulously you didnt zvish for your
uncles death did you sir

  the terrible ghostly voice from the
phonograph went on and on and the
boy broke out into strangling sobs

  stop it he implored stop that
ghastly thing

  and judson immediately if tremu-
lously obedient even in that tragic mo-
ment stopped it

  after a moment of anguished silence
cyril made his way unsteadily to the
door

  ill never touch a cent of his money

never he vowed with all youths pas-

sion and pain and i-ill go off
somewhere and try to grow up my
fooling has cost uncle adam his life
and-and-god forgive me-i-maybe
i wasnt as careful of it as i should
have been  good-by judson

  good-by mr cyril the old eyes
blinked at him anxiously youre not
coming back sir

  no i never-never

  if it isnt making too free sir is
it a play actor youre going to be after
ail

  a play actor after this-horror
ive played my last part its life now
and learning how to be a man good-
by

  scarcely conscious of what he said
or did cyril norton fled from the room
and the house and judson was left
alone with his dead he approached
near to the sheeted body of adam nor-
ton and uncovering the fragile face
strangely stem now nodded slowly as
one who bows before the will of god

  then in that still room beside the
deathbed of his master the old valet
drew a long folded document from his
waistcoat pocket and opened it care-
fully for it was extremely precious

  again he nodded this too was
the will of god-oh decidedly the will
of god it was another of adam nor-
tons wills duly signed and attested
and there were a few lines that inter-
ested judson as no words had ever in-
terested him before

     a s my grand-nephew cyril
is quite capable of running away and
going on the stage against my wishes
and  am daily hounded by the base
ingratitude and extortions of a man 
used to befriend but whom  trust to
unmask and disarm before  die  wish
to state that in the event of no subse-
quent legitimate claim being made upon
my estate  leave all i die possessed
of to my faithful servant james jud-
son   

  a third time judson slowly nodded
when dead lips speak



he was pretty sure neither of them
would put in a claim as for the law-
yers well he would just tell them how
it was just tell them how it was ah
but-

  murderer

 he heard the one word rang
through the room with a strange silver
cadence that he had never heard before
he looked about him wildly in terror
unspeakable he was alone in the
chamber of death he had shut off the
phonograph yet the voice continued

  i did not suspect you in life in
death i know you for what you are
judson for months you have been
slowly poisoning me weakening my

heart accomplishing your end by the
most fiendish and patient means you

have succeeded-

  judson had collapsed in a cringing
shuddering heap but the awful ac-
cuser did not cease it went on re-
lentlessly with the clarity of a silver
bell

  what is it moaned the wretched
little old man beside himself what
is it oh what is it what is it

  but he knew it was the vocamorta
the vocamorta which he had always
feared and it was really working at
last it was the voice of the dead and
that voice was speaking to-him

  in fact judson had gone quite mad

always tell the truth

 entered the bedroom as stealthily as a burglar and congratulated myself
when in the dim light my wife appeared to be asleep

without warning she suddenly sat up in bed dived under the pillow for
her watch and peevishly said

    frank its half past two where on earth have you been

    without a seconds hesitation i replied in the most disagreeable voice i could
summon up and with exaggerated emphasis on each word

    where do you think ive been out with a chorus girl of course took
her to supper and afterward spent an hour at her apartment smoking and
drinking

    oh dear sighed my wife drowsily dont be silly why cant you say
youve been at the club playing billiards or cards and then she turned over
and went to sleep
a nice butterworth be-
loved and only child of worthy
and zebedee butterzvorth
aged nine years and three weeks
requiescat in pace 

  that is the inscription as for the
first part it is plain enough he who
runs may read but for the latin in-
scription there are those in sellersville
who assert that it has not always been
true

  while there is nothing outre about
the tiny marker with its sculptured
words nothing out of the ordinary
about the softly sloping mound cov-
ered as with a coverlet of living green
by the english ivy that has grown
closely over it yet there is something
strange about that grave that draws a
strangers attention as would a load-
stone and holds it until the story of
little anice butterworth and the wax
doll has transformed idle curiosity into
deep wonder and aching pity

  about her grave there lies a litter
of childrens toys some of them worn
and faded some of them quite new and
shiny and chief among them all is

a great weather-beaten wax doll that
sits against the headstone gazing va-
cantly across the burial ground from
her post of vantage why the toys
why the battered doll they are for
anice to play with you will be told
by any sellersville child

  poor little anice she has her share
of toys now god only knows with
what agony of longing and remorse her
bereaved parents put them there for
her eyes to gloat upon for her unseen
fingers to caress if it be true that
our every action brings with it the ap-
propriate reward or castigation then
how terribly have worthy and zebedee
butterworth been punished for their
blind willful ignorance of the heart of
a little child

  they had their own ideas about
bringing up children did worthy and
zebedee her people had been the
kind that never smiled on the sabbath
day for fear god might be offended at
their sinful levity zebedees had been
the kind that wept over every penny
spent and-figuratively speaking-
killed the fatted calf over each dollar
the wax doll



that came in the combination of tem-
peraments proved an unfortunate one
for the innocent victim

  from the time she was old enough
to take notice anice butterworth had
been an object of deep commiseration
to sellersville she was never seen
playing as other children do and she
was never permitted a toy toys cost
money her father said her mothers
reason was deeper laid if we miser-
able sinners expect to attain heaven
eventually we must offer unto god the
sacrifice of a broken and contrite spirit
she asserted this was interpreted as
a sacrifice of every joy-inspiring emo-
tion of the human heart between the
two of them they gave their only child
a fine babyhood and little girlhood

  they loved her-her father and
mother they loved her with an affec-
tion that almost terrified them by its
strength but the more they realized
its depth the more they felt assured
that it was an idolatrous passion that
must be strangled in its birth the
eastern mothers superstitious terror
that her babes beauty will bring upon
it the curse of the evil eye was as
nothing to the fear of these christian
parents that god would punish their
presumption in loving so deeply and
tenderly what was after all a thing of
flesh so they crucified anice to save
her from the wrath of god crucified
her on the cross of their own terrors
and gloated over her misery in a vain
belief that they were propitiating the
almighty for her benefit

  sellersville looked on indignantly but
impotently to see the loving little crea-
ture crushed slowly and systematically
under the juggernaut created by her
parents she was deprived conscien-
tiously of everything that promised to
give her pleasure her father re-
peatly told her that playthings cost too
much which was his way of refusing
her what he felt was harmful to her
salvation her mother taught her that

god loves those who fear him and
carefully guided those tiny faltering
feet into paths of darkness and terror
that the heavenly father surely never
meant her tender youth to travel
anice became an old little thing at six
years of age-age measured by stand-
ards of time at nine she was older
than the oldest inhabitant if one judged
her age by the gleam of her crushed
soul out of inexpressibly pathetic eyes

  it was only natural that people should
try to soften the harsh rules the but-
terworths had laid down for the little
girl by giving her playthings from time
to time not that it did much good
either the toys were returned with
frigid courtesy or they disappeared en-
tirely from the face of the earth so far
as anice was concerned worthy but-
terworth filled every moment of anices
time with doleful readings from some
fearfully pious book of ancient ser-
mons or with plain sewing that bane
of the life of little girls very early
anice had learned to give up attempts
to play make-believe by herself her
mother soon learned of this wayward
tendency and enforced her ideas upon
the child by keeping the poor little crea-
ture constantly at her side busied with
her morbid reading or with some patch-
work

  on anices ninth birthday neverthe-
less sellersville people plucked up suf-
ficient courage to dare cross the path
of the juggernaut they got together
and bought a special gift for anice a
wonderfully beautiful great wax doll
dressed marvelously in silk and laces
a doll to have warmed the heart of even
the most pampered little girl the
ladies sewing circle of the methodist
church collected the money for this
present with great privacy and then
went in a body to the butterworth
house on anices birthday to present
her boldly with the doll

  worthy could hardly have refused
the gift her husband had recently


the wax doll

given the church a donation-generous
for him-toward new pews and she
felt that the doll was by way of being
appreciative recognition on the part of
the sewing circle zebedee could not
have refused it if he would there was
something in the attitude of the ladies
presenting it that prevented his saying
a word moreover it had cost a good
deal and he knew it he figured it
could be put away against the day when
anice would no longer be captured by
such worldly toys yet both the but-
terworths were inwardly certain that
the possession of this doll would be the
complete ruination of their little daugh-
ter

  during the hour that the members of
the circle remained in the house anice
butterworth sat in their midst the mar-
velous doll in her arms enjoying such
an ecstasy of exaltation as the poor
little creature had never experienced in
her entire short life on a low has-
sock she sat her feet straight before
her on the floor her little petticoats-
painfully sewed washed and smoothed
and ironed by her own busy hands-
stiffly refusing to be smoothed down
decorously enough to give the wonder-
ful doll a comfortable seat not that
she noticed this objectively she was
too completely wrapped up in the ex-
quisite joy of holding in her own arms
against her beating little heart such a
plaything as she had never in her wild-
est imaginings dreamed might be hers
to hold it unrebuked-what bliss
what unutterable felicity

  she clung to it hardly daring a close
examination lest she might draw upon
herself the disapprobation of her par-
ents  occasionally she stole a downward
glance into the smiling waxen face
with an expression of such tender ad-
oration on her own that some of the
ladies afterward declared that it
brought tears to their eyes one hand
stroked the silken skirts caressingly
with slow motions of luxurious enjoy-

ment  the other gripped the doll to her
feverishly for an hour-one excru-
ciatingly beautiful hour-anice lived
such emotions as other children spread
over years of childhood experience

  the ladies rose to go one of them
asked her what will you name your
doll anice

  without a particle of hesitation but
as if she had already cogitated long and
seriously upon this difficult subject and
had come to a firm decision anice had
replied a world of affection in her
tones

  belovedp

  and amid the cautiously exchanged
glances she buried her face deeply with
a sigh of utter contentment in the
silken attire of her treasure

  anices ninth birthday became an
event of much speculation in sellers-
ville as might be surmised it was for
a time believed that the ladies sew-
ing circle had managed by their gift
to alter the attitude of the butterworths
toward the poor little one every-
where the wish was expressed that
anice might from then on enjoy some
of the innocent pleasures and happiness
of life that other children had so freely
as their just portion but our villagers
were yet to learn that they had reck-
oned without their butterworths

  out of deference to the opinions of
the ladies who had just left the house
worthy did not immediately exile the
wax doll from sight she took it firmly
from anices arms and set it high out
of reach upon a mantel do not think
this simple act was accomplished with
ease for once in her life the little girl
resented from the very depths of her
child nature the wrong that she instinc-
tively felt was being put upon her she
clung to the beautiful plaything with
fierce strength she actually kicked at
her mother with stoutly clad little feet
she screamed and gritted her teeth in
mad determination not to be parted
from her first and only love worthy
the wax oll



actually found it necessary to pry the
clinging fingers from the silken gar-
ments of the disturber of the family by
main force

  the worse anice behaved the more
strongly was worthy convinced that in
keeping playthings from the child she
had acted wisely if the single hours
association with a mere wax doll could
affect anice so terribly after nine years
of careful training how would she have
acted worthy wondered had she al-
ways been permitted toys

  zebedee agreed fully with his wife
in her action and in her opinion he
went a little further he took the doll
from the mantel and hid it in the gar-
ret

  anices sad fall from grace was
meted out severe punishment in allot-
ting which worthy showed her ingenu-
ity the child had to read aloud page
after page of foxs martyrs for days
while her mother passed in and out of
the room to which the child had been
banished for a week she was also
condemned to rip out and make over
an entire patchwork quilt which she had
but recently finished with innocent
pride and satisfaction as well as infi-
nite labor

  the childish mind rebelled god
knows how bitterly but in silence she
sat quietly in her high-backed chair and
read in toneless monotony the horrors
of the early martyrs sufferings or bent
dull eyes upon the bits of colored cloth
which she had ripped apart and must
sew together again

 when the weeks punishment had
ended they missed her one night from
her bed after hearing soft footsteps
stealing along the hall zebedee in-
tuitively went at orice to the attic the
line of his mouth tightening ominously
and it was there he found her the
small face raised to his smiling and
contented the little arms clasped
warmly about the bone of contention
which lay against her aching heart he

stood looking down at her with strange
expressions chasing each other across
his stem countenance he returned to
bed with the simple observation that
she must have walked in her sleep to
the garret and that he had thrown a
coverlet over her and left her there
it would be time enough in the morn-
ing he said to settle with her worthy
knew only too well what had taken the
child to the garret but she gave no
outward sign of her knowledge she
acquiesced with her husbands words

  in the morning anice was parted
again from the doll although she
showed herself yet more obstreperous
and determined refusing to be sep-
arated from her beloved the tears
the cries the pleading all fell upon
unseeing eyes and deaf ears such was
the love of those two for her future
salvation that they damned her earthly
happiness completely

  by degrees the child became calmer
but her expression was one that al-
most terrified her parents by its un-
earthly resolution

  i shall always find my beloved
she declared rebellious eyes and com-
pressed lips defying them you can-
not keep her away from me we can-
not be separated because she loves me
as i love her

  that was in late autumn winter
came on as it sometimes does in a sud-
den unexpected storm of biting cold
bitter winds and driving snow from
november soddenness of skies emerged
the bleak december weather

  during the days that followed anice
made no further outward signs of the
rebellion she had so passionately de-
clared she sewed her wrinkled little
patches together again she read the
horrors of the martyrs with dull indif-
ference but no word no sign escaped
her in regard to the wax doll her
parents congratulated each other that
she had entirely forgotten it it was
not so and they were soon to learn


the wax doll

how tragically deep had grown anices
love for her beloved

  zebedee had put the doll in the wood-
shed locking it in without further pre-
cautions of concealment from the child
whose great dark eyes followed his
every movement as he carried her be-
loved away he remarked to worthy
half contemptuously that he guessed
hed settled that matter for good and
all he was to recall his words after-
ward with what agony of remorse

  sellersville can never forget the bliz-
zard that raged for three days that win-
ter covering the entire countryside with
deep drifts

  the third night of the storm worthy
butterworth roused from her sleep and
grasped at her husband shaking him
from his sleep she thought she had
heard a strange noise he sat up and
listened intently

  it was anice sobbing in her sleep
that they heard and she was call-
ing in heart-rending tones beloved
beloved

  the mothers heart ached within her
but her thoughts of an angry and jeal-
ous god restrained her and hardened
her

  do you suppose we have been wrong
about that doll  she did go so far as
to whisper to her husband

  he shook his head emphatically but
even as he denied the possibility of an
error in their judgment he felt that
weakening toward the sobbing dream-
ing child which proves to us what play-
things we ourselves are in the force of
our emotions

  they composed themselves to sleep
again but their dreams were troubled
so troubled that although she could
not remember what hers had been
about worthv rose with the first dim
light of a white day that broke in
through the swirling snow beating and
tearing with pale malevolent fingers at
the windows and went to anices room

to assure herself that the child was
sleeping quietly

  her wild scream brought zebedee to
her side in a flash

 my baby where is my baby
she shrieked sudden terror clutching
madly at her heart something is
wrong something has happened to
anice

  her husband strove to quiet her

  anice is probably hiding in the gar-
ret again he assured her but he knew
his words were foolish the wax doll
was not in the garret

  he began to tremble with the vio-
ence of the emotion that shook worthy
whom he was supporting

  with dazed vacant eyes she looked
from the window as though she could
pierce the blinding flurries of snow

  god forgive us she screamed
she is there-there

  she fell a limp weight in his arms

  he laid her on the bed he did not
dare wait to bring her back to merci-
less consciousness for by this time
something pulled at him with invisible
hands that would not be denied he
let himself be led

  out of the kitchen door into the
shrieking howling storm he went the
bitter cold penetrating his very heart
chilling it so that it beat slowly and
sluggishly as though some power from
without were striving to stop its beat-
ing down the pathway he plunged
blindly fighting for every step against
the surging of that mighty wind ter-
rifying apprehensions growing upon
him with every step his leaden feet
dragged him back when he tried to
pull them through the deep drifts that
in three days and nights had changed
the entire aspect of the countryside
on he went to the woodshed where
but a short three weeks ago he had
hidden the wax doll away from the
longing heart that had loved it so ten-
derly from the gentle hands that would
have caressed it so lovingly
the wax doll



  it was there he found his only child
as he knew he would white as the
snow that covered her thin little night-
dress pale as the pallor of that dead
morning she half reclined half knelt
as if in supplication against the door
that kept her away from her beloved
upon the childish face was a frozen
appeal in the wide open staring eyes
an entreaty they were the more
pathetic and heart-rending because zcb-
edee knew their meaning well and
knew that it had gone unanswered

  the father gathered up her poor lit-
tle body and holding it tightly to him
as though to cool the fires of burn-
ing grief that consumed him fought
his way back to the house

  worthy stood at the door to receive
him mercifully had the knowledge
come to her of the tragic death of her
only child it did not stagger her now
as with a sudden blow she knew well
what had befallen she stood there
dumbly holding out her arms for that
precious little body

  it was natural and inevitable that
they should have tried everything their
brains could devise in mad and hope-
less efforts to call back the spirit of
their only child to its deserted habita-
tion all was vain they knew it
even while they worked over the cold
lifeless body but their unutterable
grief hoping against the evidence of
their senses drove them on until they
reached the moment where they ad-
mitted to each other with despairing
glances that their efforts were futile
anice had slipped quietly away from
them in the terror of that surging storm
of howling wind and driving snow
never to return

  their grief was terrible but they
repressed it as they had always forced
themselves to repress the tenderer emo-
tions of their hearts the lord had
given the lord had taken away
blessed be the name of the lord of
their own instrumentality in this tak-

ing away did they ever think at all
who knows

  dumbly numbly they went about
their daily tasks then zebedee hitched
up and went for the undertaker
tlirough the wild gusts of wind that
whipped him as he drove while the
mother dry-eyed sat by the body of
her only child

  the storm had died down when the
day of her funeral came so that the
morning dawned shining upon a spot-
lessly beautiful world of dazzling
vhite in harmony with the pure little
soul that had taken flight they made
her grave where you can see it now
and a few days afterward the head-
stone so pitiful in its pathetic brevity
and the condensed tragedy of its in-
scription marked her resting place
they left her then to repose in peace
but did she opinion even in sellers-
ville is divided on that point

  zebedee did not go near the wood-
shed until he was actually forced by
the necessity for firewood to unlock
the door he dared not face the silent
reproach in the fixed smile of the wax
doll reminding him of the beloved lit-
tle one who had gone from him for-
ever when he came out with his
armful of wood a strange expression
rested on his face an expression of
mingled incredulity and horror he
said nothing to worthy at this time

  im imagining things he muttered
to himself

  but the next time wood was needed
he managed that worthy should fetch
it when she returned he said to her
with a repressed air of excitement
where-where was the doll 

  on the shelf she replied wonder-
ingly looking at him with query in
her sad eyes

 were there-were there boxes-
piled under the shelf-as if-as if-
some one had tried to climb up-to the
doll  he faltered shamefacedly his
eyes avoiding hers


the wax doll

  she stopped short on her way to the
woodbox near the stove to regard him
with a searching gaze

  just what do you mean she de-
manded nervously

  oh nothing nothing he cried
quickly as if denying an allegation
made

  she withdrew her eyes but stood for
a long moment with knit brows before
she proceeded with her work

  the following day it was worthy
who went first early in the morning
for the wood- she had gone with a
purpose because she had lain awake
all night hearing-perhaps she had been
fanciful morbid in her thoughts-the
sound as of a childs voice crooning
it even seemed to her that she had dis-
tinguished words

  beloved beloved the voice kept
murmuring plaintively

  she knew she must check her vain
imaginings born of brooding over
anices tragic death she realized that
the terrible event of the last night of
the blizzard had wrought up her nerves
to finest tension but she felt she must
satisfy herself once forall that her
fancies were absolutely unfounded so
that her reason could in future rebuke
them

  therefore she went with faltering
but determined step to the woodhouse
and opened the door the key of which
she had herself retained since the pre-
ceding morning yesterday she had
removed a number of wooden boxes
from under the shelf where the doll lay
and pushed them to the other side of
the shed this morning as she peered
into the semidarkness she saw dis-
tinctly that the boxes were back under
the shelf piled one upon the other as
a child might place them who desired
to reach the shelf above and further
the wax doll which yesterday her own
eyes had seen lying on the shelf was
sitting against the wall on the floor of
the shed at the foot of the boxes i

  worthy did not advance a foot
across the threshold she stood without
stupefied strange and dreadful
thoughts assailed her and beat down
upon her she could not bear it but
fled to the house she made zebedee
go for the wood then she went into
the rarely used front room shut the
door and remained alone the rest of
the morning

  her husband did not disturb her too
well he knew why she had gone away
by herself he too had seen the pile
of boxes under the shelf put there by
other hands than his or hers put there
as if a child had piled them up to reach
the shelf where had lain the forbid-
den plaything

  he brought back wood but when he
came into the kitchen he was paler than
he had ever been in his life and was
trembling in every limb the wood
fell unheeded from his nerveless hands
upon the floor and he sank weakly into
a chair struggling with difficulty to
compose his thoughts

  winter passed on with chill and
dragging footsteps late spring found
the butterworths grayer more worn
more wan than even the loss of a be-
loved child seemed to indicate the
uncanny secret that had become a part
of their lives was pulling them down
both mentally and physically by may
worthy had grown so weak that zeb-
edee hitched up one morning and went
for the doctor

  serena love joy saw him pass and
surmised his errand for her farm ad-
joined the butterworth place she ran
across the private road between the
farms and made an unexpected visit
to worthy at first glance serena
divined that here was no malady of
body but the gnawing canker of men-
tal sickness halfway measures by no
means suited her so she abruptly
opened the subject to her hostess

  better tell me about it worthy
the wax doll



she said simply and directly i half
believe i know anyway what is trou-
bling you perhaps i can find the way
out

  mrs butterworth looked long and
deeply into the grave but tender eyes
of her neighbor

  perhaps you can she considered
then with sudden sharp pain wrack-
ing her soul serena she is not at
rest in her grave my poor little baby
comes back every night-to play-with
her wax doll

  poor baby whispered serena un-
derstandingly she was credited with
being a seer go on poor soul tell
me the rest

  i cannot bear it wailed the
wretched worthy her hands pressed
agonizedly to her temples there is
no night that i can sleep always there
comes her voice calling beloved
what can i do-what can i do-to give
peace to my babys soul

  she broke down sobbing into her
hands

  serena regarded her with mingled
pity and reproach she shook her head
slowly then she put a gentle hand on
the weeping mothers shoulder

  stop crying and listen to me she
commanded give me the key to the
woodshed and i promise you
worthy that you will hear no crying
to-night

  it was as she said that night the

bereaved parents slept better than they
had for months worthy went across
the road the following morning to ask
serena what she had done

  go down to the burial ground to
anices grave serena responded seri-
ously i think then-you will under-
stand

  and so worthy butterworth re-
ceived the severest lesson of all her
self-sustained life

  sitting against the little headstone
that marked the grave of anice but-
terworth aged nine years and three
weeks was the gayly dressed play-
thing that had been the innocent cause
of the tragedy smiling fixedly blue
eyes meaningless and glassy under
fringed lids the wax doll waited pa-
tiently for night to bring its playmate
back anice had not far to go to find
her beloved any more

  as the graves of indian chiefs are
loaded with the good things of life
that their spirits may attend upon the
phantom of the dead so to-day the
grave of anice butterworth is never
without a new toy reverently laid there
by the hands of her parents

  and the christmas tree with its won-
derful adornments that each yuletide
presides over the sunday-school room
of the methodist church is the an-
nual gift of zebedee and worthy but-
terworth to the children of sellersville

  and anice requiescat in pace f

chapter ix

on the beach

prince chan still wearing his
black coat although his linen was
alarmingly soiled looked blandly
at balderson he gave no sign of emo-
tion the big viking folded his arms
and stared at desmond

oh said the latter getting his pipe
filled and lighted now we can chat

well balderson why dont you take
the money if you want it

  with only one gun among the four
of us huh snapped balderson
hand over some guns throw in with
us white men-and well pull clear 
thanks for your confidence and
desmond smiled slightly why not
hand over the money to balderson
prince chan

  because we want the money our-
the opium ship

selves said the manchu chuckling
is not that very logical also we are
the strongest party

  do you know where we are in-
tervened rosemonde

on paracel island we believe said
the prince such at least is our
guess we have the place to ourselves
is that a threat  demanded des-
mond

  by no means let us call it a warn-
ing my dear sir

  look here you v broke out balder-
son with a vehement impatience cant
you see what these chinks want  they
want to put all of us out o the way
thajs what-sos we cant tell no sto-
ries give em this ship and were
gone once they get their guns on us
its all us whites in the same boat
desmond hang together and we got
a chance huh 

  desmond regarded the giant keenly
but made no response after a mo-
ment he turned to prince chan

  is this island inhabited

  no returned the manchu

  listen now while i make ye a
counter proposition you send dona
juliana aboard here right away and
one o these boats likewise by two
oclock this afternoon well leave the
ship to you opium and all taking with
us what stores well need thats all
does it suit

  i agree said the prince quietly
balderson was purple with rage but
desmond tinned to the giant with a
slow look

  mind your talk in the presence of a
lady me lad or ill make ye do it
if you and your three mates want to
go off with us youre welcome ill
desert no man when we get picked
up o course youll stand your chances

of trial for mutiny-

  blast you cried balderson fury
sweeping over him wont listen to
me huh you throw in with them
cursed chinks and dyou know whatll

happen all hands gets their throats
cut thats what and the ladies-what
dyou think the chinks are layin for
huh  women you fool see here
you lady are you willin to trust
them chinks

  this was an appeal direct to rose-
monde prince chan stood blandly ob-
livious of all that balderson said but
his black eyes flickered slightly as he
looked at rosemonde to her also
looked desmond she appeared en-
tirely unconcerned

  i agree with whatever decision mr
desmond makes she said coolly

  youll desert us white men cried
balderson desmond you and your

fine talk-

  you listen a moment cut in des-
mond incisively balderson youve
admitted that you and your friends
were partners with arevalo you saw
your owner and mate murdered you
had a hand in murdering your skipper
last night you helped arevalo to carry
off miss juliana now that arevalo
is dead and youve lost out you come
whining to me for weapons

  desmond rose clear out balder-
son  ill give you nothing but the
wrong end of a fist you dirty scum
put a hand to that gun in your pocket
and ill murder you get ashore and
keep out o my way i want no help
from a pack like yours and ill give
ye none thunder o finn if youre
not off this boat in two shakes ill lack
ye off

  balderson looked him in the eyes for
a moment then with a single mut-
tered oath turned about and leaped
into his boat desmond gestured to
the prince

  thats all send out miss juliana
and turn over a boat to us

  with a curt inclination of his head
the prince assented and took his de-
parture

  scowling desmond watched the two
boats pull toward the shore it was


the opium ship

obvious that balderson and his three
men were afraid of the manchus and
dared not try to make off with their
boat

  what will ye be tryin to do now
piped up osullivan sure its no
small boat can live long in this wind
look at the waves out yonder now

 desmond turned frowning both
the fiddler and rosemonde were watch-
ing him in anxious waiting he read un-
rest and disquiet in their gaze

  dont bother me askin what well
do next michael terence he answered
moodily time enough for that when
its due

 you think prince chan can be
trusted asked rosemonde

  no farther than i can see him re-
turned desmond will he let us get
away to tell all whats happened not
if he can help it balderson was right
enough about that

  then-youll keep your word with
him 

  i will said desmond doggedly
call us when ye see them coming with
juliana and the fiddler and i will be
getting out the stores come michael
terence wed best be movin

  desmond to be exact thought the
situation nothing short of desperate
he had no idea that the manchu could
be trusted and he would have nothing
whatever to do with balderson his
only chance as he saw it lay in put-
ting balderson into so much more des-
perate a position that balderson and
die other three would be driven to ex-
treme measures he rightly judged
balderson to be a dangerous man in
action whether balderson would at-
tempt any overt act against the man-
chus was another question

  its a terrible temptation michael
terence soliloquized desmond as he
and the fiddler got down into the lazaret
and began breaking out stores think
o those heathen chinamen with a mil-
lion in opium and a chest o gold i

theyll most likely bury the opium some-
where ashore until they can arrange to
get it and dispose of it somehow but
the gold they can take away conve-
niently no wonder baldersons mouth
waters 

  and no wonder hes layin low
added osullivan fifteen o them
divils will fight like fifty when it comes
to gold an opium its not me that
would be wanting to rob the likes of
them we should ha took up with
balderson im thinkin

  desmond grunted fine business
that would have been balderson and
his three mates are utter scum if they
took a notion to cut our throats and
seize the ladies theyd never bother
about consequences but the chinese
are canny men and they look to the
end theyre safer to deal with

  maybe and maybe not said the
fiddler dubiously

  together they got a pile of stores out
of the lazaret or run and hauled them
on deck as they finished the task
there came from the tree-clad island
the sound of a single shot followed by
silence the shore was deserted the
two boats empty

  whos shooting i wonder ob-
served desmond while the fiddler and
rosemonde watched the shore with un-
easy eyes michael terence have that
fiddle of yours ready to go ashore
dont forget it and be having to come
back after it now if it were not for
juliana id swim ashore and haul off
those boats

  but demanded rosemonde what
can we do after she is returned to us
we cannot put out to sea in a small
boat-look at the waves outside the
lagoon

  true enough by to-morrow we
can leave and until then well have to
stay ashore we can run up the shore
inside the lagoon and find a likely
place
the opium ship



  ten minutes later prince chan and
six of his men debouched from the
trees dona juliana accompanying them
desmond saw that she had quite recov-
ered from the fright which she must
have suffered she was talking and
laughing with the prince who was
plainly endeavoring to make himself
very agreeable

  thank heaven for that said des-
mond devoutly i was afraid shed
be a nervous wreck-well rosemonde
and what are ye laughing at now
you retorted rosemonde merrily
but refused to explain herself further

  the boat took in tow the second
boat and drew out to the schooner
the latter was now heeling farther
over as the tide was ebbing and her
rail was not far from the water when
the boats came alongside desmond
caught julianas hand and brought her
easily to the deck

  welcome home he cried its
well you are thats good if youll
join rosemonde and get your things
packed up well be leaving presently
shell explain matters well prince
chan how soon will ye have the
ship

  whenever you leave her answered
the manchu looking up from his seat
in the boat

  what was that shooting ashore
balderson shot one of my men re-
turned the other his features placid
and masked you had bettter be careful
about going ashore he and his com-
rades are in the bush

  oh thought desmond so you
are already certain that well go ashore
eh thats bad aloud he said
thanks for the warning well be
gone in an hour think you can get
the schooner off the rocks

  prince chan smiled and shook his
head

  no what could we do with her
what port could we enter no we
shall attend to the opium and then de-

part in our boat in an hour then
thank you au revoir 

  desmond watched them rowing in to-
ward the shore a puzzled frown creas-
ing his brow the manchu had spoken
too openly too frankly

  well said osullivan the
ladies are below sir what dye think
that boy has been cookin up for us
eh 

  murder said desmond turning
and meeting the piercing black eyes of
of the fiddler murder michael ter-
ence and no less he knows well
have to get ashore for a day or so by
that time theyll have the stuff buried
theyll finish us to keep us quiet aye
were in a tight place me lad if twas
you and me now id put out to sea
in the boat but we cant do that wi
the ladies

  after a moment he continued re-
flectively theres something big to
all this me lad arevalo was a rich
man in his way and mind you he was
buyin a million dollars worth of opium
roughly buyin it for a syndicate
most like a syndicate of hellions like
himself but they couldnt keep a mil-
lion in a chest not if it was in gold
osullivan chuckled

  by this an by that he said sagely
ive a notion whats runnin in your
mind this minute i have if twas

not for the ladies now-

  desmond rubbed his chin and smiled
with sudden hope listen now
dona juliana has been cruelly wronged
isnt it arevalo owes her somethin
and rosemonde the same besides
would it be right to let those yellow
men steal all that money it would
not

  the fiddler laughed wildly and
theres you and me sir into the bar-
gain  could we be doin it now  as
the skipper would say it ud be a right-
eous deed

  well see lets be getting the stuff
into the boat lad


the opium ship

  they were still working with the pro-
visions when rosemonde appeared and
informed desmond that juliana wanted
to see him she was getting a few
things together and had been acquainted
with the situation

  desmond passed below to the cabin
where he found juliana now wearing
a gown of deep-yellow silk making a
bundle of her things she faced him
with a tragic gesture

  we must leave all this-be aban-
doned

  be glad youre getting out of it
safe miss juliana returned desmond
we have worse yet ahead im
afraid the yellow men intend to mur-
der us all if they can do it-they aim
to catch us off guard later on

  her blue eyes flashed ah but
you will prevent this

  ill be thinkin about it said des-
mond whimsically bless the sweet
face of you was prince chan very
entertaining 

  he was a thorough gentleman she
answered albeit a trifle coldly he
rescued me from those ruffians and was
very polite

  oh  said desmond and smiled into
her eyes if any one had foretold a
month ago that you would be kidnaped
and shipwrecked and have all these ex-
citin adventures would you have be-
lieved it ill warrant not its
changed you too

  how she demanded a bit suspi-
ciously

  well its put new life into your
eyes and a marvelous fine color into
your cheeks and the most wonder-
ful-

  this is neither time nor place for
compliments sir she broke in hastily
yet with no displeasure in her eyes
may i ask when we are going ashore
as soon as youre ready said des-
mond may i take this bit bundle

  he stooped for it and she stooped
as hastily in order to tuck in sundry

tag-ends of lace for an instant their
hands touched desmond straightened
up with the bundle and turned to the

door

  come when youre ready he said
blithely and was gone

  had he seen juliana standing and
gazing after him a heightened color in
her cheeks her bosom rising and fall-
ing rapidly and her blue eyes widen-
ing upon his departure he might have
been a trifle uneasy but desnlond was
oblivious

  he saw to loading the boat method-
ically as he had anticipated the mast
and sail had been removed and this
confirmed his suspicions of the man-
chu however desmond got into the
sail locker and located a spare spanker
which he turned over to the fiddler

  load it in me lad itll serve to
shelter the ladies to-night ill intro-
duce ye to the mysteries of needle an
palm to-morrow and with the aid of
an oar well go away from here on the
wings of the wind-if we go i have
a notion that well stop a while

  dona juliana came on deck and after
getting her in the stern with rose-
monde while michael terence care-
fully bestowed his fiddle case forward
desmond took an oar and the two men
shoved forth

  its hardly the appropriate sort o
shipwrecked party observed desmond
cheerfully since weve no outfit of
weapons beyond four automatics and
the natural battery of languishing orbs
which you ladies possess however
well make the best of it and trust to
luck for the rest

  he guided their course northward
away from the boat which still lay upon
the sands and kept osullivan at work
until the lagoon whose outer reef
formed a breastwork for the entire
length of the island narrowed down
they were nearly a mile from the
schooner by this time and when at last
he perceived a tiny creek that emptied
the opium ship



itself into the lagoon desmond swung
hard on his oar and headed for the
shore

  as they pulled up the boat osulli-
van was taken with a fit of coughing
desmond eyed him for an instant and
caught a significant glance from rose-
monde

  run off with you michael terence
he said and make sure the vicinity
is clear of balderson and his murderin
friends ill be makin camp the while

  the fiddler departed and vanished
among the trees desmond began to
unload the boat at which rosemonde
came to help him and later dona juli-
ana he chose a fair camping spot be-
side the creek and had the heavy work
done long before osullivan returned
with word that there was no sign of
other folk in the vicinity

  with the spare sail mounted on trees
and oars as a canopy for the ladies
osullivan played his fiddle when the
sunset was crimsoning and afterward
saying that the black mood was on
him set the fiddle under his arm and
vanished along the shore to the north

  he will not last long poor man
said rosemonde softly his
cough-

  i know said desmond sucking at
his dry pipe and he knows too
mores the pity

  dona juliana leaned forward did
you ever see him smile theres some-
thing rarely beautiful in his eyes when
he smiles the soul perhaps and
you say that he is not blind to his ill-
ness ah that isunusual i believe
usually men are blind to the things
that concern them so closely and
deeply

  rosemonde looked at dona juliana
under the darkening shadows the eyes
of the two women met and held for a
space and in their gaze were strange
things strange depths and silences
dona juliana drew a long breath like
a sigh

  ill be leaving you and desmond
rose to his feet good night ladies
god be with you the night

   he strode off into the darkness whis-
tling softly but the two women did
not speak after he had gone

chapter x

in the night

pvesmond wakened at midnight or
shortly afterward he and
osullivan had been stretched out in
the sand now in the starlight des-
mond saw that the fiddler had disap-
peared he lay quiet wondering what
had so distinctly awakened him

  there was still a steady wind blow-
ing rustling the palms and trees of the
island while the surf crashed and
boomed unendingly from the reefs
suddenly a thin distant sound punc-
tuated the boom of surf with sharp dis-
tinctness that must be the second
shot thought desmond as he rose and
pocketed the two pistols which had
lain beside him the sounds were too
distant and slight to awaken the women
he reflected

  what made michael terence slip
off and how longs he been gone now 
thought desmond

  he strode off down the beach in the
starlight confident that things were
happening at the other end of the island
or thereabouts with the morrow he
felt they might put to sea in the boat
-but hewas by no means anxious to
put to sea until he had to he had
remembered that upon reaching the
outer world he would be penniless and
the thought of arevalos chest was very
good to linger upon

  the beach widened by the ebb tide
stretched before him like a white rib-
bon bounded by the dark trees and the
darker water a phosphorescent glow
marked the outer reef and the white
line of the surf there suddenly des-
mond looking at the reef out of the


the opium ship

tail of his eye saw something move on
the beach behind him he turned-
swiftly and saw a dark figure advanc-
ing upon him

  it was rosemonde

  i heard the shots too she an-
nounced simply

  oh said desmond i took for
granted youd watch over the camp
while i was gone

  she came closer looked into his face
and suddenly broke into low sweet
laughter that was very joyous to hear

  you almost fooled me monsieur

  desmond grinned but a trifle rue-
fully he had not thought that her
brain was quick enough to catch his
ruse

  come along then he said wed
better keep in close to the trees im
thinking did you leave miss juliana
asleep 

  sound asleep-and very beautiful
did you ever see a more beautiful
woman 

  no said desmond honestly but
sheer beauty in itself doesnt matter
particularly its character that counts
that makes beauty i think now that
if juliana had the proper training like
a few months more o this sort of life
shed be twice as beautiful her com-
plexion might be spoiled but shed
have more behind the complexion

  and you would like to educate her
then

  no will you stop twisting my
words now id sooner be walkin
along the sand here with you than edu-
cating all the beautiful women on
earth

  you dont count me among the beau-
tiful ones questioned rosemonde de-
murely well i admire your frank-
ness at least souznens-toi de ceci on
ifpa que vage que von parait-

  taisez-vous said desmond sud-
denly halting her with a touch on her
arm there is something moving
ahead-

  he was cut short by a low cry a
cry barely heard yet appalling in its
agony it seemed to come from di-
rectly ahead of them and an instant
later a dark shape came staggering out
upon the sand to fall prostrate

  wait here commanded desmond
and ran forward

  he found himself stooping above a
man-one of the manchus-who had
been stabbed terribly in the side the
man must have died as he uttered that
low wordless cry

  desmond peered into the night a
dark mass offshore indicated the wreck
of the san gregorio it was without a
light seemingly abandoned but the
second boat which should have been
drawn up on the sand was gone des-
mond rejoined rosemonde at the edge
of the trees

  i dont understand this he said
perplexed that boats gone yet the
manchus seem to be still ashore-that
is one of them stabbed to death

  ah she exclaimed then the
big-bearded man this balderson has
attacked the prince

  will you return to the camp de-
manded desmond suddenly grave

  merci nonv

  then come

  he set off across the sand rose-
monde at his elbow skirting the trees
and seeking some sign of the encamp-
ment which he knew must lie in among
the trees insensibly desmond quick-
ened his stride until he was a few
feet ahead of rosemonde

  a shadow moved among the trees
a mere blot upon the blackness close
at hand a long finger of the shadow
seemed to lick out at desmonds feet
tripped by the stick he fell headlong
the first touch had warned him al-
though too late to save himself as
he plunged to the sand he flung out
his arm his automatic exploded a
dark figure that had sprung out upon
rosemonde behind him whirled and
the opium ship



screamed once as it plowed into the
sand

  that shot saved rosemonde but a
heavy body hurtled out and fell full
upon desmond as he lay rosemonde
taken off guard by the sudden outleap
into action not yet comprehending the
amazing swiftness of desmonds shot
stood above the dead man staring at
the twisting figures before her she
could not tell which was friend which
enemy

  the sense of smell the faint raw
scent of opium told desmond that the
man above him was a manchu his
pistol was useless his arm gripped by
the mans knees he doubled up and a
knife scraped past his side before
the blow could be repeated desmond
got his hand about the yellow neck
jerked the man forward across his
body and wrenched himself sideways

  this freed his pistol arm but he did
not fire instead as he squirmed up
over the yellow man he struck a queer
oblique blow with the pistol and then
a second after this desmond rose
and shook the sand out of himself
while the throat of the manchu black-
ened in a pool beneath the stars

  its remarkable what ye can do with
a pistol when the front sight is prop-
erly filed said desmond calmly step-
ping toward rosemonde no other as-
sailants were in sight

  oh she gasped slightly youre
not hurt he stabbed-

  ii ny a rien de casse returned des-
mond they say in books that a man
armed with a knife is at a positive dis-
advantage-and its true enough he is
after hes missed his first lunge the
divil of it lies in makin him miss the
first time

  your bullet passed within a foot of
me-after doing its work said rose-
monde

  i know it answered desmond con-
tritely but i could not help it ye
see if you had not been here i could

have attended to those fellows very
decently but havin to protect you as

well as meself-

  could you feel better then if i re-
turned to camp demanded rose-
monde

  heaven forgive me for sayin it but
i would not that i think ye need
protection mind but for me own peace
of soul because youre the most dis-
tracting person i ever met fairy mis-
tress and-

  very well she broke in turning
abruptly she started back along the
shore

  desmond looked after and rubbed
his chin thoughtfully she might be
angry over her dismissal but there was
no help for it he now wanted to take
action upon his own account and was
relieved that rosemonde had returned

  he was wondering why two of the
manchus and no more had been here
also what had become of their boat
his shot seemed to have attracted no
attention it might or might not have
been heard through the sullen but
heavy booming of the surf for ten
minutes desmond cautiously skirted the
trees hearing nothing the place
might have been an island of the dead
but he knew very well that it was noth-
ing of the kind no moon was up but
the sky was clear as blue-black crystal
and under it the starlit waters and reef
and beach-a rare beauty in it that
clutched at desmonds throat the la-
goon black yet faintly radiant with
phosphorescence the peculiar sheen of
the foaming reef like greenish-white
jade the opalescent coral dust of the
beach where the very sands leaped and

quivered with invisible tropic life-

  damnation take it i say

  the words leaped out in front of
desmond like a bomb he halted
crouched low waited

  whats his game huh it was
baldersons voice now followed by a
crashing of leaves he gives us a


the opium ship

gun all right why whats him
and desmond planning

  a light broke upon the listener so
osullivan had slipped off had carried
balderson one of his pistols why
desmond laughed softly to himself
plainly perceiving the fiddlers strategy
osullivan had been thinking also of
arevalos money-the chest which was
acting as a pot of honey to flies-and
had provided balderson with an aid
toward the killing of the manchus
balderson was set upon killing no
doubt of this

  dunno cme a more sullen voice
king and billy are down to the south
end lookin for the boat the chinks
are lookin too

  there was nothing at desmonds
camp huh  queried balderson

  nothin responded the other
one o them wimmen was stirring
so i didnt stay their boats there
but not the other one we can grab
theirs at a pinch i guess

  balderson rumbled his viking laugh
not until daylight tom-not until
daylight that man desmond will be
watching huh takes no chances
too many surprises waitin at night
but in the daytime you can see what
youre doing find the chink you
knifed huh

  no growled the other but i got
him right-plumb in the guts who
was that shootin over here

  dunno said balderson king
maybe or billy the chinks are all
split up tryin to find their blasted boat
where in hell is that chest gone huh 

  if wed known earlier that they
didnt have no guns to mention said
tom wed ha played hell with em
but that yellow devil bluffed us with
his slimy talk maybe they sneaked
that chest out to the schooner balder-
son

  huh  the big vikings voice was
startled and bovinely thoughtful
mebbe so tom mebbe so hadnt

thought of it blieve ill swim me out
there and see huh we know there
aint none aboard its like them chinks
to take the chest out and stick her
someers huh  hide her away then
they come ashore with some dope and
their boat gets lost come night damn
queer huh

  guess ill swim out there with you
said tom two can look bettern
one

  crouching lower against the sand
desmond saw the two black shapes
against the stars passing within a few
yards of him there was nothing to
be feared from balderson for the pres-
ent obviously

  its cleared up most amazing all but
the loss o the boat reflected desmond-
all hands seem to be puzzled by that
thunder o finn why didnt i think
of it meself if it was michael ter-
ence now who stole that boat hes
a genius thats why there were only
two of the manchus back there the
prince has split up his men searching
for the boat and hes ashore some-
where to the south of here and inland
also the treasure chest is lost like most
of em are sooner or later but its
not aboard the wreck its close to
wherever prince chin himself is and
to think of the amazing divil having
maybe two or three guns no more but
bluffing all of us with his power

  turning abruptly into the trees he
headed across the island there was
little undergrowth the trees were
mostly of good size the island being
too low and storm-swept to admit of
small growths consequently des-
mond found the progress easier than
he had anticipated the starlight aiding
him greatly

  again and again he paused vainly
listening for some guiding sound
there was no sign of a fight or camp
fire prince chan was lying perdu-
where where was the fiddler that
mad lovable half-dying irishman
the opium ship



  with the uncanny sharpening of the
perceptions that comes with night and
darkness desmond felt a sound he
heard nothing but the slight almost
noiseless vibration of the air that
touched his ear was carried to his
brain and he halted instantly now the
sound recurred and he stood very mo-
tionless holding down even his breath-
ing he sensed danger and sensed it
close at hand

  not from the sound however he
had already recognized that as the
hacking cough of osullivan it was
somewhere among the trees not far
distant-but it was muffled nearly to
nothing then as he stood listening he
caught the timbre of a voice on the
night no words just the formless tone
but he also recognized that as the voice
of prince chan the manchu

  ah a shadow materialized ten feet
from him  a man was approaching him
silently a blot against the stars des-
mond crouched low moving an inch at
a time then crouched in absolute still-
ness the dark figure came to within
three feet of him and the flowing
blouse betokened one of the manchus
but not prince chan for an instant
desmond saw the face but the man
turned about listening as he stood
turned thus desmond rose and reached
out with his reversed automatic there
was no sound beyond the slight thud

  catching the senseless man as he fell
desmond searched him rapidly he
found two knives heavy affairs with
brutal steel-and-sharkskin handles and
took these but no pistol the man was
a sentry somewhere beyond here was
prince chan desmond delayed long
enough to bind the man with strips of
his own clothing then rose and stepped
forward he had no doubt that osul-
livan was with the manchu prince

  five minutes afterward desmond
came upon the object of his quest a
treeless hollow ten yards across
opened in front of him a faint whiff

of wood smoke told him that there had
been a camp fire here during the day
although it was now extinct the black
figures of four men showed themselves

  prince chan was speaking in eng-
lish his words carrying softly but dis-
tinctly 

  if he coughs then muffle him he
cannot help the cough but if he tries
to call out stab him at once you un-
derstand perfectly my man

  divil fly away with you i do an-
swered the voice of osullivan

  desmond aided by the voices dis-
tinguished that the fiddler was lying
down probably bound while prince
chan and two more manchus sat be-
side him

  will ye be giving me some dry
clothes now  queried osullivan a
shiver in his tone its a dying man

i am unless-

  you have been for a little swim
came the purring oriental voice it
was you who stole that boat 

  yes it was retorted osullivan
defiant now and shes gone where
yell not get her again since i took her
out beyont the reef on the ebb tide
there was an interval of silence fol-
lowed by an exchange of low conver-
sation among the manchus prince
chan again reverted to english a
smooth menace in his voice

  you did this by desmonds order
my man

  sure  did said osullivan auda-
ciously did we not discover what ye
planned to do with us so we joined
in with balderson if ye want to know
the truth of it

  and balderson has been killing my
men to-night

  i hope to hell he kills the whole pot
of ye v

  oh prince chan laughed softly
terribly and what do you expect me
to do to you

  osullivan did not answer

  at the edge of the clearing desmond
the opium ship

took one of the two heavy knives and
drew back his arm with a flirt of his
wrist he sent the knife high in air
clear over the glade to fall with a
tinkling clatter among the trees on the
other side the clearing

chapter xi
off 

a t the sound occasioned by the fall-
ing knife the three manchus
leaped upright but desmond had
already hurled the second knife this
time far to the right among the trees
as it crashed through the branches
desmond spoke unconcernedly and
coolly

  all set balderson very well
dont any of you fire until i give the
word because i want a little talk with
the prince dont move now prince
chan youre covered three ways

  from the prostrate osullivan came
a long breath like a deep sigh

  there fell a momentary silence
broken again by desmond s voice

  cut my friend loose prince then
you step this way and well have a chat
dont worry about the wet clothes
michael terence the salt water wont
hurt if it dries on you

  one of the standing figures stooped
a moment later osullivan rose
stretching himself

  what about that gun o mine he
inquired

  prince chan will give it to you
then come over here

  here is your weapon said the
prince smoothly the fiddler took it
and sauntered toward desmond be-
hind him followed the prince until
desmond halted him

  thatll do me friend now sup-
pose ye tell us what was in that chest
of arevalos mr balderson thinks
there was money to be had and hes
uneasy

money  repeated prince chan

staring at the spot where desmond
stood yes there was something
like two hundred thousand dollars in
american notes

  and wheres the chest now

  the voice of the manchu rose in
querulous shrill rage

  may the gods curse you it was
made fast under the stern of the boat

which this man set adrift-

  none o your lies snapped des-
mond angrily how could a boat be

drawn up ashore-

  holy mackerel gasped osullivan
now standing beside desmond its
the truth he speaks sir-divil take me
for a fool the boat was anchored
a few feet out from shore and i no-
ticed that she dragged in the water like
-oh murder and to think o me set-
tin her adrift an all mhuire as
truagh on me for a fool 

  this astounding intelligence put a
damper upon desmond he had in-
tended to put prince chan under re-
straint then to lie in wait for balderson
as the latter swam back from the wreck
and after this to dictate terms now
however he had nothing left to fight
for the incentive was removed

  to take away any opium would be
folly since the stuff was contraband
everywhere and he had no ambitions to
smuggle it arevalos chest was an-
other matter however it was lawful
loot and now it was floating somewhere
out upon the bosom of the deep care-
fully set adrift by osullivan

  i could take a boot to ye michael
terence said desmond severely but
i will not twas all innocently ye
acted and for the best leaning over
he put his lips to the ear of the fiddler
back to camp with ye as fast as legs
will carry you me lad wake the
ladies and get the stuff into the boat
well have to get out of this in a hurry
run and look out for balderson he
was over at the wreck last i saw of
him
the opium ship



  osullivan chuckled to himself then
faded into the background

  ill not bother ye further prince
said desmond i believe its the truth
youre telling about the money serves
you right for hiding it from me the
wreck is yours so make the most of it

as for balderson-

  may the tenth hell swallow you 
cried out prince chan sudden intuition
giving him the truth of desmonds ruse

  turning the prince ran furiously
across the clearing toward the point at
which the supposed balderson was con-
cealed desmond laughed seeing the
two other manchus join their prince
as the three reached the opposite trees
however there was the flash and sharp
report of a shot desmond felt the
wind of the bullet

  ah ye would ye slick divil he
firfcd and again then whirling he
set back toward the beach at a run
ignorant whether his bullets had
reached a mark

  therell be the divil to pay now and
no mistake he reflected as he steered
a devious course among the tres our
boat is the only one available and all
three sides will want it whoever gets
it first will stand a chance o finding
the other boat she cant be far off

now-

  he had come to the edge of the trees
and there he paused startled by the
scene before him where the white sand
stretched down to the lagoon

  rising out of the waters edge were
two figures and foremost of them was
balderson about his tangle of hair
had been wrapped his pistol belt and
he looked like some wild poseidon up-
heaved by the sea his great beard drip-
ping over his chest

  balderson desmond started for-
ward get to cover you fool the yel-
low men are after me hot i shot two
of em ive no love for ye but unless
ye want to be murdered look out for
yourselves-

 balderson and his companion
promptly rushed for shelter of the trees

desmond slipped off to the left con-
fident that for the moment they would
not trouble him and then took to his
heels

  it was his hope to get clear away
from the island without further en-
counters as soon as balderson dis-
covered the boat to be gone entirely
there would ensue a three-cornered
fight for possession of desmonds craft
and desmond meant to get away be-
fore prince chan could gather his men
for an attack the money was a sec-
ondary affair

  michael terence certainly put his
foot in it to-night he reflected as he
ran to steal the boat was a prime
notion but the lad went a step too far
then the chest of money under her stem
settled everything if we can get off
we might pick up the other boat our-
selves but for the sake o the ladies
well get off

  when he reached the camp he found
osullivan hustling their supplies back
into the boat and rosemonde emerging
to lend a hand a moment later dona
juliana left the shelter which desmond
promptly stripped from its supports

  ive no time to be talkin now he
exclaimed hurriedly roll down the
boat michael terence a minutes de-
lay may mean all of us with our throats
cut

  the two men shoved the boat at the
water the women watching in silent
anxiety then with the last of the
dunnage loaded in desmond left the
fiddler to hold the craft while he re-
turned for the ladies he picked up
dona juliana with a word of apology
for his haste and waded out with her
to the bow but rosemonde had fol-
lowed careless of the knee-deep water
and was climbing into the stem sheets
before desmond could assist her

  all right michael terence ex-
claimed desmond as he clambered in
the opium ship

straight out to the reef me lad
theres an opening in it almost opposite
us quick now

  at each instant he expected to hear
bullets singing out from shore but the
long oars urged the boat out toward the
reef and there was no alarm the
island remained black and silent while
he rowed desmond gave a brief expo-
sition of the situation for the benefit
of his companions

  easy up now he admonished
osullivan the reef opening is just
ahead miss juliana will you have the
kindness to lean over the bow and keep
watch for rocks well have to watch
over our shoulders and may miss a few
all right michael terence-pull

  the oars dipped and gripped the
boat roared down into a hollow between
the seas her bottom scraped then she
was ascending the next sea with a surg-
ing hiss of foam and with two strokes
they were out beyond the reef

thank the saints muttered des-
mond now let em fire all they wish
where did ye leave that boat me lad 
what boat  demanded rosemonde
knowing nothing of the treasure

  the other one and desmond
laughed softly pull ahead michael
terence she cant be far away-
down near the other reef opening most-
like keep watch for an empty boat
ladies 

  the ladies made no response the
island had become formless a vague
black shape which closed sea and sky
and which was still entirely devoid of
any light or sound

  desmond knew that the other boat
could not have drifted far being high
in the water the set of the wind would
naturally hold her back toward the reel
as would the attraction of the land
besides it was unlikely that osullivan
had taken her far out as he confessed
himself to be no great swimmer and had
been afraid to venture far

  i see something called juliana

softly from the bow off to the left

something black on the water-

  right added desmond getting a
glimpse of the thing himself he felt
no strong excitement over the possibil-
ity of finding the treasure merely a
laughing recklessness money of itseu
meant too little to him for the thought
to rule in his mind

  now ahead of us cried dona juli-
ana quickly be careful-

  they slid down a long wave and
with a final tug on his oar desmond
sent them alongside an empty boat that
loomed suddenly from the darkness
he rose and pulled the other craft
around until he could get at its stem

  ah there was a rope cunningly
fastened-and another from them a
square box no large affair this only
a box two feet by one of narra or iron-
wood getting a secure grip upon a
handle which his fingers encountered
desmond cut the lines with his knife
and hauled the box aboard

done he exclaimed tossing it at
the fiddlers feet well open it by

daylight me lad-

  whats in it asked rosemonde
ah thats a surprise desmond
chuckled eh michael terence a
bit of a surprise if our luck holds good
get the mast and sail out o that boat
now well leave em this canvas for

ive no time to be bothered with it-

  see here exclaimed osullivan
who was trembling with mingled cold
and excitement is it goin to leave
them the other boat ye are and where
are we goin to anyhow

  desmond laughed going dye
know that by to-morrow night welt
reach the mainland or before coast
o china michael terence whether its
french china or the real thing i dont
know nor care sure well be leavin
them this boat let em fight for it if
they can swim out and get it all
aboard now catch this spar and sail
the opium ship



  were going out to sea and to
china demanded dona juliana awe
in her voice

  were nearly to china now mo
cuisle returned desmond with infec-
tious gayety and by to-morrow
night praise be well have finished the
trip

  but these waves-these mountains

of water-

  sure theyre just mountains of
water and whos afraid of water get
ye some dry clothes michael terence
rosemonde have ye dry stockings and
shoes then well give you and miss
juliana the fore part o the craft once
we get the sail up and youll have the
best going in the way o privacy fairy
mistress of me heart to work mi-
chael terence

  as he dragged the mast and sail from
the other boat he uttered a sharp ex-
clamation and paused suddenly from
the dark line of the island came the crack
of a pistol close upon this came a sec-
ond shot and then silence again

  when the dawn lightened over para-
cel island bringing the reef and shore
and trees into faint relief against the
dark western sky it showed a dark
head bobbing out beyond the reef this
bobbing head approached a larger black
mass floating upon the waves and
merged with it

  meantime aboard the wreck of the
schooner three men were busily en-
gaged packing a common seamans
chest with small gaudily labeled tins
as the dawn lightened they broke off
work at a hail from the shore it was
prince chan who hailed and balderson
stood in the rigging to make answer
what you want huh

  weve found the boat answered
the manchu

  an oath fell from balderson got
the chest did you 

the boat floating throw in the opium
and well take you into partnership

  hell spake one of the three men
to balderson whatll he do with the
dope 

  answer quickly floated the suave
voice of the prince we must leave
at once we have sighted the sail of
desmonds boat and he is heading due
west we can dispose of the opium
if we reach the french-china coast
but only in small quantities

  throw in with em advised the
man king they got billy but we
got a few of them to even up theres

seven of them and three of us lets

     ft

  all right boomed baldersons
voice bring your boat along and load
up we agree

  half an hour later the boat under
a sail rigged by baldersons deft hands
bore out from paracel island and
rounded the southern end sunrise was
breaking in the boat were crowded
seven manchus and the three white
men amidships was the seamans
chest with its load of five-tael opium
tins

  the morning was half gone when
as the boat topped a great wave bal
derson stood erect in the stern and
gazed westward

  after em he cried his yellow
beard afloat in the wind well not
catch up huh but well be on their
heels

  thats very good said prince
chan smiling thinly the money will
be easily divided- and the women
will-

  i want the one we agreed on re-
member scowled balderson

  of course agreed the suave man-
chu and i want the other one cer-
tainly 

  the two men grinned each at the
other and balderson reflected that
chinks were human beings after all

no desmond had taken it and left

to re concluded
perhaps you have seen vernon
shelley on the screen starring in
the numerous comedies and
dramas released by the peerless fea-
ture film corporation if so you
probably remember some of the other
principals in that famous celluloid crew
notably dolly cameron the delicious
ingenue monty field the dudish juve-
nile and roy hedges the keen-eyed
villain all of whom appeared with shel-
ley in his greatest picture the crystal
ball which portrayed the actual melo-
drama following his discharge by the
peerless boss marcus rosenstein

  near the peerless studio are the
plaza apartments where resided shel-
ley and monty and bachelor quarters
presided over by their japanese friday
toyo on the morning after shelley
found himself out of a job monty
dashed in like a charge of cavalry

  see here old man he demanded
excitedly whats this i hear about you
and rosenstein

  all true admitted shelley he
canned me and now hes afraid i wont

pay back the money i had borrowed
from his company can you beat it

  monty tried to register sympathy
deuced luck ill say vern are you
really up against it 

  shelley pointed to the table look
at that stack of unpaid bills as tall as
the wool worth building take it from
me monty the candle shouldnt be
burned at both ends

  anything i can do for you

  yes find me a fortune that needs
an owner

  do anything for you vern buck
up old man the first hundred years
of life are the hardest they say

  with this optimistic advice monty
slapped shelley on the back and went
out the door just as toyo entered with
the mail which consisted of several
more reminders of indebtedness

  good morning friday mumbled
shelley without looking up from the
morning paper bringing more trou-
ble i suppose any one call for me
last night while i was out

  not very much sir stammered
the crystal ball



toyo in his best english was only
some newspaper gentlemans and the
gentleman rosenstein and more other
stranger gentlemans

  that all laughed his master
well i wasnt expecting the united
states army not much chance of get-
ting lonesome when im that popular

  toyo laughed too being sufficiently
americanized to know that employers
jokes must at all times be appreciated
then the doorbell rang and toyo re-
sponded like a fire horse when the gong
sounds with a quick important walk
entered the unwelcome mr rosenstein
a fat dark little jew with a goatee and
many dazzling diamonds that flashed in
his red necktie

  i suppose you know what i am here
for proceeded rosenstein frowning
portentously and you must also know
that it is up to you to settle your obli-
gations

  im aware of the fact shelley ac-
knowledged as calmly as he could do
you know of any one looking for a
sober reliable janitor

  young man i mean business
snapped the creditor beating his fists
together irritably do you realize you
owe a sum of money that you havent
got

  sit down mr rosenstein i have a
proposition to offer

  i tell you i will not consider any
sort of a compromise broke in rosen-
stein his hands twitching a fifty-
fifty split wont tempt me so youre
wasting time

  every outburst of his effervescent
guest amused shelley the more
why said he no one mentioned a
compromise that was only a trick
of your active imagination now listen
here i intend to pay every cent i owe
you with interest for every moment i

retain it that ought to-

  preferring to use his tongue more
than his ears rosenstein could not keep
atb

still didnt i tell you he snapped
that promises will not pay debts
yes returned shelley it was well
put and i dont blame you for feeling
proud of it but now see here mr
rosenstein the only way i can pay
you is by borrowing elsewhere and that
of course will take some little time so
if you will return to-night say about
nine the full amount will be waiting
here for you

  no refused the creditor shaking
his head vigorously i will not return
because i have decided not to leave
by to-night you would be in china or
australia

  such traveling hasnt been in-
vented shelley assured him youd
better think over my proposition before
answering

  rosenstein did think it over his
eyes fell on the closed door then on
the young mans determined expression
and forthwith he realized that this was
his only opportunity jerking a small
notebook from his pocket he began
to figure zealously his face took on
a wry look as if he were swallowing
a pill which did not taste pleasant

  very well he concluded springing
to his feet ill agree to that let me
out you may expect me at nine sharp
and i shall not be alone

  shelley was pleased yet perplexed
he knew that nine oclock would roll
around very quickly and that when
one is in debt raising money is like
raising polar bears on the equator

  ill do my best to have the money
ready for you he said opening the
door and showing the dapper gentle-
man out but if you receive any other
invitations for to-night dont let my
engagement interfere any other
night will do just as well

  youll see me to-night without fail
and i wont be put off again good
day

  shelley closed the door behind him
and returned to his chair where he sat


the crystal ball

excavating in his collection of financial
worries while thus morosely en-
gaged monty the cheerful cherub re-
turned like a ray of purest sunshine
as the poet would relate bearing glad
tidings of untold wealth in store for
a poor moneyless motion-picture actor
known professionally as vernon shel-
ley

  to be more explicit monty was so
crazy with excitement that he seized
his dazed pal and began dancing around
the room like an almost human chim-
panzee

  congratulations vem old man he
kept repeating great news youre
a rich man

  see here monty whats eating on
you demanded shelley breaking
loose

  monty thrust a crumpled newspaper
at him and commanded read that
page two fourth column

  one glance at the paper was enough
to short circuit shelleys thought gen-
erator and give him a sudden yearning
to sit down there was a chair beside
the reading table but he missed it
by several inches because the whole
pesky universe had begun whirling
jubilant monty gathered him up and
held the incredible news before his be-
wildered gaze above shelleys pic-
ture was the heading movie star
likely heir to langland fortune
the rest was a blur to the prospective
heir

  see old man explained monty it
says your old aunt has told the world
she wont leave you a cent to blow for
wild oats but if youre married and
settled down you get all the coin instead
of her servants getting it see  seems
shes strong for double harness and
now she aint expected to live only a
few hours so its up to you to find a
mate  d q

  shelley had completely revived he
read the article over three times with-
out stopping for breath and sighed

sweet music from heaven it seemed
like a moving-picture plot instead of
the real thing he had inherited many
film fortunes but none of said for-
tunes had affected him like this one

  monty walloped him on the shoulder
gad vern youre a lucky cuss ill
say how many millions is it
enough to marry dolly and keep
the wolf away guessed shelley

  but vern if you marry and then
your old aunt recovers therell be the
devil to pay eh old man

  and rosenstein added shelley
and immediately rushed out the door
bareheaded

  its a good half mile from the plaz
to dolly camerons dressing room at
the studio and shelleys record for the
distance would remain immortal had it
been recorded out of breath he
knocked at her door and called big
news dolly can i see you 

  the door opened quickly and he
stepped into a small room littered with
costumes and cosmetics before a large
mirror the peerless ingenue was busily
making up as a japanese geisha girl

  stop look listen he ordered ex-
citedly draping himself over the cor-
ner of her dressing table big sur-
prise dolly rich millions

  at the word millions she dropped
her work whos rich vernon

  i am aint it funny millions
can you beat it 

  dolly laughed a millionaire ac-
tor dont make me laugh when im
made up

  all i have to do is marry and the
moneys mine dolly

  oh youre going to marry an heir-
ess she suggested

  no no dolly youre no heiress
but who would give you a million
dollars to marry me vernon

  he showed her the wonderfully ab-
sorbing news item

  dolly he asked after she had fin-
ished reading do you remember what
the crystal ball



i whispered to you when you were

holding my hand in that red cross
hospital scene remember

  and you almost made me spoil the
picture naughty boy

  well i meant every word of it
dolly and a lot more besides hon-
estly dolly im crazy about you and
every time i see you it gets worse
but youre sitting in my cold
cream she interrupted laughing

  without heeding he drew closer to
the eyes hair and teeth which photo-
graphed more perfectly than any in
filmdom

  what dyou say little girl he
grasped her hand will you have
me

  she gave him her other hand too
of course id have you if i could i
think more of you than any man ver-
non but i cant have anybody now
you know old cross-patch rosenstein
thinks the public loses interest in an
actress when she marries so he put it
in my contract that i must stay single
rosenstein be darned exclaimed
shelley what does a millionaires
wife need with a job

  but i cant give up my career ver-
non ive struggled for it all my life
and i love it-love it more than any-
thing else in the world

  he released her hands with disap-
pointment yes i suppose it is ask-
ing too much of you he admitted it
means a fortune to me but i guess i
can manage it some other way

  the telephone rang and monty in-
formed him that a telegram was wait-
ing for him but it did not have to
wait long for shelley dropped the tele-
phone and departed

  six oclock that evening found shel-
ley on the verge of committing matri-
mony he was sitting in the twilight
silently contemplating this desperate
act when monty blew in like a gust
of wind carrying his golf equipment
and a smile which little showed that

he had lost a half dozen balls in as

many drives

  just in time shelley declared sit
down i have something to tell you
monty obeyed go ahead im the
best little listener that ever listened
if you didnt talk so much added
shelley as a truthful joke keep this
to yourself did you pass any one
leaving as you came in

  montys ears pricked no old
man who was it

  a young lady whom i just proposed
to shes to return soon to marry me
the listener leaned forward with in-
terest another eh said he gad
vern whats the matter with dolly
cant marry until her contract ex-
pires my aunts worse so what the
deuce could i do but find a wife a
pretty little lady called selling encyclo-
pedias and i told her my plight she
fell for me hard and like a fool i
proposed to her shes a very young
widowed orphan named laura par-
sons

  thats interesting exclaimed
monty deuced interesting sounds
like a book romance you know when
will she be back

  as soon as she can pack a satchel
replied shelley surprised at his own
actions then well be married at
once you must stick around and meet
her

  monty objected that he was not look-
ing fit but stayed nevertheless after
he had asked a million questions and
shelley had put his packed suit case
beside the door in readineses they
drifted back to the den and passed the
time while waiting by playing a few
uninteresting hands at pinochle shel-
leys mind was no more on the cards
he held than on the north pole so for
once in his life monty was not
swamped a little before eight oclock
toyo broke up the game by announcing
that miss parsons was in the librarv


the crystal ball

  you know old man said monty
three is a crowd you go on in and
have your tete-a-tete then when you
are ready to leave call me really i
dont feel presentable in these knee-
breeched things feel awfully like a
plagued chorus man

  shelley agreed rather than argue
and hastened to the library alone en-
tering he stopped abruptly in the door-
way his senses incredulous of what his
eyes beheld for the young woman
instead of sitting ladylike in her chair
was crouched over in the corner by the
bookcase her back was turned so that
she did not see him for several seconds
silently he stood watching as she drew
a large volume from the shelf and hid
behind it a small morocco jewel case
which she took from her bodice then
with a heavy step he advanced to ap-
prise her of his presence

  thats not a very safe place to con-
ceal your valuables he said evenly
better let me put them in the wall
safe

  instantly she returned the treasure
to her person and whirled about oh
she exclaimed very excited and some-
what cowed never mind bothering
ill just carry it with me its only
a little keepsake that my husband
brought from the war you know he
was an english army officer and was
killed in flanders

  she talked rapidly as if fearing that
he would ask some questions her
rather young face was flushed and her
quavering voice had all the petulance
of an emotional actress she was neatly
and plainly dressed in such clothes as
a wealthy ladys maid might wear

  surely you are too young to have
married before the war said shelley
puzzled by her uneasiness

  what was i thinking about  she
corrected herself nervously my hus-
band died of-of pneumonia just after
the war ended

  pneumonia mused shelley only

half convinced what month did you

say 

  let me see she moistened her
lips and twisted her interlocked fingers
strange i cant remember that the
date of his death seems to have slipped
my mind completely

  perhaps it doesnt matter just now
said he throwing off that matter in
order to broach another pm afraid
i am a very inquisitive rascal how
did you ever think of hiding your keep-
sake behind a row of books

  she became still more ill at ease
ive often done it mr shelley dont
let the thing annoy you its only a
trifle are you all packed for our
honeymoon 

  yes was his subconscious reply as
he strove to conceal his growing sus-
picions

  she stepped closer overly impatient
when do we start mr shelley

  as a matter of fact he was feeling
less like starting every moment though
she was undeniably pretty and the
thought of rosenstein and his aunt
told him to hurry we must leave
at once miss parsons but first hadnt
you better let me put your keepsake
in the safe

  again she lost her composure its
of so little importance that ill just
carry it thank you

  valuables are an awful nuisance
when traveling he warned her if
you wish ill promise not even to open
it

  after considering a moment she sur-
prised him by handing it over watching
the door as she did so just as he took
it the front doorbell rang he had no
idea who it could be quickly he asked
laura parsons to step into the adjoin-
ing room to wait which she did re-
luctantly

  the morocco case was very heavy to
be so small and as he attempted to
put it into his pocket it fell to the floor
and burst open picking it up he
the crystal ball



beheld a handful of jewelry nestled glit-
teringly in the purple satin lining of
the case there were rings brooches
lavallieres and one immense ball-shaped
diamond strung on a rope of pearls
the latter stone was different from
anything he had ever seen in that every
color of the rainbow was visible deep
down at the center of the white crystal

  he hastened back to the den to see
what had become of monty at the
sight of the big gem the latters eyes
bulged gad vern whered you get
it  he asked quitting his game of sol-
itaire

  sh not so loud admonished
shelley it belongs to miss parsons
at least she says it does heres the
rest of her plunder i dont know why
it is monty but somehow nearly every-
thing she says strikes me as a lie shes
terribly nervous about something i
was a fool for thinking i could marry
a stranger and forget dolly confound
it monty what should i do with her

  dont come to me old man you
know that im a muddle-brained chap
anything id tell you to do would be
the worst thing

  now that shes on my hands i dont
know what the devil to do with her
sighed shelley placing the treasure in
his pocket theres another caller
waiting to see me monty come and
sit in i may make use of you

  after depositing his willing aid be-
hind the draperies in the alcove just
off the library he went in to greet
whoever the-newcomer might be the
first thing to meet his eyes was the
muzzle of a diminutive pearl-handled
revolver it was aimed directly at his
head by a pale-faced sad-eyed young
woman in handsome mourning she
stood about in the center of the room
a composed stately creature with coal-
black hair and pompous virile move-
ments

  hands up she commanded in a
melancholy voice

  cannons are unnecessary here
madam he assured her after he had
found his voice if i were the worst
criminal outside the penitentiary i
wouldnt harm a guest in my own home
have a chair

  put up your hands or  fire she
insisted and he humored her whats
your name

  vernon shelley whats this-a
holdup game who are you anyway
ethel edgeworth widow of the late
lord edgeworth son and heir of wil-
liam albert edgeworth earl of ken-
brook replied the lady in black the
murderer of my husband is hidden here
i have traced the crystal ball to your
door

  this bit of startling information
caused montys head which was lis-
tening close to the draperies to hit the
wall with a thud shelleys eyes stared
unseeingly although he had met sev-
eral titled ladies none had ever before
honored him with a visit

  sorry lady edgeworth he said
but i dont understand what you are
talking about ive never made a prac-
tice of cultivating the friendship of
murderers and i dont know whether
the crystal ball is a race horse or a
parlor car

  her expression never altered the
crystal ball she explained is a large
ball-shaped diamond which is famous
all over europe because of the mis-
fortunes that have always befallen its
owners since it was mined many
years ago by maharajah pandukurah
a hindu potentate it has been stolen
eighteen times and has caused seven
murders

  again montys head thumped the
wall the unlucky thing in shelleys
pocket seemed suddenly to burn against
his body he was strongly inclined to
throw it out the window lest it should
bring him some ill luck they sat down
now opposite one another the little
weapon lying in her lap


the crystal ball

  six months ago she continued with
difficulty my husband fell heir to the
valuable stone just a week ago he was
murdered in his bed both his body
and the jewel case disappeared and
have not been seen since that night on
the same night a man and his wife
who had been our servants since we
came to america a year ago also dis-
appeared naturally they were sus-
pected of the crime but the authorities
were unable to apprehend them so i
offered a reward of twenty-five thou-
sand dollars and undertook the task
myself

  well what do you want here
asked shelley fumbling with the pre-
cious thing in his pocket my time is
limited to-night

  the crystal ball is here she said
her drooping eyes surveying every cor-
ner of the room with catlike quickness
i happened to pick up the trail from
a pawnbroker and now i have followed
it here

  see here demanded shelley very
much puzzled are you a real titled
lady did all this actually happen or
did you read it somewhere sounds
to me like a movie

  certainly i am lady edgeworth
she declared in hurt tones and i
intend to search for my husbands mur-
derer till death

  well lady edgeworth you dont
accuse me of murder and burglary do
you

  not unless you have the crystal
ball she told him her melancholy
eyes fixed on him relentlessly i am
quite positive some one has it here
you wont object if my detective
searches the place will you 

  immediately he felt the blood leave
his face in the alcove monty almost
fell off his chair shelley was unde-
cided whether to give her the treasure
right then or to question the thief again
and attempt to win the fat reward his

eyes chanced to fall on the clock and
brought him to his feet instantly

  whatever you do he said please
be brief about it my aunt is dying and
i must leave town as soon as possible

  her features betrayed her suspicions
very well she agreed i shall sum-
mon my assistant and begin the search
at once

  the next moment the tension was
tightened by the sound of the doorbell
shelley breathed harder

  ah another caller he exclaimed
lady edgeworth ill have to ask you
to postpone your search for a few
minutes monty he called louder
come and show the lady into the next
room

 trembling perceptibly monty
stepped forth with his eyes glued al-
ways on the revolver which she was
putting in her mesh bag then he as-
sumed the guise of butler and led her
out returning immediately in feverish
excitement

  gad vern what are you going to
do with it he whispered hadnt
you better call the police were go-
ing to get ourselves in a lot of trouble

  what said shelley call the po-
lice so they can get the twenty-five
thousand not on your life monty
if that woman is what she says she is
and knows what shes talking about
then the parsons woman is the wife
of the murderer by questioning her
we ought to be able to find her hus-
band that may be him at the door
now

  monty trembled still more but
vera he quavered breathlessly a
wad of money wont do us any good
after were full of bullet holes a
woman that wants revenge is liable to
do anything shes so blamed serious
she gives me the creeps

  aw calm yourself admonished
shelley holding the beautiful jewel up
to the light theres nothing to get
excited about go back and sit in the
the crystal ball



alcove until i need you when i yell
you come understand 

  no no vern whispered monty
as pale as a ghost listen here man
we dont know anything about catching
murderers i never saw one in my
life if he would kill one man hed
kill more you can have the reward
vern i dont want it my life is worth
more than the coin so dont call on me
shelley smiled and put the treasure
box back in his pocket monty do
you believe all this crystal ball story
sure dont you

  confound it i dont know whether
to or not sounds awfully far-fetched
if it didnt fit so well with this ball-
shaped diamond id think the woman
was one of those cranks who imagine
they are somebody else

  monty looked like a scared hare
cranks are dangerous vern take it
from me shes too dangerous to fool
with

  you were cut out for a soldier de-
clared shelley sarcastically but you
ought not to dislike the woman she
saved me from that parsons girl i
was badly fooled monty the girl
looks more like a queen than a crook
they are both dangerous vern i
wouldnt trust either of them behind
my back and i woulnt touch that un-
lucky hunk of cracked ice for a thou-
sand dollars monty rubbed a nerv-
ous hand across his brow seven mur-
ders already just think of it vern
seven i tell you man youd better
send for the police and get rid of this
mess before your aunt dies

  we will get rid of it by ourselves
just as soon as i see who is at the door
said shelley quit confidently can
you believe it monty we hold the key
to a lords murder now hurry back
to your post before our prisoners get
restless

  just as he shoved excited monty
through the draperies into the alcove
toyo approached with a total stranger

   the third addition to the variegated
collection of strangers proved to be a
towering cosmetic blonde with the sky-
blue eyes of a porcelain doll entering
in four strides she spread herself non-
chalantly in the first chair she came to
shelley stood aside scrutinizing her
earnest face her expensive clothes her
large black earrings her rakish hat set
on an abundance of yellow hair he
guessed her age as near thirty

  are we alone she asked imme-
diately

   im afraid so replied shelley who
heartily disliked that melodramatic
question

   before speaking again she cautiously
eyed both doors behind her back
montys frightened face appeared and
disappeared between the draperies like
a full moon on a cloudy night

   mr shelley she proceeded confi-
dentially there is an impostor here-
a woman who is passing herself off
as lady edgeworth in order to secure
a rare diamond which was left by my
husband i am the real lady edge-
worth when the stone is recovered
it belongs to me it is known as the

crystal ball and was stolen when-

   yes interrupted shelley ive
heard all that expect i could even
tell the thief himself several things he
did not know about it lady edge-
worth number one has related the
whole affair

   she was undaunted i want to say
mr shelley that i shall make it very
unpleasant for your friend if she at-
tempts to claim the crystal ball

  my friend he blurted out i
never saw her until to-night so i can
answer for none of her shortcomings
she may be a lady or she may be an
adventuress for all i know

   she is an impostor reasserted the
blonde in her rather husky voice ive
been following her for two days and
now i will settle with her or have a
satisfactory explanation


the crystal ball

  after considering a moment he spoke
up quite frankly say look me in
the eye and tell me the truth are you
stringing me i mean are you the
real lady edgeworth 

  monty marveled at his boldness for
a moment she would not answer you
insult me with such a question she
said loftily its useless to answer
thats exactly what the other one
said he puzzled im overwhelmed
by calls from two distinguished ladies
at once never in my life got into
such a crazy mix-up seems to me
you women have been reading the same
dime novel and you both imagine you
are the violet-eyed heroine

  she ignored his banter where is
the woman who is trying to rob me
she demanded let me see her

  i would much prefer that you two
hold your conference somewhere else
he glanced impatiently at his watch
nothing would please me better than
to stick in the midst of this crystal
ball mix-up but im getting married
to-night

  you shall not shield her hotly de-
clared lady edgeworth number two
let me see her at once

  shield her he exclaimed dont
that into your head i told you i
never saw her before

  if she is not a friend of yours what
is she doing here 

  youll have to ask her about that
she came of her own accord

  let me see the woman she threat-
ened or i shall cause trouble

  well be sure you make it brief i
cant be detained he rose with trep-
idation for he feared the results of
their meeting both were very deter-
mined women and the little pearl-han-
dled weapon was still on his mind

  as he started for her the overworked
doorbell rang quickly he asked the
yellow-haired lady edgeworth to wait
in another room while he received the
latest arrival handing her a maga-

zine to read during the wait he showed
her into a room separate from those
occupied by the other two when he
returned to the library montys head
was peering questioningly from between
the alcove draperies

  gad whos at the door now he
whispered creeping forth

  how do i know responded shel-
ley say which do you think is the
real lady edgeworth 

  that question held no place in
montys mind i must be going to
bed he said with a haunted look
honestly i must vern i feel so
dreadfully out of place in these golf
clothes really old man i must say
good night

  shelley gripped his shoulder aw
youre just scared monty stick
around i think ill need you here
they come get back in there

  as monty disappeared toyo ap-
peared with a chic little lady all snug-
gled in furs at close range shelley
saw that she seemed somewhat older
than he at first supposed that her face
was too thickly powdered her features
hardened by dissipation and her finery
in extremely poor taste he sized her
up immediately for he had been about
city streets after dark enough to rec-
ognize her sort at a glance she was
young in years but old in experience
and appearance

  i want to see the wife of lord
edgeworth she said in a direct fa-
miliar way

  which one he asked jestingly
quit the kidding she reproved
let me see her-the one that has the
crystal ball

  which one owns it he persisted
the yellow-haired one or the black-
haired one

  she looked at him as though he were
crazy i never saw her so i dont
know what kind of hair she has that
dont make any difference all im
after is the diamond
the crystal ball



  how did you know her ladyship
was here

  her maid told me i heard lord
edgeworth was dead and went right
away for the crystal ball heres the
letter from him promising to give it to
me

  she brought out the note but he
made no move to take it see here
said he i dont know a thing about
this affair i wish you would tell me
what you know how does it happen
you have never seen his wife

  there wasnt any use making her
unhappy by letting her know her hus-
band had other women friends she
explained quite openly so lord edge-
worth always kept her in the dark about
me he was strong for the women-
all except his wife he did a lot of
crazy things but he sure knew how
to shell out the coin i ran across him
when he first came to america
shelley was such a confidential lis-
tener that she probably would have told
her full history had he not interrupted
seems to be quite a scramble after
the jewel how much do you suppose
its worth

  she laughed a half-cracked giggle
how much well when little nell
gets it she wont have to worry with
the men any more

  he was very much amused at the
little worldly wise stranger did you
know the crystal ball was stolen he
asked

  she grasped the arm of the chair
with one hand and put the other to
her throat my gawd she gasped
under her breath stolen the crys-
tal ball stolen

  yes he fumbled with it in his
pocket as he spoke even lady edge-
worth does not know where it is she
has offered twenty-five thousand dol-
lars fpr it and the murderer

  twenty-five thousand repeated
nell breathlessly well she is fooled

if she thinks it belongs to her its
mine i have it in writing

  lord edgeworth must have been
very fond of you suggested shelley
i guess so she sighed crestfallen
over the disappearance of the treasure
he was a handsome chap but aw-
ful silly his folks called him a black
sheep because he fell for the women
and roved all over the world instead
of staying at home

  are you positive that the man you
have in mind is lord edgeworth 
asked shelley

  sure she answered he has
often shown me the crystal ball and
told me all about himself

  at that moment the doorbell an-
nounced still another arrival rising
quickly shelley took a few steps to-
ward the doorway

  im sorry the crystal ball has dis-
appeared he said theres nothing
you can do about claiming it until it
is recovered

  contrary to his wishes she did not
leave her chair an inch i want to
see lady edgeworth anyway she
said determinedly ive got to tell
her something

  it was a perplexing moment for this
nell somebody was an embarrassing
guest there was nothing for him to
do but get her out of sight the quick-
est way possible so he asked her to
wait outside and showed her into a
room separate from the other three
his waiting list was growing much
faster than he realized

  returning to the library he found
monty peeping out as before just as
he opened his mouth to say that he had
to go toyo silenced him by bringing
in a wide-awake bright-eyed young
woman with a very businesslike manner
and gait her attire gave immediate
evidence that she was bent more on
bread and butter than anything else

  im dottie dills feature writer for
the star  she said before sitting down
o

the crystal ball

they shook hands im sent mr
shelley to get a few facts and perhaps
an interview concerning your leaving
the peerless feature film corpora-
tion

  sorry not to ask you to have a
chair he said evasively but my time
is completely taken up im leaving
town to-night

  then perhaps you have a recent
photograph to give us she persevered
wwe have several old press-agent ones
at the office but no late ones that do
you justice

  he smiled and handed her a picture
from the table i would gladly tell
you how little i know if i had the time
but there are others waiting to see me

  right here she showed her reporters
pluck if i sit out in the hal until
they leave may i have a few words
with you then she begged

  not knowing what else to dcr he
agreed and sent her triumphantly to
her post at once monty stepped fbrth
from his hiding place

  gad vern isnt this an awful
mess he whispered beyond himself
with excitement

  might be worse i suppose said
shelley who had dropped into a chair
and was trying to think

  be reasonable man begged monty
what will you do if some of those
crazy women get together

  call the coroner replied shelley
still trying to think

  montys face was wrapped in seri-
ousness the whole blasted gang are
liars all they are here for is to rob
us

  well they wont get much con-
soled shelley heres the only treas-
ure on the place look monty isnt
it a beauty

  as he rolled the wonderful ball-
shaped stone on his palm a myriad of
flames flashed in every facet monty
gazed at it like a snake-charmed rabbit

  gad it must be worth several for-

tunes he exclaimed no wonder it
has caused seven murders better turn
it over to the police and get rid of the
whole gang

  which one do you think is the real
lady edgeworth  asked shelley ig-
noring the advice by putting the jewel
away

  none of them quickly answered
monty they are all robbers work-
ing together i dont believe a word
they said

  monty talked on while shelley sat
pondering his chin in his hands and
his elbows on his knees with dolly
rosenstein his aunt and the crystal
ball mystery on his mind there was
considerable mental turmoil he was
all at sea in a high wind and a leaky
boat

  say vern said monty youve
got more on your shoulders than you
can carry what the devil are you
keeping those women here for

  to find the murderer of lord edge-
worth replied shelley plainly go
and bring the one named laura par-
sons in here ill make her tell where
her husband is if she has any and
whether they were ever servants of
lord edgeworth

  as monty left the room to summon
the first witness shelley happened to
notice by the clock that it was exactly
nine the hour that he had told rosen-
stein to return for his money

  then the telephone rang and find-
ing the call was another creditor shel-
ley determined to relieve himself of
further annoyance from these persistent
gentlemen by disconnecting the wires
this he did with his penknife

  at two minutes after nine rosen-
stein and his escort arrived as had
never occurred before toyo failed to
respond to the bell so shelley had the
honor of admitting them himself he
was almost swept off his feet when he
beheld the escort who was a broad-
chested flat-footed police officer with
the crystal ball



an uninviting smile concealing his as-
tonishment he led them immediately
into the library

  as they passed through the hall dot-
tie dills the star reporter who was
sitting inconspicuously in the corner
took a lively interest in the blue coat
and brass buttons instinctively she
dived into her shabby handbag for pad
and pencil in preparation for a story

  shelley very gallantly shoved chairs
at the two visitors but they preferred
to stand hat in hand the glossy apex
of rosensteins bald head being ex-
actly on a level with the shoulders of
his burly aid then the host passed
a box of cigars and again the pair of
sphinxes were unresponsive

  now what can i do for you gentle-
men  he asked with a deferential air

  are you that forgetful exploded
rosenstein red in the face its nine
oclock the hour you set to pay me
thats so calmly observed shel-
ley im very sorry that you find me
unprepared

  then you break your promise
rosenstein was clawing his goatee
you mean you cant pay me
havent had time to borrow the
money mr rosenstein explained
shelley ive been on the jump with
other matters every moment since you
left

  excuses dont pay debts declared
the creditor i will not be put off
again

  my aunt is not expected to live
explained shelley and i am her only
heir she has willed me enough to
pay you several times so you see
you have nothing to worry about

  for business reasons he thought it
best not to mention the marriage pro-
viso they stared at him dubiously

  at that inopportune time monty
who had been sent to fetch laura par-
sons entered with her when they saw
the policeman they were panic-stricken
turning quickly she darted for the

door but her escape was obstructed
by the officers two hundred and fifty
pounds monty was the color of new-
fallen snow his knees almost refusing
to hold him up

  t told you that diamond would get
us in bad vern he cried in a trem-
ulous voice officer i dont know a
blooming thing about these women i
never saw them before i swear i
never

  what diamond  what women 
snapped the brusque officer

  shelley shot a silencing glance at
monty just in time to prevent him from
laying bare all he knew as the lat-
ter shrank back the officer seized his
arm rather roughly

  come on dont hold nothing back
he growled through his coarse black
mustache wheres this diamond
youre talking about

  shelley stepped forward to attempt
to help monty out you see offi-
cer he explained naively hes a for-
eigner and gets his words mixed dont
listen to him

  whos this lady demanded the
officer pointing at laura parsons
guess youll call her a nut too
shelley was too hard pressed even to
appreciate irish wit shes a neighbor
of mine he hastened to reply arent
you laura

  she tried to say yes but was too
frightened to do more than nod her
head monty cringed as far as he
dared away from the two callers who
looked questioningly at each other at
a loss to know what to believe or do
things look suspicious concluded
the officer handing rosenstein a re-
volver you stay here and watch this
bunch while i stroll around a bit
these people are holding back some-
thing and gus murphy is going to find
it

  had gus murphy expected to find
what he found he doubtless would not


the crystal ball

have been so keen for a stroll after
stationing the timid guard in the hall
door he departed toward the rear in
quest of a diamond and some women

  it was a very uneasy crowd he left
behind him in the library rosenstein
was afraid of the weapon in his trem-
bling hand shelley was afraid his aunt
might die laura parsons was afraid
her identity might be discovered and
monty was afraid of his shadow

  in less than a minute the returning
searcher stuck his head in the door
his hair almost standing on ends he
summoned the master of the house

  somebodys murdered he gasped

  every face turned white rosen-
stein dropped his gun as if it were hot
before the officer could give further
instructions the whole pop-eyed crowd
rushed like a pack of hungry buzzards
to find the dead lying lifeless on the
dining-room floor in front of the buffet
they found good old toyo there was
no trace of blood bullet wound or mu-
tilation of any kind he lay in perfect
repose

  it was a heavy blow to shelley like
losing one of his own family he
dashed wildly about the room looking
for some clew but found none with
gus assistance he lifted the body to
the couch in the sitting room while the
group looked on appalled

  then the officer shouldered the re-
sponsibility drew his automatic and
marshaled them in a line on the farther
side of the library from the hall door
reporter dottie dills hearing a com-
motion came in from the hall and was
promptly put in the line of suspects
by this time the women had recognized
each other and were filling the air with
shrill accusations

  that womans husband murdered
my husband declared the black-haired
fiery-eyed lady edgeworth as she
pointed an accusing finger at the par-
sons woman

  murder wheres the murder

gasped dottie dills producing pad and
pencil

  rosenstein and his assistant stared
dum founded at each other the for-
mers knees thumped together equally
as fast as montys the detainment
was not welcomed by shelley who
might have enjoyed seeing the mys-
tery solved had his time not been so
precious

  that woman is an impostor broke
out the stunning blond lady edge-
worth designating the other lady
edgeworth shes trying to rob me by
using my name

  forgery excitedly murmured dot-
tie dills without lifting her head from
her scribbling

  these women are trying to beat me
out of the crystal ball diamond as-
serted the small overly powdered nell
participator in his lordships abundant
crop of wild oats

  robbery again murmured dottie
dills who considered herself by all
odds the luckiest reporter in the world
all save shelley who knew her mis-
sion looked at her as if she was crazy
while she hurriedly turned her scoop
into copy

  the women were all jabbering at
once each demanding that the officer
arrest the other he looked about help-
lessly at what he half believed were a
bunch of idiots

  tell it to the judge he bellowed
gruffly mr rosenstein take this gun
and cover the gang while i call the sta-
tion

  as rosenstein fearfully assumed
control big gus stepped importantly to
the telephone after trying repeatedly
to get central he gave up in despair

  the cussed things out of order
he told rosenstein go to the comer
and call a patrol while i keep these
crooks together

  again shelley shot monty a silencing
glance just in time to prevent him from
explaining that the wires were discon-
the crystal ball



nected rosenstein left in great haste
much relieved to get away from the hot-
bed of crime dottie dills wrote furi-
ously while the other captives looked
deprecatingly at each other all thinking
they had been trapped

  gad vern piped monty are we
going to be arrested

  shelley replied with only a nod as
the officer turned to him a woman
in every room and a dead jap to boot
scoffed the latter spitting through his
scraggy mustache into the fireplace
thought you were in utah huh young
fellow

  i dont know any more about these
people than you do affirmed shelley
like monty here i never saw any of
them until to-night

  then why are they camping in your
flat

 that one-shelley pointed at
laura parsons-came here selling en-
cyclopedias then the rest followed like
sheep all i know aboyt them is just
what they have told you and i doubt
whether half of that is true there
is a mystery somewhere connected with
these lady edgeworths officer and im
willing to do what i can to help you
get at the bottom of it

  talks like an angel spoke up laura
parsons sarcastically officer he is to
blame for all this muddle i came here
as an agent and he proposed to me
then he kept me here until he called
the police but officer fm an inno-
cent woman honest to god i am
ive got my eye on him miss as-
sured husky gus with a confident wink

  he kept me waiting here too
added each of the other three in turn

 and how about you said the
officer to dottie dills

  she looked quickly up from her scrib-
bling i came here to interview mr
shelley but did not expect to find all
this trouble

 reporter ugh blurted gus
well dont forget to mention that it

was officer murphy who made this
haul guess we was both pretty lucky
to drop in on such a big job

  for a while all were quiet it seemed
as if rosenstein had had time to go
several miles gus especially was get-
ting anxious

where did the dead man come
from he asked impatiently munch-
ing a cud of tobacco who was he
dottie dills perked her ears for de-
tails and poised her pencil for action

  dead man  she gasped under her
breath whos dead

  he was our servant explained
shelley stepping forward to lean on
the table when i saw him last just
before you and mr rosenstein came
he was in perfect health so if he
died of an unnatural cause as seems
evident the murderer is in this room
they all stared at him incredulously
he watched every changing face for
some incriminating sign but could de-
tect none each prisoner scrutinized
his or her neighbor from head to foot
for traces of blood

  get back in line young fellow or-
dered gus i havent forgot that
youre clever

  shelley complied willingly again all
became silent until monty seeing a
large automobile draw up outside be-
gan to plead for clemency

  gad officer im innocent i swear
i am he begged his voice trembling
like a doomed mans what can you
arrest me for i never broke a law
in my life look at these clothes if
youre going to take me anywhere ive
got to look presentable

  he started for his door but was
quickly recalled to line by a flourish of
the officers big blue-steel revolver
even in the seriousness of the situation
shelley felt inclined to laugh at montys
idea of dressing up to be arrested

  wouldnt i be a fine cop if i let
you walk out jested the officer the
judge wont mind meeting you in those


the crystal ball

clothes a lord and a man murdered
a wad of jewels stolen and two women
claiming to be the same person guess
thats enough to pull the whole gang
for by the way whos got that box
of jewelry

  the murderer of my husband re-
plied the melancholy black-haired lady
edgeworth

  hes got it corrected laura par-
sons and pointed to shelley who at
that moment had his hand on it in his
pocket

  then hes the murderer of lord
edgeworth deduced the officer tak-
ing out a pair of handcuffs and ad-
vancing toward shelley hand over
the trinkets young fellow

  before shelley could surrender the
jewel case the nell somebody fainted
limply into the arms of the big police-
man her weight and his astonishment
combined caused him to lose aim long
enough for shelley to extract from the
table drawer an old muzzle-loading re-
volver which although it had not been
loaded for years served the purpose
admirably in working a bluff

  by the time the confused officer ex-
tricated himself from the embrace of
the swooning woman he beheld shel-
leys pistol staring him in the face
nell somebody lay unconscious across
the arm of a large leather chair be-
fore any one fully realized what had
happened the new conquerer stood in
the foreground covering the submissive
group with his unloaded weapon

  dont raise that gun he ordered
the officer ill have to bother you to
drop it and take my place in line the
quicker the better thats it

  for a second the new prisoner looked
dazed then seeing the young mans
earnestness he sullenly obeyed at
once shelley appropriated the officers
six-shooter and after exhibiting the
empty chambers laid the old one aside
he took a seat poised the revolver on
his knee and commissioned monty to

get the smelling salts and attend to cas-
ualties

  now that he had control of the mot-
ley crew of strangers shelley hardly
knew how to get them off his hands
or how to welcome the patrol full of
bluecoats which rosenstein had gone
for

  a tower clock struck eleven and
neither rosenstein nor the police patrol
had yet appeared monty was still en-
gaged in fanning nell and applying cold
towels to her head as the officer be-
gan to feel the ignominy of surrender-
ing his pistol to an unarmed man his
irish temper rose and he came fear-
lessly toward his subduer

  do you think you can get away with
this monkey business he blurted out
id be a fine cop if istood for it

  well what do you think you will
do about it taunted shelley taking
a careful aim at the rebellious officer
step back in line before i forget that
im not target practicing and pull the
trigger

  without arguing he did as he was
bidden and did it very quickly as
soon as he was quieted the women be-
gan to show signs of mutiny

  what are you going to do with us 
asked laura parson uneasily dont
give us to the police we havent done
anything to you

  yes you have contradicted shel-
ley speaking to them all youve mur-
dered our servant toyo and whoever
did it had just as well say so because
im going to keep you here until i find
out

  except for nells occasional groans
there was complete silence evidently
no one was in a confessing mood

 you wont be boss here long
grunted the officer still smarting with
shame a wagonload of cops will be
here soon and it wont look good for
you when the murdered lords jewels
are found on you

  i told you it would bring bad luck
the crystal ball



piped monty unthinkingly as he admin-
istered another wet towel

  having something else on his mind
shelley ignored the utterance since
none of you will admit the crime he
said very seriously tell me mrs par-
sons where is your husband the eng-
lish army officer who gave you the crys-
tal ball

  this bit of enlightenment brought
consternation all eyes turned on
laura parsons

  tm not married she contradicted
him firmly i never knew an army
officer in my life

  you told me not three hours ago
that you were married to a man in the
army he reminded her now which
time were you telling the truth she
remained silent and ill at ease well
tell me this he persisted were you
ever employed as a maid by lord edge-
worths wife

  she started forward then controlled
herself with indignant cunning why
should you know my full history
because it is important he replied
tm determined to clear this thing up
if it takes all night so you people had
just as well sit down and make your-
selves comfortable you are my guests
and you will continue to be until one
of you decides to open up and give
me some information there are two
things im going to find out-where
mrs parsons husband is and what
happened to our servant

  so long as you have the crystal
ball interceded laura parsons craft-
ily what does it matter whether or
not i have a husband

  nevertheless i intend to find him
affirmed shelley and the sooner you
tell me where he is the better and
you-he turned to the dark-haired
lady edgeworth-you couldnt possi-
bly have been in the same room with
toyo without knowing something about
his death

  i can tell you nothing about it said
the accused lady reticently

  if you did not have a hand in it
why this secrecy persisted shelley

  she adroitly centered her attentions
upon the contents of her mesh bag as
though she had not heard him he
took time to think by leisurely changing
his position this mysterious situation
could not detain him much longer he
figured with such a bunch of women
the facts were bound to leak out soon
his only means of learning the secret
of the crystal ball and the truth about
toyos curious death was watchful and
inquisitive waiting at least so he de-
termined

  from their faces he could ascertain
nothing every one wore a strained ex-
pression but none revealed more guilt
than the others the big officer whose
hot-tempered red face behind the
scraggy black mustache faintly resem-
bled a sunset through a brush pile
sprang to his feet and towered menac-
ingly over shelley but could do noth-
ing

  do you know what youve done
do you  he sputtered angrily
youve spoiled the biggest haul i ever
came near making and knocked me out
of a chance for captain stripes thats
what youve done

  you would make a pretty captain
put in laura parsons who also was
in an argumentative mood anybody
who would let an unarmed man take
his revolver away from him is a dis-
grace to the force you have let us
fall into the hands of a murderer your
cowardice has put us at his mercy a
fine captain youd make

  this time it was the officers turn to
quail he became as meek as a suck-
ling lamb shelley only smiled at be-
ing referred to as a murderer in the
hope of catching a clew he chose to let
them do the talking rather than pro
claim his innocence

  you can blame no one but yourself
s

the crystal ball

spoke up the black-haired lady edge-
worth accusing laura parsons the
officer may be at fault but you are re-
sponsible for this whole entanglement
you and your husband wherever he
may be brought it all about by murder-
ing lord edgeworth my own dear hus-
band and i seek revenge for every
drop of his blood

  instead of cringing laura parsons
turned pale with fear she opened her
dry lips to speak but was interrupted
by the blond lady edgeworth

 your own dear husband she
mocked with a sarcastic laugh lord
edgeworth never had but one wife and
i am that one you are an impostor
and a blackmailer dont think for a
minute that you can assume my name
and get his fortune it belongs to me
and i will have it

  this assertion caused the revived
nell to sit up quickly but the crys-
tall ball necklace belongs to me she
proclaimed exhibiting her letter from
the late lord edgeworth he gave it
to me i have his promise in writing
so you see i am not a fake

  the colorless face of the black-haired
lady edgeworth became livid who
are you she demanded abruptly

  i was a friend of your husbands-
a very good friend replied the other
he and i were pals for over a year
read the letter it says he cared more
for me than any woman on earth
thats why he promised me the jewels
i came for them the moment i heard
of his death

  aftec finishing reading the black-
haired lady edgeworth eyed the nell
woman fiercely i believe you are ly-
ing she breathed between clenched
teeth as she fought back her tears my
husband could never have written such
a disgusting sickening letter he made
no promiscuous friendships you have
concocted this scheme and imitated his
writing

  its a lie cried the other woman
with her voice pitched high and ill
prove it ill prove it

  now now calmed shelley rather
puzzled at the queer characters lets
not squabble its a very interesting
little argument but you arent getting
anywhere too much of a bluffing con-
test his lordship seems to have been
a great ladies man now i have a sug-
gestion to make since all of you wives
and women cant have his treasure sup-
pose you divide the small jewels and
toss a coin to decide who shall have the
crystal ball

  to this proposition there rose a cho-
rus of objections as he drew the mo-
rocco case from his pocket and held its
contents up to the gaze of the women
they started forward entranced and
fascinated even the soured officer sat
up and took notice

  so thats whats causing all the
rumpus ugh he grunted some
sparkler it beats me how women lose
their heads over jewelry show that
necklace to a woman and shell go crazy
as a loon and murder anybody to get
her hands on it

  here the philosophizing officer was
interrupted by the doorbell shelley
sprang up and pulled the hall doorway
curtains together then delegated monty
to see who was calling at this late hour
it proved to be only another telegram
bearing the unwelcome news that his
aged aunt had suffered a relapse and
was sinking rapidly this put him in
a quandary he had not forgotten that
he needed money most of all but was
he to get it by sticking here in quest
of the reward for lord edgeworths
slayer or by finding a wife and inherit-
ing his aunts estate it took him only
a moment to decide that the latter
course seemed the safer

  monty he said planning as he
spoke i dont know how i would have
gotten along without you to-night now
im going to ask another favor of you
the crystal ball



my aunt is worse and ive got to find
a wife

  id be glad to do it old man but i
dontknow where there are any com-
plained monty

  shelley smiled half at monty and
half at the puzzled faces of the rest of
his auditors leave that to me he
said proffering monty his revolver
what i want you to do is to take this
gun and keep this bunch of guests here
while i go to get married also look
after the apartment and call the coroner
to investigate toyos death

  monty tottered me  he asked his
voice trembling i swear vern i
dont know a blooming thing about a
weapon id be more likely to shoot
myself than my assailant im afraid
old man youll have to arrange it some
other way

  there is no other way declared
shelley giving him a bracing blow on
the back i guess you can last an
hour anyway all you have to do is
just sit here with it aimed tike this
and if any of them start anything let
go above all dont go to sleep

  with a shaking hand monty accepted
the pistol and took his position as guard
the officer who little fancied the idea
of being detained jumped to his feet
to protest

  its a raw deal he bellowed with
accompanying gestures

  might be worse sympathized shel-
ley hurriedly luck to you monty
youll hear from me after the smoke
has cleared away

  snatching up hat and coat he passed
out of the apartment and down the
corridor before he got outside the
building a muffled report of a pistol shot
reached his ears then followed sev-
eral faint screams and the slamming of
a door instantly he turned and ran
back

  after hearing the shot and commo-
tion shelley was almost afraid to enter
the library he could not help but ptc-

  atb

ture the room as a scene of carnage
with poor monty drenched in a pool of
blood so he was not surprised at what
he found except that he expected to
see one of the men in charge

  as he entered on the run he was
stopped short by the commanding voice
of the black-haired lady edgeworth
who covering him with her dainty
pearl-handled revolver ordered him
into line after obeying he looked
about him at the terror written on every
face especially on that of the lady with
the weapon again nell had collapsed
in a faint the room still smelled
of powder smoke and over against the
wall face down lay the dead body of
laura parsons

  what does this mean he asked
displeased at having his apartment
turned into a morgue

  it means replied the black-haired
lady edgeworth her eyes flashing des-
perately that i have killed my maid
who together with her husband mur-
dered my husband for the crystal ball
necklace it is my revenge and when
i find her accomplice he shall suffer
the same penalty

  where is my friend monty the fel-
low i left in charge here inquired
shelley looking for him in vain

  here i am vern called a voice
from the closet dont worry about
me old man i wasnt hit but gad i
had a close call

  the speakers cheerfulness gave
every evidence that he was thankful to
be alive and out of the danger zone
after falling from power his conqueror
had locked him in the closet like a
naughty child

  monty weve played the devil said
shelley looking sadly at the lifeless
form of the encyclopedia agent the
place looks like a battlefield

  i told you that deuced stone would
bring us bad luck monty reminded
him through the keyhole for
heavens sake vern get rid of them


the crystal ball

  just then the officer started to pick
up the automatic which had been
dropped in fright by the closeted one
madam he said til take this gang
off your hands now youll have to
come along too and tell em your rea-
sons for shooting the girl its my
duty as an officer

  dont move or i will fire she com-
manded with calm determination you
have already shown your ability as a
guard

  needless to say the officer did not
move an eyelid the lady in black
then turned to shelley and without
any questions demanded the necklace
after he had complied she went to the
window with her face always toward
the group and raised and lowered the
shade three times as a code signal to
her assistants outside

  while waiting for them nell again
revived enough to sit up and look about
dazedly she could not comprehend
the situation at all and riearly wilted
again her first words were where
am i  has there been an accident 
more of a riot id call it explained
shelley two dead and none injured
youll read it all in the morning pa-
pers

  dead she gasped terror-stricken
what killed them  who are all these
people 

  no friends of mine assured shel-
ley watching the clock begrudgingly
and thinking of his aunts condition
all i know about this whole mysteri-
ous affair is that we are fortunate to
be among the living you fainted just
at the right time nell

  she rose with insulted dignity

  be seated ordered the somber
lady edgeworth causing a shriek by
pointing the revolver at her wait
until my detectives come

  however her detectives were not the
next to arrive about four minutes
later to be exact a rather shabby griz-
zled fellow appeared in the hall door-

way a cap was pulled low over his
eyes and a roll-neck sweater completely
concealed the lower portion of his face
when he beheld the officer his nerves
slightly wavered with a hunted look
he watched the front door incessantly
a pistol leveled in his steady right
hand

  drop it he commanded the lady
with the pearl-handled weapon whose
back was turned then without losing
a moment he stepped swiftly and
boldly into the room his group of
subjects were stunned even dottie
dills she of the star dropped pad and
pencil to stare with open mouth in
all his years of beat walking officer
murphy had only dreamed of such ex-
periences as these

  quick who lives here the stranger
asked

   do answered shelley what
may i do for you 

  tell me where my wife is spoke
the fellow rapidly as if hard pressed
for time she came here this after-
noon and i havent seen her since
before shelley could tell him that
he knew nothing about his wife the fel-
low noticed the figure lying on the floor
in the corner dropping to his knees
beside it he looked into the face of
laura parsons

  my god its my laura he mut-
tered discarding his pistol and shaking
her speak to me little wife oh
my little laura

  his weak voice and thin hands trem-
bled any of the others could have
easily seized his weapon but they re-
mained like statues glued to their
chairs

  who did this he demanded with
fierce eyes tell me wheres the cur
somebodys got to pay ill make them
at that moment some one passed
down the outside hallway the stran-
ger paled and crouched behind a chair
hide me he whispered shaking
with fright theyre after me for a
the crystal ball



murder i never heard of-some fool
englishman i never saw quick man
hide me for justices sake

  the listeners looked aghast at him
their brains were in a hopeless muddle

  what are you so frightened about 
shelley asked if you are innocent-
stand up like a man and tell them so
hide me and ill reward you
pleaded the stranger extending some-
thing sparkling in the palm of his hand
heres a jewel known as the crystal
ball its worth a fortune hide me
quick and you can have it

  still more were the listeners aghast
shelley refused to touch it the lady
in black took out her treasure and
looked at it to see if she could be see-
ing double

  i know who you are she said fear-
lessly you were lord edgeworths
valet and disappeared with your wife
on the night he was killed where did
you get that diamond  there was only
one such stone

  mine is the original and yours is an
imitation he boasted forgetting him-
self then in humbleness he turned to
shelley take it and hide me will
you  or have i got to force you 

  the outer door having remained
open ever since shelley returned on the
run the supposedly dead lord edge-
worth entered unheard he was an
angular monocled englishman with a
leisurely stride a flexible bamboo cane
and a cigarette at the sight of him
the stranger dropped his weapon in
amazement the others drew back
with the feeling that they were looking
at a dead mans ghost

  what a jolly queer little gathering
he exclaimed with an english drawl
is my wife hereabouts

after hesitating a moment she threw
herself into his arms while the blond
adventuress and the overly powdered
nell exchanged hopeless glances
why dear i thought you were mur-

dered sobbed lady edgeworth
look i have even bought mourning
clothes where on earth have you
been

  at the club he responded calmly
i have been to your rooms for you
several times but you were never there
you know

  but why did all the servants leave
at the same time and what became o
the crystal ball necklace she asked
in one breath i thought surely you
had been murdered or robbed

  i lost heavily at cards he explained
briefly and had to pawn the jewels
i also discharged the servants to cut
expenses

  why did you leave in the middle of
the night  she next wanted to know

  aw im tired of lying he laughed
suddenly dropping his english accent
as a distant tower clock struck twelve
the time is up let dolly explain the
rest

  as the clock finished striking dolly
her face radiant with a mischievous
smile rushed in from the hall where
the englishman had left her waiting for
the appointed time

  its midnight she announced her
bright eyes dancing so you may all
remove your disguise

  immediately wigs mustaches grease
point and talcum powder were removed
amid laughter and chatter the peer-
less new vampire alias laura parsons
the encyclopedia agent and toyo came
to life without the least difficulty the
blank cartridges were removed from
the revolvers and the impromptu mel-
odrama was over without their make-
ups shelley immediately recognized the
women as studio friends of dollys
lord edgeworth was roy hedges the
peerless villain and his murderer was
a peerless camera man in real life

  rosenstein drifted in behind dolly
who had held him prisoner since going
for the police patrol

  gad vern whats the excitement 
ioo

the crystal ball

called montys voice from the closet
where he had been forgotten give me
air

  he came forth blinking at the light
and all joined in the laughter except
rosenstein the officer and dottie dills
whose story had suddenly switched
from tragedy to farce shelley still had
a puzzled look as he surveyed the varie-
gated lot

  well where did you get all this
crystal ball business he asked

  its a play that roy wrote last year
for the allied war fund bazaar ex-
plained dolly laughing at him when
i learned that my peerless contract
would expire at midnight i began to
think of some way to keep you here
unmarried until then because i really
did not want you to marry and i
knew the only way was to make you
forget your fortune so we decided
to act the crystal ball here just as we

acted it at the bazaar and even bribed
toyo to play dead for us

  rosenstein the moving-picture mag-
nate scribbled something and handed
it to his valued actor and director roy
hedges this is for the moving-pic-
ture rights to your crystal ball hedges
its great deliver the scenario at
once

  i will bargained hedges with the
understanding that you renew shelleys
five-year contract to continue starring
at his former salary

  rosenstein consented remarking that
beezness is beezness

  if you happen to have seen the crys-
tal ball on the screen with vernon
shelley and dolly cameron starring
you probably noticed that their ten-
foot close-up kiss which faded into
the end was a genuine eighteen-
karat honeymooners caress instead of
the usual cut-and-dried stage business

  hidden pathways

               by albert owens

mow that we part let love say everything

      still all the troubled whispers and despair
we have possessed a dream    what do we care
for any aftermath of questioning

ah let us join our frail frail hands and sing   
illusions are but bubbles filled with air
that burst like voiceless music when we dare
to sound the depths of lifes dull muttering

and let these roses by our yesterdays

each one a single crimson flash of light

for love is always free it only stays

in all the speed and splendor of its flight
with those who go upon their separate ways
along the hidden pathways of the night

ii-death by duplicate

    being a further account of the marvelous experiences of the double man
as detailed by doctor mordaunt p dale world-renowned psychic expert and
fellow of the international academy of scientific and supernatural research
doctor dales manuscript being much too technical for other than scientific minds
to understand he has consented to mr broadwelvs simpler presentation of his
thesis in the columns of the thrill book-editor

are william gray and arthur
wadleigh-eight thousand miles
apart-actually one man

  i doctor mordaunt p dale fellow
of the international academy of sci-
entific and supernatural research hes-
itate to submit my weird thesis to the
world lest i be considered bereft of
reason

 the world however knows now
since the original story of the double
man was unfolded in barest outline
and without detail in the thrill
books issue preceding this that sci-
ence thus far stands baffled before this
mystery it is in hope of rousing my
fellow scientists to interest themselves
more deeply in the matter that i ven-
ture not without trepidation to permit
publication of my observations i am
as yet unable to offer to the world

any conclusions in the premises or any
explanations of the phenomena i have
witnessed

  it will be recalled by the many thou-
sands of persons who read the story
of the double man in the thrill
book that whenever william gray a
stockbroker in wall street fell asleep
in new york he immediately would
awaken as arthur wadleigh repre-
sentative of the london ivory com-
pany in cape town british south
africa eight thousand miles away

  conversely whenever he would fall
asleep as wadleigh he would awaken
immediately as william gray in new
york

  physically and mentally fatigued
both wadleigh and gray resorted to
morphine to deaden their occult sor-
rows and finally both were committed


tales of the double man

to insane asylums gray in new york
and wadleigh in cape town

  scientists of two continents-i might
say of the whole world-were startled
by the haunting mystery of the se
as only one ever before had been re-
corded but this record was so ob-
scure and vague that it helped little
in solving the wadleigh-gray and
gray-wadleigh daily intertransmigra-
tions however that the reader may
have as full and comprehensive an in-
sight as myself into the matter i shall
briefly cite the circumstances of that
other nebulous record from ancient
days

  six thousand years ago in egypt
that land of mysticism and unfathomed
wonders two of the reigning pharaohs
favorite nobles were stricken with sim-
ilar inexplicable intertransmigrations
until they also like mr gray and mr
wadleigh became insane and died si-
multaneously

  the ancient records of the egyptian
priesthood discovered by that eminent
scientific explorer doctor bradford
wells-durand set forth that this rare
conjunction of souls in two bodies re-
curs but once every six thousand years
it would seem that their prophecy was
true although how they could have
known baffles doctor bradford wells-
durand and myself nevertheless they
knew we wonder at the pyramids
and how they could have been built
in that ancient day nevertheless they
were built and still remain a mystery
to science

  the records also reveal that every
effort was made to discover the mystic
occult link which made one entity of
two men with two souls and two bodies
living far apart from one another in
the ancient papyrus record the distance
between the two egyptians was put
at some four hundred miles in the
case of wadleigh-gray the distance is
twenty times as great nevertheless
the transition of souls is instantaneous

as we have ascertained by careful com-
parisons of the time-myself and my
scientific confreres in cape town-
upon each manifestation of the varying
phases in this riddle of soul-and-body
doubles

  by their great art the priests of that
remote day sought but in vain to sever
this link of destiny which bound two
mens souls more firmly together spirit-
ually than the siamese twins were
bound physically

  and now six thousand years after-
ward modem science likewise is seek-
ing-so far in vain-for that super-
human link-or is it a human link-
the severance of which alone will bring
peace and happiness and health to the
double man

  among the scientists in cape town
who are delving deeply into this mod-
ern fulfillment of the ancient prophecy
is doctor lucien trebaux the re-
nowned french authority on psychic
and occult manifestations he is as-
sisted there by doctor philip spauld-
ing who has attended mr arthur
wadleigh since his mystic intertransmi-
grations began with my patient mr
william gray

  i find mr grays personal physician
doctor marvin porter of incalculable
assistance in my study of this absorb-
ing mystery as he attended mr gray
from the first manifestations of a hu-
man duplication with mr wadleigh in
cape town

  and now to the subject-or subjects
as i should say-to which the eyes of
the scientific world are turned

 when mr gray was taken to the
psycopathic ward in bellevue hospital
i was called in to make a diagnosis of
his case i found him suffering from
the effects of morphine which he had
used in doses far in excess of any taken
by patients i previously had treated
normally this should have killed him
i was amazed to find him alive

  his pulse and temperature together
tales of the double man

m

with his respiration were so reduced
as to be barely discernible when i
first saw him i believed him dead but
of course this was disproved upon
thorough examination indeed many
persons have been given up for dead
and have been buried when a more
thorough examination would have
spared them the nameless horrors of a
living entombment

  grays body at first glance and test
as i have said exhibited all the symp-
toms of rigor mortis

  not until i brought my best stetho-
scope into play-and here i wish to
interpolate a vigorous protest against
the many defective stethoscopes now
being used by members of my profes-
sion and whose faulty instruments have
been the cause of many a persons
burial alive while in a state of sus-
pended animation-not until i brought
my best my most trustworthy stetho-
scope into play i say was it possible
for me to contradict the evidence of
my eyes and sense of feeling

  i took every possible means to re-
suscitate mr gray from his lethargic
sleep which i ascribe to a modified de-
gree of suspended animation superin-
duced by semiparalysis of the nerves
through excessive morphine addiction
not until the third day did i succeed
in restoring himto consciousness

  his first words on waking were

  send to natal for the ivory now
ready for shipment

  five minutes later he querulously in-
quired 

  whats the quotation on c b 
q

  apparently at the moment of wak-
ing his spirit had returned from its
mystic transmigration into the body of
mr wadleigh in cape town and in
his physically and mentally weakened
condition mr gray had not been able
immediately to throw off the wadleigh
influence else i reasoned his first

remark would have been one referring
to the stock market

 inasmuch as my eight-thousand-
miles-distant confrere in cape town
and myself had arranged for immediate
radio communication concerning any
important developments at either end
of this complex problem i sent the
details to doctor lucientrebaux quot-
ing mr grays waking words and the
intervals between each remark of my
patient the return dispatch from
cape town more than startled me

  i insert here doctor trebauxs re-
ply radiogram to me in new york
translated from the code

doctor mordaunt p dale new york

  at cxactly the moment mr gray awoke
in new york mr wadleigh here in cape
town who had been awake for a few min-
utes felt into a steep so profound and so
closely resembling death that only the most
minute examination proved him alive i
was about to radio you his words upon his
awaking prior to the sudden relapse into
siumber when your radio arrived mr wad-
leighs words were exactly the same as mr
grays but reversed that is to say his first
waking sentence was whats the quota-
tion on c b  q his second sentence
was send to natal for the ivory now
ready for shipment the first sentence was
mr grays second and the sccond was mr
grays first it is indeed mysterious i
would have expected mr wadleigh to have
spoken first of ivory but it was apparent
that he had not immediately shaken off the
effects of his soul transmigration into mr
grays body we must keep in constant
touch by radio if we hope to unravel the
tangled skein which fate has woven between
the souls of our unfortunate patients

doctor lucien trebaux

  as i said before this message so
astounded me and my fellow watchers
at the bedside of mr gray that in
the ensuing discussion we entirely neg-
lected to maintain a vigil on mr grays
condition for any sudden or abnormal
changes

  for fully half an hour he lay thus
unobserved and i must confess to a
sense of deep personal humiliation that
i should have been so startled out of


tales of the double man

my usual scientific poise as thus to have
forgotten my heavy burden of obliga-
tion to science and posterity but
withal i doubt if ever before such a
phenomenon-such a miracle i might
term it-confronted a scientist

  imagine my chagrin and that of my
cowatchers at mr grays bedside when
we turned and beheld him again
plunged into deepest sleep

  shortly afterward came this radio-
gram from doctor lucien trebeaux in
cape town

doctor mordaunt p dale new york

  at seven-thirty-five p m an interval of
thirty-two and one-half minutes mr wad-
icigh awakened suddenly and sat up in bed
staring perplexedly about the room i asked
him it he wished anything but he shook his
head in the negative his eyes seemed to
hold a dread of something horrible or fear-
ful then he muttered its william gray
or ine wholl be the one when i asked
him what these mysterious words meant he
did not answer but a look of ferocity
dawned in his eyes so vindictive and deter-
mined that  was startled i can only con-
jecture that these two men with mental
visions made keener by insanity have learned
that the one who survives the other if by a
fraction of a second only will continue to
live and become normal again however
this is merely conjecture i can feel a crisis
approaching in this weird duel of souls and
 wonder if mr wadleigh or his duplicate
self mr gray will survive the other or if
they must die simultaneously as in the case
of the two ancient egyptians i would
strongly advise the most rigid vigils at your
end of the riddle from this time on mr
wadlcitfh begins to show signs of relapsing
into sleep i shall further advise you and
in the meantime at this end shall continue
constantly on the alert for any new de-
velopments in this puzzle of the ages

doctor lucien trebaux

  naturally enough my assistants and
myself redoubled our vigilance at mr
grays bedside

  we were rewarded soon afterward
by noticing subtle changes in the face
of the sleeper an expression of fear
was followed by one of anger then of
deep purpose anon of sullen hatred
and then-great heavens-mr gray

suddenly awakened and sat up in bed
exclaiming with ghoulish triumph

  wadleighs dead wadleighs dead y

  i consulted my watch and noted the
exact moment he made this weird dec-
laration concerning the death of his
other self in far-off africa the hands
pointed exactly to eleven a m

  doctor marvin porter hastened out
to radio this startling intelligence to
doctor trebaux in cape town when
he was intercepted by a messenger
hastening in with a radio from doctor
trebaux himself

  with fingers actually trembling in
nervousness i opened the dispatch to
read after laborious code translation
the following

doctor mordaunt p dale new york

  mr wadleigh died suddenly at what in

new york would be eleven a m would have
flashed sooner except that radio service was
crippled by some mechanical defect and has
just been restored to operation

doctor lucien trebaux

  gray had been right then wad-
leigh was dead-had died at the exact
moment mr gray said he had died
what could be the explanation as
though to thwart me mr gray thor-
oughly exhausted fell back upon his
pillow unconscious fearing some un-
toward developments might result if he
were not immediately resuscitated i
diligently set to work at that task aided
by doctor porter

  half an hour later mr gray opened
his eyes and gazed up at me the
weird look of the insane was gone from
them i noticed and his heart action
and respiration were more nearly nor-
mal than they had been since his col-
lapse

  the strenuous efforts i had made to
revive him including certain vigorous
osteopathic methods had caused me to
perspire freely and some drops of
moisture fell from my brow upon his
face i wiped them away with my
handkerchief
tales of the double man



  how do you feel mr gray i in-
quired

  weak-very weak he whispered
have i been ill

  rather you must rest now are
you sleepy

  no-just tired ive had an awful
nightmare

  are you strong enough to tell me
of it

  yes you are aware of my strange
double entity

  i nodded

  welh i guess thats all done for
now

 done for i asked amazed
what do you mean

  i mean that mr wadleigh my other
self in cape town is dead

  how do you know

   dont-except that what i call my
nightmare proved it to me
proceed i told him

  in the weird intertransmigration of
our souls-mine to wadleighs body
his to my body-we both somehow
learned that one of us must die if the
other were to live the question was
which one of us would be the survivor
upon my soul-as upon his-dawned
the realization that to-days flight across
eight thousand miles of space would be
the last for one of us-perhaps for both
of us i remember it all it was
awful

  mr gray shuddered and his expres-
sion betokened unearthly horror i
greatly feared he was overtaxing his
strength and implored him to rest a
while but he insisted he was strong
enough to continue his revelation

  fearing he might die before the
world would learn his story i permitted
him to continue which he did as fol-
lows

  in all the intertransmigrations that
i underwent i always was subtly con-
scious of passing en route the spirit of
mr wadleigh winging its way to my
unconscious body in new york each

such flight seemed endlessly long a
matter of aeons yet i know none en-
dured for more than a fractional part
of a second as allowing always for
difference in time the clocks in wad-
leighs cape town and my new york
rooms showed on their respective dials
exactly the same hour the same min-
ute and i almost could swear the
same second

  always in these flights my soul
ears could detect the myriad messages
passing in the outer areas of ethereal
space from spirit to spirit and inter-
mingled with them i could detect the
harsher stridency of the to human ears
noiseless but to my soul ears clanging
notes of the radiograms sent from wire-
less station to wireless station carry-
ing the messages of mortals from place
t place

  once on these flights i actually
was delayed by coming into contact
with the nebulous shade of one who
told me in spirit voice that he was na-
poleon i and who demanded an apol-
ogy from me for colliding with him in
space this may sound absurd and
uncanny but it is- as true as that i
am speaking to you a stranger doctor
-doctor -

  doctor mordaunt p dale i said
thus introducing myself to mr gray

  glad to know you doctor dale
he said ive often heard of you and
your wonderful researches in the oc-
cult field you dont think im crazy
do you doctor his voice was anx-
ious

  not at all i said heartily although
to be frank i actually believed him still
in a stage of mental abnormality

  it seemed too ridiculous to believe
that this wall street broker could be
sane prating thus of spiritual encoun-
ters with the shade of napoleon hear-
ing voices in the heavenly voids and
being able to distinguish the sounds of
the wireless-message tickings in space
nevertheless i am too much of a sci-

fetched or beyond the realms of pos-
sibility  have seen too many instances
of the impossible becoming the reality
the improbable becoming the possible
to be entirely skeptical consequently
as i was anxious to hear more of this
romantic tale from mr gray i urged
him to continue he seemed very
greatly relieved and resumed

  i had no time to talk to napoleon
as some mystic force was pulling me
straight through the emperors shade
toward my other body-that of mr
wadleigh-in cape town i know
that i tried to mumble an apology but
i guess napoleon never heard it

  one of the peculiar features of my
arrival at or departure from either
my body or that of mr wadleigh was
that i never experienced other than a
slight sensation of vibration

  when the flight took place which
i heard whispered by those mysterious
voices in space was to be the last be-
tween my self and wadleigh i deter-
mined that wadleigh must not beat me
to it as we say in the new york ver-
nacular or i would be the one to per-
ish a man must live doctor and i
hanker to be alive as william gray
rather than as arthur wadleigh

  i therefore concentrated all my soul
power upon meeting his shade more
than halfway-outspeed him if by the
barest fraction of a second only-and
so i forced myself being then in wad-
leigh s body awake to go to sleep then
i propelled myself with instantaneous
power through the ethereal realm into
my own body here in new york i
passed wadleighs soul when it was but
two-fifths of the way toward his own
body in cape town and so i awakened
here and remember that i then told
you wadleigh was dead

  this is all that i know except that
i would like to have you prevent the

  embalming of mr wadleighs body so
that should he be not actually dead he
will have a chance to come back from
the tomb to normal human estate if
science can disentangle our souls i
suppose some of my turbulent emotions
in the soulful estate and struggle for
supremacy in that last flight must have
been reflected in my face were they
i told mr gray of the demoniacal
expressions i had seen in his counte-
nance and also reported doctor lucien
trebauxs radio report concerning the
same contortions witnessed in the face
of mr wadleigh eight thousand miles
away

  why is this curse visited on us-on
me i mean asked gray mournfully
some day if i live through this hellish
experience i shall write some memoirs
that will astound the world especially
concerning the remarkable tangles into
which my love affairs have been mud-
dled by this intertransmigration i pre-
sume you will give to the world the
story of my doubled-up existence

  i told mr gray that his story writ-
ten by himself had been given already
to the world through the popular col-
umns of the thrill book by mr
gyde m broadwell who discovered
the papers left by mr gray among
other effects in his wall street office

  then i shall have mr broadwell
write my story said mr gray be-
ing in touch with you-

  he is handling my thesis on your
case i told gray it will be couched
in terms too technical for the average
mind untrained in the meaning of sci-
entific terms so he kindly offered him-
self as the medium between me and the
public

  then i shall tell him my story-
if i live to tell it

youll live i assured him keep
up your strength and try to sleep a lit-
tle now i left gray myself thor-
oughly fatigued by my long vigils
when some eight hours later i re-
tales of the double man



turned to mr grays bedside to relieve
doctor marvin porter i found gray
still wide awake eight hours later he
still was awake and displayed no indi-
cations of sleepiness beyond yawns and
a tired drawn look in his features

  in the interim had come a radiogram
from doctor lucien trebaux concern-
ing mr wadleigh the message will
explain more lucidly and at less length
than it would require for me to detail
the new denouements in this uncanny
drama of two continents i append it
here

doctor mordaunt p dale new york

  mr wadleigh although dead so far as
human-made instruments can determine
death still has the appearance of a living
man i

  acting upon your cable citing mr grays
statements to you i prevented the embalm-
ing of mr wadleighs body although this
is contrary to the law in cape town or-
dinarily in this hot climate a dead body
would enter the processes of dissolution and
decomposition within two hours after death
but mr wadleighs body nearly a day after
his demise still shows no slightest sign or
trace of decomposition or disintegration
we cannot do aught here than issue a burial
certificate i shall have his body placed in
a mausoleum instead of in the usual earth
grave so that should science have proved at
fault in this case which confounds science
we at least can disentomb the body at any
needful stage-unless wadleigh actually be
dead and decomposition later sets in matters
now seem to be in what i may term a con-
dition of status quo i marvel with you
at the inexplicable features of this most
astounding upsetting of all human facts and
scientific theories

doctor lucien trebaux

  this message i read to mr gray
he expressed deep relief and also
voiced his gratitude for my conveyance
to doctor trebaux of all the circum-
stances at the new york end of this
unbelievable yet actually authentic
anomaly

  i counseled mr gray to sleep and
rest just as i had counseled him sixteen
hours earlier he met my advice with
this unexpected declaration

  t cant sleep i want to but i
cant somehow ever since wadleigh
died sleep shuns me i believe my soul
attempts constant flights through space
to enter his body but is repelled be-
cause his spirit is either flown and he
is dead physically or because his soul is
dormant and unresponsive and thus is
unable to rise to wakefulness no matter
how mine may seek entrance to his
body if the latter is the case i sup-
pose hell awake some day if the
former is true ill never sleep naturally
again i know it i i feel it i actually
believe ill die awake

  here was a new problem i could
not permit mr gray to die from wake-
fulness caused by the death of his other
self such a proxy death never before
was recorded in this regard the gray-
wadleigh case differed from that an-
cient record of the two egyptians who
it will be remembered died simultane-
ously

  after sending a radio to doctor tre-
baux concerning this new dilemma i
administered an opiate to mr gray
and waited until the patient fell into
a deep but unnatural and uneasy sleep
for half an hour after he closed his
eyes i watched his face for any signs
that might help me toward the solution
of this baffling mystery

  then having made copious notes i
was glad to be relieved by doctor
porter to whom i explained all the
latest developments in the case this
was our custom when i returned
after a refreshing slumber doctor
porter informed me that he had jotted
down some wild disjointed words
spoken by mr gray in his sleep i
read doctor porters notes here they
are verbatim and in the order spoken
by mr gray

  elaine oh elaine

  tm not sleeping-oh-dead-dead
-no not dead

  erla-forgive-dont know half im
saying-dawn
io

tales of the double man

 spirit s-spirits-gray-cold-

oh hr

  enter-cant enter-ugh-h

  i puzzled over these cryptic utter-
ances after doctor porter went
elaine and erla were names of
girls i had learned that mr gray
had been engaged to miss erla kings-
ley of manhattan but that the engage-
ment had been broken off when he was
committed to the psycopathic ward in
bellevue hospital but of an elaine
i never had heard

 mr grays other expressions
not sleeping-dead-not dead-spir-
its-gray-cold-enter-cant enter-
dawn caused me much study and
perplexity not until i recalled his
seemingly irrational statement that his
soul probably had sought to enter wad-
leigh s body only to be repelled did it
dawn upon me that these expressions
might have been provoked by just such
an agonizing hartowing and supernat-
ural experience

  i was dumfounded by this thought

  with all dispatch i coded a radio
to doctor trebaux quoting mr grays
delirious words and my interpretation
of them  also asked doctor trebaux
to let me know if his dead patient
was acquainted with some girl named
elaine

  back came doctor trebauxs reply

doctor mokdavkt p daie new york

  your latest radio adds to the complexity
of this ease mr wadleigh was engaged to
a miss elaine brandon of cape town the
engagement was broken off when he was
sent to an asylum for the insane your
theory seems not unreasonable even though
improbable i frankly confess that i am all
at sea mr wadleigh was buried this morn-
ing in an ordinary casket inasmuch as de-
composition had not set in even up to the
moment of placing him in a vault i took the
precaution in case he should be in a condi-
tion of suspended animation only instead of
death to bore holes in the casket lid and to

leave it unfastened i also placed a weeks
supply of liquid provisions in the vault using
special thermos bottles as containers war-
ranted to withstand the effects of the warm
climate here this is all that we can do
now except to await further developments-
if there are to be more phenomena i shall
revisit mr wadleighs vault at weekly in-
tervals please keep me advised of mr
grays condition

doctor lucien trebaux

  when i turned toward mr gray
after reading this my patient was sit-
ting up in bed

  im hungry as a bear doctor he
said

  i attended to his creature wants and
then questioned him at some length
he told me that he had felt himself
dying as mr wadleigh but that the
sensation was merely one of deepest
languor nothingmore

  although i did think i was going
as william gray too he exclaimed
i began to feel so numb

  beyond this however i could glean
no new information no further en-
lightenment than i have set forth in
this thesis

  four days later after consultation
with other specialists i pronounced mr
gray sane and had him taken to his
home

  here on the fifth day i introduced
mr gray to mr broadwell who doubt-
less will publish more of mr grays
story from a viewpoint other than this
cut-and-dried narrative of a scientist

  should any remarkable phenomena
follow the visit of doctor lucien tre-
baux to the south african tomb of
mr wadleigh i shall be happy to make
them public in the meantime as i
said at the outset i have formed no
conclusions can offer no explanations
and must perforce be content as doc-
tor trebaux so happily phrased it to
consider the double mans case as
being still in status quo
a slight scream came from the
adjoining room and robert
neil dropped the book that he
was reading and hurried through the
doorway he found his wife with her
eyes fixed in alarm upon her left hand
which she held out at some distance
from her body

  oh she gasped ive been bit-
ten r

  bitten julia by what

  a dreadful black spider

  neil took his wifes hand in his and
looked at it there was a slight angry
spot upon the palm he kissed the
hand gently then placed his arm about
his wife come lets put it in hot
water to scatter the inflammation and
you will be all right in five minutes
but dear it was such a horrid big
black spider said the wife after her
injured hand had been held a while
in hot water then wrapped with a
soft strip of linen

  nonsense julia only a common
house spider

                        t

  anyway dear maintained the

wife it wasnt a common spider for
just before it bit me i heard it sing-
ing on the wall

  singing

  yes singing

  nonsense sweetheart

  but dearie it was singing-or
making a kind of singing noise at
first i thought that it had caught a
fly in its web and the singing was
causcd by the fly beating its wings but
i soon found there was no fly in the
web and it was the spider that was
making the strange singing noise
then the horrid thing leaped on my
hand and bit me

  robert neil took the injured hand
in his own and covered the bandage
with kisses and either the kisses or his
laughing assurance satisfied his wife
for she returned to her household du-
ties and soon had forgotten the inci-
dent of the spiders bite

  but neil searched along the wall ot
the room until he found a large black
no

the spider and the fly

spider sitting in the heart of its web
singing he dispatched the creature
making a purple spot on the wall which
he partially erased with his handker-
chief he then burned the handker-
chief

  a week passed and husband and wife
had forgotten about the spider bite
when the incident was suddenly re-
called to robert neil upon hearing his
wife singing it was a foreign song
yet that was no reason why the pecul-
iar whistling-singing note of the black
spider should again and again repeat
itself in the voice of the sweet singer
in the adjoiningroom

  neil called himself a fool for his
fancies yet a moment later he entered
his wifes chamber and begged her to
sing him an english song he didnt
like the air that she had been perform-
ing it failed to do justice to her voice

  the young wife complied and stoop-
ing to kiss her hair neil discovered a
large black spider crouching in the
brilliant jet folds shudderingly but
without informing his wife of the fact
he managed to knock the hairy crea-
ture to the floor and tread upon it
then he went about the house from
room to room and press to press hunt-
ing for spiders large black spiders
that sat in the heart of their webs and
sang but he found none

  at least not for a week then a
black spider appeared suddenly on the
carpet and leaped along and ran up the
dress of his yife lodging itself in
her dark hair his wife was seated
at the piano singing

  robert neil understood it was the
note that had come into his wifes voice
-that peculiar whistling-singing note
-that had attracted the spider to her
person to the black hairy creature
his wife was one of its own kind

  the next morning coming softly
into the parlor neil found his wife
seated by the window with her ear bent
over a handkerchief that lay upon a

small music rack she was intently
listening to something what could it
be he approached unobserved and
looked over her shoulder there was
a fly trapped beneath the handkerchief
and his wife was listening to the buzz-
ing of its wings

  robert neil was a brave man but as
he crept from the room and stole away
across the fields his knees shook under
him like those of a sick child

  when he returned to his home an
hour later he found his wife seated on
the porch with a book in her lap and
her face greatly animated he looked
into the sweet eyes that greeted him and
called himself a fool and a coward
heaven had not condemned this fair
young spirit to any such horrible doom
as he feared

  he kissed the lifted face and with-
out looking into the folds of the heavy
jet hair for something black and hide-
ous sat down beside his wife then
she began to jest at him

  dearie she said i wish you were
fat i like fat men

  why julia you are growing quite
material

  no dearie but i do wish you
were fatter do you remember harry
hall 

  neil did and now he recalled how

his wife had once compared the man to
a big bottlefly the recollection
brought him to his feet flies and
spiders

  why dearie whats the matter
are you ill 

  the man resumed his seat and brac-
ing himself in his chair attempted to
smile  twas nothing julia i
thought i heard some one at the gate

  julia neil looked toward the gate
and wondered that her husband should
have fancied that some one was com-
ing then after a moments brood-
ing she arose and placed her arm
about her husband

  dearie i want something
the spider and the fly

iii

  well julia what is it

  you wont laugh

  laugh nonsense

  well dearie i want a hammock
  a hammock 

  yes a hammock

  very well anything else

   no thats all 

  the next morning neil returned
from the village with a large ham-
mock which he swung on the porch
in the cool shade of the trellised morn-
ing-glories that climbed the house wall
an hour later he discovered that the
hammock was gone

  he immediately questioned the two
servants but they protested that they
had not taken his purchase he then
thought to question his wife but why
should she have removed the hammock
no some tramp had stolen it

  he soon returned from the village
with a second hammock which he also
swung on the porch then he con-
cealed himself behind the summer-
house and watched

  in a few minutes his wife came out
upon the porch and discovering the
second hammock untied the ropes and
took it into the house neil waited a
little while then hastened indoors
whistling boisterously he went from
room to room searching but he could
not find the hammock neither could
he find his wife he stopped whis-
tling and reflected the attic ah
his wife had gone up there he would
go up and help her hang the thing he
went to the head of the stairs but
found the attic door locked he lis-
tened some one was moving about
within the attic room busily engaged-
and singing

  his wife was hanging up the ham-
mock  the two hammocks ah she
was going to have a hammock party
up there in the attic and when every-
thing was ready she would send out

invitations-

  oh god sobbed the man and

turning he went down the stairs out of
the house into the wide fields

  it was night when he returned the
servants had left a lighted lamp in the
sitting room and gone off to the vil-
lage he blew out the light and sat
down in the dark waiting for his wife
to come to him

  suddenly a sound reached his ears
from somewhere above-a strange half-
singing half-whistling sound that mo-
mentarily grew louder he tried to
rise from his chair but failed again
he tried to rise and this time suc-
ceeded he took a step forward in the
dark and not falling took another
then he rushed headlong through the
doorway up the attic flight of stairs
and burst into the attic room

  it was pitch dark up there and he
could see nothing and hear nothing
now for his sudden entry had dis-
turbed the occupant of the room

  he stood very still and listened
suddenly the weird singing was re-
sumed very softly at first but grow-
ing louder and more distinct seemed
to charm him and leave him powerless
to move

  another sound now reached his ear
-the sound of something running
softly about him that wound his rigid
form in a thousand strands of some
material substance which as it bound
him closer and closer adhered to his
hands and clothing as if covered with
glue

  his eyes had grown more accustomed
to the dark and as this last sound
ceased the white bleu about him re-
solved itself into a network of many
glue-covered cords that bound him
rigid and helpless while crouching in
a hammock swung in a far corner of
the attic was a thing with two lumi-
nous eyes set in a womans face that
watched him and waited and now
drew nearer and nearer noiseless as a
spider that approaches a fly caught fast
in its web

chapter i

is it tuesday or wednesday

vntegar bill locker
glared at division superintend-
ent mallon with an expression
of indifferent disgust half-concealing
the torrents of wrath which were surg-
ing unspoken to his lips

  am i twenty-four hours late he
demanded i am not the real ques-
tion mr mallon is not that you
should instead ask me something sen-
sible ask me if a tomcat was pulling
the chicago-new york eighteen-hour
train to-day into albany and  admit
it also that a cockroach pulled her
from buffalo to syracuse and that both
of these high-powered animals under
their own steam kept six steel pull-
mans on schedule on both of those di-
visions so exactly that the section-men
along the line corrected their watches
when she flew by them
the superintendent knew vinegar
bill of old bill would bawl out
the roads president or his fireman with
equal promptness if the occasion
seemed to demand it he was the

 crack engineer of the road in storm
 or sunshine up hill or down with his
 regular train or an extra-heavy one
 he could not only make time but he
 had a genius for speeding up or slow-
 ing down for easing the seventy-mile
 an hour pride of the great central sys-
 tem around curves with perfect safety
 and without even the suggestion of an
 unnecessary jar also he could play
 the three hundred and more signals
 with such accuracy that the mathemati-
 cal theory of probabilities lent a color
 of reasonableness to the long-shot
 odds on horses at any track from
 sheepshead bay to juarez

   behind that engineer in various at-
 titudes of dejection sullen defiance or
 wide-mouthed bewilderment were
 others of his craft there stood paddy
 ryan who pulled the lake shore lim-
 ited for a livelihood and wrote popu-
 lar songs for a diversion behind
 paddy stood phlegmatic peter hopkins
 who shot in a little behind them both
 with a train schedule only forty min-
 utes slower and with nine cars instead
 of six close by were edward odon-
 nel who ran the empire state express
the lost days



fritz baum who sustained the prestige
of the system with the albany and
troy flyer with its running time of
one hundred and fifty-three ftiiles in
three hours and thirty minutes five
stops and nine slowdowns in the
group farther to the rear were tom
davenport whose run carried the mon-
treal express north and south harvey
roach with the adirondack express
and a half-dozen other passenger engi-
neers with local runs on the same divi-
sion

  the situation was unprecedented in
the memory of any of them never
before had so many engineers been
called to dance on the carpet in the
supers office at one time

  by common consent of seniority and
that iron nerve for which he was noted
vinegar bill had first faced the
superintendents astounding query of
how they all came to bring in their
trains on wednesday instead of tues-
day when the running time was from
two hours and forty minutes upward
between albany and new york

  a sullen growl of admiration at the
onslaught of his attack warned the
superintendent that vinegar bill was
not to be trifled with nor the other
members of the brotherhood of loco-
motive engineers behind him

  yet the situation was incomprehensi-
ble

  the superintendent turned to the
trainmaster at the desk beside him and
put the question baldly and so loud
that his words rang clear to the farther
end of the room

  jim is this tuesday or wednes-
day 

  wednesday sir according to the
same calendar we have always used
since ive been in the world and old
enough to tell when a day passed an-
swered james barr

  am i crazy or am i sane de-
manded the superintendent has any
atb

one shot me full of hop when i wasnt
looking or am i dreaming this

  if you are dreaming we all are
retorted the quick-witted trainmaster
ask the chief dispatcher though and
make sure hes been trying for
twenty-four hours to find out what
ailed the trains coming in every one of
them a day late and hes been trying to
get other trains into albany on sched-
ule as he always has only to have the
men on the albany wire cursing him
for a blundering idiot who was so crazy
that hed have all the rolling stock in
the hudson or piled up along the hills
if he didnt stop trying to run two
days trains on one days time

  ryan when did you leave albany
demanded superintendent mallon

  at the same time as always de-
clared the engineer the train may
have been a couple of minutes late and
i lost another two minutes as my de-
tention card will show at the block of
the tunnel just this side of poughkeep-
sie but i made it all up before the
train stopped at a hundred and
twenty-fifth street sir

  oh damnation roared the super-
intendent im not talking about min-
utes or detentions ryan what day
did you leave albany

  it was tuesday when i pulled out
of albany sir answered the engine-
driver respectfully but i never
passed so many northbound passenger
trains on that division in all me life
i had two crossovers as you know
where theres only room for three
tracks instead of four and i want to
say that this business is mighty skeery
when you meet twice as many pas-
senger trains as you ever saw before
and when you see twice as many freight
hogs gruntin along as are printed on
the time card-all headed north youre
thankful that theyre on different rails
from the one youre hittin the grit on
i had three blocks as my detention
card will show answered the man ad-
ii

the lost days

dressed and none of the extra trains
northbound were mentioned in my or-
ders when i left albany and it is
surely tuesday as all the other boys
wih swear how in the devil could we
be twenty-four hours late when we took
no more coal than we ever take and
had no layouts except those i have
mentioned 

  odonnel baum davenport roach
and the pilots of the local trains told
similar stories

  the muddle deepened into an unfath-
omable mix-up the more men the super-
intendent interrogated

  he pulled a newspaper from his
desk and flashed it before their eyes

  heres the evening sphere he sav-
agely yelled it is dated wednesday
-see it if im bugs so is the editor
of that paper-and the three hundred
thousand people who buy it and be-
sides i read tuesdays paper last
night

  dispatcher george johnson who
usually only held the chiefs trick for
eight hours under the law but who had
been frantically working straight
through the twenty-four trying to un-
tangle the death-freighted situation
listened attentively both he and the
other two men who held the same posi-
tions during the other sixteen hours
had thanked god in fear and trembling
more than fifty times during their or-
deal that the automatic block signals
and the matchless discipline of the road
had prevented accidents from rear-end
collisions now he raised his ghastly
face

  there is some situation here mr
mallon said he which no ordinary
investigation will adjust before com-
ing in i had a telephone call from the
chief dispatcher of the pennsylvania
system at their terminal he too was
fighting with all the crews on all in-
coming trains over whether this was
tuesday or wednesday i phoned to
the lehigh valley the delaware and

lackawanna the erie the reading the
baltimore and ohio the ontario and
western all of them tell the same
story of hoplessly mixed schedules and
every incoming engineer conductor and
trainman are in the same position as
our own men but we all know it is
wednesday

  that isnt all spoke up train-
master barr the brooklyn clarion
came over on the ferry to-day with a
tuesday date line so did the phila-
delphia papers no out-of-town papers
came at all yesterday and the incom-
ing people on the ocean steamers all
swear that it is tuesday instead of
wednesday so do the commuters
from long island and jersey the
jersey city papers those of newark
and other jersey state points all say
the same thing as these train and en-
gine crews

  the superintendent glared again at
the roomful of men

  do you mean to tell me  he thun-
dered that people in new york city
-millions of them-have gained a day
on the rest of the united states

  it certainly looks like it declared
vinegar bill solemnly how else
could we be leaving albany on time
keeping our trains to their usual speed
and arriving here at the terminal of
manhattan as you claim we have
twenty-four hours behind the sched-
ules

  as the confused throng wandered
aimlessly out of the office jack sam-
uels an assistant train dispatcher who
had been listening to the conversation
walked homeward

  he ascended the stairway to the little
flat where he lived stuck the key in
the door and kissed his youngster ten-
derly albeit a little mechanically

  pale and wan his sick wife raised
her lips for his greetings

  how are things to-day jackie
dear

  everybody but mes gone bugs he
the lost days



answered bluntly i cant make head
or tail of anything they arc trying to
do when johnson came to me in the
middle of my trick yesterday and de-
manded why i was trying to work over-
time and get the road in bad withthe
eight-hour law inspectors i thought
he had lost his mind but when right
behind him skinny finnegan mark
barstow and fred warren came on
duty for their trick which wasnt due
for four hours more i began to believe
that my watch had gone wrong but
it was right with the clock

  usually you know i get sixteen
hours off yesterday i had to take
only eight-and so help me god he
concluded solemnly they had stuck
wednesday on the top of the sheet
to-day on which we keep the train
schedule

  why did they do that asked the
perturbed helpmate

  dogged if i know wearily an-
swered samuels his face breaking into
a smile again dear you are always
right about everything is to-day
tuesday or wednesday

  why tuesday of course

  that settles it grinned back the
operator now i do know that they
are the dippy dubs and not  

chapter ii

fuddled financiers

qeorge watson junior part-
ner in the great banking firm of
f s davenport  co turned to his
private secretary impatiently

  get me randall  co on the phila-
delphia long-distance wire said he

  hello hello who is this oh
is that you mr peabody say whats

teenth of march thats right yes

delphia quit kidding peabody im

is wednesday in new york all right
all right 

  and thereafter mr watson gave a
fine imitation of temper and an ex-
ample of aboriginal and contemporary
vernacular which must be expurgated
almost in its entirety if it is to pass
muster through the ordinary channels
of the mails

  after ten minutes of angry conversa-
tion he jammed the receiver on the
telephone into place and turned again
to his secretary

  giveme the courier for to-day i
wonder if ive been making a bloom-
ing idiot of myself with peabody-
and hes old enough to be my father
no hes the idiot this is wednesday
the fourteenth of march just as i sup-
posed how could it be anything else

  once more mr watson tried to ex-
plain to mr peabody his regrets that
his philadelphia correspondents had
so suddenly taken leave of their usual
good sense in matters financial how
could an international banking house
like randall  co generations old fall
into such an absurd blunder it was
incomprehensible and much more of
the same sort

  on their part randall  co through
mr peabody the senior partner de-
plored the obdurate and plainly ridicu-
lous stand of the magnetic young finan-
cier who had risen in a decade from
the position of a life-insurance agent
to a world power in finance
h

the lost days

  your attitude is utterly beyond the
ability of any of us to comprehend
went on the steady tones of the old
banker tinged with subtle sarcasm
more than that it is illegal if you
are not really joking i should advise
that you see some alienist for your
egotism is evidently developing into
acute paranoia more than that sir
you are trying to club us for what
reason we cannot understand into pay-
ing youtwo million dollars in cash be-
fore it is due sir-twenty-four hours
ahead of our agreement and you not
only do not offer us any discount for
compliance with your demands but you
evidently intend through your iteration
and reiteration of an absurd and pal-
pably false statement as to what day
of the week it is to cause us to lose
a sum of money representing the inter-
est on that two millions of dollars
now we bankers sir-

  what in hell are you trying to drive
at exploded the new york man

  just this sir we bankers may be
inclined to accept suggestions from our
new york associates but by gad sir
we do not permit you to bulldoze us
into doing a thing which is contrary to
the established and conservative usage
of a house of our age resources pres-
tige and standing

    dont get you at all peabody
wailed watson

  then i will be still more explicit
sir the interest on one million of dol-
lars at five and two-tenths per cent
per annum which is about the average
which our allotment of the p c  i
stock will yield in dividends at the price
we have promised to pay you for it
means in rough figures about one thou-
sand dollars a week for the income on
each of the two millions or two thou-
sand dollars a week on the allotment
now sir for what purpose i am still
unable to understand you call us up on
tuesday and insist that it is wed-
nesday and we must complete the

agreement which has still one more day
to run the interest amounting to
three hundred and thirty-three dollars
and thirty-three cents sir which this
one day of time compels us to pay to
you for no reason whatever-because
two millions of dollars at the rate i
have mentioned brings in this amount
-is not a thing to consider ordinarily
but although that amount is a mere
bagatelle when the question of prin-
ciple is involved as it is here we refuse
to submit sir go ahead with your
threats sir and sell us out if you dare
to-morrow which is wednesday and
not to-day which is tuesday i shall
come to new york in person sir and
tender you bullion certificates payable
in gold on new yorks sub-treasury
and demand that stock

   you will howled watson

  i will firmly reiterated peabody
his voice trembling with the anger
which a gentleman of the old school
never voices at a distance from the
man with whom he is involved in a
quarrel

  well you old dotard exclaimed
the newcomer into the field of finance
youd better put your clothes on hind
side before and walk over here back-
ward when you start dye get me i
always knew you quakers were a slow
set of zobs but inasmuch as you
have started these personalities ill
finish them your name isnt peabody
-its rip van winkle and pm going
to throw that allotment of stock with
all the rights it carries on the market
in just ten minutes if you dont get
that jinx of yours by the collar and
throw him over independence hall be-
fore then

  you wont dare gasped the phila-
delphia banker

  wont i bellowed the now thor-
oughly angered watson well you
relic of the prehistoric period what
would you do if i did you couldnt
start a lawsuit even if you started
the lost days

ii 

out to file it on saturday youd wake
up when the new york preacher got to
the golden text and find out it was the
day after-and if you ever start to
vote for president this fall unless you
mend your ways youll be trying to
drop something with grover cleve-
lands name in the box por heavens
sake go back to bed and get your nap
out it only takes a few minutes
then get me on the wire make your
apology which  accept now and tell
me that that coin is waiting for me
when i want it which understand is
to-day do you get me steve to-
day  wednesday the fourteenth of
march nineteen hundred and umpety-
ump so long ive got to call bos-
ton

  once more mr watson hung up the
telephone instructing his secretary to
get boston on the other wire so that
he could talk to saunders  co on the
same subject

  say saunders he began when the
connection had been made havent
you overlooked that p c  i stock
matter the pool old man closes to-
day and by the argreement all stock
subscribed must be paid for in cash-
unless of course you want an exten-
sion what to-days tuesday siy
has the mania reached classic boston as
well as sleepy philadelphia oh get
out you are all trying to kid me
today yes ves ive had about
three hours of that guff from old pea-
body in philadelphia and im likely to
get irritated at any more of it from
you this isnt the first of april--

  watsons face took on a blank won-
dering look

  good god he cried is every-
body mad or am i just nuts for a
minute or two ill be chattering like
a squirrel if this keeps up oh cut
it saunders  say-cut it for
heavens sake dont you know that im
having too hard a time to get away with
all my work in this flotation of fifty

millions to stand for a lot of senseless
kidding

  he listened bewildered and then
abruptly hung up and hurried into the
office

  is this tuesday march thirteenth
or wednesday march fourteenth he
queried of davenport himself uncere-
moniously

  the old man peered through his
double glasses astride the bridge of his
enormous nose then he growled like
a caged lion and jerked his thumb over
the top of the desk

  watson followed the jerk with his
eyes

  there glaring at him in letters ft
foot long were the words wednes-
day march fourteenth

  he gave a sigh of relief and wi ped
his forehead

  aint you well roared the king
of financiers pulling an enormous black
cigar from his mouth

  i was this morning replied the
elastic junior partner now regaining
his equilibrium

  hows that p c  i allotment
coming along are they all inarching
up to the crib and taking their fodder
kept on the man to whom kings bent
the knee

  well to tell you the truth sir thats
what made me ask you what day it
was ive been rowing with peabody
in philadelphia over the wire and with
saunders in boston because they both
refuse to kick in all the local bankers
have complied with the syndicates
terms only three million of it is out
two million for randall  co and a
million for saunders both of them
however insist that it is not wednes-
day but tuesdav i dont understand

     mf 

it at all sir thats why i came to
you

  the lion of wall street emitted an-
other low growk then he sounded a
deep-sea siren through his nose

  feed it to the other fish he com-
n

the lost days

manded youve got an hour before
the market closes the next time they
want to get in on a good thing they
can set their own hen i wonder what
ails them they never backed down
before-and that excuse is the most
flimsy i ever heard of course its
wednesday lets go to lunch

  back in one corner of the office which
watson reentered to put on his coat
sat a huddled fuddled subordinate
william martin assistant secretary to
the financier and ranking next to
maury wilson was thumping his ma-
chine with celerity and precision
page after page of shorthand notes was
stacked up before him

  ordinarily of the most obedient and
plastic temperament to-day he was de-
fiant almost to sullenness

  he kneiv that it was tuesday and
not wednesday

  but with a dependent mother and
invalid father and a brother just mak-
ing the start into civil engineering
martin knew that interference in such
a queer mess would only make trouble
for himself without probably in the
slightest degree rectifying the error
arising from the appalling delusion
which seemed to thoroughly possess the
minds of all the rest

  so as a sheep before his shearers is
dumb he opened not his mouth

chapter iii

putting away the champion

 axky bob slixe fretted un-
easily in the luxurious parlor car
of the f f v limited en routs to
philadelphia he heeded not the long
lines of cars eastbound on the trains
of the pennsylvania nor the anxious
face of the engine and train crews as
the westbound limited flew by them
nor did he see the tense drawn expres-
sion on the faces of the towermen who
control the interlocking switches on the
maze of steel that bridges the ninety

miles between gotham and the little
quaker village

  its the last time ill ever try to
fight as a middleweight he announced
for the twentieth time to his chief
trainer chuck pratt who was anx-
iously watching him he rolled the
chlorate of potassium tablet that was
biting the mucus membrane of his
mouth and throat back into the comer
to enunciate more clearly

  dont worry soothed the man he
had spoken to think of the wel-
come youll be getting to-night when
the crowd rolls like the tide in through
the golden gate at frisco and lets out
the yell which shows the way they feel
at seeing americas champion in three
classes-the only undefeated man in
the world

  an me givin that grenadier burke
three pounds edge and dying for a
drink came back the champion with
a cross between a whine and a groan

  well retorted pratt i never did
see time pass like it has these last two
days i expected to easily get off that
last pound and a half long before you
weighed in at three oclock to-day but
it would never do old man to let go
of fifteen thousand dollars forfeit-be-
side seeing that twenty-five thousand
dollar guarantee fade away to say
nothing of the picture money and as
much more perhaps of the gate-all
for the want of a pound of flesh the
minute the beam tilts its us for the big
slosh and a fat steak then a little
sleep and by midnight johnny bull will
be counting out his bets in pounds
shillings and pence to the yanks all the
world over

  the pugilist sighed again leaned
back in the chair and closed his eyes
he talked no more until the train pulled
into the broad street station

  i wonder where ohara is he
muttered as they descended to the
street and signaled a taxicab funny
he aint here to meet us did you wire
the lost days



him the train we could come over
on 

  yes answered pratt signaling to
the small army of trainers rubbers and
touts who had debouched from the
smoker he turned to them

 were going right down to the
golden gate athletic club he ob-
served you boys better come along
and meet us at the entrance behind the
dressing room dont be hittin up any
slops now we need dear heads all
around for to-night

  to the surprise of the fighter and his
trainer manager there was very little
doing in the clubhouse men were
working in a desultory way here and
there putting up bunting moving
chairs around nailing railings into
places along the aisles and putting up
big placards showing the sections of
the reserved seats several boxes ri
at the ringside were also unfinished

  mike ohara with a group which
included one or two men from the camp
of the grenadier was gazing calmly
at the confusion they greeted the
american champion and his trainer
with considerable surprise

  thought you wasnt coming over
till to-morrow  said mike with his
welcoming smile

  cut out the bull retorted sline
nervous from his long hard prepara-
tion for the battle what would i
wait until to-morrow for-to let you
get away with the forfeit and have the
papers throwin the word hooks into me
for a yellow quitter how long be-
fore youll be ready to weigh in and
wheres that cockney who thinks he
can fight the articles call for three
oclock and its only twenty minutes
away

  ohara looked at them with incred-
ulity written large on his face he
gazed at pratt and then back at the
hope of all america as if unable to
understand what they were saying

  but the articles call for a fight on

the evening of wednesday march
fourteenth said he whats this
youre givin me this is the after-
noon of tuesday the thirteenth be-
sides grenadier burke is down at his
trainin camp at chester and he cant
get here in no twenty minutes

  back to joe millers joke book with
that jabber mike cut in pratt sternly
were here on the ground and right
on time like we always are this isnt
tuesday march thirteenth its wed-
nesday march fourteenth-the day
named m the articles of agreement for
the boxing contest for the champion-
ship of the world between bob sline
of america and grenadier burke of
england fifteen thousand dollars for-
feit has been posted by each principal
that he will appear on the day named
and also that he will make the weight
agreed on in the articles at three oclock
in the afternoon of the day of the con-
test both men must be in the ring
waiting for the gong at ten oclock the
same night were here if burke
doesnt show we claim his fifteen thou-
sand forfeit and also the ten thousand
if the management does not live up to
its agreement

  by this time the occupants of the
building were crowding around in in-
terested attitudes of expectation none
of the conversation was being carried
on in tones suitable for a prayer meet-
ing

  whats bitin you demanded
mike the bald foolishness of it cut
him deep of course thats the agree-
ment but we dont stand for no
rough-riders plays here bob even if
you are a champ-especially when you
try to pull something so raw that it
bleeds to be sure theres going to be
a fight-not to-night but to-morrow
night which is the day set in the ar-
ticles-wednesday march fourteenth
and that goes see

  for the answer the champion threw
the promoter a copy of the evening


the lost days

paper he had brought on from new
york it bore the headline wednes-
day march fourteenth

  get your man of course it goes
he said tersely come over to the
scales pratt its ten minutes to three
and if these blobs try to pull any of
this twenty-four hour bluff well grab
the forfeits and ill go out to chester
and kill that english boob for nothin
i aint goin to be jobbed out of a
purse and a championship by a joke

  now see here began ohara in the
strident tone of an angered man have
you fellows been doin your training in
the psychopathic ward at bellevue i
never thought you used hop bob

  ignoring the insult the champion
moved steadily over to the scales and
mounted them

  three minutes to three oclock
pratt said he you fellows come
over here and be witnesses he
beckoned to the followers of his own
camp

  they crowded around him

 the weight is right roared
chuck triumphantly just as the
boom of a near-by clock tolled the hour
of three

  the champion leaped lightly to the
side of the uncompleted ring he
grabbed ohara by the lapel of his coat
and the savage jerk ripped the garment
from the armpit halfway down the
waist

  look at that weight yourself he
bellowed

  ohara looked then with a sneer
darkening his face he called to one of
the men at the door

  phone over to the pound for a
couple of dog catchers and nets brady
and well put these canines where they
belong

 the opposing training camps
hangers-on would-be stars of pug-
dom and spectators tried to separate
the angered men then chaos bubbled

gently up through the floor and en-
gulfed them all

  crashing smashing cursing-they
wrestled fought tore bit and kicked
along the main aisle of the long hall
and through the swing doors into
chestnut street

  thousands of ladies children
youths and men of all varieties
streamed out of the nearby department
stores and office buildings a near-
championship fight had become a bat-
tle royal the dense crowd stopped
the street cars carriages trucks and
automobiles they cheered on the con-
testants even the patrol wagons
which came dashing from city hall and
half a dozen outlying stations to an-
swer the riot calls found it neces-
sary to send the reserves in on foot

  yowling howling groaning cursing
exclaiming the combatants resenting
their constitutional prerogative of set-
tling their differences in their own way
turned on their new opponents fists
met clubs the champion himself laid
three coppers down for the count
grabbed a club of one and threw it
across the street through a plate glass
window and into the right eye of one
of the most sanctified quakers of the
old school who still engaged in trade

  more police arrived these not un-
derstanding the nature of the difficulty
started in to quell the supposed rioters
on the edges of the crowd who now
numbered many more thousands
homeward bound or incoming pas-
sengers left their stalled street cars

 as the mayor was wondering
whether he had better not wire the gov-
ernor to call out the national guard
the crowd melted away from its suc-
culent center emerged fighting bob
no longer true to his cognomen his
science had gone glimmering before the
left swing of a plain policeman be-
hind him came the other battlers mike
ohara still breathing forth threats and
slaughter their respective cohorts
the lost days



undaunted and yet filled with the lust
of the corkscrew punch or the right
jab were each firmly gripped by three
paternal patrolmen

  the fighting phalanx entered the
nethermost depths of the city bastile
-and every charge in the criminal code
except arson and murder with a few
other exceptions was written opposite
their names then their captors went
back diligently searching for frag-
ments of equipment and anatomy which
belonged to the finest

  philadelphia had not experienced so
much excitement since the centennial
in the midst of it all appeared news-
boys crying get the latest extra
all about the lost day great confu-
sion and turmoil in new yawk f

  hey kid called smoke sayles
one of the seconds of bob sline

  he tossed the boy a penny and be-
gan to scan the headlines of the special
dispatches from new york the night
before he had slept in jersey city and
missed the party meeting a friend in
the train shed on the new york side as
he was coming to spar a few rounds
with the principal he had followed on
the next train puzzled worried and
amazed just in time for the last act

  for he too knew that it was not
wednesday the fourteenth of march
but tuesday the thirteenth

  somebodys done put a hoodoo or
a conjure on dat new yawk town and
on ebbery one but me he finally con-
cluded as he thrust the paper in his
pocket and started for city hall to see
how fared his friends

chapter iv

justice is jarred

vour honor said attorney robert
hart rising in gothams criminal
courts building with the usual de-
liberate deference and accent of a man
whose fee is large myclient will waive
the reading of the indictments for the

present plead not guilty to each of
them with the understanding which i
would like to have incorporated in the
record that i will withdraw the plea
later in the day and substitute in its
place a motion to quash them on the
ground of their legal insufficiency

  is that proceeding absolutely neces-
sary mr hart asked judge horatio
murphy with just a touch of asperity

  i so regard it replied the attorney
and the code gives us that right if
your honor desires instead we will
ask leave to delay our pleading until i
can prepare the necessary affidavits in
support of my motion to quash the in-
dictments i am not making this request
as a mere matter of form or to delay
the proceeding i am making it as a
matter of right and in all seriousness
and candor

  the court would be glad to be ad-
vised came from the judge if the
motion which you contemplate is based
on simply technicalities or some vital
defect upon which you rely it may be
that considerable time can be saved-
a very important matter with us at this
time on account of the great number
of cases which must be heard per-
haps the defect may be corrected by
amending the indictments on the
courts order

  very well your honor began the
lawyer my client lieutenant daniel
delaney of the police department of the
city of new york is formally charged
in six of these seven indictments with
the crime of extortion in the seventh
the charge is murder-as an accessory
and conspirator in the various events
preceding the death of isidore cohen
a gambler who was assassinated on
west forty-second street in this city
all of these indictments your honor are
said to have been returned yesterday
wednesday march fourteenth

  he paused to pick up a number of
newspapers and other documents lying
on the long table before him


the lost days

       i have before indicated judge
my preparation for this motion is nec-
essarily incomplete that is why i ask
for the delay but if i may substitute
the hypothesis which i shall undoubt-
edly establish to the satisfaction of the
court by numerous affidavits and other
corroborative evidence i have no hesi-
tancy in informing your honor and
the district attorney as well that the
indictments are fatally defective be-
cause no witnesses were heard on the
r named nor were the indictments
returned on the day named m the docu-
ments themselves

  whats that interjected district
attorney hildred

  i say that the indictments are fa-
tally defective because no witnesses
were heard on the day named nor were
the indictments returned on the day
named in the documents themselves
blandly went on hart

  your allegations seem to be frivo-
lous sir replied the judge impatiently
the indictments are dated wednes-
day march fourteenth they were
found yesterday in an extraordinary
session of the grand jury-at least i
was personally and officially advised
that they were returned by them be-
fore midnight of that day they were
brought in to me in open court let
tee see the indictments

  he scanned them thoroughly and
handed them back to the clerk of the
oourt as he removed his eyeglasses

  the indictments also bear a list of
witnesses upon whose testimony they
are based i cannot of course refuse
you time to formally file such a motion
sm you have indicated but i feel that
i must also point out to you in advance
that a plea of this kind cannot have
serious consideration at the hands of
this court in view of the known facts
do you contend that the indictments
were not returned before midnight

  by no means your honor an-
swered hart while he disregarded the

sarcastic smile which flitted over the
face of the district attorney and his as-
sistants but with all due respect to
your honor i must insist upon my mo-
tion as originally made and also say
here and now that this is wednesday
march fourteenth and not yesterday
which was tuesday march thirteenth

  he returned the joint glares of the
district attorney and the judge with
equanimity the chief law officer of
tlie country eager as the hound to
overtake the fugitive it has been pur-
suing was on his feet but waited re-
spectfully for the utterances which he
saw were to follow from the manon
the bench

  that statement sir commenced
judge murphy is certainly unworthy
of an attorney of your standing at the
bar of this court it is entirely outside
of the lines of professional ethics sir
it savors of the shyster and i am
amazed that you should utter it-espe-
cially with the hope of its being seri-
ously considered this court accord-
ing to its constitutional authority sir
must take judicial cpgnizance of many
things among them the political sub-
divisions of the country the records of
other legally organized bodies for the
administration of justice which include
not only courts but grand juries it
must also be bound by the commonly
accepted calendar divisions of years
months days and hours in all matters
before it for adjudication how then
can you seriously stand there and offer
an affront to the intelligence of the
court by such an undignified unworthy
and impossible statement of a non-ex-
isting condition

  the district attorney sat down again
satirically smiling

  with all due respect to your honorh
resumed hart i will answer that by
the statement that i not only assert it
sir but am willing to go on my oath as
a man and as an officer of this court
that this is the very crux of the whole
the lost days



matter i repeat sir to-day is not
thursday march fifteenth but to day
is wednesday march fourteenth

 sir- thundered his honor

  i demand the right to continue
yelled back hart if as i solemnly
declare and as i shall proceed to sub-
stantiate to-day is not thursday but
wednesday and if as i am willing to
further declare i can establish the
truth to be by unimpeachable evidence
that no record exists either of the ex-
amination of witnesses or the return
of indictments on tuesday the thir-
teenth of march then i contend sir
that these indictments are wholly with-
out the law-and have no legal exist-
ence whatever therefore vour honor

                                                         wt

is not only bound to consider any plea
in support of the proof of the facts
which i have repeatedly alleged but
your honor is also bound both by the
constitution of the united states the
constitution of the state of new york
the legislative acts which give your
honor a legal existence as a judge and
the oath of office which you took wrhen
elected-i say sir that your honor is
equally bound by all these fundamental
conditions precedent to your right to
judge matters brought before you-not
to decide a motion before the subject
matter of it is formally presented to
you nor to prejudge the facts them-
selves before they are legally before
you in the affidavits which i am expect-
ing to file

  the court does not need reminders
as to duties or powers from counsel
appearing before it roared back
judge murphy with ragedistorted
face

  this court is organized and obtains
its authority from only one primal
source quickly retorted the now angry
lawyer in tones which echoed out into
the street that primal authority of
jurisdiction over the person of my client
and the right to restrain his liberty be-
cause of the accusation of his participa-

tion in an alleged crime is expressly
conferred in the same document which
by terms also equally direct guarantees
to him the right of life and liberty un-
less restrained by due process of law
the various legislative acts based upon
that same constitution of the united
states and the other factors to which i
have referred define with an explicit
ness which even your honor cannot
deny nor abridge that he must not be
held for a capital or infamous crime
unless by an indictment or presentment
by a jury of his peers i say that such
an indictment or presentment has not
been so found i stand here in his
place as his legal consul by legal au-
thority and i insist upon the proper
legal consideration of his defense and
all matters thereto appertaining and
from that position i declare i will not
recede

  you are impertinent sir thun-
dered the bench

  i have no desire to be nor have
i any intention of so appearing if
your honor so construes my acts
otherwise innocent of any such idea
i can only say that i am prepared to
defend them

  your language mr hart is not
only indicative of a contemptuous atti-
tude toward this court but it is en-
tirely without precedent or reason i
am forced by the circumstances them-
selves to take judicial cognizance of
your attempt to impugn the diginity
of this proceeding and-

  this court was organized not only
to maintain the dignity of its proceed-
ings burst from the lips of the fight-
ing lawyer but it was first created
expressly for rendering justice to all
men before it-

  sit down sir

  the amazed throng in the court-
room officials spectators and fellow
members of the new york bar saw
the attorney reluctantly comply

  as i said sir i am forced to con-


the lost days

sider your contemptuous attitude to-
ward this court went on judge
mirphy and i hereby direct the offi-
cial reporter to enter upon the record
that on thursday march fifteenth i
take judicial cognizance of the same
without further proof it having oc-
curred when the court was in legal ses-
sion and in my own presence i will
give you your choice sir of apologiz-
ing for this motion and all your sub-
sequent statements or of being com-
mitted in lieu of such an apology to
the tombs for twenty-four hours do
you desire counsel before i formally ar-
raign you on this charge of contempt

  the tension was now near the break-
ing point the lawyer arose from his
seat and shook his spare head with a
gesture of defiance worthy of a cave-
man facing a charging dinosaurus

  there is only one lawyer in the
united states with whom i would care
to advise on a situation of this kind
your honor said he steadily his
name is robert hart under these cir-
cumstances i deny your jurisdiction of
my person sir i stand on the same
constitution which i have vainly in-
voked in behalf of my client i de-
sire to say sir that when a judge dis-
regards and tramples upon authorities
by virtue only of which he possesses
iower to assume the functions of his
office as you have done-that in such
a case i will resist an unjust mandate
from his lips-even if i pour out my
lifeblood upon the floor of the room
which he defiles with his presence

  somebody dropped a pencil it
sounded like the discharge of a pistol
in the utter silence which had fallen
on the room

  i will go further came in icy tones
from the man at the bar if i have
exhibited any attitude which you are
pleased to call contemptuous it was
as i have formerly tried to make clear
to this court unwittingly

  i would be most unworthy sir

of the high calling of my profession
which i have practiced with thorough-
ness and rectitude for many years if
i allowed the personal consideration of
my own welfare or future standing in
this or any other court to influence or
deter me from what i know to be my
duty

  judge murphy writhed in impotent
fury restraining only by the exercise
of his entire nerve force the outward
aspect of a semijudicial composure
the attorney went rapidly on

  since your honors last statements
since the threats of imprisonment of
my person and the shattering thereby

    yet been born except in the borough
    of manhattan

  these headlines faintly reflect the
first terrible turmoil which had tumbled
upon the metropolis only the merest
fragments of the resulting confusion
can be spoken of they were infinite
in number and in results reached from
pole to pole suits for illegal acts on
the missing day-mostly brought by
outsiders-blew in on the bewildered
clerks of the courts like a pest of grass-
hoppers then all new york papers
found themselves for twenty-fonr hours
without news from the outside world
their frantic telegrams to the depart-
ment heads of the great news-gathering
agencies in other cities like the united
press or the associated press as well
as the individual telegrams to out-of-
town correspondents brought such re-
plies that it reacted in a terrible pres-
sure to the editors in conference as-
sembled on every daily in the borough
of manhattan

  they filled their empty columns bare
of even cables from europe with freak
stories of the resulting confusion men
met on the streets gazed uncertainly
into each others eyes and either com-
miserated in common with their be-
wilderment or engaged in heated argu-
ments with those of the microscopic
minority in manhattan borough who
held to the same belief as people on
the outside

  one old chap well known along the
great white way whose hourly


the lost days

boast was that he came from the land
of blue grass fair women fast horses
and bully whisky-confided his suspi-
cions as to the sanity of the other men
who mixed their delicately flavored
whisky with various ingredients of a
less potent quality of stimulation

  i alluz takes mine straight said
he gazing fiercely around and no
matter how much i take im never out
of harmoney suh with the state of my
birth on a question of what day of the
week it is

  by this time the people who heard
him were so overwhelmed in the maze
of the occurrences that they had no
strength to argue the question the
kentucky coloners hope for a discus-
sion which might deepen into a quar-
rel and perhaps end in a fine duello
according to the code of the old school
of chivalry was thus sunken in the
slime of his own self-sufficiency

  nor were the idlers or the great ones
of earth-clothed in silken garments
and reflecting the brightness of the
noonday in articles of minor adorn-
ment yet who toiled not neither did
they spin-the only ones affected

  the association of gas and electric
light users served formal notice on the
public utility companies that they de-
manded an adjustment of their monthly
bills to harmonize with the calendar
of the rest of the country and this
too in the face of the undeniable fact
that the purveyors of these essentials
had furnished them during the mysteri-
ous lost day as usual to the vast major-
ity of the people complaining suit for
thousands of dollars was threatened
unless their demands were complied
with

  this cue was quickly taken up by
large armies of renters particularly in
the tenement districts money weighs
much to these people it is laden with
the heat of summer and the frigidity of
winter a days rent saved meant just
so much more toward food often in-

sufficient and clothing frequently in-
adequate

  salaried people on the other hand
were vigorous in their demands for the
new york schedule of time they
could neither see how nor why they
should be deprived of a day of toil
which their employers could not truth-
fully deny had been rendered

 managing heads of department
stores particuarly wrere caught between
the devil and the deep sea a days de-
lay in their orders meant short stocks
in the enormous volumes of many sup-
plies which every twenty-four hours
sees turned over the same was true
of the dealers in milk butter eggs
meats and other commodities all of
which must reach the hungry mouths
of millions on manhattan on time and
not a day late

 the shortage occasioned by the
twenty-four hours which had so inex-
plicably appeared and then vanished
into the abyss of the past caused a
new rise in these and other commodi-
ties particularly bread as the city
always contains many people out of
employment the hardship thus entailed
accentuated and deepened what was
called the social unrest mobs filled
the streets defiant of authority and
fearing the policemans club less than
the hunger of half or wholly empty
stomachs

  the situation was becoming intoler-
able when a public mass meeting was
called in madison square garden at
the suggestion of men whose initiative
always appears in times of public crises

  it was attended bv tens of thousands

s

tens of thousands more blocked the
streets leading to it in wedges of human
beings for hours other tens of thou-
sands drawn from the city proper and
its outlying boroughs hung on the bul-
letins of the newspapers whose extras
containing accounts of the proceedings
were bought even faster than the roar-
ing presses could print them
the lost days



 in the garden were men and women
of all conditions of life-from the presi-
dent of a great trust company down to
the jewish pushcart peddler of hokey-
pokey in the ghetto the presiding
officer the hon seton ridgeway who
had formerly been mayor of new
york spoke briefly and then asked for
expressions of opinion from the audi-
ence half of them stood up without
delay and demanded a place on the
platform

 all were unanimous in one thing
the city of new york contained too
many people of intelligence knowledge
property and general perspective of
life to be mistaken in the passage of a
day of time it mattered not what hap-
pened elsewhere the business life of
the metropolis was the pivot on which
revolved the fianancial welfare of the
country-it was the hub of the indus-
trial activity the source of supply of
so much of a material character that
its commercial supremacy had been
demonstrated since it was first settled
and the country must readjust the cal-
endar to the time clocks of manhattan
borough-or face the consequences
which would follow because of the day
they had lost

 the motion was put just then a
speaker leaped to the edge of the plat-
form and demanded recognition the
man was mayor bentley

  what followed can best be indicated
by the statement of the evening sphere

  mayor bentley is in bad again he had
the temerity to tell thousands of new yorks
representative people from the lowest to the
highest at last nights mass meeting that
he knew more than they the crowd did
not agree they whooped it lip for the
mayor who would not stop trying to tell
them they were all mad on the question of
the lost day which now dominates every
other subject in the lives of the people of
the united states the mayor escaped be-
cause friendly hands on the platform cov-
ered up his hurried retreat when some one
suggested that he ought to be hanged and
the mob took it seriously he is said to have

left the city disguised as a woman through
the subway his whereabouts are purely a
matter of conjecture although it is said
that he is hiding in brooklyn

  the motion was carried a provi-
sional committe of safety was formed
to protect new yorks interests it
had a membership of twenty-five hun-
dred of whom two hundred and fifty
were vice presidents and twenty-five
of these constituted an executive com-
mittee

  in spite of the resolutions there soon
began an exit from new york of resi-
dents of the island comparatively few
in proportion to the citys great popu-
lation but numbering at least twenty
thousand

  they left by steamers ferryboats
automobiles railways tubes and trolley
systems all believed the balance of
manhattan mad this belief was con-
firmed ten minutes from their home
for in jersey city brooklyn long
island westchester or any other place
outside of new york it was always
tuesday instead of wednesday wed-
nesday instead of thursday and so on

  in fact every one outside of man-
hattan was in the grip of the lost
day

existed and to dwell briefly on the dis-
putes which had arisen between arizona
and all other states and the borough of
manhattan as to what day of the week
it really was

  i move mr president that the rules
be suspended and that the following
resolution be declared the order of busi-
ness for the day

  whereas the difference of one day of
calendar time between that part of the city
of new york commonly called the borough
of manhattan which is a political subdivision
of the state of new y ork which is one of
the statts of tftis union has resulted in con-
fusion without parallel apparent violation
of the statutes which deny the taking of
private property without due process of law
and has brought about an intolerable and
un support able condition in the business re-
lations of new york city and the rest of
the country now therefore be it resolved
that the senate of the united states declares
the situation so existing a menace to the
general welfare of the united states and
fe it further resolved that the senate taking
legal cognizance of this situation and realiz-
ing the necessity for its immediate readjust-
ment in order that the general welfare of
the entire united states may not be further
affected hereby appropriates for the in-
vestigation of this affair by a committee of
six members from its own body the sum of
fifty thousand dollars or so much thereof as
may he necessary as an emergency appro-
priation payable from the general fund on
demand and presentation of suitable vouchers
to the treasurer of the united states for the
expenditure of the money necessary to the
prosecution of such investigtaion and be
it further resolved that such committee
as so appointed shall at once proceed to new
york city take testimony of its citizens and
such other people as the committee shall
deem wise in order to ascertain if possible
from what cause such confusion has arisen

                            to be concluded

dont mtes the ending of this remarkable atory order a copy from

                            your newsdealer at once

 or by any other method necessary and that
 they be further instructed to report with

 the least possible delay to the senate of the
 united states both their findings and rec-
 ommendations for the relief or abrogation
 of the condition so arising and now existing

   all records for speedy legislation in
the upper house were broken by the
necessary steps to pass the resolution
and to carry its provisions into effect

pointed senator alden pf arizona
was made chairman  the others mem-
bers were marcy of new york ellis-
ton of california hollister of rhode

terfield of kansas

  the committee immediately convened
and agreed to proceed to the seat of

  as the congressional limited drew
into the pennsylvania station of the
metropolis its individual members were
swiftly hurried to the hotel in car-

  they entered the lobby groups of

chapter iv

the story continued by margery
powell in america

there are a mort of little maids
that can compass their life in
six words he loved me he
rode awaybut that i warrant you is
not my way

  i am minded to start sooner and fetch
up later than that you shall have a
goodly foundation of three centuries
of powells with mine own pitiful story
laid atop like a shrouded corpse when
atb

we are gotten to that stage tis like
you will have heard enough of my poor
story to rest you quiet until the drums
set a beating for judgment day

  vso far i have traveled in a right
merry gallop of romance but the tears
are already finding their causeway down
my cheeks nay i am not of those
who can jest in the face of sorrow my
heart is breaking do but let me tell
the story in mine own poor way and
it will end the sooner

  this land of america wherein we
live is no mere pinprick like the eng-


the lost empire

land from which my forefathers set
sail three centuries agone tis a thou-
sand miles in a straight line and though
you went so far you might still not fetch
up at the coast

  i have spoken of it as america and
that is how tis named by us but there
hath always been some old wives tale
that tis some land of enchantment
never shown on any human map tis
said that when our forefathers sailed
from plymouth in the good ship ish-
mael in the year  scarce a hundred
souls in all they were beaten out of
their course by contrary winds and car-
ried far to the south of the coast whereat
they had purposed to land where they
fetched up no one knows to this day
but there was such a fury of roaring
breakers as struck terror to their hearts
and they tacked about and sought an-
chorage still farther south and so
they sailed along for many days keep-
ing off the coast for fear of shoals
until at last they came to this continent
which they thought must be a part of
america and found none tq say them
nay

  they drifted to land through a mass
of bright yellow seaweed that was
spread upon the sea as far as the eye
could reach for all the world like a huge
field of golden grain it opened to let
them pass and then clung so straightly
about the keel of the ishmael that they
could make no headway and presently
came to

  since then tis said that scarce a day
passes but some fair ship is caught
in that treacherous seaweed but never
a one save only the ishmael hath come
safely to land within the dreadful cir-
cle of the swamp lands

  we are like in the fullness of time
to breed two races here one on the
main continent a law-abiding people
and the other living on the edge of the
swamp lands prospering by wreck-
age and plunder tis said these wreck-
ers hang out lamps on high poles to

lure ships to their doom and then board
them in flat-bottomed craft slaying all
on board

  tis like that some of these great
ships would have matters of interest
concerning the outer world if we could
but reach them but some are too far
out at sea and those the wreckers have
plundered they destroy that they may
leave no trace of their wicked work

  i sometimes think the mainland it-
self is naught but a vast swamp that
hath gotten some measure of solidity
how far down it reaches i know not
but of a surety the water lies far be-
neath for many good fathoms between
us and mother earth we rock with
every restless fit the seas have and
when we have a storm tis under our
very feet instead of in the air for
there is never a breath of wind to stir us

  during the three centuries since our
people first came here we have grown
from a hundred souls to nigh upon
half a million or so they say which
is a terrifying thing to ponder fifty
thousand live by plunder on the swamp
lands and their crimes call to heaven
for vengeance some day the old
prophecy will be fulfilled and the con-
tinent will be swallowed by the sea
that hath builded it

  but i weary you with all these mat-
ters that have naught to do with mine
own story which i set out to tell i
want to pass quickly to the day when
happiness and sorrow came to me in
the same turn that was when i
stared through the gates of my fathers
park and saw my lover coming slowly
along the little lane that leads from
the village

  there are laws and usages aplenty
to keep a man and a maid apart but
what avail are they when the little god
sets apulling them together indeed
they are not worth a pinch of snuif
that meeting was but the first of many
i think we should have gotten to ring
and bells long ere this if it had de-
the lost empire

pended on godfrey and i could not
have served him with as many nays
as are spelled with three letters but
the same fate that fetched him to me
drove my poor father into the power
of giles de lorimer and from that con-
junction all our affairs went astray

  of a sooth the trouble was of our
own making my father had always
been weak when in the grip of a
stronger will than his own while i
was trysting with my lover my father
must needs bring to the manor house
a boon companion he had picked up
at the village inn after that i scarce
ever came back home but i found them
throwing the dice or thumbing a greasy
pack of cards over a game of ruffe

  i had not minded so much but that
i knew my father would never dice or
play with the cards unless he had a ven-
ture on the game and i feared that in
this de lorimer would meet him un-
fairly indeed there were black rumors
afloat about our visitor some said
he was but a wrecker from the swamp
lands others whispered that he
played with cogged dice and marked
cards wherewith he was doing so well
that he would presently be master of
the manor house

  to all these rumors my father would
give but a scornful reply saying de
lorimer was a gentleman and was not
like to chouse his host but indeed
twas not the winning of the rogue that
affrighted me but the cruel staring of
his eyes when he looked at me i read
in them the purpose that lay behind
his roguery but when that time came
twas too late to stay it if i had said
but a word to godfrey it would have
been out sword first and haply more
trouble to come for the villain had
ever a band of his own cutthroats within
call and all the time my father would
have it i was maligning an honest fel-
low who meant no harm to any one

  i had to wait until he had gotten my
father so deeply in his power that the

poor gentleman dared refuse him noth-
ing to have won the manor house
alone might have stirred the good folks
of the village against him for the pow-
ells had held the old place since twas
builded three centuries ago but if
the cunning rogue could win me as
well as the house why he might live to
enjoy his ill-gotten plunder

  and meantime all went so well for
him that he began to cast sour glances
at godfrey and would have had him
forbidden the house when i heard
that-and heard it from my father that
was become but the mouthpiece of the
other-i warrant you i walked out of
the house de lorimer was in the
flower garden and i told him to his face
that if godfrey went i went too and
he could make up his account with that
which he scarce found to his liking

  you are rarely fond of the lad
mistress he said

  and if i be i cried what of
it

  he dropped his pipe of clay and
ground it neath his heel that much
he said sourly your lover had best
have a care

  i think my scornful look angered
him harkee he growled this very
day i have won the last meadow from
thy father now i have but to win his
wench and my title deeds are as safe
as though i came from ten generations
of powells

  say so to my father and he will
bid the servingmen dust thy back wath
their cudgels

  i will say so when we have eaten
our supper this day he said furiously

  and at that my father came from
the house and i must needs run to meet
him hast thou angered him m he
whispered swiftly now harkee lass
this letter i would have you give to
godfrey tis something i could not
say to his face let him have it hot-
foot and if he asks thee the kind of
question little maids are all agog to


the lost empire

hear see you give him naught but
yeas

  and at that he hastened away as we
were come to that sorry pass he dared
not be seen speaking to his own lass
and i went along the path to search for
godfrey so my father had bidden me
i met my lover near to the seaweed
forest that is said to be haunted ever
since master hilles pickens the
preacher swore he saw a great bird fly
into it with wings that were like unto
boxes and a whir that struck terror to
his heart

  twas there i met my lover and i
have looked kindly ever since on the
huge seaweed-covered trees with their
little scarlet berries sometimes i think
he must have come from the enchanted
forest himself surely he was no sim-
ple gentleman like to my father for his
manner was above all of us and he bore
himself like a prince of his people

  he said he had no need to read
my fathers letter and thrust it into
his doublet and then he asked me if
 would wed him when he came back
from a journey he needs must make
to see his father i had meant to
plague him but when he had fetched
his speaking to an end he looked at
me in such a way as set my heart afire
and drew the yea from my quick lips
ere i knew twas coming

  we made our parting there and then
and the tears gushed from my eyes
so that i was blinded and when i
was able to look about hoping to
catch a sight of my lover ere he was
gotten too far i could scarce refrain
from shouting aloud in my terror
away in the distance i could see him
but instead of going toward the village
and the high road he was running furi-
ously into the gloomy aisles of the for-
est

  i thought he was distraught with our
parting and i ran after him calling
piteously until at last my limbs failed
and i sank to the ground no one had

ever plumbed the depths of that en-
chanted ground wherein he had run
so lightly but twas said to stretch for
hundreds of miles until it merged into
the swamp lands where the seaweed
trees had their roots in the water
that could not be my lovers home
unless he was some enchanted prince
that had been called back from his lit-
tle spell of freedom and happiness

  i rose slowly and stared about me
indeed i had never seen so wondrously
beautiful a place the trees towered
so loftily they almost hid the sky and
blotted out the sunlight there were
places where the sunshine beat down
until the path looked to be afire and
there were other places where there
was naught but gloom and shadow
and at that the thought came to me
that the powers of darkness had swal-
lowed up my lover and i should see
him never more i felt as though the
forest had a thousand eyes to watch
my misery my limbs dragged it
was as though age had stricken me in
a moment

  how i got back to the house i know
not my father was sitting alone in
the great hall staring at the leaping
blaze with his head sunk deeply on
his chest i remembered how he had
shivered and said that he was gotten
to that age when sunshine could no
more warm him and how i had bidden
marget the serving maid to light a
fire for him he turned as i came
in and i went and sat on the rug with
my head against his knee as i had
been wont to do when my mother had
first died

  what of the lad he whispered

  he went away i said dully

  what he screamed and at that
there came a stealthy creeping of foot-
steps behind us

  he went away to see his father that
is sick he saith he will come back
ere the new moon and then we will be
wedded
the lost empire



  did he read my letter 

  i know not nay he said he knew
what was in it and he thrust it away
and then he asked me

  it is too late he groaned

  he was distraught at our parting
and ran into the seaweed forest he
will never come back

  de lorimer broke into a cry of ex-
ultation behind us said i not so
he snarled the lad is naught but a
wrecker and a thief he goeth back
to the swamp lands to escape the rope
that was already knotted for his neck
tis a good riddance friend powell
my father looked at him helplessly
what hast thou to do with him i
said

  more than you have mistress he
drew on me but an hour ago and i
beat him with his own sword

  i went across to the wall where my
fathers sword hung upon a nail and i
took the sheath and beat him so lustily
over the head that he roared for mercy
and when i was tired i threw the
sheath in his face

  my father ran from one to the other
of us praying that we would make our
peace together whispering to de lori-
mer that he must keep godfreys name
out of his speaking whispering to me
that this false rogue had robbed him
out of hearth and home and could turn
us out when he pleased calling a plague
on the pair of us for that we made his
life a burden

  de lorimer took no heed of his wild
sayings but stood staring out of the win-
dow while i watched him curiously
and suddenly he came to us and
fetched a greasy pack of cards out and
flung them to the table we play
now he said

  now echoed my father and he
looked at me but i shrugged my
shoulders scornfully and walked away

  de lorimer cast no glance at me
we will dice to see who will first
throw a trey he said or we will play

at ruffe or trumpe or new cut or what
you will with the cards if i win i take

the wench to wife and you give us

houseroom if i lose- and at

that he smiled cunningly leaving a loop-
hole for himself

  but my father was already reaching
out a trembling hand for the cards he
drew back suddenly the maid is no
wife for you he said she will beat
you wheneer she is angered

  she will not beat me after we are
wed quoth de lorimer harshly
will you play at ruffe or noddy or
what do you choose

  nay said my father there is no
game like unto ruffe the coats and
suits are sorted in trumpe but in ruffe
the greatest sort of the suit taketh the
prize and that is what i like

  then get to it quoth de lorimer
sourly and at that there was silence
save only for the hard breathing of the
two men and the shuffling of the cards

  and all this time i sat on the window
ledge and stared across the flower gar-
den to where i could see the yellow and
red of the seaweed trees like a painted
forest sometimes i turned and looked
at the players who were crouching over
the table and thrusting the cards at each
other as though they were swords

  i think my father had meant to take
the desperate chance that he might win
this game and free us from the rogue
that had gotten us both tied up so
scurvily but of that i know naught i
only know that he stepped back sud-
denly so that his chair fell with a clat-
ter i came slowly across the polished
floor and de lorimer sprang forward
and clutched my wrist snarling in my
face until his yellow teeth glistened hor-
ribly

  you are gotten to the end of your
beatings mistress he said ere long
it will be my turn to give and yours to
take i will have you so tamed you will
creep to my chair and eat from my
hand


the lost empire

  he went to see his father that is
sick quoth i and i laughed in his
face

  ods my life quoth my father
the lass hath lost her reason she is
more like to go to the bowsening pit
than the altar

  i will wed her first said de lori-
mer hoarsely i will have her mine
ere that cursed puppet can come back
she shall cry mercy for every blow
she gave me and when i am done she
can go to the bowsening pit where the
mad folk are taken and wait for god-
frey boone

chapter v

the story continued by john cole-
  ch urch in st johns newfound-
  land

i had a confused impression that
some one had entered the room but
my mind was concentrated on a tre-
mendous idea that had suddenly gripped
me it was not until he spoke that i
realized mr boone was standing by
my side

  a penny for your thoughts he said
i came from my reverie slowly star-
ing at him in a half-confused manner

  has it any thing to do with the lost
continent he said wistfully

  yes i answered and he turned
away and walked to the window

  well  he said with his face
averted

  will you give a fancy-dress ball
limited to early seventeenth century
costumes a week from to-day

  a week from to-day that is just
three months since i returned

  that is why i want it to be held on
that day

  id like to do anything you ask
john ever since you came ive had
an idea that through you i would get
back to that lost continent but how
can i my friends are all scattered
at this time of the year some are in

montreal others in california others
have gone over to europe

  it is precisely your friends i dont
wish to invite i said hurriedly i
dont make this request lightly mr
boone you will believe that i want
to make up the invitation list myself
you will not know any of the guests
-except gervase

  he nodded wearily of course i
agree and then he gripped my arm
with tremendous energy everything
i have or hold is subordinated to this
search

  that brought me to the second part
of my request which was to inspire
him with the most absolute confidence
i rose from my chair and spoke as
slowly and deliberately as i could i
want you to believe mr boone that
at midnight on the night of this ball
you will be on your way to margery
powell

  i do believe it he said quietly and
then his voice thrilled with a sudden
exultation i have felt this day was
coming i have dreamed that you and
i stood in the great hall of powell
manor with margery behind us and
that rabble at our swords point

  just for a moment a sudden terror
smote me at the sight of such absolute
trust i wpndered what would happen
if i failed him i wondered whether
i would be able to justify my tremen-
dous promise what happened i dont
know to this day i only know that
confidence poured in upon me like the
coming of a mighty wave and he saw it
and leaped forward and clasped my
hand

  from that moment until the night of
the ball we sustained each other in a
trust that was superhuman it trans-
cended all human limits it had no lim-
its it was blind heroic faith that could
rise or stoop to anything

  the arrangements i had to make kept
me busy all that week i paid a flying
visit to gervase in montreal and se-
the lost empire

cured his eager cooperation and through
the good offices of some of my theatri-
cal friends there and in new york i
made up my list of guests

  then i hurried back to newfound-
land under ordinary circumstances
the pastoral beauty of nova scotia and
the swift alternations of light and
shadow that give the scenery of new-
foundland such a distinction would have
enthralled me i saw none of it the
train drove swiftly past great granite-
bedded hills rising sheer to the sky-
line through forests of spruce and fir
and in and out of valleys where the
sunshine drowsed warmly but i stared
out of the carriage window unseeingly
i had organized one part of my plan
and my mind was busy with the other
part infinitely more difficult

  when i got back to boone park i
had every piece of modern furniture in
the house removed and hidden away
i even had the chandeliers covered
with evergreens and placed huge torches
in the carved wooden hands that jutted
from the walls in seventeenth-century
fashion to receive them in every way
i made the place absolutely jacobean
even to the dresses of the servants and
the wines and refreshments

  from all knowledge of these arrange-
ments i purposely kept mr boone ex-
cluded he remained as much as pos-
sible in one room and when he had
occasion to go elsewhere i hurried him
through with his eyes downcast when
the great night at last arrived he had
not the slightest idea of the changes i
had made

  and all the time i preached confi-
dence to him at every opportunity it
was easy to do this for i had come to
believe wholly in my plan and my en-
thusiasm became contagious on the
evening of the sixth day i had him in
exacriy the state of mind i wished him
to be quietly confident and with his
nerves thrilling responsive to every
stimulus

  gervase arrived that evening from
montreal and took mr boone out im-
mediately after dinner which we had
in the library the one room i had not
changed they went out in the car
and gervase kept him going until day-
light broke so that mr boone would
have only a couple of hours sleep on the
night preceding the ball

  as for me i took a sleeping draft
that rested every faculty of mind and
body for four and twenty hours they
woke me in time to dress for the great
event it was just as important that i
should be tingling with vitality  my
fmger tips when midnight came as that
mr boone should be drowsy and amen-
able to the influence of a stronger will

  he and gervase and i dressed in
early seventeenth-century costumes
were standing in the great hall when
the guests began to arrive they had
come in via port au basques and st
johns earlier in the evening but we
had kept them carefully out of sight
when they were announced mr
boone was taking his first view of the
changes i had made and his eyes were
bright with the keenest appreciation
the blazing torches clenched in the
carved hands that jutted from the walls
pleased him particularly and then we
heard the bell ring and i leaned forward
to whisper to him

  dont be surprised at the visitors
this is a real seventeenth-century ball
and i have brought some real seven-
teenth-century guests speak to them
as they speak to you

  mr ben jonson and mr william
shakespeare cried the butler sonor-
ously announcing the first two of our
visitors

  ods my life i quoth the smaller
of the two men merrily he hath put
the cart afore the horse i will not
suffer this clumsy galleon to come
atween the wind and my nobility

  nobility your grandam said the
other pray you take no heed of this


the lost empire

pestilent fellow friends he is dis-
traught with the vapors of his own wild
imagination

  mr boone stepped forward with a
cry of sheer delight i would not have
foregone this meeting for a hundred
pounds he cried had i guessed
your coming i had made this house like
the field of the cloth of gold

  mr francis bacon  sir walter
raleigh called the butler

  and so it went on until all the guests
were assembled shakespeare and ben
jonson bacon and raleigh tom lodge
and marston and drayton and rare
dick hakluyt and even old stowe all
ruffling it bravely with their slashed
doublets and hosen truly the manor
house had never seen such a gathering
of the immortals

  the fact was of course that i had
enlisted the services of some theatri-
cal friends gervase advancing the nec-
essary expenses and they had come all
this way to help me in my big plan
rarely well they did their work and
the hall was bright with their finery
and rang with their merry quips and
laughter

  i never saw a man so much in love
with make believe as mr boone was
that night he laughed and jested as
though he had not a care in-the world
he talked with shakespeare and jon-
son of the theaters and the olde mer-
maid tavern and with old john stowe
about the history of the city he pledged
dick hakluyt the parson in a right
bumper of sherris sack with a mur-
rain on who treated jack sailor scur-
vily and then he must get raleigh and
king james i together and ask the lat-
ter why he had the head lopped off the
former in the tower of london

  and so he went from one group to
another breathing the very spirit of
the seventeenth century until at last
the evening waned and i saw that the
fingers of the great clock were close
upon midnight

  i made a sudden sign to gervase
and we went swiftly across the polished
floor coming up behind mr boone
who at that moment was standing
alone i remember noticing the tired
look in his fine eyes as he turned to
meet us and then i thrust him sud-
lenly under the hypnotic influence and
he staggered and fell into our out-
stretched arms

  we took no notice of the people
who stood about us but lifted him
swiftly and carried him into an inner
room and thence to his own apartment
there i placed him deeper under the
influence and when that was done we
carried him down to the secret hangar

  it did not take us long to complete
our arrangements mr boone was
strapped firmly into his seat and we
placed his hands on the starting levers
i sprang into the passengers seat and
leaned out and gripped gervases hand
for a moment we knew each other he
and i good-by and good luck was
all we said

  then i turned to mr boone who was
sitting as motionless as a statue with
his seventeenth-century suit hidden be-
neath a heavy aviation rug i called
his name and he turned slowly and
stared at me

  you know where you are i asked
him

  in my biplane

  what is the name of the country
where you left margery powell
america

  gervase and i uttered a cry of amaze-
ment what part of america

  i do not know i have flown all
over america from the franklin
islands to cape horn i cant find it
that is what they called it

  you did not call it america in the
account of your visit

  i did not wish to mislead you it
must be a mistake columbus landed in
cuba and thought he was in india

  i concentrated all my energies in one
the lost empire

tremendous effort of will power take
me to the lost continent now i said
slowly

  he lifted his hands helplessly

  place your hands back on the
levers take me to the lost conti-
nent

  i cant i have tried again and
again

  try again start your engine

  the air was immediately filled with
the whirring of the propeller the
great biplane began to move steadily
across the clearing it broke into a
kind of clumsy gallop on wheels and
then it swept up into the air at a fright-
ful speed

  i dared not speak one false move
now and we should both be flung down
to our death my sensations were
extraordinary exultation and terror
confidence and dismay all took posses-
sion of me in turn but the dominat-
ing feeling all through was one of de-
termination no matter how fright-
ened i felt i would not go back now
even if it had been possible

  it was a very bright night and i
could trace the broken coast line of
newfoundland with the great bay of
placentia right below me i could see
the steel lines of the railway stretching
to the northeast until they seemed to
run right into the little oblong of water
which i knew to be the harbor of st
johns and then the machine
swooped round to the west bearing
slightly in a southerly direction but
always keeping within sight of the coast

  we crossed to nova scotia almost
over the route of the reid steamships
going so swiftly that we made the pas-
sage between port au basques and syd-
ney in less than an hour and then we
swept over the bras dor and traversed
the gardenlike beauty of nova scotia
hour after hour passed and still we
went on we missed montreal alto-
gether because we cut across from the
western end of nova scotia to massa-

chusetts and from there we flew over
the atlantic states right down to flor-
ida

  mr boones eyes were fixed on his
controls and he seemed quite uncon-
scious of my presence i dared not
disturb him because the conviction grew
upon me that he was going straight to
the lost continent i was neither
confident nor nervous now but merely
fatalistic i had done my best the
rest was on the lap of the gods

  i dont want to weary the reader
with a mass of geographical detail we
flew from the moonlight into the sun-
shine and all through the long hours
of an intolerably long day mr boone
was entirely under my influence ex-
cept in so far as driving the machine
was concerned he ate and drank when
i bade him but even during that time
his eyes were fixed rigidly upon the
levers of his biplane

  there came a certain hesitation in his
action when we were past the penin-
sula of florida and heading straight
for the gulf of mexico but he drove
steadily forward and soon we lost all
sight of land again on his present
course the nearest land was at least a
thousand miles away-so at least i
thought

  i had in fact lost all trace of our
whereabouts and my only conviction
was that the lost continent must be
somewhere in south america there
was certainly no place in central amer-
ica that could contain a continent two
million square miles in area and
yet---

  what is this land we are approach-
ing i said hoarsely

  he did not even turn his head it
isnt land he said dully its the
sargasso sea the great rubbish heap
of the atlantic its a floating mass of
seaweed and flotsam and jetsam from
all the world i always avoid it

  he pulled the biplane round in a
more westerly course as he spoke so


the lost empire

that we should not fly over this un-
charted area where there was certainly
little chance of a rescue if we fell and
yet even as i thought no ship would
find us in that dead mans land i
saw far below us the hulls of countless
ships

  theyre not moving i said with
no understanding of the tremendous
import of my remark

  theyre all caught in the seaweed
he answered gravely the wreckers
go out on rafts and murder all on
board thats what de lorimer wanted
me to do he added

  turn the machine i screamed
turn it drive right over the sea-
weed  quickly quickly

  he pulled us back into our former
course without a word and we headed
straight for what seemed to be a con-
tinent of seaweed sweeping furiously
over mile after mile of the swirling
masses i recognized the swamp lands
and then the seaweed forest where the
upper branches of the trees were so
shrouded in the yellow weed that one
could scarcely tell sea from land

  and so at last we came to the clear-
ing where mr boone had made his first
landing he drove straight toward it
without any comment and glided down
on to the smooth turf as though it
were quite a regular proceeding i saw
the yellow seaweed climbing about the
gnarled trunks and losing itself in the
gloom overhead i felt the stealthy
quivering of the earth beneathmy feet
everything was just as he had described
it

  mr boone sat with his hands rest-
ing on the controls and his eyes brood-
ing thoughtfully i thought he was
coming to himself but i dared not risk
too sudden an awakening i sent him
off into a long sleep telling him to
return to his normal self

  that was about six oclock in the
evening i seated myself with my back
to a huge tree intending to watch while

mr boone slept but an overpowering
drowsiness crept upon me and i too
fell into a heavy sleep

  it was broad daylight when i wak-
ened in a sort of daylight i had never
seen before with great shafts of sun-
light thrusting through the trees that
stood around us and beating down
flatly from above away in front of
me the light streamed down a great
aisle of the forest turning the dull
yellow of the seaweed-shrouded trees
to the color of beaten gold

  the village is down that path said
a voice at my side so thin and weak
that i failed to recognize it and sprang
hastily to my feet

  the village is down that path re-
peated mr boone and this time my
alarm had a genuine basis his face
was flushed and his eyes were unnatu-
rally bright and his hands were trem-
bling

  ill be all right soon he said ive
been walking about im worn out
i feel queer

  but what does that matter he
cried with a sudden wildness in his
voice weve found the lost conti-
nent as you promised and margery
-- let us go

  but within an hour he lay in a rag-
ing fever calling passionately upon the
little maid pleading with roger pow-
ell heaping imprecations upon de
lorimer i dared not leave him even
for a moment we had a little medi-
cine chest and i did what i could with
that

  it was not until the morning of the
third day that he came to himself i
heard him calling feebly as i lay on
the borderland between sleeping and
waking and i hurried to his side

  im better he whispered i was
taken bad when we landed wasnt i
look here ive been dreaming of mar-
gery again and again i heard her call-
ing for help we must go to her

  its several miles away i said
the lost empire



miserably you couldnt walk as many
yards

  but you can leave me here you
can put some food by my side one
of us must go

  he was working himself back into
his fever i thought over the position
from every angle but each of them
led to the same conclusion ill go
mr boone i said

  you and i have got a stage be-
yond calling each other mister  he
said quickly and then he began to give
me my instructions as to the best way
to approach the manor house and the
stand to take toward the captain

  within half an hour i was striding
through the broad aisle that formed a
kind of natural highway from the clear-
ing to the village the place had such
a terrible reputation that i did not
meet any one until i came at last to
the edge of the forest and saw the
cottages and the turreted towers of
the old manor house

  i had left my aviation suit behind
and my suit of black velvet with mech-
lin ruffles at the wrist had only one
fault that its very richness fetched all
the villagers about me in an instant

  when i came from the forest they
were all gathered round an old woman
bating her in some uncouth way and
goading her to fury they broke away
from her to come to me and she stum-
bled after them cursing furiously but
no less eager than they were

  they made a circle about me as
though i were something escaped from
a show  tis a guest for his honor
at the big house quoth one huge fel-
low whose gray doublet and loose
breeches made somewhat in the fash-
ion of a boys bloomer suit gave him
an extraordinarily comical appearance

 they have one guest too many
aready muttered another angrily and
at that th old woman thrust her way
into the circle and stared up into my
face

  a great laugh went up here be
janet the witch roared one she
will read un like a printed book

  the old woman said nothing she
had turned away from me and was
drawing great circles with her staff in
the unpaved causeway

  she be muttering the prophecy
again screamed a lass in a green
frock and the crowd was in an uproar
at once

 stand back i cried roughly
ods my life what is the harm in
her foolish whimsies let her draw
circles till the day of doom and it
pleases her

  you know it said the hag ea-
gerly

  but she only peered into my face her
rheumy old eyes glittering you
know it she shrieked wildly you
be one of the strangers that come from
the seaweed forest you will tell
these greasy trollops that the day of
doom be on us

   tis a poor lost soul quoth one
of the men she has gotten some fodl-
ish rhyme in her head it may amuse
your honor

 when strangers conquer air and see
 when water laps the seaweed tree
 when sea is land and land is sea
 then the day of doom shall be

  it jingles rarely i laughed but i
did not come here for that pray you
tell me if i shall find mistress margery
at the old house there

  why now your honor hath thrown
the handle after the ax quoth the fel-
low sheepishly and the next moment
he was thrust aside and the old woman
was by my side again

  i was her nurse she whimpered
 twas the stranger drove me out he
would have married her but she talked
like the mad people and her father
stood him off but to-day they are
taking her to the bowsening pit where
the mad people are kept
io

the lost empire

chapter vi

the story continued by john cole-
churcii

there flashed across my mind such
a terrible picture of the manner in
which the earlier centuries dealt with
mad folk that i think  groaned aloud

  they are taking her to the bow-
sening pit screamed the hag if your
sword be aught better than a bodkin
you will use it now

  have done snarled one of the men
would you bring the wreckers down
on us this de lorimer hath a score
of cutthroats at his back

  what of that you be men too
thrust your great swords at her heart
rather than leave her in their hands
come she screamed is there one
of you that hath not had a kindness
from the lass

  that have i quoth one fellow sud-
denly ill strike a blow for the little
mistress

  and i roared another

  and i

  the crowd split asunder in an in-
stant they dashed into the cottages
around the green and leaped out again
with swords and axes and great oaken
cudgels i lugged out my rapier and
off we went with the old nurse shuf-
ling at our heels and stirring us to
greater fury

  the great hall of powell manor hath
a length of nigh upon a hundred feet
and in all this space there was but one
man to meet us he sat in a drunken
sleep with his tankard spilled across
the table and his white hair lying amid
the ale the noise of our tramping
and shouting roused him and he lifted
his head staring stupidly across the
smooth polished floor i think ye are
all mad to-day quoth he

  where is the little mistress
screamed the old woman

de lorimer and his men have taken
her they are gone to the bowsening

pit they were like to kill me he
whimpered they swore she was like
the abram men that seek pity by sham-
ming to be mad they took her away
a score of them to one poor lass

  he was stammering out his sorry tale
when the big fellow that stood by me
suddenly swung his cudgel and rushed
across the room let me to him
he roared hands off nay i shall
be ready for the pit myself if i listen
to him stand back

  i held his arm and the others helped
me there is better work to do
i urged the maid is in their
clutches where is this place they are
taking her

  the question spurred the nurse like
the clashing of a fire bell she ran to-
ward the door of the great hall at an
extraordinary speed her gray hair
streaming her years cast aside her
fury possessed the villagers they
streamed after her until she turned sud-
denly at the door and so cursed the old
man that they shrank back in horror

  in waking in sleeping in sitting
in standing in eating in drinking may
the curse be upon you she screamed
may you pine to death and be held
to life may your flesh rot and your
eyes drop from their sockets may
you feel the thrust of a hundred swords
every time you see a child without
peace without rest without happiness
may you suffer unceasingly until you
have paid a thousand times for all the
little mistress shall suffer this day

  she was out of the great iron-studded
door like a flash but now there was not
one who would follow her they were
huddled against the wall their faces
white their hands trembling the old
man had staggered to his feet reeling
and swaying and then he crashed to
the floor and was dead ere they reached
him

  i cared naught for him i begged
and prayed the villagers to go with me
i cursed and threatened them i urged
the lost empire



them in every way i could call to mind
but twas all in vain

  i could hear the nurse shouting
wildly but her voice grew ever fainter
and fainter and at last i went ber-
serk as the old norsemen were wont
to do in the fury of the battle and ran
forth alone to rescue the little maid
or die in the trying of it

  the sunlight beat warmly on my
face as i burst out of the hall and ran
down the path all about me were
growing the most beautiful beds of
flowers and the grass was like a soft
carpet to my feet but i heeded it not

  away down the path i fled with the
hoarse cries of the old woman always
leading me on until presently there
came a mingling of other sounds the
trampling of footsteps the cursing and
shouting of a score of men there
were two voices dominating all the
tumult one deep and threatening and
the other that i knew at once to be that
of the little maid

  ods my life said the rogue
harshly you near the end of your
tether mistress you meet your fate
lightly i doubt you do not think how
you are to pay for those blows you
gave me

  i would i had thrust the point at
you she said

  you will cry mercy anon you
jade you will crawl on your knees
and pray for pity

  i will pray one mercy first she
said hotly let them set me afore you
with a sword and i will abide the rest
there was a great roar went up at
that i think the wreckers would have
done as she asked but the fates chose
that moment to thrust the old nurse
in their midst i had gotten to the end
of the path and i saw her dart for-
ward clawing wildly at the throat of
de lorimer

  he stumbled and fell in trying to
avoid her and the little maid uttered
a cry of delight to see him so scurvily

treated the rogue was up again at
once his sword out and he struck so
furious a blow that the old woman fell
dead on the instant

  i had gotten to the hedge now and
was watching my chance to break in
upon them the berserk fit had passed
into a cold rage that left me cautious
i would give my life for the little maid
but not in a blind rush that only if
all else failed

  and so i followed them to the end of
the path where they stayed by the side
of a huge walled cistern five feet deep
in water

  who will bowsen the wench
snarled de lorimer the man that
leaps into the pit shall be captain next
to me with a double share in all we
take

  heart o me roared one of the
rogues ill bowsen her and in he
went going overhead in his reckless
plunge and coming up with the water
pouring down his dirty cheeks

  til take it out of the wench for
that he cried savagely and tis
plaguey cold here and ill take it out of
her for that too thrust her down i
say

  she hath still a chance said de
lorimer with a horrible kindliness and
he placed her at the edge of the cistern
with her back to it harkee mistress
they have haply not dealt with any
mad people in your time know you
what this bowsening is

   tis a better fate than wearing your
ring quoth the maid gallantly

  when my patience is fetched to an
end i will clench my fist so and i will
strike you so hard on your breast you
will fall back into the water you
take me mistress

  i take you for one that hath cheated
the gallows

  black simon will meet you in the
water he hath the heaviest hand of
all my troop and he will drag you to
and fro and thrust you under the water


the lost empire

and beat you until you scream for
mercy then we will have you here
again and strike you over a second
time and so on until you are come to
your senses or out of them forever
creeping forward i could see her
face it was deadly pale and the laces
at her breast fluttered a little tumultu-
ously i have heard all this so often
master cutpurse she said disdainfully

  he stepped back without a word and
swung his fist for the blow and then
r knew the time was come when i must
take my chance for good or ill ere
he could swing his fist forward i
stepped from my hiding and touched
him on the arm he turned slowly and
looked at me what in the fiends
name are you come for he growled
menacingly

  i am come to join your troop cap-
tain

  what set you on the budge he
sneered you are one of the gentry
by your velvet coat

  i doubt you were not bom in a
hovel yourself captain twas the
cards put me on the budge if you needs
must know i doubled the ruffe too
often and then i halved my fathers
money bags once and that was too
often

  you were a fool not to empty them
he said

  why that is work for two of us
i whispered eagerly if you are minded
to come as far-tis scarce twoscore
miles-i will leave the plunder to you
if you will give me a place with your
lads but i must be captain next to you
for my pains

  i saw the doubtful glance he cast
at black simon who was still in the
bowsening pit then tis all settled

i said a little louder you keep the
plunder for yourself and you make me
captain next to yourself

  what of me roared simon furi-
ously did you not promise me i
should be your captain  let me up and

i will beat a fair bargain from the pair
of you

  i do not suppose de lorimer was
minded to make me his lieutenant at all
he went to the edge of the bowsening
pit and stooped to whisper to the other
i think he was afraid to help him out
and he dared not say much to please
him because i stood shrewdly in the
rear eager to stir either side to a mis-
chief

  a plague on your whispering
quoth simon bitterly help me out i
say you are but filling us both with
lies tis all of a piece for a silver
piece you would bewray the whole
troop

  some of the rogues were looking
askance at de lorimer who was plainly
ill at ease and stooped again to whisper
to black simon i edged closer to the
little maid who was watching me with
hope and doubt playing across her face
like sun and shadow be ready to
run i whispered

  the quarrel between the captain and
his lieutenant was fetching to a head
they had forgotten us who stood
around and all the time simon grew
more furious

  you are no chief of mine he
roared at last when i am gotten out
of this cursed pit the lads shall make a
ring and we will see which uses bilbo
best tis cutters law that the best
blade captains the troop

  whereat i came closer to de lorimer
and made a merry sign to the rogues
that stood around and without more
ado i seized him by the back of his neck
and the seat of his side slops and flung
him into the bowsening pit

  this was a jest to the liking of the
lads they crowded round the edge of
the pit wherein the two men were now
fighting furiously i made a sign to
the little maid and we crept swiftly
down a side path and got clean away

  i liked not the way the villagers
watched us hurry away into the sea-
the lost empire



weed forest for they would surely
tell the wreckers but soon i had other
things to trouble me for the maid hav-
ing gone so bravely through her real
trials must needs swoon at what i
hoped was the end of them i fetched
a little water and bathed her forehead
so that presently she came to what
hath happed she said faintly

  why i liave gotten you safely
away i said that much for a start
mistress

  she was sitting with her back to a
tree where i had placed her when she
fell a fainting but now she sprang up
staring piteously at me

  when you are rested we will go
farther i urged  you are scarce safe
yet mistress margery

  you know my name she whispered
and you speak like godfrey

  let us go farther i said gently
it may be we shall find something
indeed i have left a friend in the for-
est and he waiteth my coming yet
when we are come i warrant he will
scarce look at me-if you are with
me

  she set awalking very swiftly into
the forest with her lips closed tightly
and her eyes shining for indeed
quoth she with a pretty curtsy i am
consumed with haste to see this friend
of thine i am only afeard my old
nurses prophecy will come to pass ere

i learn-what i want to learn-

  his name is godfrey boone i
whispered and at that we went hot-
foot i had my reason for haste as
she also had away in the distance i
could hear a murmur of rough voices
with now and then the stave of a
drunken chorus i knew that the vil-
lagers looked on the forest as haunted
and were not like to enter it and there
was no one else but the wreckers

  i doubt i can go much farther
sighed the little maid nay i am all

forspent can we not hide till they

pass 

  they were not going to pass the
voices were growing fainter instead of
louder and yet i had no satisfaction
in the thought i dont know why un-
less that in moments of danger the
senses quicken to dangers that are be-
yond their normal realization

  but the little maid knew naught of
that the tiredness was all gone from
her face in a moment her eyes were
bright again she stood with her head
bent not to the side from which the
wreckers had been coming but to the
other side

  it seems there are other things than
danger that quicken the senses

chapter vii

the story concluded by john cole-
church

hphe little maid went forward swiftly
and presently i too heard some
one coming toward us in that intense
silence i heard the soft padding of
footsteps on the heavy turf i heard
them drawing closer and closer until
the sound of them seemed to beat in
my ears

  and then i heard a little cry from
mistress margery such a cry as a
man hears but once in a lifetime i
ran down a side path i would get the
biplane ready for our journey

  after we were gotten safely home
i calculated that the place where the
little maid met godfrey and the village
and the clearing wherein the biplane
lay formed the three points of a tri-
angle the little maid and i came down
one side and met godfrey coming along
the other and the wreckers traversing
the third side passed us without know-
ing it when i got to the clearing they
were all gathered about the biplane

  i thought that was the end of all our
travels de lorimer and black simon
both somewhat damaged but appar-


the lost empire

entiy the best of friends again were
pulling recklessly at the levers to solve
the mystery and the others were no less
active

  but three or four of them stood a
little apart stooping over something
they separated suddenly and i shrank
back with terror at my heart i turned
and crept back swiftly along the path
down which i had come

  they were deceived by my quietness
godfrey must needs present me first to
mistress margery with the most exag-
gerated compliments indeed it seems
they had made a conspiracy to see
which of them could flatter me most
and now quoth he we will have
your news for i see you have some-
thing

  why we are like to stay here for
the rest of our lives i said grimly
the wreckers are all about the bi-
plane

  godfrey shrugged his shoulders i
do not think he cared what happened
while he had his little maid by his side

  we are not out of danger i told
him

  why as to that- he said very

happily and he cast a glance at mar-
gery and she at him

  i begged they would climb to a cun-
ning hiding-place overhead nearly
twenty feet over the ground and easily
reached by the trees as for myself
i would stay a while and watch what
the wreckers were doing

  i will take mistress margerys
tawny cloak i said quietly  tis the
same color as the seaweed trees my
black velvet stands out too plainly

  with the tawny cloak pulled closely
about me i hurried back to the clear-
ing the wreckers had turned away
from the biplane and were gathered
around the great bloodhound they had
fetched from the manor house that
was the danger i had seen and i
planned to draw the beast away by us-
ing mistress margerys tawny cloak

  the animal must have led them on a
false scent that ended at the biplane
and now it was casting about for a new
direction to and fro it ran with its
great ears trailing to the ground i
could hear it snuffling and mouthing at
the turf and see its bloodshot eyes

  it plunged suddenly into the path
godfrey had taken when he left the
biplane that would have led it
straight to the hiding place of the two
people i had sworn to myself to pro-
tect at any cost  left the path and
crashed into the heavy undergrowth to
head it off

  as i broke into the path the hound
came swinging round the corner scarce
ten yards away he lifted his head
and sent up a great bell-like roar and
i turned back into the underbrush with
the animal almost at my heels

  i got back to the other path first
but the hound was right after me whin-
ing and snuffling his eyes livid and his
jaws slobbering i turned and thrust
at him holding my sword with both
hands he was springing even as i
thrust and the point of the blade spit-
ted him so that we fell in a heap to-
gether before i could disengage the
wreckers were upon me and had beaten
me to the ground again they were
led by black simon whose uncouth
bellowings filled the forest

  bring un back he roared captn
will be like sunshine when he sees what
we ha gotten for him bring un back
i was taken to the place where de
lorimer waited with the rest of his
troop one of them was carrying a
length of rope he had taken from the
biplane and he began quietly to knot
a loop at one end of it de lorimer
himself helped to throw the other end
across a high overhanging branch

put the noose oer his neck he
said his face all twisted into a dia-
bolical smile this time we will talk
hang un first and then talk to un
growled simon
the lost empire

ms

  but de lorimer had his private in-
terests to serve where is the
wench he snarled suddenly

  not in the bowsening pit i told
him and the retort brought a roar of
laughter from the crowd

  you had best get to your hanging
capn quoth one of them grimly
this lad would unpin his shroud to
gibe at you

  gie un a chance urged another
let un fight fors life tis cutters
law

  then you must let me choose my
man i said eagerly i will fight
your captain or i will swing

  well said they shouted and would
have had de lorimer unloose me but
he only called furiously to the rogue
that held me to swing me up i felt
the rope tightening about my throat
and then there came a cry of surprise
and godfrey walked into the middle of
the crowd and after a little pause
came mistress margery very slowly
but with a fine courage shining in her
eyes

  godfrey cast away the rope from
my neck and so calmly that none could
say him nay harkee lads quoth
he  tis pirates law all the world over
that the best blade leads the troop
not here muttered black simon
surlily

   tis for you to make it so

  de lorimer stood biting his nails and
staring at godfrey

  if you let this greasy cutpurse lead
you contined the latter he will find
a gallows for you ere ever he finds a
pinch of courage for himself

  ha done growled simon take
your own sword and end him if you be
se minded

  godfrey said no more he threw off
his doublet and took his naked sword
in his hand and then he walked to de
lorimer and beat him across the face
with the back of his hand

  the ring was formed in an instant
  ioatb

de lorimer pulled off his coat with
some show of courage and laid his
sword against that of godfrey if i
win he said hoarsely i hang the
pair of you

  hant won yet said black simon
stolidly and at that de lorimer
turned almost despairingly to his task
and thrust at godfrey in a manner that
might well have ended the fight ere
twas well started

  the blades ran together to the hilts
and godfrey stepped back to disengage
i think the wrecker thought his enemy
was giving way for he attacked him
furiously he thrust again and again
but the thin strip of steel-for god-
freys blade was but a bodkin by com-
parison-followed his sword like a ser-
pent writhing and twisting to meet
every thrust

  then for a moment he hesitated and
in that moment he died godfrey had
been watching his eyes all the time
and at that sign of hesitation he sprang
forward in his turn and sent in a score
of thrusts that beat back de lorimer
as many paces and then he too hesi-
tated and seemed to waver

  the wrecker lunged wildly as
twas meant he should and at that mo-
ment godfrey swerved aside and sent
in so terrible a thrust that it left six
inches of steel in de lorimers throat
with the other half of the sword
snapped off in godfreys hand

  pass the captain quoth black si-
mon ill wager my next share of
plunder hell die no more guard your-
self master stranger

  i have no quarrel with you

  nor i with you grinned the rogue
but only one can be captain dye
see 

  and thats you said one of the
others we want no gentry to lead
us swing em up and be damned to
them

  they had already gotten the rope
about my neck again and were drag-


the lost empire

ging godfrey to the next tree when
the little maid startled us all with a
shrill cry

  the prophecy the waters are
upon us

  she was staring wildly at the ground
as she spoke from either side there
came a great cataract of water leap-
ing the clearing in which we stood
was high ground but it was already
isolated we had been so engrossed
in our own affairs that we had not
noticed what was happening beyond
the water was swirling amid the trees
that surrounded the clearing and away
in the distance we could hear it boom-
ing and crashing as though the whole
fury of the ocean were upon us

  the wreckers scattered calling to
each other to get to the village and
secure their horses i think they meant
to ride to the swamp lands where their
rafts lay but if so it was already hope-
less but of that i knew nothing the
water was rising swiftly as i threw
the rope from my neck godfrey and
i took the little maid between us and
we fought our way through the tor-
rent which was already to our waists

  we saw the biplane when we were
gotten to the end of the path and a
great cry of despair broke from us for
it seemed that our last hope was gone
the clearing where it lay must have
been lower ground for it was already
flooded so high that it took us over-
head while we were still a score of feet
away

  we must get there said godfrey
hoarsely the machine came down
on a little plateau scarce its own length
and the engines will be dry

  but it was beyond us and the water
was rising steadily soon the engines
would be submerged and that would
be the end of everything we could
see the great planes shining against the
sunlight with the water flowing along
their lower surfaces

the

   godfrey suddenly flung himself into
 the torrent and thrust his way toward
 a huge plank that tossed aimlessly
 twenty paces from where we stood he
 was back almost at once pushing the
 plank before him and calling to the
 little maid to throw herself upon it
 i plunged in and steadied it at the other
 end and the little maid did as he told
 her springing down and lying flat on
 her face on the great piece of wood

   we reached the plateau where the
 biplane lay and even as we helped the
 little maid aboard it came to me that
 the machine was only built to carry two
 persons godfrey was by margerys
 side in a moment with his hand on the
 levers and i stood there waiting

   the droning of the propeller rose
 above the swirling and roaring of the
 waters the great machine began to
 stir godfrey turned suddenly and
 saw me standing there get in he
 roared

   you cant carry three

   i must i wont go without you
 it was no time to argue i sprang
 in just as the biplane moved away it
 lifed a few inches and fell almost at
 the edge of the water and then it swept
 up into the air in one tremendous spring
 that took us a hundred feet high

   we beat steadily toward the open
 sea below us we could see the yel-
 low seaweed creeping above the tops of
 the trees with the water shining be-
 low away to the front there stretched
 the vast belt of swamp lands glitter-
 ing like gold in the sunlight but with
 great arms of the sea thrusting it aside
 in every direction the old black-tim-
 bercd galleons and frigates and wind-
 jammers the funneled steamships and
 the long-hulled yachts were rocking
 uneasily stirring from a sleep that had
 lasted in some cases for centuries

   that is the end of america
 sighed the little maid

soldiers and

strange devices sold by fakers
as military insignia

strange and weird devices adorn
the left chest of the american
soldier in uniform these days
along the line of the top of the blouse
pocket are displayed particolored rib-
bons of vast splendor and plausible ex-
planation

  the principal reason for their exist-
ence is that the government has always
allowed veterans of campaigns or
phases of the armys history to wear
such decorations in commemoration of
their services the reason that they
are somewhat ridiculous at the present
moment is that the army has not yet
published the specifications of the rib-
bons and medals which are to signify
participation in the military events of
the last two years

  all over the city unscrupulous or
misinformed dealers are selling a
strange combination of colors in verti-
cal stripes to soldiers telling them that
it is the authorized ribbon to show
service with the allies it is an
unsymmetrical row of colors intended
to denote the flags of all the nations
which fought against the boche an-
other decoration of the same sort which
is generally worn by men who ought
to know better is a red white and blue
ribbon which the wearer will tell you

stands for service in france it does
not-yet whether it will later depends
upon the action of the war depart-
ment the army and navy stores
inc an organization officered and man-
aged by officers of the regular army
has been seeking for weeks to get the
specifications for the proper ribbons
to show service on the allied side and
in france england belgium and italy
the designs are not yet promulgated

  the wearing of these unauthorized
ribbons by a man still in the service
means that he may at any minute be
halted by an inspector and find himself
in martial trouble it also means that
he is the patron of a faker a dis-
charged soldier may wear anything he
likes-even the badge which proves he
is a fakers sucker

  the badges which may properly up
to date be worn by soldiers because of
service in the european war are those
which show the officer or man has been
awarded the medal of honor with the
thanks of congress the distinguished
service cross the distinguished serv-
ice medal the certificate of especially
meritorious service or one of the for-
eign orders such as the french croix
de guerre

  general order  of the war de-
partment dated april   author-
ized the issue to every man in service
between april   and november
 soldiers and sailors personal relief section

ii  of the victory medal this
is to be

  a winged victory on the obverse
side and on the reverse the inscription
the great war for civilization and
the names and arms of the different
allied and associated nations

  the obverse side as explained in an
interview with general peyton c
marsh a few days later is to be signed
differently by each nation but the
face of the medal and the ribbon by
which it is hung from the pin clasp
will be the same for the soldiers of
all the allies and the united states
it will be as officially described a
double rainbow placed with red in the
middle just how wide the rainbow
stripes shall be and just how many
colors of the spectrum are to be in-
cluded in it has not yet been divulged
by the war department

  if a man has participated in any one
of fourteen battles which are set forth
in orders he is entitled to wear one
three-sixteenth-inch bronze star on his
scrvice ribbon for each battle if he
has been cited for his conduct in these
battles but has not received the medal
of honor d s c or d s m he
wears a silver star in the place of the
bronze star

  if a man has not been in action but
has served in france italy great brit-
ain russia or siberia he may wrear
a ribbon of a type which has not yet
been published

  the fakers are selling a blue white
and red ribbon under the pretense that
it is the french service ribbon for
americans it is actually a ribbon
authorized last year for men wounded
in france the authority for that use
of it was rescinded when the gold stripe
on the right sleeve of the coat was
adopted as a wound symbol and those
who are now selling it as a french
service ribbon are merely shifting dead
stock to easy marks

  by the same token every man who
has served in the army during the world
war will receive a button furnished
by the government to wear in his coat
lapel the fakers have buttons in a
hundred varieties the government
button which any discharged soldier
may have by showing his discharge
certificate at the proper recruiting
agencies will cost him nothing it
is a wreath surrounding a star with the
letters u s superimposed if his cer-
tificate shows he was wounded in serv-
ice the star will be of silver other-
wise it will be of bronze anybody
who wears any of the other gilt and
silver and a e f lapel buttons simply
shows that he thinks more of himself
and the fakers than he does of united
states service

extra mileage order won by
service men

  the private soldiers and sailors
legion has won its first legal skirmish
in the effort to obtain about forty mil-
lion dollars which it is claimed the gov-
ernment owes for mileage for dis-
charged soldiers

  marvin gates sperry national presi-
dent of the legion recently petitioned
the supreme court of the district of
columbia for a writ of mandamus
against general herbert m lord di-
rector of finance of the war depart-
ment to compel him to reimburse them
the difference between three and a half
cents a mile each as allowed and five
cents per mile which was authorized
by the last congress

  chief justice mccoy has issued the
following order

the relation of marvin gates sperry
petitioner versus herbert m lord di-
rector of finance general staff war
department respondent

  upon consideration of the petition
in the above-entided cause it is this

fifth day of may  ordered that a
rule issued to the respondent requiring
him to show cause on the ninth day of
may instant at the opening of the
court why the writ of mandamus as
prayed by the said petition should not
issue provided that a copy of this rule
is served on the said respondent on or
before the day of may instant

  former congressman ernest lun-
deen of minnesota is counsel for the
legion

  none of the officers of the legion
nor myself receive a penny for our
services he said we are simply all
working together for the rights in this
case of the private soldiers and sailors

  it is no attempt to harass any one
the boys were paid off at the rate of
three and one-half cents per mile
congress granted them five cents per
mile it will average about ten dollars
due each and every soldier on the
basis of four million troops you will
see then it would run up into big fig-
ures-some forty million dollars but
it is their due and it is all we are after

gets what is coming to him it was
the privates that won the war and you
might say that they are again victorious

what is thein legal due

questions and answers

  private r b s-could you advise
me on the proper method to secure
my discharge i am a mechanic and
i have an excellent position waiting for
me in civil life i have spoken to the
top sergeant but so far nothing has
happened this is a serious matter
with me because i wish to get married
after my discharge

  answer the only way to do busi-
ness in the army is to follow regula-
tions write a military letter through
channels requesting that you be dis-

charged give the reasons for same
as briefly and simply as possible talk
to your company clerk and learn the
exact method of writing a military let-
ter i will send you a model if you
require it moss army paper work
gives good samples follow instruc-
tions carefully and address your com-
munication to your immediate com-
manding officer with the request that
it be forwarded through military chan-
nels to the proper authority

  interested-could you inform me
as to the number of casualties suffered
by the united states during the war

  answer the approximate number
is about  i cannot give exact
figures because every now and then the
war department announces a new list
w atch the papers and you will secure
this information

  corporal alec r-in answer to
your request i must say that it is im-
possible for me to tell you when any
given unit will be mustered out ad-
dress such requests to the war depart-
ment

  curious-i have been discharged
for three months and recently tried to
secure a job another discharged sol-
dier beat me to it on the grounds that
he had been across i was a volunteer
myself and i would have gladly gone
over but unfortunately was never sent
i put in two solid years what would
you do

  answer this is a hard problem i
would hesitate to choose between the
relative merits of you two men because
i have never met either one of you
my advice would be to go somewhere
else perhaps the man- you speak of
had been introduced by a friend you
may not have been known where you
tried to secure employment if you
dont succeed in getting a place take the
matter up with the u s employment
service the red cross salvation
army or the y m c a there ts
io soldiers and sailors personal relief section

a jewish welfare league that is also
doing good work for discharged sol-
diers

  discharged-i am in a peculiar
position i was discharged recently as
a lieutenant and accepted work under a
man who was at one time a private in
my company he is taking advantage
of his opportunities to lord it over me
and i wonder whether i should resent
the matter or merely ignore it

  answer this is a problem i am
afraid i shall have to leave the settle-
ment entirely with you because you
know best about the position you hold
a number of these cases have been re-
ported to me during the past few
months i can only say that life has
a peculiar habit of reversing conditions
every now and then

  bertrand l d-i have been dis-
charged for five months and during this
time accepted three separate positions
each one proving tiresome i am un-
married and without relatives i have
thought for some time of going back
into service please give me some
pointers i am an experienced ma-
chinist and know a great deal about
electricity in an amateur way i saw
foreign service and was a non-com
when discharged

  answer it would seem to me that
the best thing for you to do would be
to enter service again there is a good
living and an excellent future for a man
in the army if he likes the life i do
not know of any one i respect any more
than the older non-com who has four
or five fogies to his credit the army

is going to be a much better place for
a man with ambition in the future the
war has taught us many things if
you are happy as a soldier and think
that it provides a living to your satis-
faction i would without hesitation rec-
ommend reenlistment

  roy le moyne-i saw active service
and in one of the last engagements was
unfortunate enough to lose my leg as
you know i have contributed some
things to the thrill book in the
form of prose and verse i am not
unknown to ytiu therefore i am re-
ceiving no money from the government
and i am experiencing difficulty in
securing a position it seems to me that
i am entitled to a regular sum from
uncle sam because i lost my limb in
action and not as the result of any
carelessness on my part can you ad-
vise me

  answer my dear friend le moyne
i want to say first that i have enjoyed
your verses greatly and i hope that
more of them will appear in the
thrill book now about your trou-
ble you should sit right down and
write to the bureau of war risk in-
surance claims section it is not nec-
essary to hire a lawyer simply lay
your case before them inclosing a copy
of your discharge certified by a notary
public explain every point that you
can think of and be sure and give your
unit period of service where wounded
action taken if any et cetera the
bureau will furnish you with forms
if you fail in this write me again and
i will see what i can do for you
how seldom a writer succeeds in
describing the emotions of a
child we have read a great
many stories dealing with children and
have been disheartened at their utter
lack of understanding the fact is that
the infant mind is capable of thinking
about things in a way that would sur-
prise the old-maidish story-tellers it
isnt necessary to go die limit and make
children into grown-ups either that
was why we were pleased to get hold
of the wax doll by ezra putnam
with fine taste and amazing knowledge
this writer has made a child the main
figure in a tale that is both unusual and
pathetic confidentially we must ad-
mit that we do not like to read gloomy
fiction all the time but now and again
when we strike a bit of work that is so
good we cannot decline to publish it
we are not going to let anything stand
in its way the thrill book is the
one magazine where the extraordinary

story is given first place our ideal is
to forget all the other periodicals and
give our readers the kind of reading
matter that it is impossible to find any-
where else

the opium ship by h bedford-
 jones ends in the next issue if
you havent been reading this serial we
certainly advise you to secure the back
numbers or glance through the synop-
sis in this number and begin it at once
if you cant get back numbers from
your news dealer write to us for them

in the next issue of the thrill book
we are going to print a complete
novel by william wallace cook called
the man from thebes it is not
necessary to introduce william wallace
cook he is a writer whose work has
been before the public for many years
we are not sparing time or expense to
secure for you the best that can be

cross-trails

found anywhere it is an amusing tale
of how patent medicines restored life
to an egyptian king you will enjoy
his exciting adventures and the many
curious things that happen to a man
who has been dead for twenty-five hun-
dred years

ne of the important policies of the
thrill book is to secure the best
serials that we can get we dont want
the usual tales that appear regularly
in other magazines what would be
the use what we are keen to find
are those that are entirely out of the
rut into which modem fiction has fallen
francis stevens has written one begin-
ning in the next number that for amaz-
ing situations and bizarre plot is not to
be duplicated it is called the heads
of cerberus go to your news dealer
at once and order a copy so that you
wont miss a line of it if you have
ever read edgar allan poes the nar-
rative of a gordon pym and liked it
as much as we did you will appreciate
a serial that goes even beyond that
and instead of going to the south pole
carries one to an unknown land where
people are numbered rather than named
and where everything that we are ac-
customed to seeing around daily is re-
versed the interesting thing about it
all is the atmosphere of probability that
surrounds the entire tale from begin-
ining to end we enjoy reading a good
story more than anything else we can
think of at this moment but when the
story holds us spellbound we thank our
stars that there are some writers who
know the game

you will read a great many letters in
this issue from our readers since
march i st when the initial number ap-
peared on the news stands we have
received over three thousand letters

so far not one reader has failed to
understand the ideal that carries us on
it was such an unusual venture that for
a long time we were not able to make
writers believe that at last there was
a magazine that dared print mysteri-
ous pseudo scientific occult fantastic
and bizarre yams when we con-
vinced them that we were serious we
began getting what we wanted read
when dead lips speak by anna
alice chapin in this number and let
us know whether you have ever run
across a more startling thing also
the fear by carleton w kendall
and the kiss of the silver flask by
evangeline weir it is a lot of pleasure
to bring to our readers stories of so
high a caliber after all the workman
is proud of a task well done

ur readers will recall that in our
last issue we published a short
story called the whispering from the
ground by don mark lemon a grip-
ping little tale with a unique denoue-
ment the spider and the fly by
the same author is an even more strik-
ing story of the weird the fantastic
the horrible read it with several
hours intervening between its conclu-
sion and your bedtime for othenvise
you will undoubtedly pass an uncom-
fortable night it is a story of a woman
who turns into-well of course we
are not going to tell you because if
we did you would miss the pleasure
and the excitement of finding that out
for yourself but remember give
vourself four or five hours before bed-
time so that your nerves have a chance
to steady themselves

how about it

the consciousness of ones own indi-
viduality is not a simple thing to
attain do you realize that the most

from all over the world many of
them have praised our work others difficult object of human ambition is
have criticized us in a serious way but  an adjusted idea of self
cross-trails



  we take ourselves quite seriously
the last thing in the world that we
see is a fault of our own it is easy
enough to pick the mote out of our
neighbors eye

  we can sit back in righteous ease
and select at random the glaring weak-
ness of those around us but when it
comes to self-appraisal we fail miser-
ably

  we lack the power to stand off and
view ourselves objectively why
simply because most of us have neg-
lected doing so for no other reason than
the fact that we considered it unnec-
essary we are content to drive along
in the same old harness down the un-
changing road at a snails pace never
looking behind us and never lifting our
heads to look beyond suddenly some-
thing hits us an accident of some
kind occurs our harness is tom from
our backs the unseen driver disap-
pears or is killed we are left stranded
on the roadway dazed uncertain
pushed to one side while the traffic
rushes by in utter ignorance of our
plight how pitiful

  had we taken the time to study our-
selves we would have known all there
was to know about who drove us the
kind of harness we wore and the road-
way down which we cantered at a lazy
pace we would not have depended
upon circumstances so utterly and com-
pletely we could have taken what
lay at hand and made a harness or left
it behind us for good and all and taken
to the highway free determined to
stand upon our own good feet

  the study of self is the best way to
begin a bit of work if you take a
position get a slant on your own re-
sponsibilities and a knowledge of what
you are able to accomplish know
yourself from stem to stem

  after you have learned all you can
about yourself take the rest for granted
and go ahead full speed in other

words if an occasion arises where you
are called upon to do something beyond
your understanding of your own powers
take a chance often the use of un-
known powers brings them out

  i hold a theory that in every man
or woman there are innate all the
powers of the race chance opportun-
ity or fate-call it what you will-
cuts largely in bringing them out but
the greatest force is will

  what we will we can do carry this
farther you can actually create
powers out of the shadowy beginnings
of initiative that stir within you

  i could prove this if i take the time
but i will suggest a method for you
to try which will convince you of the
truth of the above if you obey my in-
structions exactly

  let us say you are a clerk in an
office suddenly the man above you is
taken sick and you are called upon to
take his place now dont go in fear
in trembling to his desk approach it
as though you knew all there was to
be known about tfte work you will
be surprised at the ease with which
things open to a courageous mind also
the other clerks will help you when
they observe that you possess self-con-
fidence suppose you did fail-what
of it  are there not hundreds of other
chances say this to yourself

  you will find that in you there are
lying magical forces of strength that
have been waiting for an opening to
spring into being

  naturally if you allow yourself to
go to sleep and lose all ambition there
will come a time when the forces will
die within you and you will be unable
to get out of the rut

  i would advise every minor clerk
who reads these pages every mechanic
every workman every professional
man to take one chance one leap into
the unknown just to see what it brings
forth if he tries this and fails i wffl


cross-trails

be glad if he will write to me i guar-
antee that if he is candid and tells me
the truth about himself i will be able
to point out to him a way by which he
can win the next time

  i wish to say here that often a mans
weaknesses are the best things he has
the thing that counts is the policy fol-
lowed by the will to carry out this sys-
tem of what you believe you should do

  how interesting it is to open up ones
personality and dig down to find out
what lies there unseen previously it
is so easy observe your own actions
weigh your successes and failures in
equal scales dont close your mind
to any opening dont listen to carp-
ing criticism dont worry too much
about the other fellow

 dont waste time in trying to do
something that you dont like dont
hunt up uncongenial companions find
your own set and pick out the best
and stand by them

  dont regard your opinion of your-
self as too high as you regard your-
self so shall the rest dont be afraid
of the darkness try anything once
if it doesnt work dont do it the second
time unless you are sure you did not
make a real attempt

  dont go home and forget your work
if its that kind of work then you are
not placing your personality in the
proper niche dont stand around ar-
guing with unsuccessful people find
those who succeed study them and
compare yourself then dont run
away frightened

interesting letters from the
readers

  dear sir to pass a dull evening i re-
cently picked up a copy of jour new maga-
zine the thrill book march th copy

it and enjoyed it every step of the way it
all copies are as good as that one i am sure
you will grow fast

  sales manager chase brothers co roch-
ester n y

  gentlemen  i understand you are about
to publish a magazine to be called the
thrill book if so the green eye
the incloscd story may fit very well i
guarantee the reading of it will give a thrill
of some variety

  the green eye was not written with a
belief of its selling there is hardly i think
an american publication that would accept it
with the possible exception of your new
magazine

  pretty-pretty tinkle-tinkle happy-ending
wedding-chimes slush-gush and pifbe
thats whats wanted

  bah

  when are american editors going to try
and lift the reading public to an appreciation
of something besides literary garbage

  i believe the thrill book will make a
decided appeal to the thousands who are sick
of the drivel the magazines have been of-
fering

  i hope the shop talk i hear about the
thrill book is trne

 anyway please look over the green
eye

  it made two editors write me letters about
it of course they were obliged to reject it
their magazines stand for the mush a cer-
tain type of mentality  gorges sincerely

  im glad to know theres such a magazine
out as the thiill bok i have often
wondered doubtless like thousands of other
people why one could never find a magazine

is really a story to my mind the more
mystery the greater the fascination in art

  it is good news that you intend running a
department of letters from readers a de-
partment of that sort surely does tend to
make firm adherents of many readers who
would otherwise never see themselves in

  dear sir permit me to felicitate with
you on your unique departure from estab-
lished methods in providing entertainment
for the reading public although a woman
i fail to see any point or purpose in half the
usual magazine stories being published nowa-
days they are weak lame insipid dis-
torted efforts thinly veneered junk which
might find better destiny in a wastebasket
than in a magazine

  any one who thinks a woman doesnt like
red-blooded stories with the tang of mystery
thrilling adventures ghostly horror and the
lure of the occult doesnt know the feminine
mind the sickly sentimental stuff is nauseat-
ing-we get so much of that without need-
ing a magazine give us live-wire stories
make us realize that we are human not
mere petticoated dolls you are doing good
work along different lines and i must com-
pliment you i look for the discovery of a
new poe or maupaussant or obrien in your
wonderfully timely magazine although i
would like to see it larger

robert w sneddon harcourt farmer tod

among my special favorites the best story
so far is the bibulous baby by tod rob-

but dust by frederic booth was a hum-
mer  recall now that his supers was se-
lected by obrien as one of the best stories

area

  the expenditure of more than -
 francs--in the re-
organization of communication in north-
eastern france is planned by albert cla-
veille minister of public works in a
report to president poincare the minister
says that more than  francs
should be expended for the construction
of new main railroad lines more than
 franes for the construction
of local railway lines more than -
 francs for the reconstruction of
waterways more than  francs
for building and rebuilding roads and
more than  for the reconstruc-
tion and improvement of maritime ports

  in the fighting area of northern france
great stretches of railway lines were de-
stroyed and must be rebuilt as must most
of the tunnels all local railway lines
have been destroyed in the regions of
rheims and laon the canal system in
the battle area also was damaged con-
siderably  bridges and  floodgates
being destroyed the ports of dunkirk
calais and boulogne were damaged to
the extent of  francs the
losses in machinery in the occupied area
amounted to more than  francs

  reconstruction and improvements are

church furnace acts as incubator

  reverend hadley alfredton pastor of
the central church of dallas texas likes
his eggs three times daily in fact he is
so fond of the hen fruit that his sagacity
ld him to store away some thirty dozen
perfectly good eggs gathered from his
barnyard during the laying season to
guard against the time when his fowls

were not on the job these eggs he
stored in the basement of his little church
where they would be safe from molesta-
tion

  every day or so during the past month
reverend alfredton visited the basement
of the church and brought out eggs then
he was called away for a time he left
positive instructions to the janitor to
keep the building warm and his family
comfortable during his absence

  when reverend alfredton returned he
went to the basement of the church to get
eggs for his evening meal right then he
got the surprise of his life

  instead of finding more than twenty
dozen eggs as he had left them he found
two hundred nice downy little chickens
chirping from the ground and the egg
cases

  he made an investigation every case
was full of chicks they were singing a
song of hunger and wanted a place to
snuggle under the wing of a hen

woman in rowboat tries to cross sea

 speaking of those women who have
nerve to spare but whose judgment may
be deficient consider victoria neilsen
who actually began an attempt to row
across the atlantic ocean in a fifteen-
foot boat she was brought back but
there is every likelihood that she will
repeat the attempt unless they catch her
again

 well past middle age and extremely
powerful for a woman mrs neilsen who
is a dane was pulling lustily to the east-
ward and was well out when picked up
by the crew of the steam pilot boat
new york she simply longed to see
that dear denmark the land of her birth
but with only twenty-five dollars to her
name she couldnt buy a ticket although
homesick and poor she had nerve and
plenty of it with her little twenty-five
dollars she bought a good row boat and
started for denmark


around the world

  when the pilot crew picked her up she
was ten miles past the sandy hook light-
ship at the other end of new york bay
nobody asked them to interfere hut
when they saw a woman rowing out to
sea in a little boat they concluded that
something must be wrong with the
woman

  they took her to a hospital at staten
island where she was placed under sur-
veillance while preparations were being
made to transfer her to the observation
ward of another hospital she disappeared
now the police are watching for her lest
she obtain another rowboat and again
defy the atlantic ocean

gold found in jar of preserves

  a jar of plum preserves put up by her
mother in mississippi more than fifty
years ago proved to be one of the sweet-
est and most welcome dishes mrs j l
conkling of greenville texas ever
opened for breakfast that jar of pre-
serves was a dish for the gods and there
are many demigods and just plain ordi-
nary citizens who wish they had the
entire jar or just enough of the preserves
to spread on a slice of bread

  mrs conkling brought the preserves
with her when she moved from missis-
sippi several years ago along with it
came numerous other jars of good old
fruit her mother canned right after the
civil war the family had been eating
the fruit with the greatest relish

 well john i think i have some of
those good old preserves mother put up
said mrs conkling to her husband

  she fussed at the top for some time
before she could remove it meanwhile
john was sipping his coffee and worry-
ing about whether he would get to work
on time finally mrs conkling got the
top oft the jar and the preserves were
minty

  what is this cried mrs conkling as
what she thought were plum pits rattled
on the platter

  mby the great horn spoon and the wish-
ers of the sacred cow its gold yelled
john

it was gold there were fives tens and

twenties loads of them in fact the jar
contained nine hundred and eighty dol-
lars in gold coin

three-hundred-pound preacher falls in

dough-mixer

  t j rogers of atlanta ga a three-
hundred-pound negro preacher on sun-
days and wednesday evenings and an ex-
pert dough-mixer at a local bakery on
week days bad a close call one morning
when he fell in the mixing machine the
machine started right in to mix the rev-
erend rogers along with the dough going
at the job with a mechanical thorough-
ness and a diabolical lack of interest for
the reverends ponderous anatomy in
fact as rogers declared later at the re-
ceiving clinic of grady hospital the
misable thing pretty nigh took him all
apart

  had it not been for the presence of
mind of another employee who stood
near by and who shut down the machin-
ery rogers probably would have been
sent to the undertaker one handle of
the mixer hit him a severe blow on the
head another one with its mechanical
rapidity knocked him on the arm and he
was mixed up badly

  he was plastered with very sticky
dough from head to foot when the ambu-
lance got him to the hospital and it was
hard to tell whether he was white or
black however extensive dry-cleaning
operations having been made on him he
was doctored and put to bed

disinterred body weigh five hundred
pounds

  a number of years ago doctor william
smith was married to miss louisa dun-
bar she lived in wheatland township
fayette county iii after their marriage
th e couple moved into effingham county
where mrs smith died some twelve years
ago with measles the body being interred
near their home doctor smith who now
is a resident of st elmo for some time
had wanted to have the body of his wife
taken up and taken there

the disinterment took place a short
time ago and was under the direction
around the world



of undertaker hazzard and his assist-
ants who went to a cemetery in wheat-
land township for the purpose the
giave being opened they found the box
completely decayed but the coffin was in
a fair state of preservation

  on getting down into the grave to lift
the casket to the top they were greatly
surprised to find that it was so heavy they
could not move it and they had to call
for more help the coffin was finally
lifted from the grave and an investigation
was immediately made to ascertain the
reason of so much weight

  on opening the coffin it was found that
the body had completely petrified-turned
to stone many who viewed it unite in
saying that its form and features were
as natural as on the day of the womans
burial but the entire body was solid rock
and without the casket weighed close to
five hundred pounds

sprightly chirp of frogs when they draw
their morning glass of water and before

andria ind transfer barn employee un-
derstands the meaning of au alarm bell

was struck by a freight engine the
horse escaped injury

  the bell at the broadway croj ut

a use for flags

  the oregon society sons of the ameri-
can revolution have placed flags where
they will do the most good they are
convinced that the very sight of a beau-
tiful american flag has power to stimu-
late patriotic emotion and they know
patriotic emotion is needed

  because of this conviction the organi-
zation has presented handsome silk flags
to be used in naturalization courts
throughout the state during final hear-
ings upon applications for citizenship
in the united states district court for
the state of oregon at portland the flag
is draped over the bench during the hear-
ing of the application and in another
court the judge arranges that the pro-
spective citizen shall stand holding the
flag in his left hand while raising the
right to take the oath of allegiance to the
united states

  this cult of the flag in oregon had its
noblest expression at the public naturali-
zation reception arranged by the bureau
of naturalization and the public schools
of oregon as a part of a recent educa-
tional conference in portland the city
auditorium was needed to accommodate
the more than four thousand people pres-
ent the scene was a most inspiring one
brilliant flags and eminent men and
women conspired together to make it so

  on either side of the stage an enormous
american flag was suspended just below
these on their standards were two of
the beautiful silk flags presented by the
sons of the revolution the galleries
were draped with flags and on a table on
the stage were the smaller flags to be
presented to those who that day were to
win citizenship on the stage were those
who had been admitted to citizenship dur-
ing the past year with their wives and
children an assemblage of over four hun-
dred on one side just under the great
flag where the arrangements duplicated
the scene of a courtroom was the group
of five men and one woman who were to
be publicly examined in citizenship re-
quirements accompanied by their wit-
nesses
xo

around the world

  at the conclusion of the naturalization
court which was presided over by judge
john f kavanaugh with chief naturali-
zation examiner john speed smith repre-
senting the government who addressed
the new citizens three little girls dressed
in white one wearing a red sash the sec-
ond a white and the third a blue sash
presented the flags donated by the sons
of the american revolution to the new
citizens then under the flags the whole
assembly arose and sang together with
great enthusiasm america and the
star-spangled banner

horses tail yanked off by auto

  john hamlins roan mares tail was
jerked out by the roots his buggy
wrecked and he and his sweetheart se-
verely hurt in a very peculiar accident in
forney texas it all happened when
the mares tail got mixed up with the
windshield of a passing automobile

  john had just started out for a drive
with his sweetheart they were moping
along the road talking of things which
were going to happen in the future the
roan mare had been accustomed to these
drives and was taking things easy in
fact she was taking it so easy that she
did not notice another young man and his
sweetheart coming in an automobile but
they were coming and coming at a pretty
good clip

just as the car was flitting by the roan

mare made a move with her tail to fleck
a fly from her side the tail struck in
the rods of the autos windshield-and
stuck the mares tail was yanked off
at the hips and the animal was jerked
over into the buggy and laps of hamlin
and his sweetheart the buggy was
wrecked and man and girl went down
with it the mare soon found her bear-
ing even with the loss of her tail she
rolled off the bruised lovers and they
finally got to their feet and staggered to
the roadside where they sat down to wait
for assistance

  the car went its way with the roans
tail flying in the breeze hamlin does not
know the occupants of the car he found
the mares tail a mile down the road he
declares he will now purchase an auto
and take his rides in that in the future

carpet in house is field of corn

  last fall solon mutsey of butler n
y purchased a bushel of popcorn in the
ear took it home and spread it out upon
a carpet in a vacant room on the second
floor of his house to dry one night re-
cently mrs mutsey told her husband she
had popped the last of the popcorn she
had in the pantry and if he wanted any
more he would have to go upstairs and
shell some

  mr mutsey went to the upper room for
the first time since he placed the corn
in it last fall when he opened the door
he was surprised to see numerous stalks
of corn some two feet high standing
around the room upon investigating the
strange phenomenon he found that the
roots of the corn had sprouted and grown
through the carpet

  according to mr mutsey the carpet has
been on the floor for over ten years and
has never been taken up and cleaned
he expresses the opinion that mice
gnawed the kernels of corn from the cobs
and scattered them around the room
the roof of his house leaks he says and
he believes water has dropped on the
carpet during rain storms he expresses
the opinion that the furnace pipe running
through the room kept it hot and the
moisture in the carpet started the corn
sprouting with the above result
