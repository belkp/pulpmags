whos who in  w s a

vijith one exception this issue of wonder story annual is noticeably
 a gallery of great names in science fiction this was done deliberately but
not for the glitter of great names in themselves rather for ihe logical reason
that these are great names because they wrote great stories

  jack williamson-one of the earliest artisans in the field is still hard
at work he has kept pace with the new maturity of science ficti and it is
gratifying to see that his name is as familiar to new readers as to those of a
generation ago

  iienry kuttner is the writer most other writers mention with respect he
has probably taught more of them how to write than he himself realizes a
brilliant word artist kuttner is a master of moods able to write fantasy as
brilliant as a polished diamond rowdy humor penetrating psychological studies
coldly cerebral tales at will the story chosen for this issue is mood with over-
tones of chill and often mentioned as one of his finest stories

  everyone knows rorert a heinlein for his detailed three dimensional
studies of men and machines and the industrial empires which spring from
them we have brought you a little known heinlcin which is warm human
alive with laughter and amazingly shrewd in its insight we have read a lot of
heinlein we are inclined to think this is his best story in lengths under novel
size

  most people know isaac asimov as a serious and sober writer a student
of men and civilizations youll find an unexpected side of him here-a droll
and delightful side this asimov has recently been resurrected and his new
work has begun again to reflect the wonderful humor so abundantly promised
in the earlier story included here

  the ray rradrury story is another neglected work which we have always
considered one of his best short stories that anthologists have overlooked
it is their loss and in this case your good fortune it catches bradbury at
the very peak of his prowess when the unique quality of his word pictures
made entranced readers fling the word genius about most recklessly

  and not least is frederic brown a stylist so expert that other writers
and editors are ungrudging in their admiration the story selected here is one
of a group written for the thrilling magazines several years ago which were
likely a bit ahead of their time for they are as modern and up-to-date now
in spite of the changes in science fiction as ever

  a lot of careful planning went into these choices the stories are stories with
content but in spite of that are chosen for you to enjoy if you do that well
be happy

                                           -samuel mines editor

a novel by jack willuhsojv

barry shane had to impersonate his own
enemy when earth was split
into two worlds by a barrier of hate

wall around america

barry shane first saw the ring on the
summer before he was nine it was like a
gigantic glass bowl turned upside-down over
america

barry had come alone on the monorail to visit
his grandfather it was a thrilling thing to have

copyright il by better publications inc and originally
published in startling stories july 



wonder story annual

his own compartment in the big
teardrop that skimmed so fast and
silently along the high thin rail

  grandfather barry lived in a lit-
tle blue plastoid cottage on the shore
of california corporation not a mile
from where the ring cut in from the
sea he was a lean spry cheerful
man with a bright ring guard med-
al on his breast

  can i go to the ring barry
demanded at once

  the invisible wall had fascinated
the youngster from his first glimpse
of it at the monorail station inside
it his grandfathers spotted cow was
grazing in the green meadow the
sea below the cliffs was alive with
dancing waves but on the other
side of the wall the hills were brown
and dead outside there was no sea

  better keep inside the fence
warned the old man in a cracked
kindly voice there are things out-
side a little boy shouldnt see be-
sides youll get in trouble with the
guard

  why grampa barry wanted
to know

  the guard has to protect the
ring the lean old guardsman ex-
plained if anything happened to
it you see all our air might explode
into the vacuum outside that would
kill everybody in america once a
man named brock was experiment-
ing with a machine to cut a door in
the vibration wall something went
wrong the hole must have been
larger than he intended because the
air started rushing out in a terrible
wind dr brock along with several
hundred other people was swept
outside to die

  oh mother told me cried bar-
ry you stopped brocks machine
thats how you got your medal

  the old guardsman smiled and
nodded	

  i managed to crash my patrol
plane into the machine that stopped
the interfering radiation and the
hole in the ring closed itself he

sighed that was fifty years ago
barrys face glowed with eager de-
termination

  when i grow up he declared
im going to be a guardsman
your father will have something
to say about that grandfather
barrys eyes looked sad hell want
you to be a director of chicago cor-
poration and president of urana-
tomic central like himself id want
to see you become a guard barry
maybe your mother would but pat-
terson shane will never let you give
up his millions for anything so fool-
ish as the guard

  barry puzzled over that state-
ment it didnt make sense to his
young mind

  can anybody go outside he
asked ever

  brock wasnt the first to try or
the last theyve all been killed the
disasters they caused killed several
thousand others but they seem to
keep trying in spite of the guard
perhaps some day a safe way out
will be found a way that will cause
no harm

  i want to go outside barry
stated ill find a way

  next day playing with his kite he
went toward the strange wall for
the forbidden mystery of it drew
him like a magnet fifty yards with-
in that great invisible curve the
fields stopped on a tall wire fence
hung signs that read

keep out
order of the ring guard

beyond the fence was a dusty
road still within the ring wait-
ing on the hill he watched a silent
electric patrol car come to the end of
the road above the cliffs and turn
back when it was out of sight he
slipped under the fence and ran
across the road

  beyond the road was a strip of
weeds the weeds were ended by the
ring he crouched in them close to
the barrier staring at it
gateway to paradise



  the ring was clearer than glass
absolutely invisible there wasnt
even a speck of dust on it it felt
harder and more slippery than any
glass and neither hot nor cold it
turned the point of his pocket-knife
though he could see that it had no
thickness

  horrible things lay close outside
they were brown and dry and dead
sprawled on the bleached dead grass
packs and bundles lay beside them-
cooking things and tattered blan-
kets he recognized the skeletons of
men and women babies and don-
keys one brown mummied hand
clutched a torn newspaper

  with his face pressed against that
hard invisible wall barry tried to
spell out a headline la stella negra
it must be spanish these people
must have come up out of mexico to
seek the rings shelter only they
had been too late

  suddenly he felt ill he looked
away toward the pacific inside the
ring blue water glinted in the sun
far away he could see the white
tiny sails of fishing boats but out-
side beyond the cliffs and the sea-
worn beach were only a strange
and terrible desert dark treeless
hills and tawny plains of baked
dark-fissured sea mud

  the sky was queerly black out-
side because there was no air to
make a proper sky every shadow
was harsh and cold and solid the
dead lands slanted down and down
forever into the dry mysterious
chasm where the vanished ocean
once had flowed

  what was at the bottom of that
forbidden pit one day barry
shane promised himself he would
find out

  it startled him to discover his
grandfather standing beyond the
fence behind him grinning sheep-
ishly he got up out of the weeds and
went back across the road he looked
anxiously into the old mans face

  are you angry with me gram-

pa he asked

  the seamed face looked almost
stern

  you didnt mean any harm but
the guard has to keeppeople away
from the ring the life of america
depends on it the old guardsman
smiled suddenly i was a boy once
so i know how you feel but you bet-
ter get back on this side of the fence
before a patrol comes along

  barry slipped under the fence and
gratefully took the thin gnarled
hand

  tell me grampa what was it
like really-i mean before there
was a ring and what happened
then mother and my teachers told
me a little but i never saw the ring
its hard to think how things could
be so different

  as they stood there on the green
hill looking through the wonderful
transparent wall that was their only
shelter from the changeless death
that held everything outside the
veteran told him the rings amazing
story

  it happened nearly two-hundred
years ago back in nineteen forty-
four before that there was air
everywhere the seas were filled
with water and men could live on all
the continents even america was
different then there was more wind
and the tides rose many feet instead
of inches sometimes there were
great storms and in the winter cold
waves came down from the polar re-
gions but there was more rain and
the population was twice our sixty-
eight millions

  victor barry had invented the
new science of ultra-electronics in
nineteen forty-two he built his ul-
tradyne-drive space ship vic barry
was my great-great-great-grand-
father the wrinkled face beamed
proudly and you were named for
him

  mother told me that agreed
barry shane

  automatically the old guards-


wonder story annual

mans gnarled hands began to fill his
battered pipe

  with the astronomer tyne vic
barry reached the moon-

in a puzzled voice the boy in-
terrupted 

  tell me about the moon

  thats another thing the earth
lost along with her atmosphere and
her seas the old man said the
moon was another smaller world it
used to circle around the earth a
quarter of a million miles away bar-
ry and tyne found that it was most-
ly ice-which the cosmic ice theory
had already suggested-around just
a core of rock they set up a tele-
scope on the moon the seeing was
better there because it had no air
oon tyne discovered the dwarf-
what was the dwarf grampa 
it was a small heavy dark
world a dead sun of the degenerate
matter called neutronium it was
smaller than the moon but heavier
than jupiter the two men got safe-
ly back with their warning tyne
predicted that the dwarf would miss
the earth it wouldnt even change
the earths orbit greatly but its ter-
rific tidal pull would peel off the
earths atmosphere and its seas as
tyne put it like the skin of an
orange

  barry shane peered breathlessly
down into that stark bare abyss
which once the seas had filled it was
difficult to think of america without
the ring of a world with no out-
side waiting anxiously for the old
man to light the pipe he made no
sound

  vic barry found a way to protect
america the veteran went on he
invented a new kind of ultradyne
tube that created a static wall of ul-
tra-electronic vibration a globe-
shaped warp in space is the thing we
call the ring

  those words sounded bewilder-
ing and difficult the boy looked

with worried eyes toward the invis-
ible line that divided the peaceful
life of the meadows and the sea from
the brown dead outside the words
were hard to understand but the
ring itself was real enough

  its transparent to light and
gravity and radio waves the old
man went on but its stronger than
anything material like pressure-be-
cause the space warp the engineers
say just turns pressure back
against itself vic barry designed an
ultradyne tube big enough to protect
all america he installed it in the
ring cylinder in what is now mid-
west corporation it was completed
just a few weeks before the dwarf
came

  of course the gravitation of the
dwarf reached through the ring
there were tidal waves inside and
terrible storms and quakes but it
stopped the great wave which swept
the rest of the earth and it kept our
air from escaping most of the coast-
al cities were destroyed but america
lived on

  barry shane looked back toward
the brown dead things outside that
were now mercifully screened by the
strip of weeds he tried not to shud-
der

  what about the other people out-
side he whispered

  they all perished vic barry
tried to save them he built plenty
of ultradyne tubes and sent one to
every continent with engineers to
install it but a war was going on
some of the tubes were sunk by sub-
marines and some of them were dive-
bombed later finally after the ar-
mistice all the countries were too
crippled to complete the installations
in time

  of course some refugees reached
america vic barry kept the ring
open till the last moment he nod-
ded gravely at the things beyond the
weeds they came too late

  the boy turned away from the
things outside the old man took his
shane flung himself aside as the bullet broke the mirror

hand and they started back across
the meadows toward the little blue
cottage

  go on grampa barry urged

  the dwarf passed the guards-
man resumed all the earth out-
side was swept clean of seas and air
even the polar ice was broken up
and floated away the moon was
captured by the dwarf and followed
it away into space the age of the
ring began youll be studying
about it in your history books amer-
ica had suffered millions were dead

the coastal cities were ruined chi-
cago where your father lives be-
came the greatest city

  youll study about the recon-
struction how america tried to ad-
just herself to real isolation how
science struggled to find substitutes
for raw materials cut off by the
ring how the forty-eight states
were replaced with a dozen new cor-
porations planned to give all the
people the most liberty and security

  youll learn how uranatomic
central power was organized-and


wonder story annual

how your father got control of it
thirty years ago how the monorail
system was built and how the ring
guard was formed after a reckless
experimenter had made the first dis-
astrous hole in the ring

  young barry shane looked back
toward that tawny abyss of hostile
mystery where once the sea had
flowed

  one day he said im going
outside 

  grandfather barry shook his
weary head

  many men have wanted to we
need the mineral wealth outside-
metals and oil and coal uranium for
your fathers company but theres a
terrible danger

  his solemn eyes looked down at
the boy

  remember the invisible wall of
the ring is all that keeps america
from being like outside the air is
pressing out against it fifteen
pounds on every square inch here at
sea-level if that pressure ever es-
capes america will die nobody has
ever found a safe way through the
ring you cant burrow under it
the force goes down several miles

  all you can do is go through it-
only the guard has to stop you to
protect our lives of course that
isnt their whole job they also have
to watch for any danger from out-
side

  what danger demanded barry
shane

  none so far as we know the
old man said theres no evidence
that anything alive exists outside
but youve got to make routine check-
ups on anything as important as the
ring some kind of weird life might
develop and maybe attack it i know
its wild but why take chances

  barry shanes vacation was over
much too soon he went back to his
fathers big house in chicago cor-
poration back to his books and his
teachers for three years he studied
read and played but he never forgot

the mystery of the ring

  at last his father let him come
back to the little blue cottage by the
ring for andther vacation with his
grandfather he brought a spanish
dictionary planning to try to read
what he could of that ancient news-
paper outside

  once more he waited for the pa-
trol car to come and go eagerly he
slipped across the dusty road again
this time he brushed away his tracks
with his handkerchief

  he dropped in the weeds with his
face against the ring he found the
same brown desicated things that
he had found before but when he
looked for the torn newspaper the
icy touch of mystery made him
shiver

  the newspaper he remembered so
well was gone

ii

the rock that moved

was there life outside after all
something must have taken
that newspaper tense with a half-
fearful excitement barry shane ran
back to the little blue cottage grand-
father barry was sitting on the
porch smoking breathlessly the
boy told him about the paper

  the old guardsman unexcitedly
tapped out his pipe

  other changes have been seen
outside he said i used to won-
der but its the meteors they say
meteors must fall often outside
theres no air to burn them up and
no ring to turn them off the things
outside are very dry and brittle
when a meteor strikes they simply
go to dust

  maybe muttered the boy but
i didnt see any dust

  barry shane was sixteen when he
told his father that he had decided
gateway to paradise



to quit his business courses and enter
the ring guard academy patterson
shane was a big man and anger made
him florid he stamped up and down
the long formal library of the man-
sion beside lake michigan bellow-
ing

   dont be a fool son ive got your
career all mapped out youll be a di-
rector in ten years by the time im
ready to retire you can step into
control of uranatomic central one
day with what i can give you you
ought to be the biggest man in amer-
ica so you want to join the guard
he made an angry snort why i
can give you more right now than
you would earn in a lifetime in the
guard

   he paused at the table flung open
a checkbook

  i dont want money barrys
voice trembled as he tried to find the
words for the vague but powerful
necessities that moved him busi-
ness and success arent what i want
i want something real

  whats more real than a million
dollars roared patterson shane
except two millions

   barry tried to put his feelings into
words

  id like to find a safe way out-
side without making a dangerous
break in the ring he explained
that would be worth doing en-
thusiasm electrified his voice i
want adventure danger and some-
thing worth fighting for new de-
posits of uranium even for urana-
tomic central

  patterson shanes hard eyes nar-
rowed shrewdly

  uranium well at least that
makes sense whats the chance of
finding any

  in the academy il learn ultra-
electronics barry went on ill
learn what the ring really is and why
all the attempts to make a door in it
have resulted in disaster if ever a
way is found and an expedition is
sent outside it will be in charge of

the guard his eyes looked far be-
yond the cramping walls  i want to
be among the first to go outside

   if theres money in it go ahead
said patterson shane learn all you
can at the academy then ill ar-
range for uranatomic central to
finance your experiments-naturally
for a controlling interest in all the
deposits of uranium you find out-
side

  you dont understand barry
tried to keep the bitterness out of
his voice it isnt for money its
for science i want to know whats at
the bottom of those chasms where
the sea used to be i want to know
what happened to a torn newspaper
that was taken from a mummys
hand beyond the ring i want to find
out for myself if theres anything
alive outside

  go to the academy shouted
patterson shane maybe theyll
teach vou a few practical things i
cant

so barry shane went to ring
city which was only a sleepy lit-
tle town on the wheat fields of mid-
west corporation two miles from the
ancient gray bulk of the ring cylin-
der triumphantly he passed the
stiff entrance examinations at the
academy

   he spent five hard happy years in
the elm-shaded quadrangle of time-
grayed buildings almost in the
shadow of the cylinder itself he
grew up at the academy became a
straight gray-eyed six-footer

  but the great dream stayed with
him one dav he dared to mention it
to general whitehall who was com-
mander of the ring guard and also
instructor of the advanced classes in
military tactics

  do you think sir that we can
ever go outside-without danger to
the ring i mean thats what i
really want to do-explore the out-
side

  gravely the old general shook his
	wonder story annual

lean white head

  its a difficult problem shane
he said its easy enough to rupture
the ring with an ultra-electronic vi-
bration synchronized to interfere
with its static field thats why we
have to keep the guard on its toes
the effect is pretty much like punc-
turing a soap bubble with a hot nee-
dle the balance of forces is broken
the rupture tends to spread fortu-
nately the ring can repair itself
after the disrupting force is re-
moved unless the rupture has spread
too far

  that way through the ring is
comparatively simple it requires
only the fundamentals of ultra-elec-
tronics which is why so many experi-
menters have been able to break
through probably every one of them
thought he had a new method but
that process is beyond control its
like making a hole in a sheet of glass
by shooting a bullet through it its
so dangerous that the guard must
absolutely prohibit all experiments
of that sort

  perhaps sir shane suggested
we can find another way

  perhaps whitehall admitted
but men havent been able to do it
in two hundred years we used to
keep the guard laboratory busy at
the problem but lately with the
corporation control board cutting
our appropriations every year we
have our hands full just to maintain
the routine patrols

  there must be a way shane in-
sisted america needs it there are
minerals outside that we need one
of these days the guard might need
to go outside to defend the ring
the general shrugged his thin
shoulders 

weve no enemies outside
theres something outside
whitehalls keen blue eyes seemed
sympathetic and friendly so shane
told him about the newspaper that
had vanished

  maybe a meteor powdered it he

finished but i dont think so i
think something came and took it

   thats not much evidence the
old man commented our ring pa-
trols have been watching the out-
side for nearly twro hundred years
and they havent seen anything
alive

   i know that sir agreed barry
shane but still id like to know
what happened to that newspaper

at graduation shane stood
first in the little class of twenty
men since the latest economy drive
the entire ring guard numbered
only a hundred and sixty it was fif-
teen years since the last would-be
explorer had broken through the
ring in a rocket plane that had
crashed and exploded outside no
others had been killed that time and
danger to the ring had begun to
seem remote

   from the academy shane was or-
dered to key west base ten men
under captain steadman were sta-
tioned at the ancient sun-washed
town on that low coral isle they
were responsible for more than a
thousand miles of the ring which
chopped off the shallow sea with its
vast invisible curve a mile beyond
the island

   shane was assigned to the north
flight every other day in a silent
little patrol plane driven by the
monofilm storage cells that his fa-
thers uranatomic central charged
and distributed he flew fifteen hun-
dred miles over the calm atlantic
along the ring

  the plane was designed for two
men pilot and observer but the re-
duced numbers of the guard had
left only one man available for each
flight after all here over the atlan-
tic there couldnt be much danger to
the ring ambitious americans had
 usually made their suicidal attempts
to penetrate the ring from a land
base frequently somewhere in the
lonely arid hills of new mexico cor-
gateway to paradise



poration and there was no danger
from outside

  shane himself was tired of won-
dering what had happened to that
spanish newspaper

  the months went by he made a
hundred flights the sea within was
always different in its living re-
sponse to wind and sky yet it bore
no hint of peril to the ring

  the outside for all its passive
hostility never seemed to change
beyond the rings endless curve the
dead sea-bottom stretched and
sloped away there were cracked
flats of age-dried mud range on
range of rugged mountains that once
the sea had covered the outside
could hold no danger while the ring
remained unbroken

  then he saw the rock that moved

  it was his hundred-and-fourth
flight northward the morning sun
was bright on the spume-flecked sea
beneath him beyond the ring it
drove harshly out of a black sky
every pinnacle glinted with burning
light and cast a long midnight
shadow

  a black blade of shadow stabbed
toward shane across a red mud-flat
startled he looked for what had
moved he saw a rugged brown
boulder lurching queerly through a
shallow pass in a far-off wall of
black-shadowed hills

  with binoculars fast to his eyes
he forgot the danger to himself in
a moment the rock had ceased to
move it looked harmless as any
rugged sea-worn stone but he knew
that it had moved its shadow had
been a leaping blade he studied it
for a bewildered moment longer

  the plane had been designed for
two men because of the danger of
accidents it was necessary for pa-
trols to fly reasonably close to the
ring but that invisible barrier was
as deadly in collision as a concrete
wall

  abruptly shane realized that the
sky was turning black before him

without thinking he had turned the
plane in the direction in which he
was looking

  he was flying into the ring

desperately he brought back
the stick lifted the little plane
into a loop the reaction was an in-
stant too late at a glancing angle
the plane crashed into the unseen
wall the prop was shattered the
electric motors whined and stopped
the shaken machine fluttered down
toward the lonely sea

  shane wasnt aware of much pain
at first he knew that his face had
smashed against the cowling he felt
ill yet he was angry at himself for
causing a stupid accident and he was
tense with the shock of the thing he
had seen

  stinging blood blinded him he
wiped it out of his eyes and snapped
on the radio his face felt oddly
numb and the salt sweetness of blood
was hot in his mouth

  patrol eighteen calling key
west base he croaked through
swelling lips shane calling-

  go ahead patrol eighteen a
bored voice rasped

  patrol eighteen reporting a
moving object outside gasped
shane its camouflaged to look like
a boulder but it was moving when i
first saw it it was coming through
the hills in sector forty-one b
that report seemed the important
thing he caught his breath and add-
ed plane crippled i ran into the
ring im falling do you hear me
key west base patrol eighteen re-
porting a moving object-

  forget your moving object
the humming voice was cold with
disbelief a rescue plane will start
at once

  in the little mirror on the wind-
shield shane saw a queer red mask
that he knew had to be his own face
but it didnt look familiar the
cheek and temple were cut to the
bone loose skin hung over one eye


wonder story annual

something had happened to the nose
he didnt care much looks werent
so important in the guard anyhow

  the blue tossing ocean came up to
meet him too steeply but there
wasnt much he could do about it
the stick was useless

  water exploded against the pon-
toons spray drenched him began to
sting his face yet the plane didnt
sink the rudder still worked and he
managed to hold the bow into the
wind it would float longer that way
he had to keep afloat because he had
to make a report of the moving rock
he had to make the guard believe it

  the tossing waves became waves
of dark oblivion but still with his
feet on the rudders he fought them
he didnt let go he held out until the
rescue plane dropped beside him he
caught the tossed rope and knotted
it around him before he slipped into
the waves

ill

the flash in the jungle

after barry hit the water
everything became a jumble the
rope was hauling him through cold
brine there was a rock that moved
men were carrying him on a stretch-
er he was trying to tell them some-
thing about a rock that moved his
face was sticky and stiff and throb-
bing

  then he was in a plane again it
was his own patrol plane and he was
searching for a rock that moved his
face was bandaged now so he
couldnt tell anybody anything a
nurse was talking to him

  breathe she repeated endlessly
just relax and breathe deeply

  at last he slowly awoke in a clean
hospital room its wralls were creamy
plastoid through a broad window
he could see a strip of green park

then deep blue water with a white-
winged eletroplane soaring over it
even before his mother came in he
knew he was back in chicago cor-
poration

  his mother had a tired sweet face
and a wisp of gray in her dark hair
she too had always seemed hap-
pier on their vacation trips but she
had been a good wife and housekeep-
er for patterson shane

  im sorry mother barry
shanes voice sounded oddly weak
through the bandages that held his
lips has anything happened

  she didnt know what he meant
didnt know that he had seen any-
thing outside only that he had
crashed into the ring he made her
promise to send a radiogram to gen-
eral whitehall at the ring head-
quarters

  ill send it she agreed but
dont you think you might have been
mistaken she smiled at the stiff
little shake of his head dont wor-
ry ill send it her blue eyes shone
i wanted to be the one to tell you
barry youre going to be all right
then he remembered the red man-
gled face he had seen in the mirror

  dr rand did it she said the
greatest plastic surgeon they
wouldnt let me see but i guess you
were pretty bad we had to send pic-
tures to guide dr rand the nurse
let me see your face when she
changed the dressing this morning
her tired face smiled again

  it isnt quite the same she said
i guess the pictures were retouched
too much your mole is gone and the
little scar on your lip nobody else
will mind but your mother dr rand
is really wonderful

  a nurse came in and said it was
time for his mother to go

  dont forget he said send a
message to general whitehall

  next morning the nurse let him
see his face remembering that red
lacerated mask he couldnt repress a
little shudder the only scars left
gateway to paradise



were tiny white lines already van-
ishing his face looked a little differ-
ent-as his mother had said re-
touched but dr rand was wond-
derful

  the mirror was still in his hands
when a girl came in she was tall
and efficient-looking and she almost
glowed with a dark vital beauty his
heart skipped a beat as she walked
toward him

  good morning lieutenant

  her voice was crisp and throaty
he liked her voice the creamy glow
of her skin dark eyes and the luster
of her close-shingled hair he
couldnt guess what she wanted sud-
denly the mirror embarrassed him
and he tried to slip it under the
sheets

  oh intelligence flashed in her
eyes you dont remember im
rand she ignored his astonished
gasp will you turn your face to the
light please

  her cool fingers touched the scars
so lightly that they caused no pain
at all his nostrils caught the faint
pleasant scent of her hair he want-
ed to hear her cool crisp voice again
longed to see what a smile would do
to her alert business-like face

thank you for all youve done
his stiff face tried to grin and he
felt a twinge of pain if i had
known that doctors were like you-
she didnt smile

  dont move your face she said
briskly wait until the local wears
off youre doing nicely lieutenant
youll be out in a week

  as she turned to go a panic struck
him he wanted to do something to
make her stay but he couldnt think
of anything she must be busy and
he was just another case

   by lieutenant see you again
he stared at the creamy plastoid
wall if he had followed his fathers
road there might have been a
chance but there was no possibility
that a famous surgeon would give up
her career for a cottage at a ring

guard base

  he shut his eyes to shut her out
there she stood again vital and
alert with the little half-frown of
concentration on her forehead

  barry wondered if she ever took
time to smile

next afternoon general white-
hall called the commander of
the ring guard was slender and pre-
cise and erect his abundant hair
was white but he carried his seventy
years easily in a thin kindly face
his blue eyes were shrewdly intelli-
gent

  well lieutenant his voice al-
ways seemed surprisingly deliber-
ately gruff i received a message
from your mother and i thought i
had better see you whats the trou-
ble

  my report sir shane was a lit-
tle breathless with anxiety i want-
ed to be sure my report got
through

  general whitehall looked puzzled
what report

  the reason i happened to smash
into the ring shane said urgently
i saw something move outside it
was coming up through the hills in
sector forty-one b disguised to look
like a boulder it stopped an instant
afterward

  a smile softened the generals thin
gray face

  maybe it was a boulder he said
i know youre certain but men in
the guard have imagined things be-
fore the outside is strange mys-
terious hostile it is easy to let it get
on your nerves

  but shane insisted it did
move sir

  the general smiled tolerantly

  if it will help your peace of mind
shane i have ordered the north pa-
trol from key west doubled he
took an envelope out of his blue uni-
form and here are photographs
made this morning of the hills in
sector -b


wonder story annual

  eagerly shane scanned the prints
there were the sharp-lit black-
shadowed hills there was the wind-
ing pass but the stone that had
moved was gone in a low voice he
told general whitehall that

  now youve got to believe me
sir he protested

  it is the duty of the guard to
watch for any possible danger to the
ring from within america or from
the outside in view of your report
this sector will be watched with the
utmost attention

  but still sir barry challenged
you dont believe me

  the general shook his head ive
served fifty years in the guard he
said almost forgetting to be gruff
in that time there have been sev-
eral similar reports yet no actual
threat to the ring has ever material-
ized-from outside personally i
think you are letting your imagina-
tion play tricks on you

  he moved to go

  that doesnt mean your report
will be ignored he explained but
 am going to advise captain stead-
man that you be relieved of active
flight duty for three months key
west is a good place to rest per-
haps that is what you need

  tears of angry humiliation stung
shanes eyes he blinked hard

  yes sir he gulped thank you
sir

two weeks later shane was back
at key west captain steadman
assured him that nothing unusual
had been reported since his accident
from sector -b or anywhere else
the men made good-natured jokes
about seeing rocks and other inani-
mate things that moved

  shane rented a little boat and
learned to sail he had been relieved
of duty and there was nothing else to
do he began to wonder whether the
general wasnt right if it hadnt
been his nerves sun and salt air and
the pleasant occupation of sailing

might help them relax

  but he couldnt help returning to
the ring it was strange to sail along
the brink of that abrupt wet preci-
pice looking down upon the dry coral
and the dead brown weed and the
white gleaming sand his searching
gaze could rove far across that
parched harshly-lit waste even to
the bare hills that had once been
cuba nowhere was there anything
that moved

  but he did find the moving boulder
-inside the ring

  he had sailed along the barrier
for thirty miles tacking back
toward the low green blots of the
mangrove keys he crossed a coral
shoal the water was clear as glass
against the white coral sand he saw
a dark jagged boulder that was
crawling steadily toward the land

  barry shane could hardly breathe
his tanned body suddenly felt cold
and his hand trembled on the tiller
as the moving object tipped into
deeper water he saw it well enough
it looked like the same boulder that
he had seen lurching through the
hills in sector -b it was a dis-
guised machine

  somebody had solved the old prob-
lem somebody had found his great-
est dream had learned to go and
come at will through the ring with-
out any disastrous explosions of air

  or was it somebody cold dread
tingled up and down his spine per-
haps it was something the outside
was a gulf of forbidden mystery
the passing dwarf might have peo-
pled it with alien beings it was a fan-
tastic speculation

  he forgot it-and suddenly re-
membered the riddle of the vanished
newspaper

  here was the secret he wanted
his cold tenseness passed he felt
oddly calm

  this was the moment he had lived
for whatever it might bring he was
ready

  he let out more sail and the little
gateway to paradise



boat heeled as he tacked toward the
palm-fringed mangrove keys he es-
timated the direction in which the
crawling rock had moved and drew a
line on his chart

  when it came to land he would be
waiting

  of course he had no weapon he
grinned at the dark subtropic jungle
ahead after all he didnt know
what sort of weapon might be need-
ed the little camera slung to his belt
might be equipment enough film
anyhow couldnt be accused of imag-
ining things

  he sailed along a broad coral
beach past a straggling line of co-
conut palms and pushed the boat
into concealing mangroves the
stalking monorail towers were half
a mile away a car sighed along the
high rail a silver blur of speed but
this was jungle wilderness

  a big-kneed cypress was festooned
with blue morning-glories a lone
sea-grape spread its odd broad
leaves mosquitoes hummed and si-
lent black sand-flies settled painfully
on his skin

  out among the waxen-leafed man-
groves a rattler whined

  hidden he waited he fought mos-
quitoes as he watched and listened
the sun went down the shallow
sea changed through a thousand
shades of blue and aquamarine and
became a calm mirror for the pur-
ple night

he began to wonder if his eyes
had tricked him his impulsive
plan seemed a little foolish perhaps
general whitehall was right about
the tricks of imagination

  after all-

  a muffled humming sounded over
the black water something
splashed at last a faint phosphor-
escence outlined a dark jagged
shape that was lumbering up the
beach it was the same boulder that
he had seen in the hills outside de-
liberately it crawled across the open

stretch of coral sand and went crash-
ing into the dark tangle of the man-
groves

  the little camera trembled in
shanes hand he opened the dia-
phragm wide and snapped a half
dozen shots the film was ultrasensi-
tive perhaps it would show some-
thing he ran to where the boulder
had crossed the beach ventured to
strike a shaded match in the white
sand were the unmistakable prints
of caterpillar tracks

  he snapped the camera again and
peered toward the humming in the
jungle

  shuddery dread seized him he
fought it off caught his breath and
groped for reason

  did this disguised machine have a
crew of men had some group of
americans built it to slip through
the guard and the ring to reach the
mineral wealth of the outside or
was it operated by some alien un-
imaginable invaders another idea
struck him had human beings some-
how managed to survive beyond the
ring that seemed impossible in
two hundred years he remembered
there had been no evidence of life
outside-except that vanished news-
paper

  shane decided to follow that
crawling boulder into the jungle he
couldnt be certain that his photo-
graphs would show anything by star-
light alone if he didnt follow it the
machine might go back into the sea
before he had learned the answers to
any of those desperate questions
crouching he stepped out upon the
road the heavy caterpillar tracks had
made

  flash

  a point of painful violet winked at
him and was gone it wasnt bright
yet it hurt his eyes his body tingled
and his muscles went limp a terri-
ble hand closed with agonizing pres-
sure on his heart he couldnt
breathe the camera fell out of his
hand and he dropped flat

the outsider

a crushing weight lay on
shanes chest the beat of his
heart was agonized and slow it took
all his will to draw a tiny gasp of
breath his tingling body was numb
and useless that dull violet flash
had somehow completely paralyzed
him above the slow throb of his
pulse he heard the muffled hum of
that disguised machine the crash-
ing in the mangroves came near
again and the damp rough coral
trembled under him he knew the
machine was coming back

  his eyes were dim and aching it
was hard to move them and the focus
was blurred but he saw the dark
jagged bulk lurch into the range of
his vision it stopped and the hum-
ming ceased metal clanged hollowly
a dim tall thing emerged

  he strained his throbbing eyes
forgot the agony of his heart and the
labor of breathing the tingling over
his body was suddenly a deep chill
his fancy tried to paint an alien
monstrosity then his heart went
on and he breathed again for a low
humn voice had spoken

  hullo

  that was all a tiny light dazzled
shane he could neither close his
eyes nor turn them awav he felt
hands going through his pockets and
heard a familiar click as the stran-
ger opened his camera but there was
nothing he could do

  strong hands lifted his lax body
and he was completely powerless to
resist lie couldnt even keep his head
from being bumped painfully against
the top of the low doorway he was
carried into the machine and
dropped unceremoniously upon a
hard narrow bunk

  the air had a faint sharp chem-

ical smell there was a clang as the
door closed the shoes of his captor
grated on a metal floor there were
no voices and he guessed that the
man was alone

  glaring blue lights came pn but
shane from where he had been
dumped couldnt see his captor a
bare metal wall and a tangle of
tubes and cables above him were all
he saw lie tried to speak but his
paralyzed vocal chords made no
sounds breathing took all his ef-
forts

  lieutenant barry shane that
staitled him until he realized that
the man must be reading from the
identification card in his wallet
division eleven ring guard key
west base

  the hard voice puzzled him the
accent was queer too careful sud-
denly he thought he understood
froze to a cold touch of horror that
accent he was certain wasnt amer-
ican his captor was an outsider

  lieutenant the voice told him
you will do

  but shane scarcely heard his
brain spun as he tried to think the
impossible was true somehow-
somewhere-men had survived out-
side what would they be like after
two centuries did this mean a
friendly visit or armed invasion 

  the footsteps moved way motors
hummed and the machine lurched
into motion a radio blared abruptly
modulated picked up a newscast
laboring to breathe shane thought
of all that an unsuspected enemy
could learn about american affairs
defenses and the language by listen-
ing to the radio

  water slapped against the hull
the radio went silent shane knew
that the machine had crawled back
under the sea

  he tried to fight the paralysis that
numbed him desperate necessity
spurred him he had to find out who
the outsiders were and what they
planned he had to escape with his
gateway to paradise



warning he struggled for control of
his body and slowly the paralysis
ebbed

first he was able to wink his
smarting eyes then he could
move his lips and finally manage to
shift his cramped arms the pain
left his heart and it was easier to
breathe at last he ventured to move
his head

  he could see a little more of the
machines interior the machine was
all metal there was no wood no
plastic the bolts and screws all had
curious triangular heads evidently
the builders of this machine had
been out of touch with america for
a long time he thought

  then he saw pasted on the metal
wall a bathing-girl cover from a
popular magazine published in chi-
cago corporation he could see the
date-three years ago perhaps this
wasnt his captors first trip into
the ring 

  still he couldnt see the outsider
desperately shanes eyes searched
for some possible weapon he found
a thick brass cylinder clipped to the
wall above him that looked like a fire
extinguisher perhaps that would
serve but the paralysis still gripped
his hands and his feet it seemed that
only the depper nerves which had
not completely ceased to function
were recovering he couldnt even
close his fingers yet the attack
would have to wait

  despair seized him when the hum-
ming motors stopped there was
only the whir of a fan and a slow
hissing perhaps from oxygen valves
hastily shane rolled his head back
where it had been and deliberately
lay still

  shoes rang on the metal floor
strong hands rolled him over on the
bunk his eyes blinked against the
unshaded blue light for the first
time he saw his captor he lay there
staring there was nothing else that
he could do

  the outsider was about shanes
own height he wore tight trousers
and a close-belted tunic of some un-
familiar lustrous gray material his
bearing was erect and military he
had coppery hair and a stiff reddish
little toothbrush mustache his
tanned face was rather handsome
shane couldnt help thinking that he
would look well in the blue of the
ring guard

  youre coming out of it the man
said his voice so crisp and rapid that
shane almost forgot the accent its
staccato tempo reminded him a little
of a certain radio announcer i be-
lieve that youre precisely the sort of
man i came for but i want to talk
to you lieutenant

  he lifted shanes head almost
gently and thrust a pillow under it
can you speak

  shane opened his mouth in a pre-
tense of feeble effort he drew an-
other gasping breath and tried to
make his face convey a mute appre-
hension

  dont be alarmed the tall man
said some of your motor nerves
are paralyzed but the ray didnt
reach your heart or anything vital
the short-circuiting is temporary
due to a reversible change in the
myelin nerve-sheath youll be bet-
ter soon

  he moved shanes arm to a less
cramping position

  comfortable let me introduce
myself im captain glenn clayton
as soon as you are able to speak i
am going to be forced to ask you for
certain information if you supply it
you will be treated with the dignity
that a fellow-soldier deserves
captain clayton didnt say what
would happen if the information
were not supplied his efficient and
aggressive manner suggested that he
was confident it would be supplied
sooner or later it occurred to shane
that that paralyzing light would be
an effective instrument of torture
even though it left no mark

tyhat he wondered was clayton
captain of probably he him-
self was more anxious to obtain in-
formation than the other man but
his hands and feet were still useless
and captain clayton looked hard
ruthless and alert

  soon youll be able to talk clay-
ton said ill tell you now what i
want to know-everything about
america particularly i want to
know about the barrier-the ring
you call it the location and defenses
of the ring cylinder and the num-
bers disposition and equipment of
the ring guard your capture was
very fortunate for my purpose lieu-
tenant

  he moved out of shanes sight
came back with two pairs of bright
jingling handcuffs and a big queer-
looking gun

  i must ask you to submit to
these he said youll soon be re-
covering and repeated use of the
paralysis beam would be permanent-
ly injurious to your nerves then
well be free to talk without inter-
ruption about your ring and the
guard

  he bent and caught shanes shoul-
der shanes hands were numb and
dead he couldnt even clench them
into effective fists his feet were life-
less too and this lean fighting man
was too grimly watchful to give him
any real chance the thick bright
tube shane guessed was the paraly-
sis gun

  but claytons words somehow sent
his mind back to the ring guard
academy he thought of the old gym-
nasium with its faint peculiar smell
of stale sweat and disinfectant and
the hard mats on the plastoid floor
the physical combat directors dry
precise voice seemed to be rasping
again

  now we shall take up the case of
attack against an armed opponent
when both hands and feet are fet-
tered or otherwise incapacitated
like all combat it is a question of the

intelligent use of the weapons avail-
able in this case those weapons are
weight the massive muscles of the
back and legs the grasping power of
the teeth-

  barry shane forgot this strange
machine the hard bunk under him
became a sweat-stale mat and cap-
tain glenn clayton was only another
guard cadet he twisted off the bunk
his butting head struck aside the
weapon his teeth caught a firm hold
of the flesh and skin above claytons
wrist his feet were useless so he
had to come down on his knees but
even that put him under his oppo-
nent his head went down and he
heaved

  clayton tried to fight his left fist
with the jingling manacles in it
struck painfully against the side of
shanes head but pain didnt mat-
ter now anyhow his skin was still
too dead to feel sharply

  in fractions of a second it was end-
ed clayton went over his head and
struck the metal wall behind the
bunk he dropped upon it rolled off
on the floor and lay there

  the rest of it was more difficult
than that using his elbows and his
knees shane scraped the manacles
out from under clayton with his
teeth he pushed the open jaws over
claytons wrists and closed them
with the pressure of his knees with
the second pair he secured claytons
ankle to the rail of the bunk

  by the time that was done shane
was able to stand on his tingling feet
a little life had come back into his
hands he picked up the weapon
clayton had dropped and tried it on
the wall a thin blade of dull violet
stabbed out when he pressed the
thumb-key he knew that this was
the paralysis gun

  with stiff numb fingers he
searched claytons pockets he
found a ring of keys a metal-han-
dled knife and a thin platinum case
that evidently took the place of a
wallet nothing about clayton was
gateway to paradise	

made of leather his shoes and his
belt were of a gray pliant synthetic
his only adornment was a heavy
platinum ring clayton remained
unconscious breathing heavily

  shanes numbed fingers managed
to open the platinum case a fabric
pocket contained a dozen platinum
coins shane read the inscription on
one

 new britain -  - ten
pounds on the reverse beside a
crouching lion always england

  shane whistled softly and stared
down at the tall officer this was
astounding these precisely milled
coins together with the machine
and clayton himself meant that a
strong culture existed outside if
new britain whatever and wher-
ever it was had been strong enough
to survive outside it was strong
enough to be a possible menace to
the ring and to america claytons
visit didnt exactly have the manner
of a peaceful expedition

under the pocket shane found
a picture he almost whistled
again he forgot his prisoner star-
ing at the picture it was enameled
in color or the inside top of the
case it showed a girl with violet
eyes and red-brown hair the red
lips were smiling but the eyes
seemed oddly grave

  shanes eyes still ached a little
from the paralysis ray he strained
them to see until the picture al-
most came alive it was exquisite
artistry the incredible beauty of
the girl created a new pain in his
heart he read the inscription be-
low

to glenn
from atlantis

  was that her name or her dwell-
ing or just a lovers reference that
only he and she would understand

  shane took another sober look at
captain clayton even while he lay
unconscious and shackled the tall

outside officer looked handsome

dashing and formidable

  barry shanes next and most
alarming discovery came through
sheer accident his fingers were still
numb from the paralysis ray as
he turned the metal case around
examining it closely it slipped from
his uncertain grasp and fell his
clumsy effort to catch it only sent
it clattering against the metal wall

  when he picked it up he found
that the picture of the disturbingly
lovely girl had slipped out of its
place surprisingly it was on a sep-
arate platinum rectangle beneath
it a narrow secret compartment was
revealed several folded sheets of
dark tough metal foil had been hid-
den there

  eagerly shane unfolded them
they were covered with writing in
white ink another on a thin sheet
of gray metal read

the bearer captain glenn clayton

acts with full authority for the black

   star our enemies must be destroyed

   beneath like a signature or a seal
appeared a star-shaped symbol glis-
tening black it seemed to be within
the gray metal rather than merely
stamped upon it it was a complex
pattern full of tiny lines and deli-
cate shadings he wondered briefly
how it had been made

  shane read the words twice with
narrowed eyes alarmed questions
spun in his brain what was the
black star had the people outside
planned some insane attack against
america that was what those
words ominously suggested

  he returned the scraps of foil to
their shallow cavity and snapped the
picture back into place question-
ingly he stared at the gravely smil-
ing girl she was too beautiful to
have any part in such a plot

  claytons easy voice abruptly star-
tled him

  well lieutenant congratula-
tions

the letter from atlantis

shane stepped back watchfully
holding the paralysis gun level
i mean that shane clayton spoke
from his awkward position on the
floor his manacled hands came up
as he tenderly fingered the back of
his head i dont know how you did
it you hit me like a meteor tie
grinned i thought you americans
would be fat and soft from the easy
living in the ring

  shane gestured alertly with the
gun sit up on the bunk he or-
dered youll be more comfortable
now its my turn to ask for a little
information

  clayton sat on the bunk and let
his fettered ankle swing his
shrewd greenish eyes studied shane
yet they held no alarm shane felt
that he still had a self-confident and
formidable opponent clayton
laughed an easy ringing laugh

  i see that i had better explain
he said smoothly really i let cau-
tion get the better of me i must
have seemed unfriendly i want you
to understand shane that my pur-
poses in coming through the ring
are altogether frank and open i had
no plans for anything except the
mutual benefit of america and my
people

 shanes eyes narrowed that
didnt quite fit the message signed
with the black star he kept the
paralysis gun ready

  yes he said grimly i guess
you had better explain

  i see youve examined my pocket
cases claytons greenish eyes were
alert you must have gathered
some ideas what do you want to
know 

  shane closed the case hoping that
clayton didnt suspect he had found

the hidden compartment he sat
down on a little metal stool well be-
yond claytons possible reach the
air-machine hummed and hissed be-
hind him but it was more important
just now to question clayton than
to explore his amazing amphibian
vehicle

  tell me about new britain

  clavtons hard lean face went
blank

  oh the coins his green eyes
flashed with understanding the
history of new britain begins two
hundred years ago when america
set up the ring to protect herself
and left the rest of the world to per-
ish-

  thats not true objected shane
ring tubes were supplied to every
continent its no fault of america
that they were all destroyed our
own ring was kept open until the
last possible minute

  thats your version of history
said clayton i thought you wanted
mine

  sorry go on

  a fierce pride illuminated clay-
tons ruthless face

  old britain couldnt save the
seas that she had always ruled but
her people were used to fighting for
their lives they had survived bomb-
ing raids and invasion attempts
when the dwarf came with its
greater danger they fought with
the same determination to survive

shane sensed his pride felt a
sudden liking and admiration
for this confident man and the reso-
lute race of outsiders

  german bombers wrecked the
barrier tube clayton went on
peace came too late for repairs as
the dwarf approached people took
refuge in mines deep bomb shelters
and submarines my own ancestors
were swept out to sea in a rowboat
the dwarfs gravitation lowered the
pressure of the waters churning
huge monsters up from the depths
gateway to paradise



they clawed blindly at the rowboat
almost capsizing it but guns
werent necessary against the beasts
they exploded right after reaching
the air my ancestors had to chop
the dead monsters away from the
boats or be overturned

  only a few britons survived of
course my ancestors managed to
reach what remained of the land
and slipped into a shelter just before
the vast tidal wave swept over ev-
erything that hadnt been destroyed
in the war those who lived were
faced with a terrible task you can
imagine the difficulties of existing
in a world without atmosphere or
surface water

  shane nodded ive seen the out-
side

  the people were tough clayton
said proudly every danger made
them great enough to meet the next
they wrote epics of progress they
made pressure suits out of gas-
masks they built little pressure
domes searched england for the
means of survival oxygen was their
great need the stored cylinders
in the shelters soon ran low they
used chemicals to replenish the air
then electrolysis of water that
called for electric power

  all the old combustion engines
were useless of course after the
air was gone materials for electric
batteries were soon used up for a
time things were very desperate
scarcely a hundred britons were left
alive when sanders invented the
gold-film cell which absorbs and
stores the energy of sunlight with
eighty per cent efficiency

  after a few years another dis-
aster fell the underground waters
ebbed out of the old continental
plateau the wells went dry-wells
that supplied vital oxygen as well
as merely water the britons had to
follow the migrating waters they
moved southwest to the floor of the
dry atlantic it was a strange mi-
gration

  triumph rang in claytons hard
voice

  some of their vehicles were con-
verted war tanks fitted with sun-
power wings at last they reached
new britain three thousand miles
due east of here they drilled new
wells and installed new power plants
under the sub-tropic sun they op-
ened rich mines and invented new
processes they built new dover
dome they overcame a thousand
difficulties their numbers grew
now there are a dozen dome-cities

  the handcuffs jingled on claytons
wrists his hard green eyes fell to
the queer weapon that shane held
suddenly he appeared defiant

  thats the history of new brit-
ain he rapped out

  a splendid history shane ad-
mitted but why didnt your peo-
ple communicate with america long
ago we might have been able to
help

  perhaps clayton sounded skep-
tical and bitter its three thousand
miles to new britain until the ion-
blast rocket was perfected fifteen
years ago we had no means of cov-
ering such a distance america was
only a legend our first explorers
were surprised to find that the bar-
rier really existed

  what about radio demanded
shane radio waves can pass
through the ring didnt you pick
up our broadcasts

clayton grinned conditions
are different outside even for
radio communication here inside
the barrier it is the ionized layer
in the upper atmosphere that re-
flects radio waves back to the sur-
face so that they can be picked up
beyond the horizon outside therefs
no real ionosphere but there are
traces of atmospheric gases that are
sometimes ionized

  the sun causes powerful dis-
turbances that make any sort of
transmission almost impossible by


wonder story annual

day even at night communication
is usually limited to the horizon the
result is that radio isnt much more
useful outside than a signal light
would be

  i see what do you want in amer-
ica

  he thought something flickered
in claytons eyes

  i came to get help said the lean
prisoner the old disaster is re-
peating itself there is no rain of
course to replenish our wells they
are going dry again i have come to
beg for water for life itself weve
enough to offer in return our mines
and petroleum deposits are very
rich in exchange for-water we can
offer oil coal metals and charged
gold-fim cells

  shanes eyes narrowed

  america needs those things he
agreed but why did you wait so
long to ask if you discovered amer-
ica fifteen years ago why the se-
crecy he jerked claytons gun
at the magazine picture pasted on
the wall you must have been in
america before

  ive been in and out half a dozen
times in the last two years the pris-
oner confessed listening to your
radio and trying to gather a few
facts i found that picture in an
abandoned farmhouse in the canada

corporation i was the first to come
through the barrier it took some
time to perfect the polarizers that
make the passage possible the men
who discovered the barrier were
careful to keep out of sight they
found corpses outside the ring

  his voice ended on a bitter note

  oh shane stared they found
the bodies outside where the ring
cuts off the coast he caught his
breath and they carried away a
newspaper

  i believe they did clayton said
it was printed in a language that
nobody could read somebody missed
it eh  it was stupid of them to take
it

  what was the reason for all
this

  claytons malachite eyes glittered
alertly

  an obvious precaution there
was a legend that america had been
pretty ruthless in shutting the rest
of mankind out of the barrier the
mummies seemed to confirm that
you dont have too much water even
inside the barrier we had no reason
to expect generosity

  shane met the hard searching
gaze

  i believe that america will trade
you the water you need he said
or even give it to you but  wish

        the adventures of

it smelis grand

sniff a whiff -

it smells right uouyf

gateway to paradise



your approach had been less fur-
tive

  perhaps you dont believe me
clayton challenged then take a
look at the letter i brought from my
government to yours its in the safe
under the control board look in the
upper compartment

  the hiss of oxygen was louder in
the pilot room the cramped space
was crowded with unfamiliar instru-
ments shane found a heavy envel-
ope of gray metal foil in the open
locker hastily he returned to
where he could keep a watchful eye
on the wily outsider

  it isnt sealed said clayton
read it

  shane unfojded the thick sheet of
tough pliant gray metal it was
printed in white ink which against
the gray sheet was easy to read

  to the government of america
  greetings

    captain glenn clayton the bearer
  of these presents brings you our de-
  sire for peace and friendship he will
  explain in full detail the desperate
  need of our people please consider
  them with the generosity of the strong
  for the perishing

                atlantis lee secretary
                league of new britain
                level ten new dover

  shane folded the thick metal sheet
and replaced it in the stiff envelope

it was convincing-almost but the
ominous little note in the secret
compartment bearing the curiously
mottled and striated star-shaped
seal was not yet explained in addi-
tion claytons whole manner be-
trayed a veiled hostility 

  who shane asked is atlantis
lee

  the handcuffs jingled as clayton
moved abruptly

  you were just admiring her
eh the hard voice had a snap of
ill-concealed resentment as the let-
ter indicates shes secretary of new
britain

  a ruler

  scarcely a ruler clayton dis-
sented her father the previous
secretary wras the leader of a demo-
cratic union of the dome-cities but
the political picture has changed
since the barrier was discovered an
old and long suppressed political
party called the black star has
come back into power the leader of
the black star has most of the actual
power in new britain

  remembering the note shane
tried not to start

  who is that he demanded

in response to his question
clayton yawned elaborately the

wonder story annual

black star is a secret party even
though it has won power there are
still embittered factions who make
all the trouble they can the real
identity of the leader is supposed to
be unknown to anybody else

  how does a secret leader func-
tion 

  the leader has the black star
seal clayton explained the seal
is said to be made of an artificially
radioactive crystal it makes a pe-
culiarly delicate oxidation pattern
on the metal foil that is used for offi-
cial documents an impression that
cannot be counterfeit the leader of
the black star is supposed to select
his own successor and pass the seal
on to him

  so that whs the meaning of the
star-shaped imprint

  evidently shane said youre a
member of the black star

  the hidden note which gave clay-
ton full authority to act against the
enemies of the black star seemed
proof enough of that

  if so i couldnt tell you the tall
outsider said easily

  shane decided to say nothing
about the note

  another thing he changed the
subject how do you get through
the ring

  the device is called a polarizer
clayton told him there are two
units in case one goes wrong i
dont know how it works but you
pull a lever and the friendship flies
right through just as if the ring
didnt exist

  this is the friendship shane
was astonished it can fly

  sure clayton nodded casually
ion-blast rockets powered from the
gold-film cells it would be difficult
to enter the barrier without them
against the pressure of your atmos-
phere the rockets easily lift us
above it

  shane caught his breath

  a remarkable machine he com-
mented for something that looks
like an ordinary boulder

  thank you lieutenant clayton
said smoothly may i ask your
plans

  im going to turn you over to
my superior officers shane said
the letter from atlantis leewill
be properly considered no doubt
he reflected are you willing to
run the machine

  he didnt trust clayton but the
friendship was on the bottom of
the sea one glance at the compli-
cated control console made him real-
ize that he couldnt hope to operate
the machine without instruction

  that seemed the only way to get
ashore alive besides it would be a
sort of test for the truth of claytons
story if the outsider proved willing
to pilot the friendship peacefully
into the hands of the guard it
would show that he really wanted
water to save perishing cities

  sure clayton agreed and
thanks old man

  he held up the manacles to be un-
locked

  better keep them shane told
him i think you can manage

  he unlocked the ankle chain and
followed clayton into the cramped
little room he set the discharge-
tube of the paralysis gun against the
back of claytons head

  i practiced with this he warned

  claytons lean tanned hands were
swiftly busy

  i dont blame you for doing your
duty lieutenant he said i was
suspicious of you at first though not
suspicious enough his laughter
rang out lightly strangers-from
strange countries-are apt to be sus-
picious at first

vi

one against the black star

motors hummed and pumps be-
gan to throb the friendship
heaved above the surface of the sea
gateway to paradise	

metal shutters rose to uncover wide
observation ports the ion-blasts
made a thin doleful howling

  your atmosphere clayton ex-
plained its always silent outside

  are the motors good for a couple
of thousand miles shane asked

  in three hours clayton said
two outside

  it was better to take the craft di-
rectly to general whitehall shane
decided clayton was a little too clev-
er a little too dangerous to be
turned over to captain steadman at
key west he was aware of a glow-
ing admiration for the outsiders
quick skill at the machines controls
and for his iron smiling self-confi-
dence he couldnt trust clayton
yet somehow he liked the man

  with the ion-rockets howling
wierdly the friendship plunged
ahead with rapidly mounting speed
between wings of spray she bound-
ed like a rising seaplane she left
the blue tropical water and sloped
sharply upward

  behind clayton shane watched
alertly he was ready for the out-
sider to snatch another weapon from
a hidden drawer perhaps to tip the
machine into a suicidal plunge back
toward the sea or swing it away
toward the outside

  but clayton did none of those
things he followed the course that
shane gave him the friendship
climbed through the stratosphere
the howling of the rockets died and
the air grew dark as the sky out-
side

  claytons hard brown face looked
friendly settled in his big metal
seat at the controls he made casual
comments on the machines opera-
tion if clayton were honestly
peaceful barry shane thought it
ought to be possible for him to go
back with the tall adventurer on a
visit to new britain perhaps he
could go outside

  now they were so high that the
convexity of america was visible

veiled under the gray haze of at-
mosphere the familiar line of the
coast drifted back beneath them
they crossed the flattened green
mountains of the atlantic corpora-
tion clayton spread out a chart and
shane pointed out the location of the
ring guard headquarters he saw
a little red dot wrhere the ring cyl-
inder was

  that is the mathematical center
of the ring clayton commented
i suppose the ring cylinder is lo-
cated there

  deliberately the friendship slant-
ed down the gray haze of air dis-
solved straight ahead surrounded
with golden fields of unharvested
wheat shane saw the dark armored
bulk of the ring cylinder ring city
made a pattern of roads and squares
above it and the landing field at
headquarters was a dark rectangle

  theres headquarters he said
turn

  thank you shane

  claytons hard short laugh had a
mocking ring he touched the con-
trols and the howl of the rockets
became a demoniac shriek savage
acceleration hurled the friendship
into a terrific power-dive

the big metal chair was designed
to protect the pilot from such
acceleration but shane was hurled
back against the bulkhead by the un-
expected thrust his elbow struck
the metal wall and the gun snapped
out of his hand he was pinned there
by a ruthless pressure

  a square black box dropped in
front of claytons head where it lay
against the back of the seat he
peered into hooded eye-pieces with
a stunned realization shane knew
that the black box must be a bomb-
sight

  clayton was dive-bombing the
ring cylinder

  darkness hovered over barry
shane as his thudding heart labored
to pump his blood against that mer-
	wonder story annual

ciless pressure but he clung to his
consciousness with a grim and des-
perate tenacity he knew what de-
struction of the ring cylinder would
mean

  the instant that amazing invisible
wall of ultra-electronic vibration
would cease to exist the pent-up
waters about america would flow
down into the dry sea-beds even
more cataclysmic the imprisoned at-
mosphere would expand creating
the most terrific explosion the planet
had ever seen nothing living no
work of man in all america could
stand against that unimaginable
blast

  when it was all ended there
would be a few salt lakes in the old
ocean deeps there would be a breath
of thin useless atmosphere above
them perhaps the cities of the out-
side under their armored domes
would not be injured the flood
might even bring them the water
that they needed but america
would be forever dead

  the enormity of the plot to shane
was more stunning than the shock
of the steel bulkhead against his
skull how could any man with any
motive possible attempt to murder
sixty million people with a single
act

  but captain glenn clayton was an
incredible man easy and mocking
his hard voice rang back to shane

  a power-dive lieutenant is no
time to interrupt your pilot

  perhaps that was true if the
bombs shattered the ultradyne tube
in the cylinder the grimly named
friendship might survive in a mat-
ter of seconds shane might be the
only american living and a success-
ful attack on clayton would proba-
bly result in death for both of them
but america might live

  clayton was an incredible man-
to think death would matter

  for one horrible instant it seemed
to shane that there was nothing he
could do he couldnt reach clayton

against that savage pressure there
was no time for him to scramble for
the dropped weapon his groping
fingers had already closed auto-
matically on the heavy little plati-
num case that he had taken from
clayton but the back of the tall seat
protected the outsider against any-
thing thrown from behind

  with desperate shoulder-wrench-
ing force shane threw the platinum
case the same ruthless acceleration
that pinned him to the bulkhead
could be turned against clayton

  curiously deliberate the white
metal oblong flew past clayton into
the nose of the power-diving rocket
for an instant it hung poised then
that terrific thrust flung it back into
claytons face

  the shriek of the rockets in-
creased again a shocking apprehen-
sion struck shane perhaps he had
failed after all even if he had
stopped clayton from releasing his
bombs the entire machine might
plunge on to strike the cylinder like
one tremendous rocket torpedo

  blackness dropped again

  once more shane clung grimly to
awareness in a moment he knew
that the friendship was coming out
of the dive under automatic controls
clayton was slumped sideways in
the big seat one side of his face red
with blood

  the platinum boomerang had re-
turned with even more force beneath
that terrific acceleration than shane
had expected clayton was knocked
out again

  relieved of that mighty pressure
shane dragged the unconscious man
out of the chair dumped him on the
floor and took his place at the con-
trols for three hours he had
watched clayton navigate the ship
his first efforts resulted in two or
three alarming spins but he found
that the automatic pilot would al-
ways bring him back into level flight
if he merely took his hands off the
controls
gateway to paradise	

after three preliminary circles
he brought the friendship down
on the long field between the acad-
emy quadrangle and the old low
concrete buildings that housed the
ring guard headquarters he
hadnt known how to lower the land-
ing struts checked with a sudden
full burst of the broking rockets
the ship dropped like a falling
meteor

  shane was jarred considerably but
discovered that none of his bones
were broken the friendship evi-
dently was built to take it he op-
ened the air-valve in the side and
dragged clayton out into the crater
the rockets had torn in the ground

  the ship actually resembled a
fallen meteor the metal plates that
disguised it were shaped and painted
to imitate the ragged contours of a
great boulder only the open door
and projecting rocket-muzzles and
the caterpillar tracks betrayed the
illusion

  a silent electricar came across the
field from headquarters slight
spry white-haired general white-
hall got out with a little group of
officers they looked at shane in
blank astonishment

  but it isnt a meteor an aide
stammered inanely

  general whitehall was first to re-
cover

  congratulations lieutenant
his shrewd blue eyes were bright
with comprehension so there was
a stone that moved please forgive
the skepticism of your superiors
are you able to make a report at
once

  ill try sir shane fought to
keep his feet the landing must have
been more violent than he had real-
ized i believe this is the same ob-
ject i saw approaching the ring
from outside in sector forty-one-
b

  after he stubbornly completed his
report an ambulance took him and
captain clayton to the headquarters

hospital where he was treated for
cuts and bruises clayton suffering
from concussion failed to regain
complete consciousness until the fol-
lowing day

  general whitehall was still at the
friendship when shane returned to
the disguised war-machine from
outside ring guard engineers were
already arriving at his orders to
examine it

  there are a good many things
about the ship that need study sir
shane told the silver-headed com-
mander a device called a polarizer
enables it to fly through the ring
clayton said he didnt understand
it then there are the ion-blast rock-
ets and the gold-film storage cells
the engineers have orders to
photograph and study every single
part of the machine and its equip-
ment whitehall assured him but
i imagine that your prisoner him-
self will be our most valuable source
of information

  i doubt that sir shane said
captain clayton is a remarkable
man i believe he would die under
torture rather than revealone fact
that he didnt want to reveal and i
think he is clever enough so that we
cant believe anything he tells us
until it is proved

  anyhow you will question him
shane

   yes sir

next day in a pleasant little
room in the small white building
of the guard hospital barry shane
tried to question the man he had
captured the windows of unbreak-
able vitroid needed no bars so shane
had the guards wait outside

  clayton sat up in bod his brown
face smiling under the bandages
the room was quiet on the surface
it was a casual scene but claytons
hard greenish eyes betrayed a mock-
ing defiance

  congratulations shane clay-
ton said in a crisp voice how did
c	wonder story annual

you do it

when shane told him he grinned
clayton i cant understand you
shane sat down in a chair by the bed
youre brave youre intelligent
i like you-

  thanks lieutenant under the
bandages clayton grinned again i
can say the same about you

  but i cant understand you
shane repeated soberly yesterday
you attempted to murder america
to kill sixty million men women and
children - the large majority i
think of the human race left on the
planet how could you do a thing
like that why

  claytons short laugh rang hard
of course you cant understand
no american could but some of us
can outside the black star has
understood for two hundred years
i told you that some of us resented
being shut out of the ring

  i explained that you had no rea-
son to

  claytons eyes were hard as mala-
chite

  i rejected your explanation
  shanetried another angle

  what has the black star-this
secret party in new britain-got to
do with your presence in amcrica 
there are some things ill tell
you clayton said completely self-
possessed some things i wont i
refuse to answer any more questions
about the black star

  shane questioned him for two
hours the results were not satis-
factory claytons answers were
mockingly evasive

  late that night in general white-
halls office in the gray old head-
quarters building he reported his
failure worry shadowed the old gen-
erals shrewd blue eyes

  he must talk shane we dont
know the real reason for his attempt
to dive-bomb the ring cylinder we
dont know how many enemies
america has outside or when they
are planning to strike or what un-

expected weapons they may use
weve got to have that information
to save america

  shane shook his head i dont
think well get much dependable in-
formation out of clayton he hesi-
tated then blurted hurriedly but
ive been thinking sir i believe
well have to use the outsiders own
methods ive got a plan

  whitehalls shrewd eyes bright-
ened what is it

  we must send a man outside
sir

  shane thought that the keen blue
eyes were looking through his head
to the very back of his mind for a
long second whitehall studied him
a sober little twinkle came at last
into the deep-set eyes

  and you want to be the one to
go

  shane caught his breath and swal-
lowed again

  yes sir if you will just listen
to my plan its the only way i see
to get the information that america
needs his voice grew husky with
excitement i want to go outside
sir-back to new britain-in clay-
tons place

vii

double for danger

citting behind the rigidly mili-
tary order of his desk in the
room at headquarters general
whitehall frowned shook his white
head and began to make objections

  you mean you want to masquer-
ade as clayton  it would be suicide
for a dozen reasons in the first
place you dont even look like clay-
ton

  shane leaned anxiously over the
desk

  im almost exactly the same
height he urged we can send for
gateway to paradise



dr rand and have her do another
plastic operation she can rebuild
my face into a duplicate of claytons
ill study his voice and mannerisms
that might be done whitehall
admitted his keen blue eyes twin-
kled again this time with approval
but we know almost nothing about
new britain and claytons life there
and he doesnt seem inclined to sup-
ply infoimation remember the
outsiders have been isolated for two
hundred years language and cus-
toms change especially under such
sharply different conditions as must
exist outside their vocabulary
probably contains thousands of new
words it probably took clayton a
long time to master our english
but we can use his own meth-
ods shane insisted ive just been
down at the shops talking to the en-
gineers at work on the friendship
thats where the idea came to me
theyve found some more of clay-
tons metal foil notes there are
maps that show the cities of new
britain a few personal letters rolls
of foil printed in microscopic type
that seem to correspond with our
magazines and newspapers i can
acquire a fair vocabulary by study-
ing them

  pronunciation will be different
whitehall objected

  - i can use the radio shane said
after i get near enough to new
britain to pick up anything the lack
of a heaviside layer cuts down the
range of radio outside perhaps i
can pretend to be injured or ex-
hausted after i get there to gain
a little more time

  the general nodded slowly i see
youve thought this out shane may-
be you have something another
argument made him shake his head
but you would have to take the
friendship thats too valuable to
give back to the outsiders at least
until our engineers have had time to
complete their study of it

   realize that sir shanes gray

eyes lit with hope he felt he was
about to win his point i wont
need to take the friendship the
engineers have found escape equip-
ment stored in a compartment bv
the air-valve evidently it was in-
tended for clayton to use in case
anything went wrong with the
friendship itself that discovery
was the beginning of my whole plan
sir

  whitehalls keen features began
to reflect shanes eagerness

  what sort of equipment he
asked

  an air-suit shane said it
doesnt look comfortable but its fit-
ted to keep a man alive for days
outside and theres a light electric
motorcycle powered with gold-film
cells the helmet of the suit had a
two-way radio

  the victory was almost won
shane caught his breath and confi-
dently drove on

  you see i can use the radio to
get in touch with them ill report
that the friendship was destroyed-
by a weapon that is waiting for any
other outsiders that happen to come
along

general whitehall rose
abruptly thats possible he
tried to control his enthusiasm you
can report that you were captured
by the guard and set free to take
back a message well send a reply
to that letter from the secretary of
new britain offering them the
water they need by peaceful ex-
change

  then another obstacle checked the
old generals mounting enthusiasm

  but how will you get outside
he queried if you dont take the
friendship 

  i discussed that with the engi-
neers they have identified the polar-
izer units aboard the friendship and
have already learned a good deal
about them apparently they tell
me the units create an intense spe-


wonder story annual

cial field on the same ultra-electronic
level as the vibration of the ring it-
self atoms in this special field are
polarized their axes rotate into
alignment with the radial axis of
the ring

  the effect is probably quite tem-
porary but polarized matter evi-
dently passes through the ring just
as light does without making any
ruptures in it the engineers say
they can dismount one of the units
from the friendship and use it to
put me through the ring with the
air-suit and the motorcycle when-
ever im ready to go

  i see whitehall nodded but
how will you get back

  shane grinned thats a bridge
to be crossed when i get to it its
easy to get out of the ring at sea
level but not so easy to get back
against fifteen pounds of air pres-
sure there are ways though i
could make a report from outside
by radio by that time the engineers
probably will have finished their
study of th friendship and have her
ready for operation they might fly
the machine outside to pick me up

  also it will be possible to dupli-
cate the polarizers a special air-
lock could be built extending
through the ring with a polarizer
inside that would make it possible
to come and go at will but weve no
time to wait for such things now
urgently shanes voice dropped
please sir what do you think

  soberly the old general smiled
you seem to have answers for all
my arguments the matter will have
to be discussed with my staff but i
suppose well have to let you go

  thank you sir whispered
shane

  dr della rand arived next day
from chicago corporation in answer
to general whitehalls urgent call
at the monorail station in sleepy
little ring city shane was waiting
to meet her his breath came a little
faster as the huge silver teardrop

of the car paused above the station
tower the famous doctor stepped
out of the elevator and his heart
skipped a beat 

  her dark vital beauty was arrest-
ing as ever her skin had the same
warm glow her eyes the same pene-
trating quickness but something had
changed shane felt a pang of vague
loss then he knew wthat the trouble
was

  della rand hadnt changed at all
but he had seen the picture clayton
carried of that violet-eyed girl of
far-off new britain who bore the
haunting name of atlantis lee

  hello shane

  even her throaty efficient voice
hadnt changed her dark alert eyes
studied his face yet he knew she
saw only the deft work of her sur-
geons hands

  general whitehall sent for me
she stated what does he want

  shane could talk to her now he
wasnt afraid of her he didnt flush
or stammer because she didnt real-
ly matter any longer

  a military secret he said i
need another facial operation

  her dark eyes widened whats
the matter with you now 

tte told her about the plan and
the situation that made it neces-
sary her quick mind accepted and
digested the fact that men lived out-
side she studied shane again as if
she had never really seen him before
in a lower different voice she
asked

  isnt this scheme of yours very
dangerous

  nothing is too dangerous now
shane said

  they talked to general whitehall
in the headquarters office

  clayton mustnt know what
were planning explained the
slight old commander were going
to make recordings of his speech
and study his unconscious manner-
isms hes clever enough to trick us
gateway to paradise



if he knew but his face was cut
when lieutenant shane captured
him the injury hasnt been proper-
ly repaired ill arrange for you to
make an operation on him at once
that will give you an opportunity to
study his face

  also suggested the woman doc-
tor i believe we should make some
psychological tests that is another
specialty of mine i was led into it
through a study of the psychology
of facial expression

  shane was present in the hospital
operating room when clayton first
saw della rand the prisoners
greenish eyes lit with an instant ad-
miration

  you are going to complicate my
task doctor clayton grinned i
came here to make war on america
now i see that ill have to save your
life and take you back with me to
new britain

  della rand caught her breath tt
was the first time that shane had
ever seen her air of curt efficiency
disturbed he thought she was
pleased as well as flustered to a
woman he supposed clayton must
seem daring and romantic in a mo-
ment however she got back her pro-
fessional briskness

  all right she said curtly lets
see your face

  shane watched the operation the
delicate instruments of bright steel
seemed to live in her deft hands
newly developed adhesive joined the
tissue of nerve and muscle and skin
so that no -stitches were required
when she had finished only a tiny
line showed where shanes acceler-
ation-hurled missile had cut its long
slash even that would slowly van-
ish

  next morning back in his own
room at the hospital shane con-
fronted the tall outsider

  now well have to take you to a
cell in the guard prison unless you
want to give your parole and stay
here you will still be under guard

of course but you will be more com-
fortable

  sure clayton said promptly

  then you give your word not to
attempt escape

  for a split-second clayton seemed
to hesitate shane thought his green-
ish eyes flashed as if with some con-
cealed reckless amusement

  i do he said

tn the days that followed clay-
-t ton proved ready enough to talk
to shane so long as they kept off
certain topics such as the black
star he also insisted on the right to
ask as many questions as he an-
swered every moment shane could
see he was devouring every possi-
ble fact about the science geography
and defenses of america shane was
haunted with a fear that he would
escape in spite of his parole and the
guards about the little white hospi-
tal to make some new attack on the
ring cylinder

  shane explained that fear to gen-
eral whitehall the commander ad-
mitted the danger twenty men of
the now enlarged ring guard were
assigned to the duty of preventing
the outsiders escape

  claytons laugh was a mocking
challenge when shane told him that
della rand was planning some psy-
chological tests

  let her go ahead he invited
sardonically ill find out as much
as she does besides the tests should
be amusing della is really too
charming to die in america lieu-
tenant im going to take her home

  if thats a joke shane retorted
it isnt funny what about atlantis
lee

  atlantis clayton said is a
long way from the midwest cor-
poration

  shane spent many hours with the
engineers aboard the friendship
he learned to operate every mechan-
ism and studied every detail of de-
sign material and construction he
	wonder story annual

memorized every word on the metal
foil rolls and letters every line on
the maps

  shane was never sure just when
clayton perceived the plan when
the guards let him into the hospital
room on the morning that della was
to begin the operations on his face
he asked clayton for the massive
platinum ring

  id like to keep it clayton pro-
tested covering the heavy bezel of
plain white metal which didnt even
carry a monogram it has senti-
mental value

  i cant picture you as sentimen-
tal shane snapped give me the
ring

  grinning clayton slipped it off
and tossed it to him

  i was wondering whether you
would think of it he said not that
it will help you much a cold note
of warning came into his voice
youre a fool to try this shane
to get an idea of your chances just
reverse the situation suppose that
i had managed to turn up in your
place on my first visit to america

  think of all the people i would
have had to deceive-your friends
your relatives your fellow-guards-
men surely not knowing anything
at all about them i would have made
one false step and one remember
can be enough to result in the death
of a spy

  his hard challenging green eyes
mocked shane

  maybe della can give you a copy
of my face he continued but the
scars will be visible to one who
knows how to look im a quarter of
an inch taller my eyes and my voice
and my hair are different you may
forget one of my habits which
youve bden studying so carefully
and betray yourself with some little
trick of your own

  remember shane life is hard
outside its easy to keep alive in
america a naked animal can do it
but it takes a lot of skill and a lot

of equipment to keep alive outside
he gave a hard little laugh dont
you see that youre a fool

  thanks for the hints shane
grinned at him but just keep the
situation reversed suppose that you
were in my place wouldnt you take
all those risks willingly for your own
people

  claytons lean face grew visibly
warmer in that moment shane liked
and admired the tall outsider more
than he had before

  sure i would

  then the guards and nurses came
to take them to the operating room

the gentle death

della rand herself in shanks
quiet room at the hospital re-
moved his bandages her dark close-
shingled head made a curt little nod
of professional satisfaction stand-
ing behind her general whitehall
pursed his thin wrinkled lips in a
silent whistle of astonishment della
gave shane a mirror

  he gasped unable to believe what
he saw it was uncanny it made
shivery cold feet run up and down
his spine he felt just the same ex-
cept that his new facc was still stiff
and painful but the hard handsome
features that looked at him from the
mirror were those of captain glenn
clayton

  his dark hair had been bleached
and dyed to the bronze of claytons
the magic of biochemistry had
changed his skin to claytons ruddy
brown his gray eyes from the deli-
cate injection of special dyes had
taken on the greenish glint of clay-
tons

  i cant believe it

  even his voice startled him clev-
er surgery on his larynx and sinuses
gateway to paradise



had given it the quality of claytons
he looked down at his hands they
also had felt dellas knife but the
tips of his opposite thumbs and fin-
gers were set together in a charac-
teristic habit that was his own

  that  isnt clayton general
whitehall warned him dont ever
forget that one little gesture even
a tiny thing like that might destroy
you and the hopes of america

  the day he was to leave shane
couldnt resist the temptation to vis-
it claytons guarded room he was
wearing claytons tight gray trous-
ers and tunic to get used to them
with the paralysis gun at his hio it
surprised him to find della rand
there at a little table scattered with
her test equipment

  clayton seated across from della
with his palms resting on two elec-
trodes stared up at shane for a
moment he looked blank with aston-
ishment then his handsome face
broke into a smile of admiration

  splendid shane he cried-in
the voice that was now identical
with shanes own thanks for let-
ting me see his green taunting
eyes looked back at della your
gadget must have registered some-
thing then beautiful

  surprise said dellas curt voice
point-o-sixteen

  claytons bold brown face turned
back to shane

  she thinks shes learning things
from me his hard voice had a
malicious ring but i dont need a
laboratory to tell that she aready
registers about point-o-sixty degrees
of love

  dellas face glowed with color
stop it she ordered curtly or
ill call the guard

  yet shane wondered if clayton
hadnt told the truth clayton
grinned at him

  splendid shane he repeated
mockingly you look exactly like
me-to anybody who doesnt know
me there are a thousand things that

can betray an impersonator in a
world that he has never seen before
perhaps you have thought of a hun-
dred of them there are nine-hun-
dred more

  shane waved in farewell and went
out of the room that was the mo-
ment clayton had selected to break
his parole now that barry shane
looked exactly like him he also
looked exactly  ik barry shane it
would have been foolish not to make
some use of such a convenient fact
he too had been observing manner-
isms and voice inflections he had
planned a desperate masquerade of
his own

  when shane went out clayton
was left alone with della rand
that had been easy to manage for
he was on parole all the doctors
reaction tests had not revealed his
plan though he had encouraged her
to go on by yielding a few unimpor-
tant bits of information about new
britain he simply refused to co-
operate when any guards were pres-
ent

eighty seconds after shane de-
parted clayton followed della
rand was left lying across the bed
she was unconscious from an anes-
thetic needle in her own kit her
mouth and wrists were turning blue
from the pressure of claytons
hands

  clayton had flung off the bathrobe
he had worn he had torn his under-
clothing and mussed his hair della
had scratched his face injuring her
own deft handiwork but even that
helped his planned effect

  in the hall outside he met the star-
tled guard

  where is he his breathless
gasping tones were a splendid imita-
tion of shanes altered voice he
overpowered me-took my clothes
and gun he looks like me now-
wheres clayton

  the guard blinked and gulped and
automatically pointed


wonder story annual

  lieutenant shane-i thought he
was shane-just went that way

  fool that was clayton clay-
tons voice cracked like an angry
whip at the confused guard hes
getting away hes desperate spread
the alarm here give me your gun

  yes sir croaked the dazed
guard

  it was a simple plan one that had
the audacious simplicity that was
the spice of life to clayton clutch-
ing the gun he grinned as he sprint-
ed down the twisting corridor in the
direction the guard had pointed

  it was neat shane would be bur-
ied if nothing went wrong as the
outsider killed while attempting es-
cape clayton himself calmly carry-
ing out his own masquerade would
be escorted to the ring and safely
through it by the very men as-
signed to the duty of guarding him
the first intimation of the truth
would be the unexpected descent of a
black star rocket-bomber fleet on
the ring cylinder

  of course there were a good many
things that could go wrong but clay-
ton was used to risks and he enjoyed
them this attempt he thought was
no more desperate than shanes plan

  there was only one phase of the
affair that clayton regretted he
wished it had been possible to take
della rand with him he had ad-
mired her from the beginning but
he had never quite realized how
much he really wanted her until
those brief delicious seconds when
her lithe slender body struggled in
his arms before the anesthetic took
effect

  he turned a corner and saw shane
ahead of him clayton flung up the
heavy pistol he had snatched from
the bewildered guard it was a more
deadly thing than the paralysis gun
shane had taken from him the
sights crossed the back of shanes
head but the gun shivered in clay-
tons hand and he did not pull the
trigger

  shane wore his own clothing
shane was walking with his own
jaunty stride that bronze head was
his own the man ahead was him-
self

  clayton thrust away that brief
uncanny feeling he tried to forget
a sudden unwilling liking for the
quiet-voiced guardsman emotions
didnt matter now the long-planned
final victory of the black star was in
sight

  he steadied the gun but shane
had swung on down the hall and
clayton saw the long mirror at the
end of it at the same instant shane
saw the crouching image of his near-
ly naked dotible tense in the very act
of firing

  claytons bullet broke the mirror
but shane had flung himself aside
there was no time to turn and aim
yet his lightning reaction served
him before the mirror shattered he
had discharged the paralysis gun at
it toward the image of his double

  the thin beam of dull violet was
reflected back to the outsider his
gun-arm dropped suddenly numbed
the borrowed weapon clattered on
the floor

  even then disarmed clayton
clung to his story at shanes sug-
gestion the swiftly gathering guards
held them both general whitehall
arrived della rand recovered from
the anesthetic needle gave her ac-
count of the affair they were judges
that clayton could not deceive

  shane went on to undertake his
adventure outside

handcuffs were snapped on
clayton and he was escorted
back to his room della rands reac-
tion test equipment had been re-
moved the room was stripped bare
as a cell he spent the rest of the day
in the company of six guards

  next morning slight shrewd-
eyed old general whitehall came in
the room to see him his thin face
was sober his voice low with regret
gateway to paradise



  clayton he said gravely
youve broken your parole

  chains jingled cheerfully as clay-
ton sat up on the bare mattress in
the corner red and welted where
della had scratched it his hard
grinning face looked faintly sinister
so i have he agreed

  youre a riddle to me clayton
the old guardsman shook his head
wearily i like you personally yet
after what you did yesterday we
cant overlook the fact that you are a
ruthless and clever enemy

  no general claytons voice had
a bitter ring you cant understand
me but if you had lived outside-if
your forefathers had for two hun-
dred years-you could if you had
seen human beings dying for want of
the oxygen in a cup of water when
you knew there were oceans of it ly-
ing inside the barrier then you
could understand

  butprotested whitehall were
willing to give you water

  perhaps you are now to save a
little for yourselves clayton re-
torted but you failed to do it two
hundred years ago america should
congratulate herself general on
two centuries of borrowed time-of
stolen life

  whitehalls face went stern that
attitude is unfortunate he said
both for america and new britain
but it exists and must be dealt
with cold now his shrewd eyes
studied clayton captain we are
prepared to offer you two alterna-
tives

  only two claytons smooth
voice mocked

  there is still time to change your
atittude whitehall stated you
can answer our questions honestly
you can co-operate squarely with
our efforts to establish friendly rela-
tions and peaceful trade with new
britain

 euthanasia whitehall an-
swered soberly

  puzzled for a moment claytons
green eyes glinted with understand-
ing

  oh he said softly the easy
death-your polite and scientific
name for murder

  if you prefer to call it that you
attempted to destroy the ring cylin-
der yesterday you tried to kill lieu-
tenant shane frankly captain i
regret this very deeply but we feel
that you are too dangerous to amer-
ica to be allowed to live to endanger
us

  claytons face lit with a reckless
amusement

  your regrets are unnecessary i
assure you that in your place i
should take the same action with no
regrets at all you americans are
better men than i thought

  whitehall stood silent in a husky
voice hardly above a whisper he
said youre a strange man clay-
ton this is more painful to me than
you can understand our surgeon
will be ordered to prepare for the
operation at once i assure you there
will be no pain

thank you general clayton
said though that is not important
he allowed himself a wolfish grin
who he wondered would the sur-
geon be

beyond the ring

c eneral whitehall shook
 hands with barry shane before
the young guardsman started for
the ring bright with a fresh amaze-
ment his keen blue eyes studied the
face the posture and the odd gray
clothing that had been claytons
own

  you almost make me think youre
really clayton carrying out his lit-
tle plot after all his voice sudden-
ly went grave this is a mad adven-
ture shane but you cant fail its
too important

  when shane grinned it was clay-
tons own hard grin

  ill do my best he promised i
was just talking to the engineers
about our imaginary weapon they
suggest a decoherer-a beam of
force that appears to destroy the
molecular cohesion of metal so that
good steel crumbles to useless dust
actually sir is there any possibility
of such a weapon 

  wearily whitehall shook his shag-
gy head

  none im afraid the defenses of
america had been neglectedfor two
hundred years we have depended
on the ring we dont even have the
machine-tools and trained men to
create the sort of armament that
america had two hundred years
ago of course were trying desper-
ately to get ready for trouble were
enlisting men in the guard our few
arsenals are working day and night
trying to arm them

  his blue eyes were bleak with
dread

  but weve no protection at all
from bombing raids on our cities or
the ring cylinder itself from such
rocket-bombers as the friendship
thats why your mission is so vitally
important

  a special monorail car sighing
along at four miles a minute over the
high steel thread took shane to key
west two guard engineers accom-
panied him carrying one of the po-
larizer units that had been taken
from the friendship

  that night a guard amphibian
took them from the base to a low
barren coral islet that lay half in the
ring and half outside shane shook
hands with the engineers then seat-
eded himself in the clumsy bulk of
the air-suit awkward in it he
gateway to paradise



mounted the silent electric bicycle
and tried it out on the hard beach
within the ring

  swiftly the engineers set up the
compact polarizer they anchored it
with long steel spikes driven into the
coital and ran wires to the controls a
hundred feet back from the ring
one of them leaned the motorcycle
against the rings invisible wall
above the polarizer he stepped back
and called out okay joe

  something slapped the motorcycle
through the ring

  okay lieutenant said the engi-
neer your turn

clumsily shane walked across
the coral sand he pressed his ar-
mored body flat against the invisible
barrier of vibration waiting there
while the engineers fumbled with
something he had to fight a moment-
ary panic

  science had given him claytons
face and claytons voice he had tried
to learn how clayton talked how he
behaved and even how he thought
still he wasnt clayton one tiny
blunder might destroy both him and
america

  luck lieutenant

  he was glad to hear that brisk
voice because it broke his dread he
moved his hand in a silent signal
something clicked a little tube
glowed blue and the ring didnt ex-
ist air pressure like a mighty hand
flung him forward-outside

  dazedly shane got back his breath
in the heavy helmet and stumbled to
his feet he shuffled toward the dark
forms of the engineers but the ring
had come back and he collided with
its unseen wall

  the engineers moved and he
knew they were speaking yet no
sound came through for a moment
he was conscious of a painful loneli-
ness with the dials on the chest of
the suit he snapped on the radio a
blare of american music lifted his
spirits

  he resisted an impulse to call key
west base he knew from claytons
maps that the outsiders had estab-
lished outposts of some sort within
a few hundred miles of the ring it
was one of them designated on the
maps as point fourteen that he
hoped to reach possibly too patrol
rockets would be sent even closer to
the ring under cover of night for
the outsiders by now might be won-
dering why clayton hadnt returned
there was danger that any report
might be overheard

  he set up the motorcycle and
mounted it stiffly with a last wave
to the engineers he turned down the
first barren slope of the abyss that
once the sea had filled now he was
on his own

  the low coral islet became a dark
looming hill behind him and the two
men there were lost the atmosphere
under the ring made a misty blur
against the sky but the stars that
filled the black heavens of the out-
side burned with a cruel naked
splendor

  the electric vehicle ran without
sound for there was no air to carry
vibration its headlight made a tiny
defiant glow against the overwhelm-
ing dark under the synthetic rubber
tires age-dried weed crumbled to
noiseless dust empty seashells went
soundlessly to powder

  the silent wheels jolted over gro-
tesque arms of dead coral down and
down into the chasms that once the
sea had filled shane inched up the
speed and began to take chances on
the bumps

  elation mounted in him this was
the dream of his childhood he had
always dreamed of going outside to
explore the bottom of the empty
oceans and plumb all the mysteries
of his wondering youth

  his heart began to pound he
crouched lower in the saddle of the
jolting motorcycle and his thick
gloves tightened on the handlebars
he jumped a black pit in the dry sea-

floor and careened around a boulder
he piled up in the next hole

  drunkenly he struggled to his feet
he felt hot fevered suddenly he
knew what was wrong he was
breathing so much oxygen he was in-
toxicated with it

he adjusted the valves and
sanity came back to him once
more he perceived the sobering per-
ils ahead he closed the valves a little
farther a few pounds of oxygen
might be the price of life before he
reached point fourteen

  he set up the motorcycle except
for a few bent spokes in the front
wheel it seemed uninjured he
mounted again and rode on down
more slowly now into the seas emp-
ty chasm

  the air-suit with its burden of
oxygen tanks and equipment was al-
ready heavy and irksome it was in-
genious enough a tiny chemical unit
with gold-film power returned
drinking water glucose and fresh
oxygen from the moisture and car-
bon dioxide in the exhaled air the
inside pockets held equipment and
packets of concentrated food he
could slip his arms out of the heavy
sleeves to reach them

  there was even a waste-disposal
valve but no ingenuity could have
made the thing really comfortable
for so long a march as this

  presently the sun came up with
almost the violence of physical shock
frigid night became blinding day
through the transparent face-plate
the sun struck with a savage blister-
ing force despite its reflecting sil-
ver plate the suit became uncom-
fortably hot yet every ink-black
shadow among the rocks retained a
well of bitter cold

  all that glaring day he went on
with only a few brief pauses for rest
then all the following night the oxy-
gen and the gold-film cells would last
only a few weeks he had to reach
point fourteen soon

  long since the misty blur of the
ring had been lost behind him he
pushed the jolting silent vehicle
across the dry mud flats and dead
dark hills down into the vast desola-
tion of the vanished atlantic

  it was just before dawn of the sec-
ond day when the damaged front
wheel abruptly collapsed thrown
from the wrecked machine he
pitched down a rocky slope he had
to move hastily to slap an emergency
patch over a hole that a broken spoke
had torn in the thick fabric of his
suit

  shaken and breathless he fumbled
uselessly with the wreckage though
the first glance told him that repairs
were out of the question at last he
reluctantly left it and plodded on

  thereafter he lost his count of the
days he lived and struggled from
moment to moment he had a job to
do and he was trying to do it it
didnt matter greatly whether it was
day or night the sky was always
dark no matter how strange the
wastes of age-baked black-fissured
sea-mud about him or how wild the
crags of uneroded mountains he
couldnt get lost

  he knew the direction of point
fourteen always he could find it by
looking for some familiar group of
stars that was all he had to do-
just follow the stars down into the
empty sea the little headlight fas-
tened on the helmet helped to pick
out his way

  it didnt matter how his body
ached from effort or how the pres-
sure of the heavy suit chafed him
or how stale the air became or how
the numbing drunkenness of weari-
ness begged for him- to stop there
was nothing to do but go on

  he never knew how long it took
him to climb that last black volcanic
range which once the sea had
drowned rugged precipices opposed
him sharp lava tripped him and im-
peded him recklessly he opened the
valves to give himself new energy
gateway to paradise



  it was close to sunset when he
came to the summit of the range
hopefully he looked beyond the
cragged pass according to clay-
tons maps point fourteen ought to
be in sight from here on the crown
of another range sixty miles beyond

  from his feet the shadows fell
they made chasms of frigid mid-
night half afraid to look he let his
eyes range farther past the black
ragged shadow of the range lay an-
other desert plain vaster than any
he had crossed another wall of
stark hills broke it mile on mile be-
yond

  there was no gleaming dome no
moving rocket no work of man

wearily he sat down on a
rugged jut of lava once some-
time in the blur of the past he had
seen some rusted steel plates they
must have been part of a ship sunk
long before the dwarf tore the
oceans away but that was the only
hint that men had ever been outside
before him

  a dull despair began to chill him
would he ever find new britain

  he began to fumble with the radio
dials on the chest of the bulky suit
listening anxiously for any human
voice but his straining ears heard
only the hiss and crackle of static

  the sun went down like a black
tide of death freezing shadows
flowed up through the pass barry
shane shivered in the clumsy air-
suit and kept fumbling with the
radio dials slowly the roar of the
suns interference faded out around
them

  an hour later the first voice came
through

  strange in the phones it sounded
harsh and guttural and twangy at
first he thought it was a totally for-
eign language it had been repeated
three times before he could distin-
guish the familiar english words

  point fourteen calling rocket
avenger

  then the reply came in it was a
garbled blur of strident gutturals
but presently he began to catch a few
words

  patrol    barrier  no trace
   all night the last phrase was
clear captain barlow contact off

  shane listened all night to the
scraps of conversation he could pick
up whispering huskily in the big
helmet he practiced the harsh ac-
cent it was easier to learn than he
had expected part of the strange
harshness he thought was probably
due to the fact that the outsiders
lived and spoke under a pressure of
only some four pounds of a special
gas mixture that was three-quarters
oxygen instead of fifteen pounds of
the twenty per cent mixture called
air

  that was a fact that the engineers
had learned from their study of the
friendship four pounds of internal
pressure put much less strain on a
sealed ship or a dome-city than fif-
teen the helium and other inert
gases in the mixture were less likely
to cause the bends if any accident
caused a change of pressure there
was no nitrogen to form deadly bub-
bles in the blood

  but sound conduction in the syn-
thetic mixture was different

  late the third night shane called
for help though he knew his accent
still wasnt perfect all his prepara-
tions had been too hurried clayton
had spent years getting ready for his
invasion of america only to fail

  the dropping pressure in the oxy-
gen tanks cut off shanes time he
snapped on the tiny short-wave
transmitter built into the big helmet

  calling point fourteen he
panted feebly into the mike cap-
tain clayton-of the friendship-
calling point fourteen calling-

  the swift reply startled him

  clayton where are you the
harsh voice seemed surprised and
excited this is point fourteen go
on clayton


wonder story annual

  shane made his voice fainter
friendships lost he gasped
im in-suit sixty miles west of-
point fourteen please pick-me
up he let his feeble voice wander
incoherently message from amer-
ica  cant breathe   power going
but ill keep on the light 

  hang on clayton rasped the
phones well send for you i think
the avenger is hot

  hurry gulped shane cant
breathe   much longer

  he kept his headlight flashing into
the east presently the blue glare of
rockets grew and sank among the
stars the ship dropped a hundred
yards from him on silent ion-blasts
that brushed rugged lava points with
white incandescence

  the avenger was larger than the
friendship and it carried no disguise
to make it look like a harmless boul-
der the sleeky tapered lines of its
welded gray hull were honestly vi-
cious and deadly

  shane pretended to be half-con-
scious though any such pretense was
almost needless he had waited al-
most too long to make the call the
oxygen pressure was low and the
chemical air-unit had stopped for
want of power

  the glare of jutting rocket-tubes
ceased but a search light speared
him blindingly lights flashed from
the opening valve at the base of the
upright ship portable lights bobbed
toward him across the lava

new britain

men pulled shane upright harsh
voices reached him faintly but
his radio had gone dead along with
the power cells he couldnt under-
stand the dim sounds that came
through the suit he moved to show

that he was still alive and then re-
laxed they carried him through the
valves of the rocket and took him out
of the air-suit it was good to breathe
clean air again but he kept his
breathing slow and his eyes closed
pretending to be out

  an elevator lifted him he was put
in a bed a savage pressure smashed
him against it and he knew the rock-
et was in flight again he heard
voices around him

  captain clayton can you speak

  he had been troubled about the
stubble of beard on his unshaven
face and his counterpart of claytons
narrow mustache the biochemical
treatment of his skin was intended
to give his growing beard and hair
the bronze color of claytons at least
for a few weeks he had been wor-
ried about a possible difference in
shade evidently though they were
accepting him as clayton either the
beard was all right or else these men
didnt know clayton well

  shane muttered something and let
his eyes open blearily men sur-
rounded him he assumed a vacant
unseeing stare yet he managed to
see a good deal these men-officers
doubtless of the avenger-wore
brown uniforms with black stars on
their sleeves did that mean they
were members of the mysterious
black star party

  they began to hammer questions
at him

  what happened to you in amer-
ica do you feel all right what hap-
pened to the friendship have the
americans any defenses besides the
barrier will you advise admiral
gluck to attack

  shane listened and muttered un-
intelligibly still practising the ac-
cent they could think he was out of
his head despite the impatient ques-
tions they displayed respect clay-
ton he realized must be fairly im-
portant

  at last the thrust of rocket-mo-
tors ceased the ship swayed and
gateway to paradise



was still shane knew they had land-
ed he tried to gather his resources
for the next test of the masquerade
deciding that it wasnt safe to pre-
tend half-consciousness any longer
he didnt want the attention of doc-
tors they might too easily find the
scars of his facial operations he
tried weakly to sit up in bed

  hello he muttered so you
picked me up eh

  he thought his accent wasnt bad
and hoped that the half-intentional
weakness of his voice would hide anv
flaws a heavy man in brown
stepped quickly to the side of the
bed

  dont you know me clayton
captain barlow of the avenger
seems we were just in time

  thanks barlow shane tried to
assume claytons grin guess i was
about finished where are we

  the heavy man looked puzzled
you must have been through tor-
ture clayton he clucked sympa-
thetically i can see what an effort
youre making youve got to pull
yourself together weve just come
down to point fourteen admiral
gluck has signaled me to take you
aboard the nemesis to report at
once can you stand up

  i think so mumbled shane
save your voice for the admiral
well fix you up

brown-uniformed orderlies
supported him into a compact
bathroom the tiny spray of water
was disconcerting until he remem-
bered how precious water must be
outside doubtless it was distilled
and used again and again the show-
er refreshed his fatigue-drugged
body and awakened him to new
awareness of the many perils ahead

   the stubble on his face was only a
little too dark but he was glad of the
chance to shave it off with an odd-
looking razor he left the narrow
coppery mustache the mirror
cheered him for it gave back clay-

tons reckless green-eyed grin

  barry shane was appalled by the
endless risks of this desperate game
yet this was just the sort of adven-
ture that sharpened claytons enjoy-
ment of life it helped shane to try
to imagine that he was really the
daring hard-eyed fighting man
whose face he wore

  the orderlies had laid out a brown
uniform that fitted him fairly well
he transfered to its pockets the lit-
tle platinum case of claytons and
the letter from the american cor-
poration control board to atlantis
lee

  a central elevator dropped him
and captain barlow to the base of
the rocket orderlies helped them
into air-suits as they entered the
valve air-pumps throbbed and the
outer gate clanged open shane had
his first glimpse of point fourteen
it made him shudder in the heavy
suit

  it was day again the blinding sun
had come back into the dark change-
less sky above a rugged mountain
wall that marched ink-black across
the east point fourteen was a
roughly leveled plateau dotted with
low domes of gray metal upon it
stood a rocket fleet

  queerly ominous the tapered gray
cylinders stood on end supported by
angular landing stanchions they
glittered under the sun and cast long
stark black shadows they were like
rows of shells in some old munitions
factory before the age of the ring
they were like metal monuments in
some fantastic graveyard of giants

  they were symbols of death-
scores of rocket-bombers

  a cold hand of apprehension
grasped shanes heart america had
no weapon that could stop these evil
machines from destroying the ring
cylinder nor could hope to find one
and this he grimly reminded him-
self was only point fourteen for
all he knew there might be thirteen
other rocket fleets or thirty in the

big helmet he caught his breath

  he could not fail he had to win

  an armored car was waiting at
the air-lock shane and barlow clam-
bered in and it rolled away through
a sinister colonnade of rockets it
jolted heavily on rocks but there
was no sound the silence of the out-
side became queerly oppressive to
shane

  the valves of the nemesis opened
for them and an elevator carried
them up to the quarters of admiral
gluck brown guards admitted them
to a room hung with a barbaric dis-
play of weapons ranging from
curved wooden boomerangs to a du-
plicate of claytons paralysis gun

  well clayton

  the sharp impatient voice was
oddly high almost shrill it came
from a thin little man standing be-
hind a desk as he made a queer
stiff-armed salute with exaggerated
mechanical precision medals jingled
on his brown breast

  shane imitated the salute so this
was admiral gluck he had shaggy
iron-gray hair bushy white brows
over sharp dark hollow eyes and a
luxuriant yellow-stained mustache
his face was lean and stern brown
as his uniform

  at ease captain he sat down
with a tinkle of medals your re-
port

chane caught his breath and
 tried to remonjber all he had
learned of this harsh guttural ac-
cent he let his lean body sag yield-
ing to the real exhaustion in him
he didnt try to keep his voice from
sounding weak and hoarse

  the friendship safely entered
the barrier as ordered sir on a
small island of the florida corpora-
tion i attempted to capture a mem-
ber of the american defense force
which they call the ring guard

  admiral glucks bright sunken
eyes narrowed

  whats wrong with your voice

he shrilled impatiently i can hard-
ly understand you

  shane made a hoarse apologetic
little laugh

  im sorry sir an air-suit cold
that was the diagnosis of his case
that he had overheard and i am
afraid ive been practising ameri-
canese so long that its natural to
me

  gluck shrugged impatiently get
on

  this american destroyed the
friendshipshane told him he
used a hand weapon

  glucks mouth fell open revealing
yellow fangs

  what hand weapon could destroy
an armored rocket he blurted in
amazement

  it looked a little- like a paralysis
gun shane said it didnt make
any beam that you could see but the
rocket crumbled hard steel turned
to fine gray dust i heard the weapon
called a decoherer

  decoherer eh glucks vpice
stammered his dark face turned
darker with anger the pampered
rats think they can defy the black
star do they his tiny eyes glit-
tered shrewdly how is the barrier
machine protected 

  shane shook his bronzed head and
looked solemn

  they call it the ring cylinder
he said it is surrounded with hid-
den batteries of decoherers not
hand machines but powerful pro-
jectors that can send the beam two
thousand miles all the way to the
ring-the barrier

  that was almost a slip shane felt
a little tingle of dread but gluck
hadnt noticed he pounded on the
desk with a gnarled fist

  the black star will smash them
yet he shrilled

  certainly it will sir

  gluck repeated that stiff-armed
salute and shane responded prompt-
ly

 get on the admiral urged
gateway to paradise



sharply how did you escape

  i didnt shane imitated clay-
tons grin he didnt feel a bit like
grinning but he knew that glenn
clayton would have enjoyed this
situation the americans set me
free

  gluck smiled grimly so you
tricked them 

  no i didnt trick them shane
said quietly enough of the friend-
ship was left for them to see t had
come to destroy the barrier but
their defenses are so sure they
werent afraid to let me go

  he let claytons laugh ring scorn-
fully

  they found the letter from at-
lantis lee and took it to their gov-
ernment they dont know the black
star shane attempted claytons
most wolfish grin they sent me
back with a messageof peace

  he showed the gray envelope
addressed to atlantis lee

  you know what it says gluck
demanded

  the american corporation con-
trol board is willing to establish
friendly relations they suggest an
exchange of ambassadors they are
willing to set up a joint commission
to discuss exchanging water for our
oil metals and power cells

  fat fools shrilled gluck vi-
ciously

  they dont - know the black
star shane grinned hoping that
his hard brown face didnt show any
of his alarmed bewilderment about
what the black star really was he
offered the envelope do you want
it sir

  deliver it gluck snapped im-
patiently let your pretty friend
play our game perhaps we should
send an ambassador-to find a way
for our bombers through these
blasted d-decoherers

  yes sir shane said your or-
ders sir

glucks keen little eyes gave him
a startled stabbing look shane

knew he had made  mistake clay-
ton wouldnt have asked for orders
he grinned and tried to chuckle to
make a little joke of it but glucks
dark face remained bleak and grim

  the avenger is ready to take you
back to new dover tomorrow he
said you can present this message
from the plutocratic americans to
atlantis lee no doubt you will take
time to rest from the hardships of
your expedition

  the bushy eyebrows lifted know-
ingly

  thank you sir shane replied
grinning more widely

  he made the stiff-armed salute
once more but he was both puzzled
and alarmed evidently there was
something he didnt know about the
relationship between clayton and
gluck somehow he had blundered

  he was anxious to meet atlantis
lee even though that meeting might
-janbsbui sii jo	aift aq

ade-if as he surmised clayton had
been on close terms with the lovely
girl of the picture

  shane was a little surprised at
himself this was the sort of bold
adventure that would appeal to the
reckless audacity of captain clay-
ton yet he really meant that grin
himself there was something haunt-
ing about that picture of red-haired
violet-eyed atlantis lee

  glucks next shrill words were a
shock

  im calling a general staff con-
ference aboard the nemesis it will
be necessary for you to give a de-
tailed report of your expedition
through the barrier and to answer
all questions about the defenses of
america

  yes sir

  behind claytons hard face shane
felt a chill of dread did this mean
that the little admiral suspected a
grilling by men who doubtless knew
the real clayton would be a difficult
test

  he might never see atlantis lee

enemy of the ring

whitehalls office in the gray
old ring guard headquarters
building was suddenly still even the
clock on the plain military bareness
of the wall seemed to pause in its
muffled ticking

  dr della rand tried to breathe
again struggled to move her frozen
face to speak but she could only
stare at the old general who stood so
precise and straight behind the mili-
tary neatness of his desk she had
thought that he was kind but now
his air of stern decision terrified her

  the eerie howl of rocket-jets broke
that painful silence dully she looked
out through the window something
that looked like a rugged brown
boulder dropped toward the flying
field cushioned on the hot blue flame
of braking ion-jets it settled to an
easy landing and the shriek of jets
was stilled

  claytons machine commented
whitehall the engineers are test-
ing it today he looked back at del-
la rand and she saw the dark
shadow of pain his eyes im sorry
dr rand its been a long time since
the death penalty has been necessary
in civilized america but that is our
decision in such a case involving
the safety of the ring no appeal is
allowed

  della caught her breath with a lit-
tle gasping sound

  perhaps he has to be killed her
voice sounded false and choked and
strange but why must i be the one
to do it

  behind his stern military mask
the slight old guardsman looked un-
comfortable

  secrecy is necessary he ex-
plained it is just possible that the
outsiders have sent another spy into

the ring to find out what became of
clayton perhaps the risk is small
but we cant afford to take chances
if the outsiders learned that clay-
ton is dead that would be the end of
lieutenant shanes masquerade
della made a tiny nod of under-
standing

  you are the only doctor who has
been connected with the case
whitehall went on i dont want to
call in another i am requesting you
to administer euthanasia merely for
claytons sake of course you are
free to refuse in that case ill call a
firing squad for clayton

  her strong hands clenched

 may i have time-time to
think 

  he shook his head the sentence
must be carried out at once ive al-
ready sent for an ambulance to car-
ry claytons body to the ring city
crematory if you wish to refuse
just say so

  she tried to swallow the dry
harsh pain in her throat with an
effort she shut claytons reckless
green-eyed grin out of her mind
her duty seemed clear in a faint
hoarse whisper she said ill do it
whitehall smiled grave approval
when you get to the crematory
he added dont put claytons name
on the death certifications desig-
nate him simply as an enemy of the
ring ill notify the officials what to
expect

  walking across towrard the white
hospital building she paused to stare
at the friendship the testing crew
was just coming out through the
valve they climbed into a waiting
car and drove away three or four
guards were left about the disguised
rocket-bomber

  della felt a painful lump in her
throat destructive as she knew that
machine to be it was still a symbol
of soaring power it stood for clay-
tons hard strength

  now she was going to put clayton
to a nameless death as an enemy
gateway to paradise	

the ambulance startled her it
had come in under silent electric
power but its tires shrieked on the
pavement as it stopped by the side
door of the hospital two men car-
ried a stretcher into the building to
wait for claytons body

  she hurried on the morning sun-
light was suddenly devoid of
warmth her body felt numb and a
little shiver shook her the world
wasnt quite real any longer her ac-
tions were stiff and mechanical

  she found her kit in the locker
room downstairs she went into the
laboratory to mix crystal drops of
instant death with hands that were
like skilful machines no longer part
of her she filled the little needle

  the guards let her into claytons
room the thick vitroid windows
gave a tantalizing view of the broad
flying field with the brown jagged
shape of the friendship at the side
of it but they were stronger than
steel plate they needed no bars

  clayton lay on a mattress on the
floor his hands were manacled in
front of him his ankles were fet-
tered and a short length of chain
secured them to a ring-bolt in the
wall six guardsmen stood in a row
at the other end of the room they
carried no arms lest the prisoner
should secure one of them but there
were six more men in the corridor
outside with plenty of guns the
ring guard was taking no chances
hello beautiful

  the chains made a soft little jingle
as clayton sat up on the mattress
he grinned at her for the moment
his hard green eyes held only amuse-
ment his voice was light and calm
as ever 

  della merely stood there the black
kit clutched in her clammy hands
her numb body ceased to exist a
darkness settled over the room she
couldnt see anything but claytons
grinning face

  good-by clayton said it was
nice of you to come

  she clung to his words and they
steadied her she breathed again
sudden tears flooded her dry and
aching eyes clayton knew that he
was going to be killed and he wasnt
sfrsid

  whats the matter beautiful
he asked arent you going to speak
to me

  she couldnt speak it was all that
she could do to hold back hysteria
his eyes dropped from her face to
the black bag in her tense hands

  oh he said softly youre the
executioner

  mute and ill she nodded amaz-
ingly he grinned again the chains
tinkled as he made a cheerful shrug
his voice was softer than she had
ever heard it

  dont let it get you down he
comforted id rather take the poi-
son from you beautiful than any
other girl i know

  something happened to her then
the agony of that conflict in her
mind became more terrible than she
could endure claytons reckless grin
and that softness of his voice tipped
a balance in her the conflict was
solved

tt wasnt an act of reason her

  tortured mind couldnt reason any
longer it had been a conflict of emo-
tions now while clayton grinned
one emotion won the victory the
other for the time was simply blot-
ted out

  suddenly her purpose was clear
all the numbness left her her
senses and her mind were sharper
than they had ever been in one light-
ning instant the plan was made her
hands were quick and sure

  she opened the black case dis-
carding the needle that she had al-
ready filled with quick and painless
death she filled another with some-
thing else

  clayton watched her from the
mattress on the floor

  quite a treat beautiful his hard


wonder story annual

voice mocked to see your own love-
ly hands mixing the fatal dose

  but she thought that a change had
come into his tone for her alone to
hear it told her that he understood
it thanked her for what she was do-
ing it said that they were comrades
now boldly playing a desperate
game

  youre a cool one beautiful
admiration rang in his voice
youre the kind i like cold steel
tinkled as he waved her a kiss
good-by im ready when you are

  the new needle was filled writh its
imitation death the few bright
drops wrere mixed without research
or tests she realized that any error
might have made them fatal but she
knew she had made no error

  general whitehall was in the door-
way watching silently clayton
grinning managed to slip his own
sleeves up he held out his arms to
wait for the needle it seemed to del-
la that they were steady as iron her
quick hands were steady too she
thrust the tiny point into the vein
and drove the little piston home

  good-by beautiful clayton
murmured wearily

  the hard grin faded her heart
swelled with tenderness when she
saw the face of a tired bewildered
child he went to sleep the fetters
jingled as he fell back on the mat-
tress della put away the needle and
found her stethoscope

  claytons heart made two faint
beats and stooped she gave the in-
strument to general whitehall he
listened then nodded at the guards
they removed the fetters the men
from the crematory came in and un-
rolled their stretcher on the floor
guards lifted claytons limp body
upon it

  della followed down the stairs to
the waiting ambulance that march
seemed to take a thousand years
she was afraid that clayton would
stir too soon the drug should keep
his heart and breath slowed beyond

detection for four or five minutes
after that-

  she started at whitehalls quiet-
voiced statement

  thank you doctor remember
about the certificate

  of course general she asked
the ambulance driver who was wait-
ing by the open doors at the back of
the vehicle may i ride to the cre-
matory with you

  sure doctor he nodded at the
cab get in

  she walked slowly to the cab and
climbed into the seat the key she
saw was in the lock she knew she
must look tense and pale but if these
men noticed they must think it was
because she had just killed a man
not because she hadnt killed him

she watched them slide the
stretcher into the vehicle behind
her silently she slipped behind the
wheel turned the key her foot
found the accelerator she waited
she could scarcely breathe her
heart paused at last the doors were
closed the driver and the two others
came around toward the cab

  hang on she caught part of
whitehalls low-voiced order to two
of the guards see him into the fur-
nace we cant take-

  she stepped on the accelerator
hard tires screamed beneath the
sudden drive of electric power the
ambulance lunged out of the startled
group a breathless shout faded
away

  the ambulance turned on two
wheels jolted across the hospital
lawn and burst through a white-
painted wooden fence lurching and
bouncing it careened across the fly-
ing field toward the jagged brown
hull of the friendship

  she started the siren an ambu-
lance racing across the airport was
not a novelty the guards stationed
about the disguised rocket-bomber
looked about for the crack-up
thanks beautiful
gateway to paradise



  claytons hard voice was still
breathless from the temporary effect
of the drug a little pale he climbed
up into the front seat beside her but
he kept grinning at the startled and
bewildered guards about the friend-
ship

  neat work beautiful

  swiftly searching the glove com-
partment he found a heavy auto-
matic they didnt need it and they
had no time to use it

  one of the guards made a gesture
to wave them away a bullet drilled
a neat hole in the windshield then
he and the man beyond had to fling
themselves desperately out of the
way

  della didnt set the brakes until
she was a few yards from the
friendship its steel hull finished the
task of stopping the ambulance
clayton had flung open the door of
the cab they stumbled toward the
air-lock

  guards were running across the
field stray bullets had begun to ping
on the rockets steel hull but in an-
other second they were aboard clay-
ton slammed the valve and ran to the
controls

  theyve got armored cars
gasped della three of them-un-
der tarpaulins in the hangars-with
cannon

  dont worry beautiful clayton
raised his voice above the mounting
scream of rockets well be a hun-
dred miles high before they can get
them uncovered well be dive-bomb-
ing the ring cylinder before they
know what has happened

atlantis lee

t seemed to barry shane that
he spent a thousand hours at the
long metal table in the wardroom of

the nemesis surrounded by the
brown-uniformed officer of admiral
glucks staff from his long trek
across the dry sea-floor and the
strain of his interview with admiral
gluck shane was near the limit of
exhaustion he didnt try to conceal
that it gave him some excuse for not
mentioning names or promptly
recognizing faces

  but that exhaustion was real his
faculties were slowed and dulled
with it once again he spoke of the
barrier as the ring and heavy cap-
tain barlow challenged him harshly

  forgive me barlow he said
lamely ive been drilling myself
for years to think like an american
that was necessary to prevent un-
conscious slips but the habit per-
sists

  their questions came in battering
volleys it was easy enough to talk
about america the real danger
was that he would display too much
knowledge to half the questions he
said he didnt know to many he
told the truth the more these men
were interested in what he said the
less attention they would pay to
himself he didnt attempt to lie
except to make them believe that
the ring cylinder was impregnably
defended

  at last they were done

  splendid work thick-jowled
barlow applauded the black star
will give you your due for this

  shane felt a tiny shudder of
dread he didnt like barlows small
pigljke eyes several of his ques-
tions had appeared faintly suspi-
cious did barlow mean that he
knew that shane had somehow al-
ready betrayed the impersonation
but the thick-set outsider appeaied
suddenly friendly

  shall we go back to the avenger
clayton i can see youre all in and
i think youll need a bit of life when
we get to new dover tomorrow-
for her eh 


wonder story annual

  his elbow poked into shanes ribs

  thats right barlow

  shane followed gratefully into the
rockets elevator he was all in and
he did want to be at his best tomor-
row his life and the fate of ameri-
ca might turn on what happened
when he met atlantis lee for all
his apprehension he thought the
real clayton himself couldnt have
been more anxious for that meeting

  back aboard the avenger in his
tiny metal-walled room he took out
the platinum case before he went to
sleep and looked again at her pic-
ture her violet eyes smiled at him
grave and sweet only he reminded
himself they were smiling for clay-
ton the more she loved clayton the
more likely she was to discover the
masquerade and the more she would
hate him when she did

  he shut the case and went to
sleep

  the lurch and thrust of accelera-
tion woke him he knew that the
avenger had already taken flight
for new dover he rose and put on
the brown uniform and an orderly
brought him breakfast-a large
bowl of a sweetish yellow gruel

  the outsiders must have few food
animals he knew and probably only
a limited variety of plants prob-
ably this mess was synthetic it did
have a faint sharp chemical taste
such food was one more basis of the
jealous envy of america the para-
dise beyond the barrier

  the elevator took him up to the
control room in the nose of the
rocket captain barlow was not in
evidence the brown-shirted pilot
nodded cheerfully from the intricate
banks of controls

  hello clay he called familiar-
ly want to spell me

  shane knew that he ought to reply
with the pilots name

  thanks he said im not quite
up to it today

  the pilot stared curiously some-
thing must have hit you pretty hard

clay he commented you arent
acting much like iron clayton first
time i ever saw you turn down a
spell at the rod

  shane imitated claytons careless
shrug

  it was pretty tough he tried
to change the subject when do
we get to new dover

  five minutes late evidently he
was supposed to know the schedule
the pilot smiled challengingly at
him unless you want to take the
rod and make it up guess youre
pretty anxious to see atlantis
shane nodded assumed claytons
green-eyed grin

  lucky guy- the pilot looked
sober and lowered his voice-if the
black star lets you keep her

shane didnt dare ask what he
meant he was a little sorry he
had ventured up here he was sup-
posed to knoweverything already
any show of curiousity could give
him away he was glad when the
pilot had to look back to his instru-
ments and controls

  shane looked out through the ob-
servation port the view was both
magnificent and appalling forget-
ful of the danger he caught his
breath in audible wonderment

  the rocket was at least a hundred
miles high it was early morning
and long inky shadows made the
convex mountainous landscape ap-
pear almost as rugged as earths
long-lost moon in pictures shane
had seen the lateral thrust of the
rockets altered his sense of down so
that the stark cragged surface of
the planet seemed crazily tilted

  youve changed clay the
pilots cheerful voice alarmed him
staring at the scenery like a yellow
cub atlantis has got into your
blood all right

  shane shrugged and tried to grin
claytons reckless grin he was
more and more certain he would
sooner or later betray himself
gateway to paradise



  presently the rugged desert of the
ocean floor tipped beneath them and
swung vertiginously back shane
knew that this was mid-flight the
rocket was reversed for decelera-
tion he moved to another view-port
to watch for the first glimpse of
new dover

  there she is

  there was nothing that shane
could see except new expanses of
stark desolation plain on plain of
dried sea-mud walled with range on
cragged range of wild black-shad-
owed volcanic mountains but the
cheerful pilot nodded at the tele-
scope beside him

 through the lenses shane
glimpsed the city new dover stood
on the end of a high rugged dark
plateau the gray-white metal that
walled it against the outsides grim
hostility was probably some alumi-
num alloy it was really more a flat
disc than a dome several upright
rockets stood on the level center of
it grouped about it were a number
of smaller domes more rockets
stood upon a long dark rectangle

  beyond the city lay fields of dull
yellow the plateau was covered
square mile on square mile with
close-set blocks of yellow for a mo-
ment shane was completely puzzled
then he remembered the gold-film
storage cells of the friendship here
were the solar power accumulators
drinking up the suns tremendous
energy

  he was startled by the pilots
cheery voice

  anybody would think you had
never seen new dover well youll
be seeing her in an hour say do
you think youll be at dins to-
night

  sure reluctantly shane gave
up the telescope he decided he had
better get out of here before he gave
himself away see you there ive
got another report to write

  he returned to his tiny stateroom
blue-jowled captain barlow came

in a few moments later and began to
ask more questions about america
the pig-eyed officer seemed eager
and friendly-altogether too eager
and friendly shane tried not to
show his relief when the avenger
landed

  the ship descended upon the flat-
tened top of the low metal dome her
wheels dropped after the landing
stanchions had absorbed the shock
of descent and dock-hands in air-
suits rolled her over a valve in the
citys roof her bottom valve was
sealed against the opening so that
the ships elevator could drop
through the roof to the top level of
the city

  shane stepped out of the little
cage with captain barlow at his
side he mustnt seem to be too in-
terested or astonished yet his life
might depend on what he could
quickly see and understand swiftly
he looked about him

  the elevator had come down into
a long space like a covered wharf
up and down it other cages were
rising and descending there were
piles of crates and bales and kegs
and bright metal ingots sweaty
men with silent electric trucks and
cranes were moving cargo

outside through broad door-
ways he glimpsed one of the
streets of new dover it was roofed
of course and narrow so that it was
really more like a corridor the
pavement was moving steadily per-
haps the street below he thought
moved in the opposite direction

  the people he saw looked hardy
and vigorous they were rather
scantily clad in variously colored
lustrous metallic-looking material
the warm conditioned air didnt call
for much clothing and fabrics were
probably rather scarce and expen-
sive

  shane was a little surprised at
these evidences of vigor and indus-
trial efficiency new dover didnt
wonder story annual

look like a city about to perish for
want of a few gallons of water per-
haps clayton had been lying

  here she is clayton

  it was barlows heavy voice once
again shane thought he seemed too
friendly his small heavy-lidded
eyes seemed almost suspiciously
watchful in a moment however
shane forgot all his apprehensions
about barlow-for he saw atlantis
lee

  shane had been prepared for the
ordeal of some ceremonial reception
fitted to the importance of the secre-
tary of new britain he was ex-
pecting brass bands or their out-
side equivalent but the girl came
to him across the busy wharf quite
alone he had a few seconds to
study her to try to guess how the
real glenn clayton would have
greeted her

  she was a little taller than he had
expected her red hair had gleam-
ing lights that the miniature had
only suggested she wore a sort of
tunic of a dull lustrous green her
walk was deliberate proud she
really had the manner of a ruler and
she was truly beautiful

  shane knew that he was staring
breathless he knew the real clay-
ton wouldnt be doing that clayton
wouldnt merely surrender to the
beauty of atlantis he would grin
his reckless grin and-

  suddenly shane wasnt sure ex-
actly what clayton would do as
the girl came up to him he was
seized with panic he realized that
disaster was near but he was para-
lyzed he couldnt think he couldnt
move

  hello glenn

  the girl stopped in front of him
her violet eyes smiled gravely she
was lovelier than the picture had
hinted the sheer beauty of her set
a pleasant ache throbbing in his
heart then he was shaken with a
black and bitter jealousy for clay-
ton

  she was speaking again he could
hardly hear the words he knew
that her voice was softly melodious
somehow quite free of the twangy
harshness that seemed to character-
ize the english of new britain

  im glad that you came safely
home she said do you hve an
answer from the americans glenn 
anxiety put tenseness in her voice
and there was a cool note of scorn
or did the black star refuse to let
you deliver our message of peace to
america 

  shane saw the hurt in her violet
eyes desperately he broke the panic
that chained him he caught his
breath and tried once more to im-
agine that he was the real glenn
clayton he tried to grin claytons
reckless green-eyed grin

  youre so beautiful that for a
moment i couldnt think

  captain barlow was standing
near his small beady eyes were
quickly watchful shane thought the
heavy man had stiffened impercepti-
bly at the girls mention of the black
star he was almost sure that bar-
low had begun to suspect but he
tried to forget the black star

  he did the thing he was certain
that the real glenn clayton should
have done he swept the girl into his
hard arms his eager face brushed
through her fragrant hair he
kissed her soft startled lips thirst-
ily

  the next instant shane knew that
he had made a mistake

the dream of eden

the anti-aircraft batteries about
the ring cylinder and the ring
guard headquarters patterned the
sky with bursts of white but the
escaping friendship was far too
gateway to paradise



swift for their range-finders the
howl of rockets faded as she came
up through the stratosphere

  della rands dark eyes looked into
claytons reckless grin

  therell be no dive-bombing the
ring cylinder her voice was low
and shaken i thought of that be-
fore i helped you get away i knew
that all the bombs had been un-
loaded from the friendship that
was a safety precaution before the
test flights began

  thanks anyhow beautiful
glenn clayton locked the controls
he turned to della rand his green
eyes bright with elation he took
her in his hard arms and kissed her
despite the monstrous alarm that
had awakened in her she liked the
ruthless pressure of his lips

  that doesnt matter he told
her in three hours well be back
to point fourteen theyll load the
bomb-racks for us there and we can
leave word with the patrol to look
for lieutenant shane

  della rand thrust her body out of
his arms

  do you think ill let you do
that her face had turned a little
pale but her dark eyes flashed do
you think ill let you kill america
clayton grinned what did you
think you were doing beautiful
when you set me free

  i didnt have time to think i
only knew i couldnt kill you she
stared at his brown face bit her
quivering lip perhaps we could
hide the ship somewhere you cant
go on with this insane attack against
the ring

  his face set grimly the black
star doesnt owe america anything
the breaking of the barrier will
give us the water we need that has
been planned since the time when
america was only an unpleasant
legend all our cities are built
where they wont be flooded when
your precious bit of ocean pours
down

   della rand tried not to shudder
you owe something to one ameri-
can she reminded him in a low
urgent voice you owe your life
to me

   he gave her his green-eyed grin
dont you worry beautiful he
said im going to pay that debt
personally to you his hard fingers
caught her arm drew her almost
roughly to him this way

   she yielded to his kiss found it
queerly sweet but already she was
planning what she must do it had
been impossible for her to murder
clayton it was equally impossible
for her to let clayton murder
america

  thank you darling he whis-
pered ill never let you be sorry
but she could see that his greenish
eyes remained alertly watchful per-
haps she had the shadow of a chance
yet she knew it would not be easy

   when the wail of the rockets grew
silent she realized they were above
the restraining air the sky was
purple-black above and the gray
misty convexity of america rotated
beneath them as clayton took the
controls again she moved away
from him

  wait he said better stay
where i can watch you

  the gun he had found in the am-
bulance was thrust in his belt it
made her a little ill to realize that
he would use it unhesitatingly
against her she watched his brown
busy hands at the controls he kept
talking easily to her as if they were
at peace but she knew that it was
impossible to do anything now she
could only wait and hope for the
chance to come

   the dim line of the atlantic coast
drifted back beneath them and pres-
ently della rand knew that the in-
visible wall of the ring was near
testing the polarizer clayton
watched her with a new alertness
the chance didnt come

  she didnt know just when they
	wonder story annual

crossed the ring but she saw that
the misty atlantic was sliding away
behind them cut off as if by a long
curved blade beneath was the bar-
ren mountain desert where once the
sea had flowed outside

 clayton seemed to relax he
grinned at her and began testing a
new piece of equipment

  were through the barrier in
half an hour we can signal point
fourteen and tell them to send pa-
trols to look for lieutenant shane

  half an hour-still there was a
chance

  kiss me darling clayton said
youll never be sorry

all her surgeons strength and
quiektvess flowed mto the fovgers
that snatched the heavy automatic
out of claytons belt she didnt
wait to threaten him because no
threat would have meant anything
to clayton he would have used any
delay to take the weapon back

  she fired instantly yet her sur-
geons skill was in control she
didnt want to kill him no matter
what he was she would never want
to do that she tried to do nothing
that her skill could not repair

  the gun made a frightful sound
it leaped in her hand and hot smoke
stung her face claytons hard body
jerked to the bullets impact she
felt a stab of pain as if it had been
her own flesh but she clung to her
purpose she stepped away from
clayton before he could gather any
strength she sent a second bullet
into the radio so that it could never
send out the message that would be-
tray barry shane

  you win beautiful

  claytons voice seemed to hold no
anger only admiration the bullet
had torn his side horribly it must
have gone deeper than she meant
already blood was flowing but
claytons pale tense face contrived
to grin

  let me set her down he whis-

pered i can hold out for that

  he clung for a moment to the con-
sole then lowered himself carefully
into the big metal seat still deft
his fingers touched the controls the
ship spun and delia felt the crush-
ing pressure of deceleration 

  already she was on her knees be-
side him trying to stop the blood
that ruthless pressure made it diffi-
cult and multiplied the strain on his
heart but clayton clung grimly to
his task and brought the rocket
down

  it crashed with bruising dazing
force against the flank of a dark
volcanic summit that once the sea
had flooded but the tough hull took
the shock there was no shriek of
escaping air

  well darling clayton breathed
here we are

  consciousness flowed out with his
leaking blood but della got him
out of the chair with a strength
she had never known she possessed
she carried him back to the bunk
she found an emergency surgical kit
and dressed the wound after cauter-
izing it

  clayton would live in two weeks
she thought he would be able to
walk

  she wasnt sure that the radio had
been hopelessly destroyed she made
sure then one by one she smashed
the six ion-blast rocket tubes in their
ports and the six spares she found
in the storeroom aft

  that made the frier  ship quite
helpless the caterpillar tracks with
which the disguised machine had
been able to move over the ground
like a crawling boulder had been
hopelessly smashed when barry
shane landed it at headquarters
they had been removed for repair
and had not been replaced nor
could either of them leave the ma-
chine the air-suit in which barry
shane had ventured outside was the
only escape equipment that had been
aboard
gateway to paradise



  the charge in the gold-film cells
would della knew last indefinitely
the banks of cells would keep the
air-machine in operation condens-
ing exhaled moisture and liberating
oxygen from it there were suffi-
cient supplies of food to last for sev-
eral months in addition the air-
machine made starch and glucose

della rand came back to clay-
ton all the reckless hardness
had gone from his face his mon-
strous purpose to shatter the ring
and destroy america seemed com-
pletely incredible now smiling a
little she softly smoothed his fore-
head

  after all she had managed things
well it would have been difficult for
them to hide in america here she
supposed there would be little dan-
ger on the crown of this rugged
range one more boulder would hard-
ly be discovered she forgot that she
was a brisk efficient surgeon she
let herself dream the disguised
hulk of the fallen rocket was a tiny
world secure against invasion she
and the tall outsider could find a
kind of happiness here

  the dream ran on in case some
catastrophe did overtake america
in spite of shanes efforts she and
clayton might survive the break-
ing of the ring would make a new
sea in the dry valley below them
perhaps the deep would hold enough
air so that they could breathe in
time they might emerge from the
friendship-a new adam and an-
other eve

  della bent and her lips brushed
his gently

  thanks beautiful

  his faint whisper shocked her
she searched the pale mask of his
face

  do you really mind glenn she
asked do you mind so very much

  dont you worry beautiful he
tried to grin i didnt really need
to get back your bold american

spy will be taken care of without
any help from me

  what do you mean she whis-
pered apprehensively

  theres a man named barlow
who wants my place in the black
star his whisper explained i was
playing him along until i could learn
all about his plot claytons pale
lips smiled as if deadly intrigue had
been merely an exciting game bar-
low no doubt will take care of
shane itll be a good joke on both
of them

  della rand bit her lip oh if i
hadnt smashed the rockets-

  but you did beautiful clay-
tons green eyes mocked her were
stuck here together shane might
be on another planet for all the
warning you can give him he
grinned do you mind-so very
much 

  for answer della bent and kissed
his lips lightly

  thanks beautiful he mur-
mured

  he closed his eyes thinking
when the time came to leave the
friendship he could manage it
some rocket would pass in sight of
them he wouldnt need a radio a
signal light would do he smiled
again thinking how confused bar-
low would be when the treacherous
rat found he had murdered the
wrong clayton

times up traitor

on that busy wharf under the
metal roof of new dover at-
lantis lee stiffened in shanes em-
bracing arms her lips were cold to
his they drew away and the red-
haired secretary of new britain
spoke quietly

  let me go glenn
	wonder story annual

  that was all she said but the icy
restraint of her voice seemed to
cover something more than pain and
anger her calm tone stung like a
slap in the face shane released her
and stepped back he knew that the
hard brown features that della
rands surgery had given him the
living mask of glenn clayton were
flushed with an unwonted color of
confusion but he forgot to wonder
what clayton would have done

  i-im sorry he stammered
please-

  its a little late to be sorry now
her voice was painful as a whip i
could never understand you glenn
certainly ill never make an attempt
again

  she stepped away from him so
that heavy-pig-eyed captain barlow
stood almost between them her face
was cold as marble and her violet
eyes were dark with the shadow of
some old hurt shane couldnt un-
derstand clayton either he was
suddenly bewildered and angry at
whatever clayton had done to make
this girl despise him so but that
feeling didnt help he had his
masquerade to think about his life
and the safety of america

  sorry beautiful he tried to
grin claytons hard reckless grin
you used to forgive me

  it hurt him to see the wrath on
her face yet he knew that clayton
would have enjoyed it and he kept
grinning her red head jerked an-
grily the smooth column of her
throat pulsed as she swallowed she
tried visibly to smooth the pain and
the anger away

  rage is becoming to you beauti-
ful he commented lightly it sets
a sparkle in your eyes

  please glenn

  her voice was low and grave
with one little nod she seemed to
dismiss everything that had hap-
pened her violet eyes flashed with
a proud humility a painful lump
came into shanes throat he wanted

desperately to make peace to get
her forgiveness to take away all
her hurt but he had to keep in
character

  okay beautiful he tossed her
the thick gray envelope that held
americas offer of peace of water in
a fair exchange for oil and metals
and power it fell on the floor he
picked it up and gave it to her lazily
this ought to make you happy
he stood admiring the uncon-
scious grace of her hands as she tore
open the gray envelope and anxious-
ly unfolded the heavy stiff letter-
head of the american corporation
control board her violet eyes
drank in the message it did make
her happy

  glenn its wonderful i knew the
americans couldnt be so bad as the
black star claims i knew they
would be generous if we would just
give them a chance tears brimmed
in her eyes glenn i could kiss
you

  here i am he said

  amazingly she did kiss him she
laughed and her warm lips lightly
brushed his cheek he didnt dare
take her in his arms again

  glenn i could never understand
you she repeated her bewildered
violet eyes searching his face you
knew-you must have known-what
this letter said and still you brought
it to me then a doubt was on her
white face or is this just one of
your jokes

  shane forgot to grin it isnt a
joke he said soberly

  the americans are really willing
to be friendly

  of course they are he told her
i think they would give us water
to relieve our temporary distress
without any payment at all but
they do need oil and metals and
power they are anxious to open
trade

beside him captain barlow
made an abrupt angry move-
gateway to paradise



ment he said nothing but his
heavy greasy face had a sullen look
shane wished that barlow hadnt
heard wandered what he wanted
what he was waiting for the girl
herself looked surprised

  do you mean that glenn you
arent just trying to hurt me
again 

  of course i mean it beautiful
remembering that he was clayton
he grinned did you think that i
was a green-eyed monster

  maybe i did she said gravely
she scanned his face again he saw
that the letter was trembling in her
hands i cant believe it will you
come to the league will you tell
them that 

  she waited anxiously for his an-
swer at shanes side captain bar-
low cleared his throat it was a noisy
bark of warning shane hesitated
didnt barlow have anywhere to go 
another thought made him shiver
he didnt like the way barlow clung
to him now he thought he guessed
the big mans purpose

  it had seemed a little odd that
admiral gluck had been so willing
to grant shane two weeks leave
his unexpected report about the de-
coherer must have precipitated a
crisis in the plans of the black star
whatever they were it was a little
strange that clayton the one man
who knew the most about america
and that imaginary weapon could
be so readily spared-unless ad-
miral gluck suspected something

  looking at barlows pig-eyed face
shane tried not to shudder were
they just giving him enough rope
to hang himself was barlow de-
tailed to shadow him to keep a rec-
ord of all his slips and errors until
the evidence was certain

  slowly shane turned back to at-
lantis lee she was an ally besides
she was beautiful it made his heart
beat faster just to look at her he
knew he loved her already he
wanted to tell her who he really was

yet he didnt dare perhaps she
wanted peace with america but still
she was a citizen of new britain he
wondered if she wasnt uncon-
sciously and unwillingly still in love
with glenn clayton she couldnt
be expected to aid an american spy

  he would have to tell her that it
was he who had captured clayton
that the ring guard had decided
that the prisoner must die before
shane left america he was in a
way responsible for claytons death
he couldnt tell her

  will you come glenn she asked
again urgently will you speak to
the league

  sure beautiful he grinned
ill tell them anything you like
that wasnt what he wanted to
say but he had to keep in character
within the limitations of his role
he was determined to do all he could
to help the cause of peace if trade
were actually begun before the only
defense of america was found to be
a lie the disaster might be averted
atlantis bit her lip annoyed
ill telegraph the delegates she
said at last the league will meet
at twelve tomorrow her shoulders
stiffened defiantly under the green
tunic perhaps the black star has
taken the real power perhaps the
league is just a shadow but it still
has a constitutional authority for
once ill take the risk of using it
her violet eyes were pleading if
you will come glenn really

  ill come shane told her sober-
ly-

  she smiled and took his hand- her
grasp was firm and cool and it made
his heart beat faster then she left
him shane watched her go with a
dull ache in his throat he was sorry
she had gone

suddenly he was uncomfort-
ably aware of captain barlow
waiting beside him-waiting he
suspected for him to make some
fatal blunder shane didnt know


wonder story annual

what to do next he didnt know
where clayton would stay in new
dover he didnt even know where
the league would meet next day
still barlow waited his piggy eyes
watchful

  going my way shane said des-
perately

  all right the blue-jowled face
was a heavy mask that betrayed no
thought if you have anything to
drink at the apartment

  at least he knew now that clayton
had an apartment it was cheering
news-if barlow would guide him
to it that would give him a chance
to relax if too many friends of clay-
ton didnt unexpectedly turn up
after he got rid of barlow he ought
to be able to learn a few things by
studying claytons papers and ef-
fects

  there ought to be something
he made a weary little gesture
glad to have you along barlow
im about all in today

  you arent acting yourself the
heavy man agreed

  again shane tried not to shudder
he tried to hope that his apprehen-
sion had no base but the double
meaning in barlows words seemed
ominously clear

  displaying a fatigue that he real-
ly felt he let barlow lead the way
another elevator dropped them four
levels they stepped upon the mov-
ing floor of a corridor-street at a
corner they descended a stair to an-
other moving at right angles

  at last barlow stepped off in front
of a door and waited for shane to
open it shane had claytons ring of
keys fortunately the second one he
tried happened to fit but he thought
that barlows small animal eyes re-
flected new suspicion

  the apartment was larger and
more luxurious than he had antici-
pated there were half a dozen spa-
cious rooms the chill of metal walls
was relieved with tapestries deep-
piled rugs perhaps of some mineral

fiber covered the floor shane didnt
know where to look for a drink

  help yourself he told barlow
if you can find anything i just
want to rest

  he dropped into a big chair found
he didnt have to simulate exhaus-
tion barlow went into another
room presently he came back with
two tall glasses he cleared his
throat and said

  dont vou think youre going too
far

  shane blinked and prevented him-
self from shivering he managed to
keep his hand steady as he accepted
the drink

  what do you mean he asked
  youll find out tonight

  it sounded like a threat staring
sullenly barlow drained his glass
and wiped his thick lips on the back
of a hairy hand he stamped out of
the room puzzled and worried
shane locked the door behind him

  shane began an anxious search
for information in the bedroom
were several pictures of women all
different all with endearing inscrip-
tions that was hard to understand
when there had been atlantis lee

  he paused in the dressing room to
try on some of claytons clothing
the garments didnt fit exactly the
outsider had been slightly taller
larger straighter in far-off ring
city making the plan shane had
hardly thought of clothing now
when he was wondering what to
wear when he spoke before the
league tomorrow the matter as-
sumed an alarming importance

  the letters and other metal foil
documents in a big desk reveaed
nothing new clayton must have
hidden or destroyed every important
document before he started on the
adventure to america

at last behind a tapestry
shane found the door of a con-
cealed wall safe he caught his
breath perhaps this held the evi-
gateway to paradise



dence that would show claytons
connection with the black star or
something else equally revealing
but he was unable to open the com-
bination lock tomorrow he would
try to find a locksmith

  he settled down to study one of
the odd metal foil newspaper rolls
the advertising gave him the names
of streets and stores and resorts
lists and prices of commodities a
thousand items that he might des-
perately need to know

  a heavy knock interrupted him
tense to face a new emergency
shane laid aside the roll and magni-
fier and unlocked the door barlow
thrust himself into the room fol-
lowed by four nervous men in
brown they all wore paralysis
guns barlows blue-jowled face was
damp with perspiration

  sorry to disturb you his voice
was hoarse and uneasy just a
routine matter his trembling
hands pushed out a rolled sheet of
gray metal foil if youll just put
the black star seal on this war-
rant

  shane blinked and gulped

  the seal he caught himself
and tried to conceal his astonish-
ment with narrowed eyes he sur-
veyed the sweating men again for
a routine matter you all look pretty
excited

  barlow thrust the rattling sheet
at him

   its no secret that you are leader
of the black star no secret to us
his piglike eyes glittered anxiously
you keep the seal here

  shane swallowed again and tried
to stop the room from spinning
this was astounding clayton him-
self was the secret leader of the
black star

  for a moment that seemed in-
credible if clayton had such power
why hadnt he sent some subordi-
nate on the dangerous mission to
america the answer was claytons
own character besides it was pos-

sible that the prestige won by his
successful preliminary expeditions
had helped earn the leadership

  shane bit his lip it was no won-
der that clayton had refused to talk
about the black star if shane had
known this he might have been able
to assume that power for himself
now as he faced the uneasy omi-
nous faces of the men in brown it
seemed too late

  wheres the seal demanded
barlow

  that was what shane also wanted
to know in all his searches of this
apartment the friendship and
claytons own person he hadnt
found anything that could be the
seal of course it might be in that
safe but clayton more likely had
hidden it so cleverly he would never
find it at all in the time these men
would give him

  shanes eyes challenged barlow
it seems to me youre a little too
curious about where i keep the seal
this looks like a ruse to get your
hands on it he glanced briefly at
the metal foil document what is
it

  barlow wet his lips and blinked
his small animal eyes two of the
men stepped alertly to his side the
others moved behind shane their
hands stayed near their guns

  we have information that atlan-
tis lee is calling a special meeting
of the league barlows voice was
flat and ominous she is plotting
to deal with our enemies in america
in defiance of the black star

  on the contrary shane said
she told me about this meeting i
am going to attend myself what is
that document

  barlow glared at him this is a
warrant for the arrest of atlantis
lee on the charge of suspicion of
treason the metal sheet rattled as
he added the time has come for
the black star to smash the last
vestige of the league

  shane stepped forward you
	wonder story annual

knew i wouldnt put the seal to
that he made his voice crack
hard you knew i was going to
speak at the league

  barlow flinched uneasily from his
eyes

  let me tell you now shane
rapped the extreme policies of the
black star are going to be changed
i have learned that the americans
are willing to be friendly we can
get far more by peaceful trade than
by war ill never order and never
allow another attack on the bar-
rier

  barlow crumpled up the warrant
and threw it on the floor

  thats what we wanted to know
his voice was a tense hurried
croaking the aim of the black
star from the very beginning has
been to destroy the barrier it is as
important to avenge ourselves on
those who shut us outside as it is to
fill our own seas again any man
who opposes that purpose is a trai-
tor to the black star

  his sweaty face made an uneasy
grimace

  ive been planning to get you
clayton he rasped ever since you
beat me out of the leadership but i
never hoped youd lay yourself so
wide open i used to think you were
clever but your times up traitor

life was a dream

della rand aboard the friend-
ship had fired the bullet with
a surgeons knowledge after the
disguised rocket fell upon that bleak
volcanic summit which once the
atlantic had covered she had re-
paired glenn claytons wound with
a surgeons care and skill she
couldnt fail the tall outsiders
hard green-eyed grin moved her

with a feeling that was as strong as
her love for america always she
had risen to emergencies a calm
confidence ruled her hands she had
no fear of blunders

  the wound healed swiftly soon-
er than she had expected clayton
was able to leave his bunk for tiny
expeditions about the disabled ma-
chine he showed no gfeat concern
about the smashed rocket-tubes

  well beautiful youre thorough
he complimented still a little pale
and hollow his hard face grinned
you must like my company taking
such precautions as this

  he put his arms around her and
she was careful not to hurt his heal-
ing wound when he kissed her she
liked the harshness of the stubble on
his chin she closed her eyes and let
herself dream again of the new
adam and another eve

  glenn clayton let her dream now
he had a role to play and a secret to
keep he was resolved to make no
blunder he kissed her and they
went on with the business of taking
an inventory of the supplies aboard

  the air machine manufactures
carbohydrates he told her with
that we can keep going two years
anyhow his green eyes seemed
warm and kind like the prospect
beautiful

  she did and she let him know it
for two years would be an eternity
of paradise there was scarcely any
need to look beyond that time but
she let herself dream of a day when
they might walk out of the rocket
to begin a new life somewhere

  clayton let her go on dreaming
della didnt object when he set up
the telescope the instrument was
small the perfect vision in the air-
less outside together with a power-
ful system of electronic amplifica-
tion made large lenses or reflectors
needless the image was reflected
on a screen

  time here will hang heavy beau-
tiful he said even for you and
gateway to paradise



me we must plan our lives in this
world of ours keep doing things
lets have a look at the stars

  della didnt guess his purpose
she was eager to follow any interest
of his happy because he was accept-
ing this situation with such appar-
ent cheer the control room in the
nose of the helpless ship became
their observatory

  glenn clayton proved to be an
excellent astronomer the outsiders
had lived for two centuries under
perfect astronomical conditions the
catastrophe of the passing dwarf
had given them a sharp if rather
apprehensive interest in the mys-
teries of illimitable space clayton
as she already knew had a keen and
readyroind

  the little round screen was black
or sometimes gray with dusty nebu-
lae stars swam across it and
seemed to come near or recede again
as claytons fingers moved the con-
trols he was talking easily to della
who sat beside him on the big chairs
arm about the wonders of the
southern constellations they ex-
plored

  he started when he saw the ob-
ject

  there he whispered then
sensing the alarm that he had
caused he tried to allay it a
comet he pointed to a tiny fleck
of white that della soon lost again
among the dazzling stars it must
be a comet because it wasnt there
last night were discoverers beau-
tiful

for a moment she felt admiration
for his photographic memory of
the heavens fondly she touched his
hard shoulder and a sudden doubt
shocked her his shoulder was tense
she felt his concealed excitement

  whats so important about a
comet she asked

  nothing beautiful he grinned
but its the first new thing thats
happened today

  della chilled to a secret fear that
life might grow stale for them in the
tiny world of the ship she was
afraid that clayton would find a
way to leave her and the dim dread
turned to dark alarm

  is that a ship she whispered
clayton had thought that it was
the blast-glow of a distant barrier
patrol rocket that was what had
startled him but in a moment he
knew that his hope was defeated

  no such luck beautiful a ship
would move much faster

  alarm had chilled her voice

  a ship wouldnt see the friend-
ship she told him we look like a
boulder you arent to signal glenn
im stronger than you are till your
side gets well

  his pale grin mocked her

  but only till i get well he
looked back at the little screen
anyhow beautiful weve got a
whoie new comet to amuse us

  she tried to follow his work he
increased the electronic magnifica-
tion enormously until the tiny fleck
of the comet crawled visibly across
the screen with instruments he
recorded the rate of its motion

  the elements he said at last
now wheres it going

  she couldnt follow any farther
but he took readings from the in-
strument and set them up on a little
calculator the first result banished
his grin he turned back quickly to
the telescope screen for another ob-
servation

  wthat have you found della
wanted to know

  nothing he said nothing that
could be

  that was all that he would tell
her but he worked on and on
through the night until the slow
rotation of the heavens carried the
strange body below the ragged
southern horizon even then he
waited to check the positions of
venus and mars before he slept

  all the next night he worked
	wonder story annual

again silent and abstracted then
at last he told her

  you might as well have saved
your bullet beautiful his lean
face was haggard from the long ef-
fort his voice had a gravity that
was new yet something made him
grin sardonically that comet is
going to smash the barrier and
your precious america more com-
pletely than all our rockct-bombers
could have done

  she clutched at the big chairs
arm for support

  the ring is strong she pro-
tested its strong enough to stop
the heaviest meteors

  this is more than a meteor
beautiful

  tense and breathless she waited
for him to go on even now his
hard voice rang lightly it seemed
to her that clayton rejoiced in dan-
ger she had never seen him afraid

  its more than a comet too its
round and solid and it doesnt have
any tail its still so far away that i
cant measure it very closely and
i still havent been able to estimate
its mass from the perturbations of
other planets his green eyes
seemed maliciously gleeful but i
can guess darling

  she tried twice before her husky
whisper came what can you
guess 

  it is coming out of the same part
of the sky where the dwarf disap-
peared two hundred years ago after
it had stripped the air and the
oceans off the earth-except under
your precious ring sweetheart
you think- della gulped you
think this is the dwarf

  why not he asked lightly its
the same size its coming from the
same direction of course the as-
tronomers two hundred years ago
said that it was going to go on in
space never to return but astron-
omy was pretty well disorganized
by the time the dwarf had passed
suppose they were mistaken its

mass was only a fraction of the suns
suppose that it was pulled into a
long cometary orbit suppose that
it is just now returning for a second
visit anyhow darling thats my
guess

  she stared at his brown smiling
face she didnt know what to be-
lieve perhaps it was all a joke or
a ruse to get her to let him signal a
ship

  how close will it come this
time her low voice asked

  the aim seems to be improv-
ing a shadow drowned the reck-
less glint of his eyes thats what
ive been working on these past two
nights his bronze head made a
grave little nod this time sweet-
heart the dwarf isnt going to miss
us

  she stepped back a little and her
voice went sharp glenn is this a
joke

  he shook his head none of
mine anyhow beautiful if the
forces that rule the cosmos have a
sense of humor it may be a joke to
them but that body is coming
straight toward earths orbit
collision is inevitable there wont
be much left

  her exhaled breath made a tiny
sob

  even your precious barrier
wont be much use he told her
after the whole planet is smashed
into white-hot vapor tf this is a
joke it is one on the whole human
race the black star as well as
america even on your daring
lieutenant shane

the black star seal

tn claytons apartment listen-
ing to captain barlows harsh-
voiced threat shane reached for the
gateway to paradise



paralysis gun at his hip the two
men behind him seized his arms be-
fore he could draw it

  hold him barlow rasped from
a safe distance get the gun he
came closer when shane was dis-
armed his broad face leering
triumphantly all right clayton
where is it

  wheres what evaded shane

  while the two men held shane
barlow threatened him with the
thick cylinder of his paralysis gun

  you know what he snarled
i want the black star seal you
know that it is the rule for each
leader of the black star to hand the
seal and his authority on to another
-before he dies his voice went
hard with menace wheres the
seal

  i dont know that was the
truth but shane managed claytons
mocking grin he tried not to reveal
the despair he felt barlow obvious-
ly meant to murder him even if he
had the emblem of authority it
would be of no use to him now he
added you might take a look
around

  were going to said barlow his
look malevolent

  at his curt nod the two sweaty
men behind him nervously stepped
forward to search shanes pockets
they found only the little platinum
case

  it might be too large to carry
barlow said or he might be afraid
to carry it search the rooms he
made a noisy gulp and hurry
dont stand there like a pair of
frightened fools

  pale and uneasy the two ran
and began rummaging frantically
through the several rooms shane
watched trying to maintain clay-
tons reckless grin

  frankly barlow he said in the
words he thought clayton might
have spoken i dont believe youll
like it you seem uneasy already
and the longer you hold the seal the

more youll have to be afraid of
blast you clayton the big man
growled where is it

  theres a wall-safe behind the
tapestry in the second room shane
told him you might try that

  in a moment the men found the
safe but barlow was afraid to let
them touch it

  leave it alone he warned un-
certainly it might be a bomb or
an alarm he was a bit too willing
to tell us where it was his pig-
eyes came watchfully back to shane
clayton i think we had better dis-
pose of you without any further
delay

  go ahead shane shrugged and
tried to ignore the prickle of dead-
ly apprehension along his spine
barlows obvious fear only made the
big man more dangerous more anxi-
ous to get him out of the way he
tried to grin what are your
plans

  anxiously the men in brown had
leveled their weapons the paraly-
sis guns shane realized were ideal
for such an occasion used at full
power on the higher nerve centers
they were instantly deadly and they
made no sound shane waited for
the black impact of death

  no not yet barlow stopped
them and turned to shane clayton
ill give you a choice hand over the
seal without any tricks or fuss and
you can have a nice easy death
they say a man never even feels the
ray on his brain

  shane had to swallow before he
could trust his voice

  and he prompted what if i
refuse

  well take you to the vacuum
cell that fits our plans much better
anyhow it will appear in the records
of the black star that you were
tried by a party court and sentenced
to the vacuum cell for treason the
cell isnt comfortable for a live man
his broad face was thrust forward
whats your choice clayton
	wonder story annual

  shane shrugged i dont want to
spoil your hunt for the seal his
borrowed voice rang out light and
clear but he felt numb and cold and
ill his own words seemed to come
from far away youll have to take
me to the cell

  barlows thick lips quivered with
anger

  lets sec your grin in the vacuum
cell-with your own blood boiling
out of your body the gaping muz-
zle of his weapon gestured at the
door get moving

dimly shane had hoped that the
trip to the vacuum cell where-
ever it was would give him some op-
portunity to escape or to call for aid
but barlows plot was more com-
pletely organized than he could have
suspected

  the moving pavement outside
was stopped ropes were stretched
across the corridor-street at the
ends of the block brown-clad black
star guards were stationed there
men in blue with noisy pneumatic
equipment weie making unnecess-
ary repairs to the pavement

  barlows men rushed him across
the corridor into a convenient eleva-
tor it dropped them through a
darkened shaft they emerged in a
narrow passage somewhere deep in
the hivelike city walled with plates
of gray-painted steel

  for five minutes they pushed
shane along it until a metal door
stopped them barlow found a key
and unlocked the massive door then
he stopped shane with a wave of his
heavy hand

  still time clayton he said an
easy death if you want to change
your mind just tell me where the
seal is

  shane made his stiff face grin
you might try that safe he said

  get inside barlow jabbed him
with the weapon well try the
safe all right were rid of you
whether we find the seal or not

  a kick sent shane reeling into
the cell

  last chance croaked barlow

  as he thought clayton might have
done shane thumbed his nose the
airtight door closed with a heavy
muffled sound the lock made a
dull click he was alone in the bare
windowless cell dim blue light came
through a small heavy glass plate in
the ceiling

  shane looked around apprehen-
sively

  the metal walls and the metal
floor were bare the only thing
to attract attention was a metal
valve high in the opposite wall that
must be the outside wall of this
dome-city the valve was intended to
let the air out of this death chamber

  barry shane crossed the floor to
examine it it was two feet in
diameter large enough for his body
to pass through if it werent for
those bars over the inside but the
bars seemed strong enough any-
how what would be the use of
getting outside a man would die
as quickly there as in this lethal
chamber

  shane felt weak and ill he sat
down on the cold metal floor and
wiped chill sweat off his face he had
failed that realization was more
painful than the danger to his life
clayton had beaten him after all
merely by keeping silent about the
danger of barlows rivalry and his
own unsuspected possession of the
black star seal

  where was the seal

  squatting on the floor shane be-
gan to wonder what clayton would
have done with the seal it kept
him from thinking about what would
happen when barlow opened the
valve

  since apparently it was the sole
proof of his power and position as
master of the black star party
clayton wasnt likely to have en-
trusted it to anyone else neither
was he apt to leave it in such an
gateway to paradise



obvious place as the safe in his
apartment the logical thing would
be to carry the seal on his person

but shane had searched the out-
sider when he first captured him
there had been only the thin plat-
inum case that contained the pic-
ture of atlantis lee and a few other
trinkets such as the heavy platinum
ring

  absently shane turned the ring
on his finger he was certain too
that the seal couldnt have been hid-
den aboard the friendship unless it
had been cleverly disguised

  he caught his breath and stood up
abruptly with fingers that trembled
a little he slipped oft the massive
ring he remembered claytons
protest against giving it up the
plain platinum bezel was larger than
the star-shaped impression of the
seal

  the idea seemed fantastic bar-
low and his men had evidently been
looking for something larger for
they hadnt given the ring a second
glance but then they had never
seen the seal

  with quivering fingers he twisted
at the bezel it failed to yield shane
gave a bitter laugh after all there
was no use getting excited about it
even if he found the seal it would
be of no use to him now

  under the bezel he found a tiny
stud

  he pressed it the top of the
bezel snapped back it was merely a
platinum cover beneath was re-
vealed a star-shaped jewel it was
black crystal scintillating with tiny
vanishing points of diamond light

  his quivering fingers fumbled in
his pockets and found a scrap of the
gray metal foil when he pressed
it against the coruscating jewel it
came away marked with that in-
imitable striated mark

  he had the black star seal

  with a weary sigh shane snapped
down the metal cover and replaced

the ring on his finger it was of no
use to him now he only hoped that
barlow wouldnt be clever enough to
discover it if they searched his body
he had admired clayton but there
was little to like about barlow

  s-s-s-s-s-s

  shane started and went cold at the
sound of that thin deadly hiss he
saw that the valve-gate was sliding
aside slowly behind the massive
bars the room felt cold and a mist
of condensing moisture swirled like
a ghostly shape under the blue light
the air was going out

  barlow might open the valve slow-
ly to prolong his discomfort that
didnt matter greatly the end would
be the end the black star seal was
no use to him now

  then something happened to the
valve first there was a tapping
then an explosion made a dull muf-
fled thump the air was already
nearly too tenuous to carry sound
the gate was ripped away and
shane saw stars in the dark sky
outside

  whoof

  the air was gone

  shane knew that barlow and his
men hadnt been responsible for
that explosion somebody else had
caused it but he had no time for
riddles he opened his mouth threw
back his head and exhaled swiftly
so that lungs and eardrums might
escape rupture

  only agony was left in his lungs
automatically he tried to breathe
that only increased the pain his
ears hurt a savage force was push-
ing his eyes out of their sockets he
could hardly see

  but he did glimpse the long wreck-
ing bar that had been thrust through
the valve it fell on the floor the
metal quivered under his feet but
his throbbing roaring ears in the
vacuum heard no sound

  somebody was outside somebody
had come to help him that seemed
incredible yet he had no time or

power to think his reeling brain
was too numb

  he picked up the wrecking bar
it was made for such jobs as this
there was a sharp blade of some
hard bright alloy and biting claws
that worked on a fulcrum he set
the blade against the base of one
bar and threw his weight on the
handle

  the blade cut through but his
strength was ebbing his aching
lungs tried to breathe and found no
air a froth of blood and expanding
oxygen strangled him the metal
walls seemed to recede black splot-
ches blotted out his sight

  he worked on blindly he tried
to grin claytons hard grin for no
audience at all he lifted the tool
and brought it down again and once
again

  one bar was out of the way then
another the tool dropped out of his
frozen hands but perhaps the space
was large enough

  he thrust himself into it dimly
he knew that hands had grasped
him with all that was left of his
strength he kicked and squirmed
and pushed

  he slipped through the valve it
came to him with a sense of far
dim wonder that he was outside-
where no naked human animal could
live

xvii

man outside

a hacking cough choked off his
breathe all the pain had gone
there was only wonder left and a
comfort in the nearness of oblivion
he did his best to see but his eyes
were almost past seeing

  there was the terrible black sky
over cruel dead mountains that had
been the bottom of the sea there

was some low sled like machine near
him it must be night for the ma-
chine was not much more than a blot
of shadow there were two bulky
figures in air-suits

  who could they be

  queerly that question lingered in
his ebbing mind even after he had
forgotten the need to breathe but
it was dark or else his eyes had
grown too dim to see he knew that
they were slipping a helmet over his
head lie felt them wrapping him in
the stiff fabric of an air-suit oxygen
hissed into his lungs it seared his
throat and burned like fire in his
lungs but he labored desperately and
painfully to breathe

  then he was in a white bed
through small heavy windows he
could see a rocky landscape glaring
strangely bright under the outsides
ominous sky two or three miles
away he saw the flat gray dome of
new dover he knew he was in one
of the smaller structures outside the
dome-city

  he moved a little and atlantis
lee came silently around the bed a
shaft of sunlight as she passed it
turned her hair to sudden red glory
but her face looked tense and white
and her smile was grave

  feel better she asked her voice
low and musical

  shane tried to speak his throat
felt as if iron hooks had torn it

  dont talk if it hurts she
soothed youll feel better in a few
minutes dr wolf just looked you
over theres nothing wrong that a
little rest wont fix

  he managed a faint painful whis-
per

  didnt know a man-could live
-outside

 the combined oxygen in the
blood is enough to keep life going
for several minutes the main dan-
ger was rupture of the lungs or blood
vessels dr wolf says you didnt
suffer anything serious his tense
smile reflected her admiration cut-
gateway to paradise



ting those bars must have taken
courage and strength

  thanks he whispered it was
you who got me out

  with the help of some friends
  how did you know-

a talking cough choked off his
question and his throat burned
with intense misery again

  dr wolf left this for you she
held a glassof something to his lips
it had a sharp biting taste but im-
mediately he felt better we had a
friend in touch with barlows plot
he learned about the warrant for
my arrest and your refusal to sign
it we had planned the escape be-
forehand in case one of us went to
the vacuum cell

  us whispered shane

  theres just a handful of us
she said all thats left of the old
democratic opposition to the black
star weve kept together a little
underground organization hoping
somehow to prevent the destruction
of the barrier and bring peace be-
tween america and new britain
where are we shane inquired
looking across the dead miles to
new dover

  lee observatory she said her
eyes watchful

  thanks beautiful shane re-
membered that he was glenn clay-
ton and tried to grin his throat
felt slightly better nice of you
to help an old enemy

  dont be an idiot she came
close to the bed and her worried
violet eyes looked down at him if
you feel able to talk tell me who you
are

  shane tried not to look astonished
could you forget me darling
i havent forgotten clayton
her voice seemed to indicate that
she wished she could you look the
part-almost-but you just dont
know the lines youve made half a
dozen blunders the worst one was
getting caught by barlow clayton

had been watching barlow set his
trap for two years planning to
catch barlow himself in it when-
ever it wras sprung she glanced
at the window and clayton
wouldnt have asked where we are
all right shane yielded but
claytons green-eyed grin seemed
natural now im barry shane
american we caught clayton be-
fore he could smash the barrier i
came out in his place

  that was foolish her grave
eyes smiled again but i like you
for it

  shane watched her face

  dont you want to know what
happened to him he had to catch
his breath before he could go on
it was i who captured him when
i left he was awaiting execution for
attempted escape

  for a long period she looked past
him then her red head shook
slightly

  it would have mattered once
she said softly but things have
changed

   shane felt relieved

  im glad he told her huskily
i was afraid you would hold me
responsible for his death you see
he was carrying your picture

  you thought that-and still you
told me her white face smiled i
think youre all right barry shane
glenn wanted me to marry him i
might have done it once if he hadnt
insisted that i must join the black
star and abandon our little opposi-
tion party

  im glad you didnt you knew
he was the leader of the black
star

  she nodded he told me when he
asked me to marry him in fact a
good many people knew besides bar-
low and his gang clayton had a few
trusted subordinates its impossible
to keep such information really
secret somebody must know where
the black stars orders come from
shane sat up in the bed


wonder story annual

  whats the situation now he
asked barlow will be desperate
when he finds out i was rescued
now that he has shown his hand he
knows hell have to win or die can
he find me here

  anxiously he watched her face
probably she answered most
of the opposition to the black star
exists among our scientists and en-
gineers the observatory has been a
headquarters for our small group
barlow and his henchmen will know
where to look a rocket took off
from the city before sunrise its
probably barlows avenger
shane looked out again across the
dead harshly-lit miles to new bri-
tain

  what about weapons and de-
fenses he pursued if barlows
ship should attack or his men on
the ground have we weapons to
hold them off

sadly atlantis shook her head
there are two dozen men of our
group here at the observatory now
-astronomers engineers and mem-
bers of the league council dr wins-
ton called them in a secret meeting
here to inform them about a recent
discovery of his

  her white face looked grave as
she mentioned the doctors dis-
covery

  but we have no weapons she
went on we cant hold out against
the black star the extremist ele-
ment of the party has been wanting
for years to wipe us out clayton
restrained them only i think be-
cause of his old friendship for me
that was one of the arguments
barlow used in getting recruits for
his plot

  she shrugged unhappily yet her
lovely red lips did not tremble

  i dont see what we can do she
concluded barlow and his extre-
mists will doubtless order an attack
on us at once admiral gluck can
destroy the observatory and all of

us with one rocket load of bombs
admiral gluck- shane re-
peated is he in on the plot

  i dont think so our friends in
the black star party are certain he
knew nothing about it he is loyal
to the party if orders come to him
stamped with the black star seal
he will obey them without question
barlow will order him to attack
the observatory and he will do so
promptly

  shane grinned he caught the
girls arms pulled her to him and
set a kiss on her startled face his
triumphant whoop was checked by
the pain in his raw throat

  then were all right beautiful
he croaked breathlessly he liked
that word of claytons-for atlantis
lee well just send an order to
admiral gluck-and have barlow
and his gang taken care of for the
traitors they are

  he slipped the massive ring off his
finger pressed the tiny stud to un-
cover the black scintillating star-
shaped jewel he waved it under her
eyes

   there it is ive still got the seal
her violet eyes failed to light with
his own elation her white face
smiled a little but it still seemed
tense with dread the shadow of
fear was still dark in her eyes

  whats the matter he asked
do you think barlow will attack be-
fore we have time to send an order
to admiral gluck

  thats possible she admitted
barlow and his men must be des-
perate they will do everything they
can without any delay we might
be betrayed by others in the plot
that we dont know of but theres
something else something much
more serious

  shane caught his breath

  i thought there must be some-
thing he whispered you look so
pale and anxious he caught her
hand and found it cold tell me
whats wrong
gateway to paradise



  her red head turned away

  if you feel able to stand some
dreadful news she said i told you
dr winston had made an important
discovery i called our group to-
gether to hear about it he is going
to make his announcement in a few
minutes

  what is it asked shane

  ill let dr winston tell you
her voice was hushed and ominous
when youve heard it the black
star and captain barlows plots
wont matter veiy much

xviii
mad moon

shane was rapidly recovering
from his ordeal outside atlantis
lee wanted to take his arm but he
walked without her aid into the
small lecture room where two dozen
scientists and engineers-the chief
opposition of the black star-were
waiting for dr winstons portent-
ous announcement

  altantis introduced him before
they sat down

  this is captain clayton just
back from america

  quick hostility flashed on several
faces

  we dont want a back star
leader here a spectacled man said
angrily

  captain claytons viewpoint
changed after his recent visit inside
the barrier the girl said he is
now a friend of america and one of
us

  thats right shane added in his
hoarse painful voice im going to
try to use my power in the black
star to prevent any attack on
america or on any of you but i
have enemies in the black star miss
lee has just saved my life there
will be trouble

  a bearded man shook his head
you dont know how much trou-
ble clayton until you have listened
to dr winston

  an ominous expectant silence
settled over the room as a tall gray-
faced man came through a door be-
hind the speakers platform he
looked over the room with troubled
preoccupied eyes

 dr winston atlantis lee
breathed

  the tall man cleared his throat
and his pale nervous hands took
metal foil documents out of a brief-
case in a low grave voice he began
simply	

  thank you for coming here a
few of you have received some hints
about this discovery but i waited
before making any formal announce-
ment until two of my associates had
checked my work the check has
just been completed there is no
escape from the truth

  a breathless stir swept the room
somebody made a little stifled out-
cry one man rose and stalked out
silently white-faced

  go on shane whispered hoarse-
ly

  a few days ago resumed the
tall astronomer our larger tele-
scope picked up a new object in the
southern sky-almost in the same
position where the passing dwarf
vanished two hundred years ago
after it had stripped off the air and
the seas of earth on observation
it proved to be no ordinary comet
it is a solid object of almost plane-
tary size

  although the astronomers of the
time had stated that the return of
the dwarf was impossible we sup-
posed for a time that their observa-
tions had been in error we thought
that the dwarf was coming back
that is the report that some of you
have heard it was very alarming
because the object is heading direct-
ly toward an intersection of the
earths orbit
	wonder story annual

  it will reach the point of inter-
section at exactly the same time
earth does that means collision
last night studying the object i
made another discovery apparently
the observations of the old astrono-
mers were correct after all the
approaching body is not the dwarf

excitement swept the little
room again half the men were
on their feet shane swayed upright
leaning on the desk in front of him

  then what is it somebody
shouted was it all a mistake about
the collision

  the lean astronomer put out his
hand and breathless silence fell

  it isnt the dwarf his low voice
repeated its the moon the earths
old satellite which followed the
dwarf into space evidently it was
drawn into a very long cometary
orbit but it escaped the dwarfs
attraction in the end it is still a
part of the solar system now after
two hundred years it is coming back
to perihelion

  what about the collision shane
rasped

  that doesnt alter our other ob-
servations winston said the
moon is moving toward collision
with the earth it isnt as heavy as
the dwarf of course but that will
make no difference to earth the
impact will destroy everything alive
-inside the barrier or outside
how much time have we
here are my figures winstons
gray nervous hand held up a sheaf
of pages you may go over them if
you like they indicate that the col-
lision will take place in twenty-two
days

  most oi the men in the room sat
motionless in stunned silence one
kept repeating that last phrase un-
der his breath

  twenty-two days   twenty-two
days

  one made aimless scrawls on a
metal foil sheet another rose and

bolted through the door as if the
little room had suddenly become a
deadly trap

  shane went swaying down the
aisle to the table where winston
stood he waved aside the metal foil
documents his painful voice rasped
the question what are you going to
do about it

  the spare astronomer shook his
gray-streaked head

  what can we do his lean
shoulders shrugged if we had
years of time it might have been
possible to outfit expeditions to colo-
nize mars or venus our rockets
have never reached such distances
but now theres no time for any-
thing not even that

  other men came up with ques-
tions shane took the sheets of gray
foil and began to thumb through
them

  beside him atlantis lee spoke
softly

  dr winston is our best scientist
when he gives up it means that we
are beaten new britain cant do
anything to avert this disaster her
voice dropped to an urgent whisper
barry shane can america help

barry looked up from the gray
metal sheets stared into her
troubled violet eyes

  im sure america could do noth-
ing alone he said hoarsely but i
was just wondering-

  with brow furrowed he looked
again at winstons calculations
softly the girl prompted him
wondering what barry

  new britain can do nothing he
said im sure america couldnt for
want of power and industrial organi-
zation but i was wondering what
we could both do together

  her eyes lit with eagerness you
have a plan

  not a plan yet he glanced at
the gray sheets again tell me
could one of your rockets go out to
meet the moon say at a distance of
gateway to paradise



a few million miles

   suppose so her tense fingers
caught his arms tell me barry
have you found a way 

  i dont know he whispered
let me ask a question his husky
voice called to lean dr winston
suppose that the moon could be cut
off from all gravitational forces for
the last few million miles of its ap-
proach what would be the result
the astronomers thin face grew
sardonic

  if it could he repeated with un-
hidden irony

  please dr winston atlantis
lee said urgently this is serious
winston looked keenly at shane
nobody can cut off gravitational
forces he said but if you want a
serious reply to a fantastic question
of course the curve of the moons
orbit would straighten it would no
longer be drawn toward the sun
consequently it would pass outside
the earths orbit

  how far outside demanded
shane

  that depends on how long you
imagine it to be cut off

  suppose it would be done in ten
days would the collision be
averted 

  impatiently winston scrawled
symbols on his metal sheets

  by a narrow margin it would
suddenly he moved toward shane
and his gray eyes were piercingly
intent tn a new breathless voice
he blurted

  is there a way to cut off gravity 
it might be done said barry
shane if america and the outside
work together

  at that moment a lean freckled
youth with tangled red hair came
running into the room he was
breathing fast and he looked excited

  thats tony atlantis lee told
shane my brother hes the one
who helped me get you out of the
vacuum cell he has been on watch
in the communications turret above

in case barlow tried anything she
called what is it tony

  the panting boy thrust a trem-
bling scrap of metal foil into her
hands

  a radio message he gasped
picked it up two hours ago just
before sunrise didnt know it was
important till i got it decoded read
it lan

  the girls clear voice read aloud
urgent and confidential captain
barlow patrol rocket avenger to
admiral gluck war rocket nemesis
open rebellion against black star
revolt headed by atlantis lee head-
quarters in lee observatory dr
winston spreading unrest with prop-
aganda rumors of danger from
space rebels have been joined by
man claiming to be captain glenn
clayton have evidence this man is
impostor and traitor to black star
he does not possess black star seal
as previously rumored i urge imme-
diate attack on observatory before
rebels can undermine black star
authority with propaganda lies of
approaching cataclysm

  shane felt cold and weak as if the
stark chill of the outside were still
in his blood this was a cleverer
blow than he had expected his
clammy hands clutched the edge of
the battered lecture table it was
hard to think of anything to do

  can you take me to the radio
he asked i want to talk to admiral
gluck

  he knew he had to communicate
with gluck but it was hard to think
of what to say

  sure captain tony lees blue
eyes were shining he seemed com-
pletely unafraid we can try but
the sun is up now and radio wont
reach very far barlows message
came just in time to reach the relay
stations now the solar interference
has shut down

  we must try shane insisted

  he followed the boy up a circular
metal stairway into the communica-
	wonder story annual

tions turret evidently this was
tony lees domain for the metal
walls wrere decorated with model
rockets observation ports looked
out in every direction upon dead
black mountains that had never seen
the sun until the dwarf came upon
the gray disk of new dover and the
smaller domes around it

  confidently the boy twisted the
dials

  lee observatory calling rocket
nemesis he chanted into the micro-
phone captain glenn clayton
calling admiral gluck-

  his breathless voice broke off as
the floor pitched and jerked shat-
tering glass crashed somewhere a
great mushroom of white vapor
grew up beside the observatory

  black fragments of rock hurtled
out of it debris rang against the
observatory dome

  the boys eyes were still shining
and he didnt seem afraid he knew
that his world had only days to live
death clanged and rattled incessant-
ly against the metal dome yet his
voice was low and calm

  that was a rocket-bomb cap-
tain the fleet must be above us now
but maybe they cant hear the sun
plays queer tricks with radio

ring around the world

the hail of bomb splinters and
rocky debris ceased in the nar-
row little communications turret
above the observatory dome barry
shane turned to atlantis lees red-
haired brother

  try again tony get me the
admiral

  excited but unafraid the boy
went back to his dials

  lee observatory he calmly re-
sumed his chant calling rocket

nemesis captain glenn clayton
calling admiral gluck-

 barry shane watched the dark
sky a glance toward the low sun
dazzled him he couldnt find the
rocket fleet admiral glucks shrill
voice startled him

  hello clayton it rose and fell
on a sea of hissing static will you
surrender the observatory and sub-
mit to a party trial on the charges of
treason that have been made against
you or do you want another and
bigger bomb

 shane swallowed to clear his
husky throat

  i refuse to surrender he rapped
in claytons hard tones i am not a
traitor the real traitors are bar-
low and his henchmen i have let
them show their hand

  upon the roaring static glucks
sharp voice seemed uncertain

  can you explain your dealings
with the enemies of the black star
i can explain whatever i like
shane tried to speak curtly like the
black star leader send a ship to
pick up a confidential message it
will be stamped with the black star
seal

  on the rushing static glucks thin
voice audibly faltered

  the seal but barlow informed
me- a ship will be sent at once
sir

  atlantis lee helped him compose
the message and typed it on a sheet
of gray metal foil shane stamped it
with the scintillating crystal star in
claytons ring

   a grave emergency exists the at-
  tack on the barrier must be aban-
  doned the fleet and all the resources
  of the black star will be placed at
  capt claytons disposal for the task of
  averting disaster with your own
  telescopes you can confirm dr wins-
  tons discovery that the moon is com-
  ing back toward collision with earth
  when you have done that come with
  your staff to the lee observatory

  a gray war rocket dropped on an
angular landing stanchion at the
gateway to paradise



edge of the new bomb crater beside
the observatory tony lee wearing
an air-suit and waving a black flag
carried the message to its valve

  a long hour passed shane talked
a little to atlantis lee she was as
unfrightened as her brother shane
suddenly knew that he loved her but
it was impossible to speak of love
when the shadow of disaster hung
over earth

two rockets dropped beside the
observatory - glucks nemesis
and barlows avenger a dozen men
came through the air-lock into the
observatory shane met them the
fierce yellow-mustached little ad-
miral was tense and suspicious bar-
lows sullen face looked uneasy de-
fiant

  you check dr winstons discov-
ery asked shane

  there is a strange object in the
south glucks small shrewd eyes
were piercing but your behavior
has been suspicious clayton grave
charges have been made against you
i am here only because i must obey
the commands of the black star
dr winston is waiting in the lec-
ture room shane told him i want
you to listen to him check his work
all you like convince yourselves
that the danger is real then well
talk about what to do

  scowling ferociously barlow
pointed a thick finger at shane
admiral dont trust this man this
looks like a trap are you going to
walk into it this mans dealings
with the known enemies of the black
star are obvious treason why dont
you arrest him

  the little admiral did not take his
probing eyes off shane

  the black star he repeated
commanded me to come here
barlow stepped forward one
hairy hand trembling near the gun
at his hip his broad face held a
look of leering triumph

  admiral look at this man his

thin voice rasped is he captain
clayton is he our real leader i
have evidence that he is not when
he came back from america he
didnt even know where clayton
lived in new dover 

  a blunt finger jabbed

  look at him you can see hes
a different man his hair is a little
too dark and hes a little too small
see claytons clothing doesnt quite
fit look- barlow stepped closer
his voice grew harsh with excite-
ment look at the scars on his face
i hadnt noticed them before but
they are the scars of plastic sur-
gery he drew his gun as he fin-
ished triumphantly this man is
just a copy of clayton

  shane grinned claytons hard
grin

  better put up your gun he ad-
vised barlow he turned to gluck
admiral i want you to listen to dr
winston then i have something to
tell you

  wait admiral yelped barlow
are you going to allow this im-
postor-

 the black stars command
gluck shrilled put up your gun
barlow

  an hour later when they came
out of winstons lecture room the
little admiral and his staff looked
shaken and pale even barlow ap-
peared subdued and his pale thick
lips kept moving

  twenty-two days he whispered
only twenty-two days

  with claytons hard voice shane
rapped at gluck

  admiral are you convinced of
the danger

  the stern little man tugged fierce-
ly at his yellow mustache

  i am convinced his thin voice
was husky and quavering i have
checked everything it i more than
a danger it is a sentence of doom
medals tinkled as he shrugged hope-
lessly what were you going to tell
me captain what can the black


wonder story annual

star do 

  the black star can do nothing
alone shane said gravely but i
believe that all of us working to-
gether have a chance with a hard
grin at barlow he confessed its
true that im not captain clayton
the shaken men merely stared at
him

  im barry shane an american
before the officers startled gaze he
slipped clayton ring from his fin-
ger and snapped open the bezel to
show the glittering star-shaped crys-
tal barlow made a gasping sound
as if of rage and pain grinning at
him shane gave the ring to gluck

  the black star seal he told the
astonished admiral i dont need it
any longer will you keep it in trust
for the party

astern pride lit glucks thin
old face the suspicion vanished
from his shrewd eyes he put the
ring on a gnarled finger of his right
hand and looked dazedly at shane

  you are an american he qua-
vered hopefully you know the sci-
ence that created the barrier he
paused and his keen eyes probed
shanes do you know how to stop
the moon

  it cant be stopped shane ad-
mitted without hesitation but
there is a way to turn it a little
aside-if we can get there with the
necessary equipment in time
how demanded the admiral
if sufficient power is used
shane explained the space-warp
wall created by an ultra-electronic
tube can be made opaque to gravita-
tion we must set up a new barrier
around tie moon to cut it off from
the suns gravitation that will
change its path enough if we can
do it in time to make it miss the
earth

  but we have no barrier tube
objected gluck

  theres a spare tube in america
in the ring cylinder shane told

him remember the war is over
it will take the united efforts of all
of us to avert destruction the
americans couldnt do anything
alone they havent the ships to
reach the moon or the gold-film cells
to supply the tremendous power that
will be required but america can
supply the tube

  admiral gluck tugged doubtfully
at his yellow mustache he wasnt
used to the idea of america as an
ally

  two days later the nemesis landed
at ring city shane introduced the
little admiral to general whitehall
the bulky crates that contained the
parts of the spare ultradyne tube
were loaded without delay

  the tube wasnt designed for a
gravitational shield whitehall
warned shane you will have to
overload it about a hundred times i
dont know how long it will hold out
-perhaps a few minutes perhaps
long enough if we only had time to
build another-

  but there was no time

  the nemesiss flashed out through
the ring again to overtake the rocket
fleet already bound for the moon
loaded with gold-film cells after six
days the fleet reached the returning
satellite the long cylinders dropped
to form a ring on the cragged floor
of the vast ice-crater

with a crew of men in air-suits
barry shane assembled the tube
in the center of that ring the six-
armed tube was shaped somewhat
like one of the pick-up toys called
jacks that young girls still played
with but it rose seventy feet high
hung in a steel tower thick cables
connected it to the power rooms of
the rockets ringed about it

  at last after sixty sleepless hours
the job was finished reeling with
weariness shane gave a signal a
river of power came through the
cables from the ships the trans-
parent quartz arms of the great tube
gateway to paradise



glowed faintly green

  over the cragged ice-peaks of the
wild moonscape the dark splendor
of space appeared unchanged the
earth was like another strange
moon-brown and bare except for
the sharp-edged greenish circle of
america inside the ring not even
a flicker passed across that dark
strange sky

  presently a signal came from the
navigation room of the nemesis
the moon had ceased its slow curve
toward the sun-and toward colli-
sion with earth the tube worked

  but would it burn out

  weary as he was shane couldnt
take his eyes off that pale green glow
in the great arms that now meant
the ehance of the wrorld to survive
it remained steady for minute after
minute hour after hour until shane
went to sleep on his feet

  anxious days went by the brown
barren earth grew vaster in the
heavens and still the overloaded
tube endured the moon reached the
point of closest approach the deso-
late earth filled the lunar sky in a
few more hours the moon would
have been safely past

  but the reaction of earths gravi-
tational stresses increased the over-
load the tube flickered and went
dark the invisible gravity wall was
gone the terrific power of gravita-
tion reached the passing satellite and
shattered it cataclysmic moon-
quakes tossed the ice-plain where
the rocket fleet had landed the dead
tube was swallowed in a new cre-
vasse

  the rockets fled from the doomed
satellite through space already dan-
gerous with flying ice

  aboard the nemesis barry shane
watched that displav of cosmic fury
his heart cold with ipprehension for
the safety of violet-eyed atlantis
lee back in new dover what would
happen to the dome-city under the
fragments of the shattered ice-
world 

  even in his concern he realized
that the spectacle had an awesome
beauty the moons cragged face
melted into white chaos two long
plumes of white reached out slowly
as the hours passed they stretched
into a white and shining double ring
about the dead brown earth the
moons rocky core hurtled onward
into space

  finally then the hail of ice frag-
ments reached the naked brown
earth the heat of impact turned
them into expanding steam the
barren planet was splotched with
white the splotches grew and ran
together until the planets face was
veiled in white

  only the misty greenish circle
over north america remained un-
changed under the shelter of the
ring america had escaped all harm
but white clouds hid the fate of the
cities of new britain in the unpro-
tected exposed outside

  despairing for atlantis lees life
barry shane found it difficult to live
up to the hard cynical grin he had
so willingly assumed

gateway to paradise

 man and a woman alone in a
broken machine on the dead dry
skeleton-strewn waste where once
the sea had been waited for the end
of the world under the skillful care
of della rand clayton recovered
from the effects of the bullet she had
fired he continued his observations
of the approaching object in the
southern sky and found it was not
the returning dwarf

  it was earths old lost moon but
that fact seemed to make no differ-
ence night by night the returning
satellite loomed larger and larger
and more ominous in the circular


wonder story annual

screen of the powerful electronic
telescope clayton also watched the
sky for the ion-glow of any passing
rocket

  im going to signal a ship he
told della whenever one comes in
sight the ships lights should at-
tract attention if we open all the
shutters and wink them

  dellas gaze was searching al-
most hostile

  why she demanded her voice
cold with scorn do you want to go
back to rejoin your friends in the
black star do you want to expose
barry shane and start a new attack
on the ring

  clayton laughed and put his arm
around her

  are you trying to start a fight
beautiful

  i wont let you go back if thats
what you want to do

  forgive me darling he said
his face grave and oddly tender i
dont blame you for thinking that
about me ive given you cause
enough but things are different
now beautiful youve made them
different

  wonderingly she scrutinized his
features he smiled back at her-a
little smile that seemed strangely
abashed and diffident the hard
reckless glint in his green eyes had
vanished grown soft

  she waited bewilderedly silent in
his arms

  i remember something i read in
an old book he said slowly one of
the few books that were saved after
the dwarf passed it said something
about the gateway to paradise we
in the black star have been knock-
ing on thewrong gate youve helped
me find the right one beatuiful
his arms drew her closer and he
kissed her gently

  i want to go back and help barry
shane he continued the trap was
waiting for him i knew that barlow
had already set it it was amusing
to let shane walk into it-amusing

then because you hadnt shown me
the proper gate i suppose it wont
make any difference in the end but
id like to do what i can to repair
a little of the harm ive done
besides-

  he laughed and the old hard
glint came back into his eyes

  besides he repeated if cap-
tain barlow has already sprung his
trap id like to see him face to face
with the ghost of the man he mur-
dered 

 i wonder - have you really
changed whispered della rand

  they watched the dark skies for
a rockets passing glare but mo ship
passed slow disappointment grew
upon claytons face

  there seem to be no patrol flights
any more he said at last gluck
must have moved the fleet from
point fourteen he grinned at her
i guess well see the end together
after all beautiful

  im glad she whispered in his
arms

  night by night they watched the
moon

  growing on the telescope screen
it showed a face that earth had
never seen before but the other
side of the moon was only another
crater-pitted wilderness of jagged
glaring ice

  just another snowball beauti-
ful

  clayton grinned at della rand
and his hard green eyes seemed un-
afraid

  how is that she breathed

  thats all the old explorers found
two hundred years ago he ad-
justed the instrument and the
moons cruel white features grew
upon the screen just a hard snow-
ball molded on a core of rock a
cosmic prank on the human race

a day came when the telescope
was no longer necessary the
terrible moon grew larger than the
sun its savage ice-mountains were
gateway to paradise	

visible to the unaided eye della
rand thought they were like the
spikes in some ancient war-club
glimpsed by a victim as the weapon
descended

  dread created numbness in her
brain she tried to find small tasks
about their cramped quarters in the
disabled friendship to occupy her
mind but all the business of life had
lost its meaning now she was glad
to be with clayton yet all her love
seemed always to turn into fear of
the moment when he would be gone
with all the doomed world she
looked up dully as he came into the
galley

  his brown face looked perplexed
for once he seemed too disturbed
to grin

  i said it was all a joke now the
moon is playing another prank it
has left its orbit

  her dark eyes went black star-
ing at him her strong slender hands
caught suddenly at her throat the
pang of hope was more painful than
despair had been

  what do you mean she gasped

  clayton recovered his grin

  the moon isnt following quite
the orbit i predicted he told her
though the difference isnt great
an error i suppose in my calcula-
tions i cant figure it out i checked
them a dozen times

  will it miss us she whispered
anxiously

  he shrugged too soon to say
beautiful not much at the best
just a graze perhaps instead of the
center shot i predicted probably not
enough to make any difference his
hard fingers caught her trembling
arm and she found comfort in his
strength want to have a look

  hour by hour the moon expanded
until it blotted out the stars its
rays flooded the dead sea-floor with
a cold strange radiance its awe-
some mountainous disk became the
only reality

  della rand tried not to look at it

again and again she left the ports
to begin some useless task of sweep-
ing-setting their quarters in order
but always the appalling spectacle
drew her back unwillingly

  clayton seemed scarcely dis-
turbed he grinned at her visible ap-
prehension sometimes it seemed to
her that he felt a strange elation on
this terrifying spectacle of cosmic
catastrophe

  she fixed a tray of food in the
little galley and brought it to him
but of course neither of them could
eat he finished a new set of observa-
tions and his calm brown fingers
solved one more problem on the
calculator

  what- della gulped what
have you found

  things are going to be interest-
ing beautiful his green eyes held
the old reckless glint its going to
miss us but not by very much its
going to pass inside the critical dis-
tance of four radii

  what does that mean

  your guess is as good as mine
he replied theory says the moon
should be broken up by tidal stresses
inside the critical distance the
rocky core might go on past but i
imagine most of the ice will be
peeled off it i think were going
to have a hail-storm beautiful-a
hail-storm like none there ever was
before he swept her into his hard
arms and kissed her whatever
happens things are going to be
interesting

  they watched the end of a world

huge beyond imagination cruel
with mountain-fangs of glaring
ice the moon filled the southward
sky the battle of cosmic energies
made a spectacle such as man had
never seen della felt numb and ill
with dread but claytons greenish
eyes were bright and his hard brown
face had a faint eager smile

  ice-crags shattered on the moon
tidal strains ripped new black fis-

surcs across the craters wider and
longer than the snow-filled cracks
that once had spread their mysteri-
ous web from the meteor-shattered
crater named tycho

  the moon dissolved into white
chaos the stricken satellite shud-
dered and spun gleaming plumes of
debris were flung across the skys
black face yet the cataclysm had the
stately deliberation fitting to a plan-
ets death

  it was like a picture in slow mo-
tion time was suspended eyes
ached and necks were cramped and
still the watchers dared not look
away for no man had ever seen the
death of a world

  they had lost track of time hours
must have passed the rays of the
rising sun picked out the first jagged
fragment of the shattered world fall-
ing near them clayton pointed and
caught dellas cold hand

  they watched silently the
cragged missile struck a distant line
of dead brown hills the dry ocean-
bed rocked to the impact dellas
forgotten tray of dishes fell and
shattered on the floor steam ex-
ploded from the point of impact
white vapor filled the sky and veiled
the crumbling moon

  now what will happen dellas
cold hand was tense in claytons
to the earth her dark eyes
searched his face anxiously and to-
ils 

  too soon to say beautiful well
have to wait and see

it was two days before the ice-
battered fleet could return to the
white-ringed earth by that time
the clouds had begun to clear from
the lake-jeweled uplands still a soft
haze veiled the brown mountains
that had been so stark and bare

  thats more than water-vapor
shane told admiral gluck the
moon must have caught a part of
our lost air as it was drawn between
earth and the dwarf just a frac-

tion of course but it might be fairly
dense in the old sea-bottoms

  the watch-officer of the nemesis
caught a flashing signal light drop-
ping to investigate the rocket found
the jagged brown hull of the dis-
guised friendship lying on the shore
of a new shallow sea

  della rand and clayton came run-
ning hand in hand to greet their
rescuers they were breathing fast
in the thin air but they needed no
air-suits

  clayton met shane with a hard
green-eyed grin

  congratulations captain clay-
ton clayton said good work you
can keep the name if you like i have
something else he looked at the
dark-eyed girl and the hardness
went out of his grin weve found
something else he repeated softly
i have found a gateway and della
has found a dream

  shane grinned back

  im not using the name thanks
anyhow

  two hours later the rocket
dropped through the thinning white
ceiling over new dover now the
gray dome-city stood upon the end
of a long rugged headland a new
sea washed the black cliffs beneath
it

  the nemesis landed upon the level
top of the dome the city was un-
harmed for the returning atmos-
phere had cushioned earth from the
hail of icy debris a cheering crowd
surrounded the battered rocket
shane glimpsed the bare red head of
atlantis lee and he went to find her

  barry she called to him

  the sky had cleared and across it
soared the white eternal arch of the
ring around the earth it was mans
own arch of victory in a battle with
the cosmos

  see barry atlantis lee turned
gently in shanes hard arms and
pointed to the soaring pillars of the
double ring arent they like a
splendid gateway

cally he dipped into the huge crate
at his side and took out the first
roll of red-and-green crepe paper

  what sudden burst of sentiment
had inspired the ganymedan prod-
ucts corporation inc to ship a com-
plete collection of christmas decora-
tions to the dome he did not pause
to inquire olafs was a placid dis-
position and in his self-imposed job
as chief christmas decorator he was
content with his lot

  he frowned suddenly and mut-
tered a curse the generals assem-
bly signal light was flashing on and
off hysterically with an injured air
olaf laid down the tack-hammer he
had just lifted then the roll of crepe
paper picked some tinsel out of his
hair and left for officers quarters

  commander scott pelham was in
his deep armchair at the head of the
table when olaf entered his stubby
fingers were drumming unrhythm-
ically upon the glass-topped table
olaf met the commanders furious
eyes without fear for nothing had
gone wrong in his department in
twenty ganymedan revolutions

  the room filled rapidly with men
and pelhams eyes hardened as he
counted noses in one sweeping
glance

  were allhere men we face a
crisis

  there was a vague stir olafs eyes
sought the ceiling and he relaxed
crises hit the dome once a revolu-
tion on the average usually they
turned out to be a sudden rise in
the quota of exite to be gathered or
the inferior quality of the last batch
of karen leaves he stiffened how-
ever at the next words

  in connection with the crisis i
have one question to ask pelhams
voice was a deep baritone and it
rasped unpleasantly when he was
angry what dirty imbecile trou-
ble-maker has been telling those
blasted ossies fairy tales

  olaf cleared his throat nervously
and thus immediately became the

center of attention his adams ap-
ple wobbled in sudden alarm and his
forehead wrinkled into a washboard
he shivered

  i-i- he stuttered quickly fell
silent his long fingers made a jbewil-
dered gesture of appeal i mean i
was out there yesterday after the
last-uh-supplies of karen leaves
on account the ossies were slow
and-

  a deceptive sweetness entered
pelhams voice he smiled

  did you tell those natives about
santa claus olaf

the smile looked uncommonly like
a wolfish leer and olaf broke
down he nodded convulsively

  oh you did well well you told
them about santa claus he comes
down in a sleigh that flies through
the air with eight reindeer pulling
it huh

 well-er-doesnt he olaf
asked unhappily

  and you drew pictures of the
reindeer just to make sure there was
no mistake also he has a long white
beard and red clothes with white
trimmings

  yeah thats right said olaf
his face puzzled

  and he has a big bag chock full
of presents for good little boys and
girls and he brings it- down the
chimney and puts presents inside
stockings

  sure

  you also told them hes about
due didnt you one more revolu-
tion and hes going to visit us 

  olaf smiled weakly yeah com-
mander i meant to tell you im fix-
ing up the tree and-

  shut up the commander was
breathing hard in a whistling sort
of way do you know what those
ossies have thought of

  no commander

  pelham leaned across the table
toward olaf and shouted they
want santa claus to visit them
christmas on ganymede



  someone laughed and changed it
quickly into a strangling cough at
the commanders raging stare

  and if santa claus doesnt visit
them the ossies are going to quit
work he repeated quit cold-
strike

  there was no laughter strangled
or otherwise after that if there was
more than one thought among the
entire group it didnt show itself
olaf expressed that thought

  but what about the quota
well what about it snarled
pelham do i have to draw pictures
for you oandvmedan products has
to get one hundred tons of wolfram-
mite eighty tons of karen leaves
and fifty tons of oxite every year
or it loses its franchise i suppose
there isnt anyone here who doesnt
know that it so happens that the
current year ends in two ganyme-
dan revolutions and were five per
cent behind schedule as it is

  there was horrified silence

  and now the ossies wont work
unless they get santa claus no
work no quota no franchise-no
jobs get that you low-grade mor-
ons when the company loses its
franchise we lose the best-paying
jobs in the system kiss them good-
by men unless-

he paused glared steadily at
olaf and added

  unless by next revolution we
have a flying sleigh eight reindeer
and a santa claus and by every
cosmic speck in the rings of saturn
were going to have just that espe-
cially a santa

  ten faces turned ghastly pale
got anybody in mind comman-
der  asked someone in a voice that
was three-quarters croak

yes as a matter of fact ihave
he sprawled back in his chair
olaf johnson broke into a sudden
sweat as he found himself staring at
the end of a pointing forefinger
aw commander he quavered

  but the pointing finger never
moved

pelham tramped into the fore-
room removed his oxygen nose-
piece and the cold cylinders attached
to it one by one he cast off thick
woolen outer garments and with a
final weary sigh jerked off a pair of
heavy knee-high space boots

  sim pierce paused in his careful
inspection of the latest batch of
karen leaves and cast a hopeful
glance over his spectacles

  well he asked

  pelham shrugged i promised
them santa what else could i do
i also doubled sugar rations so
theyre back on the job-for the mo-
ment

  you mean till the santa we
promised doesnt show up pierce
straightened and waved a long karen
leaf at the commanders face for
emphasis this is the silliest thing
i ever heard of it cant be done
there aint no santa claus

  try telling that to the ossies
pelham slumped into a chair and his
expression became stonily bleak
whats benson doing

  you mean that flying sleigh he
says he can rig up pierce held a
leaf up to the light and peered at it
critically hes a crackpot if you
ask me the old buzzard went down
to the sub-level this morning and
hes been there ever since all i
know is that hes taken the spare
lectro-dissociator apart if anything
happens to the regular it just means
that were without oxygen

  well pelham rose heavily for
my part i hope we do choke it would
be an easy way out of this whole
mess im going down below

  he stumped out and slammed the
door behind him

  in the sub-level he gazed about in
bewilderment for the room was lit-
tered with gleaming chrome-steel
machine parts it took him some
time to recognize the mess as the


wonder story annual

remains of what had been a com-
pact snugly built lectro-dissociator
the day before in the center in
anachronistic contract stood a dusty
wooden sleigh atop rusted runners
from beneath it came the sound of
hammering

  hey benton called pelham

  a grimy sweat-streaked face
pushed out from underneath the
sleigh and a stream of tobacco juice
shot toward bensons ever-present
cuspidor

  what are you shouting like that
for he complained this is deli-
cate work

  what the devil is that weird con-
traption demanded pelham

  flying sleigh my own idea too
the light of enthusiasm shone in
bensons watery eyes and the quid
in his mouth shifted from cheek to
cheek as he spoke the sleigh was
brought here in the old days when
they thought ganymede was cov-
ered with snow like the other jovian
moons all i have to do is fix a few
gravo-repulsors from the dissociator
to the bottom and thatll make it
weightless when the currents on
compressed air-jets will do the rest

  the commander chewed his lower
lip dubiously

  will it work

  sure it will lots of people have
thought of using repulsors in air
travel but theyre inefficient espe-
cially in heavy gravity fields here
on ganymede with a field of one-
third gravity and a thin atmosphere
a child could run it even johnson
could run it though i wouldnt
mourn if he fell off and broke his
blasted neck

  all right then look here weve
got lots of this native purplewood
get charlie finn and tell him to put
that sleigh on a platform-of it hes
to have it extend about twenty feet
or more frontward with a railing
around the part that projects

  benson spat and scowled through
the stringy hair over his eyes

  whats the idea commander
pelhams laughter came in short
harsh barks

  those ossies are expecting rein-
deer and reindeer theyre going to
have those animals will have to
stand on something wont they
sure   but wait hold on there
arent any reindeer on ganymede
commander pelham paused on his
way out his eyes narrowed unpleas-
antly as they always did when he
thought of olaf johnson

  olaf is out rounding up eight
spinybacks for us theyve got four
feet a head on one end and a tail
on the other thats close enough for
the ossies

  the old engineer chewed this in-
formation and chuckled nastily

  good i wish the fool joy of his
job

  so do i gritted pelham

  he stalked out as benson still
leering slid underneath the sleigh

the commanders description of
a spinyback was concise and ac-
curate but it left out several inter-
esting details for one thing a spiny-
back has a long mobile snout two
large ears that wave back and forth
gently and two emotional purple
eyes the males have pliable spines
of a deep crimson color along the
backbone that seem to delight the
female of the species combine these
with a scaly muscular tail and a
brain by no means mediocre and you
have a spinyback-or at least you
have one if you can catch him

  it was just such a thought that
occurred to olaf johnson as he
sneaked down from the rocky emi-
nence toward the herd of twenty-
five spinybacks grazing on the
sparse gritty undergrowth the
nearest spinies looked up as olaf
bundled in fur and grotesque with
attached oxygen nosepiece ap-
proached however spinies have no
natural enemies so they merely
gazed at the figure with languidly
christmas on ganymede



disapproving- eyes and returned to
their crunchy but nourishing fare

  olafs notions on bagging big
game were sketchy he fumbled in
his pocket for a lump of sugar held
it out and said

  here pussy pussy pussy pussy
pussy

  the ears of the nearest spinie
twitched in annoyance olaf came
closer and held out the sugar again

  come bossy come bossy

  the spinie caught sight of the
sugar and rolled his eyes at it his
snout twitched as he spat out his
last mouthful of vegetation and am-
bled over with neck stretched out
he sniffed then using a rapid ex-
pert motion he struck at the outheld
palm and flipped the lump into his
mouth olafs other hand whistled
down upon nothingness

  with a hurt expression olaf held
out another piece

  here prince here fido

  the spinie made a law tremulous
sound deep in his throat it was a
sound of pleasure evidently this
strange montrosity before him hav-
ing gone insane intended to feed
him these bits of concentrated suc-
culence forever he snatched and
was back as quickly as the first time
but since olaf had held on firmly
this time the spinie almost bagged
half a finger as well

   olafs yell lacked a bit of the non-
chalance necessary at such times
nevertheless a bite that can be felt
through thick gloves is a bite

  he advanced boldly upon the
spinie there are some things that
stir the johnson blood and bring up
the ancient spirit of the vikings
having ones finger bitten especial-
ly by an unearthly animal is one of
these

  there was an uncertain look in
the spinies eyes as he backed slowly
away there werent any white cubes
being offered any more and he
wasnt quite sure what was going to
happen now the uncertainty van-

ished with a suddenness he did not
expect when two glove-muffled hands
came down upon his ears and jerked
he let out a high-pitched yelp and
charged forward

                                            

a spinie has a certain sense of
dignity however he doesnt
like to have his ears pulled particu-
larly when other spinies including
several unattached females have
formed a ring and are looking on

  the earthman went over back-
ward and remained in that position
for a while meantime the spinie
backed away a few feet in a gentle-
manly manner and allowed johnson
to get to his feet

   the old viking blood frothed still
higher in olaf after rubbing the
hurt spot where he had landed on
his oxygen cylinder he jumped for-
getting to allow for ganymedan
gravity he sailed five feet over the
spinies back

  there was awe in the animals eye
as he watched olaf for it was a
stately jump but there was a cer-
tain amount of bewilderment as well
there seemed to be no purpose to
the maneuver

  olaf landed on his back again and
got the cylinder in the same place
he was beginning to feel a little
embarrassed the sounds that came
from the circle of onlookers were
remarkably like snickers

  laugh he muttered bitterly i
havent even begun to fight yet

  he approached the spinie slowly
cautiously he circled watching for
his opening so did the spinie olaf
feinted and the spinie ducked then
the spinie reared and olaf ducked

  olaf kept remembering new pro-
fanity all the time the husky ur-
r-r-r-r that came out the spinies
throat seemed to lack the brotherly
spirit that is usually associated with
christmas

  there was a sudden swishing
sound olaf felt something collide
with his skull just behind his left
	wonder story annual

ear this time he turned a back som-
ersault and landed on the nape of his
neck

  there was a chorused whinny
from the onlookers and the spinie
waved his tail triumphantly

  olaf got rid of the impression that
he was floating through a star-stud-
ded space and wavered to his feet

  listen he objected using your
tail is a foul

  he leaped back as the tail shot
forward again then flung himself
forward in a diving tackle he
grabbed at the spinies feet and felt
the animal come down on his back
with an indignant yelp

  now it was a case of earth mus-
cles against ganymedan muscles
and olaf became a man of brute
strength he struggled up and the
spinie found himself slung over the
strangers shoulders

  the spinie objected vociferously
and tried to prove his objections by
a judicious whip of the tail but he
was in an inconvenient position and
the stroke whistled harmlessly over
olafs head

  the other spinies made way for
the earthman with saddened ex-
pressions evidently they were all
good friends of the captured animal
and hated to see him lose a fight
they returned to their meal in phil-
osophic resignation plainly con-
vinced that it was kismet

  on the other side of the rocky
ledge olaf reached his prepared
cave there was the briefest of
scrambling struggles before he man-
aged to sit down hard on the spinies
head and put enough knots into rope
to hold him there

  a few hours later when he had
corralled his eighth spiny back he
possessed the technique that comes
of long practice he could have given
a terran cowboy valuable pointers
on throwing a maverick also he
could have given a terran stevedore
lessons in simple and compound
swearing

  twas the night before christmas
-and all through the ganymedan
dome there was deafening noise and
bewildering excitement like an ex-
ploding nova equipped for sound
around the rusty sleigh mounted on
its huge platform of purplewood
five earthmen were staging a battle
royal with a spinie

  the spinie had definite views
about most things and one of his
stubbornest and most definite views
was that he would never go where he
didnt want to go he made that clear
by flailing one head one tail three
spines and four legs in every possi-
ble direction with all possible force

  but the earthmen insisted and
not gently despite loud agonized
squeaks the spinie was lifted onto
the platform hauled into place and
harnessed into hopeless helpless-
ness

  okay peter benson yelled
pass the bottle

itolding the spinies snout with
a one hand benson waved the
bottle under it with the other the
spinie quivered eagerly and whined
tremulously benson poured some of
the liquid down the animals throat
there was a gurgling swallow and an
appreciative whinny the spinies
neck stretched out for more

  benson sighed our best brandy
too

  he up-ended the bottle and with-
drew it half empty the spinie eyes
whirling in their sockets rapidly did
what seemed an attempt at a gay
jig it didnt last long however for
ganymedan metabolism is almost
immediately affected by alcohol his
muscles locked in a drunken rigor
and with a loud hiccup he went out
on his feet

  drag out the next yelled ben-
son

  in an hour the eight spinybacks
were so many cataleptic statues
forked sticks were tied around their
heads as antlers the effect was
christmas on ganymede



crude and sketchy but it would do

  as benson opened his mouth to
ask where olaf johnson was that
worthy showed up in the arms of
three comrades and he was putting
up as stiff a fight as any spinie his
objections however were highly ar-
ticulate

  im not going anywhere in this
damned costume he roared goug-
ing at the nearest eye you hear
me

  there certainly was cause for ob-
jection even at his best olaf had
never been a heart-throb but in his
present condition he resembled a
hybrid between a spinies nightmare
and a picassoan conception of a
patriarch

  he wore the conventional costume
of santa his clothes were as red as
red tissue paper sewed onto his space
coat could make it the ermine
was as white as cotton wool which it
was his beard more cotton wool
glued onto a linen foundation hung
loosely from his ears with that be-
low and his oxygen nosepiece above
even the strongest were forced to
avert their eyes

  olaf had not been shown a mir-
ror but between what he could see
of himself and what his instinct told
him he would have greeted a good
bright lightning bolt like a brother

  by fits and starts he hauled the
sleigh others pitched in to help un-
til olaf was nothing but a smoth-
ered squirm and a muffled voice

  leggo he mumbled leggo and
come at me one by one come on

  he tried to spar a bit to point his
dare but the multiple grips upon
him left him unable to wriggle a
finger

  get in ordered benson

  you go to hell gasped olaf im
not getting into any patented short-
cut to suicide and you can take your
bloody flying sleigh and-

  listen interrupted benson
commander pelham is waiting for
you at the other end hell skin you

alive if you dont show up in half an
hour

  commander pelham can take the
sleigh sideways and-

  then think of your job think of
a hundred and fifty a week- think
of every other year off with pay
think of hilda back on earth who
isnt going to marry you without a
job think of all that

johnson thought snarled he
thought some more got into the
sleigh strapped down his bag and
turned on the gravo-repulsors with
a horrible curse he opened the rear
jet

  the sleigh dashed forward and he
caught himself from going back-
ward over and out of the sleigh by
two-thirds of a whisker he held onto
the sides thereafter watching the
surrounding hills as they rose and
fell with each lurch of the unsteady
sleigh

  as the wind rose the undulations
grew more marked and when jupi-
ter came up its yellow light brought
out every jar and crag of the rocky
ground toward every one of which
in turn the sleigh seemed headed
and by the time the giant planet
had shoved completely over the hori-
zon the curse of drink-which de-
parts from the ganymedan organism
just as quickly as it descends-began
removing itself from the spinies

  the hindmost spinie came out of it
first tasted the inside of his mouth
winced and swore off drink having
made that resolution he took in his
immediate surroundings languidly
they made no immediate impression
on him only gradually was the fact
forced upon him that his footing
whatever it was was not the usual
stable one of solid ganymede it
swayed and shifted which seemed
very unusual

  yet he might have attributed this
unsteadiness to his recent orgy had
he not been so careless as to drop
his glance over the railing to which


wonder story annual

he was anchored no spinie ever died
of heart failure as far as is recorded
but looking downward this one al-
most did

  his agonized screech of horror and
despair brought the other spinies
into full if headachy consciousness
for a while there was a confused
blur of squawking conversation as
the animals tried to get the pain out
of their heads and the facts in both
aims were achieved and a stampede
was organized it wasnt much of a
stampede because the spinies were
tightly anchored but except for the
fact that they got nowhere they
went through all the motions of a
full gallop and the sleigh went
crazy

  olaf grabbed his beard a second
before it let go of his ears

  hey he shouted

  it was kin to saying tut tut
to a hurricane

  the sleigh kicked bucked and did
a hysterical tango it made sudden
spurts as if inspired to dash its
wooden brains out against gany-
medes crust meanwhile olaf prayed
swore wept and jiggled all the com-
pressed air jets at once

  ganymede whirled and jupiter
was a wild blur perhaps it was the
spectacle of jupiter doing the shim-
my that steadied the spinies more
likely it was the fact that they just
didnt give a hang any more what-
ever it was they halted made lofty
farewell speeches to one another
confessed their sins and waited for
death

  the sleigh steadied and olaf re-
sumed his breathing once more only
to stop again as he viewed the curi-
ous spectacle of hills and solid
ground up above and black sky and
swollen jupiter down below

  it was at this point that he too
made his peace with the eternal and
awaited the end

ossie is short for ostrich and
thats what native ganymedans

look like except that their necks are
shorter their heads are larger and
their feathers look as if they were
about to fall out by the roots to this
add a pair of scrawny feathered
arms with three stubby fingers
apiece they can speak english but
when vou hear them you wish they
couldnt

  there were fifty of them in the low
purplewood structure that was their
meeting hall on the mound of
raised dirt in the front of the room
-dark with the smoky dimness of
burning purplewood torches and fet-
id to boot-sat commander scott
pelham and five of his men before
them strutted the frowziest ossie of
them all inflating his huge chest
with rhythmic booming sounds

  he stopped for a moment and
pointed to a ragged hole in the ceil
ing

  look he squawked chimney
we make sannycaws come in

  pelham grunted approval the os-
sie clucked happily he pointed to the
little sacks of woven grass that hung
from the walls

  look stockies sannycaws put
presets

  yeah said pelham unenthusias-
ticallv chimney and stockings
very nice he spoke out of the cor-
ner of his mouth to sim pierce who
sat next to himanother half-hour
in this dump will kill me when is
that fool coming

  pierce stirred uneasily

  listen he said ive been doing
some figuring were safe on every-
thing but the karen leaves and were
still four tons short on that if we
can get this fool business over with
in the next hour so we can start the
next shift and work the ossies at
double we can make it he leaned
back yes i think we can make it

  just about replied pelham
gloomily thats if johnson gets
here without pulling another
bloomer

  the ossie was talking again for
christmas on ganymede



ossies like to talk he said

  every year kissmess comes
kissmess nice ewybody friendly
ossis like kissmess you like kiss-
mess 

  yeah fine pelham snarled po-
litely peace on ganymede good will
toward men-especially johnson
where the devil is that idiot any-
how

  he fell into an annoyed fidget
while the ossie jumped up and down
a few times in a thoughtful sort of
manner evidently for the exercise of
it he continued the jumping vary-
ing it with little hopping dance steps
till pelhams fists began making
strangling gestures only an excited
squawk from the hole in the wall
dignified by the term window kept
pelham from committing ossie-
slaughter

  ossies swarmed about and the
earthmen fought for a view

  against jupiters great yellowness
was outlined a flying sleigh complete
with reindeers it was only a tiny
thing but there was no doubt about
it santa claus was coming

  there was only one thing wrong
with the picture the sleigh rein-
deer and all while plunging ahead
at a terrific speed was flying upside
down

  the ossies dissolved into squawk-
ing cacophony

  sannycaws sannycaws sanny-
caws

  they scrambled out the window
like so many animated dust-mops
gone mad pelham and his men used
the low door

  the sleigh was approaching
growing larger lurching from side
to side and vibrating like an off-cen-
ter fly-wheel olaf johnson was a
tiny figure holding on desperately to
the side of the sleigh with both
hands

pelham was shouting wildly in-
coherently choking on the thin
atmosphere every time he forgot to

breathe through his nose then he
stopped and stared in horror the
sleigh almost life-size now was dip-
ping down if it had been an arrow
shot by william tell it could not
have aimed between pelhams eyes
more accurately

  everybody down he shrieked
and dropped

  the wind of the sleighs passage
whistled keenly and brushed his face
olafs voice could be heard for an
instant high-pitched and indistinct
compressed air spurted leaving
tracks of condensing water vapor

  pelham lay quivering hugging
ganynjedes frozen crust then
knees shaking like a hawaiian hula-
girl he rose slowly the ossies who
had scattered before the plunging
vehicle had assembled again off in
the distance the sleigh was veering
back

  pelham watched as it swayed and
hovered still rotating it lurched
toward the dome curved off to one
side turned back and gathered
speed

  inside that sleigh olaf worked
like a demon straddling his legs
wide he shifted his weight desper-
ately sweating and cursing trying
hard not to look downward at
jupiter he urged the sleigh into
wilder swings it was wobbling
through an angle of  degrees
now and olaf felt his stomach raise
strenuous objections

  holding his breath hejeaned hard
with his right foot and felt the
sleigh swing far over at the ex-
tremity of that swing he released
the gravo-repulsor and in gany-
medes weak gravity the sleigh
jerked downward naturally since
the vehicle was bottom-heavy due to
the metal gravo-repulsor beneath it
righted itself as it fell

  but this was little comfort to com-
mander pelham who found himself
once more in the sleighs direct path

  down he yelled and dropped
again


wonder story annual

  the sleigh whi-i-ished overhead
came up against a huge boulder with
a crack bounced twenty-five feet
into the air came down with a rush
and a bang and olaf fell over the
railing and out

  santa claus had arrived

  with a deep shuddering breath
olaf swung his bag over his shoul-
ders adjusted his beard and patted
one of the silently suffering spinies
on the head death might be coming
-in fact olaf could hardly wait-
but he was going to die on his feet
nobly like a johnson

  inside the shack into which the
ossies had once more swarmed a
thump announced the arrival of san-
tas bag on the roof and a second
thud the arrival of santa himself
a ghastly face appeared through the
makeshift hole in the ceiling

  merrv christmas-it croaked
and tumbled through

  olaf landed on his oxygen cylin-
ders as usual and got them in the
usual place

  the ossies jumped up and down
like rubber balls with the itch

  olaf limped heavily toward the
first stocking and deposited the gar-
ishly colored sphere he withdrew
from his bae one of the many that
had originally been intended as a
christmas tree ornament one by
one he deposited the rest in every
available stocking

  having completed his job he
dropped into an exhausted squat
from which position he watched sub-
sequent procedings with a glazed and
fishv eye the jolliness and belly-
shaking good humor traditionally
characteristic of santa claus were
absent from this one with remark-
able thoroughness

  the ossies made up for it by their
wild ecstasy until olaf had deposit-
ed the last globe they had kept their
silence and their seats but when
he had finished the air heaved and
writhed under the stresses of the
discordant screeches that arose in

half a second the hand of each ossie
contained a globe

  they chattered among themselves
furiously handling the globes care-
fully and hugging them close to their
chests then they compared one with
another flocking about to gaze at
particularly good ones

the frowziest ossie approached
pelham and plucved at the com-
manders sleeve sannycaws good
he cackled look he leave eggs he
stared reverently at his sphere and
said pittiern ossie eggs must be
sannycaws eggs huh 

  his skinnr finger punched pelham
in the stomach

  no vowled pelham vehementlv
hell no

  but the ossie wasnt listening he
plunged the globe deep into the
warmth of his feathers and said
pitty colors how long take for
little sannycaws come out and
what little sannycaws eat he
looked up we take good care we
teach little sannycaws make him
smart and full of brain like ossie
pierce grabbed commander pel-
hams arm

  dont argue with them he whis-
pered frantically what do you care
if they think those are santa claus
eggs come on if we work like ma-
niacs we can still make the quota
lets get started

  thats right pelham admitted
he turned to the sie tell every-
one to get going lie spoke clearly
and loudly work now do you un-
derstand hurry hurry hurry
come on

  he motioned with his arms but
the frowzy ossie had come to a sud-
den halt he said slowly we work
but johnson say kissmess come evvv
year

  isnt one christmas enough for
you pelham rasped

  no squawked the ossie we
want sannycaws next year get more
eggs and next year more eggs and
christmas on ganymede



next year and next year more eggs
more little sannycaws eggs if san-
nycaws not come we not work
thats a long time off said pel-
ham well talk about it then by
that time ill either have gone com-
pletely crazy or youll have forgot-
ten all about it

  pierce opened his mouth closed
it opened his mouth closed it op-
ened it and then finally managed to
speak

  commander they want him to
come every year

  i know they wont remember by
next year though

  but you dont get it a year to
them is one ganymedan revolution
around jupiter in earth time thats
seven days and three hours they

want santa claus to come every
week

  every week pelham gulped
johnson told them-

  for a moment everything turned
sparkling somersaults before his
eyes he choked and automatically
his eye sought olaf

  olaf turned cold to the marrow of
his bones and rose to his feet ap-
prehensively sidling toward the
door there he stopped as a sudden
recollection of tradition hit him
beard a-dangle he croaked

  merry christmas to all and to all
a good night

  he made for the sleigh as if all
the imps of hades were after him
the imps werent but commander

she made a dutiful round of the fam-


wonder story annual

ilv kissing them all grandmother
keaton and chillv aunt bessie and
the four uncles she did not hesitate
when she came to the new uncle-
who was different

  the other kids watched her with
impassive eves they knew they
saw she knew but they said noth-
ing just then jane realized she
could not mention the-the trouble
-either until they brought it up
that ws part of the silent etiouette
of childhood but the whole house
was full of uneasiness the adults
merelv sensed a trouble something
vaguely wrng the children jane
saw knew

  afterward they gathered in the
back yard under the big date-palm
jane ostentatiouslyjfingered her new
necklace and waited she saw the
looks the others exchanged-looks
that said do you think she really
noticed and finally beatrice the
oldest suggested hide-and-seek

  we ought to tell her bee little
charles said

 beatrice kept her eyes from
charles

  tell her what youre crazy
charles

  charles was insistent but vague

  you know

  keep your old secret jane said
i know what it is anyhow hes not
my uncle

  see emily crowed she did too
see it i told you shed notice

  its kind of funny jane said she
knew very well that the man in the
living room wasnt her uncle and
never had been and he was pretend-
ing quite hard-hard enough to
convince the grown-ups-that he
had always been here with the clear
unprejudiced eye of immaturity
jane could see that he wasnt an-or-
dinary grown-up he was sort of-
empty

 he just came emily said
about three weeks ago

  three days charles corrected
trying to help but his temporal

sense wasnt dependent on the cal-
endar he measured time by the
yardstick of events and days werent
standard sized for him they were
longer when he was sick or when it
rained and far too short when he
was riding the merry-go-round at
ocean park or playing games in the
back yard

  it was three weeks beatrice
said

 whered he come from jane
asked

  there were secret glances ex-
changed

  i dont know beatrice said care-
fullv

  he came out of a big round hole
that kept going around charles
said its like a christmas tree
through there all fiery

  dont tell lies emily said did
you ever truly see that charles

  no only sort of

  dont they noticp jane meant
the adults

  no beatrice told her and the
children all looked toward the house
and pondered the inscrutable ways
of grown-ups they act like hes al-
ways been here even granny aunt
bessie said he came before i did
only i knew that wasnt right

  three weeks charles said
changing his mind

  hes making them all feel sick
emily said aunt bessie takes as-
pirins all the time

jane considered on the face of it
the situation seemed a little silly
an uncle three weeks old perhaps
the adults were merely pretending
as they sometimes did with esoteric
adult motives but somehow that
didnt seem quite the answer chil-
dren are never deceived very long
about such things

  charles now that the ice was
broken and jane no longer an out-
sider burst suddenly into excited
gabble

  tell her bee the real secret-
call him demon



you know can i show her the road
of yellow bricks please bee
huh r

  then the silence again charles
was talking too much jane knew the
road of yellow bricks of course it
ran straight through oz from the
deadly desert to the emerald city
after a long time emily nodded
we got to tell her you know she
said onlv she might get scared
its so dark

  you were scared bobby said
you cried the first time

  i didnt anyhow it-its only
make believe

  oh no charles said i reached
out and touched the crown last
time

  it isnt a crown emily said its
him ruggedo

  jane thought of the uncle who
wasnt a real uncle-who wasnt a
real person is he ruggedo she
asked

  the children understood

  oh no charles said ruggedo
lives in the cellar we give him meat
all red and bluggy he likes it gob-
ble gobble

  beatrice looked at jane she nod-
ded toward the clubhouse which was
a piano-box with a genuine secret
lock then somehow quite deftly
she shifted the conversation onto
another subject a game of cowboys-
and-indians started presently and
bobby howling terribly led the rout
around the house

  the piano-box smelled pleasantly
of acacia drifting through the
cracks beatrice and jane huddled
together in the warm dimness heard
diminishing indian-cries in the dis-
tance beatrice looked curiously
adult just now

  im glad you came janie she
said the little kids dont under-
stand at all its pretty awful
who is he

  beatrice shivered i dont know i
think he lives in the cellar she
hesitated you have to get to him

through the attic though id be aw-
fully scared if the little kids werent
so-so-they dont seem to mind at
all

 but bee who is he

  beatrice turned her head and
looked at jane and it was quite
evident then that she could not or
would not say there was a barrier
but because it was important she
tried she mentioned the wrong
uncle

  i think ruggedos the same as
him i know he is really charles and
bobby say so-and they know they
know better than i do theyre lit-
tler   its hard to explain but-
well its sort of like the scoodlers
remember

  the scoodlers that unpleasant
race that dwelt in a cavern on the
road to oz and had the convenient
ability to detach their heads and
hurl them at passersby after a mo-
ment the parallel became evident a
schoodler could have his head in one
place and his body in another but
both parts would belong to the same
scoodler

of course the phantom uncle
had a head and a body both
but jane could understand vaguely
the possibility of his double nature
one of him moving deceptively
through the house focus of a strange
malaise and the other nameless
formless nesting in a cellar and
waiting for red meat   

  charles knows more than any of
us about it beatrice said he was
the one who found out wed have to
feed r-ruggedo we tried different
things but it has to be raw meat
and if we stopped-something awful
would happen we kids found that
out

  it was significant that jane didnt
ask how children take their equiva-
lent of telepathy for granted

  they dont know beatrice add-
ed we cant tell them

  no jane said and the two girls


wonder story annual

looked at one another caught in the
terrible helpless problem of imma-
turity the knowledge that the mores
of the adult world are too complicat-
ed to understand and that children
must walk warily

  adults are always right they are
an alien race

  luckily for the other children
they had come upon the enemy in
a body one child alone might have
had violent hysterics but charles
who made the first discoveries was
only six still young enough so that
the process of going insane in that
particular way wasnt possible for
him a six-year-old is in a congeni-
tally psychotic state it is normal to
him

  and theyve been sick ever since
he came beatrice said

  jane had already seen that a wolf
may don sheepskin and slide unob-
served into a flock but the sheep are
apt to become nervous though they
can not discover the source of their
discomfort

  it was a matter of mood even he
showed the same mood-uneasiness
waiting sensing that something was
wrong and not knowing what-but
with him it was simply a matter of
camouflage jane could tell he didnt
want to attract attention by varying
from the arbitrary norm he had
chosen-that of the human form

jane accepted it the uncle who
was-empty-the one in the cellar
called ruggedo who had to be fed
regularly on raw jjjeat so that some-
thing wouldnt happen   

  a masquerader from somewhere
he had power and he had limita-
tions the obvious evidences of his
power were accepted without ques-
tion

  children are realists it was not
incredible to them for this hungry
inhuman stranger to appear among
them-for here he was

  he came from somewhere out of
time or space or an inconceivable

place he never had any human feel-
ings  the children sensed that easily
he pretended very cleverly to be
human and he could warp the adult
minds to implant artificial memories
of his existence the adults thought
they remembered him an adult will
recognize a mirage- a child will be
deceived but conversely an intellec-
tual mirage will deceive an adult
not a child

  ruggedos power couldnt warp
their minds for those were neither
quite human nor quite sane from the
adult standpoint beatrice who was
oldest was afraid she had the be-
ginnings of empathy and imagina-
tion

  little charlie felt mostly ex-
citement bobbie the smallest had
already begun to be bored  

  perhaps later beatrice remem-
bered a little of what ruggedo
looked like but the others never did
for they reached him by a very
strange road and perhaps they
were somewhat altered themselves
duiing the time they were with him
he accepted or rejected food that
was all upstairs the body of the
scoodler pretended to be human
while the scoodlers head lay in that
little horrible nest he had made by
warping space so he was invisible
and intangible to anyone who didnt
know how to find the road of yel-
low bricks

  what was he without standards
of comparison-and there are none
in this world-he cannot be named
the children thought of him as rug-
gedo but he was not the fat half-
comic inevitably frustrate gnome
king

  he was never that

  call him demon

  as a name-symbol it implies too
much and not enough but it will
have to do by the standard of ma-
turity he was monster alien super-
being but because of what he did
and what he wanted-call him
demon

raw red meat

one afternoon a few days later
beatrice hunted up jane how
much money have you got janie
she asked

  four dollars and thirty-five
cents jane said after investigation
dad gave me five dollars at the
station i bought some popcorn and
-well-different things

  gee im glad you came when you
did beartice blew out a long
breath tacitly it was agreed that
the prevalent socialism of childhood
clubs would apply in this more ur-
gent clubbing together of interests
janes small hoard was available not
for any individual among them but
for the good of the group we were
running out of money beatrice
said granny caught us taking meat
out of the icebox and we dont dare
any more cut we can get a lot with
your money

  neither of them thought of the
inevitable time when that fund
would be exhausted four dollars
and thirty-five cents seemed fabu-
lous in that era and they neednt
buy expensive meat so long as it
was raw and bloody

  they walked together down the
acacia-shaded street with its occa-
sional leaning palms and drooping
pepper-trees they bought two
pounds of hamburger and improvi-
dently squandered twenty cents on
sodas

  when they got back to the house
sunday lethargy had set in uncles
simon and james had gone out for
cigars and uncles lew and bert
were residing the papers while aunt
bessie crocheted grandmother kea-
ton read youngs magazine diligent-
ly seeking spicy passages the two
girls paused behind the beaded por-

tieres looking in

  come on kids lew said in his
deep resonant voice seen the fun-
nies yet mutt and jeff are good
and spark plug-

  mr gibson is good enough for
me grandmother keaton said
hes a real artist his people look
like people

  the door banged open and uncle
james appeared fat grinning ob-
viously happy from several beers
uncle simon paced him like a person-
ified conscience

   at any rate its quiet he said
turning a sour glance on jane and
beatrice the children make such
a rumpus sometimes i cant hear my-
self think

  granny beatrice asked where
are the kids

   in the kitchen i think dear they
wanted some water for something
thanks the two girls went out
leaving the room filled with a grow-
ing atmosphere of sub-threshold dis-
comfort the sheep were sensing the
wolf among them but the sheepskin
disguise was sufficient they did not
know   

   the kids were in the kitchen busi-
ly painting one section of thl comics
with brushes and water when you
did that pictures emerged one page
of the newspaper had been chemical-
ly treated so that moisture would
bring out the various colors dull
pastels but singularly glamorous in
a class with the japanese flowers
that would bloom in water and the
chinese paper-shelled almonds that
held tiny prizes

  from behind her beatrice deftly
produced the butchers package

  two pounds she said janie
had some money and mertons was
open this afternoon i thought wed
better  

  emily kept on painting diligently
charles jumped up

  are we going up now huh 
jane was uneasy i dont know if
id better come along i-


wonder story annual

  i dont want to either bobby
said but that was treason charles
saild bobby was scared

  im not it just isnt any fun i
want to play something else

  emily beatrice said softly
you dont have to go this time

  yes i do emily looked up at
last from her painting im not
scared

  i want to see the lights charles
said beatrice whirled on him

  you tell such lies charles there
arent any lights

  there are so sometimes any-
how

  there arent

  there are so youre too dumb to
see them lets go and feed him

it was understood that beatrice
took command now she was the
oldest she was also jane sensed
more afraid than the others even
emily

  they went upstairs beatrice car-
rying the parcel of meat she had
already cut the string in the upper
hall they grouped before a door

  this is the way janie charles
said rather proudly we gotta go
up to the attic theres a swing-down
ladder in the bathroom ceiling we
have to climb up on the tub to
reach

  my dress jane said doubtfully

  you wont get dirty come on

  charles wanted to be first but he
was too short beatrice climbed to
the rim of the tub and tugged at a
ring in the ceiling the trap-door
creaked and the stairs ascended
slowly with a certain majesty be-
side the tub it wasnt dark up there
light came vaguely through the at-
tic windows

  come on janie beatrice said
with a queer breathlessness and
they all scrambled up somehow by
dint of violent acrobatics

  the attic was warm quiet and
dusty planks were laid across the
beams cartons and trunks were

here and there

beatrice was already walking
along one of the beams jane
watched her

 beatrice didnt look back she
 didnt say anything once her hand
 groped out behind her charles who
 was nearest took it then beatrice
 reached a plank laid across to an-
 other rafter she crossed it she
 went on-stopped-and came back
 with charles

you werent doing it right
charles said disappointedly you
were thinking of the wrong thing

 beatrices face looked oddly white
 in the golden faint light

jane met her cousins eyes
bee-

 you have to think of something
 else beatrice said quickly its all
 right come on

 charles at her heels she started
 again across the plank charles was
 saying something in a rhythmic
 mechanical monotone

     one two buckle my shoe

three four knock at the door

     five six pick up sticks-

 beatrice disappeared

     seven eight lay them-

 charles disappeared

 bobby his shoulders expressing
 rebelliousness followed and van-
 ished

 emily made a small sound

 oh-emily jane said

 but her youngest cousin only said
 i dont want to go down there
 janie

 you dont have to

 yes i do emily said ill tell
 you what i wont be afraid if you
 come right after me i always think
 theres something coming up behind
 me to grab-but if you promise to
 come right after itll be all right

 i promise jane said

 reassured emily walked across
 the bridge jane was watching close-
 ly this time yet she did not see
call him demon



emily disappear she was suddenly
-gone jane stepped forward and
stopped as a sound came from down-
stairs

  jane aunt bessies voice
jane it was louder and more per-
emptory now jane where are you 
come here to me

  jane stood motionless looking
across the plank bridge it was quite
empty and there was no trace of
emily or the other children the at-
tic was suddenly full of invisible
menace yet she would have gone on
because of her promise if-

  jane

  jane reluctantly dcscendcd and
followed the summons to aunt bes-
sies bedroom that prim-mouthed
woman was pinning fabric and mov-
ing her lips impatiently

  where on earth have you been
jane  ive been calling and calling
we were playing jane said
did you want me aunt bessie

  i should say i did aunt bessie
said this collar ive been crochet-
ing its a dress for you come here
and let me try it on how you grow
child

  and after that there was an eter-
nity of pinning and wriggling while
jane kept thinking of emily alone
and afraid somewhere in the attic
she began to hate aunt bessie yet
the thought of rebellion or escape
never crossed her mind the adults
were absolute monarchs as far as
relative values went trying on the
collar was more important at this
moment than anything else in the
world at least to the adults who
administered the world

  while emily alone and afraid on
the bridge that led to-elsewhere

the uncles were playing poker
aunt gertrude the vaudeville ac-
tress had unexpectedly arrived for a
few days and was talking with
grandmother keaton and aunt bes-
sie in the living room aunt gertrude
was small and pretty very charm-

ing with a bisque delicacy and a
gusto for life that filled jane with
admiration but she was subdued
now

  this place gives me the creeps
she said making a dart with her
folded fan at janes nose hello fun-
ny-face why arent you playing
with the other kids 

  oh im tired jane said won-
dering about emily it had been near-
ly an hour since-

  at your age i was never tired
aunt gertrude said now look at
me three a day and that awful
straight man ive got-ma did i tell
you- the voices pitchcd lower

  jane watched aunt bessies skin-
ny fingers move monotonously as she
darted her crochet hook through the
silk

  this place is a morgue aunt
gertrude said suddenly whats
wrong with everybody whos
dead

  its the air aunt bessie said
too hot the year round

  you play rochester in winter
bessie my girl and youll be glad of
a warm climate it isnt that any-
way i feel like-mm-m-its like be-
ing on stage after the curtains gone
up

  its your fancy her mother said

  ghosts aunt gertrude said and
was silent grandmother keaton
looked sharply at jane

  come over here child she said

  room was made on the soft capa-
cious lap that had held so many
youngsters

  jane snuggled against the reassur-
ing warmth and tried to let her mind
go blank transferring all sense of re-
sponsibility to grandmother keaton
but it wouldnt work there was
something wrong in the house and
the heavy waves of it beat out from
a center very near them

  the wrong uncle hunger and the
avidity to be fed the nearness of
bloody meat tantalizing him as he
lay hidden in his strange unguess-


wonder story annual

able nest elsewhere-otherwhere-
in that strange place where the chil-
dren had vanished

  he was down there slavering for
the food he was up here empty
avid a vortex of hunger very near-
by

  he was double a double uncle
masked but terrifyingly clear  

  jane closed her eyes and dug her
head deeper into grandmother
keatons shoulder

  aunt gertrude gossiped in an odd-
ly tense voice as if she sensed wrong-
ness under the surface and was
frightened subtly

  im opening at santa barbara in
a couple of days ma she said i-
whats wrong with this house any-
how  im as jumpy as a cat today-
and i want you all to come down and
catch the first show its a musical
comedy ive been promoted

  ive seen the prince of pilsen
before grandmother keaton said

  not with me in it its my treat
ive engaged rooms at the hotel al-
ready the kids have to come too
want to see your auntie act jane
jane nodded against her grand-
mothers shoulder

  auntie jane said suddenly
did vou see all the uncles
certainly i did

  all of them uncle james and
uncle bert and uncle simon and
uncle lew

  the whole kaboodle why

  i just wondered

  so aunt gertrude hadnt noticed
the wrong uncle either she wasnt
truly observant jane thought

  i havent seen the kids though
if they dont hurry up they wont
get any of the presents ive brought
youd never guess what i have for
you janie

  but jane scarcely heard even that
exciting promise for suddenly the
tension in the air gave way the
wrong uncle who had been a vortex
of hunger a moment before was a
vortex of ecstasy now somewhere

somehow at last ruggedo was being
fed somewhere somehow that
other half of the double uncle was de-
vouring his bloody fare   

janie was not in grandmother
keatons lap any more the room
was a spinning darkness that winked
with tiny lights-christmas tree
lights charles had called them-and
there was a core of terror in the cen-
ter of the whirl here in the van-
ished room the wrong uncle was a
funnel leading from that unimagin-
able nest where the other half of him
dwelt and through the funnel into
the room poured the full ecstatic
tide of his satiety

  somehow in this instant jane was
very near the other children who
must stand beside that spinning
focus of darkness she could almost
sense their presence almost put out
her hand to touch theirs

  now the darkness shivered and
the bright tiny lights drew together
and into her mind came a gush of
impossible memories she was too
near him and he was careless as he
fed he was not guarding his
thoughts they poured out formless
as an animals filling the dark
thoughts of red food and of other
times and places where that same
red food had been brought him by
otiier hands

  it was incredible the memories
were not of earth not of this time
or place he had traveled far rug-
gedo in many guises he remem-
bered now in a flow of shapeless fis-
sions he remembered tearing
through furred sides that squirmed
away from his hunger remembered
the gush of hot sweet redness
through the fur

  not the fur of anything jane had
ever imagined before   

  he remembered a great court
paved with shining things and some-
thing in bright chains in the center
and rings of watching eyes as he en-
tered and neared the sacrifice
call him demon	

  as he tore his due from its smooth
sides the cruel chains clanked
around him as he fed 

  jane tried to close her eyes and not
watch but it was not with eyes that
she watched and she was ashamed
and a little sickened because she was
sharing in that feast tasting the
warm red sweetness with ruggedo
in memory feeling the spin of ec-
stasy through her head as it spun
through his

  ah-the kids are coming now
aunt gertrude was saying from a
long way off

  jane heard her dimly and then
more clearly and then suddenly
grandmother keatons lap was soft
beneath her again and she was back
in the familiar room a herd of ele-
phants on the stairs eh  aunt ger-
trude said

  they were returning jane could
hear them too now really they were
making much less noise than usual
they were subdued until about half-
way down the stairs and then there
was a sudden outburst of clattering
and chatter that rang false to janes
ears

  tiie children came in beatrice a
little white emily pink and puffy
around the eyes charles was bub-
bling over with repressed excitement
but bobby the smallest was glum
and bored at sight of aunt ger-
trude the uproar redoubled though
beatrice exchanged a quick signifi-
cant glance with jane

  then presents and noise and the
uncles coming back in excited dis-
cussion of the trip to santa barbara
-a strained cheeriness that some-
how kept dying down into heavy si-
lence

  none of the adults ever really
looked over their shoulders but-the
feeling was of bad things to come

  only the children-not even aunt
gertrude-were aware of the com-
plete emptiness of the wrong uncle
the projection of a lazy torpid semi-
mindless entity superficially he was

as convincingly human as if he had
never focused his hunger here under
this roof never let his thoughts
whirl through the minds of the chil-
dren never remembered his red
dripping feasts of other times and
places

  he was very sated now they could
feel the torpor pulsing out in slow
drowsy waves so that all the grown-
ups were yawning and wondering
why but even now he was empty
not real the nobody-there feel-
ing was as acute as ever to all the
small keen perceptive minds that
saw him as he was

ill

sated eater

later at bedtime only charles
wanted to talk about the matter
it seemed to jane that beatrice had
grown up a little since the early af-
ternoon bobby was reading the
jungle book or pretending to with
much pleased admiration of the pic-
tures showing shere khan the tiger
emily had turned her face to the wall
and was pretending to be asleep

  aunt bessie called me jane told
her sensing a faint reproach i
tried as soon as i could to get away
from her she wanted to try that
collar thing onme

  oh the apology was accepted
but beatrice still refused to talk
jane went over to emilys bed and
put her arm around the little girl
mad at me emily 

  no

  you are though i couldnt help
it honey

  it was all right emily said i
didnt care

  all bright and shiny charles
said sleepily like a christmas
tree

  beatrice whirled on him shut
lftfi	wonder story annual

up she cried shut up charles
shut up shut up shxit up

  aunt bessie put her head into the
room

  whats the matter children
she asked

  nothing auntie beatrice said
we were just playing

  fed temporarily satiated it lay
torpid in its curious nest the house
was silent the occupants asleep
even the wrong uncle slept for
ruggedo was a good mimic

  the wrong uncle was not a phan-
tasm not a mere projection of rug-
gedo as an amoeba extends a pseu-
dopod toward food so ruggedo had
extended and created the wrong
uncle but there the parallel stopped
for the wrong uncle was not an
elastic extension that could be with-
drawn at will rather he-it-was
a permanent limb as a mans arm is
from the brain through the neural
system the message goes and the
arm stretches out the fingers con-
strict-and there is food in the
hands grip

  but ruggedos extension was less
limited it was not permanently
bound by rigid natural laws of nat-
ter an am mav be painted black
and the wrong uncle looked and act-
ed human except to clear immature
eyes

  there were rules to be followed
even by ruggedo the natural laws
of a world could bind it to a certain
extent there were cycles the life-
span of a moth-caterpillar is run by
cycles and before it can soin its co-
coon and metamorphose it must eat
-eat-eat not until the time of
change has come can it evade its cur-
rent incarnation nor could ruggedo
change now until the end of its cy-
cle had come then there would be
another metamorphosis ns there had
already in the unthinkable eternity
of its past been a million curious mu-
tations

  but at present it was bound by
the rules of its current cycle the ex-

tension could not be withdrawn and
the wrong uncle was a part of it
and it was a part of the wrong uncle

  the scoodlers body and the scood-
lers head

  through the dark house beat the
unceasing drowsy waves of satiety
-slowly imperceptibly quickening
toward that nervous pulse of avidity
that always came after the processes
of indigestion and digestion had been
completed

  aunt bessie rolled over and began
to snore in another room the wrong
uncle without waking turned on his
back and also snored

  the talent of protective mimicry
was well developed  

it was afternoon again though by
only half an hour and the pulse in
the house had changed subtly in tem-
po and mood	

  if were going up to santa bar-
bara grandmother keaton had
said im going to take the children
down to the dentist today their
teeth want cleaning and its hard
enough to get an appointment with
dr hover for one youngster not to
mention four jane your mother
wrote me youd been to the dentist a
month ago so you neednt go

  after that the trouble hung unspo-
ken over the children but no one
mentioned it only as grandmother
keaton herded the kids out on the
porch beatrice waited till last jane
was in the doorway watching bea-
trice reached behind her without
looking fumbled found janes hand
and squeezed it hard that was all

  but the responsibility had been
passed on no words had been need-
ed beatrice had said plainly that it
was janes job now it was her re-
sponsibility

  she dared not delay too long she
was too vividly aware of the rising
tide of depression affecting the
adults ruggedo was getting hungry
again

  she watched her cousins till they
call him demon



vanished beneath the pepper-trees
and the distant rumble of the trolley
put a period to any hope of their re-
turn after that jane walked to the
butcher shop and bought two pounds
of meat she drank a soda then she
came back to the house

  she felt the pulse beating out fast-
er

  she got a tin pan from the kitchen
and put the meat on it and slipped
up to the bathroom it was hard to
reach the attic with her burden and
without help but she did it in the
warm stillness beneath the roof she
stood waiting half-hoping to hear
aunt bessie call again and relieve
her of this duty but no voice came

  the simple mechanics of what she
had to do were sufficiently prosaic to
keep fear at a little distance be-
sides she was scarcely nine and it
was not dark in the attic

  she walked along the rafter bal-
ancing till she came to the plank
bridge she felt its resilient vibration
underfoot

      one two buckle my shoe

      three four knock at the door

       five six pick up sticks

      seven eight-

  she missed the way twice the
third time she succeeded the mind
had to be at just the right pitch of
abstraction   she crossed the
bridge and turned and-

it was dim almost dark in this
place it smelled cold and hollow
of the underground without sur-
prise she knew she was deep down
perhaps beneath the house perhaps
very far away from it that was as
acceptable to her as the rest of the
strangeness she felt no surprise

  curiously she seemed to know the
way she was going- into a tiny en-
closure and yet at the same time she
wandered for awhile through low-
roofed hollow spaces endless very
dim smelling of cold and moisture
an unpleasant place to the mind

and a dangerous place as well to wan-
der through with ones little pan of
meat

  it found the meat acceptable

  looking back later jane had no
recollection whatever of it she did
not know how she had proffered the
food or how it had been received or
where in that place of paradoxical
space and smallness it lay dreaming
of other worlds and eras

  she only knew that the darkness
spun around her again winking with
little lights as it devoured its food
memories swirled from its mind to
hers as if the two minds were of one
fabric she saw more clearly this
time she saw a great winged thing
caged in a glittering pen and she re-
membered as ruggedo remembered
and leaped with ruggedos leap feel-
ing the wings buffet about her and
feeling her rending hunger rip into
the body and tasting avidly the hot
sweet salty fluid bubbling out

  it was a mixed memory blending
with it other victims shifted be-
neath ruggedos grip the feathery
pinions becoming the best of great
clawed arms and the writhe of rep-
tilian litheness all his victims be-
came one in memory as he ate

  one flash of another memory
opened briefly toward the last jane
was aware of a great swaying gar-
den of flowers larger than herself
and of cowled figures moving silently
among them and of a victim with
showering pale hair lying helpless
upon the lip of one gigantic flower
held down with chains like shining
blossoms and it seemed to jane that
she herself went cowled among those
silent figures and that he-it-rug-
gedo-in another guise walked be-
side her toward the sacrifice

  it was the first human sacrifice he
had recalled jane would have liked
to know more about that she had no
moral scruples of course food was
food but the memory flickered
smoothly into another picture and
she never saw the end she did not


wonder story annual

really need to see it there was only
one end to all these memories per-
haps it was as well for her that rug-
gedo did not dwell overlong on that
particular moment of all his bloody
meals

   seventee eighteen

         maids in waiting

  nineteen twenty-

  she tilted precariously back across
the rafters holding her empty pan
the attic smelled dusty it helped to
take away the reek of remembered
crimson from her mind 

  when the children came back bea-
trice said simply did you and
jane nodded the taboo still held
they would not discuss the matter
more fully except in case of real need
and the drowsy toipid heat in the
house the psychic emptiness of the
wrong uncle showed plainly that
the danger had been averted again-
for a time   

  read me about mowgli granny
bobby said grandmother keaton
settled down wiped and adjusted her
spectacles and took up kipling pres-
ently the other children were drawn
into the charmed circle grandmoth-
er spoke of shere khans downfall-
of the cattle driven into the deep
gulch to draw the tiger-and of
the earth-shaking stampede that
smashed the killer into bloody pulp

  well grandmother keaton said
closing the book thats the end of
shere khan hes dead now

  no he isnt bobby roused and
said sleepily

  of course he is good and dead
the cattle killed him

  only at the end granny if you
start reading at the beginning again
shere khans right there

  bobby of course was too young to
have any conception of death you
were killed sometimes in games of
cowboys-and-indians an ending
neither regrettable nor fatal death
is an absolute term that needs per-
sonal experience to be made under-
standable

  uncle lew smoked his pipe and
wrinkled the brown skin around his
eyes at uncle bert who bit his lips
and hesitated a long time between
moves but uncle lew won the chess
game anyway uncle james winked
at aunt gertrude and said he
thought hed take a walk would she
like to come along she would

  after their departure aunt bessie
looked up sniffed

  you just take a whiff of their
breaths when they come back ma
she said why do you stand for it 
but grandmother keaton chuckled
and stroked bobbys hair he had
fallen asleep on her lap his hands
curled into small fists his cheeks
faintly flushed

  uncle simons gaunt figure stood
by the window

  he watched through the curtains
and said nothing at all

  early to bed aunt bessie said
if were going to santa barbara in
the morning children

  and that was that

iv

end of the game

by morning bobby was running
a temperature and grandmoth-
er keaton refused to risk his life in
santa barbara this made bobby
very sullen but solved the problem
the children had been wondering
about for many hours also a tele-
phone call from janes father said
that he was arriving that day to pick
up his daughter and she had a little
brother now jane who had no illu-
sions about the stork was relieved
and hoped her mother wouldnt be
sick any more now

  a conclave was held in bobbys
bedroom before breakfast

  you know what to do bobby
beatrice said promise youll do it 
call him demon



  promise uh-huh

  you can do it today janie before
your father comes and youd better
get a lot of meat and leave it for
bobby

  i cant buy any meat without
money bobby said somewhat re-
luctantly beatrice counted out what
was left of janes small hoard and
handed it over bobby stuffed the
change under his pillow and pulled
at the red flannel wound around his
neck

  it scratches he said im not
sick anyway

  it was those green pears you ate
yesterday emily said very meanly
you thought nobody saw you didnt
you 

  charles came in he had been
downstairs he was breathless

  hey know what happened he
said he hurt his foot now he cant
go to santa barbara i bet he did it
on purpose

  gosh jane said how

  he said he twisted it on the
stairs but i bet its a lie he just
doesnt want to go

  maybe he cant go-that far
beatrice said with a sudden flash of
intuition and they spoke no more of
the subject but beatrice emily and
charles were all relieved that the
wrong uncle was not to go to santa
barbara with them after all

  it took two taxis to carry the trav-
elers and their luggage grandmoth-
er keaton the wrong uncle and
jane stood on the front porch and
waved the automobiles clattered off
and jane promptly got some money
from bobby and went to the butcher
store returning heavy-laden

  the wrong uncle leaning on a
cane hobbled into the sun-parlor and
lay down grandmother keaton made
a repulsive but healthful drink for
bobby and jane decided not to do
what she had to do until afternoon
bobby read the jungle book
stumbling over the hard words and
for the while the truce held

  jane was not to forget that day
quickly the smells were sharply dis-
tinct  the odor of baking bread from
the kitchen the sticky-sweet flower
scents from outside the slightly
dusty rich-brown aroma exhaled by
the sun-warmed rugs and furniture
grandmother keaton went up to her
bedroom to eoldcream her hands and
face and jane lounged on the
threshold watching

  it was a charming room in its
comfortable unimaginative way
the curtains were so stiffly starched
that they billowed out in crisp white-
ness and the bureau was cluttered
with fascinating objects-a pin-
cushion shaped like a doll a tiny red
china shoe with tinier gray china
mice on it a cameo brooch bearing a
portrait of grandmother keaton as
a girl

  and slowly insistently the pulse
increased felt even here in this bed-
room where jane felt it was a rather
impossible intrusion

  directly after lunch the bell rang
and it was janes father come to
take her back to san francisco he
was in a hurry to catch the train
and there was time only for a hurried
conversation before the two were
whisked off in the waiting taxi but
jane had found time to run upstairs
and say good-by to bobby-and tell
him where the meat was hidden

  all right janie bobby said
good-by

  she knew she should not have left
the job to bobby a nagging sense of
responsibility haunted her all the
way to the railroad station she was
only vaguely aware of adult voices
saying the train would be very late
and of her father suggesting that
the circus was in town

it was a good circus she almost
forgot bobby and the crisis that
would be mounting so dangerously
unless he met it as he had promised
early evening was blue as they
moved with the crowd out of the


wonder story annual

tent and then through a rift jane
saw a small familiar figure and the
bottom dropped out of her stomach
she knew

  mr larkin saw bobby in almost
the same instant he called sharply
and a moment later the two children
were looking at one another bobbys
plump face sullen

 does your grandmother know
youre here bobby mr ijarkin
said

  well i guess not bobby said

  you ought to be paddled young
man come along both of you ill
have to phone her right away shell
be worried to death

  in the drug store while he tele-
phoned jane looked at her cousin
she was suffering the first pangs of
maturitys burden the knowledge of
responsibility misused

  bobby she said did you

  you leave me alone bobby said
with a scowl there was silence

  mr larkin came back nobody
answered ive called a taxi therell
be just time to get bobby back be-
fore our train leaves

  in the taxi also there was mostly
silence as for what might be hap-
pening at the house jane did not
think of that at all the mind has its
own automatic protections and in
any case it was too late now   

  when the taxi drew up the house
was blazing with orange squares of
windows in the dusk there were
men on the porch and light glinted
on a police officers shield

  you kids wait here mr larkin
said uneasily dont get out of the
car

  the taxi driver shrugged and
pulled out a folded newspaper as mr
larkin hurried toward the porch in
the back seat jane spoke to bobby
her voice very soft

  you didnt she whispered it
was not even an accusation

  i dont care bobby whispered
back i was tired of that game i
wanted to play something else he

  giggled i won anyhow he de-
ciared

  how what happened

  the police came like i knew they
would he never thought of that so

i	won

  but how

  well it was sort of like the jun-
gle book shooting tigers remem-
ber they tied a kid to a stake and
when the tiger comes-bang only
the kids were all gone to santa bar-
bara and youd gone too so i used
granny i didnt think shed mind
she plays games with us a lot and
anvhow she was the only one left

  but bobby a kid doesnt mean a
kid like us it means a baby goat
and anyhow-

 oh bobby whispered oh-
well anyhow i thought granny
would be all right shes too fat to
run fast he grinned scornfully
hes dumb he said he should
have known the hunters always
come when you tie a kid out for the
tiger he doesnt know anything
when i told him id locked granny
in her room and nobody else was
around i thought he might guess
bobby looked crafty i was smart i
told him through the window i
thought he might think about me
being a kid but he didnt he went
right upstairs-fast lie even forgot
to limp i guess he was pretty hun-
gry by then bobby glanced toward
the swarming porch probly the po-
lice have got him now lie added
carelessly it was easy as pie i
won

  janes mind had not followed these
fancies

  is she dead she asked very
softly

  bobby looked at her the word had
a different meaning for him it had
no meaning beyond a phase in a
game and to his knowledge the
tiger had never harmed the tethered
kid

  mr larkin was coming back to the
taxi now walking very slowly and
not very straight
call him demon



  jane could not see his face   

it was hushed up of course as
much as possible the children
who knew so much more than those
who were shielding them were fu-
tilely protected from the knowledge
of what had happened as futilelv as
they in their turn had tried to pro-
tect their elders except for the two
oldest girls they didnt particularly
care the game was over granny
had had to go away on a long long
journey and she would never be
back

  they understood what that meant
well enough 

  the wrong uncle on the other
hand had had to go away too they
were told to a big hospital where he
would be taken care of all his life

  this puzzled them all a little for it
fell somewhat outside the limits of
their experience death thev under-
stood very imperfectly but this
other thing was completely mystify-
ing they didnt greatly care once
their interest faded though bobby
for some time listened to readings of
the jungle book with unusual at-
tention wondering if this time they
would take the tiger away instead of
killing him on the spot they never
did of course evidently in real life
tigers were different   

  for a loner time afterward in
nightmares janes perverse imagin-
ation dwelt upon and relived the
things she would not let it remember
when she was awake she would see
grannys bedroom as she had seen
it last the starched curtains billow-
ing the sunshine the red china shoe
the doll pin-cushion granny rub-
bing cold cream into her wrinkled
hands and looking up more and more
nervously from time to time as the
long avid waves of hunger pulsed
through the house from the thing in
its dreadful hollow place down below

  it must have been very hungry
the wrong uncle pretending to a
wrenched ankle downstairs must

have shifted and turned upon the
couch that hollow man empty and
blind of everything but the need for
sustenance the one red food he could
not live without the emptv automa-

  it had been very wise of bobby to
speak through the window when he
delivered his baited message

  upstairs in the locked room
granny must have discovered pres-
ently that she could not get out her
fat mottled fingers slippery from
cold-creaming must have tugged
vainly at the knob

  jane dreamed of the sound of
those footsteps many times the
tread she had never heard was loud-
er and more real to her than any
which had ever sounded in her ears
she knew very surely how they must
have come bounding up the stairs
thump thump thump two steps at a
time so that granny would look up
in alarm knowing it could not be the
tfncle with his wrenched ankle she
would have jumped up then her
heart knocking thinking wildly of
burglars

  it cant have lasted long the steps
would have taken scarcely the length
of a heartbeat to come down the hall
and by now the house would be
shaking and pulsing with one trium-
phant roar of hunger almost ap-
peased the thumping steps would
beat in rhythm to it the long quick
strides coming with dreadful pur-
posefulness down the hall and then
the key clicking in the lock and
then-

  usually then jane awoke

jane told herself that many
times then and later she didnt see
bobby again very often and when
she did he had forgotten a great

christmas and he started to school
when he heard that the wrong
uncle had died in the asylum he had
had to think hard to remember who
they meant for to the younger chil-
dren the wrong uncle had never
been a member of the family only a
part in a game they had played and
won

  gradually the nameless distress
which had once pervaded the house-
hold faded and ceased it was strong-
est most desperate in the days just
after grannys death but everyone
attributed that to shock when it
died away they were sure

  by sheer accident bobbys cold
limited logic had been correct rug-
gedo would not have been playing
fair if he had brought still another
wrong uncle into the game and bob-
by had trusted him to observe the
rules he did observe them for they
were a law he could not break

 ruggedo and the wrong uncle
were parts of a whole indissolubly
bound into their cycle not until the
cycle had been successfully com-
pleted could the wrong uncle exten-

sion be retracted or the cord broken
so in the end ruggedo was helpless

  in the asylum the wrong uncle
slowly starved he would not touch
what they offered he knew what he
wanted but they would not give him
that the head and the body died to-
gether and the house that had been
grandmother keatons was peaceful
once more

  if bobby ever remembered no one
knew it he had acted with perfect
logic limited only by his experience
if you do something sufficiently bad
the policeman will come and get you
and he was tired of the game only
his competitive instinct kept him
from simply quitting it and playing
something else

  as it was he wanted to win-and
he had won

  no adult would have done what
bobby did-but a child is of a differ-
ent species by adult standards a
child is not wholly sane because of
the way his mind worked then-be-
cause of what he did and what he
wanted-

pans and i hope to jupiter it
doesnt work

  professor conrad took his fingers
off an electric cable and pushed back
the horn-rimmed specs which were
forever sliding down the steep arch
of his nose

  why he asked mildly
because youll break your neck
on it i said dourly pulling off the
thick leather glove with which i had
bepn trying to get a butt out of the
pack

  they said that to the wright
brothers marc conrad replied

  sure and they did-or a lot of
other lads did anyway i dont see
why it should work

  youve been working with me for
two years hank gamble conrad
said if you dont see it yet i cant
hope to explain it to you now at the
last minute

  oh i dont mean the gadget it-
self heck  built every circuit into
the blamed squirrel cage-designed
some myself electrically its im-
pressive enough

  i glowered at the thing which
looked like an oversized telephone
booth crammed with dials and con-
trols with lots of open space where
only bars or plexiglas held it to-
gether

  its the whole blasted theory of
time travel i said i dont believe
there is such a thing as time actu-
ally its just an invention of mans
so hell know when to meet a train
as a matter of fact im opposed to
time and to clocks they annoy me
professor conrad shook his head
time is not an artificial concept
hank its a dimension as einstein
said but jts more than that for
example you admit this planet
earth is moving do you not
yeah

  suppose i ask you to locate it for
me you can go to work with a map
of the solar system and try to find
it what do you find you find you
have an orbit not a point you can

give me its exact location for today
but tomorrow your answer is wrong
yesterday your answer was wrong
the planet has moved therefore
three dimensions are not enough to
locate the earth you must add the
additional dimension of time earth
is at such and such a position-
when do you see

  sure i said grinning with the
thought that i had him now and if
you eo back in time to the spot where
eavt-h was yesterday do you find it
no its in tomorrow so your whole
idea of traveling back in time is
screwy the earth keps moving
ahead you go back marc and it
wont be there

  ho smiled

  thats very clever hank but i
told you that time was more than a
dimension its a whole set of circum-
stances not an isolated phenomenon
i believe that if i go back in time i
move along a fixed spiral of events
and i will always find the earth
where it should be however that is
relatively easy to understand what
i intend to do is much more difficult
hank i propose to go into the fu-
ture

  oh fine in other words youre
going to a spot the earth hasnt even
reached yet and you expect to find
it there how can it be marc how
can it be there and here and every-
where else simultaneously

  if i knew that i wouldnt have to
go he said pushing back the specs
ive got a hunch mavbe no more
than that and youd b surprised
how many of the scientific miracles
have come out of nothing more than
a hunch youll have to take me on
faith hank-the same kind of faith
that made people give credence to
biblical miracles

  when you going

  tomorrow well need some sleep
and i want to invite some of my dis-
tinguished and skeptical colleagues
so i can watch their eyes bug out as
i disappear from sight youll have
find the sculptor

-

to be rested because youll be control-
ling this end

the time machine had an elabo-
rate set of controls inside it
could be adjusted according to pro-
fessor conrad to reach any point in
the past or future without marginal
error of more than eight hours it
had an automatic return device
which could be set for any length of
stay and on this end i could brine
it back with a magnetic coupler if 
thought an emergency warranted it

  i slept pretty well that night i al-
ways do even if im worried but in
the morning i tried once more

  look marc i said maybe
youd better let me go

  why he asked surprised

  well kid youre a great brain
and all that but youre not much
when it comes to the roug-and-tum-
ble and nobody knows what kind of
bug-eyed monsters youre liable to
run into where youre going

  he opened his eyes a little and the
specs slid down his nose and he made
a grab for them

  why hank he said punching
me i didnt know you cared

  skip it i muttered

  the savants and graybeards be-
gan to arrive and marc was in his
glory showing them through the lab
and explaining the brand-new time
machine and how it was supposed to
work the old boys were very elo-
quent humph was about the gist
of their conversation though some
asked questions in mathematical for-
mulas that rolled off me like the well-
known rain off the equally notorious
duck

  the lecture was finished finally
and marc showed the bunch to seats
which he had arranged in a semi-
circle around the machine there
were the presidents of three big uni-
versities the mayor of new york
two research geniuses-or is it
genii-from westinghouse and
general electric and a little dried-

up hunchback of a man who worked

in the basement of his brooklyn
home and was said to be closer to
creating a pocket-sized cyclotron
than any man alive

  they sat there watching and i
could tell that not a man of them be-
lieved the thing would work tt
put them in my camp because i didnt
either yet i wanted to toss them all
out

  but marc never turned a hair he
stepped up into the machine and be-
gan to set his dials

  i am going five hundred years
into the future he explained the
prograss of mankind should be so
stupendous in that time that we
should find it an amazing period
anything further into the future
might be beyond our capacities to
understand now gentlemen no
matter how long i stay in this world
of the futuiye even though it be
weeks months or years i will set
the machine for return to this same
day so that to you i will seem to
have been gone only perhaps a few
moments please watch closely

considering the fact that he
had never done this befoie and
so far as anybody knew he might
just be committing hara-kiri it was
amazing the surety he displayed

  i have a transcribing machine
he told them into which i will
speak to record my impressions as i
go unless something happens it
should give us a complete record of
my experiences all right hank im
ready

  i felt like the man at sing sing
when he pulls the switch but i
wasnt going to show marc conrad
that he wras tougher than i i walked
over to the big generator and yanked
down the knife switch

  the current built up and the gen-
erator whined up into the higher
octaves i could almost feel that co-
lossal magnetic field building up
around the squirrel cage conrads


wonder story annual

face seemed to waver as though seen
 through water i wondered if the
blamed thing warped space wouldnt
it warp this building right out into
the street the assemblage was lean-
ing forward staring

  then the machine began to fade
the field closed in and the flickering
got bad conrads face blurred and
everything ran together then it
was gone there was only the little
dais where it had stood

  a deep breath went out of those
scientists and every man turned to
stare at his neighbor my heart was
lurching around like a drunk and i
picked out a chair and sat down

  amazing said a professor
where do you suppose hes gone

  most astonishing illusion said
another he hopped up and passed
his arm through the space where the
machine had been no its not op-
tical hes gone

  better sit down doc i suggest-
ed before he comes back and runs
you over

  the professor wrent back to his
seat hed barely got there when the
flickering began again the machine
swam out of the mists and began to
take shape

  hes back someone whispered

  where is he

   i couldnt see marc the flickering
was beginning to clear and the ma-
chine to stand out sharply i leaned
forward and thought i saw some-
thing the flickering steadied and i
pulled the switch so that the mag-
netic field collapsed i ran forward
and pulled down the protecting bar
on the front

  a little trickle of blood edged
toward me conrad was in there
slumped in a heap like a bundle of
old rags there was blood all over
him

  good heavens said someone be-
hind me   

  i got my hands on him as gently
as i could and started to lift him
out

  hank his eyes opened dont
move me-im done bricks-fell on
me all-crushed-inside made it
hank five-five hundred years saw
the future all-on record-play it
so long    kid

  he was dead just like that thirty
seconds ago he had been right here
without a scratch on him and he had
gone five hundred years into the fu-
ture and come back crushed to death
it was too much for me to get all
at once i didnt feel anything

  i lifted him out carried him to
the couch the scientists clustered
around clucking the mayor bustled
to the phone and called the police

  this is murder he said firmly

  who- you going to arrest 
asked

  maybe you he said darkly
this is very funny

  the others milled around helpless-
ly i wiped marcs face and pushed
the glasses back on the bridge of his
nose i felt like a kid lost in a big de-
partment store i went back to the
machine there was blood on the
floor and i wiped it up then i saw
the other thing on the floor

  it was a bronze head i pulled it
out and held it in the light it was
marc

  whoever had done it was good it
was almost alive you expected him
to push the glasses back on his nose
and start to talk

  now where did that come from
the mayor demanded

  he had the mentality of a cop
anything unexplained annoyed him

  he apparently brought it back
with him one of the graybeards
said pulling his beard they were
beginning to be plenty scared now
who could have done it and so
quickly 

  you forget i reminded him
that he could have stayed there for
years and still come back here with-
in seconds after he left

  i reached in and turned on the
transcriber
find the sculptor	

  this is marc conrad it said

it gave me the creeps to hear his
voice again alive when he lay
there on the couch just slipped out
of life the gang stopped milling
around and crowded in close

  the room is fading out the rec-
ord said i see it as though through
water with the faces of all of you
rippling and running together and
slowly growing dark now it is all
black i could be stone-blind wait
there are flashes of light running
like quicksilver through the dark
streaks and comets of color there is
a sense of motion and of twisting
that does unpleasant things to my
stomach i hope i shant be sick does
this feeling of motion mean i am
moving in space as well as in pure
time it must be for as i told hank
yesterday there must be movement
through the three physical dimen-
sions as well as time if i am to meet
this planet elsewhere in the time
stream it is at a different point for
each point in time

  something just went by some-
thing enormous i cant even venture
a guess as to what it is though it
was glowing a dull red it might
have been quite bright perhaps a
star but it may be that i am moving
close to the speed of light

  the sickness is growing worse
and i feel very dizzy i wouldnt
want to 

  the voice failed and there was
only the scratch of the stylus hed
passed out all right nobody moved
they were frozen staring at the ma-
chine it scratched along for some
time then the voice came in

  better now must have fainted
we seem to be slowing down yes
the light is growing stronger heres
the flickering i see buildings   
holy smoke what buildings

  this is the future it can be noth-
ing else  the buildings are incred-
ible staggering monoliths soaring
up like mountains each is a needle

piercing the sky surrounded by
acres of green park no jamming no
congestion there are people stroll-
ing on the walks superb-looking
healthy people the men wear only
shorts the women little more yes
they see the machine theyre run-
ning toward it im going to open the
bar

  there was an empty scratching
again then conrads voice came
back sounding different it was
laughing happy

  im a hero these people know all
about me it is in their history books
that i made the first time trip in
nineteen-fifty-five so im a pioneer
the legend of the first time trip is
well preserved theres even a
bronze head of me here standing on
a stone base in a little park its old
-its been here for a long long time
apparently my own age wrill recog-
nize the importance of this discov-
ery

  the year here is twenty-four
hundred and fifty-five just five hun-
dred years past our time i couldnt
begin to touch on the scientific mar-
vels i have discovered but i shall
take notes and make as many sketch-
es as i can to bring home i shall be
very busy for the next few months
but ill try to get to the machine at
least once a day to report progress

  scratch scratch again then a
shorter report he was a hero all
right a legendary figure out of the
past the people were light-hearted
children freed of the curse of work
with nothing to do but throw parties
marc got around it wras as though
george washington should suddenly
return to new york of nineteen-
fifty-five wouldnt we throw him a
party though and take him around
and show him all the statues of him
and all the streets and squares and
cities and things named after him
well it was that way with marc
conrad

  then about the ninth day came
something different


wonder story annual

  theres a snake in this garden of
eden marc reported the people
are afraid of invasion somebodys
been raiding cities whether they
are pirates from another part of
earth just after women and loot or
are actually from another planet no-
body knows they come in so fast
that nobody can tell what their ships
are like they may be rocket strato-
sphere fliers or may actually be
space ships from outside earth but
theyve done a lot of looting and
burning and killing

  these new yorkers of twenty-
four-fifty-five are not fighters
theyre psychologically trained out
of the killing habit and these at-
tacks leave them bewildered and
frightened

  scratch scratch then marcs
voice came over hoarse and loud and
panting

  raid he gasped theyre
bombing the city now-or leveling
it with some kind of destructive ray
cant see the ships-too high-too
fast all these tremendous buildings
-crumpling tons and tons of stone
brick metal-pouring down bury-
ing everything the whole city is
being destroyed im getting out of
here ill bring back that bronze head
as proof 

he was gone leaving the ma-
chine open we heard sounds
then sounds such as we had never
heard before there was a horrible
screeching whine as of something
cleaving the air with unimaginable
speed then a mighty sustained roar
like niagara amplified a thousand
times far away there were crashes
and deep heavy vibrations almost
below the level of hearing

  this went on for tense minutes
then a metallic clang close by and
marcs voice hardly recognizable
weak distorted in agony

  got it he whispered im hurt
-wall collapsed im - coming
back-

  that was all i shut it off the men
were staring at me at the machine
at each-other they felt i knew as if
madness were stalking them in that
quiet room could they believe what
they had just heard

  i dont know what they belieyed
i didnt care i felt just then that i
had to do something or i would go
crazy myself emotion was boiling
up in me and boiling up until i had
to get rid of it or burst so i did
something which i suppose was
typically crazy i went back to my
room and got mv service revolver
then i came back and stepped into
the machine

  sure it was crazy what good wras
a revolver against atomic bombs or
rays which could bring down build-
ings bigger than the empire state
but the madness had got me and i
had to do something

  hey the mayor beefed what
are you doing

  he was too late i shut down the
bar turned the dials up five hundred
years and closed my switch id been
thoughtful enough to start the gen-
erator as i went past it i had to
trust the boys not to monkey with it
while i was gone

  the room swam out and things got
black i went through the same
blackness that marc had described
and i got just as sick but i didnt
pass out i saw the dark lighten and
the sun and sky swim back the ma-
chine stopped and i stood still and
looked out at death and destruction

  i dont know by how much id
missed marcs time here in the fu-
ture but the killers had come and
gone the city that marc had de-
scribed was a tumbled smashed
heap of rubble parts of the great
buildings still looked up but the
rubble had covered almost every-
thing with broken stone brick glass
and steel and nothing moved in all
that wilderness of wreckage it was
worse than hiroshima

  i lifted the bar and got out glass
find the sculptor



crunched underfoot i moved stiffly
like a man in a dream picking my
way over the heaps of rock which
had once been buildings i found a
way that was fairly clear and i fol-
lowed my nose there was utter si-
lence here not a voice not a scream
not a sound of bird or insect

  walking i came to a little triangu-
lar park where no rubble had fallen
the trees were untouched the grass
was green the flower-beds were
bright with color it was a stamp-
sized oasis in that terrible desert of
destruction and right in the middle
of it was a stone pedestal something
had been on top but it was empty
now i saw letters carved on the
stone

        marc conrad
 hero of the first successful flight
 through time from the year  to
  his courage and daring opened
 vast new horizons to release the earth-
 bound feet of man

  this was where his statue had
been the bronze bust had rested on
top of the stone here i put my hand
on it it was like a breath of marc
lying dead there in his room five
hundred years away

  this stone was very old the carv-
ing was dim and weather-beaten i
wondered how long it had been here
and all at once i felt horribly alone
and small and scared i was the only
living thing in this dead city for
endless miles aiound me the desola-
tion stretched only marc-his mem-
ory-and i stood here alone there
was nothing for me to do here i
turned and went back to the ma-
chine

on the return trip i missed by
six months maybe it was bum
navigating maybe there was that
much error in the machine anyway
when i got back there were two cops
on guard in the room and only one
of the graybeards

  we thought you were gone for

sure they told me

  i went to see i said every
word he recorded was true i saw
that city he described-wiped out
every living thing buried i saw the
monument put up for him am i un-
der arrest

  i guess not the cop said uncom-
fortably

  we were talking about putting
up a memorial to you too the gray-
beard said marc conrad was a
hero and we were making up our
minds about you come and let us
show you

  they took me in a car and brought
me to a brand-new park it was
small and triangular with young
trees planted around it and flower-
beds bright with color and in the
center was a stone pedestal with
carving on it on top was the bronze
head of marc conrad

  i felt a little cold touch of fear i
was afraid to go up and look at it
but i moved my legs and made them
take me there and i read

        marc conrad
 hero of the first successful flight
 through time from the year  to
  his courage and daring opened
 vast new horizons to release the earth
 bound feet of man

  it was the same i had just touched
this stone five hundred years old in
the future now i was touching it
brand-new with the carving in it
still fresh and bright but there was
something worse i lifted my eyes to
the bronze head

  this-this head i croaked
this is the one marc brought
back 

  yes they told me

  then where did it come from i
shouted

  they stared at me

  look i said getting a grip on
my sanity marc went into the fu-
ture he found this park just as you
see it here the stone pedestal was
here the bronze head on top he took
	wonder story annual

the head off and brought it back so
you make the park and make the
pedestal and put the bronze on top
but who made the head 

  they looked at me and i felt things
start to swim again

  dont you see i begged
theres something missing the
sculptor is missing marc had to
bring his bronze back from the fu-
ture in order for you to put it here
so he could go into the future and
find it waiting for him but where
did it come from where in that
time link is the man avho made it
dont you see that theres a piece
missing from the time cycle

  they saw what i meant all right
but they hadnt seen that park in the
future as i had so they had the
choice of believing or not believing
me to protect their own sanity they
chose not to believe me

  i didnt have that choice i had
seen the park i knew that marc had
brought that head back from the fu-
ture into the past so it could be put
in place and stay there and wait for

him to go into the future again and
find it and the whole crazy cycle
was going round and round in time
forever just as it was going round
and round in my head

  im not doing much these days
im just sitting and thinking im
wondering how this city will change
in the next five hundred years grow
into a magnificent place of monoliths
and parks and then suddenly a
strange machine will come out of the
past and marc conrad will be here
again-though he is dead and has
been dead five hundred years

  marc will stay nine days and take
the head and go back to the past
back with his crushed ribs to die
and then ill come here again
though i too will have been dead a
long time and presently follow marc
back to find them putting up the
pedestal in the new little park and
once again that maddening cycle will
begin to go on and on forever as
long as time spins its threads

  i sit here and think about it and
wonder if i will go mad

thing to them theyd stood in line
to get into our tent and push their
coins into the machines so even
with the plenty high expense of the
trip wed done all right by ourselves

  yes they were right comforting
those figures ma was entering
course shed add them up wrong
but then ellen would straighten it
out when ma finally gave up ellens
good at figures and got a good one
herself even if i do say it of my own
daughter credit for that goes to
ma anyway not to me im built on
the general lines of a space tug

  i put back the coin-box of the
rocket race and looked up ma i
started to say then the door of the
pilots compartment opened and john
lane stood there ellen across the
table from ma put down her book
and looked up too she was all eyes
and they were shining

  johnny saluted smartly the regu-
lation salute with which a private-
ship pilot is supposed to honor the
owner and captain of the ship it al-
ways got under my skin that salute
but i couldnt talk him out of it be-
cause the rules said he should do it

  he said object ahead captain
wherry

  object i queried what kind
of object

  you see from johnnys voice and
johnnys face you couldnt guess
whether it meant anything or not
mars city polytech trains em to be
strictly deadpan and johnny had
graduated magna cum laude hes a
nice kid but hed announce the end of
the world in the same tone of voice
hed use to announce dinner if it
was a pilots job to announce dinner

  it seems to be a planet sir was
all he said

  quite a while it took for his words
to sink in

  a planet i asked not particu-
larly brilliantly i stared at him
hoping that hed been drinking or
something not because i had any
objections to his seeing a planet

sober but because if johnny ever
unbent to the stage of taking a good
drink the alky would probably dis-
solve some of the starch out of his
backbone then id have someone to
swap stories with it gets lonesome
traveling through space with two
women and a conscientious polytech
grad who follows the rules

  a planet sir an object of plane-
tary dimensions i should say dia-
meter three thousand miles distance
two million course apparently an
orbit about sirius a

  johnny t began were inside
the orbit of thor which is sirius i
which means its the first planet of
sirius and how can there be a planet
inside of that you wouldnt be kid-
ding me johnny

  you may inspect the teleplate
sir and check my calculations he
replied stiffly

  well i got up and went into the
pilots compartment there was a
disc in the center of the teleplate all
right so johnny wasnt seeing
things checking his calculations
was something else again my mathe-
matics end at counting coins out of
coin machines but i was willing to
take his word for it

  johnny i almost shouted
weve discovered a new planet aint
that something

  yes sir he commented in his
usual matter-of-fact voice

it was something but not much
i mean the sirius system hasnt
been colonized long and it wasnt too
surprising that a little three thou-
sand mile planet hadnt been noticed
yet especially as the orbits swing
high wide and handsome on thor
and freda so far out theyd be
colder than pluto if the dog star
wasnt twenty-six times as bright
as sol

  there hadnt been room for ma
and ellen to follow us into the pilots
compartment but they stood looking
in at the doorway and i moved to
nothing sirius



one side so they could see the disc
in the viewplate

  how soon do we get there john-
ny ma wanted to know

  our point of nearest approach on
this course will be within an hour
mrs wherry he replied we come
within half a million miles of it
oh do we i wanted to know
unless sir you think it advis-
able to change course and give it
more clearance

  i gave clearance to my throat in-
stead and looked at ma and ellen
and saw it would be okay by them
johnny i continued were going
to give it less clearance ive always
hankered to see a new planet all to
myself were going to land there
he said yes sir and saluted
but there was i thought disapproval
in his eyes oh hed have had cause
for it if there had been you never
know what youll run into bursting
into virgin territory out here a
cargo of canvas and slot-machines
isnt the proper equipment for ex-
ploring now is it 

  but the perfect pilot never ques-
tions an owners orders doggone
him johnny sat down and started
punching keys on the calculator and
we eased out to let him do it

ma i said im a blamed fool
you would be if you werent
she came back i grinned when i got
that sorted out and looked at ellen

  but she wasnt looking at me she
had that dreamy look in her eyes
again it made me want to go into
the pilots compartment and take a
poke at johnny to see if it would
wake him up

  listen honey i said that
johnny-

  but something burned the side of
my face and i knew it was ma looking
at me so i shut up i got out a deck
of cards and played solitaire until
we landed

  johnny popped out of the pilots
compartment and saluted

  landed sir atmosphere one-oh-

sixteen on the gauge

  and what ellen asked does
that mean in english

  its breatheable miss wherry a
bit high in nitrogen and low in oxy-
gen compared to earth air but
nevertheless breatheable

  he was a caution that young man
was when it came to being precise

  then what are we waiting for
i wanted to know

  your orders sir

  shucks with my orders johnny
lets get the door open and get
going

  he saluted and we got the door
open that was that johnny stepped
out first strapping on a pair of heat-
ojectors as he went the rest of us
were right behind him

outside it was cool but not cold
the landscape looked just like
thor with bare rolling hills of hard-
baked greenish clay there was
plant life a brownish bushy stuff
that looked something like tumble-
weed

  i took a look up to gauge the time
and sirius was almost at the zenith
which meant johnny had landed us
smack in the middle of the dav side

  got any idea johnny i asked
what the period of rotation is

  i had time for only a rough check
sir it came out twenty-one hours
seventeen and a half minutes
rough check he had said

 ma answered thats rough
enough for us gives us time for a
walk and what are we waiting for
for the ceremony ma i told
her we got to name the place
dont we and where did you put
that bottle of champagne we were
saving for my birthday i reckon
this is a more important occasion
she told me where and i went and
got it

  got any suggestions for a name
johnny i asked you saw it first
no sir

  i said trouble is that thor and


wonder story annual

freda are wrong now i mean thor
is sirius i and freda is sirius ii and
this orbit is inside theirs so they
ought to be two and three respec-
tively or else this ought to be sirius
 which means its nothing sirius
ellen smiled and i think johnny
would have except that it would have
been undignified while ma just
grunted william- she began and
would have gone on in that vein if
something hadnt happened

  something looked up over the top
of the nearest hill ma was the only
one facing that way and she let out
a whoop and grabbed me then we
all turned and looked it was the
head of something that looked like
an ostrich only it must have been
bigger than an elephant also there
was a collar and a blue polka-dot bow
tie around the thin neck of the crit-
ter and it wore a hat the hat was
bright yellow and had a long purple
feather the thing looked at us a
minute quizzically and then pulled
its head back

  none of us said anything for a
minute and then i took a deep
breath

  that i said tears itplanet i
dub thee nothing sirius

  i bent down and hit the cham-
pagne bottle against the clay but it
just dented the clay and wouldnt
break t tried again and looked
around for a rock to hit it on there
wasnt any rock

  i took out a corkscrew from my
pocket and opened the bottle instead
we all had a drink except johnny
who doesnt drink or smoke me i
had a good long one then i poured
a brief libation on the ground and
recorked the bottle i had a hunch
i might need it again and maybe
need it worse than the planet did
there was lots of whisky in the ship
and some martian greenbrew but
no more champagne

  i said well here we go

  i caught johnnys eye and he said
do you think it wise sir in view of

the fact that there are-uh-
inhabitants 

  inhabitants i interrupted him
johnny whatever that thing that
stuck its head over the hill was it
wasnt an inhabitant and if it pops
up again ill conk it with this bottle
but just the same before we
started out i went inside the chit-
terling and got a couple more heato-
jectors i stuck one in my belt and
gave ellen the other ellens a better
shot than i am but ma couldnt hit
the side of an administration build-
ing at ten paces with a spraygun so
i didnt give her one

e started off and sort of by
mutual consent we went the
other direction from where wed
seen the whatever-it-was the hills
all looked alike for a while and as
soon as we were over the first one
we were out of sight of the chitter-
ling i noticed johnny looking at his
wrist-compass every couple of min-
utes and knew hed know the way
home

  nothing happened for three hills
and then ma said look and we
looked

  about twenty yards off to our left
there was a purple bush there was
a buzzing sound coming from it the
buzzing sound came from a lot of
things that were flying around the
bush they looked like birds until
you looked a second time and then
you saw that their wings werent
moving but they zoomed up and
down and around just the same i
tried to look at their heads but
where their heads ought to be there
was just a blur a circular blur

  they got propellers ma said
like old-fashioned airships used to
have

  it did look that way

  i looked at johnny and he looked at
me and we started over toward that
bush but the birds or whatever
flew away quick the minute we took
a step they skimmed off low to the
nothing sirius



ground and were out of sight in a
minute

  we started off again none of us
saying anything and ellen came up
and walked alongside me we were
just far enough ahead to be out of
earshot and she said pop-

  and didnt go on with it until i
answered what kid

  nothing she replied sorrowful-
like skip it

  so of course i knew what shed
wanted to talk about but i couldnt
think of anything helpful to say ex-
cept to cuss out mars polytech and
that wouldnt have done any good
mars polytech has one trouble only
its too darned good for its own
good and so are its ramrods of
graduates after a dozen years or so
outside though some of them man-
age to unbend and limber up

  but johnny hadnt been out that
long by eleven years or so the
chance to pilot the chitterling had
been a break for him of course as
his first job a few years with us
and hed be qualified to skipper some-
thing bigger hed qualify to jump
up there a lot faster than if hed
had to start in as a minor officer on
a bigger ship

  only trouble was that he was too
good-looking and didnt know it he
didnt know anything they hadnt
taught him at polytech and all theyd
taught him there was math and as-
trogation and how to salute and
they hadnt taught him how not to

  ellen- i started to say

  yes pop

  uh-nothing skip it i hadnt
meant to say that at all but suddenly
she grinned at me and i grinned
back and it was just like wed talked
the whole thing over true we hadnt
got anywhere but then we wouldnt
have even if we had if you know
what i mean and i dont think you
do

  so just then we came to the top of
a small rise and ellen and i stopped
because just ahead of us was the

blank end of a paved street

  an ordinary every day plasti-
paved street just like youd see in
any city on earth with curb and
sidewalk and gutters and the painted
traffic-line down the middle only it
ran out to nowhere where we stood
and at least until it went over the
top of the next rise there wasnt a
house or a vehicle or a creature on it

  i looked at ellen and she looked at
me and then we both looked at ma
and johnny lane who had just
caught up to us i said what is it
johnny

  it seems to be a street sir

he caught the look i was giving
him and flushed a little he bent
over and examined the paving
closely and when he straightened up
his eyes were even more surprised
i queried well what is it caramel
icing

  its permaplast sir we arent the
discoverers of this planet because
that stuffs an earth product
um i sort of mumbled couldnt
the natives here have discovered the
same process the same-uh-in-
gredients might be available

  yes sir but the blocks are trade-
marked if youll look closely

  i replied couldnt the natives
have- then i shut up because even
i saw how silly that was but its
tough to think your party has dis-
covered a new planet and then have
earth-trademarked paving bricks on
the first street you come to but
whats a street doing here at all
i wanted to know

  theres only one way to find out
said ma so what are we standing
here for

  so we pushed on and on the next
rise we saw a building a two-story
red brick with a sign on it that read
bon ton restaurant it was in old
english script lettering

  i said ill be a- but ma clapped
her hand over my mouth before i
could finish which was maybe just


wonder story annual

as well for what id been going to
say had been quite inadequate there
was the building only a hundred
yards ahead facing us at a sharp
turn in the street

  i started walking faster and i got
there first by a few paces i opened
the door and started to walk in
then i stopped cold on the doorstep
because there wasnt any in to that
building it was a false front like a
cinema setting and all you could see
through the door was more of those
rolling greenish hills

  i stepped back and looked up at
the bon-ton restaurant sign and
the others walked up and looked in
the doorway which id left open
they came back and we just stood
there until ma got impatient and
said well what are you going to
do

  what do you want me to do i
wanted to know go in and order
you a lobster dinner with cham-
pa-hey i forgot

  the champagne bottle was still in
my jacket pocket and i took it out
and passed it to ma first and then to
ellen and then i finished what was
left of it and i drank it too fast be-
cause the bubbles tickled my nose
and made me sneeze

  i felt ready for anything though
and i took another walk through the
doorway of the building that wasnt
there maybe i figured i could see
some sign of how recently it had been
put up or something but there
werent any signs that i could see
the inside-or rather the back of
the front if you know what im talk-
ing about was smooth and plain like
a sheet of glass it looked like a syn-
thetic of some sort

  i took a look around at the ground
back of it but all i could see were
a few holes that looked like insect
holes and thats what they must
have been because there was a big
black cockroach sitting or standing
because how can you tell whether a
cockroach is sitting or standing

by one of them i took a step closer
and he popped down the hole

  i felt a little better as i went front
through the doorway i said ma
i saw a cockroach and you know
what was peculiar about it
what said ma

  nothing i told her thats the
peculiar thing there was nothing
peculiar here the ostriches wear
hats and the birds have propellers
and the streets go nowhere and the
houses havent any backs to them
but that cockroach didnt even have
feathers

  are you sure ellen wanted to
know

  sure im sure well lets take the
next rise and see whats over it

  we went and we saw down in
between that hill and the next the
road took another sharp turn and
facing us was the front view of a
tent with a big banner that said
penny arcade

this time i didnt even break
stride i said they copied that
banner from the show sam heide-
man used to have remember sam
and the old days ma

  that drunken no-good asked
ma

  why you liked him too ma
yes and i liked you but that
doesnt prove that you arent or that
he isnt-

  why ma i interrupted but by
that time we were right in front of
the tent looked like real canvas be-
cause it billowed gently i said i
havent got the heart who wants to
look through this time

 but ma already had her head
through the flap of the tent i heard
her say why hello sam you old
soak

  i said ma quit kidding or ill-
but by that time i was past her and
inside the tent and it was a tent all
four sides of one and a good big one
at that and it was lined with the old
familiar coin machines there count-
nothing sirius



ing coins in the change booth was
sam heideman looking up with al-
most as much surprise on his face as
there must have been in mine

  he said pop wherry ill be a
dirty name only he didnt say
dirty name-but he didnt get
around to apologizing to ma and
ellen for that until he and i had
pounded each others backs and then
hed shaken hands around and been
introduced to johnny lane

  it was just like old times on the
mars and venus carney lots he was
telling ellen how shed been just
so high when hed seen her last
and did she reallv remember him
and then ma sniffed

  when ma sniffs like that theres
something to look at and i got my
eyes off good old sam and looked at
ma and then at where ma was look-
ing i didnt sniff but i gasped

 a woman was coming forward
from somewhere in the back of the
tent and when i call her a woman
its because i cant think of the right
word if there is one she was st
cecilia and guinevere and a petty
girl all ironed into one she was like
a sunset in new mexico and the cold
silver moons of mars seen from the
equatorial gardens she was like a
venusian valley in the spring and
like dorzalski playing the violin she
was really something

  i heard another gasp from along-
side of me and it was an unfamiliar
note took me a second to realize
why it was unfamiliar id never
heard johnny lane gasp before

  it was an effort but i shifted my
eyes for a look at his face and i
thought oh-oh poor ellen for
the poor boy was gone now no ques-
tion about it

  and just in time-maybe seeing
johnny helped me-i managed to
remember that im pushing fifty and
happily married i took hold ofcmas
arm and hung on

  sam i said who on ea-on
whatever planet this is-

  sam turned around and looked be-
hind him he said miss ambers
id like you to meet some old friends
of mine just dropped in mrs wher-
ry this is miss ambers the movie
star	t

  then he finished the introductions
first ellen then me and then john-
ny ma and ellen were too polite
me i maybe went the other way by
pretending not to notice the hand
miss ambers held out old as i am
i had a hunch i might forget to let
it go if i took it thats the kind of
a girl she was

  johnny did forget

  sam was saying pop you old
pirate what are you doing here i
thought you stuck to the colonies
where youd get a play and i sure
didnt look for you to drop in on a
movie set

  a movie set i said things be-
gan to make sense almost

  sure planetary cinema inc
with me as technical adviser on car-
ney scenes they wanted inside
shots of a penny arcade so i just
brought my old stuff out of storage
and set it up all the boys are over
at the base camp now

t ight was just beginning to dawn
on me and that restaurant
front up the street thats a set
i queried

  sure and the street itself they
didnt need it but they had to film
the making of it for one sequence
oh i went on but how about
the ostrich with the bow tie and the
birds with the propellers  they
couldnt have been movie props or
could they id heard that plane-
tary cinema inc did some pretty
impossible things

  sam shook his head a bit blank-
ly nope you must have seen some
of the local fauna there are a few
but not many and they dont get in
that way

  ma said look here sam heide-
man how come if this planet has


wonder story annual

been discovered we hadnt heard
about it how long has it been
known and whats it all about

  man named wilkins discovered
this planet ten years ago sam
chuckled reported it to the coun-
cil but before it got publicized
planetary cinema got wind of it and
offered the council a whooping rental
for the place on the condition that
its existence be kept secret as there
arent any minerals or anything of
value here and the soil aint worth a
whoop the council rented it to them
on those terms

  but why secret 

  no visitors no distractions not
to mention the jump on their com-
petitors all the big movie compan-
ies spy on one another and swipe
each others ideas you should know
that by now here they got all the
space they want and can work in
peace and privacy

  whatll they do about us finding
the place  wanted to know

  sam chuckled again guess theyll
entertain you royally now that
youre here and try to persuade you
to keep it under your hat youll
probably get a free pass for life to
all the planetary cinema theaters
too

  he went over to a cabinet and
came back with a tray of bottles and
glasses ma and ellen declined but
sam and i had a couple apiece and
it was good stuff johnny and miss
ambers were over in a corner of the
tent whispering together so earnest-
ly that we didnt bother them espe-
cially when i told sam that johnny
didnt drink

  johnny still had hold of her hand
and was gazing into her eyes like a
sick pup i noticed ellen moved
around so she was looking the other
way and didnt have to watch i felt
sorry for her but there wasnt any-
thing i could do something like that
just happens if it happens and if
id been johnnys age and it hadnt
been for ma-

  but i saw ma was getting im-
patient and edgy and after a few
yarns back and forth i said wed
better get back to the ship and get
dressed up if we were due to be
entertained royally then wed move
the ship in closer i reckoned we
could spare a few days on nothing
sirius i left sam in stitches by tell-
ing him how and why wed named
the planet that after a look at the
local fauna

  then i gently pried johnny loose
from the movie star and led him out-
side it wasnt easy there was a
blank blissful expression on his face
and hed even forgotten to salute me
when id spoken to him he hadnt
called me sir either in fact he
didnt say anything at all

  neither did any of the rest of us
walking up the street

  there was something knocking at
my mind and i couldnt figure out
what it was there was something
wrong something that didnt make
sense

  ma was worried too finally i
heard her say pop is sam right
about them entertaining us i mean
if they really want to keep this place
a secret wouldnt they maybe-

  no they wouldnt i answered
maybe a bit snappishly that wasnt
what i was worried about though

  i looked down at that new and per-
fect road and there was something
about it i didnt like i diagonaled
over to the curb and walked along
that looking down at the greenish
soil beyond but there wasnt much
to see except more holes and more
bugs like the one id seen back at
the bon ton restaurant

  maybe they werent cockroaches
unless the cinema company had
brought them but they were near
enough like cockroaches for all prac-
tical purposes

  ant they still didnt have propel-
lers or wheels or bow-ties or feath-
ers they were just plain cock-
roaches
nothing sirius



  i stepped off the paving and tried
to step on one or two of them but
they got away and got down holes
they were plenty fast and shifty on
their feet

  i got back on the road and walked
with ma when she asked what
were you doing i answered
nothing

ellen was walking along not
talking and keeping her face a
studious blank i could guess what
she was thinking and i wished that
something could be done about it
the only thing i could think of was
to decide to stay on earth a while
at the end of this trip and give her
a chance to get over johnny by
meeting a lot of other young sprigs
maybe even finding one she liked

  johnny was walking along in a
daze he was gone all right and
hed fallen with awful suddenness
like guys like that always do oh
maybe it wasnt love but was just in-
fatuation but right now he probably
didnt know what planet he was on

  we were over the first rise now
out of sight of sams tent

  pop did you see any movie cam-
eras around  ma asked suddenly

  nope but those things cost mil-
lions they dont leave them setting
around loose when theyre not being
used

  ahead of us was the front of that
restaurant it looked funny as the
devil from a side view walking
toward it from this direction noth-
ing in sight but that and green clay
hills and the crazy street we were
walking on

  there werent any cockroaches on
the street seemed as though they
never got up on it or crossed it

  when i spoke to johnny he didnt
seem to hear me and i decided not
to say it because i didnt know what
i was going to say there was still
that something knocking at my
mind something that made less
sense than anything else

  it got stronger and stronger and
it was driving me crazy the whole
thing seemed more insane than ab-
surd i got to wishing i had an-
other drink sirius a was getting
down toward the horizon but it was
still plenty hot

  i even began to wish i had a drink
of water ma looked tired too lets
stop for a rest were about halfway
back i said to her

  we stopped it was right in front
of the bon ton and i looked up at
the sign and grinned johnny will
you go in and order dinner for us
i asked our precise young man

  he saluted and replied yes sir
then started for the door he sudden-
ly got kind of red in the face and
stopped i chuckled but i didnt rub
it in by saying anything else

  ma and ellen sat down on the curb

  i walked around back of the res-
taurant front and it hadnt changed
any smooth like glass on the other
side the same cockroach was still
by the same hole

   i said hello there but it didnt
answer so i tried to step on it but
it was too fast for me i noticed
something funny it started for the
hole the second i decided to step on
it even before i had actually moved
a muscle

  i went around to the front again
andjeaned up against the brick wall
it was nice and solid to lean against

  i took a cigar out of my pocket and
started to light it but i dropped the
match almost i knew what was
wrong

  something about sam heideman

  ma i said and she turned and
looked up at me

  ma isnt sam heideman d-

  and then with utterly appalling
suddeness i wasnt leaning against
a wall any more because the wall
just wasnt there and i was falling
backward

  i picked myself up off the greenish
clay ma and ellen were getting up
too from sitting down hard on the
	wonder story annual

ground because the curb theyd been
sitting on wasnt there any more
either

there wasn a sign of the street
wed been walking on or of the
bon ton restaurant id been leaning
against there wasnt anything but
greenish hills like wed first seen
from the door of the chitterling

   that fall had jolted me plenty and
 i was mad i wanted something to
 take out my mad on and t looked
 around to see if my friend the cock-
 roach had gone up in smoke along
 with the wall and street he hadnt

 i tried for him again and missed
 again	

   then i looked around at the oth-
 ers ma looked as mad as i felt
 she was rubbing herself where
 shed landed on the ground johnny
 looked startled and like he wanted
 to cuss but didnt know how

   ellen didnt look anything she
 just looked down at where the street
 ought to be and over toward me and
 where the bon ton ought to be then
 back toward where wed come from
 as though wondering whether the
 tent was still back there

    it isnt i said

   ma asked it isnt what

   isnt there i explained

   ma glowered at me what isnt
where

   the tent i went on a bit peeved
 the movie company the whole
 shebang and especially sam heide-
 man it was when i remembered
 about sam that the street went out
 from under us

   remembered what about sam
hes dead dont you remember
six years ago in new york when we
were reading some old copies of in-
terplanetary variety and came
across his obit sam heidemans
dead so he wasnt there none of it
was there and the minute i realized
that they pulled it out from under
us

   they what do you mean they

 pop wherry  who is they 

   you mean who are they i said
 but the look ma gave me made me
 wince lets not talk here i went
 on lets get back to the ship as
 quick as we can first you can lead
 us there johnny without the
 street

   he nodded forgetting to salute or
 sir me we started off none of us
 talking

   after we got to where the end of
 the street had been we could see
 our footprints and the oing was
 easy we passed the rise where the
 purple bush had been that the birds
 with propellers had been flying
 around but the birds werent there
 now neither was the purple bush

   i had a pretty good hunch too
 that we wouldnt see any more ele-
 phant-sized ostriches in bow ties
 we didnt

   but the chitterling was there
thank heaven we saw it from the
last rise and it was just as wed
left it it looked like home and we
started to walk faster

   i opened the door and stood aside
 for ma and ellen to go in first ma
 had just got her foot on the first
 rung when we heard the voice it
 said we bid you farewell

i looked around-all of us looked
around-but there wasnt any-
body or anything doing the talking
well there hadnt been any street
either or one-sided restaurant or
proneller-birds

   we bid you farewell too and the
 hell with you i answered letting
 em know i meant it

   i motioned to ma to go on into the
 ship the sooner i was out of this
 place the better id like it

   but the voice said wait and
 there was something about it that
 made us wait we wish to explain
 so you will not return

  nothing had been further from
my mind but i said why not

   your civilization is not compati-
nothing sirius



 ble with ours we have studied your
 minds to make sure we projected
 images from images we found in your
 minds to study your reactions to
 them our first images our thought
 projections were confused but we
 understood your minds well by the
 time you reached the farthest point
 of your walk we were able to project
 beings similar to yourselves

  sam heideman yeah i said
but how about the da-the woman 
she couldnt have been in the mem-
ory of any of us because we didnt
know her

  she was a composite-what you
would call an idealization that
however does not matter by studv-
ing you we learned that your civili-
zation concerns itself with things
ours with thoughts neither of us
has anything to offer the other no
good could come through interchange
whereas much harm might our
planet has no material resources that
would interest your race

  i had to agree to that looking out
over that monotonous rolling green
clay it supported those tumbleweed-
like bushes a few of them but didnt
look as though it would raise any-
thing else as for minerals i hadnt
even seen a pebble

  right you are i shouted back
any planet that raises nothing but
tumbleweeds and cockroaches can
keep itself as far as we are con-
cerned so- then something
dawned on me iley just a minute
there must be something else be-
sides weeds and roaches or who the
hell am i talking to

  you are talking replied the
voice to what you call cockroaches
which is another point of incompati-
bility between us to be more precise
you are talking to a thought-project-
ed voice but we are projecting it
and let me assure you of one thing
that you are as physically repugnant
to us as we are to you

  i looked down then and saw them
three of them ready to pop in holes

if i made a move back inside the
ship i said johnny blast off

  he saluted and said yes sir
and went into the pilots compart
ment and shut the door his face had
been studiously blank he didnt
come out until we were on auto-
matic course with sirius just a dwin-
dling star behind us ellen had gone
to her room ma and i were playing
cribage

  may i go off duty sir johnny
asked and walked stiffly to his room
when i answered sure

  after a while ma and i turned in
a while after that we heard the
noises i got up to investigate

  i came back grinning every-
things okay ma i said its john-
ny hes as drunk as a hootowl
whats wonderful about johnny
getting drunk are you

  no i admitted regretfully may-
be but ma-he told me to go to
blazes and without saluting me
the owner of the ship

  ma just looked at me sometimes
women are smart but sometimes
theyre pretty dumb

  listen he isnt going to keep on
getting drunk this is just an occa-
sion cant you see what happened
to his pride and his dignity

  you mean because he-
because he fell in love with the
thought projection of a cockroach
i pointed out or thought he did
he has to get drunk once to forget
that and from now on after he
sobers up hes going to be human
ill bet on it and ill bet too that
once hes human hes going to see
ellen and realize how pretty she is
ill even bet hes head-over-heels
before we get back to earth

  if youre right-

  i am right i told her gleefully
ill get a bottle and well drink a
toast to it to nothing sirius
and for once i was right johnny
and ellen were engaged before we
got near enough to the solar system
to start decelerating	  
at first she wanted a household pet
then she decided that 

jerry is

dont blame the martians
the human race would have
developed plasto-biology in
any case look at the older regis-
tered kennel club breeds-glandular
giants like the st bernard and the
great dane silly little atrocities like
the chihuahua and the pekingese
consider fancy goldfish

  the damage was done when dr
morgan produced new breeds of
fruit flies by kicking around their
chromosomes with x-rays after
that the second generation of the
hiroshima survivors did not teach
us anything new those luckless
monstrosities only publicized what

a novelet

was standard genetic knowledge

mr and mrs bronson van vogel
did not have social reform in mind
when they went to the phoenix
breeding ranch mr van vogel sim-
ply wanted to buy a pegasus he had
mentioned it at breakfast

are you tied up this morning my
dear

not especially why

id like to run out to arizona and
order a pegasus designed

a pegasus a flying horse why
my sweet

he grinned just for fun pudgy
hartmann was around the club yes-
terday with a six-legged dachshund
a man

by robert a henlein

 -must have been over a yard long
 it was clever but he swanked so
 much i want to give him something
 to stare at imagine martha-land-
 ing on the club copter platform on a
 winged horse thatll snap his eyes
 back

   she turned her eyes from the jer-
 sey shore to look indulgently at her
 husband she was not fooled this
 would be expensive but brownie
 was such a dear

   when do we start

  they landed two hours earlier

than they started the airsign read
in letters fifty feet high

phoenix breeding ranch
controlled genetics-licensed labor
contractors

   labor contractors she read
i thought this place was used just
to burbank new animals

  they both design and produce
he explained importantly they dis-
tribute through the mother corpora-
tion workers you ought to know
you own a big chunk of workers
common

  you mean i own a bunch of apes
really

  perhaps i didnt tell you haskell
and i- he leaned forward and in-
formed the field that he would land
manually he was a bit proud of his
piloting

  he switched off the robot and add-
ed briefly as his attention was taken
up by herding the ship down has-
kell and i have been plowing your
general atomics dividends back into
workers inc good diversification-
still plenty of dirty work for the an-
thropoids to do he slapped the
keys the scream of the nose jets
stodped conversation

  bronson had called the manager in
flight they were met-not with red
carpet canopy and footmen though
the manager strove to give that im-
pression

  mr van vogel and mrs van
vogel we are honored indeed

  he ushered them into a tiny lux-
urious unicar they jeeped off the
field up a ramp and into the lobby
of the administration building the
manager mr blakeslv did not relax
until he had seated them around a
fountain inthe lounge of his offices
struck cigarettes for them and pro-
vided tall cool drinks

bronson van vogel was

bored by the attention as it was
obviously inspired by his wifes dun
 bradstreet rating ten stars a sun-
burst and heavenly music he pre-

ferred people who could convince
him that he had invented the briggs
fortune instead of marrying it

  this is business blakesly ive
an order for you

  so well our facilities are at
your disposal what would you like
sir

  i want you to make me a pe-
gasus

  a pegasus a flying horse
  exactly

  blakesly pursed his lips you
seriously want a horse that will fly
an animal like the mythical pe-
gasus

  yes yes-thats what i said
you embarrass me mr van
vogel i assume you want a unique
gift for your lady how gout a mid-
get elephant twenty inches high
perfectly housebroken and able to
read and write he holds the stylus
in his trunk-very cunning

  does he talk demanded mrs
van vogel

  well now my dear lady his voice
box you know-and his tongue-he
was not designed for speech if you
insist on it i will see what our plasti-
cians can do

  now martha-

  you can have your pegasus
brownie but i think i may want this
toy elephant may i see him

  most surely hartstone

  the air answered blakesly yes
boss 

  bring napoleon to my lounge
  right away sir

  now about your pegasus mr
van vogel i see difficulties and i
need expert advice dr cargrew is
the real heart of this organization
the most eminent bio-designer-of
terrestrial origin of course-on the
world today he raised his voice to
actuate relays dr cargrew
what is it mr blakesly
doctor will you favor me by com-
ing to my office 

  im busy later

  mr blakesly excused himself
jerry is a man	

went into his inner office then re-
turned to say that dr cargrew
would be in shortly in the meantime
napoleon showed up the propor-
tions of his noble ancestors had been
preserved in miniature he looked
like a statuette of an elephant come
amazingly to life

  he took three measured steps into
the lounge then saluted them each
with his trunk in saluting mrs van
vogel he dropped on his knees as
well

  oh how cute she gurgled
come here napoleon

  the elephant looked at blakesly
who nodded napoleon ambled over
and laid his trunk across her lap she
scratched his ears he moaned con-
tentedly

  show the lady how you can
write ordered blakesly fetch
your things from my room

  napoleon waited while she fin-
ished treating a particularly satisfy-
ing itch then oozed away to return
shortly with several sheets of heavy
white paper and an oversize pencil
he spread a sheet in front of mrs
van vogel held it down daintly with
a fore foot grasped the pencil with
his trunk finger and printed in large
shaky letters

i like you

  the darling she dropped to her
knees and put her arms around his
neck i simply must have him how
much is he

  napoleon is part of a limited edi-
tion of six blakesly said carefully
do you want an exclusive model
or may the others be sold 

  oh i dont care i just want nap-
pie can i write him a note
certainly mrs van vogel print
large letters and use basic english
napoleon knows most of it his
price non-exclusive is 
that includes five years salary fbr
his attending veterinary

  give the gentleman a check
brownie she said over her shoul-
der

but martha- he protested
dont be tiresome brownie
she turned back to her pet and began
printing she hardly looked up when
dr cargrew came in

  cargrew was a chilly figure in
white overalls and skull cap he
shook hands brusquely struck a
cigarette and sat down blakesly ex-
plained

  cargrew shook his head its a
physical impossibility

van vogel stood up i can see
he said distantly that i should
have taken my custom to nulife
laboratories i came here because
we have a financial interest in this
firm and because i was naive enough
to believe the claims of your adver-
tisements

  siddown young man cargrew
ordered take your trade to those
thumb-fingered idiots if you wish-
but i warn you they couldnt grow
wings on a grasshopper first you
listen to me

  we can grow anything and make
it live i can make you a living thing
-i wont call it an animal-the size
and shape of that table over there it
wouldnt be good for anything but it
would be alive it would digest food
use chemical energy give off excre-
tions and display irritability but it
would be a silly piece of manipula-
tion mechanically a table and an
animal are two different things
their functions are different so
their shapes are different now i
can make you a winged horse

  you just said you couldnt
dont interrupt i can make a
winged horse that will look just like
the picture in the fairy stories if
you want to pay for it well make it
-were in business but it wont be
able to fly

  why not

  because its not built for flying
the ancient who dreamed up that
myth knew nothing about aerody-
namics and still less about biology
he stuck wings on a horse-just


wonder story annual

stuck them on thumbtacks and glue
but that doesnt make a flying ma-
chine remember son that an ani-
mal is a machine primarily a heat
engine with a control system to oper-
ate levers and hydraulic system ac-
cording to definite engineering laws
you savvy aerodynamics

   well im a pilot

  hummph well try to under-
stand this a horse hasnt got the
heat engine for flight hes a hay-
burner and thats not efficient we
might mess around with horses in-
sides so that he could live on a diet
of nothing but sugar and then he
might have enough energy to fly
short distances but he still would
not look like the mythical pegasus
to anchor his flying muscles he
would need a breast bone maybe ten
feet long he might have to have as
much as eighty feet wing spread
folded his wings would cover him
like a tent youre up against the
cube-square disadvantage

  huh

  cargrew gestured impatiently
lift goes by the square of a given
dimension dead load by the cube of
the same dimension other things be-
ing equal i might be able to make
you a pegasus the size of a cat with-
out distorting the proportions too
much

  no i want one i can ride i dont
mind the wing spread and ill put up
with the big breast bone when can

i	have him

  cargrew looked disgusted and
shrugged ill have to consult with
bna kreeth he whistled and
chirped a portion of the wall facing
them dissolved and they found them-
selves looking into a laboratory a
martian life-size showed in the
forepart of the three-dimensional
picture

  when the creature chirruped
back at cargrew mrs van vogel
looked up then quickly looked away
she knew it was silly but she simply
could not stand the sight of martians

-and the ones who had modified
themselves to a semi-manlike form
disgusted her the most

  after they had twittered and ges-
tured at each other for a minute or
two cargrew turned back to van
vogel bna says that you should
forget it it would take too long he
wants to know how youd like a fine
unicorn or a pair guaranteed to
breed true

  unicorns are old hat how long
would the pegasus take

  after another squeaky-door con-
versation cargrew answered ten
years probably sixteen years on the
guarantee

  ten years thats ridiculous
cargrew looked annoyed i
thought it would take fifty but if
bna kreeth says that he can do it
in three to five generations then he
can do it bna is the finest bio-
micrurgiston on two planets his
chromosome surgery is unequalled
after all young man natural proc-
esses would take upwards of a mil-
lion years to achieve the same result
if -it were achieved at all do you ex-
pect to be able to buy miracles 

  van vogel had the grace to look
sheepish excuse me doctor lets
forget it ten years really is too long
how about the other possibility
you said you could make a picture-
book pegasus as long as i did not
insist on flight could i ride him
on the ground 

  oh certainly no good for polo
but you could ride him

  ill settle for that ask benny
creeth or what ever his name is
how long it will take

  the martian had already faded
from the screen

  i dont need to ask him car-
grew asserted this is my job-
rurely manipulation bnas collabor-
ation is required only for rearrange-
ment and transplanting of genes-
true genetic work i can let you have
the beast in eighteen months
cant you do better than that
jerry is a man	

  what do you expect man it
takes eleven months to grow a new-
born colt i want one month of de-
sign and planning the embryo will
be removed on the fourth day and
will be developed in an extra-uterine
capsule ill operate ten or twelve
times during gestation grafting and
budding and other things youve
never heard of one year from now
well have a baby colt with wings
thereafter ill deliver to you a six
months-old pegasus

   ill take it

  cargrew made some notes then
read one alate horse not capable
of flight and not to breed true basic
breed your choice-i suggest a palo-
mino or an arabian wings de-
signed after a condor in white sim-
ulated pin feathers with a grafted
fringe of quill feathers or reason-
able facsimiles he passed the sheet
over initial that and well start in
advance of formal contract

  its a deal agreed van vogel
what is the fee he placed his
monogram under cargrews

  cargrew made further notes and
handed them to blakesly-estimates
of professional man-hours techni-
cian man-hours purchases and over-
head he had padded the figures to
subsidize his colateral research but
even he raised his eyebrows at
the dollars-and-cents interpretation
blakesly put on the data

  that will be an even two million
dollars

  van vogel hesitated his wife had
looked up at the mention of money
but she turned her attention back to
the scholarly elephant

  blakesly added hastily that is
for an exclusive creation of course

ii

just as van vogel was ready to
return his wife insisted on seeing
the apes as she termed the anthro-

poid workers the discovery that she
owned a considerable share in these
sub-human creatures had intrigued
her blakesly eagerly suggested a
trip through the laboratories in
which the workers were developed
from true apes

  they were arranged in seven
buildings the seven days of crea-
tion first day was a large build-
ing occupied by cargrew his staff
his operating rooms incubators and
laboratories martha van vogel
stared in horrified fascination at liv-
ing organs and even complete em-
bryos living artificial lives sustained
by clever glass and metal recircu-
lating systems and exquisite auto-
matic machinery

  she could not appreciate the tech-
niques it seemed depressing she
had about decided against plasto-
biology when napoleon by tugging
at her skirts reminded her that it
produced good things as well as hor-
rors

  the building second day they
did not enter it was occupjed by
bna kreeth and his racial col-
leagues

  we could not stay alive in it you
understand blakesly explained
van vogel nodded his wife hurried
on-she wanted no martians even
behind plastiglass

  from there on the buildings were
for development and production of
commercial workers third day
was used for the development of var-
iations in the anthropoids to meet
constantly changing labor require-
ments fourth day was a very
large building devoted entirely to
production-line incubators for com-
mercial types of anthropoids blakes-
ly explained that they had dispensed
with normal birth

  the policy permits exact control
of forced variations such as for size
and saves hundreds of thousands of
worker-hours on the part of the fe-
male anthropoids

  martha van vogel was delighted
	wonder story annual

with fifth day the anthropoid
kindergarten where the little tykes
learned to talk and were conditioned
to the social patterns necessary to
their station in life they worked at
simple tasks such as sorting buttons
and digging holes in sand piles with
pieces of candy given as incentives
for fast and accurate work

  sixth day completed the anthro-
poids educations each learned the
particular sub-trade it would prac-
tice cleaning digging and especial-
ly agricultural semi-skills such as
weeding thinning and picking

  one nisei farmer working three
neo-chimpanzees can grow as many
vegetables as a dozen old-style farm
hands blakesly asserted they
really like to work-when we get
through with them

  they admired the almost incred-
ibly heavy tasks done by modified
gorillas and stopped to gaze at the
little neo-capuchins doing high pick-
ing on prop trees then moved on
toward seventh day

  this building was used for the
radioactive mutation of genes and
was therefore located some distance
away from the others they had to
walk as the sidewalk was being re-
paired  the detour took them past
workers pens and barracks some of
the anthropoids crowded up to the
wire and began calling to them
sigret sigret preese missy
preese boss sigret

  what are they saying martha
van vogel inquired

  they are asking for cigarettes
blakesly answered in annoyed tones
they know better but they are like
children here-ill put a stop to it
he stepped up to the wire and shout-
ed to an elderly male hey straw-
boss

  the worker addressed wore in
addition to the usual short canvas
kilt a bedraggled arm band he
turned and shuffled toward the fence

  strawboss ordered blakesly
get those joes away from here

   okay boss the old fellow ac-
knowledged and started cuffing those
nearest him scram you joes
scram

   but i have some cigarettes pro-
tested mrs van vogel and i would
gladly have given them some

  it doesnt do to pamper them
the manager told her they have
been taught that luxuries come only
from work i must apologize for my
poor children those in these pens
are getting old and forgetting their
manners 

she did not answer but moved fur-
ther along the fence to where one
old neo-chimp was pressed up
against the wire staring at them
with soft tragic eyes like a child at
a bakery window he had taken no
oart in the jostling demand for to-
bacco and had been let alone by the
strawboss

   would you like a cigarette she
asked him

   preese missy

   she struck one which he accepted
with fumbling grace took a long
lung-filling drag and let the smoke
trickle out his nostrils

  sankoo missy me jerry

  how do vou do jerry

  howdy missy he bobbed down
bending his knees ducking his head
and clasping his hands to his chest
all in one movement

  come along martha her hus-
band and blakesly had moved in be-
hind her

  in a moment she answered
brownie meet my friend jerry
doesnt he look just like uncle al-
bert except that he looks so sad
why are you unhappy jerry

  they dont understand abstract
ideas put in blakesly

  but jerry surprised him jerry
sad he announced in tones so dole-
ful that martha van vogel did not
know whether to laugh or to cry

  why jerry she asked gently
wthy are you so sad
jerry is a man



  no work he stated no sigret
no candy no work

  these are all old workers who
have passed their usefulness
blakesly repeated idleness upsets
them but we have nothing for them
to do

  well she said then why dont
you have them sort buttons or some-
thing like that such as the baby
ones do

  they wouldnt even do that prop-
erly blakesly answered these
workers are senile

  jerry isnt senile you heard
him talk

  well perhaps not just a mo-
ment he turned to the apeman
who was squatting down in order to
scratch napoleons head with a long
forefinger thrust through the fence
you joe come here

  blakesly felt around the workers
hairy neck and located a thin steel
chain to which was attached a small
metal tag he studied it

  youre right he admitted hes
not really over age but his eyes are
bad i remember the lot-cataracts
as a result of an unfortunate linked
mutation he shrugged

  but thats no reason to let him
grieve his heart out in idleness
really mrs van vogel you
should not upset yourself about it
they dont stay in these pens long-
only a few days at the most

  oh she answered somewhat
mollified you have some other pace
to retire them to then do you give
them something to do there jerry
wants to work dont you jerry
the neo-chimp had been strug-
gling to follow the conversation he
caught the last idea and grinned

  jerry work sure mike good
worker he flexed his fingers then
made fists displaying fully opposed
thumbs

  mr blakesly seemed somewhat
nonplussed really mrs van vogel
there is no need you see- he
stopped

  van vogel had been listening irri-
tably his wifes enthusiasms an-
noyed him unless they were also his
own furthermore he was beginning
to blame blakesly for his own recent
extravagance and had a premonition
that his wife would find some way to
make him pay very sweetly for his
indulgence

  being annoyed with both of them
he chucked in the perfect wrong re-
mark dont be silly martha they
dont retire them they liquidate
them

it took a little time for the idea to
soak in but when it did she was
furious why-why-i never heard
of such a thing you ought to be
ashamed you-you would shoot
your own grandmother

  mrs van vogel-please

  dont mrs van vogel me its
got to stop-do you hear me she
looked around at the death pens at
the miling hundreds of old workers
therein its horrible you work
them until they cant work anymore
then you take away their little com-
forts and you dispose of them i
wonder you dont eat them

  thev do her husband said bru-
tallv dog food

  what well well put a stop to
that

  mrs van vogel blakesly plead-
ed let me explain

  hummvh go ahead it had bet-
ter be good

  well its like this- his eye
fell on jerry standing with worried
expression at the fence scram
joe jerry shuffled away

  wait jerry mrs van vogel
called out jerry paused uncertainly
tell him to come back she ordered
blakesly

  the manager bit his lip then
called out come back here

  he was beginning definitely to dis-
like mrs van vogel despite his auto-
matic tendency to genuflect in the
presence of a high credit rating to

be told how to run his own business
-well now indeed

  mrs van vogel i admire your
humanitarian spirit but you dont
understand the situation we under-
stand our workers and do what is
best for them they die painlessly be-
fore their disabilities can trouble
them they live happy lives happier
than yours or mine we trim off the
bad part of their lives nothing more
and dont forget these poor beasts
would never have been born had we
not arranged it

  she shook her head fiddlesticks
youll be quoting the bible at me
next there will be no more of it
mr blakesly i shall hold you per-
sonally responsible

  blakesly looked bleak my re-
sponsibilities are to the directors
you think so she opened her
purse and snatched out her tele-
phone so great was her agitation
that she did not bother to call
through but signalled the local relay
operator instead phoenix get me
great new york murray hill q-
 mr haskell priority-star sub-
scriber  make it quick she
stood there tapping her foot and
glaring until her business manager
answered haskell this is martha
van vogel how much workers in-
corporated common do i own no
no never mind that-what percent
-so well its not enough i want
 by tomorrow morning  all
right get proxies for the rest but get
it i didnt ask you what it would
cost i said to get it get busy she
disconnected abruptly and turned to
her husband were leaving brow-
nie and we are taking jerry with us
mr blakesly will you kindly have
him taken out of that pen give him
a check for the amount brownie
now martha-

  my mind is made up brow-nie
mr blakesly cleared his throat it
was going to be pleasant to thwart
this woman

  the workers are never sold im

sorry its a matter of policy

  very well then ill take a perma-
nent lease

  this worker has been removed
from the labor market he is not for
lease

  am i going to have more trouble
with you

  if you please madame this
worker is not available under any
terms-but as a courtesy to you i
am willing to transfer to you inden-
tures for him gratis i want you to
know that the policies of this firm
are formed from a very real concern
for the welfare of our charges as
wrell as from the standpoint of good
business practice we therefore re-
serve the right to inspect at any time
to assure ourselves that you are tak-
ing proper care of this worker
there he told himself savagely
that will stop her clock

  of course thank you mr
blakesly you are most gracious

ill

the trip back to great new york
was not jolly napoleon hated it
and let it be known jerry was pa-
tient but airsick by the time they
grounded the van vogels were not
on speaking terms

  im sorry mrs van vogel has-
kell said the shares were simply
not available we should have had
proxy on the otoole block but some-
one tied them up an hour before i
reached them

  blakesly

  undoubtedly you should not
have tipped him off you gave him
time to warn his employers

  dont waste time telling me what
mistakes i made yesterday what
are you going to do today

  my dear mrs van vogel what
can i do

  dont talk nonsense you are
supposed to be smarter than i am
thats why  pay you to do my think-
jerry is a man



in for me tf youre not capable-
mr haskell looked helpless

  his principal struck a cigarette so
hard she broke it

  why isnt wycoff here

  really mrs van vogel there are
no special legal aspects you want
the stock we cant buy it nor bind
it therefore-

  i pay wycoff to know the le-
gal angles get him

  wycoff was leaving his office has-
kell caught him on a chase-me cir-
cuit

  alan haskell called out come
to my office will you oscar has-
kell

  sorry how about four oclock
alan i want you-now cut in
the clients voice this is martha
van vogel

  the little man shrugged helpless-
ly right away he agreed that
woman-why hadnt he retired on
his one hundred and twenty-fifth
birthday as his wife had urged him 

  then minutes later he was listen-
ing to haskells explanations and his
clients interruptions when they
had finished he spread his hands

  what do you expect mrs van
vogel these workers are chattels
you have not been able to buy the
property rights involved you are
stopped but i dont see what you
are worked up about they gave you
the worker whose life you wanted
preserved

  she spoke forcefully under her
breath before she answered him

  thats not important what is
one worker among millions  want
to stop this killing all of it

  wycoff shook his head if you
were able to prove that their meth-
ods of disposing of these beasts were
inhumane or that they were negli-
gent of their physical wrelfare before
destroying them or that the destruc-
tion was wanton-

  wanton it certainly is
probably not in a legal sense my
dear lady there was a case julius

hartman et al vs hartman es-
tate  i believe in which a per-
manent injunction was granted
against carrying out a term of the
will which called for the destruction
of a valuable collection of persian
cats but in order to usethat theory
you would have to show that these
creatures when superannuated are
nevertheless more valuable alive
than dead you cannot compel a
person to maintain chattels at a
loss

  see here alan i didnt get you
over here to tell me how this cant
be done if what i want isnt legal
then get a law passed

ycoff looked at haskell who
looked embarrassed and an-
swered  well the fact of the matter
is mrs van vogel that we have
agreed with the other members of
the commonwealth association not
to subsidize any legislation during
the incumbency of the present ad-
ministration

  how ridiculous why

  the  legislative guild has
brought out a new fair-practices
code which we consider quite un-
fair a sliding scale which penalizes
the well-to-do-all very nice sound-
ing with special provisions for nom-
inal fees for veterans private bills
and such things-but in fact the
code is confiscatory even the briggs
foundation can hardly afford to take
a proper interest in public affairs
under this so-called code

  humph a fine day when legis-
lators join unions-they are profes-
sional men bribes should be com-
petitive get an injunction

  mrs van vogel protested wy-
coff how can you expect me to get
an injunction against an organiza-
tion which has no legal existence in
a legal sense there is no legislative
guild just as the practice of assist-
ing legislation by subsidy has itself
no legal existence

  and babies come under cabbage
	wonder story annual

leaves quit stalling me gentlemen
what are you going to do 

  wycoff spoke when he saw that
haskell did not intend to mrs van
vogel i think we should retain a
special shyster

  i dont employ shysters ever-
i dont understand the way they
think i am a simple housewife
alan

  mr wycoff flinched at her self-
designation while noting that he
must not let her find out that the
salary of his own staff shyster was
charged to her payroll as conven-
tion required he maintained the
front of a simple barefoot solicitor
but he had found out long ago that
martha van vogels problems re-
quired an occasional dose of the more
exotic branch of the law

  the man i have in mind is a
creative artist he insisted it is
no more necessary to understand
him than it is to understand the
composer in order to appreciate a
symphony i do recommend that you
talk with him at least

  oh very well get him up here
here my dear lady haskell
was shocked at the suggestion wy-
coff looked amazed it would not
only cause any action you bring to
be thrown out of court if it were
known that you had consulted this
man but it would prejudice any
briggs enterprise for years

  mrs van vogel shrugged you
men i never will understand the
way you think why shouldnt one
consult a shyster as openly as one
consults an astrologer

james roderick mccoy was
not a large man but he seemed
large he managed to dominate even
so large a room as mrs van vogels
spacious saloh his card read

j r mccoy
the real mccoy

licensed shyster-fixing special
contacts angles
all work guaranteed
telephone skyline -m
ask for mac

  the number given was the pool
room of the notorious three planets
club he wasted no time on offices
and kept his files in his head-the
only safe place for them

  he was sitting on the floor at-
tempting to teach jerry to shoot
craps while mrs van vogel ex-
plained her problems

  what do you think mr mccoy
could we approach it through the
spca my public relations staff
coum give it a build up

  mccoy got to his feet jerrys
eyes arent so bad he caught me
trying to palm box cars off on him as
a natural no he continued the
spca angle is no good its wrhat
workers will expect theyll be
ready to prove that the anthropoids
actually enjoy being killed off
jerry rattled the dice hopefully
thats all jerry-scram

  okay boss the ape-man got to
his feet and went to the big stereo
which filled a corner of the room
napoleon ambled after him and
switched it on jerry punched a
selector button and got a blues sing-
er napoleon immediately punched
another then another and another
until he got a loud but popular band
he stood there beating out the
rhythm with his trunk

  jerry looked pained and switched
it back to his blues singer napoleon
stubbornly reached out with his pre-
hensile nose and switched it off
jerry used a swear wrord

  boys called out mrs van vogel
quit squabbling jerry let nappie
play what he wants to you can play
the stereo when nappy has to take
his nap

  okay missy boss

  mccoy wras interested jerry
likes music

  like it he loves it hes been
learning to sing

  huh this i gotta hear
certainly nappie-turn off the
stereo the elephant complied but
managed to look put upon now
jerry is a man



jerry-jingle bells  she led him
in it

   jingle bells jingle bells jingle all
the day-and he followed

  jinger bez jinger bez jinger aw-
rah day

  oh ivot fun tis to ride in one-hoss
open sray

  he was flat he was terrible he
looked ridiculous patting out the
time with one splay foot but it was
singing

  say thats fast mccoy com-
mented too bad nappie cant talk
-wed have a-duct

  jerry looked puzzled nappie talk
good he stated he bnt over the
elephant and spoke to him napoleon
grunted and moaned back at him
see boss jerry said trium-
phantly

  what did he say

  he say can nappie pray stereo
now 

  very well jerry mrs van
vogel interceded the ape-man
spoke to his chum in whispers na-
poleon squealed and did not turn on
the stereo

  jerry said his mistress  said
nothing of the sort he does not
have to play your blues singer come
away jerry nappie-play what you
want to

  you mean he tried to cheat
mccoy inquired with interest

  he certainly did

  hmm-jerrys got the makings
of a real citizen shave him and put
shoes on him and hed get by all
right in the precinct i grew up in
he stared at the anthropoid jerry
stared back puzzled but patient

  mrs van vogel had thrown away
the dirty canvas kilt which was both
his badge of servitude and a conces-
sion to propriety and had replaced
it with a kilt in the bright cameron
war plaid complete to sporran and
topped off with a glengarry

  do you suppose he could learn
to play the bagpipes  mccoy asked
im beginning to get an angle

  why i dont know whats your
idea

  mccoy squatted down cross-leg-
ged and began practicing rolls with
his dice

  never mind he answered when
it suited him that angles no good
but were getting there he rolled
four naturals one after the other
you say jerry still belongs to the
corporation 

  in a titular sense yes i doubt
if they will ever try to repossess
himm

  i wish they would try he
-scooped up the dice and stood up
its in the bag sis forget it ill
want to talk to your publicity man
but you can quit worrying about it

iv

of course mrs van vogel
should have knocked before en-
tering her husbands room-but
then she would not have overheard
what he was saying nor to whom

  thats right she heard him say
we havent any further need for
him take him away the sooner the
better just be sure the men you
send have a signed order directing
us to turn him over

  she was not apprehensive as she
did not understand the conversation
but merely curious she looked over
her husbands shoulder at the video
screen

  there she saw blakeslys face his
voice was saying very well mr
van vogel the anthropoid will be
picked up tomorrow

  she strode up to the screen just
a minute mr blakesly-then to
her husband brownie what in the
world do you think you are doing
the expression she surprised on
his face was not one he had ever
let her see before

  why dont you knock
	wonder story annual

  maybe its a good thing i didnt
brownie did i hear you right were
you telling mr blakesly to pick up
jerry she turned to the screen
was that it mr blakesly

  that is correct mrs van vogel
and i must say i find this confusion
most-

  stow it she turned back
brownie what have you got to say
for yourself

  martha you are being prepos-
terous between that elephant and
that ape this place is a zoo i actu-
ally caught your precious jerry
smoking my special cigars today-
not to mention the fact that both of
them play the stereo all day long
until a man cant get a moments
peace i certainly dont have to stand
for such things in my own house
whose house browmie

  thats beside the point i will not
stand for-

  never mind she turned to the
screen my husband seems to have
lost his taste for exotic animals mr
blakesly cancel the order for a
pegasus

  martha

  sauce for the goose brownie ill
pay for your whims but not for your
tantrums the contract is cancelled
mr blakesley mr haskell will ar-
range the details

  blakesly shrugged your capri-
cious behavior will cost you of
course the penalties-

  i said mr haskell would arrange
the details one more thing mister
manager blakesly-have you done
as i told you

  what do you mean

  you know what i mean are
those poor creatures -still alive and
well

  that is not your business he
had in fact suspended the killings
the directors had not wanted to take
any chances until they saw what the
briggs trust could manage but
blakesley would not give her the
satisfaction of knowing that

  she looked at him as if he were
a skipped dividend its not eh
well bear this in mind you cold-
blooded little pigsqueak im holding
you personally responsible if just
one of them dies from anything ill
have your skin for a rug she
flipped off the connection and turned
to her husband brownie-

  its useless to say anything he
cut in in the cold voice he normally
used to bring her to heel i shall
be at the club goodbye

  thats just what i was going to
suggest

  what

  ill have your clothes sent over
do you have anything else in this
house

  he stared at her dont talk like
a fool martha

  im not talking like a fool she
looked him up and down my but
you are handsome brownie i guess
i was a fool to think i could buy a
big hunk of man with a checkbook
i guess a girl gets them free or
she doesnt get them at all thanks
for the lesson she turned and
slammed out of the room and into
her own suite

five minutes later make-up re-
paired and nerves steadied by a
few whiffs of fly-right she called
the pool room of the three planets
club mccoy came to the screen car-
rying a cue

  oh its you sugar puss well
snap it up-ive got four bits on this
game

  this is business

  okay okay-spill it

  she told him the essentials im
sorry about cancelling the flying
horse contract mr mccoy i hope
it wont make your job any harder
im afraid i lost my temper
fine go lose it again

  huh

  youre barrelling down the
groove kid call blakesly up again
bawl him out tell him to keep his
jerry is a man



bailiffs away from you or youll stuff

ber this you cant have a bull fight

rary injunction restraining work-
ers incorporated from reclaiming

wholesale murder if it takes every
cent youve got

about having cancelled that silly
winged-horse deal i always did
think your old man was weak in the
head and its saved you a nice piece
of change youll need it when i send
in my bill boy am i going to clip
you bye now

  the bright letters trailed around
the sides of the times building
worlds richest woman puts up
fight for ape-man the giant
video screen above showed a tran-
scribe of jerry in his ridiculous
highland chief outfit

  a small army of private police
surrounded the briggs town house
while mrs van vogel informed any-
one who would listen including sev-
eral news services that she would
defend jerry personally and to the
death

  the public relations office of
workers incorporated denied any
intention of seizing jerry the denial
got nowhere

  in the meantime technicians in-
stalled extra audio and video circuits
in the largest courtroom in town for
one jerry no surname described
as a legal permanent resident of
these united states had asked for a
permanent injunction against the

corporate person workers its offi-
cers employees successors or as-
signees forbidding it to do him any
physical harm and in particular for-
bidding it to kill him

  through his attorney the honor-
able and distinguished and stuffily
respectable augustus pomfrey jer-
ry brought the action in his own
name

  martha van vogel sat in the court-
room as a spectator only she was
sux-rounded by secretaries guards
maid publicity men and yes men
she had one television camera
trained on her alone she was nerv-
ous mccoy had insisted on briefing
pomfrey through wycoff to keep
pomfrey from knowing that he was
being helped by a shyster she had
her own opinion of pomfrey

  the mccoy had insisted that jer-
ry not wear his beautiful new kilt
but had dressed him in faded dunga-
ree trousers and jacket it seemed
poor theater to her

  jerry himself worried her he
seemed confused by the lights and
the noise and the crowd about to go
to pieces

  and mccoy had refused to go to
the trial with her he had told her
that it was quite impossible that
his mere presence would alienate the
court and wycoff had backed him
up men their minds were devious
-they seemed to like twisted ways
of doing things it confirmed her
opinion that men should not be al-
lowed to vote

but she felt lost -without the im-
mediate presence of mccoys
breezy self-confidence away from
him she wandered why she had ever
trusted such an important matter to
an irresponsible jumping jack bird-
brained clown like mccoy she
chewed her nails and wished he were
present

  the panel of attorneys appearing
for workers incorporated began by
moving that the action be dismissed


wonder story annual

without trial on the theory that
jerry was a chattel of the corpora-
tion an integral part of it and no
more able to sue than the thumb can
sue the brain

  the honorable augustus pomfrey
looked every inch the statesman as
he bowed to the court and to his
opponents

  it is indeed strange he began
to hear the second-hand voice of a
legal fiction a soulless imaginary
quantity called a corporate person
argue that a flesh-and-blood crea-
ture a being of hopes and longings
and passions has no legal existence
i see here beside me my poor cousin
jerry he patted jerry on the
shoulder the ape-man needing re-
assurance slid a hand into his it
went over well

  but when i look for this abstract
fancy workers what do i find
nothing-some words on paper
some signed bits of foolscap-

  if the court please a question
put in the opposition chief attorney
does the learned counsel contend
that a limited liability stock com-
pany cannot own property

  will the counsel reply directed
the judge

  thank you my esteemed col-
league has set up a straw man i
contended only that the question as
to whether jerry is a chattel of
workers incorporated is imma-
terial non-essential irrelevant i
am a part of thecorporate city
of great new york does that
deny me my civil rights as a person
of flesh and blood in fact it does
not even rob me of my rights to sue
that civic corporation of which i am
a part if in my opinion i am
wronged byit

  we are met today in the mellow
light of equity rather than in the
cold and narrow confines of law it
seems a fit time to dwell on the
strange absurdities we live by where
-under a nonenity of paper and
legal fiction we could deny the exist-

ence of this our poor cousin i ask
that the learned attorneys for the
corporation stipulate that jerry
does in fact exist and let us get
on with the action

  they huddled the answer was
no

  very well my client asks to be
examined in order that the court
may determine his status and be-
ing

  objection this anthropoid can-
not be examined he is a mere part
and chattel of the respondent
that is what we are about to de-
termine the court answered dry-
ly objection overruled

  go sit in that chair jerry
objection this beast cannot
take an oath-it is beyond his com-
prehension

  what have you to say to that
counsel

  if it please the court answered
pomfrey the simplest thing to do
is to put him in the chair and find
out

  let him take the stand the clerk
will administer the oath martha
van vogel gripped the arms of her
chair mccoy had spent a full week
training him for this would the
poor thing blow up without mccoy
to guide him

  the clerk droned through the
oath jerry looked puzzled but pa-
tient

  your honor said pomfrey
when young children must give tes-
timony it is customary to permit a
little leeway in the wording to fit
their mental attainments may i be
permitted he walked up to jerry

  jerry my boy are you a good
worker

  sure mike jerry good worker
maybe bad worker huh lazy
hide from strawboss

  no no no jerry good worker
dig weed not dig up vegetaber
dig up weed work hard

  you will see pomfrey ad-
dressed the court that my client
jerry is a man	

has very definite ideas of what is
true and what is false now let us
attempt to find out whether or not
he has moral values which require
him to tell the truth jerry-

  ygs boss

  pomfrey spread his hand in front
of the anthropoids face how many
fingers do you see 

  jerry reached out and ticked them
off one-two-sree-four uh-five
six fingers jerry

  five boss

  six fingers jerry i give you
cigarette six

  five boss jerry not cheat
pomfrey spread his hands will
the court accept him

v

the court did martha van vogel
sighed jerry could not count
very well and she had been afraid
that he would forget his lines and
accept the bribe but he had been
promised all the cigarettes he want-
ed and chocolate as well if he would
remember to insist that five was five

  i suggest pomfrey went on
that the matter has been estab-
lished jerry is an entity if he can
be accepted as a witness then surely
he may have his day in court even
a dog may have his day in court
will my esteemed colleagues stipu-
late

  workers incorporated through
its battery of lawyers agreed-just
in time for the judge was beginning
to cloud up he had been much im-
pressed by the little performance

  the tide was with him pomfrey
used it if it please the court and
if the counsels for the respondent
will permit we can shorten these
proceedings i will state the theory
under which relief is sought and
then- by a few questions it may be
settled one way or another i ask

that it be stipulated that it was the
intention of workers incorporated
through its servants to take the life
of my client

  stipulation was refused

  so then i ask that the court
take judicial notice of the well
known fact that these anthropoid
workers are destroyed when they
no longe show a profit thereafter
i will call witnesses starting with
horace blakesly to show that jerry
was and presumably is under sufch
sentence of death

  another hurried huddle resulted
in the stipulation that jerry had in-
deed been scheduled for euthanasia

  then said pomfrey i will
state my theory jerryis not an ani-
mal but a man it is not legal to kill
-it is murder

  first there was silence then the
crowd gasped people had grown
used to animals that talked and
worked but they were no more pre-
pared to think of them as persons
humans men than were the haughty
roman citizens prepared to concede
human feelings to their barbarian
slaves

  pomfrey let them have it while
they were still groggy what is a
man a collection of living cells
and tissues  a legal fiction like this
corporate person that would take
poor jerrys life no a man is none
of these things a man is a collection
of hopes and fears of human long-
ings of aspirations greater than
himself-more than the clay from
which he came less than the creator
which lifted him up from the clay
jerry has been taken from his jungle
and made something more than the
poor creatures who were his ances-
tors even as you and i we ask that
this court recognize his manhood

  the opposing attorneys saw that
the court was moved they drove in
fast an anthropoid they contended
could not be a man because he lacked
human shape and human intelli-
gence pomfrey called his first wit-
	wonder story annual

ness-master bna kreeth

  the martians normal bad temper
had not been improved by being
forced to wait around for three days
in a travel tank to say nothing of
the indignity of having to interrupt
his researches to take part in the
childish pow-wows of terrestrials

  there was further delay to irri-
tate him while pomfrey forced the
corporation attorneys to accept bna
as an expert witness they wanted
to refuse but could not-he was their
own director of research he also
held voting control of all martian-
held workers stock a fact unmen-
tioned but hampering

  more delay while an interpreter
was brought in to help administer
the oath-bna kreeth self-centered
as all martians had never bothered
to learn english

  he twittered and chirped in an-
swer to the demand that he tell the
truth the whole truth and so forth
the interpreter looked pained

  he says he cant do it he in-
formed the judge

  pomfrey asked for exact transla-
tion the interpreter looked uneasily
at the judge

  he says that if he told the whole
truth you fools-not fools exactly
its a martian word meaning a sort
of headless worm-would not under-
stand it

briefly the court discussed the
idea of contempt when the mar-
tian understood that he was about to
be forced to remain in a travel tank
for thirty days he came off his high
horse and agreed to tell the truth as
adequately as was possible he was
accepted as a witness

  are you a man demanded pom-
frey

  under your laws and by your
standards i am a man

  by what theory your body is
unlike ours you cannot even live in
our air you do not speak our lan-
guage your ideas are alien to us

how can you be a man

  the martian answeved carefully
i quote from the terra-martian
treaty which you must accept as
supreme law all members of the
great race while sojourning on the
third planet shall have all the
rights and prerogatives of the native
dominant race of the second planet
this clause has been interpreted by
the bi-planet tribunal to mean that
members of the great race are
men whatever that may be
why do you refer to your sort as
the great race

  because of our superior intelli-
gence

  superior to men

  we are men

  superior to the intelligence of
earth men

  that is self-evident

  just as we are superior in intel-
ligence to this poor creature jerry
that is not self-evident
finished with the witness an-
nounced pomfrey

  the opposition counsels should
have left bad-enough alone instead
they tried to get bna kreeth to de-
fine the difference in intelligence be-
tween humans and workcr-anthro-
poids master bna explained metic-
ulously that cultural differences
masked the intrinsic differences if
any and that in any case both an-
thropoids and men made so little use
of their respective potential intelli-
gences that it was really too early
to tell which race would turn out to
be the superior race in the third
planet

  he had just begun to discuss how
a truly superior race could be bred
by combining the best features of
anthropoids and men when he was
hastily asked to stand down
may it please the court said
pomfrey we have not advanced the
theory we have merely disposed of
respondents contention that a par-
ticular shape and a particular degree
of intelligence are necessary to man-
jerry is a man



hood i now ask that the petitioner
be recalled to the stand that the
court may determine whether he is
in truth human

  if the learned court please-
the battery of lawyers had been in
a huddle ever since bna kreeths
travel tank had been removed from
the room the chief counsel now
spoke

  the object of the petition ap-
pears to be to protect the life of this
chattel there is no need to draw out
these proceedings respondent stipu-
lates that this chattel will be allowed
to die a natural death in the hands
of its present custodian and moves
that the action be dismissed

  what do you say to that the
court asked pomfrey

  pomfrey visibly gathered his toga
about him we ask not for cold
charity from this corporation but
for the justice of the court we ask
that jerrys humanity be established
as a matter of law not for him to
vote nor to hold property nor to be
relieved of special police regulations
appropriate to his group-but we
do ask that he be adjudged at least
as human as that aquarium mon-
strosity just removed from this
courtroom

  the judge turned to jerry is
that what you want jerry

  jerry looked uneasily at pomfrey
then said okay boss

  come up to the chair

  one moment- the opposition
chief counsel seemed flurried i ask

the court to consider that a ruling
in this matter may affect a long es-
tablished commercial practice neces-
sary to the economic life of-
objection pomfrey was on his
feet bristling never have i heard
a more outrageous attempt to preju-
dice a decision my esteemed col-
league might as well ask the court
to decide a murder case from politi-
cal considerations i protest-
never mind said the court
the suggestion will be ignored
proceed with your witness

  pomfrey bowed we are explor-
ing the meaning of this strange
thing called manhood we have
seen that it is not a matter of shape
nor race nor planet of birth nor of
acuteness of mind truly it cannot
be defined yet it may be experienced
it can reach from heart to heart
from spirit to spirit he turned to
jerry jerry-will you sing your
new song for the judge

  sure boss jerry looked uneasi-
ly up at the whirring cameras the
mikes and the ikes then cleared his
throat

  way down upon de suwanee rib-
ber

  far far away

  deres where my heart is turning
ebber-

  the applause scared him out of
his wits the banging of the gavel
frightened him still more-but it
mattered not the issue was no long-
er in doubt

  jerry was a man

charles crossley presi-
dent of american jet-pro-
pelled ships felt himself
spreadeagled in his favorite living
room chair the voice on the tele-
visor moaned europe crossley
twitched secret atomic factories
crossley jerked semi-dictatorships
crossley sweated political pressures
war crossley writhed

  his wife shut the televisor off
indignantly nonsense she stared
at her limp husband tri-union
hasnt any weapons we havent any
neither has russia britain or any-
one else that was all settled and
forbidden ages ago when was it
i

  crossley stroked his receding hair-
line sighing theyre making atom
bombs in secret he said he littered
the rug with cigar ash

  stop that cried his wife my
nice rug

  the rug oh the confounded rug
he said and muttered away closing
his eyes for a long minute then he
opened one eye he looked at his
wife he looked at the rug the cigar
in his hand the fallen ashes

 the rug he shut his eyes
again five minutes later he leaped
up with an explosion of sound the
rug ive got it ive got it he
seized his wife kissed her you are

brilliant i love you thats it that
is it

  he rushed madly off in the general
direction of europe

  thus began the tri-union-amer-
ican war of the year 

  the small jet-propelled ship
crossed the atlantic in fiery gusts
in it was charles crossley a man
with an idea behind it three thou-
sand other ships tore along putting
space behind they were his ships
they belonged to his company he
employed the men this was his own
private war

  ha mr crossley laughed quite
obviously

  the radio cut in on him cross-
ley

  crossley answered speaking

  this is the president crossley
the voice was sharp and it fairly
heated the interior of the ship
turn back in the name of com-
mon sense what are you up to ill
seize your company

  this can wait mr president
weve been sweating it out for
months the tri-union wont admit
its setting up a fascistic skeleton
in europe we cant find any proof
they are but there are rumors
weve got to get it out in the open
we cant wait im sorry i have to
act alone bombardiers

  and to think mused crossley
happily as he turned his ship home-
ward to think the entire idea came
from spilling ashes on the rug hi-
ho

  the president of the united states
shook his fist

  you bombed them

  crossley yawned there is no
law against dropping waste paper
he said quietly

  you attacked the people of the
tri-union states

  no one injured said crossley
calmly no explosion no bruises
no fatalities did anybody even get a
piece of confetti in his eye the
answer is no a two letter word
crossley lit a cigarette fifty
thousand housefraus and one hun-
dred thousand children swept side-
walks men flooded employment of-
fices in vienna for street sweeper
jobs but ah that clever devilish
confetti it was electrically and
chemically impregnated it vanished
when touched by human hands it
reappeared when humans withdrew
from the immediate vicinity brooms
helped little when disturbed the
confetti had a curious habit of jump-
ing like tiddle-de-winks or jumping
beans sensitive little things i dare
say itll be some weeks before vienna
is clean that is what i have done
to the tri-union the world or-
ganization forbids an attack was
this an attack sir confetti on the
wind eh

  the world organization forbids
war cried the president

  this is not war crossley leaned
forward tapped the desk earnestly
suppose we dropped confetti every
day causing the tri-union popula-
tion to pluck and curry their lawns
 days a year and there are
other things we can do mr presi-
dent little irritating things ima-
gine it mr president will you
the president imagined it for
quite awhile then slowly he began
to smile

it was a sweet day a morning in
the tri-union state of bruegher
the sky was blue the clouds were
nicely white and upon the rolling
green hills a picnic was spread with
thousands of tossed paper napkins
hundreds of bread heels crusts can
openers sardine tins dropped eggs
and wadded cardboard cartons the
picnic like a liver of several thou-
sand parts engulfed the park-like
hills one small boy running through
the dells paused to leave his semi-
digested lunch

  laughter wine bottles gurgling
songs

  the president of the united states
and mr crossley clinked glasses
heading the picnic drank gustily re-
filled drank again others yelled
screamed in delight played tag
threw away bottles

  and on twenty thousand other
tri-union hills twenty thousand
other small family ships landed
twenty thousand more picnic riots
began sixty thousand napkins well
wadded were dropped from wiped
lips one hundred thousand shat-
tered egg shells were spilled sixty
thousand shiny soup cans were left
gleaming in the sun three hundred
million ants rushed out to welcome 
them and the thirty million people
of bruegher glared at the invasion
knowing not what to do what was
the world coming to

  at nightfall the last little boy had
emptied himself of his brackish con-
tents the last little girl plucked
bawling from a poison ivy nest the
last sardine dispatched the last beer
bottle left a foamy vacuum

  flying away into the night the
american invaders sent back their
war cry which sounded remarkably
like and probably was a belch

  general krauss personal repre-
sentative of bruegher the new semi-
dictator of europe shouted out of
the televisor

  mr president you you were
seen by reliable witnesses to peel an
the irritated people



egg and bit by bit throw the shell
under a one hundred year old linden
tree

  crossley and the president stood
together in the white house inner
sanctum the president spoke
krauss the peace laws specify
no nation may manufacture weapons
for killing wounding or destruction
of anothers national populace or
property we are helpless to attack
you therefore all the while you
in secret make weapons-

  you cant prove that

  -make weapons said the presi-
dent grimly so in last recourse
we use weapons which are not weap-
ons at all we have destroyed noth-
ing and no one

  ah-hah krauss eyes snapped
on the visor hisface vanished a
new scene replaced it showing a
green meadow krauss voice crackled
behind it in comment property
damage to greater bruegher lis-
ten rough estimate sixty-five
thousand ants large and small both
black and red biting and non-bit-
ing were trodden on at your pic-
nic

the scene dissolved to yet another
hark ten million grass-blades
approximately ten million trampled
and crushed two thousand pretty
flowers-picked

  that was an error apologized
crossley the children got out of
hand

  two thousand flowers repeated
krauss savagely picked

  krauss took time to get hold of
himself he cleared his throat and
continued

  approximately thirty billion
atomic particles of wood brushed off
great bruegher sycamores oaks
elms and lindens by adults playing
tree tag-and-sixty million par-
ticles scraped from greater brueg-
her fences by young men escaping
angered greater bruegher bulls
and and- he thundered the
scene dissolved once more and a

most interesting view was revealed
and-sixteen thousand cubic feet
of a-l first class forest moss
crushed rolled upon and otherwise
malpracticed by young lovers idling
in the thickets there you are the
proof the proof this-is war

the first tri-union airships flew
over new york a week later
from them on parachutes little yel-
low boxes floated

  crossley in his garden resting
preparing new methods of attack on
the enemy was astonished as one
of the devices hovered by the red
brick garden wall

  a bomb he cried and leaped
into the house sorry he had started
this infernal war

  edith his wife peered from the
rear window

  oh come back she said its
only a radio

  they listened music blues music
from back in the mad forties
when  wore pigtails said edith
hm said crossley

  the music if such it could be
called concerned a lady afflicted with
-i got those mad about him glad
about him but i get so sad about
him bah-looze

  interesting said crossley
  yes she said

  the song ended they waited
  the song began again

  is that all it plays said edith
i dont see any dials to change
the record with

  oh oh said crossley and shut
his eyes i think i begin to see
the light-

  the song ended and started a
third time

  thats what i expected said
crossley here give me a hand
the song flowed into its fourth
fifth and sixth renditions as they
poked at the dangling machine it
dodged-like a humming-bird ra-
dar-sensitives gasped crossley
giving up oh pfm
  edith covered her ears with her
hands oh charles she said

  they went in the house and shut
the door tight and shut the windows
tighter nevertheless the music
penetrated

  after dinner crossley looked at
edith and said

  what do you make of it

  she counted on her fingers this
next time will be the one hundred
and thirteenth repeat she said

  thats what i counted said he
handing her wads of cotton

  he worked feverishly that evening
he made plans for war using con-
fetti toothpaste tubes that refused
to function a chemical that dulled
razors with the first scrape and-
mmm let me see 

  his young son age twelve was
doing his homework in the next
room

  oblivious to that awful music
said crossley in admiration kids
are marvels can concentrate any-
where he crept up on his son
looked over his shoulder

  the boy was writing a composi-
tion 

  poe authored the cask of amon-
tillado masoue of the red death
and i got those mad about him
clad about him but i get so sad
about him- 

  blues said crossley he turned
edith pack the suitcases were
leaving home

hastily they piled into the fami-
ly heliconter as the helicopter
lifted into the sky crossleys small
son said looking- down at the music
box in the garden two hundredth
time

  crossley hit him

  it was useless to flee the hover-
ing radios were everywhere bawling
they were in the air and on the
ground and under bridges

  they could not be shot down they
dodged and the music played on

  edith glared at her husband who

  was somewhat responsible for all
  this his son tentatively eyed cross-
  leys shins for kicking

    crossley called the president
  you screamed the president
  crossley

    mr president i can exwlain

    so the war progressed the world
  organization hunched forward- ten-
  sely awaiting the moment when
  either side got off bounds fired a
  shot or committed a murder but-
  normal civilized pursuits conti-
  nued imports and exports flowed
  foods clothing raw materials were
  exchanged

    if either country had broken rela-
  tions made guns knives grenades
  the world organization would have
  leaped in but not a gun was fash-
  ioned not a knife sharpened there
  were no murders wounded or
  bruised the world organization
  was helpless there was no war
  well almost none

    heinrich

    yes my wife

    come look at this mirror
  heinrich chief deputy of the po-
  lice department in a greater brue-
  gher village came slopping in his
  easy slippers holding his clay pipe
  like a small tame bird in his hand

    heinrich looked into a mirror that
  was ridiculous like at a carnival

   what has happened to it over
 night he wondered look at me
 ila i look like an idiot he chuckled
 my face stretches like rubber shiv-
 ers is distorted well the mirror
 is warped

   you are warned shouted his
 wife do something abou it

   i will buy a new one in the
 meantime the one upstairs-

    is also warped she snapped
  how will i get my hat on straight
  or see if my lipstick is drawn fine
  or my powder neat clumsy idiot
  hurry and fetch a new one go get
  rush

    crossley had his orders find a
way out or arrange a truce if these

next attacks by the united states
did not produce results the united
states must bargain for peace
peace yes peace from that abom-
inable woman singing the abominable
blues twenty times an hour night
and day the american public would
hold the line as long as possible
said the president but time was
short and puncturing everybodys i
eardrums seemed a most unlikely
way out crossley was to get in
there and pitch

  crossley pitched his jet plane
streaked over europe in the great
offensive three thousand bombloads
of something or other were dropped
at his order and then the three
thousand company ships curved and
shot home he lingered on cruising
the length of europe awaiting re-
sults

  he got them

a large unseeable beam took
hold of his ship and drew it
steadily down into the dark moun-
tains of greater bruegher

  well said crossley adven-
ture

  the entire capture was quiet con-
vivial when he stepped from his
grounded craft he was politely es-
corted into a city of ultra-modern
buildings and avenues between the
mountains and there in a small edi-
fice in a small room he met his
enemy

  krauss sat behind a desk as cross-
ley entered crossley nodded and
bowed

  hello krauss youll be prose-
cuted for kidnapping

  youre free to go any time
snapped krauss this is an inter-
view sit

  the chair was shaped like a low
pyramid you could sit but you slid
in all directions the ceiling where
crossley was expected to sit was
very low he had to choose between
back-ache or slithering around on a
pyramidal chair he chose to slither

  krauss reached over and pinched
crossley

 your wife herr krauss

 all right put her on

 im okay mr president had a
 little engine trouble

 what

 darling the most terrible trou-
 ble

 katrina i have no time there is
 much to do

 this is important you fool its
 horrible

 well what is it my liebchen im
 busy

 answer me crossley were you
 shot down 

 not exactly mr president they
 are trying to figure out a way to kill
 me havent hit on one yet

 mr crossley please not so loud

 i	cant hear my wife talking yes
 darling

 hans hans i have dandruff
 say that again i have so much
 noise here katrina

 ill call you again in an hour mr
 president

 dandruff hans dandruff a
 thousand five thousand flakes on my
 shoulders

 you call to tell me this woman
 good-bye

 bang

 crossley and krauss hung up in
 unison krauss on his wife crossley
 on the president

 where were we said krauss
 sweating

 you were going to kill me re-
 member

 again the phone krauss swore
 and answered what

 hans ive gained ten pounds
 why do you insist  calling to
 tell me these things

 mrs leiber mrs krenschrvitz
 and mrs schmidt they too have
 gained ten pounds

 oh krauss hung up blinking
 so he glared at crossley thats
 what it is all right crossley we
 also can be subtle doctor

 a door slid open in the wall there
 stood an evil-looking rascal sleeves
 rolled high testing a hypodermic on

  his own emaciated arm enjoying it
  he looked up at crossley and said
  practice

    get him cried krauss
    everybody jumped on crossley
    darkness

  how do you feel crossley
  how was he supposed to feel  all
  right he guessed he lifted himself
  from a kind of operating table and
  looked at the doctor and at krauss

    here doctor said krauss ex-
  plain to mr crossley what he may
  expect ten years from now

    ten years said crossley in
  alarm

    the doctor placed his thin fingers
  together bowing he whispered
  daintily

   ten years from now you may
 expect a-ah-little trouble it will
 commence one year from now un-
 obtrusively here or there a slight
 gastric upset a cardiac disturbance
 a minor intra-irritation of the lung
 sacs occasionally a headache a
 sallowness to the complexion an ear-
 ache perhaps

    crossley began to sweat he held
  onto his knees

    the doctor continued slowly
  pleased with himself

    then as the years pass a small
  flicker like bird wings of the heart
  a pain as if stabbed in the groin
  a twitching of the peritoneum a
  hot sweating late of nights drench-
  ing your bedclothes insomnia night
  after night cigarette after cigarette
  headache after headache

     thatll do said crossley bleakly
  no no the doctor waved his
  hypodermic im not finished tem-
  porary blindness i almost forgot
  that yes temporary blindness
  fuzzy lights in your head voices
  paralysis of the lower limbs then
  your heart in one last explosion
  lasting ten days will beat itself into
  a bruised pulp and youll die ex-
  actly- he consulted a mental calen-
  dar -ten days five months and
  fourteen days from today

    the silence in the room was touch-
ed only by crossleys ragged breath-

 ing he tried to lift himself shivered
 fell back

   best of all there will be no evi-
 dence of what we have done to you
 said krauss certain hormones and
 molecular impurities were put into
 your body no analysis now or after
 death would reveal them your
 health will simply fail we will not
 be held responsible clever is it
 not

finally the doctor leered wick-
edly and announced you may go
now now that we have fixed you
like a time-bomb to die later you
are free to go we would not want
to kill you here that would make us
responsib rut ten years from now
in another place how can that be
due to us

  the phone your wife herr
krauss

   my hair is falling out

   now now be patient my wife
 my skin is yellowing do some-
 thing

   i will be home in an hour

   there will be no home here then

sweet

   not on a path strewn with my
golden golden hair

   yes my wife i will say hello to
 the doctor for you

   huns dont you dure hang up on

   krauss sat down fluttering his
 hands weakly my wife called me
 to say all is well

   ha said crossley weakly
 krauss reached over and pinched
 him

youre spoken to hear me
crossley stood up laughing the
doctor looked at him as if he were
insane

  ive got it im going to commit
suicide

  youre crazy said krauss

  ten years from now i die so why
not commit suicide here thus bring-
ing an investigation by the world
organization eh mr krauss

  you cant do that said krauss
dumbfounded i wont permit it
ill jump off a building perhaps
you cant hold me here for more
than another hour or the organi-
zation will come to see what ticks
and the minute you let me go ill
jump off a building

  no

  or crash my ship purposely on
the way home why not whatve

i	to live for and if it causes your
trial so much the better yes ive
decided ill die

  well hold him here said the
doctor to krauss

  we cant said krauss

  release him said the doctor
  dont be silly said krauss
  kill him

  sillier still gasped krauss oh
this is terrible

  which way said crossley to
the tallest building in town

  you go down to the next cor-
ner- said the doctor and stopped
no-stop we must stop him
get out of the way said cross-
ley here i go

  but this is preposterou s
screamed krauss doctor we must
think of something

  women sobbed in the streets their
hair trembling in their hands de-
tached from their heads puddles
formed wherever women met to
weep see see my beautiful hair
fallen your hair you butchers
mate what of mine mine yours
was hempen rope a horses tail but
mine ach mine like wheat in the
high wind falling

  crossley led the doctor and krauss
along a wide street

  what goes on he asked naively
   beast you know well enough

 whispered the doctor fiercely my
 wife my beauteous thickel her
 blonde hairll be a ruin

   speak roughly to me again
 threatened crossley and ill hurl
 myself before this next bus
 dont no cried krauss seizing
 his arm to the doctor fool is
 your wife more important than hang-
 ing

    my wife is as good as your wife
 snarled the doctor katrina and
 her henna rinse

    crossley led the way into a build-
 ing and up in an elevator they
 walked on a terrace at the thirteenth
 floor

    it is a riot moaned the doctor
 surveying the street below the
 women storm the beauty salons de-
 manding help i wonder if my
 thickel is with them raging

 in huge clusters the women of the
 city held their heads in their hands
 as if they might topple and fall plunk
 on the ground they argued phoned
 husbands in high government circles
 sent telegrams to the leader pum-
 meled and kicked a bald man who
 laughed at them in their misery

   pardon me krauss said cross-
 ley there he flicked a constella-
 tion of dandruff from krauss lapel

    my hair said krauss in realiza-

wife the peace terms i reluctantly
accept peace it is

  fine said crossley but one
more term he grabbed the doctor
held him out over the edge as if
to drop him

  stop frantically the doctor
squirmed i lied we did nothing
to you it was psychological youd
have worried to death in ten years
crossley was so astonished he let
go

  he and krauss stared down at the
dwindling doctor falling

  i didnt really mean to drop him
said crossley

  squish murmured krauss a
moment later looking down

  crossley pushed his jet-ship home
edith its over the musicll be

  darling she radioed howd
you do it

  simple they thought it enough
to irritate people that was their
error they didnt strike psycholog-
ically deep enough their type of
irritant only touched surfaces made
people mad-

  and sleepy

  but we attacked their ego which
was something else people can stand
radios confetti gum and mosqui-
toes but they wont take baldness or
turning yellow it was unthinkable
edith ran to meet him as he
landed the radio still hung in the
garden drifting singing

  what do you make it now he
cried

  she kissed him

pulling back she counted swiftly
inside her head glanced at the float-
ing radio and said automatically
